[00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:32.670]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.932]  What we are looking at...
[00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:48.099]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, June 21st, 2019.
[00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:59.323]  We just kicked off this worldwide live radio slash TV broadcast to the horror and the disgust of the globalist.
[00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:04.845]  This is the tip of the spear in the fight for a pro-human future.
[00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:07.166]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.067]  Well, my friends, where should we start?
[00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:18.086]  Trump ordered military strike on Iran, then backed off hours later.
[00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:24.371]  The Iranians say that Trump called them to say that we have aircraft on the way.
[00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:30.636]  We're going to bomb your missile installations that fired these weapons at our aircraft.
[00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:38.123]  And then he called right back and said, we're not doing it.
[00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:39.644]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.672]  That's a big deal.
[00:01:43.672 --> 00:02:05.002]  And I happen to know the inside baseball of what went on, and I'm not at liberty to get into it, but I can tell you this, everybody better think they're lucky stars for people like Tucker Carlson and the guest he had on last night.
[00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:05.362]  Because
[00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:15.726]  The President basically watches Fox News 18 hours a day when he's not out doing public events or reading letters.
[00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:19.288]  Let's just say this, it's on in the background.
[00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:30.154]  And Sean Hannity foaming at the mouth for war turned Trump off.
[00:02:30.154 --> 00:02:36.358]  And then the way Tucker Carlson handles it, and of course Trump calls him smartest newsman out there, it's pretty much true.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.985]  Carlson has really matured into, if he was a racehorse, he'd be a triple crown winner.
[00:02:46.985 --> 00:03:01.014]  But let me tell you something, it's scary to know that somebody I used to make fun of and not like when he was more of a liberal on CNN is the only thing standing between us and potentially World War III.
[00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:19.386]  Because when Daily Beast, who normally lies a lot, got it right a few days ago when they made fun of Tucker and said, oh, look, he's the one keeping Trump from attacking, according to people in the White House.
[00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:21.968]  He had the left allied with the warmongering neocons.
[00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:26.230]  What a disgusting group of people.
[00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.014]  There's a lot more to this, too, from my sources that are not Tucker Carlson.
[00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:35.847]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:03:35.847 --> 00:03:42.612]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:47.275]  But I do know a lot more than I can tell you.
[00:03:47.275 --> 00:03:49.577]  And let's just say this.
[00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:57.924]  It's very dangerous trying to hold up a new big war where globalists will make hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:03:57.924 --> 00:04:03.848]  But everybody in Washington knows who's behind this and who's pushing this.
[00:04:03.848 --> 00:04:04.609]  The neocons.
[00:04:06.198 --> 00:04:09.179]  Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.060]  And I am not an enemy of Israel.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.981]  I'm glad that there is a country there that has some basic freedoms and things.
[00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:17.822]  It's not perfect.
[00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:21.603]  If the Islamists were given Israel, they'd fight over it forever like they've always done.
[00:04:21.603 --> 00:04:30.346]  That said, if Israel wants to go to war with Iran, they are big boys and they can do it.
[00:04:30.346 --> 00:04:32.107]  And the same thing goes for Saudi Arabia.
[00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:37.199]  So, I don't want to be a power slave of Israel.
[00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.961]  I don't want to be Israel's attack dog.
[00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:41.062]  And I don't want World War III.
[00:04:41.062 --> 00:04:45.326]  Now, we're going to get more into this when we come back, and so much more.
[00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:49.249]  They have gone into overdrive with their disinfo against myself and Owen Schroer.
[00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:50.951]  They are really trying to T.S.
[00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:52.472]  up to be taken down.
[00:04:52.472 --> 00:04:53.833]  So, read your prayers, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.915]  Wait until you hear all this.
[00:04:55.915 --> 00:04:57.937]  Big broadcast on this Friday edition.
[00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:10.437]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[00:05:10.437 --> 00:05:19.459]  The false claim that you purposely said kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false.
[00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:20.580]  It's a smear.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.780]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.261]  You don't even open it.
[00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:29.262]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you.
[00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:38.486]  This is bizarre, but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say Jones sent kiddie porn is really outrageous.
[00:05:38.486 --> 00:05:44.168]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:45.709]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:46.909]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.610]  Where's Associated Press?
[00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:54.153]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:59.595]  So we both need your help, and I urge folks to continue to support InfoWars with your dollars.
[00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:02.687]  We've got it.
[00:06:02.687 --> 00:06:08.353]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:12.757]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:18.382]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:36.405]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us on this June 21st, 2019 Global Transmission.
[00:06:36.405 --> 00:06:40.988]  We'll be here live for the next four hours, then I'll be back this Sunday as well, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:40.988 --> 00:06:42.509]  with a Sunday transmission.
[00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.110]  Owen Troyer, I'll knock it out of the park.
[00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.451]  As usual, 3 p.m.
[00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.714]  Central as well, David Knight.
[00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:51.335]  Kicking it all off, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:54.197]  for The David Knight Show.
[00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:57.259]  Syndicated radio, TV transmission, dominating the internet.
[00:06:58.214 --> 00:07:12.584]  Dominating, relaunching, Americana, 1776 worldwide, promoting true populism and renaissance culture, and a pro-human future, so we are enemy number one, only after Trump, to the globalists.
[00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:16.626]  Okay, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.468]  Dramatic cliffhanger events.
[00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:25.312]  The Iranians have pledged that if any of their installations get bombed or targeted, they're going to fire more than 100,000 missiles.
[00:07:28.337 --> 00:07:32.078]  at Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:48.002]  Then a giant war will kick off that most analysts believe will suck Russia and China into it, but at bare minimum, in Vladimir Putin's words, will be a catastrophe even if it is contained.
[00:07:48.002 --> 00:07:52.903]  Trump reportedly had decided to have the strikes carried out.
[00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:56.364]  Then, hours before the bombs started falling,
[00:07:57.563 --> 00:08:03.104]  After aircraft had already taken off, they were ordered to be pulled back.
[00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:11.046]  Now, I don't normally believe mainstream media, but now it's been confirmed that indeed that is what happened.
[00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:23.008]  And the Iranians said that Trump called them up and said, look, tit for tat, you shot down our aircraft, we're taking a few of these ships, we're gonna bomb some of these missile bases, you got a couple hours to get people out of them.
[00:08:23.008 --> 00:08:25.229]  We don't want to kill anybody, but it's tit for tat.
[00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:33.064]  Whatever the Iranian said, Trump called back minutes later and said, now we're not going to strike.
[00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:36.525]  It's off.
[00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:40.305]  And you need to negotiate, reportedly Trump told him.
[00:08:40.305 --> 00:08:46.946]  And the word is he's really having trouble stopping the neocons kicking off a new war.
[00:08:46.946 --> 00:08:54.308]  Now the best way to break this down is to air a Tucker Carlson piece from last night dealing with the warmongers.
[00:08:54.308 --> 00:08:55.868]  And then we'll dig more into this.
[00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:03.108]  Then coming up, Border Patrol, sector facilities at more than double capacity.
[00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:06.530]  That's why we've got to send a strong message and start deporting people in MASH.
[00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.613]  Or more will come, and then the whole system will completely fail.
[00:09:09.613 --> 00:09:15.938]  It's already collapsed, but it will permanently fail.
[00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:19.761]  It's like having a tiny blood vessel in your brain leaking.
[00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:23.424]  And you're sick, you can't see, you've got to have brain surgery.
[00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:25.246]  But if a big one busts, you just die.
[00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:32.883]  So that's the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:32.883 --> 00:09:45.049]  And Trump is deporting at a slower rate than Obama because the whole system is completely overwhelmed and everybody they have in the Border Patrol and ICE is at the border trying to stem the flow just there.
[00:09:45.049 --> 00:09:46.529]  And that's why there's a huge backlog.
[00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:48.950]  The dam has broken.
[00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.972]  It's going to take dramatic action to stop it.
[00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:53.932]  That's all coming up.
[00:09:53.932 --> 00:09:59.535]  Also, a Polish Member of Parliament invites AOC for educational visit to real concentration camps.
[00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:10.669]  Yeah, no, it's not a concentration camp when a hundred thousand people every couple weeks or so get caught and you've got to try to screen them.
[00:10:10.669 --> 00:10:15.712]  I mean, what do you think happens anywhere else in the world?
[00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:17.473]  This is completely normal.
[00:10:17.473 --> 00:10:20.755]  These people are fleeing hell in many cases.
[00:10:20.755 --> 00:10:28.139]  Many cases, a third of the children have been kidnapped and we're trying to check to see who their mommy really is.
[00:10:28.139 --> 00:10:28.819]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.343]  And they're saying, no, we don't want that.
[00:10:34.343 --> 00:10:38.727]  What a monstrous evil woman AOC is.
[00:10:38.727 --> 00:10:45.755]  Meanwhile, speaking of women, three female athletes filed federal complaint over transgender competition.
[00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:48.938]  Three high school girls from Connecticut.
[00:10:48.938 --> 00:10:52.922]  Just saying the word girl is hateful because some people don't consider that to be a gender.
[00:10:52.922 --> 00:10:54.424]  The left actually teaches that.
[00:10:55.885 --> 00:11:04.086]  Three high school girls from Connecticut have filed a federal discrimination complaint over being forced to race against biological males in track competitions.
[00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:06.087]  Hey, I got a better idea.
[00:11:06.087 --> 00:11:09.587]  Let's say your daughters were playing softball.
[00:11:09.587 --> 00:11:13.468]  And you showed up to the softball to play a team and half of them were boys.
[00:11:13.468 --> 00:11:16.108]  You'd say, hey, I'm taking my girls home.
[00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:19.109]  That league would just collapse.
[00:11:19.109 --> 00:11:24.150]  And I understand these are public schools, but people need to not participate in any of this.
[00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.950]  And then let it be
[00:11:26.457 --> 00:11:35.583]  You know, the two transgender boys that have already won the state championship and have genitals, male genitals and male bodies and male hearts and male blood.
[00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.304]  Let them have their farce.
[00:11:37.304 --> 00:11:41.647]  But see, they want to hijack every institution.
[00:11:41.647 --> 00:11:51.574]  And so it's men winning all the track, men winning all the cycling, men winning all of the wrestling and the powerlifting, winning everything.
[00:11:51.574 --> 00:11:55.977]  Imagine your daughter is playing rugby and a giant man
[00:11:57.162 --> 00:12:07.011]  Who couldn't make it in regular rugby, is now on the field, assaulting her.
[00:12:07.011 --> 00:12:16.439]  Yeah, remember the guy that came in and yelled and screamed, ma'am, it's ma'am, and he photos him in prison, bench pressing 400 pounds?
[00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:23.586]  The power lifter, a prisoner, who wants to bully people, so he wears a pink shirt,
[00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:28.535]  Hey guys, we're ready for you.
[00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:30.436]  It's ma'am!
[00:12:30.436 --> 00:12:32.498]  I'm a psychotic!
[00:12:32.498 --> 00:12:37.702]  And I'm going to bully you.
[00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:40.684]  Gotta find the prison photos of that guy.
[00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:41.685]  Shocking.
[00:12:41.685 --> 00:12:46.528]  Now, I digress again.
[00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:48.109]  I had an epiphany about the future.
[00:12:48.109 --> 00:12:49.850]  I'm gonna talk about that later if I don't forget.
[00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.173]  But it ties into the land where the internet ends from the New York Times.
[00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:54.794]  We're gonna get into that.
[00:12:56.405 --> 00:13:00.889]  Also, we're going to look at some of these new big AI developments.
[00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:05.774]  And you'd think you'd never agree with Maxine Waters, but I agree with her on one thing.
[00:13:05.774 --> 00:13:09.578]  She thinks that Facebook's new digital currency is dangerous.
[00:13:09.578 --> 00:13:15.043]  Well, that's because her husband owns a big bank that she swindles money through on record.
[00:13:15.043 --> 00:13:16.484]  It's been ruled illegal, but she can do it.
[00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:18.446]  Don't want to be racist.
[00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:24.514]  Tens of millions of dollars for her husband, so she gets, well that's competition against regular banks!
[00:13:24.514 --> 00:13:26.034]  Can't do that!
[00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:31.056]  No, the problem isn't that lady, it's that it has blockchain.
[00:13:31.056 --> 00:13:42.720]  And so everything you ever buy and everything you ever do and who it passes to will all be tracked, which is perfect for the global social score and social conditioning and social engineering, which Facebook admits they're going to do.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.601]  They said, watch what you say anywhere, not just on Facebook.
[00:13:46.823 --> 00:13:49.204]  We'll punish you for off-platform activity.
[00:13:49.204 --> 00:13:55.005]  Oh, well that's okay, but then they buy up every other tech company, along with Google.
[00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:57.465]  Thousands of companies a year.
[00:13:57.465 --> 00:14:01.086]  And then they have the global currency approved by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan.
[00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:03.687]  That means that this is the global currency.
[00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:06.788]  CIA created Facebook, that's on record.
[00:14:06.788 --> 00:14:10.569]  Their LifeLog project, end of the day, Facebook launched.
[00:14:10.569 --> 00:14:12.269]  And this is the world government, this is the system.
[00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:26.022]  Oh, speaking of censorship, YouTube was given a list by their boss, the system run by George Soros.
[00:14:26.022 --> 00:14:35.749]  They were given a list of dozens of YouTube sites that are posting, in part, my information.
[00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:37.571]  And they act like that's illegal for you
[00:14:39.076 --> 00:14:44.760]  To talk about Alex Jones, or for you to post Alex Jones, or for you to edit Alex Jones, or for you to whatever.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.542]  And so they promptly deleted them all.
[00:14:46.542 --> 00:15:03.374]  But now, on a roll of fraud, Media Matters has listed Caitlin Bennett, who's been around for years and does do work for us, but it's her out there never violating rules, never getting strikes, being very gentlemanly, very ladylike.
[00:15:03.374 --> 00:15:04.775]  Millennia Millie.
[00:15:04.775 --> 00:15:06.317]  She's had her sight eight years.
[00:15:07.588 --> 00:15:10.511]  She does a lot of different stuff on there, including stuff for us.
[00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:13.134]  Harrison Smith does his own reports.
[00:15:13.134 --> 00:15:17.780]  And Paul Joseph Watson, they say we want them taken down now.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.042]  They're copycats.
[00:15:20.042 --> 00:15:22.405]  Remember Facebook?
[00:15:22.405 --> 00:15:23.446]  Remember Facebook?
[00:15:23.446 --> 00:15:28.372]  Just two months ago said you will not say his name unless it's negative, then you're allowed.
[00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:31.125]  They're like, oh, that's okay.
[00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:32.046]  I'll just go somewhere else.
[00:15:32.046 --> 00:15:34.086]  No, they'll just buy a company you go to.
[00:15:34.086 --> 00:15:35.747]  The new social media.
[00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:36.407]  Oh, that's okay.
[00:15:36.407 --> 00:15:37.747]  I don't need to be on the internet.
[00:15:37.747 --> 00:15:39.788]  Oh, we heard what you said on the street corner, though.
[00:15:39.788 --> 00:15:40.828]  Somebody picked it up.
[00:15:40.828 --> 00:15:42.529]  So Facebook took your currency away.
[00:15:42.529 --> 00:15:44.469]  But if you're good, they'll make your currency worth more.
[00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:46.490]  It's called the mark of the beast.
[00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.091]  We got warned about it 2,000 years ago.
[00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:51.151]  There's so much more coming up.
[00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:55.893]  We'll delve into Iran, this powerful Tucker Carlson report, and the fact that the neocons aren't stopping.
[00:15:55.893 --> 00:15:56.653]  They want war.
[00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:57.073]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.448 --> 00:16:00.689]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.689 --> 00:16:04.610]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.131]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.093]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:14.655]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.655 --> 00:16:15.856]  I can help you, too.

[00:17:07.142 --> 00:17:13.707]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:13.707 --> 00:17:18.771]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:23.475]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:17:23.915 --> 00:17:27.017]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.003]  Big Brother.
[00:20:15.003 --> 00:20:17.266]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:19.129]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:19.129 --> 00:20:21.192]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:21.192 --> 00:20:23.356]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:27.943]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:46.702]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, there have been big new developments in whoever attempted to plant child porn on us.
[00:20:46.702 --> 00:20:54.006]  And the FBI, again, has had multiple conversations with my lawyer, Norm Pattis, and they've given us a letter.
[00:20:54.006 --> 00:20:55.146]  They actually did it several days ago.
[00:20:55.146 --> 00:20:56.607]  I've just been so busy.
[00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:59.948]  We're about to release an article on Infowars.com with Paul Watson.
[00:20:59.948 --> 00:21:02.950]  We just wanted to also get the authorization to delete it.
[00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.771]  They said that, yes, obviously delete it.
[00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:07.332]  That's not obstructing because you're the victim, not a suspect.
[00:21:08.331 --> 00:21:18.677]  And we also want to know the procedure to put out the metadata without the metadata that could reconstruct the potentially illegal images, because the FBI calls them potentially illegal.
[00:21:18.677 --> 00:21:20.818]  I've never seen them.
[00:21:20.818 --> 00:21:22.899]  Norm will be joining us next segment.
[00:21:22.899 --> 00:21:25.220]  There is a $100,000 reward.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:34.065]  I don't have a million dollars, plus I put the offer out wrong, but I've paid $115,000 out before for one contest.
[00:21:34.065 --> 00:21:36.146]  We've paid out close to a million dollars in contest total.
[00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:45.405]  There will be $100,000 for anyone that gives information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator or perpetrators.
[00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:52.249]  We're going to put some leads out and some metadata and email addresses to who did this.
[00:21:52.249 --> 00:21:59.633]  It was connected to so-called QAnon and it was done right when I criticized QAnon.
[00:22:02.597 --> 00:22:07.802]  As I've always been clear, I'm not saying that the lawyers for Sandy Hook or the families are the ones that did this.
[00:22:07.802 --> 00:22:09.664]  The media said that.
[00:22:09.664 --> 00:22:23.736]  I'm pissed because we spent tons of money going through all the emails that they demanded and that they know damn well when they ran to the cops with this, reportedly trying to get me indicted for it, that that's wrong.
[00:22:24.571 --> 00:22:25.852]  And that's why I'm pissed.
[00:22:25.852 --> 00:22:27.593]  And I never made threats to him either.
[00:22:27.593 --> 00:22:31.275]  I said, whoever did this, I metaphorically want to see you with your head on a pike.
[00:22:31.275 --> 00:22:33.736]  I want to see you in prison.
[00:22:33.736 --> 00:22:37.058]  So I'm sick of the media misrepresenting all that, but I'll talk more about it coming up next segment.
[00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:46.003]  I want to get into the whole situation with Iran and how dangerous all of that is.
[00:22:46.003 --> 00:22:49.945]  And the fact that the neocons are still
[00:22:52.824 --> 00:22:58.827]  We're trying to start a war harder than ever, and Tucker Carlson has done a great job breaking all that down.
[00:22:58.827 --> 00:23:10.633]  Before I go to that clip, though, it is essential for folks to understand that this is a battle of wills, and the globalists are working around the clock with everything they've got to shut us down.
[00:23:10.633 --> 00:23:21.438]  But like an arm wrestling contest, when you get focused, when you spread the word, when you pray for us, when you buy the products at InfoWarsTore.com that are already great, that you already need, it stands in defiance of them.
[00:23:23.581 --> 00:23:25.463]  And they are beside themselves now.
[00:23:25.463 --> 00:23:28.187]  They don't know what to do.
[00:23:28.187 --> 00:23:30.249]  They don't know how to respond.
[00:23:30.249 --> 00:23:31.831]  And they're unable to shut others down.
[00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:33.213]  So this is a real battle of wills.
[00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:36.963]  And Trump says he's preparing to move against them with antitrust.
[00:23:36.963 --> 00:23:38.803]  He's moved against the universities.
[00:23:38.803 --> 00:23:45.404]  And so has the governor of Texas and their discrimination against conservative and nationalist and Christian views.
[00:23:45.404 --> 00:23:46.324]  So we're fighting back.
[00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:50.165]  But this operation really is the tip of the spear.
[00:23:50.165 --> 00:23:51.625]  The enemy wants to capture the flag.
[00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:58.666]  They want to capture the standard because they understand that we really have our ear to the ground and know what we're doing.
[00:23:58.666 --> 00:24:02.007]  There's very few people out there the president actually listens to.
[00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:02.647]  But the president
[00:24:03.635 --> 00:24:04.196]  Yes, we are.
[00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.270]  Every day.
[00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.271]  And I am in the clips.
[00:24:23.271 --> 00:24:24.311]  You are in the clips.
[00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:29.993]  Seriously, listeners, he scans what everybody's doing, particularly Tucker Carlson and InfoWars.
[00:24:29.993 --> 00:24:32.633]  And that's why they want us off the air.
[00:24:32.633 --> 00:24:35.454]  That's why it's essential that we're running one of the biggest specials ever.
[00:24:35.454 --> 00:24:36.754]  It's got to end soon.
[00:24:36.754 --> 00:24:37.875]  Same InfoWars special.
[00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:41.576]  I want to thank you who have contributed by getting great products and supporting us.

[00:25:03.122 --> 00:25:04.083]  It tastes great.
[00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.464]  No sweetener added.
[00:25:05.464 --> 00:25:08.085]  B12, natural B12, tastes sweet.

[00:25:15.967 --> 00:25:19.631]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site or 888-253-3139.
[00:25:19.631 --> 00:25:23.796]  You can also call and get the PO Box at that address as well or it's on the internet.
[00:25:23.796 --> 00:25:27.380]  Whatever you do, please take action today in defiance of these bullies.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.182]  I won't back down, but I could.
[00:25:30.438 --> 00:25:31.520]  Be crushed.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.386]  See, I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[00:25:34.386 --> 00:25:35.969]  You, literally, hold us up.
[00:25:35.969 --> 00:25:37.011]  So thank you.
[00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:37.713]  I salute you.
[00:25:37.713 --> 00:25:38.555]  I'm in your hands.
[00:25:38.555 --> 00:25:40.258]  Here's part of Tucker Carlson's report.
[00:25:40.258 --> 00:25:41.761]  The full report's on Infowars.com.
[00:25:42.776 --> 00:25:44.057]  Since 9-11, the U.S.
[00:25:44.057 --> 00:25:51.121]  has spent trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives trying to remake the Middle East in our image.
[00:25:51.121 --> 00:25:53.443]  It's sad to say it out loud, but we have to.
[00:25:53.443 --> 00:25:54.583]  It hasn't worked.
[00:25:54.583 --> 00:25:56.044]  Many of us thought it would, but it hasn't.
[00:25:56.044 --> 00:26:02.068]  By every measure, our foreign wars have ended in dismal failure for the United States, however noble their intentions.
[00:26:02.068 --> 00:26:03.349]  And some did have noble intentions.
[00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:07.952]  Donald Trump was one of the rare Republican politicians honest enough to admit this.
[00:26:07.952 --> 00:26:13.136]  He said it out loud three years ago and promised not to repeat the same mistakes if elected president.
[00:26:13.136 --> 00:26:16.879]  And partly because he said that, he was elected president.
[00:26:16.879 --> 00:26:18.760]  Now something fascinating is happening.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:27.507]  The very people, in some cases literally the same people, who lured us into the Iraq quagmire 16 years ago, are demanding a new war.
[00:26:27.507 --> 00:26:28.468]  This one with Iran.
[00:26:29.068 --> 00:26:32.573]  The President, to his great credit, appears to be skeptical of this.
[00:26:32.573 --> 00:26:33.915]  Very skeptical.
[00:26:33.915 --> 00:26:37.080]  Iran recently downed an unmanned American drone.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.368]  The President, speaking today, seemed to suggest this shouldn't necessarily trigger a conflict with Iran.
[00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:43.009]  Watch.
[00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:44.111]  Iran made a big mistake.
[00:26:45.839 --> 00:26:48.541]  This drone was in international waters.
[00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:50.063]  Clearly, we have it all documented.
[00:26:50.063 --> 00:26:56.827]  I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down.
[00:26:56.827 --> 00:26:59.169]  And fortunately, that drone was unarmed.
[00:26:59.169 --> 00:27:01.991]  It was not, there was no man in it.
[00:27:01.991 --> 00:27:06.895]  And there was no, it was just, it was over international waters, clearly over international waters.
[00:27:06.895 --> 00:27:08.676]  But we didn't have a man or woman in the drone.
[00:27:08.676 --> 00:27:09.757]  We had nobody in the drone.
[00:27:10.557 --> 00:27:12.359]  Would have made a big difference, let me tell you.
[00:27:12.359 --> 00:27:14.040]  Would have made a big, big difference.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.022]  I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth.
[00:27:17.022 --> 00:27:22.006]  I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.
[00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:34.668]  So that's not nearly bellicose enough for the permanent foreign policy establishment in Washington, many of whom crave a war with Iran and see every provocation as an opportunity to start one.
[00:27:34.668 --> 00:27:41.353]  Senator Lindsey Graham, for example, says Americans ought to be ready to fight and die for shipping lanes on the other side of the world.
[00:27:41.353 --> 00:27:41.594]  Watch.
[00:27:42.134 --> 00:27:43.835]  So here's what to watch for.
[00:27:43.835 --> 00:27:59.304]  If the Iranians follow through on their threat to start enriching again at higher levels, to basically take their enrichment program to a kind of a nuclear level in terms of weapons grade production, Israel's in a world of hurt.
[00:27:59.304 --> 00:28:01.586]  So the best thing the President can do is stop that.
[00:28:01.586 --> 00:28:02.586]  And how do you stop that?
[00:28:02.586 --> 00:28:05.428]  To make Iran understand you're not going to let that happen.
[00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:12.591]  I think he should put their ore refineries on our target list, that he should look at sinking the Iranian Navy if they attack shipping again.
[00:28:14.477 --> 00:28:15.538]  Uh-huh.
[00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:21.342]  So in Washington, there are no real consequences for being wrong, and as a result, policymakers are.
[00:28:21.342 --> 00:28:23.824]  They make the same mistakes again and again.
[00:28:23.824 --> 00:28:25.625]  And it's certainly not just Lindsey Graham.
[00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:31.389]  At the New York Times, left-wing warmonger Brett Stevens is also calling on America to sink the Iranian Navy.
[00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:33.470]  Many on the left are for it.
[00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.072]  John Bolton cheers him on from within the White House.
[00:28:36.072 --> 00:28:38.534]  Bill Kristol nods with approval from outside the White House.
[00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:42.092]  None of these people will admit their actual intentions.
[00:28:42.092 --> 00:28:44.534]  Let's tell you, they don't really want a war with Iran.
[00:28:44.534 --> 00:28:45.615]  That's a crock.
[00:28:45.615 --> 00:28:47.056]  They want a war badly.
[00:28:47.056 --> 00:28:48.897]  Badly enough to lie about it.
[00:28:48.897 --> 00:28:54.703]  That's why they're putting American troops into situations where conflict is inevitable, in order to start a war.
[00:28:54.703 --> 00:28:57.025]  Everyone in Washington knows exactly what's happening.
[00:28:57.025 --> 00:28:58.206]  They've seen it many times before.
[00:28:59.847 --> 00:29:10.893]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[00:30:00.538 --> 00:30:03.120]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:08.344]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have.
[00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:11.006]  There's their criminal activity in there and their digital fraud.
[00:30:11.006 --> 00:30:14.669]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:15.590]  We need to end here.
[00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.931]  We need to be provisioned.
[00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:18.572]  And you've got my total commitment.
[00:30:18.672 --> 00:30:21.513]  That I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[00:30:21.513 --> 00:30:25.355]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[00:30:25.355 --> 00:30:27.296]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[00:30:27.296 --> 00:30:32.278]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[00:30:32.278 --> 00:30:35.579]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[00:30:35.579 --> 00:30:36.419]  I need gas.
[00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:37.960]  I need ammo politically now.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:45.766]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:47.167]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[00:30:47.167 --> 00:30:54.213]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[00:30:54.213 --> 00:30:55.193]  You have my commitment.
[00:30:55.193 --> 00:30:59.537]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:02.502]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:31:02.502 --> 00:31:03.142]  Go ahead.
[00:31:03.142 --> 00:31:05.343]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[00:31:05.343 --> 00:31:09.224]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:10.665]  It just gets old, man.
[00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:13.066]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:31:13.066 --> 00:31:15.386]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:31:15.386 --> 00:31:19.408]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:31:19.408 --> 00:31:21.829]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:31:22.709 --> 00:31:25.390]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.731]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:31:26.731 --> 00:31:27.851]  Us being shut down?
[00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:29.352]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:31:29.352 --> 00:31:30.412]  You know what, Alex?
[00:31:30.412 --> 00:31:31.773]  Put him on pause again.
[00:31:31.773 --> 00:31:32.613]  Hey, Frank!
[00:31:32.613 --> 00:31:38.275]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:31:38.275 --> 00:31:42.777]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:31:42.777 --> 00:31:45.938]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:46.399]  You understand?
[00:31:46.399 --> 00:31:48.039]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.160]  I need your help, Frank!

[00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:56.490]  Do you understand?

[00:31:57.732 --> 00:31:59.575]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!

[00:33:22.654 --> 00:33:22.814]  Yeah.
[00:33:38.109 --> 00:33:55.338]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up in the next hour, I'm going to open the phones up and cover the waterfront of the week's news and the latest breaking information and obviously what you think about the Iran situation, where the globalists are still going to try to kick off a war in the next coming days and weeks and months.
[00:33:56.238 --> 00:33:58.420]  Probably sooner rather than later.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.303]  Trump reportedly was going to hit them yesterday.
[00:34:01.303 --> 00:34:03.525]  Retaliation for a drone shot down.
[00:34:03.525 --> 00:34:05.026]  Then he pulled back at the last minute.
[00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:07.629]  We'll look at every angle of this.
[00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:11.472]  Maybe even try to get Joel Skousen to pop back in for one segment.
[00:34:11.472 --> 00:34:15.216]  Coming up in the two hours after this one.
[00:34:15.216 --> 00:34:18.539]  There's a lot of other news with the Communist Party calling for more violence in the U.S.
[00:34:18.539 --> 00:34:19.419]  Getting more people elected.
[00:34:19.419 --> 00:34:20.761]  We're gonna look more at that.
[00:34:21.963 --> 00:34:36.406]  We're going to look at how women are fighting back in sports and other places against biological men dominating all the sporting events, so people are finally finding their backbone and saying no to this insanity.
[00:34:36.406 --> 00:34:41.207]  But for the next two segments, we have a lot of really big breaking news.
[00:34:41.207 --> 00:34:49.229]  And I just want to state this again, because I don't like talking about myself every day on the show and what's happening, but we're forced to because, as you've seen, we're national news.
[00:34:49.229 --> 00:34:49.889]  International news.
[00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:55.717]  If they can take us down, they set the precedent to take everyone else down.
[00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:58.677]  Media Matters, run by George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator.
[00:34:58.677 --> 00:35:01.238]  He said that on 60 Minutes.
[00:35:01.238 --> 00:35:05.339]  The news says that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:08.439]  George Soros' Media Matters.
[00:35:08.439 --> 00:35:12.020]  In fact, I have another list of those that I believe, Daria, you just printed.
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.820]  Can I have that list from yesterday?
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:19.501]  Because they've updated their article now.
[00:35:20.556 --> 00:35:23.298]  And it shows the new sites that they want banned.
[00:35:23.298 --> 00:35:34.604]  But they created a list of sites that post some of my content on YouTube.
[00:35:34.604 --> 00:35:35.445]  And here it is.
[00:35:35.445 --> 00:35:38.066]  And most of these I've never even heard of.
[00:35:38.066 --> 00:35:39.927]  InfoWarsFans.
[00:35:39.927 --> 00:35:41.088]  Grand.
[00:35:41.088 --> 00:35:42.308]  Tyranny Crusher.
[00:35:42.308 --> 00:35:42.929]  Heard of that one.
[00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:44.670]  General Shepard.
[00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.390]  Eric Miller.
[00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.710]  Max.
[00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:47.451]  I mean, I've hardly heard of any of these.
[00:35:47.451 --> 00:35:48.232]  Baked Blunts.
[00:35:49.733 --> 00:35:51.615]  Infowars?
[00:35:51.615 --> 00:35:54.837]  Does that say EU?
[00:35:54.837 --> 00:35:59.221]  And they said, oh look, they're posting his content, take them down.
[00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:00.642]  And YouTube did.
[00:36:00.642 --> 00:36:08.209]  I mean, when Media Matters snaps its fingers and says, jump, Google, a trillion dollar company, ask how high?
[00:36:08.209 --> 00:36:10.050]  Well, they were a trillion dollar company.
[00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:15.455]  They've lost $137 billion since it was announced they're going to be breaking up via antitrust because of their censorship of yours.
[00:36:15.455 --> 00:36:17.757]  Truly, Trump's singled us out specifically by name.
[00:36:18.951 --> 00:36:21.373]  I hope he goes ahead and lets the other shoe drop on that.
[00:36:21.373 --> 00:36:33.882]  But then today they put out a new report on the same article, Update 2, and it says, every copycat channel listed has been uploaded, M4's content has been removed.
[00:36:33.882 --> 00:36:37.965]  And most now showing a message saying they were terminated for a violation of YouTube's Terms of Service.
[00:36:37.965 --> 00:36:40.167]  The channels for M4's personalities remain up.
[00:36:42.586 --> 00:36:57.898]  Other people that we sponsor, that are contractors, who already had their own channels, who wanted to do work with us, who go out and do man-on-the-street great work, never violate YouTube's strict rules, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett, they are now targeted for deletion.
[00:36:57.898 --> 00:37:05.123]  And the bosses of Google over at Media Matters in DC are very upset.
[00:37:05.123 --> 00:37:05.904]  Liberty Hangout,
[00:37:06.838 --> 00:37:10.560]  Seems to mainly post content from InfoWars personality Kaitlin Bennett.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.863]  No, it's Kaitlin Bennett, a journalism graduate's site.
[00:37:14.863 --> 00:37:17.204]  A nice young lady.
[00:37:17.204 --> 00:37:19.545]  And you don't like her having speech, you want to get rid of her.
[00:37:19.545 --> 00:37:21.186]  Millennial Millie.
[00:37:21.186 --> 00:37:22.087]  Millie Weaver.
[00:37:22.087 --> 00:37:22.947]  Known her eight years.
[00:37:22.947 --> 00:37:25.789]  She's been reporting for us off and on as a contractor for eight years.
[00:37:25.789 --> 00:37:27.289]  Never gotten in trouble.
[00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:28.610]  They want her banned.
[00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:31.172]  Harrison Smith does his own reports for InfoWars.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.302]  Was up there pre-ban.
[00:37:33.302 --> 00:37:38.669]  And of course, Paul Joseph Watson, he's had that YouTube channel eight years.
[00:37:38.669 --> 00:37:40.231]  Eight years!
[00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:42.234]  Never violates all the rules, any of it.
[00:37:42.234 --> 00:37:45.959]  They want him gone, because they're copycats of me.
[00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:49.364]  Now, it's not just ban Alex Jones, it's ban anyone that sounds like him.
[00:37:50.839 --> 00:37:57.161]  Anybody that doesn't want all the state championships for track to be won by men running against women.
[00:37:57.161 --> 00:37:59.141]  Anybody that doesn't want war with Iran.
[00:37:59.141 --> 00:38:06.923]  Anybody that's worried about 5G or glyphosate or GMOs or vaccine dangers and liability protection.
[00:38:06.923 --> 00:38:08.483]  Or secret government experimentation.
[00:38:08.483 --> 00:38:13.944]  Or anybody that's worried about collapsing borders or anybody worried about not having jobs and the Rust Belt.
[00:38:13.944 --> 00:38:16.025]  You know, all the really evil stuff I talk about.
[00:38:16.991 --> 00:38:18.893]  No, the truth is, I don't say a lot of bad things.
[00:38:18.893 --> 00:38:21.395]  They take out of context what I've said and lie about it.
[00:38:21.395 --> 00:38:27.360]  That's why my lawyer, Norm Pattis, is joining us for the next three segments, or what's left of this one and two more.
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:43.773]  Next segment, we'll get into the United States Department of Justice letter, and the reward we have out, and them confirming that we're not suspects as they talked to Norm last week, and the fact that we're allowed to delete it now because that won't be obstruction, because they have copies of it.
[00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:46.517]  And that they were doing an investigation.
[00:38:46.517 --> 00:38:51.738]  I'm going to show you who did it, how they hid it, saying it was photos of Rockefeller.
[00:38:51.738 --> 00:38:53.239]  And things.
[00:38:53.239 --> 00:38:56.340]  But also putting Sandy Hook in the byline.
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:05.983]  Right at the time I was being first sued, having Sandy Hook in the byline, it went into spam, but then later all the Sandy Hook terms get subpoenaed, and there it is, hidden there.
[00:39:05.983 --> 00:39:08.844]  And then, the other side says we're sending them child porn.
[00:39:10.518 --> 00:39:12.599]  What a comedy of eras.
[00:39:12.599 --> 00:39:31.850]  So we'll talk more about that in a moment and clarify some things, but Norm, the latest here on this, I started hearing about this a few days ago, this is now all over the news, Alex Jones attacks Sandy Hook family lawyer as a quote, little white Jew boy in latest unhinged outburst.
[00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:36.333]  Now it's funny, no one could think that from what I said, we have the court transcript, a government document.
[00:39:38.305 --> 00:39:48.253]  That says, I said, white shoe boy, not once but twice, stereotypical Ivy League student, effeminate or immature, establishment pertaining to mainstream U.S.
[00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:50.034]  social power structures.
[00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:56.339]  I said, if you think you establishment white shoe boys are going to destroy me, think again.
[00:39:56.339 --> 00:39:59.982]  Well, they just turned that by the magic alchemy of fake news into Jew boy!
[00:40:02.472 --> 00:40:04.053]  And we'll play that clip coming up.
[00:40:04.053 --> 00:40:11.060]  But Norm, first they said in the AP that I wrote a book called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook and lost the lawsuit this week.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.041]  Not true.
[00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:12.882]  I never read the book.
[00:40:12.882 --> 00:40:15.484]  Not in the book, I'm told.
[00:40:15.484 --> 00:40:20.128]  And then now this, that I'm calling people Jewboy when I didn't.
[00:40:20.128 --> 00:40:22.270]  And now just everything else.
[00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:24.132]  It's open season fake news.
[00:40:24.132 --> 00:40:26.995]  What do you make of this as a famous constitutional and criminal lawyer?
[00:40:28.439 --> 00:40:30.500]  I don't have to be a lawyer to make sense of it.
[00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.062]  It's just pure hooey.
[00:40:33.062 --> 00:40:34.602]  You could be a half-wit and see it.
[00:40:34.602 --> 00:40:37.444]  Let me tell you something that I don't think you know.
[00:40:37.444 --> 00:40:47.329]  The court transcript that was submitted to Judge Bellis in Connecticut, and that was transcribed by the plaintiff's lawyers, had Jewboy in there.
[00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:50.611]  Now, in the court transcript, rather than Shoeboy.
[00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:54.654]  Now, I was sitting right next to you on the set last Friday when you spoke.
[00:40:54.654 --> 00:40:55.734]  I didn't hear Jewboy.
[00:40:55.734 --> 00:40:57.115]  I heard White Shoeboy.
[00:40:57.948 --> 00:41:03.756]  We had our own transcript done of that proceeding and we hear shoe boy.
[00:41:03.756 --> 00:41:06.179]  And we didn't tell our court reporter what to write.
[00:41:06.179 --> 00:41:07.982]  We just said give us a transcript.
[00:41:07.982 --> 00:41:09.244]  And so there's shoe boy.
[00:41:09.244 --> 00:41:10.585]  They've got you boy.
[00:41:10.585 --> 00:41:12.588]  But I say white shoe boy all the time.
[00:41:12.588 --> 00:41:13.549]  I got that term from.
[00:41:14.668 --> 00:41:17.610]  It's just an example of confirmation bias.
[00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:27.516]  There are people who don't like you, they're determined to get you, and if you say something they can turn against you, they'll turn it, twist it, even get it wrong if it serves their purposes.
[00:41:27.516 --> 00:41:35.640]  So, you know, that's what was tendered to the court, and I'm sure that's what the media is relying upon when they report it.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.441]  You didn't say it.
[00:41:37.154 --> 00:41:39.336]  You weren't referring to Maddie.
[00:41:39.336 --> 00:41:48.282]  It's not a reasonable interpretation of that, but it serves political purposes to make you out to be a threatener and to get those headlines and to drive people away from you.
[00:41:48.282 --> 00:41:57.149]  And as sure as I'm sitting here today in New Haven, Connecticut, they will use that to try to de-platform you further or as an example of hate speech.
[00:41:57.149 --> 00:41:58.550]  And it just wasn't so!
[00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:04.254]  I told you last week, or maybe it was earlier this week, it's been a long week, that
[00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:16.444]  This experience of what has happened to you in the last seven days is my first personal experience with fake news on a national level, and it is stunning to me.
[00:42:16.444 --> 00:42:17.685]  You know, it is stunning to me.
[00:42:17.685 --> 00:42:23.332]  As an ordinary guy who goes about his business in courts from day to day, I don't pay as much attention to the news as I should.
[00:42:24.032 --> 00:42:33.739]  Or as I should, I should say, I hear people talk about fake news but I've never seen it up close and personal and now I have and it stings and it hurts and it makes me angry.
[00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:37.581]  I can't imagine how it makes you feel.
[00:42:37.581 --> 00:42:41.244]  Well, it shows they're desperate and they're upset about nationalism in America waking up.
[00:42:41.244 --> 00:42:41.684]  But guess what?
[00:42:41.684 --> 00:42:44.246]  America's not going back to sleep.
[00:42:44.246 --> 00:42:45.787]  Corporate media is all going bankrupt.
[00:42:46.793 --> 00:42:51.019]  And everyone is exiting the big mega leftist cities.
[00:42:51.019 --> 00:42:53.382]  The exodus is accelerating.
[00:42:53.382 --> 00:42:55.064]  People are running from you like the plague.
[00:42:55.064 --> 00:42:59.570]  We'll be right back with Norm Pattis with the big news.
[00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.073]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics,
[00:43:02.293 --> 00:43:09.424]  I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[00:43:09.424 --> 00:43:17.417]  The false claim that you purposely said kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as
[00:43:17.777 --> 00:43:18.418]  False.
[00:43:18.418 --> 00:43:19.538]  It's a smear.
[00:43:19.538 --> 00:43:21.740]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.201]  You don't even open it.
[00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:28.545]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million documents, and then it's blamed on you.
[00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:30.146]  This is Kafka-esque.
[00:43:30.146 --> 00:43:31.267]  This is bizarre.
[00:43:31.267 --> 00:43:37.691]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kiddie porn, is really outrageous.
[00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:43.155]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[00:43:43.155 --> 00:43:44.696]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[00:43:44.696 --> 00:43:45.877]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[00:43:45.877 --> 00:43:47.258]  Where's Associated Press?
[00:43:47.559 --> 00:43:53.130]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:58.581]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support InfoWars with your dollars.
[00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:04.540]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:14.001]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:18.782]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:04.402]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:46:04.402 --> 00:46:05.463]  They are technocrats.
[00:46:05.463 --> 00:46:07.766]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:46:07.766 --> 00:46:14.635]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions is in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:46:15.196 --> 00:46:16.976]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:46:16.976 --> 00:46:19.437]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:46:19.437 --> 00:46:25.938]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:46:25.938 --> 00:46:31.119]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:40.141]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:46:41.121 --> 00:46:47.106]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.

[00:46:58.076 --> 00:46:59.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.874 --> 00:47:23.535]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:47:23.535 --> 00:47:26.496]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:47:26.496 --> 00:47:29.758]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.758 --> 00:47:34.019]  Very powerful article on Infowars.com.
[00:47:34.019 --> 00:47:37.601]  You were 10 minutes from war, which could have triggered a world war.
[00:47:38.341 --> 00:47:46.286]  Definitely a huge Middle East war with Israel bombing nuclear facilities after Iran would retaliate by firing over 100,000 missiles at them.
[00:47:46.286 --> 00:47:48.788]  That's the default.
[00:47:48.788 --> 00:47:50.309]  A catastrophe.
[00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:52.711]  Trump called it off.
[00:47:52.711 --> 00:47:58.694]  Ten minutes from war, Trump stopped Iran's strike after asking how many would die.
[00:47:58.694 --> 00:48:04.178]  I have confirmed that almost all of his advisors are telling him, massive war.
[00:48:04.178 --> 00:48:05.098]  Trump is saying no.
[00:48:06.324 --> 00:48:12.847]  And that it's been people like Tucker Carlson that are barely able to talk the president out of it.
[00:48:12.847 --> 00:48:13.767]  And I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:48:13.767 --> 00:48:14.868]  But that's coming up next hour.
[00:48:14.868 --> 00:48:16.388]  We'll open the phones up.
[00:48:16.388 --> 00:48:29.634]  Getting back to this, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to play religious or race cards here on air, but everybody knows that I am not anti-Semitic and that the left beats people over the head with that.
[00:48:29.634 --> 00:48:30.895]  They say Trump's anti-Semitic.
[00:48:30.895 --> 00:48:33.376]  It's just preposterous.
[00:48:33.376 --> 00:48:33.956]  President Trump.
[00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:40.438]  My daughter is married an Orthodox Jew, Jared Kushner.
[00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:45.384]  I didn't even think of it as a big deal that my first wife was part Jewish.
[00:48:45.384 --> 00:48:48.088]  Her family was pretty much agnostic.
[00:48:48.088 --> 00:48:51.151]  Her dad was a Christian.
[00:48:54.939 --> 00:48:56.560]  Not Jewish.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.342]  But when the Nazis learned about that, they made it a big deal to say horrible things about my children.
[00:49:01.342 --> 00:49:24.034]  So I don't think it's very funny when the white supremacists are all over the internet calling my children horrible names to have people, then when I clearly said white shoe boy, which means an East Coast, Yale or Harvard white shoe law firm is a term that's heavily used in the Northeast by the regular classes against what they see as the establishment.
[00:49:24.614 --> 00:49:27.735]  And so they knew exactly what they were doing when they did this.
[00:49:27.735 --> 00:49:31.816]  Alex Jones attacks Sandy Hook Family's lawyer as a little white Jew boy.
[00:49:31.816 --> 00:49:38.638]  Plus, Matty, the guy I was talking about in some of the rant, not much of it, that's an Italian name.
[00:49:38.638 --> 00:49:40.679]  Or a French name.
[00:49:40.679 --> 00:49:41.779]  And I knew that before I looked it up.
[00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:43.880]  And I looked it up this morning and it said Italian or French.
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.901]  So, it's just wrong at every level and it shows, folks,
[00:49:48.288 --> 00:49:50.009]  That they'll do anything.
[00:49:50.009 --> 00:49:51.010]  They'll say and do.
[00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:52.151]  They do not care.
[00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:53.011]  It's crazy.
[00:49:53.011 --> 00:50:00.957]  We had our own transcript done, when they played the clip in court, and the separate stenographer says, white shoe boy.
[00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:01.797]  White shoe boy.
[00:50:01.797 --> 00:50:03.318]  White shoe law firms.
[00:50:03.318 --> 00:50:06.941]  So, definitely out to get me in more ways than one.
[00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:12.125]  But the good news is, this came in days ago, but I've been so busy, it just was, you know, put to the side.
[00:50:13.388 --> 00:50:20.695]  And Paul Watson's about to publish an article on this at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:50:20.695 --> 00:50:26.840]  Most people aren't buying the hoax that I sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:29.022]  Why would I just jump off a cliff then?
[00:50:29.022 --> 00:50:30.463]  That's just insane.
[00:50:30.463 --> 00:50:33.005]  No, they wanted 9.6 million emails.
[00:50:33.005 --> 00:50:38.670]  The judge said 57,000, with anything with a Sandy Hook term in it, or a whole bunch of other terms.
[00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.152]  Right at the time I was sued last year,
[00:50:41.323 --> 00:50:43.184]  I was in a press conference in D.C.
[00:50:43.184 --> 00:50:44.626]  about these suits.
[00:50:44.626 --> 00:50:50.090]  I've sent, it turns out, two emails with a couple of attachments.
[00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:54.093]  People saying, here's clips of David Rockefeller hoping I'd open the attachments.
[00:50:54.093 --> 00:50:55.674]  It went to the spam.
[00:50:55.674 --> 00:51:02.379]  We're publishing all the metadata except for the child porn metadata, because you can use that data to recreate it.
[00:51:02.379 --> 00:51:08.024]  We've been told, go ahead and destroy it by the FBI, and so has Pattis, and it confirms his conversation with him last week.
[00:51:08.925 --> 00:51:14.090]  In that conversation, they said that I was the victim.
[00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:17.314]  But you saw thousands of headlines, and I've had friends and family call.
[00:51:17.314 --> 00:51:20.938]  Just this morning, my personal trainer came over to stretch me out and stuff.
[00:51:20.938 --> 00:51:21.798]  Hadn't been over in a few days.
[00:51:21.798 --> 00:51:25.402]  He said, yeah, here's my cousin asking if it's true.
[00:51:25.402 --> 00:51:28.526]  They saw the headline on the news, Alex Jones sent child born.
[00:51:28.526 --> 00:51:30.227]  They said, if it's true, why would he do that?
[00:51:30.227 --> 00:51:31.308]  That's so destructive.
[00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:33.291]  Yeah, no kidding!
[00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:36.695]  If you hear I jump into a wood chipper, don't believe it, I was put in it!
[00:51:36.695 --> 00:51:38.357]  Gosh, man!
[00:51:38.357 --> 00:51:40.280]  It's just unbelievable!
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:49.410]  And so, going back to Norm Pattis, and I appreciate him joining us, the $100,000 reward is out there, a million's too much, so I walked that back, plus I didn't put the reward out right.
[00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.511]  We've done it officially correctly.
[00:51:51.172 --> 00:51:54.195]  We're going to put out the metadata so people can help track this.
[00:51:54.195 --> 00:52:00.901]  It'll obviously be the ISPs that need to help, but we really need to bust this person and their QAnon address that they use.
[00:52:00.901 --> 00:52:06.986]  We don't know if that's really one of the people in QAnon, but that's the perfect part about QAnon is it's a perfect intelligence op.
[00:52:06.986 --> 00:52:10.650]  And so Norm, roll through this and talk about this for viewers.
[00:52:11.232 --> 00:52:14.233]  Well, let me just backtrack a second if it's alright with you.
[00:52:14.233 --> 00:52:24.618]  I'm looking at page 28 of the transcript, the plaintiff's lawyer's, the Sandy Hook case submitted to the court, where you are quoted as saying, he's a white Jew boy that thinks he owns America.
[00:52:24.618 --> 00:52:29.601]  My copy of the transcript is unsigned, so I don't know if they gave a certified copy.
[00:52:30.121 --> 00:52:39.366]  Our copy of the certified transcript which came in after the court hearing says he's a white shoe boy that thinks he owns America.
[00:52:39.366 --> 00:52:43.828]  So I don't know, you know, is it an innocent mistake?
[00:52:43.828 --> 00:52:45.849]  I'm not so sure about that.
[00:52:45.849 --> 00:52:55.293]  Why did we hear white shoe boy and why did your adversaries hear white Jew boy and why is the copy of the transcript that says white Jew boy unsigned?
[00:52:55.293 --> 00:52:57.234]  I'd like to know.
[00:52:57.234 --> 00:52:58.355]  But moving on to the letter.
[00:52:58.959 --> 00:53:01.460]  The letter confirms the discussion that we had.
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.862]  We were promised the letter either last Friday or Monday of this week.
[00:53:04.862 --> 00:53:07.084]  I believe it only arrived on Tuesday.
[00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:11.086]  And what the letter says is that these items were retrieved.
[00:53:11.525 --> 00:53:21.052]  And it gives file names for them, and gives us the opportunity to locate them within the databases we maintain on behalf of this litigation.
[00:53:21.052 --> 00:53:24.275]  But it's interesting to me what we learned.
[00:53:24.275 --> 00:53:30.579]  The file paths were on four of them, and excuse me, they all are Lanza backslash Lanza.
[00:53:30.579 --> 00:53:32.681]  That's the name, obviously, of the Sandy Hook shooter.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:43.421]  E-mails, QAnon at OnionMail.info, and then something called Yimmies, Y-M-M-I-E-S at Yimmies at Dan Wynn, and then there's a number and so forth.
[00:53:45.402 --> 00:53:46.823]  I don't know who sent these.
[00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:53.426]  I really don't know if this is going to be enough of a trail to give you the opportunity to locate the senders.
[00:53:53.426 --> 00:54:06.032]  But it's fake news to suggest that you knew them, what these emails contained, opened them, that knew that they contained explosive and criminally inculpatory material, or even that you sent them to anybody.
[00:54:06.032 --> 00:54:11.055]  I was court-ordered to give over emails that we retrieved by using search terms.
[00:54:11.055 --> 00:54:13.796]  Your computers, your data people,
[00:54:14.296 --> 00:54:15.177]  We're exhausted.
[00:54:15.177 --> 00:54:16.838]  I felt bad when I met some of them.
[00:54:16.838 --> 00:54:24.005]  I thought I'd been a sadist with them because we pressed them to work around the clock for days using search terms.
[00:54:24.005 --> 00:54:32.452]  Now then, in court pleadings, the Sandy Hook lawyers said, well, you know, if the defendants had done minimal due diligence, they would have spotted these and not sent them.
[00:54:32.452 --> 00:54:34.834]  Those lawyers didn't spot them themselves either.
[00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:47.994]  They sent their money, or their data, to a California data processing term, which by means of sophisticated data processing was able to sort through the tens of thousands of emails and just happened to find these.
[00:54:47.994 --> 00:54:55.257]  So, you know, the notion that you are somehow at all responsible for these could not be more false.
[00:54:55.257 --> 00:55:02.379]  And there is not a courtroom or a place where I can go under the oath, under oath, that I will refuse to go to assert this.
[00:55:02.379 --> 00:55:04.340]  You did not send these.
[00:55:05.325 --> 00:55:10.471]  There is not a shred of evidence to suggest you knew that anybody sent them on your behalf.
[00:55:10.471 --> 00:55:14.756]  There is not a shred of evidence that even the Koskoff lawyers could figure out what they were.
[00:55:14.756 --> 00:55:18.220]  They spent whatever it was to have somebody troll through this.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:25.008]  You didn't spend the $100,000 that it would have taken for somebody to run through it and troll through every bit of metadata.
[00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:27.332]  Because you're the one who's being sued.
[00:55:27.332 --> 00:55:28.553]  They've invested.
[00:55:28.553 --> 00:55:33.297]  And by the way, we've already spent a lot of money just going through the nine million emails and fighting to turn them all over.
[00:55:33.297 --> 00:55:38.542]  And I remember when the Costco people were in court asking to have the judge order us to open all attachments.
[00:55:38.542 --> 00:55:41.684]  You can't even do that under law if you don't know what attachments are.
[00:55:41.684 --> 00:55:45.708]  I mean, we would then go to prison if we would have opened these potentially.
[00:55:45.708 --> 00:55:47.189]  It's just we need relief from this.
[00:55:47.189 --> 00:55:52.454]  I need you to go to a special hearing with the judge about who didn't sign the transcript to put the fake thing on the transcript.
[00:55:53.074 --> 00:55:54.015]  First of all, I don't know.
[00:55:54.015 --> 00:55:57.559]  It may be that we were just given a copy and the signed copy was filed in court.
[00:55:57.559 --> 00:56:02.664]  To be honest with you, I only noticed this this morning as we were preparing for the show.
[00:56:02.664 --> 00:56:03.965]  Well, it needs to be fixed.
[00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:04.686]  Can't we have a hearing?
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:06.641]  I don't know if we can have a hearing.
[00:56:06.641 --> 00:56:14.087]  We're going to be in the State Supreme Court Monday filing papers and we will file a certified transcript with it and we'll make note of this error.
[00:56:14.087 --> 00:56:16.749]  It's by far, it's not an innocent error.
[00:56:16.749 --> 00:56:27.757]  I mean, as an example of how loaded these terms are, a press organization contacted me, a legal publication about this dispute and about Koskoff's claims that we should have known we sent them to you.
[00:56:27.757 --> 00:56:32.221]  And I wrote, as I typically do when I don't have a lot of time, my response rather than answer the phone call.
[00:56:33.122 --> 00:56:36.898]  Unlike Koskoff, Koskoff, and Bieter, Mr. Jones does not weigh his money.
[00:56:37.566 --> 00:56:38.807]  Now, I get a pushback.
[00:56:38.807 --> 00:56:39.888]  That's anti-Semitic.
[00:56:39.888 --> 00:56:41.408]  I said, what do you mean it's anti-Semitic?
[00:56:41.408 --> 00:56:45.071]  Everybody talks about people who are loaded, weighing, rather than counting their money.
[00:56:45.071 --> 00:56:51.115]  Well, Koskoff, Koskoff, and Bieter, those could be Jewish names, and you're talking about money in association with Jewish names, and yadda yadda yadda.
[00:56:51.115 --> 00:56:53.076]  I said, I stand by my comments.
[00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:56.518]  Now, it's been too busy a week here for me to know whether they printed it or not.
[00:56:56.518 --> 00:56:57.999]  But it's pure alchemy.
[00:56:57.999 --> 00:57:01.161]  They just turn everything into something racial.
[00:57:01.161 --> 00:57:05.684]  It's like AOC saying cauliflower is racist because it's white.
[00:57:06.283 --> 00:57:13.551]  In an era of identity politics, if you have an aggrieved identity, you think you own the English language and can tell the rest of us how to use it.
[00:57:13.551 --> 00:57:20.179]  Intentions used to matter, but now the hurt feelings of the aggrieved do, and we're driving ourselves crazy and into the ground with this nonsense.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:37.404]  Stay there, I want to come back with a clarification to this Chris Maddy individual and the judge and all the rest of this because I didn't say Jubal and everybody knows it and I didn't threaten Maddy and everybody knows it and then the media runs around saying it like it's all true so it must be true.
[00:57:37.404 --> 00:57:44.146]  So I want to make again a very clear clarification like we did on Saturday and like we did on Friday that they ignore.
[00:57:44.146 --> 00:57:48.147]  I want to make this totally clear because they're representing things that are not correct.
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:58:02.056]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[00:58:02.056 --> 00:58:04.980]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.000]  I don't know.
[00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:25.730]  I like to be expanding.
[00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:26.491]  I like to be winning.
[00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:27.211]  I like to be fighting.
[00:58:27.211 --> 00:58:28.411]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[00:58:28.411 --> 00:58:29.292]  That's why we're so hated.
[00:58:29.292 --> 00:58:30.912]  But we need to be retreaded.
[00:58:30.912 --> 00:58:32.092]  We need to be tuned up.
[00:58:32.092 --> 00:58:33.173]  We need to be fixed up.
[00:58:33.173 --> 00:58:34.493]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[00:58:34.493 --> 00:58:36.034]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[00:58:36.034 --> 00:58:40.875]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:42.876]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[00:58:42.876 --> 00:58:45.717]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[00:58:45.717 --> 00:58:47.497]  Funded by foreign banks and the Chai Com show.
[00:58:47.497 --> 00:58:48.798]  Go to InfowarStore.com.
[00:58:51.408 --> 00:58:58.816]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:58:58.816 --> 00:59:06.805]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:59:12.452 --> 00:59:14.172]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:59:14.172 --> 00:59:15.393]  This is racketeering.
[00:59:15.393 --> 00:59:16.513]  This is cartels.
[00:59:16.513 --> 00:59:18.914]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:59:18.914 --> 00:59:20.794]  We need it now.
[00:59:20.794 --> 00:59:22.494]  You can take on Big Ted.
[00:59:22.494 --> 00:59:31.417]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:59:31.417 --> 00:59:39.479]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:59:39.479 --> 00:59:40.319]  The way to fight back
[00:59:40.919 --> 00:59:42.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:07.354]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:16.342]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.342 --> 01:00:24.549]  Alright, final segment with Norm Hattis.
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.321]  I want to make one more point on the white shoe boy situation.
[01:00:28.321 --> 01:00:34.223]  I want to show how on target my use of the English language in terms is from time to time.
[01:00:34.223 --> 01:00:35.804]  Sometimes I butcher it.
[01:00:35.804 --> 01:00:37.785]  But I said white shoe boy.
[01:00:37.785 --> 01:00:44.547]  White shoe boy means stereotypical Ivy League effeminate or immature establishment pertaining to mainstream U.S.
[01:00:44.547 --> 01:00:45.168]  social power.
[01:00:45.168 --> 01:00:46.168]  That's definitions.
[01:00:49.156 --> 01:00:52.398]  And of course, we've got countless others that show that.
[01:00:52.398 --> 01:00:55.059]  White shoe, or white shoe law firm.
[01:00:55.059 --> 01:00:57.240]  This is from Wikipedia.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:04.044]  The phrase comes from white buck lace suede buckskin shoes for the Red Soul, long popular at Ivy League colleges.
[01:01:05.664 --> 01:01:15.206]  A 1953 Esquire article describes social strata at Yale University explains that white shoe applies primarily to the socially ambitious and the socially smug types.
[01:01:15.206 --> 01:01:17.387]  It is pertaining to Yale.
[01:01:17.387 --> 01:01:19.287]  So a lot of these guys are Yale graduates.
[01:01:19.287 --> 01:01:21.868]  They're there in Connecticut next door to Yale.
[01:01:21.868 --> 01:01:23.868]  The courthouse is down the street from Yale.
[01:01:23.868 --> 01:01:31.870]  I gave the exact naming to show off my understanding of rhetorical
[01:01:33.229 --> 01:01:35.210]  Lexicons.
[01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:38.573]  And that gets transmuted into Jew.
[01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:45.177]  Oh, sorry, it also goes on an Esquire to say WASP.
[01:01:45.177 --> 01:01:46.018]  That's right.
[01:01:46.018 --> 01:01:52.142]  Members of the White Elite.
[01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.182]  WASP.
[01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:55.584]  White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
[01:01:55.584 --> 01:02:01.708]  White Anglo-Saxon Protestant now turns into Jew in the magical courtroom.
[01:02:03.399 --> 01:02:05.802]  Wow, thanks a lot, Connecticut.
[01:02:05.802 --> 01:02:07.964]  Wow, thanks a lot.
[01:02:07.964 --> 01:02:10.747]  You're really the good guys, aren't you, up there, liberals?
[01:02:10.747 --> 01:02:18.574]  Norm, I want to finish up, and we may have to go a little bit in the next segment on this, but let's do a few more minutes in the next segment, because I want to just be totally clear on this Manny thing.
[01:02:20.621 --> 01:02:23.063]  What do you make of the magnitude of this alchemy?
[01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:29.469]  Because we could play the clip here, where I'm yelling and getting upset and saying, you white shoe boys think you know it all.
[01:02:29.469 --> 01:02:31.010]  I mean, that's so clear what I said.
[01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:33.292]  And everybody I know in Connecticut knows that term.
[01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:34.073]  It's where it comes from.
[01:02:34.073 --> 01:02:34.774]  What do you make of this?
[01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:43.261]  When you say, if you were to belch, they'd call the Environmental Protection Agency and make an air pollution complaint.
[01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:48.585]  There are plenty of people up here for whom you are toxic, but understand there's a growing number who aren't.
[01:02:48.585 --> 01:03:00.172]  After we argued the other day against sanctions for you, one of the marshals came up to me the next day I was in court on trial on another matter and said, you know, I agreed with everything you said on behalf of Mr. Jones in that courtroom.
[01:03:00.172 --> 01:03:01.153]  The judge was wrong.
[01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:02.914]  That was from a marshal in the courthouse.
[01:03:03.734 --> 01:03:08.918]  I have people, I was on the radio on him, the Vinnie Penn Show, a local journalist you've interviewed with him.
[01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:16.003]  We were talking about what's going on and he said, you know, we're still talking about the Sandy Hook kids seven years later.
[01:03:16.003 --> 01:03:17.985]  I said, well one of the concerns Mr. Jones has
[01:03:18.565 --> 01:03:22.927]  Is that other people are using this tragedy to advance their own agendas.
[01:03:22.927 --> 01:03:34.392]  It's no mystery to us that the Sandy Hook complaint was filed more than five years after most of the utterances and only after Hillary Clinton lost an election in which you were believed to have played a pivotal role.
[01:03:34.392 --> 01:03:37.394]  So the case has become a political hot potato.
[01:03:37.394 --> 01:03:42.396]  The children of Sandy Hook and their families are now pawns in a game that long since ended.
[01:03:43.116 --> 01:03:44.037]  I don't know.
[01:04:02.478 --> 01:04:09.005]  Exactly, and then they end up in a child porn and saying, Jew boy, none of this is true.
[01:04:09.005 --> 01:04:15.953]  And it's just crazy how mainstream media lies like this and how they've got all these different angles that come out of it.
[01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:17.054]  It just never seems to end.
[01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:19.296]  This is why media is not trusted.
[01:04:19.296 --> 01:04:20.718]  This is why they're hated.
[01:04:21.178 --> 01:04:21.699]  It's shocking.
[01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:22.720]  I mean, people don't get it.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.281]  That's what I told the judge in court the other day.
[01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:26.684]  I said, you know, Alex Jones didn't create his listeners.
[01:04:26.684 --> 01:04:29.907]  People listen to Alex Jones because there's a legitimacy crisis in this country.
[01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:32.710]  There's a fundamental lack of trust in big institutions.
[01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:35.974]  And it's reporting like this and distortions like this that create the trust.
[01:04:36.854 --> 01:04:41.356]  Whether we agree with you or whether you and I agree on every issue or not, it doesn't really matter.
[01:04:41.356 --> 01:04:42.677]  Your right to speak does.
[01:04:42.677 --> 01:04:48.199]  And when people resort to mistruths, lies, to try to silence you, that terrifies me.
[01:04:48.199 --> 01:04:48.639]  You're right.
[01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:52.301]  Let's finish up on the other side and get into the big war news, which is huge.
[01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:53.161]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:54.521]  Infowars.com.
[01:04:54.521 --> 01:04:55.442]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:03.895]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:05:03.895 --> 01:05:07.076]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:05:07.076 --> 01:05:10.237]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:22.440]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.602]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[01:05:27.602 --> 01:05:28.842]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[01:05:28.882 --> 01:05:30.223]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:13.944]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:21.238 --> 01:06:22.419]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:22.419 --> 01:06:30.122]  We're into hour number two on this Friday, June 21st, 2019, Global Transmission.
[01:06:30.122 --> 01:06:33.804]  We came within 10 minutes of launching a new war in the Middle East.
[01:06:33.804 --> 01:06:41.027]  Over 100,000 missiles Israel would have faced, along with Saudi Arabia, that would have been rained down on them by Iran.
[01:06:41.027 --> 01:06:43.308]  But in the last minute, Trump said no.
[01:06:43.308 --> 01:06:45.629]  Next segment, we'll give you the inside baseball on why that happened.
[01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.030]  Why it's so important?
[01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:51.593]  Because the same neocons and leftists are pushing for war as we speak.
[01:06:51.593 --> 01:06:58.378]  The Democratic Party now officially in national polls sees war as anti-Trump because Trump is seen as anti-war.
[01:06:58.378 --> 01:07:09.427]  And now Democrats in Gallup polls, 57 percent, that's the latest, the one a month ago was 54 percent, want war, period, and want us to stay in over 120 nations.
[01:07:11.974 --> 01:07:13.895]  Total and complete madness.
[01:07:32.922 --> 01:07:34.664]  Some of the biggest cases out there.
[01:07:34.664 --> 01:07:38.328]  Just did a big one, a big divorce case with a Russian oligarch and his wife.
[01:07:38.328 --> 01:07:40.691]  Did another big murder case in Connecticut.
[01:07:40.691 --> 01:07:44.154]  But he's done some of the biggest First Amendment cases in the country.
[01:07:44.154 --> 01:07:46.817]  And he's seen the dangerous trend towards destroying it.
[01:07:46.817 --> 01:07:49.120]  So recapping what we covered in just the next few minutes.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:49.680]  We'll let you go.
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.121]  You're busy.
[01:07:51.089 --> 01:07:54.230]  On the other info we didn't get into, and why this is so serious.
[01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.271]  Again, this is not about Alex Jones, folks.
[01:07:56.271 --> 01:08:00.333]  This is a premeditated move to end free speech.
[01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:07.855]  And the Democratic Party law firm, biggest in Connecticut, that's also suing me, is suing, pushing reparations.
[01:08:07.855 --> 01:08:16.359]  And suing Harvard, trying to get the first photos ever of slaves taken from Harvard and given to the descendants.
[01:08:17.179 --> 01:08:20.101]  So, uh, I mean, these guys are really undermining the system.
[01:08:20.101 --> 01:08:24.984]  They're the ones that bankrupted, uh, Smith & Wesson, our oldest gun company.
[01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:27.006]  Won't be able to get those firearms soon.
[01:08:27.006 --> 01:08:28.166]  Our military uses them.
[01:08:28.166 --> 01:08:30.088]  The .308 Remington 700.
[01:08:30.088 --> 01:08:31.689]  What a sweet shooting gun.
[01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:36.852]  My son's got a couple of them, so do I. I've shot deer at a thousand yards with them.
[01:08:36.852 --> 01:08:38.673]  Like, take a candy from a baby.
[01:08:38.673 --> 01:08:39.154]  Gone.
[01:08:39.154 --> 01:08:39.794]  Bankrupt.
[01:08:39.794 --> 01:08:40.475]  Over.
[01:08:40.475 --> 01:08:46.058]  So, we, I have the system coming after me, but I want to clarify something.
[01:08:46.058 --> 01:08:46.459]  Friday,
[01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:50.361]  I had gotten a lot of really rough family news.
[01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:51.922]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:08:51.922 --> 01:08:56.345]  And I had also had a French TV crew here that said they were coming about the First Amendment.
[01:08:56.345 --> 01:08:58.206]  It was really about Sandy Hook.
[01:08:58.206 --> 01:09:00.448]  And so I was already pissed off.
[01:09:00.448 --> 01:09:07.392]  And about once a year, I will almost have like a Tourette's syndrome type event before the news runs with Jones diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome.
[01:09:07.392 --> 01:09:09.674]  That's a turn of the phrase.
[01:09:09.674 --> 01:09:10.895]  That's hyperbole.
[01:09:10.895 --> 01:09:17.199]  Like when I said a deposition, I almost have a form of I would say the public collective
[01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:26.285]  Well, I guess the term would be psychosis, in that when you get lied to so much, people believe that the Earth is flat.
[01:09:26.285 --> 01:09:33.127]  I don't believe that, but because they've been lied to so much, a lot of people believe the Earth is flat now.
[01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:37.589]  Now, I believe that's totally wrong, but it's a collective psychosis when you've been lied to.
[01:09:37.589 --> 01:09:42.171]  Almost no one believed, last week, that the Iranians really attacked those ships.
[01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:45.752]  I said they might have done it, because they said, we may sink them with a straight-over moose.
[01:09:45.752 --> 01:09:46.973]  They sure shot down that drone!
[01:09:48.004 --> 01:09:52.126]  Now it didn't mean I want war, it didn't mean I'm pushing a war, I said it could really be them!
[01:09:52.126 --> 01:09:55.488]  My listeners got really mad at me!
[01:09:55.488 --> 01:09:59.290]  Because people now don't buy anything because they've been lied to so much.
[01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:01.371]  So they spun that.
[01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:06.193]  But I legitimately got angry on air.
[01:10:06.193 --> 01:10:11.816]  And I'm not going to sit there and watch the corporate news and all the rest of them with their latest lies that we'll recap in a moment.
[01:10:12.975 --> 01:10:18.837]  Say I lost a suit this week for a book I didn't write, a book I've never read called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook.
[01:10:18.837 --> 01:10:20.558]  Did no such thing.
[01:10:20.558 --> 01:10:21.718]  People have a right to write that book.
[01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:27.140]  I don't think they should have, you know, they basically just didn't fight it and let them win the case.
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.220]  I'm not in the book.
[01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:29.020]  I've not read the book.
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:30.301]  I'm told I'm not in it.
[01:10:30.301 --> 01:10:31.441]  That's a total hoax.
[01:10:31.441 --> 01:10:32.622]  Ultimate fake news.
[01:10:32.622 --> 01:10:33.942]  Top of Yahoo.
[01:10:33.942 --> 01:10:35.423]  Top of AP.
[01:10:35.423 --> 01:10:37.923]  Top of Twitter for days.
[01:10:37.923 --> 01:10:39.404]  Ultimate fake news psyop.
[01:10:39.404 --> 01:10:42.165]  MSN falsely claims Alex Jones loses Sandy Hook defamation case.
[01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:44.793]  Totally insane.
[01:10:44.793 --> 01:10:46.093]  That's on newshorse.com.
[01:10:46.093 --> 01:10:48.955]  And we've had lawyers sending them letters and calling them for days.
[01:10:48.955 --> 01:10:50.595]  They just go, we're leaving it up!
[01:10:50.595 --> 01:10:51.256]  Okay?
[01:10:51.256 --> 01:10:52.616]  Doesn't matter you're not on the book.
[01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:53.977]  We're just going to say it.
[01:10:53.977 --> 01:10:56.338]  Because it creates the illusion that I'm this criminal and I'm losing.
[01:10:57.429 --> 01:11:04.071]  So, some big event can happen, I think, coming soon, unfortunately, for me, but it just shows how desperate the enemy is.
[01:11:04.071 --> 01:11:07.311]  They then put out all over the news that I threatened Chris Maddy.
[01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:07.852]  No, I didn't.
[01:11:07.852 --> 01:11:10.572]  That was not my intent, and I didn't do it.
[01:11:10.572 --> 01:11:23.935]  I said, I'm mad at you guys making me spend hundreds of thousands of dollars going through six, no, nine million emails, 9.6 million emails, and then running to the FBI, because we later learned, going, oh, look, this is criminal, this is criminal.
[01:11:23.935 --> 01:11:25.916]  The FBI said, no, Alex is a victim.
[01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:28.494]  That's what I'm mad about.
[01:11:28.494 --> 01:11:29.976]  This happens to everybody that's in the media.
[01:11:29.976 --> 01:11:31.116]  They get sent this crap.
[01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:32.878]  We didn't know, but it went to spam.
[01:11:32.878 --> 01:11:34.679]  Not that I'm going to put your head on a pike.
[01:11:34.679 --> 01:11:36.781]  I said, we're going to put out this big reward.
[01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:39.463]  We're going to catch who's done it, and their head's going to get put on a pike.
[01:11:39.463 --> 01:11:40.704]  That's figurative.
[01:11:40.704 --> 01:11:44.206]  And I said, whoever you are that did this, that's not Chris Manning.
[01:11:44.206 --> 01:11:45.627]  I don't think Chris Manning would do that.
[01:11:46.658 --> 01:11:49.781]  Any more than I would send child porn to the San Diego family.
[01:11:49.781 --> 01:11:51.983]  And no one sent that to them.
[01:11:51.983 --> 01:11:58.508]  Law firms going through raw emails that had hidden attachments sent it to lawyers, not to the families.
[01:11:58.508 --> 01:12:00.530]  So it's lie upon lie upon lie.
[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:04.894]  And that's what I'm angry about, is just the years of this crap.
[01:12:04.894 --> 01:12:06.355]  And now the Jewboy thing.
[01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:10.379]  When I said, you white shoeboys from Yale, that means Yale.
[01:12:10.379 --> 01:12:12.661]  You're in the town with Yale.
[01:12:13.919 --> 01:12:19.865]  The establishment at Yale, or whoever's running things in that town, stop lying about me.
[01:12:19.865 --> 01:12:21.908]  You go, oh, we'll just say Jew boy.
[01:12:21.908 --> 01:12:23.710]  We'll just keep doubling down.
[01:12:23.710 --> 01:12:25.471]  That's why you're not trusted.
[01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:27.093]  It's why you're not liked.
[01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:29.035]  It's why you're hated.
[01:12:29.035 --> 01:12:31.037]  But do not build up your
[01:12:32.156 --> 01:12:36.478]  Ambulance chaser type, you know, reputation that I'm threatening you.
[01:12:36.478 --> 01:12:38.319]  I would never want you to be a martyr.
[01:12:38.319 --> 01:12:39.560]  Never want you to get hurt.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.961]  I don't want anyone to hurt you.
[01:12:40.961 --> 01:12:42.421]  I would never do that.
[01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:43.422]  And you know that.
[01:12:43.422 --> 01:12:44.843]  I didn't say Jew boy.
[01:12:44.843 --> 01:12:46.544]  I didn't say I want you hurt.
[01:12:46.544 --> 01:12:48.625]  I didn't send the family's child porn.
[01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:49.485]  Damn it.
[01:12:49.485 --> 01:12:50.886]  I'm the victim.
[01:12:50.886 --> 01:12:51.906]  And my crew's the victim.
[01:12:51.906 --> 01:12:55.728]  I've had two people put over this crap!
[01:12:55.728 --> 01:12:57.149]  Excuse me, I'm getting mad again, Norm.
[01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:58.410]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:58.410 --> 01:12:58.950]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:00.511]  Just go ahead and fill folks in here briefly.
[01:13:00.996 --> 01:13:08.358]  I was present in the studio when Hurricane Alex last hit, and I kept my chair but briefly, and I'm holding on to the armrest here in Connecticut.
[01:13:08.358 --> 01:13:09.318]  Take a deep breath.
[01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.379]  I'll sort this out for you.
[01:13:11.379 --> 01:13:15.860]  There's no question in my mind that you did not threaten Chris Maddy.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.981]  You were frustrated, you were emotive, you were out of control.
[01:13:19.981 --> 01:13:25.882]  But that's a long way from a threat, and if ever a person had a reason to lose control, it was you.
[01:13:25.882 --> 01:13:27.403]  And this week it's even worse.
[01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.843]  I mean, Jewboy?
[01:13:28.843 --> 01:13:29.103]  Threat?
[01:13:29.603 --> 01:13:30.584]  Child porn?
[01:13:30.584 --> 01:13:38.727]  I mean, the next thing you know, you're going to be blamed for shooting down the drone in Iran.
[01:13:38.727 --> 01:13:42.489]  I mean, at some point, you stop being a scapegoat and you start being an ordinary American.
[01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:47.392]  And maybe that's what your new brand should be, rather than Alex Jones Conspiracy Theorist.
[01:13:47.392 --> 01:13:49.933]  It's Alex Jones Ordinary American.
[01:13:49.933 --> 01:13:52.314]  He's mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore.
[01:13:52.314 --> 01:13:54.635]  And when he gets mad, everybody gets scared.
[01:13:54.635 --> 01:13:56.056]  That's not hate speech.
[01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:57.076]  That's fear speaking.
[01:13:57.076 --> 01:13:58.237]  And I'm proud to stand next to you.
[01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:02.739]  Well, I don't even know who Chris Maddy is, other than... Well, just leave him aside.
[01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:11.104]  Well, I'm saying, I wish that guy no harm, and I don't want him any harm, and I'm sick of the media running around, acting like I'm threatening him to make people more of a victim.
[01:14:11.104 --> 01:14:16.087]  Just like they say that I say nobody died at Sandy Hook, to reopen the wounds in my name.
[01:14:16.087 --> 01:14:18.849]  And then it's the same thing, always in my name, and they're the ones doing it.
[01:14:18.849 --> 01:14:24.432]  But Alex, Alex, don't let yourself be a bit player in the crisis acting that the lawyers are doing on the other side.
[01:14:24.432 --> 01:14:28.154]  Let's focus on the First Amendment, and let's focus on what ordinary Americans care about.
[01:14:28.314 --> 01:14:29.214]  No, I totally agree.
[01:14:29.214 --> 01:14:35.677]  Just hearing him getting mad again... Most people are suspicious of plaintiff's lawyers, you know, and this is one of the reasons they are.
[01:14:35.677 --> 01:14:36.798]  Anything for a buck.
[01:14:36.798 --> 01:14:38.078]  Alright?
[01:14:38.078 --> 01:14:40.999]  Well, listen, Norm, I appreciate you and I appreciate the fine work you're doing.
[01:14:40.999 --> 01:14:42.500]  We're going to the Supreme Court, aren't we?
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.002]  We're going to the courts next week to try to overturn this latest ruling.
[01:14:46.002 --> 01:14:48.183]  Monday, we'll be filing sometime Monday morning.
[01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:51.344]  In fact, somebody's just walking in right now, handing me a draft of the brief.
[01:14:52.463 --> 01:14:57.366]  We're going to be tidying it up over the weekend and marching into court Monday morning saying, how about a little justice?
[01:14:57.366 --> 01:14:59.387]  Or did we forget about that along the way?
[01:14:59.387 --> 01:15:00.847]  But we've sacrificed truth.
[01:15:00.847 --> 01:15:03.248]  We've sacrificed the American way.
[01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:06.290]  Let's hope the courts aren't immune to claims for justice.
[01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:07.070]  And let's be clear.
[01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.291]  I did not lose a lawsuit.
[01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:13.293]  I did not write a book that Jim Fetzer wrote where they said I lost a lawsuit in AP.
[01:15:13.293 --> 01:15:21.397]  This judge ruled at the preliminary level to not throw out the lawsuit against me, saying because of things I said on air.
[01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:46.989]  Let me tell you, let me read you the first, oh no I can't read you the first line of this draft, never mind, but among the things that we'll be saying next week and what would otherwise be a stunning display of contempt for time honored, well settled jurisprudence surrounding the First Amendment, the trial court joined forces once again to silence a critic of blah blah blah blah, and we'll tune it up and have it filed on Monday and I'll get you a copy as soon as we file it.
[01:15:46.989 --> 01:15:51.151]  Alright, Norm Padish, top lawyer, let you get back to your work, counselor, thank you.
[01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:52.072]  Objection.
[01:15:52.072 --> 01:15:52.693]  See you later.
[01:15:52.693 --> 01:15:53.334]  Bye.
[01:15:53.334 --> 01:15:55.497]  We're going to turn back, ladies and gentlemen, to World War 4.
[01:15:57.504 --> 01:15:58.765]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.765 --> 01:16:00.046]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.046 --> 01:16:03.789]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.789 --> 01:16:04.870]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:06.711]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.711 --> 01:16:08.413]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:16.219 --> 01:16:17.220]  Bold statement?

[01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:33.362]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.362 --> 01:16:36.404]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:42.328]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.328 --> 01:16:46.131]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.131 --> 01:16:47.391]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.391 --> 01:16:48.732]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.732 --> 01:16:54.937]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.937 --> 01:16:56.358]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:59.232]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.232 --> 01:17:04.557]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.557 --> 01:17:06.139]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.139 --> 01:17:14.487]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.487 --> 01:17:20.173]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:20.854]  I don't know.

[01:18:02.285 --> 01:18:08.008]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:18:08.008 --> 01:18:15.893]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:18:15.893 --> 01:18:19.235]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:18:19.235 --> 01:18:26.979]  A unique, natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:18:27.279 --> 01:18:36.426]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:18:36.426 --> 01:18:48.295]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, paldarco bark, and grapeseed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:53.099]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved MycoZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:53.099 --> 01:18:54.780]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:18:58.462 --> 01:19:14.372]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:19:14.372 --> 01:19:16.093]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:19:16.093 --> 01:19:26.979]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.160]  We're good to go.
[01:19:47.108 --> 01:19:49.189]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:20.004 --> 01:20:30.887]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.887 --> 01:20:46.170]  Alright, I really do want to stop talking about myself, but we've been ganged up on, and they're trying to destroy us, and if we don't fight back, we're going to be gone.
[01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.051]  It's like them saying, Trump said, all Mexicans are criminals and bad people.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:53.101]  He said they've got a lot of very fine people coming to this nation.
[01:20:53.101 --> 01:20:58.344]  And they're coming on work visas at my hotels and casinos and golf courses, and they're wonderful people.
[01:20:58.344 --> 01:21:02.326]  We've also got a lot of really, really bad, horrible people coming in who are criminals.
[01:21:02.326 --> 01:21:03.806]  Who are fleeing justice.
[01:21:03.806 --> 01:21:07.588]  That's not all Mexicans are bad.
[01:21:07.588 --> 01:21:09.509]  It's asinine.
[01:21:09.509 --> 01:21:11.330]  It's insane.
[01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.151]  And it's the same thing they do to me.
[01:21:13.151 --> 01:21:17.173]  The good news is, Raw Story has retracted.
[01:21:17.173 --> 01:21:19.174]  This is something that we don't see anymore.
[01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:19.694]  This is good.
[01:21:21.664 --> 01:21:35.147]  Alex Jones, ladies and gentlemen, attacked Sandy Hook Family's lawyer as Little White Shoe Boy in latest unhinged tirade.
[01:21:35.147 --> 01:21:44.589]  And here is the original article that I have a screenshot of, that I have a print off of, where it said, Shoe Boy.
[01:21:44.589 --> 01:21:46.429]  And we've got the clip queued up.
[01:21:47.483 --> 01:21:52.784]  Where I was ranting angry last Friday and clearly I'm not saying Jew boy.
[01:21:52.784 --> 01:21:58.066]  Why in the hell would I mail, email child porn to the Sandy Hook families?
[01:21:58.066 --> 01:22:00.206]  Again, why not jump off a cliff?
[01:22:00.206 --> 01:22:09.888]  Why would I get up here on air and say Jew boy when I've never been against Jews and I get persecuted because I'm not against Jews?
[01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:12.009]  It's just absolutely
[01:22:13.089 --> 01:22:16.011]  Ridiculous, but I'm gonna get into the Iran stuff.
[01:22:16.011 --> 01:22:18.112]  It's really our top story and all this other news next segment.
[01:22:18.112 --> 01:22:28.479]  I just had to get to this because the lies are getting so intense that I don't feel sorry for myself, but I really worry about the country.
[01:22:28.479 --> 01:22:33.442]  Because the media used to lie a lot, but mainly on politics.
[01:22:33.442 --> 01:22:38.545]  Normally if they said something like a plane crashed or there was a tornado here, you could believe it.
[01:22:38.545 --> 01:22:42.308]  Sometimes they lie about stuff like that now where I don't even, it's very frustrating.
[01:22:43.373 --> 01:22:57.378]  We've really gotten to a bad point, but I'm glad that Raw Story, who did run the fake news and is on the list to get sued, by the way, who we sent retraction letters to, where they said that I sent child porn to the families.
[01:22:57.378 --> 01:22:58.479]  No, I didn't.
[01:22:58.479 --> 01:23:04.381]  Somebody sent us hidden images buried in stuff about David Rockefeller.
[01:23:05.626 --> 01:23:16.511]  Right after I got sued by the Sandy Hook families, and it was never opened, and they subpoenaed it and found hidden metadata, hidden child porn, hidden code!
[01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:21.233]  I can't go through 9.6 million emails, nobody can!
[01:23:21.233 --> 01:23:27.916]  And again, I'm angry that we spent trying to not send them anything that was private that would hurt any listeners.
[01:23:29.153 --> 01:23:34.376]  In court battles, like five or six of them, just that level, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:37.078]  That was like $150,000 total.
[01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:42.001]  And then another processing things and computer stuff.
[01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:47.004]  And two people quit because they were working 18 hours a day and just said, I can't handle this.
[01:23:47.004 --> 01:23:49.105]  We lost two of our IT people over this.
[01:23:49.105 --> 01:23:50.846]  That's why I'm angry.
[01:23:50.846 --> 01:23:57.450]  And then you get all the material and you stand it with some fancy pants California thing and go, oh, look, he's got child porn.
[01:23:58.766 --> 01:24:00.166]  See, I'm not going to blow up again.
[01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:04.808]  Just getting framed by the process pisses me off.
[01:24:04.808 --> 01:24:07.489]  I don't think those lawyers sent us the child porn.
[01:24:07.489 --> 01:24:08.829]  I never said that.
[01:24:08.829 --> 01:24:12.571]  But they know damn well when they frame this stuff up with the media what they're doing.
[01:24:12.571 --> 01:24:16.092]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:24:16.092 --> 01:24:19.793]  I just want justice and I'm a good guy and I'm not a criminal.
[01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:21.774]  I don't even speed anymore.
[01:24:21.774 --> 01:24:24.275]  I used to drive fast at night when nobody was around.
[01:24:25.131 --> 01:24:33.337]  But my work is so important now that it's been years since I drove 100 miles an hour.
[01:24:33.337 --> 01:24:34.597]  I like to drive fast.
[01:24:34.597 --> 01:24:35.718]  I like to get on the open road.
[01:24:35.718 --> 01:24:38.340]  I like to go 150 miles an hour.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.822]  And if I ever get out in Death Valley or something, I'll do it again.
[01:24:41.633 --> 01:24:45.114]  Where it's safe, or Montana, where it's a 100 mile an hour speed limit.
[01:24:45.114 --> 01:24:48.775]  But, it's just, I'm Mr. Goody Two Shoes.
[01:24:48.775 --> 01:24:59.197]  I pay all the garbage taxes, I do everything I'm supposed to do, I take care of little old ladies, I give money to charity, and I've got all this scum constantly saying I'm a bad person.
[01:24:59.197 --> 01:25:00.938]  No, I'm a good person!
[01:25:00.938 --> 01:25:02.678]  You globalists are the bad people!
[01:25:02.678 --> 01:25:06.119]  And no matter how long you try to paint me up as the bad guy, America knows the truth.
[01:25:07.332 --> 01:25:08.193]  Enough about that.
[01:25:08.193 --> 01:25:12.799]  Let's play the white shoe boy comment which means elites from Yale.
[01:25:12.799 --> 01:25:14.060]  That's who these people are.
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.362]  Here it is.
[01:25:15.362 --> 01:25:16.523]  You are not a suspect.
[01:25:16.523 --> 01:25:17.385]  You are not a target.
[01:25:17.385 --> 01:25:18.726]  You are not a person of interest.
[01:25:18.726 --> 01:25:20.849]  You are a victim and that's the story here.
[01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.090]  I wonder who the person of interest is.
[01:25:24.047 --> 01:25:26.588]  Look, you're showing Chris Maddy's photograph on here.
[01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:28.509]  Oh no, that was an existential cut.
[01:25:28.509 --> 01:25:30.189]  He's a nice Obama boy.
[01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:30.949]  He's a good guy.
[01:25:30.949 --> 01:25:40.972]  Chris Maddy is your adversary in this litigation just as I am the adversary of the people that have sued you and it is my responsibility to take their case apart if I can and he will attack you.
[01:25:40.972 --> 01:25:43.033]  He's a white shoe boy that thinks he owns America.
[01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:47.121]  I'm not going to engage in a personal attack on Chris Maddy.
[01:25:47.121 --> 01:25:49.082]  I want to find out who sent the email.
[01:25:49.082 --> 01:25:54.385]  And that's not, that's, they aim at whatever I'm talking about here and that was inadvertent.
[01:25:54.385 --> 01:25:56.326]  And again, we've already clarified that.
[01:25:56.326 --> 01:25:57.887]  So there you go, white shoe boy.
[01:25:57.887 --> 01:26:00.129]  And again, this is the left, this is what they do.
[01:26:03.604 --> 01:26:09.486]  Alex Jones attacked Sandy McFamily's lawyer as Little White Shoe Boy in latest Unhinged Outburst.
[01:26:09.486 --> 01:26:14.368]  And then somebody sending press releases out to the media saying that.
[01:26:14.368 --> 01:26:20.131]  And there's, I've now learned officially during the break, there's three different court transcripts that were done.
[01:26:20.131 --> 01:26:23.152]  Two of them say White Shoe Boy, one of them says White Jew Boy.
[01:26:24.107 --> 01:26:26.868]  The one that says White Jew Boy is not signed.
[01:26:26.868 --> 01:26:38.334]  Somebody is playing games, and we're going to find out who is sending the emails out to the media with a doctored transcript, I believe, saying that.
[01:26:38.334 --> 01:26:40.815]  But you just had your lion ears hear that, didn't you?
[01:26:40.815 --> 01:26:42.116]  All right, we're going to break.
[01:26:42.116 --> 01:26:42.676]  I'm going to reset.
[01:26:42.676 --> 01:26:43.537]  I'm going to get focused.
[01:26:43.537 --> 01:26:45.178]  I'm not going to get angry.
[01:26:45.178 --> 01:26:47.439]  But yes, these things, it just gets under my skin, okay?
[01:26:48.683 --> 01:26:49.983]  It gets under my skin.
[01:26:49.983 --> 01:26:55.025]  You try having a thousand headlines, or more around the country, saying that you're sending people child porn.
[01:26:55.025 --> 01:26:55.985]  You want to get pissed?
[01:26:55.985 --> 01:26:57.786]  This is the way to get pissed.
[01:26:57.786 --> 01:27:01.187]  And I knew where this whole thing was going from the start, but you know what?
[01:27:01.187 --> 01:27:07.649]  I'm proud of what I've done against evil, and I'm proud of what you've done standing with us, and I'd do it all over again.
[01:27:07.649 --> 01:27:10.130]  And it just confirms everything we thought about the system.
[01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:11.611]  It's unbelievably corrupt.
[01:27:11.611 --> 01:27:15.012]  And we got good people trying to fix the system, and they're all being attacked.
[01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:15.972]  And that's why this is happening.
[01:27:17.978 --> 01:27:18.738]  We're going to go to break.
[01:27:18.738 --> 01:27:21.539]  Please don't forget, without your financial support, the enemy will win.
[01:27:21.539 --> 01:27:26.381]  Don't let the Democrats and the Globalists and Soros win.

[01:27:56.259 --> 01:27:57.679]  The average stuff on the market is 3-5%.
[01:27:57.679 --> 01:28:02.261]  I went out to the top producer and I said, I want the strongest ever made.
[01:28:02.261 --> 01:28:03.462]  They said, no one goes above 80%.
[01:28:03.462 --> 01:28:05.063]  We can go to 95% curcuminoid.
[01:28:09.133 --> 01:28:13.576]  And it's for less price than stuff that's 3% that's sold at major health food stores.

[01:29:59.164 --> 01:30:11.115]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:30:11.115 --> 01:30:13.998]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[01:30:14.238 --> 01:30:16.700]  I have labored and labored and labored and labored on this.
[01:30:33.797 --> 01:30:34.757]  I like to be expanding.
[01:30:34.757 --> 01:30:35.518]  I like to be winning.
[01:30:35.518 --> 01:30:36.258]  I like to be fighting.
[01:30:36.258 --> 01:30:37.438]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:30:37.438 --> 01:30:38.319]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:30:38.319 --> 01:30:39.939]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:30:39.939 --> 01:30:41.159]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:30:41.159 --> 01:30:42.200]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.520]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:45.061]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:30:45.061 --> 01:30:49.902]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:30:49.902 --> 01:30:51.923]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:30:51.923 --> 01:30:56.204]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the Chai Comps.
[01:30:56.204 --> 01:30:57.845]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:01.212]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:31:01.212 --> 01:31:06.435]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have.
[01:31:06.435 --> 01:31:09.096]  There's their criminal activity in there and their digital fraud.
[01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:12.759]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:13.679]  We need to end here.
[01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:15.000]  We need to be provisioned.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.661]  And you've got my total commitment.
[01:31:16.761 --> 01:31:19.605]  That I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[01:31:19.605 --> 01:31:23.469]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[01:31:23.469 --> 01:31:25.392]  I'm bloodying them up politically.
[01:31:25.392 --> 01:31:28.956]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[01:31:28.956 --> 01:31:30.378]  That just brings more people here.
[01:31:30.378 --> 01:31:33.682]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[01:31:33.682 --> 01:31:34.523]  I need gas.
[01:31:34.523 --> 01:31:36.045]  I need ammo politically now.
[01:31:36.425 --> 01:31:43.848]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[01:31:43.848 --> 01:31:45.249]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:52.292]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[01:31:52.292 --> 01:31:53.273]  You have my commitment.
[01:31:53.273 --> 01:31:57.615]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:00.782]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[01:32:00.782 --> 01:32:01.962]  This is the maximum alert.
[01:32:01.962 --> 01:32:03.123]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[01:32:03.123 --> 01:32:04.525]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:07.667]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support.
[01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:10.809]  And we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:10.809 --> 01:32:12.611]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:13.231]  There's a P.O.
[01:32:13.231 --> 01:32:14.492]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[01:32:14.492 --> 01:32:16.294]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[01:32:16.294 --> 01:32:17.755]  We need money to fight back.
[01:32:17.895 --> 01:32:20.577]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:23.459]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.

[01:32:34.568 --> 01:32:35.428]  Now back in stock.
[01:32:35.428 --> 01:32:36.509]  RainForce Plus.
[01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:37.310]  TurboForce.
[01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:38.731]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:41.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:27.469 --> 01:33:30.371]  We were 10 minutes from striking Iran.
[01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:34.894]  They may have responded by launching over 100,000 missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[01:33:34.894 --> 01:33:40.518]  But Tucker Carlson and others, last minute, begged the President and said, you're being set up with the neocons.
[01:33:40.518 --> 01:33:43.861]  He decided to call off the raid after he'd already given the order.
[01:33:43.861 --> 01:33:49.825]  I've confirmed that happened from two people involved in the whole situation.
[01:33:49.825 --> 01:33:52.667]  Think about how this country is on a knife's edge.
[01:33:52.667 --> 01:33:54.348]  Trump overall means well, but it's true.
[01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.736]  He can be influenced by people he respects.
[01:33:58.736 --> 01:34:01.000]  That's why they try to control who's around him.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.426]  If Trump had good people around him, he would defeat the globalists very quickly.
[01:34:04.426 --> 01:34:05.748]  Here's the President's latest comments.
[01:34:06.749 --> 01:34:08.751]  You said Iran is a different country.
[01:34:08.751 --> 01:34:10.633]  Do you still hold that opinion?
[01:34:10.633 --> 01:34:11.354]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:34:11.354 --> 01:34:17.680]  When I came here, Iran was in 14 to 18 different sites of confliction.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.221]  They were extremely hostile.
[01:34:19.221 --> 01:34:20.803]  They were hostile when they signed the deal.
[01:34:20.803 --> 01:34:23.546]  They were screaming death to America.
[01:34:23.546 --> 01:34:25.147]  And I think probably Iran
[01:34:26.497 --> 01:34:27.317]  Made a mistake.
[01:34:27.317 --> 01:34:34.059]  I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down.
[01:34:34.059 --> 01:34:36.420]  And fortunately, that drone was unarmed.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:37.281]  It was not.
[01:34:37.281 --> 01:34:39.241]  There was no man in it.
[01:34:39.241 --> 01:34:44.123]  And there was no it was just it was over international waters, clearly over international waters.
[01:34:44.123 --> 01:34:45.903]  But we didn't have a man or woman in the drone.
[01:34:45.903 --> 01:34:47.824]  We had nobody in the drone.
[01:34:47.824 --> 01:34:48.964]  Would have made a big difference.
[01:34:48.964 --> 01:34:51.925]  Let me tell you, would have made a big, big difference.
[01:34:51.925 --> 01:34:53.786]  But I have a feeling
[01:34:54.798 --> 01:34:58.681]  I may be wrong and I may be right, but I'm right a lot.
[01:34:58.681 --> 01:35:04.905]  I have a feeling that it was a mistake made by somebody that shouldn't have been doing what they did.
[01:35:04.905 --> 01:35:05.906]  I think they made a mistake.
[01:35:05.906 --> 01:35:08.107]  And I'm not just talking about the country made a mistake.
[01:35:08.107 --> 01:35:12.250]  I think that somebody under the command of that country made a big mistake.
[01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:14.752]  You're talking to Iran's leadership.
[01:35:14.752 --> 01:35:15.953]  Let's just see what happens.
[01:35:15.953 --> 01:35:17.214]  You just let's see what happens.
[01:35:17.214 --> 01:35:18.495]  It's all going to work out.
[01:35:18.495 --> 01:35:19.015]  Say it.
[01:35:23.928 --> 01:35:24.468]  I don't know.
[01:35:24.468 --> 01:35:27.670]  I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth.
[01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:33.152]  I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.
[01:35:33.152 --> 01:35:39.915]  We'll be able to report back and you'll understand exactly what happened, but it was a very foolish move.
[01:35:39.915 --> 01:35:40.676]  That I can tell you.
[01:35:40.676 --> 01:35:44.397]  Do you feel like there are members of your administration who are trying to push you into conflict?
[01:35:44.397 --> 01:35:45.058]  No, not at all.
[01:35:45.738 --> 01:35:46.379]  Not at all.
[01:35:46.379 --> 01:35:48.540]  In fact, in many cases, it's the opposite.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:52.242]  But I will say, look, I said, I want to get out of these endless wars.
[01:35:52.242 --> 01:35:53.423]  I campaigned on that.
[01:35:53.423 --> 01:35:54.003]  I want to get out.
[01:35:54.003 --> 01:35:56.605]  We've been in Afghanistan for 19 years.
[01:35:56.605 --> 01:36:00.147]  As you know, we've reduced very substantially in Afghanistan.
[01:36:00.147 --> 01:36:01.849]  We beat the caliphate.
[01:36:01.849 --> 01:36:05.031]  We took back 100 percent of the caliphate when it was 99 percent.
[01:36:05.031 --> 01:36:07.352]  Justin, I said, we're going to get out.
[01:36:07.352 --> 01:36:08.493]  We're going to start peeling back.
[01:36:08.493 --> 01:36:09.854]  And everybody went crazy because it was 99.
[01:36:09.854 --> 01:36:11.795]  So I said, all right, so we'll finish it up.
[01:36:11.795 --> 01:36:12.355]  So we got 100 percent.
[01:36:13.616 --> 01:36:17.457]  And we're pulling that back out of Syria, we're pulling a lot of people back.
[01:36:17.457 --> 01:36:24.079]  But this is something, this is a new wrinkle, this is a new fly in the ointment, what happened shooting down the drone.
[01:36:24.079 --> 01:36:27.040]  And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:27.781]  Thank you very much.
[01:36:36.618 --> 01:36:48.829]  You know, I don't normally play air raid sirens and marching, but just to set the flavor here, we've been playing it quite a bit, because if we have a war with Iran, it'll probably turn into a regional war, and then it could expand from there.
[01:36:48.829 --> 01:36:55.815]  We have a military expert, Joel Skousen, the head of WorldAffairsBrief.com, the editor of that, also a well-known author.
[01:36:56.796 --> 01:36:57.437]  We're good to go.
[01:37:12.614 --> 01:37:16.077]  Like, prophetic yesterday, where we've got to get word to Trump.
[01:37:16.077 --> 01:37:18.018]  Tucker Carlson's got to talk to Trump.
[01:37:18.018 --> 01:37:19.619]  Everybody's got to call the White House.
[01:37:19.619 --> 01:37:21.501]  Tell them, don't strike Iran.
[01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:22.341]  It's a setup.
[01:37:22.341 --> 01:37:27.205]  And he orders the strike last minute, calls right back and says, no, we're not going to do it now.
[01:37:27.205 --> 01:37:28.566]  I'm going with my gut.
[01:37:28.566 --> 01:37:29.927]  Like he said, get out of Afghanistan.
[01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:32.208]  The military basically said, no, you can't do it.
[01:37:32.208 --> 01:37:33.630]  He said, well, I'm violating my gut.
[01:37:33.630 --> 01:37:35.571]  OK, we'll keep some troops there.
[01:37:35.571 --> 01:37:36.892]  This is an amazing time, Joel.
[01:37:38.573 --> 01:37:40.074]  How would you characterize what's happened?
[01:37:40.074 --> 01:37:44.455]  And I think the neocons are going to push for more provocations.
[01:37:44.455 --> 01:37:45.936]  Well, indeed they are, Alex.
[01:37:45.936 --> 01:37:50.458]  And the next one is going to be something that involves the killing of American servicemen.
[01:37:50.458 --> 01:37:55.279]  This is the red line that Donald Trump has tacitly set up.
[01:37:55.279 --> 01:38:00.221]  I mean, when he said, and he asked the general, he said, how many people is this strike going to kill?
[01:38:00.221 --> 01:38:01.021]  And he said, about 150.
[01:38:01.021 --> 01:38:04.023]  And he said, no, that's not proportional.
[01:38:04.023 --> 01:38:06.724]  You know, nobody was killed when this drone was shut down.
[01:38:06.724 --> 01:38:07.664]  So he is sensitive.
[01:38:08.453 --> 01:38:11.394]  To the fact that civilian deaths.
[01:38:11.394 --> 01:38:15.456]  He's sensitive to the fact that he's promised to get out of these endless wars.
[01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:19.957]  But I don't buy his excuse that he feels like it was a mistake.
[01:38:19.957 --> 01:38:24.079]  I don't think that Iran shot it down by mistake.
[01:38:24.079 --> 01:38:30.541]  This was an intentional provocation by the Deep State to send a drone over the border into Iran.
[01:38:30.541 --> 01:38:34.223]  And I'm not buying, for example, that it was in international waters.
[01:38:34.223 --> 01:38:36.824]  You've got to remember that the Strait of Hormuz is only 21 miles wide.
[01:38:38.425 --> 01:38:42.267]  Both Oman and Iran own both sides of the strait.
[01:38:42.267 --> 01:38:45.188]  There is no international waters in the Straits of Hormuz.
[01:38:45.188 --> 01:38:47.289]  It's either Iran or Oman.
[01:38:47.289 --> 01:38:53.112]  And they recovered debris from the drone in Iranian waters.
[01:38:53.112 --> 01:38:56.234]  And that indicates that it was tracking.
[01:38:56.234 --> 01:39:02.917]  In fact, I've seen the track that the Iranians provided of the drone and it clearly went into the Iranian side of the border.
[01:39:04.005 --> 01:39:06.106]  So I think this was an intentional provocation.
[01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:08.688]  Iran was right to be able to shoot it down.
[01:39:08.688 --> 01:39:09.968]  This was a spy drone.
[01:39:09.968 --> 01:39:16.272]  Of course, they couldn't tell if this was a Reaper drone or whether or not it was a Reaper Predator drone or a Global Hawk.
[01:39:16.272 --> 01:39:17.933]  From the air, they look the same.
[01:39:17.933 --> 01:39:19.834]  From radar, they look the same.
[01:39:19.834 --> 01:39:27.718]  Both of them, the one that was shot or attempted to shoot down last week and the one that was shot down yesterday, was with the transponder off.
[01:39:28.198 --> 01:39:29.279]  So the U.S.
[01:39:29.279 --> 01:39:36.844]  Central Command says, well, they were in normal airspace of airline traffic going between Oman and another Middle Eastern country.
[01:39:36.844 --> 01:39:37.624]  But that isn't true.
[01:39:37.624 --> 01:39:41.547]  With your transponder off, you're telling him, I'm a military aircraft.
[01:39:41.547 --> 01:39:46.350]  And let's not forget, you are a private pilot, not just a former naval aviator.
[01:39:46.350 --> 01:39:47.511]  By the way, breaking news.
[01:39:47.511 --> 01:39:52.814]  This morning I said, you know, I don't want to believe mainstream news saying that Trump ordered the strike and then called it off.
[01:39:52.814 --> 01:39:54.555]  But all the mainstream media said it was true.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.602]  Uh, the Iranian said, well, he did call and say the strike was happening, but then he called and called it off.
[01:40:00.602 --> 01:40:02.363]  So who knows what's going on now?
[01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:03.384]  I believe Trump.
[01:40:03.384 --> 01:40:10.307]  Mark Deist tweets, turns out it was just more fake news that Trump ordered an attack on Iran, but then called it off at the last minute.
[01:40:10.307 --> 01:40:11.427]  What a shocker.
[01:40:11.427 --> 01:40:16.750]  Trump has just given an interview to Chuck Todd of Meet the Press, an exclusive interview
[01:40:17.330 --> 01:40:21.456]  To his enemies, says he hadn't given the final approval to Iran's strikes.
[01:40:21.456 --> 01:40:28.004]  So is the Pentagon saying that he'd taken the safety off, had gotten the aircraft ready, so technically they believe he'd ordered it?
[01:40:28.004 --> 01:40:30.327]  I mean, this is getting really dangerous.
[01:40:30.327 --> 01:40:31.028]  Let's play this clip.
[01:40:32.329 --> 01:40:37.190]  So did you green light something, or had you said, if we do it, I'll do this?
[01:40:37.190 --> 01:40:38.671]  What was the order you gave?
[01:40:38.671 --> 01:40:41.951]  Nothing is green lighted until the very end, because things change, right?
[01:40:41.951 --> 01:40:43.232]  So you never gave a final order?
[01:40:43.232 --> 01:40:43.972]  No, no, no, no.
[01:40:43.972 --> 01:40:47.413]  But we had something ready to go, subject to my approval.
[01:40:47.413 --> 01:40:50.313]  And they came in, and they came in about a half an hour before.
[01:40:50.313 --> 01:40:51.914]  They said, sir, we're about ready to go.
[01:40:51.914 --> 01:40:55.194]  I said, I want a better demonstration.
[01:40:55.194 --> 01:40:55.915]  Were planes in the air?
[01:40:55.915 --> 01:40:57.015]  No, we're about ready to go.
[01:40:57.875 --> 01:41:00.736]  No, but they would have been pretty soon.
[01:41:00.736 --> 01:41:05.338]  And things would have happened to a point where you wouldn't turn back or couldn't turn back.
[01:41:05.338 --> 01:41:08.019]  So they came and they said, sir, we're ready to go.
[01:41:08.019 --> 01:41:08.940]  We'd like a decision.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.240]  I said, I want to know something before you go.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.001]  How many people will be killed?
[01:41:14.001 --> 01:41:15.942]  In this case, Iranians.
[01:41:15.942 --> 01:41:19.063]  I said, how many people are going to be killed?
[01:41:19.063 --> 01:41:21.064]  Sir, I'd like to get back to you on that.
[01:41:21.064 --> 01:41:22.665]  Great people, these generals.
[01:41:22.665 --> 01:41:24.946]  They said, came back, said, sir,
[01:41:25.914 --> 01:41:27.035]  Approximately 150.
[01:41:27.035 --> 01:41:30.037]  And I thought about it for a second.
[01:41:30.037 --> 01:41:30.758]  I said, you know what?
[01:41:30.758 --> 01:41:37.423]  They shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it.
[01:41:37.423 --> 01:41:46.691]  And here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said, go ahead.
[01:41:46.691 --> 01:41:47.732]  And I didn't like it.
[01:41:47.732 --> 01:41:50.354]  I didn't think it was I didn't think it was proportionate.
[01:41:51.334 --> 01:41:53.855]  So as you said, Joe, that's basically the President's thinking.
[01:41:53.855 --> 01:41:58.056]  So he had the safety off, but hadn't pulled the trigger.
[01:41:58.056 --> 01:41:59.057]  Well, I think that's true.
[01:41:59.057 --> 01:42:01.998]  I don't think airplanes were in the air.
[01:42:01.998 --> 01:42:09.260]  On the aircraft carrier you launched, in close proximity to a target, they probably would have launched 10-15 minutes before the strike.
[01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:13.082]  And so it was probably not airplanes in the air.
[01:42:13.082 --> 01:42:18.804]  But nevertheless, the point is, I'm concerned that Donald Trump is not being given the big picture.
[01:42:18.804 --> 01:42:26.507]  Now, Pepe Escobar in Strategic Culture wrote a major piece where he was going to say, you know, here's the problem.
[01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:28.568]  You're going to close the Straits for a moose.
[01:42:28.568 --> 01:42:30.769]  You're going to raise oil 50%.
[01:42:30.769 --> 01:42:33.069]  You're going to have a derivatives meltdown.
[01:42:33.069 --> 01:42:37.271]  And you're going to have Hezbollah launching thousands of missiles at Israel if you attack Iran.
[01:42:37.871 --> 01:42:42.892]  If he gets that message, he's going to be very, very cautious about going through with this war plan.
[01:42:42.892 --> 01:42:45.773]  But as you said, the neocons aren't going to stop.
[01:42:45.773 --> 01:42:49.134]  I would expect within days, just like we saw last week, a provocation.
[01:42:49.134 --> 01:42:50.534]  Now this, we're going to see more.
[01:42:50.534 --> 01:42:51.594]  How do we avert that?
[01:42:51.594 --> 01:42:54.675]  With Joel Scalzin, Editor-in-Chief at WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:42:54.675 --> 01:42:56.275]  I'm Alex Jones with the NewsWars.com.
[01:42:59.977 --> 01:43:03.200]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:05.141]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:43:05.141 --> 01:43:07.644]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:43:07.644 --> 01:43:08.564]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:43:08.564 --> 01:43:09.045]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:09.045 --> 01:43:10.346]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:10.346 --> 01:43:12.448]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:43:12.448 --> 01:43:16.171]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[01:43:16.171 --> 01:43:18.353]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:43:18.353 --> 01:43:20.314]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:43:20.314 --> 01:43:21.435]  God bless you, brother.
[01:43:21.435 --> 01:43:27.961]  I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[01:43:28.281 --> 01:43:29.382]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:43:29.382 --> 01:43:31.684]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:43:31.684 --> 01:43:34.426]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:43:57.304 --> 01:44:07.186]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[01:44:07.186 --> 01:44:16.187]  The false claim that you purposely sent kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false.
[01:44:16.187 --> 01:44:17.307]  It's a smear.
[01:44:17.307 --> 01:44:19.508]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[01:44:19.508 --> 01:44:20.988]  You don't even open it.
[01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:26.009]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you.
[01:44:27.889 --> 01:44:29.010]  This is bizarre.
[01:44:29.010 --> 01:44:35.212]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say Jones sent kiddie porn is really outrageous.
[01:44:35.212 --> 01:44:40.913]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[01:44:40.913 --> 01:44:42.434]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[01:44:42.434 --> 01:44:43.634]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[01:44:43.634 --> 01:44:45.335]  Where's Associated Press?
[01:44:45.335 --> 01:44:50.896]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[01:44:50.896 --> 01:44:56.338]  So we both need your help, and I urge folks to continue to support InfoWars with your dollars.
[01:44:58.675 --> 01:45:05.317]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[01:45:05.317 --> 01:45:09.999]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[01:45:09.999 --> 01:45:13.740]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:20.485]  That to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[01:45:20.485 --> 01:45:24.608]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS.
[01:45:24.608 --> 01:45:31.514]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:45:31.514 --> 01:45:32.355]  And so we've reached that point.
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.041]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[01:45:35.041 --> 01:45:37.142]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[01:45:37.142 --> 01:45:40.103]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[01:45:40.103 --> 01:45:41.084]  You have been there.
[01:45:41.084 --> 01:45:45.886]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[01:45:45.886 --> 01:45:52.008]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at InfoWars4.com.
[01:45:52.008 --> 01:45:52.989]  It's your fight.
[01:45:52.989 --> 01:45:57.311]  Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[01:45:58.601 --> 01:46:01.686]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:46:01.686 --> 01:46:04.651]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.651 --> 01:46:07.556]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:46:07.556 --> 01:46:12.144]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply, one of the top
[01:46:13.174 --> 01:46:22.317]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.317 --> 01:46:27.658]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:27.658 --> 01:46:29.939]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:29.939 --> 01:46:33.460]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:34.941]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:38.922]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:46:38.922 --> 01:46:41.143]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.143 --> 01:46:42.223]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.683 --> 01:46:44.664]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:47.204]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.204 --> 01:46:52.206]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.206 --> 01:47:01.269]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.269 --> 01:47:03.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.446 --> 01:47:19.031]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:19.031 --> 01:47:30.559]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:30.559 --> 01:47:39.085]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.401]  As above, so below, the old alchemist said.
[01:47:44.401 --> 01:47:46.041]  And it's true.
[01:47:46.041 --> 01:47:48.342]  Trump is dealing with incredible hoaxes by the hour.
[01:47:48.342 --> 01:47:50.303]  So are we.
[01:47:50.303 --> 01:47:59.085]  The latest, Raw Story and others are now retracting that I said that the plaintiff's lawyers for Sandy Hook families are white Jew boys.
[01:47:59.085 --> 01:48:02.066]  And they're having to retract that I sent them child porn.
[01:48:02.066 --> 01:48:04.267]  I got the letter from the Justice Department.
[01:48:04.267 --> 01:48:08.988]  Paul Watts is writing an article right now for InfoWars.com, but I showed that to you last hour.
[01:48:10.353 --> 01:48:14.759]  The left is just getting crazier and crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:48:14.759 --> 01:48:16.182]  Not just here, but all over the world.
[01:48:16.182 --> 01:48:19.606]  Massive censorship is intensifying.
[01:48:19.606 --> 01:48:20.428]  And President Trump
[01:48:22.304 --> 01:48:26.487]  Decided not to kill 150 people, potentially innocent people, that Iran struck.
[01:48:26.487 --> 01:48:28.748]  What about Iran's response, Joel Skousen?
[01:48:28.748 --> 01:48:30.529]  You're a former naval aviator.
[01:48:30.529 --> 01:48:32.490]  You really do a lot of research on international politics.
[01:48:32.490 --> 01:48:34.232]  One of the smartest brains out there.
[01:48:34.232 --> 01:48:43.017]  Obviously won't see you on national news because you tell the truth, but you've headed up some of the biggest movements in this country to try to get conservatism back into Congress.
[01:48:43.017 --> 01:48:45.379]  Been one of the main enemies of the left behind the scenes.
[01:48:45.379 --> 01:48:46.439]  So you're a smart guy.
[01:48:46.439 --> 01:48:47.020]  People should listen.
[01:48:48.751 --> 01:48:50.693]  What do you think this boat's big picture?
[01:48:50.693 --> 01:48:53.576]  What are they going to try next to get this war going?
[01:48:53.576 --> 01:48:56.698]  Carter Carlson said he's in D.C.
[01:48:56.698 --> 01:49:02.343]  Everybody knows this is about going to war for Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[01:49:02.343 --> 01:49:05.386]  Well, Saudi Arabia and Israel are going to get attacked when they do this.
[01:49:05.386 --> 01:49:08.068]  Iran's going to launch huge attacks, it's believed.
[01:49:08.068 --> 01:49:09.349]  Or will Iran just take it?
[01:49:09.349 --> 01:49:11.771]  So, A, how are they going to try to provocate?
[01:49:11.771 --> 01:49:13.813]  And how could this war go from bad to worse?
[01:49:16.201 --> 01:49:26.808]  Well, Iran has been amazingly resistant to the tendency or the temptation to retaliate, knowing that it's going to bring on a full-scale war of destruction from the United States.
[01:49:26.808 --> 01:49:32.091]  So I think that it's very possible that Iran would take a strike.
[01:49:32.091 --> 01:49:36.674]  They would have absorbed the strike, even if it had killed 150 people, probably without retaliating.
[01:49:38.766 --> 01:49:46.790]  But they've got a list on their agenda of things that they can really hurt the world economy, Israel and Saudi Arabia, not to mention U.S.
[01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:48.691]  troops.
[01:49:48.691 --> 01:50:01.518]  They are the major supporter of Hezbollah, which has thousands of small caliber rockets and missiles that they can fire into Israel and overwhelm the Iron Dome system.
[01:50:01.518 --> 01:50:04.640]  In fact, they've been building up those arsenals now for many, many months.
[01:50:05.801 --> 01:50:08.902]  And so it's a real potential threat.
[01:50:08.902 --> 01:50:10.323]  Syria is fairly neutralized.
[01:50:10.323 --> 01:50:15.106]  They can't really handle any attacks on Israel on behalf of Iran.
[01:50:15.106 --> 01:50:20.810]  But Iran's got tremendous missile throw capacity, over a thousand missiles that they could throw into the Middle East.
[01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:21.957]  And the U.S.
[01:50:21.957 --> 01:50:27.461]  Patriot systems or the Israeli systems are not going to be able to handle what they can throw out.
[01:50:27.461 --> 01:50:33.525]  The biggest impact, of course, will be the shutting down of the strait of Hormuz that Iran can do in that very narrow strait.
[01:50:33.525 --> 01:50:39.829]  They can shut down 30% of oil exports around the world, which will cause oil prices to skyrocket.
[01:50:39.829 --> 01:50:42.590]  Insurance rates will skyrocket on ships.
[01:50:42.590 --> 01:50:45.953]  And worse yet, there's the threat of a derivatives meltdown.
[01:50:45.953 --> 01:50:49.515]  That's a quadruple trillion amount of money.
[01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:52.870]  That could start a collapse of the world economy.
[01:50:52.870 --> 01:51:01.953]  Now, that said, the Fed has the capability to declare that there is no emergency and to keep derivatives from collapsing.
[01:51:01.953 --> 01:51:04.754]  And I think that they might pull that off as they have in the past.
[01:51:05.495 --> 01:51:30.747]  But I think it's very, very important to understand that this really is a provocation and a false flag, and in this week's World Affairs Brief, which just came out this morning, I outline all of the details on the former false flags of last week, as well as what's happening this week with the provocation of the drones, and your listeners can get a free copy of that briefing just by emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com, and I'll be happy to share it with them.
[01:51:33.422 --> 01:51:38.565]  Clearly, they want war with Iran, and it's not just Israel and Saudi Arabia that want it.
[01:51:38.565 --> 01:51:42.028]  Clearly, I think they know that it can derail Trump.
[01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:45.910]  You were saying yesterday, though, that it would probably get him re-elected.
[01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:47.211]  I think there's two sides to that.
[01:51:47.211 --> 01:51:57.118]  If it goes badly, and you know, just like supposedly Herbert Walker Bush's war went well, but still people didn't like it just a year after he launched it.
[01:51:59.428 --> 01:52:03.352]  I mean, I don't think Trump's going to be goaded into war unless, like you said, people die.
[01:52:03.352 --> 01:52:11.600]  And the Iranians, as a third point, are reporting that there was a second plane with 35 personnel on board from the U.S.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:14.262]  that was following right beside the drone.
[01:52:14.262 --> 01:52:18.006]  They say as part of the provocation, Reuters reports, that they did not blow that out of the air.
[01:52:19.921 --> 01:52:22.242]  Well, they understand what the U.S.
[01:52:22.242 --> 01:52:28.843]  trigger point is on this, and so it's... But you're right about it being inevitable, and I write about it in today's World Affairs Brief.
[01:52:28.843 --> 01:52:31.044]  Here's the two reasons why this is inevitable.
[01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:41.207]  Number one, which I've covered in the past, Iran is the only Muslim country that is capable of being self-sufficient in airplanes, rockets, missiles, boats.
[01:52:41.207 --> 01:52:43.687]  They've got the full range of weaponry that they're developing.
[01:52:43.687 --> 01:52:44.967]  They're much stronger when the U.S.
[01:52:44.967 --> 01:52:45.868]  tried to take them out in 2004.
[01:52:47.814 --> 01:52:51.336]  And didn't because Israel refused to go ahead with that until the U.S.
[01:52:51.336 --> 01:52:54.639]  took care of Syria, which the Russians thwarted.
[01:52:54.639 --> 01:53:01.503]  But the second major reason is that Iran is the sponsoring nation of all those nations who are savvy about the U.S.
[01:53:01.503 --> 01:53:03.584]  and their phony war on terror.
[01:53:03.584 --> 01:53:10.949]  The nations of Syria, Yemen, and now, which used to be on the side of the globalists but switched sides,
[01:53:11.741 --> 01:53:15.704]  And Iran is back, and Hezbollah, and Lebanon, and Syria.
[01:53:15.704 --> 01:53:18.607]  These nations are fully aware that the U.S.
[01:53:18.607 --> 01:53:23.611]  is backing terror on the world, including ISIS and Al Qaeda, and are fighting against it.
[01:53:23.611 --> 01:53:24.672]  And that's why the U.S.
[01:53:24.672 --> 01:53:29.315]  has put out this major propaganda piece that Iran is the greatest terror sponsor in the world.
[01:53:29.315 --> 01:53:31.677]  It's an absolute falsehood.
[01:53:31.677 --> 01:53:33.819]  They're fighting the U.S.-backed war on terror.
[01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:41.691]  And that's why they're against Saudi Arabia and Israel and Turkey, which has now switched side to the Russian side, is no longer in the U.S.
[01:53:41.691 --> 01:53:42.952]  camp fully in that regard.
[01:53:42.952 --> 01:53:45.133]  But Turkey's got all the intelligence.
[01:53:45.133 --> 01:53:49.114]  They were part of the supply chain to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[01:53:49.114 --> 01:53:50.374]  They know that the U.S.
[01:53:50.374 --> 01:53:52.515]  was sponsoring all of this.
[01:53:52.515 --> 01:53:54.936]  And doesn't that give Turkey incredible blackmail power?
[01:53:55.982 --> 01:53:56.463]  It does.
[01:53:56.463 --> 01:53:58.865]  But the U.S.
[01:53:58.865 --> 01:54:05.272]  has blackmail power, too, because Turkey's a member of NATO and they can threaten to cut off Turkish membership in NATO.
[01:54:05.272 --> 01:54:08.275]  But it's still a giant Mexican standoff.
[01:54:08.275 --> 01:54:14.862]  And you bring in Pakistan and India and the Chinese and the Strait of Hormuz and what's happening in Europe and the collapsing third world.
[01:54:15.703 --> 01:54:17.544]  I know people that go to all these different Caribbean islands.
[01:54:17.544 --> 01:54:18.165]  It used to be nice.
[01:54:18.165 --> 01:54:19.966]  They say they're all becoming hellish.
[01:54:19.966 --> 01:54:23.148]  They're all being found with poison in the alcohol.
[01:54:23.148 --> 01:54:24.489]  People are dying everywhere.
[01:54:24.489 --> 01:54:27.671]  I mean, just things are deteriorating quickly in the world.
[01:54:27.671 --> 01:54:29.192]  Why would you say that's happening?
[01:54:29.192 --> 01:54:37.258]  Blooming populations, overpopulation in the third world, not enough jobs, breakdown of society, evil, corruption.
[01:54:37.258 --> 01:54:38.679]  A. Why is it all breaking down?
[01:54:38.679 --> 01:54:39.879]  Or do you agree it is?
[01:54:39.879 --> 01:54:43.662]  And then B. What's the big hot spot that kicks off the big world war?
[01:54:46.354 --> 01:55:01.184]  Well, things are deteriorating because of globalist intervention and CIA intervention, destabilizing, undermining sanctions that create a lot of social unrest in the Middle East as well as the displacement of millions of people.
[01:55:01.184 --> 01:55:06.668]  They have refugee camps in Jordan and they have them in Turkey and they have them in other countries.
[01:55:06.668 --> 01:55:08.049]  This is a real problem.
[01:55:09.175 --> 01:55:10.076]  For the United States.
[01:55:10.076 --> 01:55:11.897]  And the United States wants that kind of conflict.
[01:55:11.897 --> 01:55:14.059]  They want that kind of social unrest.
[01:55:14.059 --> 01:55:17.542]  And the only reason that Iranians have said death to America is because the U.S.
[01:55:17.542 --> 01:55:20.744]  has had those sanctions on for so many years.
[01:55:20.744 --> 01:55:32.734]  But the one thing I want to get at before I answer the other part of your question, Alex, is I'm really worried that Trump started out this impromptu press conference in the Oval Office bashing Iran.
[01:55:32.734 --> 01:55:35.095]  It shows that he's not getting the message.
[01:55:35.095 --> 01:55:35.616]  Now, I know
[01:55:36.659 --> 01:55:39.660]  You have tried to get information into the White House.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:43.042]  I know Pepe Escobar from the left, he's a Marxist, has tried to get it.
[01:55:43.042 --> 01:55:49.524]  It's the correct truth in this particular case, but I'm not sure that's getting directly to Trump.
[01:55:49.524 --> 01:56:00.548]  Otherwise, he wouldn't continue to parrot the establishment propaganda about Iran being the greatest terror organization in the world and in 56 countries trying to undermine liberty.
[01:56:00.548 --> 01:56:01.529]  It's just not true.
[01:56:03.191 --> 01:56:03.832]  Stay there.
[01:56:03.832 --> 01:56:04.152]  Stay there.
[01:56:04.152 --> 01:56:05.173]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:56:05.173 --> 01:56:14.318]  I want you to talk about solutions and ideas and in ways to put pressure on Trump to know that we understand what he's doing is right and that war is unpopular and how this all unfolds.
[01:56:14.318 --> 01:56:17.120]  We'll come right back in two minutes on this side of break.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:18.021]  One more time to listeners.
[01:56:18.973 --> 01:56:25.338]  We've got all the products you need, the best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the best water filtration, the highest rated air filtration.
[01:56:25.338 --> 01:56:29.321]  Everything we've got is the highest rated for the price.
[01:56:29.321 --> 01:56:30.782]  In fact, document cam shot please, guys.
[01:56:30.782 --> 01:56:33.585]  I'm gonna show people an example of our TV viewers.
[01:56:33.585 --> 01:56:36.147]  So here's a very simple graph, okay?
[01:56:36.147 --> 01:56:41.211]  You can get super high quality stuff supposedly for the cost, okay?
[01:56:41.211 --> 01:56:44.273]  Super high quality stuff as it goes up supposedly costs more.
[01:56:44.273 --> 01:56:45.334]  It's not really true in every case.
[01:56:47.591 --> 01:56:48.211]  Versus cost.
[01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:49.392]  You've got these two lines.
[01:56:49.392 --> 01:56:54.055]  I try to find the best spot of the highest quality product that you can get for an affordable price.
[01:56:54.055 --> 01:57:05.342]  A lot of times that highest quality product for an affordable price is usually right in the middle or even lower than stuff that costs a lot more but isn't as good.
[01:57:05.342 --> 01:57:07.163]  Take ion filters.
[01:57:07.163 --> 01:57:09.064]  Four stage ion filters.
[01:57:09.064 --> 01:57:10.365]  They're like a thousand bucks.
[01:57:10.365 --> 01:57:11.546]  People go buy those thinking they're better.
[01:57:12.486 --> 01:57:15.167]  We could buy units for $300 that are just as good.
[01:57:15.167 --> 01:57:19.009]  When the Alexa Pure Breeze came out a few years ago, it was $300.
[01:57:19.009 --> 01:57:21.130]  They sold so many, they sold it even lower at $250.
[01:57:21.130 --> 01:57:24.272]  The thing costs like $100 for them to make.
[01:57:24.272 --> 01:57:25.593]  It's a four-stage ion filter.
[01:57:25.593 --> 01:57:28.634]  It doesn't have a bunch of fancy stainless steel on it, though.
[01:57:28.634 --> 01:57:30.375]  But it's just as good as units costing $500 to $1,000.
[01:57:30.375 --> 01:57:31.235]  It's on sale right now at $166.
[01:57:36.818 --> 01:57:40.204]  Myself and the distributor both make about $30 on it.
[01:57:40.204 --> 01:57:41.646]  $33 on it apiece.
[01:57:41.646 --> 01:57:42.607]  Every home needs it.
[01:57:42.607 --> 01:57:43.789]  Every room needs it.
[01:57:43.789 --> 01:57:46.534]  Get it today at InfowarStore.com and fund the Infowar.
[01:57:47.549 --> 01:57:52.152]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[01:57:52.152 --> 01:57:54.173]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:57:54.173 --> 01:57:55.274]  Good to talk to you.
[01:57:55.274 --> 01:57:59.897]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:57:59.897 --> 01:58:01.838]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[01:58:01.838 --> 01:58:06.701]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:58:06.701 --> 01:58:08.762]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:58:08.762 --> 01:58:12.684]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:58:12.684 --> 01:58:13.425]  I appreciate that.
[01:58:13.425 --> 01:58:15.046]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:58:15.046 --> 01:58:15.606]  Tell us about it.
[01:58:15.606 --> 01:58:16.406]  Well, it's really great.
[01:58:16.406 --> 01:58:17.707]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:58:17.707 --> 01:58:18.227]  I take it.
[01:58:18.227 --> 01:58:18.948]  It tastes good.
[01:58:18.948 --> 01:58:20.809]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:58:20.809 --> 01:58:22.770]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:25.371]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[01:58:25.371 --> 01:58:26.251]  So I really like it.
[01:58:26.251 --> 01:58:29.113]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:58:29.113 --> 01:58:30.874]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:58:30.874 --> 01:58:32.955]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:58:32.955 --> 01:58:36.297]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:58:36.297 --> 01:58:39.138]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[01:58:39.138 --> 01:58:40.279]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:42.100]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:47.975 --> 01:58:51.557]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:53.338]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:58:53.338 --> 01:59:05.385]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:59:05.385 --> 01:59:10.408]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:59:10.708 --> 01:59:14.571]  Experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:59:14.571 --> 01:59:20.336]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:59:20.336 --> 01:59:25.620]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:59:25.620 --> 01:59:28.242]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:59:28.242 --> 01:59:29.964]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:59:29.964 --> 01:59:39.372]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:59:39.952 --> 01:59:42.593]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:59:42.593 --> 01:59:51.197]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:59:51.197 --> 01:59:53.858]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:14.761 --> 02:00:18.205]  Alright, Joel Skousen, Editor-in-Chief at WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[02:00:18.205 --> 02:00:20.227]  Expert on a lot of things that are unfolding.
[02:00:20.227 --> 02:00:21.468]  Great to have him with us.
[02:00:21.468 --> 02:00:25.112]  In closing, I had to cut you off because of the break.
[02:00:25.112 --> 02:00:26.493]  Ways to stop this.
[02:00:26.493 --> 02:00:28.115]  What's happening in the world.
[02:00:28.115 --> 02:00:29.376]  Why the borders are collapsing.
[02:00:29.376 --> 02:00:32.440]  We know the UN is funding that, but it's obviously getting worse.
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:36.324]  And where you see all this going if Trump and others don't take corrective action.
[02:00:38.928 --> 02:00:52.673]  Well, you know, I've long said I'm pessimistic about long-term change because of how deeply the deep state is hidden down deep in the bowels of government and international government and even in all Western governments.
[02:00:52.673 --> 02:00:57.775]  And then when they have the other existential threats from Russia and China, which eventually are going to attack the West.
[02:00:58.703 --> 02:01:00.805]  But Trump can make a change.
[02:01:00.805 --> 02:01:09.193]  And one of the biggest, you know, agendas of the new world order of the globalist is to create chaos in the world through constant warfare.
[02:01:09.193 --> 02:01:14.538]  This is not the big third world war, which I still believe is going to be triggered by North Korea.
[02:01:15.729 --> 02:01:18.191]  This is going to be a major regional war.
[02:01:18.191 --> 02:01:22.314]  And I'll tell you, if they do in this next false flag attack, attack U.S.
[02:01:22.314 --> 02:01:29.160]  troops and kill Americans, Trump is going to go on a rampage like we've never seen before and there's no stopping him.
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:42.351]  Trump has this psychological problem of getting on a bandwagon once he makes a compromise, like in North Korea, and once he falsely reads Kim Jong-un as sincere and believes his denuclearization
[02:01:43.214 --> 02:01:47.356]  Then he continues to go down that path and almost nothing can stop him.
[02:01:47.356 --> 02:01:52.578]  We're at a junction where Trump has turned back from the brink of war on Iran.
[02:01:52.578 --> 02:02:03.623]  If we can get the proper information, as I've outlined in today's World Affairs Brief on all the false flag proofs that can get to him and what this provocation about the drone was all about.
[02:02:03.623 --> 02:02:12.047]  If this kind of information can get to Donald Trump, we can get him on a track where he starts to back up his decision not to go to war and get on that bandwagon.
[02:02:12.507 --> 02:02:19.911]  And then we've got him charging ahead and slowly, hopefully, we can turn him around on the whole issue of Iran being the boogeyman.
[02:02:19.911 --> 02:02:29.236]  Now, ultimately, Alex, he's got to get a briefing sometime about the deep state and how they created terrorists, how they created ISIS, how they still use terrorism.
[02:02:29.236 --> 02:02:33.639]  And it's not enough to say we've got people in the White House will accept this.
[02:02:33.639 --> 02:02:35.200]  I don't think it's getting to Trump yet.
[02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:37.502]  Because of the way he talks about Iran.
[02:02:37.502 --> 02:02:41.605]  Well, Joe, you saw him come out and say that Hillary and Obama founded ISIS.
[02:02:41.605 --> 02:02:43.386]  He gets the briefings.
[02:02:43.386 --> 02:02:45.488]  And it's not that he has a bad memory.
[02:02:45.488 --> 02:02:52.314]  It's that he gets it, and then he gets other stuff, and then he gets, he knows all this.
[02:02:52.314 --> 02:02:53.695]  I don't know how you would describe Trump.
[02:02:53.695 --> 02:02:56.838]  He's real sharp when you talk to him, and he has a lot of energy.
[02:02:56.838 --> 02:03:01.682]  But I just wonder sometimes, because I used to hear this, oh, he goes with the last thing he heard.
[02:03:01.682 --> 02:03:03.623]  I think, oh, that's leftist propaganda.
[02:03:03.623 --> 02:03:04.424]  No, it's kind of true.
[02:03:06.101 --> 02:03:11.126]  No, he really didn't say directly that Obama and Clinton funded ISIS.
[02:03:11.126 --> 02:03:13.207]  He said they were the founders of it.
[02:03:15.618 --> 02:03:16.959]  That's not what he meant.
[02:03:16.959 --> 02:03:28.067]  You know, in his loose way of speaking, he was referring to the fact that Obama signed this Iran agreement and they did other things that allowed ISIS to grow up in this vacuum.
[02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:28.907]  Yes.
[02:03:28.907 --> 02:03:29.868]  I'm not doing anything.
[02:03:29.868 --> 02:03:38.694]  But he does not know that our own deep state actually created ISIS by separating 50% of the Syrian rebels and saying, you're now called ISIS.
[02:03:38.694 --> 02:03:39.075]  Sure, sure.
[02:03:39.075 --> 02:03:40.055]  You're right overall on that.
[02:03:40.055 --> 02:03:40.496]  You're correct.
[02:03:41.316 --> 02:03:42.898]  It's not splitting hairs, but you're right.
[02:03:42.898 --> 02:03:44.380]  Let's expand on this in 60 seconds.
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:52.448]  What do you make of Trump making comments that they expunged off the internet on Meet the Press last week that he knows who really did 9-11?
[02:03:52.448 --> 02:04:00.816]  Well, I don't think he does know because it's not the government and that's who did 9-11 and that's not who he's referring to.
[02:04:00.816 --> 02:04:04.200]  So, you know, Trump just doesn't have the basis.
[02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:07.508]  To make informed decisions about the deep state.
[02:04:07.508 --> 02:04:17.642]  He continues to prove that he doesn't... By the way, Joel, you've got to stay a few more minutes now because I've decided that when I cover 9-11 and the fact that it was an inside job...
[02:04:18.843 --> 02:04:33.856]  If we say that, we've got to then do a five-minute dissertation on the main anomalies of it, because obviously I was the first to officially question it, and all the rest of it, and people think we're blaming our country, not criminal elements of the government, and so I think that's important.
[02:04:33.856 --> 02:04:37.199]  So can you do five more minutes and elaborate on why you're saying 9-11 is an inside job?
[02:04:37.939 --> 02:04:39.140]  I'll be happy to.
[02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:42.024]  Alright, we'll come back and we'll have the floor for five minutes.
[02:04:42.024 --> 02:04:51.273]  That means I'm gonna shut up because if I start getting into 9-11, I mean, I've made four films on it, I've done thousands of shows on it, and it just gives me a headache.
[02:04:51.273 --> 02:04:53.596]  It was an inside job, but what is an inside job?
[02:04:56.138 --> 02:05:01.563]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[02:05:01.563 --> 02:05:03.364]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[02:05:03.364 --> 02:05:05.106]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[02:05:05.106 --> 02:05:06.947]  Now, I can make them strong.
[02:05:06.947 --> 02:05:08.609]  Now, I can instruct them.
[02:05:08.609 --> 02:05:10.330]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[02:05:10.330 --> 02:05:11.311]  But not once I'm gone.
[02:05:11.411 --> 02:05:16.554]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[02:05:16.554 --> 02:05:22.138]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[02:05:22.138 --> 02:05:25.781]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[02:05:25.781 --> 02:05:26.821]  I can't be destroyed now.
[02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:32.165]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[02:05:32.165 --> 02:05:41.311]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[02:05:41.411 --> 02:05:49.043]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[02:05:49.043 --> 02:05:55.654]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[02:06:07.861 --> 02:06:11.965]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:06:11.965 --> 02:06:14.887]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.887 --> 02:06:17.569]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[02:06:17.569 --> 02:06:17.970]  That's true.
[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:24.123]  He also said, the only thing that evil men in tyrancy deflourish is that good men do nothing.
[02:06:24.123 --> 02:06:39.455]  Well, Joel Skousen is a really smart, formal, net-enabled aviator, the top expert in the world on secure homes, best-selling author, and his whole family are full of a lot of great folks, like Joel Skousen's uncle, Cleon Skousen, that was head of the FBI in Utah.
[02:06:40.155 --> 02:06:49.057]  And wrote to the Naked Communists, the Naked Capitalists, that was the blueprint for Barry Goldwater, then Ron Paul, and the whole resistance that we now have today.
[02:06:49.057 --> 02:06:49.698]  He was dead on.
[02:06:49.698 --> 02:06:51.078]  John Birch Society, all of it.
[02:06:51.078 --> 02:06:52.618]  Great people.
[02:06:52.618 --> 02:06:58.300]  Really, the blood of freedom and resistance to this.
[02:06:58.300 --> 02:07:03.681]  And so, we don't say 9-11 is an inside job to put down America, or we hate the American flag.
[02:07:03.681 --> 02:07:06.622]  No, ladies and gentlemen, we say that because
[02:07:08.137 --> 02:07:16.446]  Criminal elements are working with radical Islam in a dialectic to invade the Middle East, to destabilize it, to then collapse Europe's borders.
[02:07:16.446 --> 02:07:22.031]  They want the Middle East to fail, not to stop Islam, but to radicalize it and collapse it further.
[02:07:22.031 --> 02:07:24.794]  They need to be attacked so they have an ethos to attack us.
[02:07:25.615 --> 02:07:29.939]  So, since you mentioned it, Joel, you can have five minutes, ten minutes, whatever amount of time you want.
[02:07:29.939 --> 02:07:39.607]  From a guy that's landed on the decks of aircraft carriers, and from a guy that's a smart fella, and has written a lot of material that's proven to be accurate, when we say inside job, what do we mean?
[02:07:39.607 --> 02:07:42.290]  When Trump says, I know who did it, I may bring it out.
[02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:43.431]  He was on television.
[02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:46.555]  Two days after 9-11, we played this clip.
[02:07:46.555 --> 02:07:52.285]  In fact, when we post this later to InfoWars.com, we're not live, we'll add the two or three shows.
[02:07:52.285 --> 02:07:56.734]  CNN, local news, where he said there were bombs in the buildings, they blew them up.
[02:07:56.734 --> 02:07:57.034]  Actually...
[02:07:58.444 --> 02:07:59.684]  Trump does know who did it.
[02:07:59.684 --> 02:08:06.827]  I don't think he's ready to give out the specifics, but when he says Hillary founded ISIS, you're right.
[02:08:06.827 --> 02:08:08.428]  They're staying out of the Iran deal.
[02:08:08.428 --> 02:08:15.471]  But when you say 9-11 is an inside job, Joel Skousen, editor-in-chief at WorldAtFirstBrief.com, what do you mean?
[02:08:15.471 --> 02:08:16.091]  Quantify that.
[02:08:17.449 --> 02:08:26.661]  When I looked at 9-11 in detail, I began to realize immediately there are many, many things here that the terrorists could not simply have done if they were ordinary terrorists.
[02:08:26.661 --> 02:08:35.193]  For example, as a pilot, I know that a terrorist training on a Cessna aircraft wouldn't even know how to turn off the autopilot and take control of the airplane.
[02:08:35.976 --> 02:08:38.456]  He wouldn't know how to drive that airplane over.
[02:08:38.456 --> 02:08:47.598]  You have to be a pilot to realize how big the East Coast is and from the Midwest to drive that airplane and find New York would be an impossibility without the navigation system.
[02:08:47.598 --> 02:08:54.599]  And it takes three to six months to learn how to do all of these electronic glass cockpit procedures.
[02:08:54.599 --> 02:09:00.561]  There's no way that a terrorist with minimal training and couldn't even fly a Cessna is going to be able to control those airplanes.
[02:09:00.561 --> 02:09:02.721]  As a pilot for 9-11 Truth, as a member
[02:09:03.655 --> 02:09:23.805]  We had access to the radar tapes, for example, showing that these airplanes that took off from Boston Logan Airport rendezvoused with other airplanes from the West Coast, which I believe were military aircraft, drone-controlled, computer-controlled aircraft that were loaded with equipment and explosives to be able to fly those into the tower.
[02:09:23.805 --> 02:09:28.848]  But those aircraft that took off did not, in fact, return and fly into that.
[02:09:28.848 --> 02:09:32.129]  And the same thing happened with the Flight 77 that flew into the Pentagon.
[02:09:33.871 --> 02:09:46.501]  For example, there's evidence, abundant evidence, that there had to have been a missile on that airplane and terrorists could not have put the missile on because there was a hole in that airplane when it crashed into the Pentagon.
[02:09:46.501 --> 02:09:51.645]  It exceeded the G-forces that were capable of that airplane unless it was beefed up with stronger engines.
[02:09:51.645 --> 02:09:57.009]  That means it had to be a military-style aircraft painted to look like an American Airlines
[02:09:58.437 --> 02:10:00.058]  Uh, you know, aircraft.
[02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:08.581]  But one of the key witnesses who saw that aircraft crash into the Pentagon said he saw the airplane crumple up onto the wall.
[02:10:08.581 --> 02:10:14.764]  The wall held up like a champ, and then the aircraft exploded into 1000 pieces.
[02:10:14.764 --> 02:10:18.126]  And that tells you that that airplane was loaded with explosives.
[02:10:18.126 --> 02:10:21.467]  That's why there were only confetti sized pieces around the Pentagon.
[02:10:22.248 --> 02:10:25.069]  It wasn't that the crash itself would do that.
[02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:31.991]  In fact, one of the key elements, if you look at the debris that was found inside the Pentagon, was half of a radome.
[02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:40.273]  Now, that's the fiberglass nose of an aircraft, which, had it hit an intact wall of the Pentagon, would have shattered into a thousand pieces.
[02:10:40.273 --> 02:10:48.695]  To have half of that radome inside the Pentagon means that there had to be a hole in that wall before that airplane crashed.
[02:10:48.695 --> 02:10:51.476]  And no terrorist could have put a missile on that airplane.
[02:10:52.196 --> 02:11:02.879]  No terrorist could have made the modification, for example, on the 767 which flew into the second, the South Tower, which we all saw that bulging modification.
[02:11:02.879 --> 02:11:11.921]  I called Boeing after that, as a pilot, and I said, did you authorize that modification on the Boeing aircraft that hit the tower?
[02:11:11.921 --> 02:11:19.283]  Knowing as an F-4 pilot that every modification we did, and the military did that, had to be signed off by the manufacturer.
[02:11:19.283 --> 02:11:19.863]  And Boeing said,
[02:11:20.569 --> 02:11:21.789]  We didn't do it.
[02:11:21.789 --> 02:11:25.151]  Now this spokesman did not deny that there was no bulge on the air.
[02:11:25.151 --> 02:11:28.792]  They just said we didn't do that modification.
[02:11:28.792 --> 02:11:33.493]  So Boeing was acknowledging to me that they had actually modified that aircraft.
[02:11:33.493 --> 02:11:37.195]  Every pilot does a walk around the aircraft or at least the co-pilot does.
[02:11:37.195 --> 02:11:42.377]  And I know you're going into areas where you're an expert as a naval pilot and the famous pilot and then got it survived a crash.
[02:11:42.377 --> 02:11:43.677]  Nobody else would and all the rest of
[02:11:44.357 --> 02:11:47.198]  But what about building 7 with the CIA and FBI in it?
[02:11:47.198 --> 02:11:48.579]  47 stories tall.
[02:11:48.579 --> 02:11:51.400]  They say on the news it's collapsed in its own footprint.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.501]  An hour before it collapsed, it was 25 minutes before.
[02:11:54.501 --> 02:11:59.222]  And then I interviewed the head of emergency management, the deputy head, who they said died a week after he was on the show.
[02:11:59.222 --> 02:12:02.804]  But really, they witness relocated him for national security reasons.
[02:12:02.804 --> 02:12:04.144]  I mean, they blew that sucker up.
[02:12:04.144 --> 02:12:05.305]  They had a countdown.
[02:12:05.305 --> 02:12:09.146]  I've talked to the cops that were there who heard the FEMA countdown to blow it up.
[02:12:10.971 --> 02:12:12.052]  Exactly true.
[02:12:12.052 --> 02:12:17.695]  All of these buildings, the Towers 1 and 2 and Building 7 came down with controlled demolition.
[02:12:17.695 --> 02:12:21.156]  It was a much more sophisticated on Towers 1 and 2.
[02:12:21.156 --> 02:12:29.701]  It's very obvious if you read the your audience listens to the tape recordings and the material from Architects for 9-11 Truth, the case is an absolute slam dunk.
[02:12:30.453 --> 02:12:36.758]  That these towers resisted and did not collapse because of the aircraft crashing into them.
[02:12:36.758 --> 02:12:39.360]  They were taken down by controlled demolition.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:42.042]  And Building 7 is so obvious, controlled demolition.
[02:12:42.042 --> 02:12:48.708]  And it shows, for example, how the United States has power over the National Institute of Technology, or NIST.
[02:12:49.522 --> 02:12:56.644]  That they actually got these certified engineers to falsely say that the building came down without controlled demolition.
[02:12:56.644 --> 02:12:59.325]  Now that shows how much power the deep state had.
[02:12:59.325 --> 02:13:08.708]  But when you go through all of these things, including Dick Cheney and the situation in the room in the White House, telling this Air Force officer the orders still stand, meaning you cannot interdict this airplane.
[02:13:08.708 --> 02:13:13.050]  And we know that from the head of Department of Transportation and other witnesses.
[02:13:14.332 --> 02:13:22.778]  That's right, who were there in the White House, in the Situation Room and saw Cheney, whipping his head around and said, have the orders changed?
[02:13:22.778 --> 02:13:23.898]  No, they have not changed.
[02:13:23.898 --> 02:13:25.940]  You know, let that airplane hit the Pentagon.
[02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:28.441]  It's 100 miles out, it's 50 miles out, it's 20 miles out.
[02:13:28.441 --> 02:13:29.542]  Sir, the orders still changed.
[02:13:29.542 --> 02:13:31.804]  I didn't tell you they changed?
[02:13:31.804 --> 02:13:34.225]  There was a stand-down.
[02:13:34.225 --> 02:13:35.446]  There was a stand-down.
[02:13:35.446 --> 02:13:39.369]  And much of, of course, there were, you know,
[02:13:40.783 --> 02:13:51.029]  Scenarios going on where they had airplanes in the air, doing dive bombing at the White House, telling NATO that these are all controlled exercises, you're not to interdict any of these aircraft.
[02:13:51.029 --> 02:13:55.152]  All of this could not have been done by the terrorists, loading those buildings with explosives.
[02:13:55.152 --> 02:13:56.632]  Sure, what about Flight 93?
[02:13:56.632 --> 02:14:05.758]  The word is, because we even know they gave them awards, and it came out in the audio tapes from NORAD, they said they put two AIM-9s into Flight 93, which would be a sidewinder.
[02:14:07.213 --> 02:14:07.934]  Well, that's right.
[02:14:07.934 --> 02:14:24.837]  In fact, I was listening to the FAA tapes as a pilot, and I heard the United FAA calling for Flight 93, which wasn't responding, and United Flight in the central FAA sector said, we have this aircraft in sight.
[02:14:25.883 --> 02:14:27.323]  And we'll try to contact him.
[02:14:27.323 --> 02:14:28.304]  They tried to contact.
[02:14:28.304 --> 02:14:28.824]  There was nothing.
[02:14:28.824 --> 02:14:33.705]  And then suddenly, you see on the tape recording, it says this is a hijacking, etc.
[02:14:33.705 --> 02:14:35.586]  And there's a bomb on board.
[02:14:35.586 --> 02:14:42.388]  And apparently the hijacker was keying the microphone, transmitting when he thought he was talking on the intercom.
[02:14:42.388 --> 02:14:44.308]  And the United Pilots heard it.
[02:14:44.308 --> 02:14:49.449]  And then the United Pilots said to the controllers, this airplane just exploded.
[02:14:49.449 --> 02:14:51.690]  There was a bomb or something that went on board.
[02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:54.751]  And they saw the explosion, but the airplane did not go down.
[02:14:56.205 --> 02:14:59.401]  And it kept flying, but they saw an actual explosion on board.
[02:15:00.740 --> 02:15:05.061]  Well, airplane Flight 93 did not crash in Shanksville.
[02:15:05.061 --> 02:15:09.222]  The amount of debris there is not consistent with any large aircraft flying.
[02:15:09.222 --> 02:15:11.162]  It was never recovered that degree.
[02:15:11.162 --> 02:15:13.003]  In fact, one witness... So here's the problem.
[02:15:13.003 --> 02:15:14.503]  You just did like eight, nine minutes.
[02:15:14.503 --> 02:15:15.623]  We can go for ten days.
[02:15:15.623 --> 02:15:18.244]  I know you've got things to do and it's important.
[02:15:18.244 --> 02:15:25.045]  We should make a whole new film in retrospect about 9-11, you know, final autopsy or something, because you can go on for days.
[02:15:25.045 --> 02:15:26.986]  And what was the real target of that?
[02:15:28.112 --> 02:15:28.532]  Everything.
[02:15:28.532 --> 02:15:35.798]  Why don't you come back on in the next few weeks and we'll do two hours, you and I. We'll kind of map it out on 9-11.
[02:15:35.798 --> 02:15:37.319]  How's that sound?
[02:15:37.319 --> 02:15:37.459]  Good.
[02:15:37.459 --> 02:15:39.601]  Maybe we can do that in studio sometime, Alex.
[02:15:39.601 --> 02:15:41.643]  Well, hey, I'll fly you here whenever you're ready.
[02:15:41.643 --> 02:15:44.064]  You name the time, we'll fly to Austin as soon as possible.
[02:15:44.064 --> 02:15:45.105]  In fact, set that up.
[02:15:45.105 --> 02:15:45.405]  All right.
[02:15:45.405 --> 02:15:46.586]  God bless you, Joel Skousen.
[02:15:46.586 --> 02:15:47.687]  We appreciate you.
[02:15:47.687 --> 02:15:49.088]  Worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:15:49.088 --> 02:15:49.609]  Thank you, sir.
[02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:50.730]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:50.730 --> 02:15:51.510]  Folks, check into 9-11.
[02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:52.251]  Stay with us.
[02:15:55.345 --> 02:16:06.535]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:16:06.535 --> 02:16:15.844]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:16:15.844 --> 02:16:20.929]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:25.334]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location.
[02:16:25.334 --> 02:16:33.323]  And rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:16:33.323 --> 02:16:34.565]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:16:34.565 --> 02:16:36.567]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System.
[02:16:36.747 --> 02:16:37.989]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.129 --> 02:17:00.052]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.052 --> 02:17:01.593]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.593 --> 02:17:04.555]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.555 --> 02:17:10.119]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.119 --> 02:17:11.319]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.319 --> 02:17:14.261]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:08.172]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks, as you've seen.
[02:18:08.172 --> 02:18:18.696]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you could say about people, that you knew they were liars.
[02:18:18.696 --> 02:18:20.377]  You went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:18:20.377 --> 02:18:25.539]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart.
[02:18:25.539 --> 02:18:26.760]  And I want you to know that love is right back

[02:18:56.681 --> 02:18:58.542]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[02:18:58.542 --> 02:18:59.802]  This is the maximum alert.
[02:18:59.802 --> 02:19:00.963]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[02:19:00.963 --> 02:19:02.363]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[02:19:02.363 --> 02:19:05.504]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support.
[02:19:05.504 --> 02:19:08.506]  And we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:08.506 --> 02:19:10.446]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[02:19:10.446 --> 02:19:11.067]  There's a P.O.
[02:19:11.067 --> 02:19:12.327]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[02:19:12.327 --> 02:19:14.128]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[02:19:14.128 --> 02:19:17.289]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action.
[02:19:17.329 --> 02:19:17.849]  We're good to go.
[02:19:37.482 --> 02:19:39.323]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:18.319 --> 02:20:22.703]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:20:22.703 --> 02:20:23.944]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:23.944 --> 02:20:37.435]  Alright, I intend to take phone calls for the rest of the hour.
[02:20:37.435 --> 02:20:43.701]  And a little bit into the next hour, the McPeggots will take over at 15 after.
[02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:46.023]  And I'll get that number out here in just a few minutes.
[02:20:47.278 --> 02:20:49.600]  Let's get the great John Harmon in the com if we can.
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:54.985]  Get your calls lined up and ready here in a few minutes when I give that number out.
[02:20:54.985 --> 02:21:01.392]  I've been preoccupied obviously covering the Iran crisis because that could end human life on this planet pretty quick.
[02:21:02.660 --> 02:21:15.931]  And I've got a bunch of other huge breaking stories here that are up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, but I want to hear from you specifically about what do you think Trump should do concerning Iran?
[02:21:15.931 --> 02:21:19.074]  I don't like to mollusk, I'd like to see the regime change, but clearly
[02:21:20.928 --> 02:21:23.931]  Israel, Saudi Arabia want us to do their dirty work.
[02:21:23.931 --> 02:21:25.613]  And Iran is not Iraq.
[02:21:25.613 --> 02:21:26.914]  They've got a lot of high-tech weapons.
[02:21:26.914 --> 02:21:28.896]  They've got sleeper cells.
[02:21:28.896 --> 02:21:30.598]  This is going to get really bad.
[02:21:30.598 --> 02:21:31.839]  They blocked us straight at Hormuz.
[02:21:31.839 --> 02:21:34.562]  It's going to kill the recovery.
[02:21:34.562 --> 02:21:36.404]  People, the left is maneuvering.
[02:21:36.404 --> 02:21:38.266]  Here's the key I wanted to say.
[02:21:38.266 --> 02:21:41.890]  The left is maneuvering that Trump saying the nuclear deal is bad.
[02:21:45.003 --> 02:21:49.484]  Is causing Iran to do all this stuff while they engage in provocations.
[02:21:49.484 --> 02:21:57.985]  So they're maneuvering him to say, oh, you, you, you broke the nuclear deal that was a scam by Clinton, Kerry, Obama.
[02:21:57.985 --> 02:22:01.366]  And so then when there's a big war, they're going to blame Trump on top of it.
[02:22:01.366 --> 02:22:03.266]  And Trump knows he's being maneuvered into that.
[02:22:03.266 --> 02:22:06.907]  Okay.
[02:22:06.907 --> 02:22:09.067]  But still they're going to continue to do it.
[02:22:09.067 --> 02:22:09.907]  You heard Joel Skousen.
[02:22:09.907 --> 02:22:12.208]  He's accurate about 98% of the time.
[02:22:14.451 --> 02:22:15.811]  Just like we are.
[02:22:15.811 --> 02:22:18.172]  He's been wrong about a few things, he admits to it.
[02:22:18.172 --> 02:22:19.892]  He thought we were going to war with North Korea.
[02:22:19.892 --> 02:22:22.673]  Because Trump was very serious about it.
[02:22:22.673 --> 02:22:27.794]  But North Korea backed down some, but then has now been welching on that deal.
[02:22:27.794 --> 02:22:29.934]  But hey, do I want war with North Korea?
[02:22:29.934 --> 02:22:35.255]  And I get the fact you don't want nuclear weapons to proliferate, but it was the Clintons that gave all the missile secrets out.
[02:22:35.255 --> 02:22:38.055]  And the ICBM technology.
[02:22:38.055 --> 02:22:40.596]  And the MIRV technology, the Reentry Delivery Devices.
[02:22:43.482 --> 02:22:48.363]  So yeah, this is a very, very, very, very, very, very dangerous time.
[02:22:48.363 --> 02:22:50.704]  And I want to take your calls on it.
[02:22:50.704 --> 02:22:51.644]  Where do you think it's going?
[02:22:51.644 --> 02:22:52.684]  What's your gut level tell you?
[02:22:52.684 --> 02:22:54.125]  Specifically on Iran.
[02:22:54.125 --> 02:22:54.265]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:22:54.265 --> 02:22:55.445]  877-789-2539.
[02:22:55.445 --> 02:22:56.225]  First time callers.
[02:22:56.225 --> 02:22:57.125]  Long time callers.
[02:22:57.125 --> 02:22:57.745]  But on this subject.
[02:22:57.745 --> 02:22:57.785]  877-789-2539.
[02:23:06.650 --> 02:23:15.392]  If you've been a Navy SEAL or been in the military or been an expert that dealt with Iran on an AWACS, if you've got Iran expertise, tell us, we'll go to the head of the line.
[02:23:15.392 --> 02:23:17.393]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:23:17.393 --> 02:23:23.294]  The one thing I didn't get to Joel with, which I know he knows about, is the Hezbollah sleeper cells all over Europe and the U.S.
[02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:28.156]  Shiites aren't like a fake foe army like the Wahhabists.
[02:23:28.156 --> 02:23:31.117]  And you've got all the rest of this going on.
[02:23:31.117 --> 02:23:32.437]  They're in bed with the Democrats.
[02:23:32.437 --> 02:23:34.237]  There's just a lot of double-crossing.
[02:23:34.237 --> 02:23:36.118]  And Trump is right to stay out of that war.
[02:23:38.991 --> 02:23:48.455]  To stay out of that war, stay out of that war, stay out of that war, because they want to get everybody over a barrel.
[02:23:48.455 --> 02:23:59.359]  In other news, Kit Daniels writes for NewsWorks.com, please get this story out, Jussie Smollett could face new charges as special prosecutor steps in.
[02:23:59.359 --> 02:24:04.021]  The more we keep Jussie Smollett in the news, the more we keep the Covington kids in the news.
[02:24:07.267 --> 02:24:15.392]  The more we keep info wars in the news, that pisses the globalist off, because people get reminded of all this hoaxing.
[02:24:15.392 --> 02:24:17.553]  Look, I love everybody.
[02:24:17.553 --> 02:24:18.954]  I'm a Christian.
[02:24:18.954 --> 02:24:20.674]  And it's not just a name.
[02:24:20.674 --> 02:24:26.338]  I have an ethos of loving black people, loving white people, loving Hispanics, loving humans.
[02:24:26.338 --> 02:24:28.319]  But let's not lie to ourselves.
[02:24:28.319 --> 02:24:31.981]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, where
[02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:40.224]  I don't know, about 20% of black people are the most foaming at the mouth racist you've ever seen.
[02:24:40.224 --> 02:24:46.908]  You might go over with your football buddy and his mama makes you the best, you know, southern cooking you ever got.
[02:24:46.908 --> 02:24:50.550]  Northerners call it soul food to make a big thing about it, it's just southern cooking.
[02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:56.894]  But then when you're walking home, a couple black dudes try to kill you because you're a white cracker.
[02:24:56.894 --> 02:25:01.577]  So the fact that black people are the only ones that ever got attacked is a load of crap.
[02:25:03.089 --> 02:25:10.594]  And if you think there's really white people in Chicago at 2.30 at night trying to beat up a black guy, you're crazy.
[02:25:10.594 --> 02:25:18.139]  Any black guy will tell you, number one problem black guys have isn't the cops.
[02:25:18.139 --> 02:25:21.922]  Some black guys may have chips on their shoulders about the cops, and there's some bad cops out there.
[02:25:21.922 --> 02:25:22.662]  I've run into them.
[02:25:22.662 --> 02:25:23.503]  There's bad people, period.
[02:25:27.492 --> 02:25:29.514]  Everybody knows the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:29.514 --> 02:25:30.735]  The statistics show it.
[02:25:30.735 --> 02:25:34.098]  A black man's biggest problem is another black man.
[02:25:34.098 --> 02:25:35.059]  Now, you think I like that?
[02:25:35.059 --> 02:25:35.879]  No.
[02:25:35.879 --> 02:25:43.306]  And I like those speakers that got booed at the reparations who were saying, how about the Democratic Party that literally ran slavery?
[02:25:43.306 --> 02:25:45.107]  How about you pay reparations?
[02:25:45.107 --> 02:25:49.571]  You're actually an organization, a corporation that existed then and exists now.
[02:25:49.571 --> 02:25:52.834]  Not somebody's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great granddaddy.
[02:25:52.834 --> 02:25:54.095]  They don't even know who they are.
[02:25:54.095 --> 02:25:54.996]  They get a bill in the mail.
[02:25:56.749 --> 02:25:57.649]  And you expand on that.
[02:25:57.649 --> 02:26:12.554]  That's when it gets even crazier, is you realize that the Democratic Party wants to totally and completely disenfranchise people.
[02:26:12.554 --> 02:26:20.417]  And they want to open old wounds over, and I'm not trying to keep black people from getting money.
[02:26:20.417 --> 02:26:24.378]  I'm pointing out you're not going to get that money without a bunch of strings attached from these evil Democrats.
[02:26:26.175 --> 02:26:32.800]  The former NFL player, he's the guy that really knocked it out of the park.
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.161]  It's all reparations business.
[02:26:34.161 --> 02:26:44.088]  A bunch of politicians teaching you how they're going to take care of you if you can't take care of yourself.
[02:26:44.088 --> 02:26:46.209]  It's disgusting.
[02:26:46.209 --> 02:26:50.932]  And it's a bunch of leaders who want to get part of that money that you're never going to see.
[02:26:50.932 --> 02:26:52.814]  And again, he pointed out, it's a Democratic Party.
[02:26:55.134 --> 02:27:00.701]  Made sure 40 plus percent of black babies never made it out of their mama.
[02:27:00.701 --> 02:27:04.385]  That's why I've had leftists so many years ago who thought I was a racist like them.
[02:27:04.385 --> 02:27:07.368]  And I told you this stuff 20 years ago before it was ever on TV.
[02:27:07.368 --> 02:27:12.675]  I said, listen, I'll go to these Planned Parenthood events and I'll go to these deals and protest them.
[02:27:14.221 --> 02:27:23.324]  And black people walk over, before the age of cell phones, who are usually the local managers for the white folks, and white folks too, and they'll go, listen.
[02:27:23.324 --> 02:27:27.226]  I don't even want to say the things they say, because the media will say I said them, but you know what they say.
[02:27:27.226 --> 02:27:33.088]  If you live in a black community, you've been around these managers, these white people, these black people that manage the other black people.
[02:27:33.088 --> 02:27:33.588]  And they'll say, listen.
[02:27:34.721 --> 02:27:36.202]  We're trying to get rid of these people.
[02:27:36.202 --> 02:27:37.963]  Nobody wants these blah blah blah.
[02:27:37.963 --> 02:27:39.785]  And now you see all the videos of people saying it.
[02:27:39.785 --> 02:27:41.686]  You see the abortion doctors saying it.
[02:27:41.686 --> 02:27:42.887]  Black abortion doctors.
[02:27:42.887 --> 02:27:47.931]  Asian abortion doctors going, if we don't kill these black people now, we have to kill them later.
[02:27:47.931 --> 02:27:50.292]  Black people are bad.
[02:27:50.292 --> 02:27:54.936]  And it's like, well yeah, because you're setting up a system that's geared to that and you're telling them they are.
[02:27:54.936 --> 02:27:56.877]  And then you're filling them for all this hate.
[02:27:56.877 --> 02:27:57.718]  God, you're nasty.
[02:27:59.198 --> 02:28:08.644]  So they got so many chips on their shoulders, they can't get a job at some business without looking for imaginary racism because you brainwashed them so damn bad.
[02:28:08.644 --> 02:28:11.045]  Look what you did to them.
[02:28:11.045 --> 02:28:12.946]  How you pimped them.
[02:28:12.946 --> 02:28:19.950]  It's like that HBO show about pimps and she's been run over, she's been hit, she's dying and she's like, baby, I'm gonna get back on the street, I'm gonna get back on the street.
[02:28:19.950 --> 02:28:21.471]  He's like, you better, baby.
[02:28:21.471 --> 02:28:25.233]  And her mother goes, look what you did to my baby.
[02:28:25.233 --> 02:28:27.575]  Totally pimped out, totally brainwashed.
[02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:35.872]  And just believe that all these people are out to get you, and the very ones out to get you are the ones telling you all that.
[02:28:35.872 --> 02:28:38.434]  It's unbelievable!
[02:28:38.434 --> 02:28:41.596]  And it makes me sick!
[02:28:41.596 --> 02:28:45.499]  Jussie Smollett could face new charges if Special Prosecutor steps in.
[02:28:45.499 --> 02:28:47.840]  It's on InfoWars.com by Kit Daniels.
[02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:48.241]  Get it out.
[02:28:55.276 --> 02:29:06.466]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:06.466 --> 02:29:13.353]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:29:13.473 --> 02:29:13.793]  I think so.
[02:29:36.598 --> 02:29:38.580]  Go to MyOwnPowerGrid.com

[02:30:56.089 --> 02:30:58.751]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[02:30:58.751 --> 02:31:00.552]  We're going into the season of war.
[02:31:00.552 --> 02:31:06.635]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[02:31:06.635 --> 02:31:10.297]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[02:31:10.297 --> 02:31:11.218]  We need to end here.
[02:31:11.218 --> 02:31:12.538]  We need to be provisioned.
[02:31:12.538 --> 02:31:13.199]  And you've got my
[02:31:13.499 --> 02:31:17.140]  Total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:21.002]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[02:31:21.002 --> 02:31:22.922]  I'm bloodying them up politically.
[02:31:22.922 --> 02:31:27.904]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[02:31:27.904 --> 02:31:31.205]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[02:31:31.205 --> 02:31:32.045]  I need gas.
[02:31:32.045 --> 02:31:33.526]  I need ammo politically now.
[02:31:33.966 --> 02:31:40.270]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[02:31:40.270 --> 02:31:41.391]  We're unstoppable together.
[02:31:41.391 --> 02:31:42.792]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[02:31:42.792 --> 02:31:49.836]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[02:31:49.836 --> 02:31:50.817]  You have my commitment.
[02:31:50.817 --> 02:31:55.160]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[02:31:56.946 --> 02:32:01.272]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[02:32:01.272 --> 02:32:08.922]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[02:32:08.922 --> 02:32:11.786]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[02:32:11.986 --> 02:32:12.887]  We're good to go.
[02:32:31.599 --> 02:32:32.539]  I like to be expanding.
[02:32:32.539 --> 02:32:33.320]  I like to be winning.
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:34.040]  I like to be fighting.
[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:35.221]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[02:32:35.221 --> 02:32:36.101]  That's why we're so hated.
[02:32:36.101 --> 02:32:37.722]  But we need to be retreaded.
[02:32:37.722 --> 02:32:38.922]  We need to be tuned up.
[02:32:38.922 --> 02:32:40.003]  We need to be fixed up.
[02:32:40.003 --> 02:32:41.323]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[02:32:41.323 --> 02:32:42.844]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[02:32:42.844 --> 02:32:47.706]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[02:32:47.706 --> 02:32:49.707]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[02:32:49.707 --> 02:32:53.989]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[02:32:53.989 --> 02:32:55.630]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[02:32:58.729 --> 02:33:08.216]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:08.216 --> 02:33:09.396]  Big Brother.
[02:33:09.396 --> 02:33:11.198]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:11.198 --> 02:33:13.119]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:13.119 --> 02:33:14.780]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:14.780 --> 02:33:16.461]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:16.461 --> 02:33:20.964]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.305 --> 02:33:29.386]  Hard to turn off.
[02:33:29.386 --> 02:33:30.026]  Steppenwolf.
[02:33:30.026 --> 02:33:30.887]  Let's get serious.
[02:33:30.887 --> 02:33:40.754]  Owen Troyer is here with me and I'll host a little bit the next hour and then the great
[02:33:57.833 --> 02:34:01.018]  Dr. Nick Begich is going to be taking over on this Friday edition.
[02:34:01.018 --> 02:34:02.039]  I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:34:04.707 --> 02:34:06.548]  There could be war at any time.
[02:34:06.548 --> 02:34:10.990]  Ben Shapiro upset that Trump didn't order the slaughter of hundreds of people for no reason.
[02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:13.052]  That's the latest Paul Joseph Watson article.
[02:34:13.052 --> 02:34:25.038]  There's an article going up soon with the FBI letter to us that we didn't commit any crimes, that we were the victim, and telling us to destroy the child porn that we were emailed by leftists trying to set us up off our servers.
[02:34:25.038 --> 02:34:28.080]  All of that, other big retractions, we've got
[02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:35.103]  Raw story coming out and saying Alex Jones did not say Jew boy on his show about lawyers.
[02:34:35.103 --> 02:34:35.783]  It's all made up.
[02:34:35.783 --> 02:34:38.465]  I said white shoe boy.
[02:34:38.465 --> 02:34:40.025]  White shoe boy.
[02:34:40.025 --> 02:34:42.607]  Which means a Yale lawyer.
[02:34:42.607 --> 02:34:43.947]  A Yale blue blood.
[02:34:43.947 --> 02:34:45.828]  A Yale wasp.
[02:34:45.828 --> 02:34:50.570]  White Anglo-Saxon Protestant is the definition of it.
[02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:51.311]  And I'm not bashing
[02:34:52.091 --> 02:34:52.851]  Wasp of that.
[02:34:52.851 --> 02:35:05.116]  It's just a particular local parlance in the vernacular to show my extreme spectrum of semantical information.
[02:35:05.116 --> 02:35:08.998]  Now, we're going to talk to Owen though about the latest hoax.
[02:35:08.998 --> 02:35:18.262]  Did he say, hang Barack Hussein, the long-legged mac daddy, Obama?
[02:35:18.262 --> 02:35:21.603]  Newsweek runs headline claiming Owen Schroeder called for Obama's lynching
[02:35:22.824 --> 02:35:24.565]  But doesn't show you where he said it.
[02:35:24.565 --> 02:35:26.347]  So, we'll talk about that.
[02:35:26.347 --> 02:35:28.928]  Of course, put a picture of my goofy face up there.
[02:35:28.928 --> 02:35:30.069]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[02:35:30.069 --> 02:35:35.553]  But first, in this orgy of lies, there's still the North Star of Truth.
[02:35:35.553 --> 02:35:36.214]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:37.182 --> 02:35:41.265]  Don't let the globalists win and get great products you already need.
[02:35:41.265 --> 02:35:53.332]  As much as I work and as much stress as I'm under, if I didn't take the high-quality fish oil or the turmeric, my knee and my back and all the things I've been injured doing things over the years would be untenable.
[02:35:53.332 --> 02:35:54.112]  They're great products.
[02:35:54.112 --> 02:35:57.614]  They're all 50% off store-wide at m4store.com.
[02:35:57.614 --> 02:36:01.097]  Store-wide, free shipping, 50% off, double pay for your points.
[02:36:01.097 --> 02:36:03.998]  That sale's got to end early next week.
[02:36:03.998 --> 02:36:05.539]  It'll still be a sale on some items.
[02:36:07.597 --> 02:36:09.858]  Some things like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:36:09.858 --> 02:36:10.718]  People already love that.
[02:36:10.718 --> 02:36:11.558]  It's one of our best sellers.
[02:36:11.558 --> 02:36:12.959]  That's selling out.
[02:36:12.959 --> 02:36:14.979]  X2, that I got a big shipment of.
[02:36:14.979 --> 02:36:16.339]  It's starting to sell out.
[02:36:16.339 --> 02:36:18.440]  Super Mel Vitality, it's starting to sell out.
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:20.301]  Rain Force Plus, it's starting to sell out.
[02:36:20.301 --> 02:36:22.501]  We got a big shipment into the 8-pack Power Stack.
[02:36:22.501 --> 02:36:24.802]  Learn about that Total Body, Total Support.
[02:36:24.802 --> 02:36:26.282]  It's a great gift as well.
[02:36:26.282 --> 02:36:27.022]  We got plenty of that.
[02:36:27.022 --> 02:36:28.283]  It just came in.
[02:36:28.283 --> 02:36:30.603]  We just got Turbo Force Plus, sold out for months.
[02:36:30.603 --> 02:36:35.805]  10-hour clean, healthy energy with all your vitamins, all your minerals, amino acids, and
[02:36:36.445 --> 02:36:43.331]  Five different types of healthy caffeine and a bunch of other natural boosters that time release.
[02:36:43.331 --> 02:36:48.536]  We had to pay a top company a lot of money to give us this formula just for the caffeine release.
[02:36:48.536 --> 02:36:50.578]  This is, this is about, it's over 10 hours.
[02:36:50.578 --> 02:36:52.920]  One releases in the first two.
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:54.721]  One releases within 15 minutes, last two hours.
[02:36:54.721 --> 02:36:57.384]  The other will last about four hours, up to 10 hours.
[02:36:57.384 --> 02:36:59.506]  Clean burn, nothing else like it.
[02:37:00.677 --> 02:37:10.460]  We've got TurboForce back in stock, we've got the great Protein Bars, highest quality back in stock, all of it 50% off, same info wars, special.
[02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:16.902]  Get the apparel, get the books, get the videos, whatever you do, just stuff you need to buy, get it there and know it stands to defy the globalists.
[02:37:16.902 --> 02:37:18.383]  Thank you for your support.
[02:37:18.383 --> 02:37:22.264]  Again, we could not do it without you, but don't let them win.
[02:37:22.264 --> 02:37:25.005]  So Owen, it came out.
[02:37:26.428 --> 02:37:30.371]  That Obama, we'll just tell people what you said and we'll play the clip.
[02:37:30.371 --> 02:37:32.792]  And you were very clear, we don't want anything to happen to Obama.
[02:37:32.792 --> 02:37:34.493]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[02:37:34.493 --> 02:37:37.895]  We don't want anything to happen to them except a court of law.
[02:37:37.895 --> 02:37:40.177]  They say Trump's involved in treason.
[02:37:40.177 --> 02:37:42.158]  They all over the news say they want to kill him.
[02:37:42.158 --> 02:37:43.179]  They say they're going to shoot him.
[02:37:43.179 --> 02:37:44.299]  They don't get in trouble.
[02:37:44.299 --> 02:37:46.461]  We are calling for cooler Hezbollah.
[02:37:46.461 --> 02:37:47.782]  We don't want violence.
[02:37:47.782 --> 02:37:55.707]  But, Huffington Post, all of them, InfoWars host calls Obama treasonous ads, find the tallest tree and rope.
[02:37:57.071 --> 02:38:04.316]  So, there you go, Owen, and now they're calling for you, your name, your face to be banned everywhere.
[02:38:04.316 --> 02:38:12.222]  So, they can do it and be clear about it, you can do it, as part of a question saying we don't want him to get hurt, but what is the punishment for treason?
[02:38:12.222 --> 02:38:12.763]  Tell us about it.
[02:38:13.442 --> 02:38:19.303]  Well, normally I just kind of catch the after flack of the target Alex Jones.
[02:38:19.303 --> 02:38:24.084]  And so normally I'm just kind of catching the flack that comes after Alex takes the brute of it.
[02:38:24.084 --> 02:38:30.946]  But now I'm definitely being targeted and I think they've... Well, your average video when you were still on YouTube had like 10 million views.
[02:38:30.946 --> 02:38:32.166]  Of course they're scared of you, Owen.
[02:38:32.166 --> 02:38:33.886]  Well... Looked like Abraham Lincoln.
[02:38:33.886 --> 02:38:36.587]  My God, the Democrats fear Abraham Lincoln.
[02:38:36.587 --> 02:38:37.767]  It's true.
[02:38:37.767 --> 02:38:38.647]  I did free the slaves.
[02:38:38.647 --> 02:38:39.927]  The Democrats hated me back then.
[02:38:39.927 --> 02:38:41.668]  Now they hate me again because I'm trying to free the people.
[02:38:43.410 --> 02:38:46.293]  They even quote in here what I actually said in some of these articles.
[02:38:46.293 --> 02:38:49.035]  I say, I'm not saying this should happen.
[02:38:49.035 --> 02:38:51.157]  They even quote it, but of course they run the headline.
[02:38:51.157 --> 02:38:52.178]  So now I'm definitely a target.
[02:38:52.178 --> 02:38:53.500]  It looks like Alex Jones and child porn.
[02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:54.401]  Actually, they sent it to him.
[02:38:54.401 --> 02:38:54.861]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:54.861 --> 02:38:55.722]  But that's like the bottom paragraph.
[02:38:55.722 --> 02:38:57.504]  But the headline, because I know everybody reads the headline.
[02:38:58.228 --> 02:39:03.710]  But I think that they've tied it out, Alex, because they hit me with a Twitter suspension about 48 hours ago or now.
[02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:05.770]  Before this, he couldn't stop.
[02:39:05.770 --> 02:39:12.833]  So boom, they hit me with a Twitter suspension, and then they published dozens of articles on Inquisitor, Newsweek, Huffington Post, Yahoo shares it, and everything.
[02:39:13.846 --> 02:39:15.248]  And it's all perfectly timed out.
[02:39:15.248 --> 02:39:17.049]  I'm sure it's not a coincidence.
[02:39:17.049 --> 02:39:18.791]  And again, though, we can play the clip.
[02:39:18.791 --> 02:39:19.972]  We're not banned on Subscribestar.
[02:39:19.972 --> 02:39:22.495]  And this is like, listen, we're barely getting the funding to keep going.
[02:39:22.495 --> 02:39:23.576]  We appreciate everybody.
[02:39:23.576 --> 02:39:27.560]  I'm getting all the hosts and people to start their own Subscribestars, to start your own websites.
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:30.083]  And you get enough money, your own crew, your own companies.
[02:39:30.083 --> 02:39:34.127]  The answer is, I've gotten Paul to finally get it, is to replicate, is to expand.
[02:39:34.127 --> 02:39:35.949]  So they can get other people online.
[02:39:36.249 --> 02:39:38.192]  Subscribestar.com forward slash Alex Jones.
[02:39:38.192 --> 02:39:39.094]  Make a donation.
[02:39:39.094 --> 02:39:40.917]  That way we get 95% of the money, not 20%.
[02:39:40.917 --> 02:39:43.541]  How can we sell a product at such low prices?
[02:39:44.238 --> 02:39:51.721]  So this is why, obviously, we do have to support ourselves within Forrestore and we are launching new things because we know we're a target for destruction.
[02:39:51.721 --> 02:39:53.162]  We don't want the mothership to go down.
[02:39:53.162 --> 02:39:54.723]  Oh my God, I mean, yeah, yeah.
[02:39:54.723 --> 02:40:02.326]  We're fighting so far, we've handled two and a half years of this, but the truth is, we have children because we know we're not going to live forever and we love humanity.
[02:40:02.326 --> 02:40:03.346]  It's the same thing.
[02:40:03.346 --> 02:40:08.469]  So I can say that people like Owen and Paul Watson are not my biological children, but in a way I've been a mentor.
[02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:09.989]  You've also helped me, you've been a mentor.
[02:40:09.989 --> 02:40:11.870]  That's how it works, but that's what this is about.
[02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:13.411]  So let's get back to your great evil.
[02:40:14.983 --> 02:40:21.528]  Let's go to the clip though because I made it very clear in my statement because we know what they say about Trump.
[02:40:21.528 --> 02:40:22.649]  They're just totally untethered.
[02:40:22.649 --> 02:40:23.930]  They'll say anything.
[02:40:23.930 --> 02:40:28.413]  I know that if I come out and I say something directly about Obama that they'll attack me like this.
[02:40:28.413 --> 02:40:31.035]  So I'm making sure to say, no, we don't want violence to happen.
[02:40:31.035 --> 02:40:32.897]  Like you were saying, we don't want Obama to be a martyr.
[02:40:32.897 --> 02:40:34.398]  But they're engaged in treason.
[02:40:34.398 --> 02:40:34.878]  Wow.
[02:40:34.878 --> 02:40:35.799]  So here's the clip.
[02:40:35.799 --> 02:40:36.360]  Yeah, here's the clip.
[02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:41.405]  Folks, Obama was emailing Hillary Clinton on her illegal server under a secret name.
[02:40:41.405 --> 02:40:45.148]  That came out in emails, and he claimed that he didn't know she had it.
[02:40:45.148 --> 02:40:49.573]  Barack Obama is a treasonous... He belongs in jail!
[02:40:49.573 --> 02:40:51.415]  He belongs in Guantanamo Bay!
[02:40:51.415 --> 02:40:58.102]  I mean, look, I'm not saying this should happen, but Barack Obama, you know, find the tallest tree and a rope.
[02:40:59.102 --> 02:41:04.224]  New Clinton email review reveals multiple security incidents.
[02:41:04.224 --> 02:41:08.266]  Again, this is becoming another Judicial Watch dump.
[02:41:08.266 --> 02:41:11.608]  So that's the clip right there, Alex.
[02:41:11.608 --> 02:41:13.929]  And I notice most of the articles don't even have the video.
[02:41:13.929 --> 02:41:15.229]  No, none of them have the video.
[02:41:15.229 --> 02:41:15.789]  So none of them.
[02:41:15.789 --> 02:41:16.490]  They won't show.
[02:41:16.490 --> 02:41:18.491]  It's like when they said I call people Jewboy.
[02:41:18.491 --> 02:41:20.391]  They won't show it because I didn't say it.
[02:41:20.391 --> 02:41:21.152]  And here's the point.
[02:41:21.152 --> 02:41:23.513]  Here's the context of the clip that they'll never actually cover.
[02:41:24.076 --> 02:41:27.179]  Barack Obama committed treason!
[02:41:27.179 --> 02:41:29.161]  That's your headline!
[02:41:29.161 --> 02:41:33.325]  Not Owen Schroyer, Infowars host, says Obama committed treason.
[02:41:33.325 --> 02:41:33.786]  No!
[02:41:33.786 --> 02:41:35.988]  The headline is Obama committed treason!
[02:41:35.988 --> 02:41:37.089]  That's the headline, Alex!
[02:41:37.089 --> 02:41:37.910]  They still don't get it!
[02:41:39.793 --> 02:41:43.075]  So what do we call this video when we post it up to InfoWars, our own video streams?
[02:41:43.075 --> 02:41:44.376]  That's right, because they're trying to shut us down.
[02:41:44.376 --> 02:41:51.140]  I mean, how do you even, like, like, like, media hoax claims Owen Schroyer calls for Obama to be hung.
[02:41:51.140 --> 02:41:54.102]  Well, I've never, I never said the words hang or lynched.
[02:41:54.102 --> 02:41:56.383]  So those are the words that they're inserting into this story.
[02:41:56.383 --> 02:41:58.965]  But again, it even says, you can look at this.
[02:42:00.229 --> 02:42:03.010]  I'm not saying this should happen.
[02:42:03.010 --> 02:42:05.191]  I'm not saying this should happen.
[02:42:17.045 --> 02:42:21.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, they even then, they retweeted it to get you banned.
[02:42:21.107 --> 02:42:22.528]  Yeah, they quote me on Twitter!
[02:42:22.528 --> 02:42:23.928]  With fake quotes.
[02:42:23.928 --> 02:42:24.789]  With edited quotes.
[02:42:24.789 --> 02:42:26.590]  So, it's next level fraud.
[02:42:26.590 --> 02:42:28.090]  I forgot about that aspect.
[02:42:28.090 --> 02:42:36.895]  So now I get suspended from Twitter for something I never said on Twitter and the guy that put the exact quote of what I said not on Twitter gets me suspended and he's still on Twitter.
[02:42:38.052 --> 02:42:39.553]  But there's no bias, Alex.
[02:42:39.553 --> 02:42:41.214]  Why are they coming after us so much?
[02:42:41.214 --> 02:42:42.815]  The audience gets it.
[02:42:42.815 --> 02:42:45.557]  Because we're promoting Americana, we're defeating the globalists.
[02:42:45.557 --> 02:42:46.938]  How do you defeat them?
[02:42:46.938 --> 02:42:48.059]  Spread it word of mouth.
[02:42:48.059 --> 02:42:49.319]  The forbidden show.
[02:42:49.319 --> 02:42:50.240]  Tell everyone.
[02:42:50.240 --> 02:42:51.261]  InfoWars.com.
[02:42:58.172 --> 02:43:00.034]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:00.034 --> 02:43:03.898]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:03.898 --> 02:43:05.339]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:05.339 --> 02:43:07.761]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:07.761 --> 02:43:10.083]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:10.083 --> 02:43:14.087]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:14.087 --> 02:43:16.529]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:17.390 --> 02:43:20.072]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:20.072 --> 02:43:21.433]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:21.433 --> 02:43:22.533]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:22.533 --> 02:43:24.014]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:24.014 --> 02:43:25.095]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:25.095 --> 02:43:26.456]  Put him on pause again.
[02:43:26.456 --> 02:43:27.296]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:27.296 --> 02:43:32.960]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:37.483]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:37.483 --> 02:43:40.625]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:40.625 --> 02:43:41.085]  You understand?
[02:43:41.085 --> 02:43:42.726]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:42.726 --> 02:43:43.846]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:44.827 --> 02:43:50.437]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:43:50.437 --> 02:43:51.178]  Do you understand?
[02:43:51.178 --> 02:43:52.801]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:52.801 --> 02:43:54.263]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:43:54.850 --> 02:44:00.051]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:44:00.051 --> 02:44:08.613]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:44:08.613 --> 02:44:11.614]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:44:11.614 --> 02:44:13.334]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:44:13.334 --> 02:44:19.616]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[02:44:30.001 --> 02:44:33.583]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:44:33.583 --> 02:44:37.906]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:44:37.906 --> 02:44:39.727]  I've got two in my home.
[02:44:39.727 --> 02:44:45.831]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:44:45.831 --> 02:44:46.672]  Don't live
[02:44:47.492 --> 02:44:51.555]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[02:44:51.555 --> 02:44:52.816]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.

[02:45:14.377 --> 02:45:24.462]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:45:24.462 --> 02:45:32.986]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.

[02:45:35.168 --> 02:45:36.329]  You must experience it.
[02:45:36.329 --> 02:45:38.271]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:45:38.271 --> 02:45:43.336]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:45:43.336 --> 02:45:44.858]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:45:44.858 --> 02:45:46.320]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:53.027]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[02:46:59.682 --> 02:47:02.287]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:41.988 --> 02:47:49.071]  So what is it the establishment, Owen Troyer, is so afraid of?
[02:47:49.071 --> 02:47:52.092]  Where they engage in all this and what are they building towards?
[02:47:52.092 --> 02:47:56.174]  You know, I know nationalism is exploding, populism is exploding.
[02:47:56.174 --> 02:47:59.455]  The globalists recognize that they can't stop it and I think Trump means well overall.
[02:48:00.785 --> 02:48:10.771]  He's been stopping these fake wars, but if he doesn't take action against the censorship, if he doesn't start breaking up big tech like he said he would do, every week he waits.
[02:48:10.771 --> 02:48:14.173]  They get more arrogant, more out of control while paying him lip service.
[02:48:14.173 --> 02:48:15.574]  Oh my gosh.
[02:48:15.574 --> 02:48:17.295]  I opened the phones up 15-20 minutes ago.
[02:48:17.295 --> 02:48:24.919]  We're going to go to some calls starting here with Carlos and Johnny and Todd and Marcos and Brandon and Chase and Lou and Steve.
[02:48:24.919 --> 02:48:29.002]  We'll get to those calls and then the great Nick Begich will take over about 15 after next hour.
[02:48:32.241 --> 02:48:37.806]  Again, it's not about us, it's the fact that the lies, like they even said that Trump
[02:48:38.848 --> 02:48:44.150]  I just hope that the boldness and the openness of these lies is waking people up to who these people really are.
[02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:48.332]  They're not your friends, and they're not honest people, and you should not trust them for anything.
[02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:16.768]  But I just look at what's happened to me here and you can see it's the same thing that they do to you, Alex, where they say, oh, it's just a coincidence that Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and everybody banned Alex Jones in the same week.
[02:49:16.768 --> 02:49:18.109]  That's just a coincidence.
[02:49:18.109 --> 02:49:18.970]  Nothing to see here.
[02:49:18.970 --> 02:49:19.970]  No collusion.
[02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:26.735]  Just like it's a coincidence that for the first time since I guess they think that they've totally destroyed you by faking news that you sent child porn.
[02:49:26.735 --> 02:49:29.117]  I guess that they really thought that was going to bring you down.
[02:49:29.117 --> 02:49:32.419]  They figured that it's time to not just hit me with the flack.
[02:49:32.819 --> 02:49:38.622]  Mrs. Alex Jones, and they just target me, so they... I'm already off Facebook and YouTube, I've been banned there for a while.
[02:49:38.622 --> 02:49:40.623]  But I still had Twitter, so they suspended me on Twitter.
[02:49:40.623 --> 02:49:43.445]  I had to double appeal.
[02:49:43.445 --> 02:49:46.506]  I got suspended for a tweet that read, what's the punishment for treason?
[02:49:46.506 --> 02:49:50.108]  Because that's what I'm covering in this segment that they're all freaking out about.
[02:49:50.108 --> 02:49:52.770]  The fact that Barack Obama committed treason, and I've got the U.S.
[02:49:52.770 --> 02:49:54.610]  Code right here, 18 U.S.
[02:49:54.610 --> 02:49:58.052]  Code, subsection 2381, and the punishment for treason is death.
[02:50:01.561 --> 02:50:04.524]  If you are guilty of treason, you shall suffer death.
[02:50:04.524 --> 02:50:06.986]  So that's just in the code.
[02:50:06.986 --> 02:50:14.532]  So I'm just alluding to the fact that Obama committed treason and that punishment for treason is death, but I didn't say that on Twitter.
[02:50:14.532 --> 02:50:23.861]  I won't even say this guy's name because he's so pathetic that I feel like I might lower my IQ and my vitality just by saying his name.
[02:50:25.407 --> 02:50:29.409]  He actually quotes me on Twitter, what I never said on Twitter.
[02:50:29.409 --> 02:50:38.792]  He quotes what I said on Twitter, targets me for flagging, and then I get suspended from Twitter for a tweet that reads, what's the punishment for treason?
[02:50:38.792 --> 02:50:46.475]  But the guy who actually gives the exact quote of what I said, which is what they're suspending me for, doesn't get suspended.
[02:50:46.475 --> 02:50:48.756]  Now, to answer the question about Trump and big tech,
[02:50:51.072 --> 02:51:00.423]  You know, Alex, maybe he thinks he's so popular now with these rally numbers and everything, he doesn't think he needs to address big tech, but he needs to not think about it from getting himself re-elected.
[02:51:00.423 --> 02:51:01.524]  He needs to do his damn job.
[02:51:01.524 --> 02:51:06.129]  And which I know, he says he's going after him, I believe it, but he'll give the orders, they just ignore him.
[02:51:06.129 --> 02:51:06.890]  They brag about that.
[02:51:07.130 --> 02:51:12.114]  Well, the good news is Josh Hawley from Missouri, which by the way, there are now zero abortion clinics in Missouri.
[02:51:12.114 --> 02:51:14.896]  That's right, you're from Missouri, he was the first to go after Google years ago.
[02:51:14.896 --> 02:51:15.977]  Tell us about this badass.
[02:51:15.977 --> 02:51:23.163]  So, so Hawley, former Attorney General... I meant to talk about that more the other day, because he says he's going after him and he's going to strip 230 from him.
[02:51:23.163 --> 02:51:24.724]  He's going to do everything he can.
[02:51:24.724 --> 02:51:26.606]  He's committed... Their immunity is what they live off of.
[02:51:26.866 --> 02:51:29.028]  And so he's committed to using anything he can.
[02:51:29.028 --> 02:51:30.509]  He comes from a legal background.
[02:51:30.509 --> 02:51:33.252]  So he's going to do anything he can to try to break them up.
[02:51:33.252 --> 02:51:36.175]  And now he's in Congress and bringing this to the Hill all the time.
[02:51:36.175 --> 02:51:40.739]  He's not getting much help because he's one of the few that doesn't take money from these big tech companies.
[02:51:40.739 --> 02:51:42.280]  By the way, I meant to play that on Monday.
[02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:42.681]  I should have.
[02:51:42.681 --> 02:51:43.421]  I should have played that.
[02:51:43.421 --> 02:51:46.064]  But yeah, if you want to get attacked, do what Josh Hawley's doing.
[02:51:46.064 --> 02:51:47.105]  He's got the big huevos.
[02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:49.805]  But you can clearly see the collusion here, Alex.
[02:51:49.805 --> 02:52:00.993]  I mean, it's not a coincidence that I'm suspended from Twitter and then they write dozens of headlines about me where they clearly aren't... I mean, they're not honest about what I said, they're not putting the context into it, and they're missing the headline, which is, Barack Obama committed treason.
[02:52:00.993 --> 02:52:02.554]  The punishment for treason is death.
[02:52:02.554 --> 02:52:03.995]  That's the headline.
[02:52:03.995 --> 02:52:07.637]  But this is about now targeting... So what do we call this interview, though?
[02:52:11.684 --> 02:52:12.985]  We're gonna post this.
[02:52:12.985 --> 02:52:18.229]  The magnitude is, you know, MSM hoax claims Owen Schroeder said, hang Obama.
[02:52:18.229 --> 02:52:19.310]  That's not even the issue.
[02:52:19.310 --> 02:52:24.434]  The thing is, MSM hoax distracts from Obama's treason.
[02:52:24.434 --> 02:52:27.837]  Ignores Obama's treason, focuses on hating free speech.
[02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:30.419]  Obama hanging story hoax.
[02:52:30.419 --> 02:52:32.161]  No, no, no.
[02:52:32.161 --> 02:52:39.567]  The left, media attacks free speech instead of treason by Obama.
[02:52:40.612 --> 02:52:41.713]  Yeah.
[02:52:41.713 --> 02:52:42.794]  That's what these people are doing.
[02:52:42.794 --> 02:52:43.294]  Let's go further.
[02:52:43.294 --> 02:52:43.894]  Let me show people this.
[02:52:43.894 --> 02:52:45.496]  We're going to go to phone calls.
[02:52:45.496 --> 02:52:50.739]  Let me show people this Ted Cruz video.
[02:52:50.739 --> 02:52:54.502]  I'm showing you the YouTube screenshot.
[02:52:54.502 --> 02:53:05.730]  Yesterday morning, he goes on the Washington Post live feed, talks trash about me, says things I didn't say, but then says I have a right to say it in defense of the First Amendment.
[02:53:05.730 --> 02:53:07.812]  Okay, I'll take that backhanded defense.
[02:53:10.023 --> 02:53:10.983]  Okay.
[02:53:10.983 --> 02:53:12.164]  Ted's beard looks good, by the way.
[02:53:12.164 --> 02:53:14.084]  He's getting a little fat, though, like me.
[02:53:14.084 --> 02:53:19.366]  So, the live feed has 49 viewers.
[02:53:19.366 --> 02:53:20.386]  Since then, it has 336.
[02:53:20.386 --> 02:53:27.008]  Our video on InfoWars that we posted has like 20,000, last time I checked.
[02:53:27.008 --> 02:53:32.690]  So, our own platform has 20,000 views of Ted Cruz lies about Alex Jones, but still defends free speech.
[02:53:32.690 --> 02:53:38.412]  Now, every comment, almost every comment, is anti-Trump.
[02:53:40.236 --> 02:53:40.716]  Ted Cruz.
[02:53:40.716 --> 02:53:47.760]  So the whole Washington Post, fun about Jeff Bezos, has 300 and something views after a huge conference and a huge fee.
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:51.302]  They don't show the conference because nobody's there.
[02:53:51.302 --> 02:54:00.867]  First comment by Anthony LDS says, only crime he committed was getting a nationalist elected.
[02:54:00.867 --> 02:54:03.228]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[02:54:03.228 --> 02:54:04.468]  Another commenter, Chris, says,
[02:54:05.632 --> 02:54:10.394]  At least one politician has some bleeping balls, thank God Almighty, defending free speech.
[02:54:10.394 --> 02:54:16.957]  So, lying Ted Cruz just as mad at Alex Jones, got Donald Trump elected as president on him.
[02:54:16.957 --> 02:54:25.181]  But Alex Jones definitely helped lying Ted hold on to his Senate seat over Robert O'Rourke.
[02:54:25.181 --> 02:54:30.223]  From lying Ted back to lying Ted, he's one hell of a liar, folks.
[02:54:32.281 --> 02:54:34.883]  This next person says he's right, we should defend free speech.
[02:54:34.883 --> 02:54:35.924]  Amen!
[02:54:35.924 --> 02:54:43.230]  Not a fan of Ted Cruz from the perspective of being a Democrat, but I'm a fan of him that he seems that he is a force for good to the Republican Party.
[02:54:43.230 --> 02:54:47.193]  And then it just goes on, but most of the comments here are against him.
[02:54:47.193 --> 02:54:47.734]  Ted looked
[02:54:49.565 --> 02:54:51.166]  I can't understand what this person's typing.
[02:54:51.166 --> 02:54:53.828]  Beta male, cuck, host.
[02:54:53.828 --> 02:54:55.289]  I'm not saying that, they're saying it.
[02:54:55.289 --> 02:55:00.552]  Washington Post is trash, Democrat Party treats us like scum, Alex Jones is the bleep, make America great again.
[02:55:00.552 --> 02:55:03.154]  And it just goes on to defend me.
[02:55:03.154 --> 02:55:04.975]  I mean, it's like 95% positive towards us.
[02:55:06.903 --> 02:55:09.364]  Ted, no one believes the Washington Post.
[02:55:09.364 --> 02:55:14.006]  Kissing their butt, licking their butt is not going to help you, man.
[02:55:14.006 --> 02:55:14.946]  Just stop it.
[02:55:14.946 --> 02:55:15.546]  Go ahead.
[02:55:15.546 --> 02:55:16.767]  You know what I'd like to find out?
[02:55:16.767 --> 02:55:23.989]  I'd like to find out what communications the heads of these big tech, big social media companies are having with Democrats.
[02:55:23.989 --> 02:55:25.089]  We know they met with Obama.
[02:55:25.089 --> 02:55:26.070]  We know they meet with Obama.
[02:55:26.070 --> 02:55:30.371]  Are they also meeting with Schumer and Pelosi and Waters and Schiff?
[02:55:30.371 --> 02:55:34.633]  I want to know if Ted Cruz... I'm not going to say it.
[02:55:35.401 --> 02:55:35.942]  I'm proud of him.
[02:55:35.942 --> 02:55:41.392]  You don't want to know, Alex, but what you really want to know is... I want to know... Sorry.
[02:55:41.392 --> 02:55:46.260]  Are the Democrats ordering these big tech companies to target conservatives for censorship?
[02:55:46.701 --> 02:55:47.762]  Well, it's all known.
[02:55:47.762 --> 02:55:48.262]  It's admitted.
[02:55:48.262 --> 02:55:49.263]  We have all their internal emails.
[02:55:49.263 --> 02:55:50.123]  We have them.
[02:55:50.123 --> 02:55:51.404]  Alright, I promise.
[02:55:51.404 --> 02:55:52.685]  You get ready for your show.
[02:55:52.685 --> 02:55:54.506]  We're going to take calls the next two segments.
[02:55:54.506 --> 02:55:55.547]  I'm going to get to every one of you.
[02:55:55.547 --> 02:56:01.511]  Carlos, Johnny, Chase the Patriot, Brandon, Marcos, Todd, Steve, Johnny, Lee, Lou.
[02:56:01.511 --> 02:56:04.653]  I've got to call up the caller coming in here from my lawyer.
[02:56:04.653 --> 02:56:06.915]  Hey Norm, I'm sure it's wonderful whatever's happening.
[02:56:06.915 --> 02:56:08.796]  Let me talk to you in 60 seconds when I go to break, okay?
[02:56:08.956 --> 02:56:12.038]  You know what's funny though, Alex?
[02:56:12.038 --> 02:56:12.939]  They've already gone for your jugular.
[02:56:12.939 --> 02:56:14.901]  They're trying to attack me in Connecticut right now.
[02:56:14.901 --> 02:56:20.305]  They tried to go for your jugular, your heart, your brain, your arms, your limbs, everything.
[02:56:20.305 --> 02:56:23.708]  Now they're going after your phalanges.
[02:56:23.708 --> 02:56:25.689]  They want your soul!
[02:56:25.689 --> 02:56:27.751]  Meanwhile, we're the ones fighting all their evil.
[02:56:27.751 --> 02:56:28.972]  They want your soul, Alex!
[02:56:28.972 --> 02:56:29.733]  They're trying to protect it.
[02:56:29.733 --> 02:56:30.213]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:56:30.213 --> 02:56:32.515]  I'm sure you've been in a couple of fights, Owen.
[02:56:34.642 --> 02:56:36.243]  Once you get in the fight, you're not scared anymore.
[02:56:36.243 --> 02:56:38.004]  How do you think I lost this tooth?
[02:56:38.004 --> 02:56:38.545]  Exactly.
[02:56:38.545 --> 02:56:39.906]  I think you got your new one though.
[02:56:39.906 --> 02:56:41.127]  That's a couple of months.
[02:56:41.127 --> 02:56:42.408]  You still have surgery?
[02:56:42.408 --> 02:56:42.568]  Mm-hmm.
[02:56:42.568 --> 02:56:45.370]  I sent my stitches out a couple days ago.
[02:56:45.370 --> 02:56:46.150]  Talk about lying.
[02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.671]  I'm not doing it.
[02:56:46.671 --> 02:56:47.471]  I'm not taking it out.
[02:56:47.471 --> 02:56:47.772]  John Ronson.
[02:56:47.772 --> 02:56:48.472]  I'm not going to try.
[02:56:48.472 --> 02:56:52.695]  Alex, I want to come in and interview you about what interesting stories we had.
[02:56:52.695 --> 02:56:53.636]  They got all the real stories.
[02:56:55.034 --> 02:56:58.977]  And then they just made up a story that I got tied up because I was a bully and all my teeth knocked out.
[02:56:58.977 --> 02:57:00.278]  I have every one of my teeth.
[02:57:00.278 --> 02:57:04.921]  None of them have ever been knocked out until one of them broke off from a root canal.
[02:57:04.921 --> 02:57:07.503]  That got pulled by the dentist a month ago.
[02:57:07.503 --> 02:57:09.264]  I offered to give them my medical records.
[02:57:09.264 --> 02:57:11.806]  They go, oh, we don't want those, Alex.
[02:57:11.806 --> 02:57:17.250]  So they made up this like Carrie story where I'm getting my teeth knocked out for being a bully.
[02:57:17.250 --> 02:57:19.892]  It's all the left's hallucination.
[02:57:19.892 --> 02:57:22.194]  And they're all fiction writers that failed in Hollywood.
[02:57:23.717 --> 02:57:26.679]  So they want us to buy their delusion.
[02:57:26.679 --> 02:57:28.380]  I wish I could write as good a fiction as that.
[02:57:28.380 --> 02:57:30.281]  I'm trying to just think off the top of my head.
[02:57:30.281 --> 02:57:39.867]  Uh, Alex Jones... Alex Jones escapes with... escapes with caged gorilla in Dallas Zoo and takes him to, uh, Austin, Texas.

[02:59:54.611 --> 02:59:56.552]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[02:59:56.552 --> 03:00:01.333]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[03:00:01.333 --> 03:00:04.934]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[03:00:04.934 --> 03:00:09.135]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[03:00:09.135 --> 03:00:12.275]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[03:00:12.275 --> 03:00:19.417]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[03:00:19.417 --> 03:00:20.017]  Dangerous.
[03:00:20.017 --> 03:00:20.617]  Dangerous.
[03:00:20.617 --> 03:00:21.137]  Dangerous.
[03:00:21.137 --> 03:00:22.298]  Dangerous people.
[03:00:22.298 --> 03:00:23.518]  Dangerous individuals.
[03:00:23.558 --> 03:00:24.639]  Dangerous individuals.
[03:00:24.639 --> 03:00:27.300]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:31.703]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[03:00:31.703 --> 03:00:32.863]  They call me dangerous.
[03:00:32.863 --> 03:00:34.484]  Danger is my middle name.
[03:00:34.484 --> 03:00:36.566]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[03:00:36.566 --> 03:00:39.908]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[03:00:39.908 --> 03:00:44.590]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[03:00:44.590 --> 03:00:46.271]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[03:00:46.271 --> 03:00:50.534]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[03:00:50.854 --> 03:00:53.516]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[03:00:53.516 --> 03:00:55.577]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[03:00:55.577 --> 03:00:58.339]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[03:00:58.339 --> 03:01:00.781]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[03:01:00.781 --> 03:01:01.862]  I want them shut down.
[03:01:01.862 --> 03:01:02.823]  I want them silenced.
[03:01:02.823 --> 03:01:03.663]  I want them muted.
[03:01:03.663 --> 03:01:05.665]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:01:05.665 --> 03:01:07.366]  I want them shut down.
[03:01:07.366 --> 03:01:08.587]  I want them silenced.
[03:01:08.587 --> 03:01:09.488]  I want them muted.
[03:01:09.488 --> 03:01:12.670]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[03:01:14.542 --> 03:01:32.341]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content, and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[03:01:32.381 --> 03:01:36.784]  Screw your rules, your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[03:01:36.784 --> 03:01:43.848]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions, he's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[03:01:43.848 --> 03:01:46.590]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[03:01:46.590 --> 03:01:50.492]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[03:01:50.492 --> 03:01:57.537]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[03:01:57.697 --> 03:01:58.838]  You are a bad person.
[03:01:58.838 --> 03:02:00.258]  You should be censored off the internet.
[03:02:00.258 --> 03:02:01.439]  Bad, yes!
[03:02:01.439 --> 03:02:02.699]  Get out of here, Alex!
[03:02:02.699 --> 03:02:07.201]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[03:02:07.201 --> 03:02:16.305]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[03:02:16.305 --> 03:02:21.887]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:02:21.887 --> 03:02:23.428]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[03:02:24.062 --> 03:02:31.931]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[03:02:31.931 --> 03:02:39.860]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:41.962]  As president, I will make it clear.
[03:02:42.823 --> 03:02:48.127]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[03:02:48.127 --> 03:02:53.551]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[03:02:53.551 --> 03:02:56.954]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[03:02:56.954 --> 03:02:59.976]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[03:02:59.976 --> 03:03:02.538]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:03:04.921 --> 03:03:07.303]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[03:03:07.303 --> 03:03:10.986]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[03:03:10.986 --> 03:03:18.872]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[03:03:20.788 --> 03:03:21.308]  The U.S.
[03:03:21.308 --> 03:03:25.271]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[03:03:25.271 --> 03:03:33.277]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[03:03:33.277 --> 03:03:35.638]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[03:03:35.638 --> 03:03:40.321]  Of course not, because she's... Hang on guys, look, there's a really loud noise.
[03:03:40.321 --> 03:03:44.364]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[03:03:44.364 --> 03:03:46.586]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[03:03:50.447 --> 03:03:54.846]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[03:04:23.397 --> 03:04:34.740]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:37.201]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:04:54.375 --> 03:05:04.241]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[03:05:04.241 --> 03:05:13.267]  The false claim that you purposely sent kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false.
[03:05:13.267 --> 03:05:14.387]  It's a smear.
[03:05:14.387 --> 03:05:16.589]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[03:05:16.589 --> 03:05:18.069]  You don't even open it.
[03:05:18.069 --> 03:05:23.072]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you.
[03:05:24.973 --> 03:05:26.074]  This is bizarre.
[03:05:26.074 --> 03:05:32.295]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say Jones sent kiddie porn is really outrageous.
[03:05:32.295 --> 03:05:37.976]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[03:05:37.976 --> 03:05:39.517]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[03:05:39.517 --> 03:05:40.697]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[03:05:40.697 --> 03:05:42.397]  Where's Associated Press?
[03:05:42.397 --> 03:05:47.959]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[03:05:47.959 --> 03:05:53.400]  So we both need your help, and I urge folks to continue to support InfoWars with your dollars.
[03:05:55.751 --> 03:06:00.577]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:06:00.577 --> 03:06:02.259]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:02.259 --> 03:06:03.921]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:03.921 --> 03:06:08.588]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.042 --> 03:06:22.064]  So, they claim Ellen Schreuer wants to kill Obama.
[03:06:22.064 --> 03:06:23.425]  Didn't say it.
[03:06:23.425 --> 03:06:26.367]  They claim I lost a lawsuit this week for writing a book about Sandy Hook.
[03:06:26.367 --> 03:06:27.108]  Never wrote the book.
[03:06:27.108 --> 03:06:29.029]  Not in it.
[03:06:29.029 --> 03:06:31.971]  They claim I sent child porn.
[03:06:31.971 --> 03:06:36.714]  Paul Watson's got the article going up here in just a few minutes to Infowars.com where the FBI says I'm the victim.
[03:06:36.714 --> 03:06:39.216]  And the letter.
[03:06:39.216 --> 03:06:40.637]  But that's how these people operate.
[03:06:40.637 --> 03:06:46.441]  And their lies and their propaganda just get worse and worse and worse by the minute.
[03:06:47.947 --> 03:06:52.649]  This is the time we live in, and I just got a call from Norm Pattis calling over and over again.
[03:06:52.649 --> 03:06:57.071]  So we need to check on all the InfoWars comments.
[03:06:57.071 --> 03:07:07.736]  Judge Bellis up there says she got called by the state police, she got called by the FBI, that someone on InfoWars made death threats at her.
[03:07:07.736 --> 03:07:13.439]  And of course, that's going to be comments by you-know-who, our little friends.
[03:07:15.066 --> 03:07:20.450]  Remember the internal documents came out a few months ago before I got banned on Facebook?
[03:07:20.450 --> 03:07:22.512]  Democratic Party?
[03:07:22.512 --> 03:07:24.033]  Business Insider?
[03:07:24.033 --> 03:07:35.661]  They said, hey, some of the comments on Alex Jones' Facebook page, that he still has his personal one, that you didn't ban, they say that Alex Jones lets anti-Semitic comments happen.
[03:07:35.661 --> 03:07:41.546]  The internal documents showed 4% of the comments in the article were anti-Semitic, as if that's my fault.
[03:07:41.546 --> 03:07:42.586]  They said, well, the threshold's 30%.
[03:07:44.383 --> 03:07:51.227]  And then the big Democratic Party lobbying groups all hit all of the pages with anti-Semitic comments.
[03:07:51.227 --> 03:07:54.068]  And the pages were all taken down.
[03:07:54.068 --> 03:07:58.110]  And I was certified a hate figure because of the comments.
[03:07:58.110 --> 03:07:59.571]  So that's a pretty simple thing.
[03:07:59.571 --> 03:08:04.073]  Email somebody child porn, they don't open it, they're a child porn purveyor.
[03:08:04.073 --> 03:08:10.636]  Make some anti-Jewish comments on somebody's Facebook commenter, we gonna ban your butt forever.
[03:08:10.636 --> 03:08:11.457]  That's the left, folks.
[03:08:13.729 --> 03:08:16.271]  But this is them in their death throes.
[03:08:16.271 --> 03:08:18.592]  Everybody's emptying out of the blue cities.
[03:08:18.592 --> 03:08:20.913]  Everybody's emptying out of their states.
[03:08:20.913 --> 03:08:22.454]  Everyone's turning against them.
[03:08:22.454 --> 03:08:24.015]  Look at this shot here.
[03:08:24.015 --> 03:08:29.939]  I've got a call here from the Daily Beast.
[03:08:29.939 --> 03:08:31.560]  Telling a story on Judge Bellis.
[03:08:32.921 --> 03:08:37.643]  Saying the FBI contacted her about debt threats made against her on the M4 site.
[03:08:37.643 --> 03:08:39.763]  I'm guessing this refers to anonymous commenters.
[03:08:39.763 --> 03:08:45.185]  Not any actual M4 employees, but wanted to reach out in case you wanted to comment.
[03:08:45.185 --> 03:08:47.566]  And you know what the headline's gonna be.
[03:08:47.566 --> 03:08:51.008]  Jones and his followers after her.
[03:08:51.008 --> 03:08:54.369]  Just like they lie and say I sent people to Sandy Hook to investigate 9-11.
[03:08:54.369 --> 03:08:57.530]  It's these lawyers, these Democrats, that live
[03:09:00.012 --> 03:09:09.543]  Off of Sandy Hook, I talked about it in Google Analytics, zero, it's .023 or something.
[03:09:09.543 --> 03:09:12.105]  And that's with all the coverage!
[03:09:12.105 --> 03:09:15.349]  Can't stand it!
[03:09:15.349 --> 03:09:18.673]  It don't matter to them though, because it's their baby.
[03:09:20.054 --> 03:09:24.320]  They squeeze so much money out of these dead kids, suing the hero dead teachers.
[03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:25.602]  It never ends.
[03:09:25.602 --> 03:09:28.145]  You know, he's taking over, but I promise to take your calls.
[03:09:28.145 --> 03:09:35.115]  Dr. Nick Begich is ready to take over in the war room, but remember, every minute this show's on air, they can't stand it.
[03:09:35.796 --> 03:09:44.221]  And every minute you spread the word and say, hey, that forbidden show, the one you can't name, the one they don't want you to hear, hear what he's really saying, learn why they're so scared.
[03:09:44.221 --> 03:09:51.205]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, because if they can't shut us down, they've thrown everything they've got at us.
[03:09:51.205 --> 03:09:53.506]  Well, they're pretty worthless to the globalists, aren't they?
[03:09:53.506 --> 03:09:57.788]  That's why they're all going bankrupt.
[03:09:57.788 --> 03:10:02.251]  Carlos in Canada, then Chase and Johnny.
[03:10:02.251 --> 03:10:03.952]  Carlos, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[03:10:04.841 --> 03:10:06.282]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:10:06.282 --> 03:10:19.393]  For a minute, yesterday, I thought when I heard that the attacks were going to be launched against Iran, I said, oh my God, there goes President Trump's Nobel Peace Prize.
[03:10:19.393 --> 03:10:22.215]  I believe today he has earned it.
[03:10:22.215 --> 03:10:24.637]  This decision was great.
[03:10:24.637 --> 03:10:25.959]  A great decision.
[03:10:25.959 --> 03:10:30.002]  Now he has to follow it with some other equally important decisions.
[03:10:31.155 --> 03:10:41.678]  One of them, I believe, because of circumstances and the time span and the threats that have been issued by Iran about, you know, enrichment of uranium and so on.
[03:10:41.678 --> 03:10:50.660]  So far, they have complied with an agreement that was signed, but not ratified by the United States Senate or Congress, with Iran.
[03:10:50.660 --> 03:10:56.261]  But the European Union wants to work with Iran to maintain that agreement.
[03:10:56.261 --> 03:10:58.402]  And that agreement, as long as it's complied for 10 years,
[03:10:59.412 --> 03:11:07.195]  It gives the world an opportunity to look into better relationships in the Middle East all around.
[03:11:07.195 --> 03:11:26.842]  So, I believe if President Trump was really wise, in this instance, would, with all respect, okay, to the information he has that I don't have, I would suggest that he allow trust in the allies in Europe to keep the agreement with Iran going on
[03:11:27.367 --> 03:11:47.715]  While the United States thinks about proposals to renew and improve the existing agreement, not forcefully, but diplomatically by showing the reasons why 10 years is not enough or whatever could be renegotiated, I believe with all my heart that if those decisions are made,
[03:11:48.323 --> 03:11:52.584]  I believe that such things can be achieved in the Middle East.
[03:11:52.584 --> 03:12:10.709]  Too many people, like Senator Schumer, were celebrating the fact that they thought that they were going to get themselves blockage of the Straits of Hormuz, and like other journalists have written, the pipelines were going to flow through Saudi Arabia, you know,
[03:12:11.528 --> 03:12:14.530]  You know, through Israel and so on to Europe.
[03:12:14.530 --> 03:12:25.615]  Well, those dreams have to be put aside because a world war is certainly in the making if that is insisted upon.
[03:12:25.615 --> 03:12:26.836]  Those are really great points.
[03:12:26.836 --> 03:12:27.796]  God bless you, Carlos.
[03:12:27.796 --> 03:12:28.757]  I appreciate your call.
[03:12:28.757 --> 03:12:32.939]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lou in Arizona.
[03:12:32.939 --> 03:12:33.599]  You're on the air, Lou.
[03:12:33.599 --> 03:12:34.099]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:34.099 --> 03:12:37.581]  What do you think about the situation?
[03:12:37.581 --> 03:12:38.141]  Yeah, Alex.
[03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:48.545]  I wanted to point out that not anybody is really talking about Iran as one of the last industrial countries that's not part of the global banking system.
[03:12:48.545 --> 03:12:49.165]  No, you're right.
[03:12:49.165 --> 03:12:55.729]  They're one of the last countries the globalists don't control that can actually produce industrial goods.
[03:12:55.729 --> 03:12:59.671]  Yeah, I mean the other one is like North Korea.
[03:12:59.671 --> 03:13:03.393]  And North Korea is like right on the doorstep of China and has that protection from China.
[03:13:04.946 --> 03:13:10.111]  They can never put together, you know, to advance the globalist plans, they can never put together a U.N.
[03:13:10.111 --> 03:13:15.496]  invasion force like they did in the first Gulf War, but like to have a real threat to fight them.
[03:13:15.496 --> 03:13:27.747]  I think that's what they're setting up with Iran, that they, and why Trump is here doing this stable rattling and getting them, because I don't know if you heard this from like the Ayatollah about a month back, but he just said, he came out and said, there's not going to be any fighting from us.
[03:13:28.306 --> 03:13:38.812]  Well, that's the obvious plan of any smart person, because it's like, they're just going to get won over and killed completely if they, you know, he knows there's no win to be had to fight the whole world coming at him.
[03:13:38.812 --> 03:13:56.902]  But, he's not the only person with power there, and it's like, you do the stable rallying for a long period of time, and get him like, you have to get him worked up slowly so that they know that a fight is coming, but they don't have anything else to do but fight, and so they need to put up a good fight against the whole United Nations Army, and that's what Trump is there for.
[03:13:57.759 --> 03:14:02.381]  Don't make any mistake, we've never in a million years let Trump lead such a force.
[03:14:02.381 --> 03:14:08.863]  It's going to be the next president, and certainly a Democrat, to lead that kind of global force.
[03:14:08.863 --> 03:14:16.105]  It's going to be a platform to get into greater layers of control of the global government.
[03:14:16.513 --> 03:14:26.701]  Well that's definitely it and you look at how Bush was bad, Bush Senior, but then the Clintons like tripled the sanctions, half a million kids died, and Madeleine Albright said it was true, it was a good price to pay.
[03:14:26.701 --> 03:14:32.406]  These are bloodthirsty monsters when they shake their fingers at those of us in the press and call us fake news.
[03:14:32.406 --> 03:14:35.108]  These are conscious liars.
[03:14:35.108 --> 03:14:36.910]  Thank you so much Lou.
[03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:39.892]  I'm going to get a few more calls in and then Dr. Nick Meyers is taking over.
[03:14:39.892 --> 03:14:41.273]  We've had a very tumultuous day.
[03:14:41.273 --> 03:14:43.315]  A lot of other news is going to be breaking.
[03:14:44.645 --> 03:14:53.109]  On InfoWars.com, but they're definitely a year and a half out from this election, or less, making their move on InfoWars.
[03:14:53.109 --> 03:15:00.052]  So, more than ever, download the shows, save them, and whatever they say about us in the future, they're able to shut us down.
[03:15:00.052 --> 03:15:05.055]  Please defend us, folks, because they want to capture us as a symbol and then
[03:15:06.704 --> 03:15:12.231]  Create a mutated straw man out of it that they can then run around and do terrible things in my name.
[03:15:12.231 --> 03:15:18.559]  They want to set us up, shut us down, put me in prison.
[03:15:18.559 --> 03:15:25.127]  That's their whole Homeland Show thesis, which they admit is their plan, so they can then say horrible things in my name.
[03:15:25.871 --> 03:15:29.572]  And they're just already doing things that are just astronomically crazy.
[03:15:29.572 --> 03:15:35.434]  They're escalating against everybody really fast, which shows I believe they're getting ready to make their move on Trump.
[03:15:35.434 --> 03:15:38.075]  And I think this war with Iran was a big part of it.
[03:15:38.075 --> 03:15:42.396]  They wanted me off the air ahead of this war because they thought I would be against it.
[03:15:42.396 --> 03:15:45.257]  Well, a lot of folks are against it and nobody's buying it.
[03:15:45.257 --> 03:15:46.878]  So we're in a whole new ballgame.
[03:15:46.878 --> 03:15:48.739]  Dr. Nick Begich is coming up.
[03:15:48.739 --> 03:15:49.539]  A few more calls.

[03:17:23.860 --> 03:17:27.781]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.781 --> 03:17:29.321]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.321 --> 03:17:32.282]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.282 --> 03:17:37.843]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:19:34.682 --> 03:19:37.203]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:19.611 --> 03:20:22.472]  Alright, the great Dr. Nick Begich coming up in the next segment.
[03:20:22.472 --> 03:20:31.457]  I appreciate him letting me annex a few segments here when he normally hosts the 4th Hour on Fridays because we've got incredible stuff going on right now and I promise to take a few of your calls.
[03:20:31.457 --> 03:20:35.119]  But you know, his dad's the guy that freed up all the land for the people in Alaska.
[03:20:35.908 --> 03:20:37.170]  They took his airplane down for that.
[03:20:37.170 --> 03:20:42.378]  So, you know, doing the right thing gets expensive on people that do it, but that's how we got here.
[03:20:42.378 --> 03:20:45.062]  So I'm not a victim, I'm a target.
[03:20:45.062 --> 03:20:46.885]  And it's getting crazy, though.
[03:20:46.885 --> 03:20:50.090]  They're saying that Owen wants to kill Obama, all over the news, without showing the clip.
[03:20:50.896 --> 03:20:52.357]  They're saying I'm doing all these horrible things.
[03:20:52.357 --> 03:20:56.300]  You know, we have the FBI letters saying I was the victim of somebody sending his child porn.
[03:20:56.300 --> 03:21:00.263]  And then they knew right what to, you know, basically subpoena everything just magically.
[03:21:00.263 --> 03:21:02.444]  I'm sure it's all just a coincidence.
[03:21:02.444 --> 03:21:05.046]  Probably is.
[03:21:05.046 --> 03:21:05.746]  It's getting correct.
[03:21:05.746 --> 03:21:09.369]  They say I said Jew boy on air and I didn't.
[03:21:09.369 --> 03:21:11.130]  And then you see the video and I don't say that.
[03:21:11.130 --> 03:21:13.011]  I say white shoe boys.
[03:21:13.011 --> 03:21:14.613]  White shoe boys.
[03:21:15.862 --> 03:21:24.766]  I think Iran's an important topic, but what I think is more important is that we end the bleeding that's going on at InfoWars.
[03:21:45.222 --> 03:21:54.271]  I think you guys need to do like a raffle lottery that you guys can sell a ticket because you're our Elvis, you know?
[03:21:54.271 --> 03:21:56.192]  I'll tell you what scares me.
[03:21:56.192 --> 03:21:59.936]  When I really push hard for funds, we get enough in to keep going.
[03:21:59.936 --> 03:22:01.297]  And I'd like to have reserves.
[03:22:01.297 --> 03:22:03.880]  So we're not just up here, oh we need help right now.
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:06.702]  It's crazy how enough comes in to keep operating.
[03:22:06.702 --> 03:22:08.604]  I'd feel a lot better to be able to focus more on news.
[03:22:10.566 --> 03:22:27.461]  We had a lot of extra capital, so just folks, please get your staple coffee and toothpaste at InfoWarshore.com, and please support our local AM and FM station, because that's really the backbone they've tried to target unsuccessfully, because conservative talk show owners and managers understand the leftist BS.
[03:22:27.461 --> 03:22:28.281]  So thanks for the support.
[03:22:28.281 --> 03:22:30.723]  What's your view on Iran, my friend?
[03:22:30.723 --> 03:22:35.267]  Well, you know, like I was saying, though, but every two weeks I get paid.
[03:22:35.267 --> 03:22:37.269]  I buy product every two weeks.
[03:22:38.061 --> 03:22:46.564]  If you guys did a, you know, like a raffle lottery where the winner would get, you know, a big prize and get flown down and get to be on your show, I think that would pump the info.
[03:22:46.564 --> 03:22:46.984]  Done!
[03:22:46.984 --> 03:22:50.526]  We should have a monthly raffle.
[03:22:50.526 --> 03:22:52.146]  Everybody buys raffles.
[03:22:52.146 --> 03:22:53.367]  You got like three winners.
[03:22:53.367 --> 03:22:54.287]  One person gets a...
[03:22:55.720 --> 03:22:58.701]  Original Alex Jones painting I do for you while you're here right in front of you.
[03:22:58.701 --> 03:23:03.662]  I'm not the best painter, but... And then you get to be on the show for 30 minutes and, you know, whatever, for the winner.
[03:23:03.662 --> 03:23:10.104]  And the second place person, you know, gets a firearm or something, you know, delivered to the FFL dealer of their choice.
[03:23:10.104 --> 03:23:16.406]  And the third place person gets a steak knife.
[03:23:16.406 --> 03:23:19.027]  Yeah, Trump just needs... We just need to get out of Iran.
[03:23:19.027 --> 03:23:21.028]  We need to quit being the world's police.
[03:23:21.028 --> 03:23:21.768]  It's bullcrap.
[03:23:24.321 --> 03:23:24.921]  I agree, brother.
[03:23:24.921 --> 03:23:27.162]  Thanks for the call.
[03:23:27.162 --> 03:23:29.882]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chase the Patriot in California.
[03:23:29.882 --> 03:23:32.483]  You're on the air, Chase.
[03:23:32.483 --> 03:23:33.963]  Alex, what a year!
[03:23:33.963 --> 03:23:36.104]  Hey, I want to get into first thanking you.
[03:23:36.104 --> 03:23:41.225]  I just celebrated my one-year anniversary, and you did the Reporter Challenge last year.
[03:23:41.225 --> 03:23:41.585]  Yes, sir.
[03:23:41.585 --> 03:23:47.967]  And when you were going through that, that's when they started hitting you, just completely hardcore, banning you everywhere.
[03:23:47.967 --> 03:23:52.568]  But I'm just continuing going, and I just celebrated my one-year anniversary, so thank you for that.
[03:23:53.021 --> 03:23:54.342]  I go live every night.
[03:23:54.342 --> 03:23:58.325]  But anyway, we're having a real power struggle right now in our government.
[03:23:58.325 --> 03:24:05.470]  And I want to talk about my representative, Congressman Nunes, who sadly, he's been doing great against the deep state.
[03:24:05.470 --> 03:24:10.194]  But now, you know, when you see his connections to Saudi Arabia, it scares me.
[03:24:10.194 --> 03:24:15.237]  But on the other side, you have Rand Paul, who yesterday on the floor of the Senate was raising alarm.
[03:24:15.237 --> 03:24:16.939]  A very powerful speech.
[03:24:16.939 --> 03:24:18.740]  You know, there's an article... I saw that.
[03:24:18.740 --> 03:24:19.501]  I should have aired that.
[03:24:19.501 --> 03:24:20.161]  I meant to air that.
[03:24:20.161 --> 03:24:21.222]  I forgot to send that to the crew.
[03:24:22.239 --> 03:24:30.883]  Yes, because if you remember back, February of this year, it was reported about, you know, the administration trying to push for a Saudi nuclear deal.
[03:24:30.883 --> 03:24:36.065]  And that is something that should not be happening, and they are trying to arm Saudi Arabia.
[03:24:36.065 --> 03:24:39.406]  So again, it's this proxy war situation.
[03:24:39.406 --> 03:24:46.029]  And, you know, I'm concerned because my own congressman, so I dug down deep into it, and there's this name that came up, Derek Harvey.
[03:24:46.491 --> 03:24:50.792]  It was actually fired from the National Security Council because he was the go-between.
[03:24:50.792 --> 03:24:56.594]  He was trying to set up the Saudi deal, and now he happens to be working in the office of Congressman Nunes.
[03:24:56.594 --> 03:24:58.814]  So my, you know, my alert is up.
[03:24:58.814 --> 03:24:59.855]  I'm very concerned.
[03:24:59.855 --> 03:25:04.516]  I've tried to actually ask Congressman Nunes about it, and he kind of just brushed me off.
[03:25:04.516 --> 03:25:06.496]  So it's alarming, Alex.
[03:25:06.496 --> 03:25:08.537]  Have you remember hearing about that at all?
[03:25:09.986 --> 03:25:10.767]  Yes, I do.
[03:25:10.767 --> 03:25:13.509]  And you've also got Sean Hannity foaming at the mouth wanting war.
[03:25:13.509 --> 03:25:16.751]  And I like Sean, but you know, this is not good.
[03:25:16.751 --> 03:25:17.652]  Wars are not good.
[03:25:17.652 --> 03:25:19.073]  We don't need this.
[03:25:19.073 --> 03:25:20.394]  They can really get out of control.
[03:25:20.394 --> 03:25:22.396]  Thank you so much, Chase.
[03:25:22.396 --> 03:25:24.177]  It's just crazy.
[03:25:24.177 --> 03:25:29.201]  And remember, they want us off the air while they launch all this.
[03:25:29.201 --> 03:25:30.542]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[03:25:30.542 --> 03:25:32.564]  Let's take a few more calls here as fast as we can.
[03:25:38.251 --> 03:25:39.592]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:25:39.592 --> 03:25:40.372]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:25:40.372 --> 03:25:42.053]  Thanks for holding.
[03:25:42.053 --> 03:25:42.813]  Hey, Alex.
[03:25:42.813 --> 03:25:47.335]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:25:47.335 --> 03:25:54.377]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:25:54.377 --> 03:26:04.902]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:26:07.145 --> 03:26:08.366]  That's it.
[03:26:08.366 --> 03:26:11.928]  I think a war over there, they're going to sabotage him.
[03:26:11.928 --> 03:26:16.451]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:26:16.451 --> 03:26:19.813]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:26:19.813 --> 03:26:25.177]  And he's done the right thing so far, but these provocations, these ships, and now this drone.
[03:26:25.177 --> 03:26:27.018]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:26:28.112 --> 03:26:28.873]  I agree entirely.
[03:26:28.873 --> 03:26:36.317]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:26:36.317 --> 03:26:39.399]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:26:39.399 --> 03:26:41.660]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:26:41.660 --> 03:26:47.144]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles,
[03:26:48.104 --> 03:26:51.805]  There are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:26:51.805 --> 03:26:53.726]  We're going to keep fighting in the Infowar.
[03:26:53.726 --> 03:27:01.769]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:27:01.769 --> 03:27:03.270]  Brother, that's the best thing I've heard.
[03:27:03.270 --> 03:27:05.010]  But I want you to understand something.
[03:27:05.010 --> 03:27:06.411]  They don't want to just get me off air.
[03:27:07.532 --> 03:27:11.655]  Once they've silenced me, they plan to set me up, imprison me, or kill me.
[03:27:11.655 --> 03:27:18.280]  They want to fully capture InfoWars so they can then take control of it and use it as a vehicle against the Liberty Movement.
[03:27:18.280 --> 03:27:19.441]  That's the enemy's paradigm.
[03:27:19.441 --> 03:27:22.403]  That's why we've got to stay on air as long as possible.
[03:27:22.403 --> 03:27:25.706]  And if they do shut us down, you've got to fight for our name because they want to
[03:27:26.286 --> 03:27:32.188]  Take over InfoWars, lie about us, and then use the fraud, the straw man, against everybody.
[03:27:32.188 --> 03:27:36.069]  And I will not be turned into a weapon against the human community.
[03:27:36.069 --> 03:27:38.910]  I want a pro-human future, but that is the score.
[03:27:38.910 --> 03:27:41.650]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:27:41.650 --> 03:27:47.092]  Okay, Steve, Johnny, and Johnny, if you call me back on Sunday, I'll take your calls.
[03:27:47.092 --> 03:27:48.012]  Just go to the other line.
[03:27:48.012 --> 03:27:48.492]  I'm out of time.
[03:27:48.492 --> 03:27:50.873]  I've already stolen two segments from Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:27:51.826 --> 03:27:56.708]  He's got a lot to cover, and just be ready for that for the next 30 minutes on the other side.

[03:29:54.381 --> 03:29:56.964]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[03:29:56.964 --> 03:29:58.786]  We're going into the season of war.
[03:29:58.786 --> 03:30:04.852]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[03:30:04.852 --> 03:30:08.535]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[03:30:08.535 --> 03:30:09.436]  We need to end here.
[03:30:09.436 --> 03:30:10.758]  We need to be provisioned.
[03:30:10.758 --> 03:30:15.142]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[03:30:15.342 --> 03:30:19.225]  I'm 11 every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[03:30:19.225 --> 03:30:21.146]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[03:30:21.146 --> 03:30:26.109]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[03:30:26.109 --> 03:30:29.431]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[03:30:29.431 --> 03:30:30.272]  I need gas.
[03:30:30.272 --> 03:30:31.793]  I need ammo politically now!
[03:30:32.173 --> 03:30:39.599]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[03:30:39.599 --> 03:30:41.020]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[03:30:41.020 --> 03:30:48.046]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[03:30:48.046 --> 03:30:49.027]  You have my commitment.
[03:30:49.027 --> 03:30:53.391]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[03:30:55.120 --> 03:31:02.484]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:31:02.484 --> 03:31:05.566]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[03:31:05.566 --> 03:31:07.167]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[03:31:07.167 --> 03:31:09.868]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:31:09.868 --> 03:31:11.349]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:31:11.349 --> 03:31:17.833]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[03:31:17.833 --> 03:31:20.334]  So remember, you are the InfoWarrant.
[03:31:20.334 --> 03:31:22.135]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[03:31:22.135 --> 03:31:23.716]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:31:24.116 --> 03:31:29.517]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[03:31:29.517 --> 03:31:37.238]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[03:31:37.238 --> 03:31:40.079]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[03:31:40.079 --> 03:31:44.980]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[03:31:44.980 --> 03:31:48.140]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[03:31:48.140 --> 03:31:50.261]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[03:31:50.261 --> 03:31:50.701]  God bless you.
[03:31:54.742 --> 03:32:10.672]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:32:10.672 --> 03:32:12.373]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:32:12.373 --> 03:32:23.259]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[03:32:23.459 --> 03:32:24.440]  We're good to go.
[03:32:43.408 --> 03:32:45.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:14.369 --> 03:33:16.490]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.490 --> 03:33:18.410]  Because there is a war on.
[03:33:18.410 --> 03:33:20.031]  For your mind.
[03:33:20.031 --> 03:33:24.252]  With Nick Begich.
[03:33:24.252 --> 03:33:26.713]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:33:26.713 --> 03:33:28.313]  InfoWars.com.
[03:33:28.313 --> 03:33:35.195]  And I appreciate being here this last half hour and the fourth hour of this Friday.
[03:33:35.195 --> 03:33:39.797]  You know, thinking about where I'm coming from today, I'm in Alaska.
[03:33:39.797 --> 03:33:40.657]  You know, this is the
[03:33:41.677 --> 03:33:45.299]  Lightest spot right now.
[03:33:45.299 --> 03:33:47.461]  We have the white night, right?
[03:33:47.461 --> 03:33:53.324]  The sun doesn't go down and for most of the day and it's kind of like the rest.
[03:33:53.324 --> 03:33:56.466]  But we have 19 hours of daylight plus here in Anchorage today.
[03:33:57.266 --> 03:34:08.249]  And the longest day of the year and the images for those who get to see them is me flying into a really remote area of Alaska where I have some property.
[03:34:08.249 --> 03:34:23.733]  You know, I'm thinking about the context of today's program, you know, the last couple hours, particularly thinking about, you know, where we are in the world, you know, at the brink of World War Three or the edge of Armageddon or
[03:34:24.770 --> 03:34:33.155]  The last days, the doom and gloom, you know, the brink of the big one, you know, and that's where we're sitting.
[03:34:33.155 --> 03:34:49.365]  And, you know, I think about sort of what I've been doing the last 25 years is a lot of work in the mind control manipulation propaganda, if you will, on a 21st century platform of technology.
[03:34:49.365 --> 03:34:49.765]  And so
[03:34:50.689 --> 03:35:17.452]  When we start to think about the shaping of the public opinion, the moving of the herd as the elites look at us so often, you really start to get the picture because big media, big tech, the Internet, all of it has allowed for the biggest level of profiling on an individual basis has ever been contemplated by any government program.
[03:35:17.452 --> 03:35:18.313]  I mean, beyond
[03:35:19.636 --> 03:35:25.038]  Total awareness beyond, you know, every aspect of invasiveness.
[03:35:25.038 --> 03:35:37.301]  You know, we know from recent disclosures the whole background, as it's being reported at least in some outlets, of Zuckerberg and, you know, what he was up to and how that all came about.
[03:35:37.301 --> 03:35:39.922]  But it all makes perfect sense, quite frankly.
[03:35:39.922 --> 03:35:42.882]  Whether it was the chicken or the egg, it doesn't really matter.
[03:35:42.882 --> 03:35:44.703]  The fact is these systems are used.
[03:35:45.403 --> 03:35:46.084]  We're good to go.
[03:36:12.134 --> 03:36:22.818]  Really, the sub-theme of the multimedia event we see playing out in the Gulf between Iran and fiction.
[03:36:22.818 --> 03:36:24.059]  Or maybe not.
[03:36:24.059 --> 03:36:27.680]  But here's the point that I would raise.
[03:36:27.680 --> 03:36:31.141]  What is our interest in the Middle East, if any at all?
[03:36:31.141 --> 03:36:35.883]  I mean, if they choke off all the oil and gas coming out of there, do we care?
[03:36:35.883 --> 03:36:36.823]  How does it affect us?
[03:36:36.823 --> 03:36:40.705]  Will it make a big mess of the economy and shove oil prices up?
[03:36:41.836 --> 03:36:43.297]  Uh, maybe.
[03:36:43.297 --> 03:36:45.259]  You know, I don't know, maybe.
[03:36:45.259 --> 03:36:54.826]  Oil prices will go up, that's for sure, and we're exporting oil now, so I guess American companies make more money, at least on the development side, small producers.
[03:36:54.826 --> 03:36:58.328]  And, you know, here's the deal on all of it.
[03:36:58.328 --> 03:37:08.175]  It's a global manipulation of as many players as have power, and those are the people with high technologies, which happens to be the United States.
[03:37:08.175 --> 03:37:10.577]  Now, why are we being drawn into some mess
[03:37:11.616 --> 03:37:19.062]  Again, because some people's vision of the world is Armageddon, quite frankly.
[03:37:19.062 --> 03:37:21.544]  That idea of a World War III.
[03:37:21.544 --> 03:37:24.366]  You know, who benefits from this?
[03:37:24.366 --> 03:37:31.191]  And they're the same players that my dad used to complain about when he was in the Congress in the early 70s.
[03:37:31.191 --> 03:37:34.374]  It's the arms industry.
[03:37:34.374 --> 03:37:36.576]  The high-tech arms industry.
[03:37:36.576 --> 03:37:39.518]  And when you look at the real money spent in federal budgets,
[03:37:40.242 --> 03:37:41.883]  You know, the buck stops there.
[03:37:41.883 --> 03:37:54.067]  And most of that is spent to pretend or to be or to pretend to be the global hammer for the Police Department of the United Nations, who none of us voted for, right?
[03:37:54.067 --> 03:37:56.148]  I mean, we don't vote for anybody in the United Nations.
[03:37:56.148 --> 03:38:03.551]  I don't care, you know, what they do as a dialogue, but they're not going to tell me what to do as a sovereign soul.
[03:38:03.551 --> 03:38:07.252]  And, you know, the country itself has been hijacked to go promote
[03:38:07.921 --> 03:38:11.904]  Globalist agendas through these kinds of institutions.
[03:38:11.904 --> 03:38:14.506]  And I resent it as an American.
[03:38:14.506 --> 03:38:17.368]  I resent it as just a human being.
[03:38:17.368 --> 03:38:19.289]  Forget my citizenship.
[03:38:19.289 --> 03:38:30.177]  I think it tramples over the sovereignty of other sovereign citizens around the world that don't live in the United States, that we ought to respect also, regardless of whether we like their forms of government.
[03:38:30.177 --> 03:38:33.159]  I mean, the Saudis, you know, that's a kingdom for God's sake.
[03:38:34.349 --> 03:38:38.130]  You know, that hides their women and beats them in public.
[03:38:38.130 --> 03:38:43.152]  You know, but they're our ally because we don't make value just what they do within the culture, moral culture.
[03:38:43.152 --> 03:38:44.952]  I guess we exempt that.
[03:38:44.952 --> 03:38:46.913]  But then we condemn others for whatever they do.
[03:38:46.913 --> 03:38:48.133]  You know, I don't get it.
[03:38:48.133 --> 03:38:53.214]  You know, sometimes it's a bit confusing from my perspective as an American.
[03:38:53.214 --> 03:38:58.376]  But look around the world at the governments that we prop up and the nature of the nonsense.
[03:38:58.376 --> 03:39:02.277]  Then you look at where we have our conflicts in the world today.
[03:39:03.067 --> 03:39:04.889]  And why are we there?
[03:39:04.889 --> 03:39:07.072]  Why did we go there in the first place?
[03:39:07.072 --> 03:39:09.234]  What is our vital interest?
[03:39:09.234 --> 03:39:20.087]  The whole reason we're in the Middle East today, actively in Syria and Iraq, is because we destabilized Iraq under the guise of weapons of mass destruction that weren't there.
[03:39:21.169 --> 03:39:24.710]  You know, the terrorists, they weren't there.
[03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:35.514]  So now we have terrorists everywhere, you know, because we've made a lot of people angry and wiped out a tenth of their population in the course of these wars, you know, along with them wiping out a bunch of people.
[03:39:35.514 --> 03:39:39.556]  So here, you know, the killing has to stop, I think is right.
[03:39:39.556 --> 03:39:43.437]  I'm glad no one has died in whatever's going on.
[03:39:44.447 --> 03:39:52.310]  In Iran, and I would be highly skeptical of whatever's thrown our way because Iranians know also it's, you know, it's demolition time.
[03:39:52.310 --> 03:39:59.773]  But here's, if people go back to World War II and remember what happened there, you know, before the war, there was all these alliances nobody knew about.
[03:39:59.773 --> 03:40:01.314]  They weren't public.
[03:40:01.314 --> 03:40:05.635]  Iran's alliances are with China and Russia and others, I'm sure.
[03:40:05.635 --> 03:40:06.396]  And so do tech.
[03:40:06.396 --> 03:40:09.977]  When you tech, all the same as NATO states, you know, and how that all works.
[03:40:11.184 --> 03:40:18.889]  So we need to be mindful of what we decide we want to engage and decide, indeed, is it our interest we're defending or someone else's?
[03:40:18.889 --> 03:40:24.992]  And perhaps that someone else might defend their own interests instead of us or change.
[03:40:24.992 --> 03:40:29.295]  And that might be an interesting thought, you know, for all of us to contemplate as Americans.
[03:40:29.295 --> 03:40:35.559]  But getting back to the story of the day, which is, you know, Armageddon reality creation, you know, we can see it happening.
[03:40:35.559 --> 03:40:37.440]  And let me tell you something about the physics of it.
[03:40:37.938 --> 03:40:50.343]  You know, human beings actually participate in the creation in a more fundamental way that quantum physics shows us, where we actually impact our reality, you know, so we think,
[03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:57.352]  And then we speak the words and then reality begins to happen if the words have any power at all in them.
[03:40:57.352 --> 03:41:00.694]  And that power that gets injected in them is generally human emotion.
[03:41:00.694 --> 03:41:11.219]  It can be what people call good emotions or bad emotions, but it's emotional content that sort of shoves the information in a way that takes form.
[03:41:11.219 --> 03:41:20.463]  So when you have millions of listeners, like what Alex has, that empowers individuals to look at an issue
[03:41:21.104 --> 03:41:28.416]  Together, millions at a time, together look at an issue, contemplate it and send our energy into that for change.
[03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:34.532]  Push it along with whatever we can do.
[03:41:34.532 --> 03:41:37.313]  Whatever we can do as individuals, do that.
[03:41:37.313 --> 03:41:46.276]  That might be talking to your neighbors about this network and this program, or it might be calling your congressman, which always is, you know, you think, does that really matter?
[03:41:46.276 --> 03:41:46.956]  It really does.
[03:41:46.956 --> 03:41:47.737]  Handwrite a letter.
[03:41:47.737 --> 03:41:56.120]  It really does matter because these are the old tools that still get the message through in a way that people know is amplified.
[03:41:56.120 --> 03:41:56.380]  So,
[03:41:57.395 --> 03:42:17.448]  Do what you can in your own reality creation and push back against the globalist elite because the countermeasure to what's being created, and I want to talk about that in the terms of a matrix of information versus what already exists in the universe with us as human beings.
[03:42:18.129 --> 03:42:25.996]  Created in the likeness and image of God, whatever that means, and I want to explore that a little bit after the break, and we'll talk about it.
[03:42:25.996 --> 03:42:27.457]  And what, you know, what is coming?
[03:42:27.457 --> 03:42:36.365]  How do we reshape this reality to be one that changes the world in a new direction and not the one this train wreck is headed into?
[03:42:36.365 --> 03:42:41.189]  This is Dr. Nick Begich standing in for Alex Jones on the InfoWars.
[03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:42.390]  InfoWars.com.
[03:42:42.390 --> 03:42:43.091]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:53.650 --> 03:42:57.816]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.816 --> 03:43:08.070]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.370 --> 03:43:08.971]  We're good to go.
[03:43:27.651 --> 03:43:45.417]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.417 --> 03:43:52.120]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:53.171 --> 03:44:00.882]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[03:44:00.882 --> 03:44:01.362]  It's you!
[03:44:02.452 --> 03:44:04.954]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:44:04.954 --> 03:44:06.275]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:44:06.275 --> 03:44:09.237]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:44:23.852 --> 03:44:25.273]  We are the renaissance.
[03:44:25.273 --> 03:44:26.033]  And we are winning.
[03:44:54.540 --> 03:44:56.401]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[03:44:56.401 --> 03:44:57.662]  This is the maximum alert.
[03:44:57.662 --> 03:44:58.823]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[03:44:58.823 --> 03:45:00.244]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[03:45:00.244 --> 03:45:06.528]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support, and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:06.528 --> 03:45:08.329]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[03:45:08.329 --> 03:45:08.929]  There's a P.O.
[03:45:08.929 --> 03:45:10.190]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[03:45:10.190 --> 03:45:11.991]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[03:45:11.991 --> 03:45:13.452]  We need money to fight back.
[03:45:13.612 --> 03:45:16.274]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.
[03:45:16.274 --> 03:45:19.175]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.

[03:45:38.388 --> 03:45:39.209]  We're not going to back down.
[03:45:55.111 --> 03:46:07.145]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[03:46:07.145 --> 03:46:10.028]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[03:46:10.368 --> 03:46:11.048]  I don't know.
[03:46:29.838 --> 03:46:30.778]  I like to be expanding.
[03:46:30.778 --> 03:46:31.558]  I like to be winning.
[03:46:31.558 --> 03:46:32.279]  I like to be fighting.
[03:46:32.279 --> 03:46:33.459]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[03:46:33.459 --> 03:46:34.339]  That's why we're so hated.
[03:46:34.339 --> 03:46:35.959]  But we need to be retreaded.
[03:46:35.959 --> 03:46:37.159]  We need to be tuned up.
[03:46:37.159 --> 03:46:38.220]  We need to be fixed up.
[03:46:38.220 --> 03:46:39.560]  We never have time to get in a dry dock.
[03:46:39.560 --> 03:46:41.080]  We got a lot of holes shot in us.
[03:46:41.080 --> 03:46:43.401]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[03:46:43.401 --> 03:46:45.941]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[03:46:45.941 --> 03:46:47.922]  Then they're going to kill me or you or anybody else.
[03:46:47.922 --> 03:46:50.762]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[03:46:50.762 --> 03:46:52.543]  Funded by foreign banks and the Chai Com show.
[03:46:52.543 --> 03:46:56.643]  Go to InfowarStore.com.
[03:46:56.643 --> 03:46:59.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.810 --> 03:47:16.584]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.584 --> 03:47:20.211]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:47:22.487 --> 03:47:23.969]  And welcome back.
[03:47:23.969 --> 03:47:26.090]  And you know, I love it.
[03:47:26.090 --> 03:47:37.100]  During the break, Connor, who's helping today in the production of the show, and I are talking about quantum physics, kind of where I left off, and sort of this what are we really a question.
[03:47:37.100 --> 03:47:39.762]  And I get on this theme a lot.
[03:47:39.762 --> 03:47:46.208]  And it's important to me to stay on this theme a lot, because I think it's fundamental to everything we're doing here.
[03:47:48.027 --> 03:47:50.952]  I do believe, along with the big three, right?
[03:47:50.952 --> 03:47:59.205]  Christians, Jewish, Muslims, I believe even Hindus and Buddhists and a bunch of other people believe this too.
[03:48:00.235 --> 03:48:05.017]  That we're created in the image and likeness of the Creator, God.
[03:48:05.017 --> 03:48:10.638]  And, you know, you think about that, sort of how this creation thing goes according to Genesis.
[03:48:10.638 --> 03:48:18.041]  You know, people who want to look that up, and a lot of the listeners here I know are Christians, so I'm going to use that as a reference point, if that's okay.
[03:48:18.041 --> 03:48:20.001]  And if it's not okay, I apologize.
[03:48:20.001 --> 03:48:23.182]  I don't mean to pick one over another, offend anybody.
[03:48:23.182 --> 03:48:24.543]  That's not my objective here.
[03:48:24.543 --> 03:48:28.264]  It's to illustrate a point that science says the same thing.
[03:48:29.036 --> 03:48:30.117]  And why is it important?
[03:48:30.117 --> 03:48:31.358]  Because here's the deal.
[03:48:31.358 --> 03:48:42.805]  It says, first there's obviously a thought, you know, God has a thought, and then a word, a spoken, a vibration is spoken, and then something is created.
[03:48:42.805 --> 03:48:45.566]  And this is essentially what physics is telling us.
[03:48:45.566 --> 03:48:52.410]  That we are sort of a bunch of wave fronts coming together that we perceive as physical matter.
[03:48:52.410 --> 03:48:57.394]  And we perceive it through our sensory organism, the body, right?
[03:48:58.434 --> 03:48:59.754]  And let me tell you how we do that.
[03:48:59.754 --> 03:49:02.335]  Okay, for sight, for instance, it's a bandwidth.
[03:49:02.335 --> 03:49:18.078]  You look at the electromagnetic spectrum, which is this long line, if you can picture this line, with all the different things, x-rays, visible radiations, ultraviolet, electricity, you know, all of this stuff along the spectrum.
[03:49:18.078 --> 03:49:24.379]  And the visual system, our eyes, can see a bandwidth that allows us to see what we see, perceive what we see.
[03:49:25.302 --> 03:49:35.745]  And what we're really seeing is a certain amount of reflected light that we can construct with our brain into some kind of form, and that's what we do.
[03:49:35.745 --> 03:49:37.366]  With hearing, it's the same kind of thing.
[03:49:37.366 --> 03:49:48.509]  A sound wave vibrates, hits the inner ear and converts into a signal that we perceive as words or sounds that we translate and interpret according to what language we speak in the language.
[03:49:48.509 --> 03:49:51.410]  And a lot of other things transfer that we don't see.
[03:49:52.108 --> 03:49:59.396]  Between us as human beings that connect us uniquely better than the Internet.
[03:49:59.396 --> 03:50:09.146]  And this is what I was alluding to in the last segment was this connection is what the false sense of what we are is created.
[03:50:09.838 --> 03:50:12.320]  Because that's for the artificial, the Internet.
[03:50:12.320 --> 03:50:26.671]  If you think about it as connecting human beings, but with an intermediary, the operator of the system, as well as the government, the co-venturer, if you will, of the system, alright?
[03:50:26.671 --> 03:50:28.052]  Because they invented the Internet.
[03:50:28.052 --> 03:50:31.595]  Okay, so think about that as a way of tying consciousness together.
[03:50:31.595 --> 03:50:38.020]  And PBS did a special called The Worldwide Mind, where they say in a century, you know, this will all be electronically connected.
[03:50:39.096 --> 03:50:48.121]  No, I don't like any of that as a way of looking at humanity, if you will, because humanity is already connected this way, fundamentally.
[03:50:48.121 --> 03:50:58.006]  We're already hooked up to one another, if you will, and along with everything else in the universe, according to the most advanced theories in physics and quantum physics.
[03:50:58.006 --> 03:51:04.550]  And then there's all these really weird aspects of what we are as human beings that can be explained in lots of different
[03:51:05.240 --> 03:51:05.620]  I'm good.
[03:51:25.862 --> 03:51:40.274]  And this is why the reality creation model of the globalists and our New World Order, or whatever you want to call it, the devil, I mean, I don't care what you call it, the symbolism, the hidden meaning, whatever, is the same outcome.
[03:51:40.274 --> 03:51:44.157]  And that outcome is a corrupted humanity.
[03:51:44.157 --> 03:51:55.386]  A humanity that's lost itself in the illusion of connectedness through the internet, through mechanisms that really regulate, control, and manipulate speech.
[03:51:55.945 --> 03:52:02.131]  They do not free you to anything or provide you the freedom that you already are.
[03:52:02.131 --> 03:52:15.403]  And this is also what they tamp down in the human spirit by increasing anxiety, fear, tension, those very things that stop a human mind from reaching higher ordered thinking.
[03:52:16.545 --> 03:52:34.325]  And that leap beyond the higher ordered thinking into the realm of anomalous human potential that the military often referred to and used to be referred to in a lot of these programs under the name of extrasensory perception.
[03:52:35.186 --> 03:52:49.102]  And these studies, which I've reported on for years, and InfoWarsTore has my books and videos on mind control, mind effects, you can go there and you support this network when you do.
[03:52:49.102 --> 03:52:54.669]  But the thing about all this is, it's playing out now in a way that
[03:52:55.678 --> 03:53:00.300]  Many of us predicted and we anticipated and we put noted carefully.
[03:53:00.300 --> 03:53:10.204]  But you know, when you're in the reality versus writing about the future, you know, in terms of prediction models based on what you see in the technology trends, it's way different when you're in it.
[03:53:10.204 --> 03:53:14.005]  And now we're in it and it's way worse.
[03:53:14.005 --> 03:53:16.446]  But we have the potential of moving in the other direction.
[03:53:16.446 --> 03:53:18.147]  Let me give you a couple of ideas.
[03:53:18.972 --> 03:53:30.835]  One of them is, there was some work done in these programs that showed that if you could link people up, like we are right now, everyone listening right at this very moment, are linked together, and you could hold a thought
[03:53:31.428 --> 03:53:36.613]  It was the equivalent of some super duper, you know, try and hold a thought for more than a few seconds.
[03:53:36.613 --> 03:53:38.314]  Your mind drifts, right?
[03:53:38.314 --> 03:53:40.616]  It goes from that thought to the next one to the next one.
[03:53:40.616 --> 03:53:44.019]  And it's just the way the human mind kind of wanders around.
[03:53:44.019 --> 03:53:46.101]  You know, it's like you can't get it to sit still.
[03:53:46.101 --> 03:53:48.604]  It's like a two year old running around your house.
[03:53:48.604 --> 03:53:53.568]  And so your mind doesn't quiet the mind long enough to hold a thought is pretty challenging.
[03:53:53.568 --> 03:53:57.752]  And so, but what we know is the cumulative effect of holding that same thought
[03:53:58.762 --> 03:54:14.206]  Lays out neural pathways within the brain that then allow for the projection perhaps of that thought To take deeper and more meaningful form, but when you have a million people having a thought for a million seconds even well That's a million cumulative seconds.
[03:54:14.206 --> 03:54:19.667]  That's worth a lot of discipline on the part of one person You know holding a thought for three or four seconds if you're lucky
[03:54:20.595 --> 03:54:22.636]  So, I mean, the compound effect.
[03:54:22.636 --> 03:54:34.959]  So what I'm saying is if you can get the media to get enough people to see the reality the way they do, you can manifest that reality in a pretty direct and in an indirect way.
[03:54:34.959 --> 03:54:40.040]  And that's kind of part of that reality shaping thing that we get to do as humans.
[03:54:40.040 --> 03:54:44.361]  And most people don't do much of it because they're so unconscious.
[03:54:44.361 --> 03:54:46.962]  They just kind of get pushed along by whatever is pushing.
[03:54:47.640 --> 03:54:52.621]  The button, but as soon as emotion gets charged into it, then things start to happen.
[03:54:52.621 --> 03:54:55.002]  And so we need to be really responsible.
[03:54:55.002 --> 03:55:12.587]  And, you know, you think about emotion and how that plays into the dialogue in this century and how much tribalism is emerging in the debate to separate us from our humanity so that we speak against each other with the tone that doesn't represent
[03:55:13.408 --> 03:55:21.196]  Anyone or any human that believes in the idea created in the image of divinity.
[03:55:21.196 --> 03:55:25.220]  For goodness sake!
[03:55:25.220 --> 03:55:27.562]  That's what we've forgotten foundationally.
[03:55:27.562 --> 03:55:32.167]  And so, you know, we can pour a lot of energy into what we do, and we should.
[03:55:32.167 --> 03:55:35.170]  And we should do it collectively, independently.
[03:55:35.900 --> 03:55:40.944]  As individuals, we don't need to wait for some squishy group to form or some club to form.
[03:55:40.944 --> 03:55:44.347]  There's organizations that are great for getting information out.
[03:55:44.347 --> 03:55:45.588]  InfoWars is one of them.
[03:55:45.588 --> 03:55:47.489]  That's why you should support it.
[03:55:47.489 --> 03:55:52.473]  That's why people should look at the products and get those that support this network.
[03:55:52.473 --> 03:55:54.635]  And recognize that
[03:55:55.777 --> 03:55:58.019]  The war is our own individually.
[03:55:58.019 --> 03:55:59.981]  We all have a part to play in it.
[03:55:59.981 --> 03:56:03.064]  What we decide to do with it is up to us individually.
[03:56:03.064 --> 03:56:10.152]  You know, going in this weekend in Alaska, the longest day of the year.
[03:56:12.279 --> 03:56:22.185]  The lights are on and let's keep them lit for liberty and for a new democracy that really represents the Republic as it was originally intended.
[03:56:22.185 --> 03:56:27.849]  And let's take a look at what we're doing in the world and it's pull back.
[03:56:27.849 --> 03:56:30.091]  Pull back.
[03:56:30.091 --> 03:56:31.131]  Stand down.
[03:56:31.131 --> 03:56:38.156]  Let's take a look a little closer before we ever send our sons and daughters to war.
[03:56:38.156 --> 03:56:39.597]  That's not what America is about.
[03:56:39.597 --> 03:56:40.898]  We're about so much more than that.
[03:56:41.611 --> 03:56:46.874]  And take a look, you know, internally as to what we can do and start to do that.
[03:56:46.874 --> 03:56:49.796]  And I'm not saying each of us needs some big grand plan.
[03:56:49.796 --> 03:56:52.978]  There's plenty of plenty of those out there.
[03:56:52.978 --> 03:56:56.620]  But do the grand plan that you personally believe you can accomplish.
[03:56:57.180 --> 03:57:02.929]  And that's the one that's the right one for you as an info warrior in this together.
[03:57:02.929 --> 03:57:13.224]  You know, whatever step that is, talk to your neighbors, write a letter to your congressman, absolutely support this network, and go into the weekend refreshed knowing that
[03:57:13.923 --> 03:57:17.066]  You make a difference, as we all make a difference.
[03:57:17.066 --> 03:57:25.993]  You know, looking at what's going on in Iran and the Gulf, restraint, let's make sure it's not another false flag.
[03:57:25.993 --> 03:57:35.080]  And even if it is overt aggression, let's always ask the question, is it worth our sons and daughters before we launch the first counteroffensive?
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:40.465]  Hey, this is Dr. Nick Begich in the Info Wars, and you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:42.984 --> 03:57:47.165]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators.
[03:57:47.165 --> 03:57:48.225]  They are technocrats.
[03:57:48.225 --> 03:57:50.526]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:57:50.526 --> 03:57:57.868]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:57:57.868 --> 03:57:59.749]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:57:59.749 --> 03:58:02.209]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:58:02.209 --> 03:58:04.290]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:05.050]  I think so.
[03:58:23.883 --> 03:58:29.867]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B-12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[03:58:29.867 --> 03:58:30.808]  It is amazing.
[03:58:30.808 --> 03:58:40.795]  Experience pure medical model B-12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:58:44.252 --> 03:58:47.837]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:58:47.837 --> 03:58:49.620]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:58:49.620 --> 03:59:00.895]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:59:01.656 --> 03:59:10.866]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:59:10.866 --> 03:59:21.917]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:59:21.917 --> 03:59:24.160]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:59:24.520 --> 03:59:26.241]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:59:26.241 --> 03:59:36.224]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:59:36.224 --> 03:59:38.884]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:59:38.884 --> 03:59:47.607]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:59:47.607 --> 03:59:50.308]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
