[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:38.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.000 --> 00:46.800]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is the 31st day of March 2009 on this
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.600]  Tuesday edition we're gonna be here live for the next four hours we're gonna get a
[00:50.600 --> 00:55.520]  report coming up from Paul Joseph Watson in the UK on the G20 meetings
[00:55.520 --> 01:01.160]  coming up in Europe Obama is traveling to the UK tomorrow on April Fools to
[01:01.160 --> 01:06.960]  kneel before the Queen of England he's been practicing his etiquette and then
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.320]  of course he then goes on to the continent of Europe to openly set up
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.440]  world government ruled by the banks so I'll be breaking down everything ahead
[01:15.440 --> 01:20.840]  of the G20 meeting coming up Nicholas Sarkozy's threat to walk out of global
[01:20.840 --> 01:26.160]  summit if a global regulatory agency is not set up so he's pushing for the
[01:26.160 --> 01:31.320]  world government he says the Anglo-Saxon group the United States and England
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.480]  have engineered all of this well that's certainly true but France is integral
[01:37.480 --> 01:43.200]  part of that married into the entire power structure so this is like Herman
[01:43.200 --> 01:49.200]  Goering saying that Hitler is bad Joseph Gerbil saying that that Heinrich
[01:49.200 --> 01:56.200]  Himmler is bad this is just absolutely ridiculous also there are reports and the
[01:56.200 --> 01:59.760]  mainstream news one independent and others and Kurt Nemo has done a great
[01:59.760 --> 02:04.720]  report on an anarchist plot mayhem for G20 in London these are foundation backed
[02:04.720 --> 02:09.360]  groups now every time I mention that the anarchist or government paid shills I
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.200]  don't mean every anarchist group there are hundreds of these groups but the
[02:13.200 --> 02:19.840]  big ones that they fly around the world that they use in 99 in Seattle some of
[02:19.840 --> 02:23.160]  the groups they had in Denver some of the groups they had in Canada they've
[02:23.160 --> 02:27.840]  been caught over and over again in mainstream news being run by the police
[02:27.840 --> 02:33.840]  being run by security services and they attack other police generally led by
[02:33.840 --> 02:38.360]  police and then put it on the news to demonize all the peaceful protesters so
[02:38.360 --> 02:42.080]  that becomes the news instead of what the G20 is doing or what the North
[02:42.080 --> 02:46.080]  American Union SPP summit is doing or what's really going on the Democratic
[02:46.080 --> 02:50.600]  National Convention or what's happening at the World Trade Organization in
[02:50.600 --> 02:58.640]  Genoa Italy or Seattle Washington and I saw on the Times of London it says
[02:58.640 --> 03:03.640]  protest the protest annoyed by the G20 riots have a rant about it that's
[03:03.640 --> 03:08.120]  below the Sarkozy story on their link to it where you know they're oh look at
[03:08.120 --> 03:13.000]  this rabble you know the the capitalist bankers are trying to fix it but the
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.400]  dirty anarchist they aren't and in all of these labels are incorrect the big
[03:20.400 --> 03:24.360]  central banks are not capitalist they're feaving robber barons that create
[03:24.360 --> 03:29.160]  fiat assets and buy everything up that's real with it and then basically
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.000]  bankrupt the economy to grab up what they don't have so they're not
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.040]  capitalist they're criminal pirates and the anarchist every time you go out to
[03:36.040 --> 03:40.240]  the really bad ones that are flown in and paid for by foundations on record I
[03:40.240 --> 03:44.720]  made a whole film about it police state to the takeover with them admitting it
[03:44.720 --> 03:48.600]  local newscast admitting it the news police admitting it police angry that
[03:48.600 --> 03:52.920]  they were told to stand down by Delta Force led anarchists yes Seattle post
[03:52.920 --> 03:58.360]  intelligence or Seattle weekly Delta Force you know Cheney's private hit rings
[03:58.360 --> 04:03.680]  hit teams hit wing as they're now calling it well it isn't just Cheney
[04:03.680 --> 04:10.160]  it's been going on since 1979 and they were there leading the 50 anarchists who
[04:10.160 --> 04:13.000]  were housed and protected by the government next door to the police
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.920]  station and they go out and attack the police the police are told to stand down
[04:16.920 --> 04:20.680]  and then the media says why won't the police do anything and a day later they
[04:20.680 --> 04:27.560]  say okay attack the 60,000 peaceful demonstrators I mean this is a fact an
[04:27.560 --> 04:32.040]  absolute fact not in triplicate not in quadruplicate but in hundreds of confirmed
[04:32.040 --> 04:37.840]  reports now we're gonna go into that but even bigger is something in mainstream

[08:06.120 --> 08:09.080]  radio network
[08:09.080 --> 08:32.240]  all right here is one most important stories of the day five years ago the
[08:32.240 --> 08:40.920]  republicans and democrats change the pension rules to state that private
[08:40.920 --> 08:52.160]  companies no longer have any obligation to ever actually pay on the pensions and
[08:52.160 --> 08:56.240]  they changed a bunch of other rules where they can invest in speculative things
[08:56.240 --> 09:04.000]  like derivatives and that whole class of fraud and at that point we began to see
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.080]  major companies default on pensions or make deals through the unions or through
[09:09.080 --> 09:18.880]  their employee groups to cut them now here is the boston globe from yesterday
[09:18.880 --> 09:28.960]  by michael cranish concern increases as losses melt failing plans could overwhelm
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.160]  agency just months before the start of last year stock market collapse the
[09:35.160 --> 09:40.600]  federal agency that ensures the retirement funds of 44 million americans
[09:40.600 --> 09:46.600]  departed from its conservative investment strategy and decided to put much of
[09:46.600 --> 09:53.560]  its 64 billion insurance fund into stocks now it's also come out for the
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.320]  last 15 years the fdic was supposed to by federal law the federal deposit
[09:59.320 --> 10:05.080]  insurance corporation to go out and to make banks put a very small percentage
[10:05.080 --> 10:13.800]  of their deposits into the insurance corporation and now we learn that they
[10:13.800 --> 10:17.680]  haven't been doing that and that's why the fdic is already bankrupt if they
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.080]  don't get another couple hundred billion now with more and more banks and
[10:21.080 --> 10:31.000]  insurance companies and brokerage firms going under so they you've heard about
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.120]  harvard and Yale and all the other major universities losing 20 30 40 percent of
[10:36.120 --> 10:43.120]  their portfolios not just their retiree funds but their general funds they've
[10:43.120 --> 10:48.320]  been investing in so understand ladies and gentlemen your savings your
[10:48.320 --> 10:53.400]  retirement if it's in big mutual funds or ira's most of it has been fed into
[10:53.400 --> 11:00.400]  derivatives so even if the stock market was to go back up for a time which it's
[11:00.400 --> 11:04.840]  plunged couple hundred points yesterday it doesn't matter because that's just a
[11:04.840 --> 11:12.680]  average of the top 30 blue chip stocks and so they manipulate those numbers it's
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.920]  not a true bellwether or gauge of what's happening so just months before the
[11:18.920 --> 11:21.960]  start of last year's stock market collapse the federal agency that
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.560]  ensures the retirement funds of 44 million americans departed from its
[11:26.560 --> 11:30.640]  conservative investment strategy and decided to put much of its 64 billion
[11:30.640 --> 11:37.040]  insurance fund in the stocks switching away from heavy reliance on bonds which
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.000]  you know guarantee five six seven percent the pension benefit guarantee
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  corporation decided to pour billions of dollars into speculative investment
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.080]  such as stocks in emerging foreign markets real estate and private equity
[11:50.080 --> 11:55.480]  funds a lot of that was derivatives the agency refused to say how much of the
[11:55.480 --> 12:01.480]  new investment strategy has been implemented or how much the fund has
[12:01.480 --> 12:09.360]  fared during the downturn the agency would only say that its fund was down
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.720]  six point five percent and all of its stock related investments were down
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.760]  twenty three percent as of last September 30th the end of the fiscal year so
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.480]  that's three months ago no September that's not just the end of last year it's
[12:22.480 --> 12:29.600]  September so October November December talking five months January February
[12:29.600 --> 12:35.320]  March six months and then most of the real sinking has happened since then the
[12:35.320 --> 12:39.400]  market was down twenty something percent then so they were down twenty three percent now it's
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.040]  down by upwards of fifty percent so we can safely say it's fifty percent
[12:43.040 --> 12:48.520]  reduction all of its stock related investments were down twenty three percent
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.080]  as of last September 30th the end of its fiscal year but that was before most of
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.760]  the recent stock market decline and just before the investment switch was
[12:56.760 --> 13:09.000]  scheduled to begin in earnest so they took the federal insurance back by
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.080]  taxpayers and right when they knew derivatives bubble was imploding they
[13:12.080 --> 13:16.680]  pumped that all in you like that huh right when they knew it was all going
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.720]  down they pumped it in they took your money and they did that no statistics on
[13:21.720 --> 13:25.760]  the fund subsequent performance were released now notice the feds are saying
[13:25.760 --> 13:28.960]  we won't tell you what's going on just like the private fellow reserve goes
[13:28.960 --> 13:32.480]  before the Senate in the house and says we're not going to tell you we're above
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.640]  government we're above the law the president the congress no court no
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.680]  agency can ask us any questions but give us twelve trillion dollars they've
[13:41.680 --> 13:48.200]  already gobbled that in less than six months since October 3rd I mean you
[13:48.200 --> 13:52.680]  understand what's happening you think things are bad now that's why the army
[13:52.680 --> 13:56.040]  standing by that's why they're setting up a police state because their criminals
[13:56.040 --> 14:00.440]  they have robbed all of us the only hope out of this is to identify them as
[14:00.440 --> 14:05.040]  criminals and have them arrested and then have trials and they will turn states
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.520]  evidence and it will all come out we can have a peaceful revolution and start
[14:08.520 --> 14:12.280]  reversing this but of course that won't happen the yuppies feel like they're part
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.000]  of the establishment they will go down with the ship and take all of us with
[14:16.000 --> 14:23.280]  them and all the Kool-Aid drinking Obama supporters will as well nonetheless
[14:23.280 --> 14:26.840]  analysts express concern that large portions the trust fund might have been
[14:26.840 --> 14:30.840]  lost at a time when many private pension plans are suffering major losses the
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.600]  guaranteed fund would be the only way to recover the plans if the companies go
[14:34.600 --> 14:41.080]  into bankruptcy the truth is this could be huge said zivi boaty at boston
[14:41.080 --> 14:45.080]  university finance professor who in 2002 advised the agency to rely almost
[14:45.080 --> 14:48.880]  entirely on bonds this has the potential to be another several hundred
[14:48.880 --> 14:52.680]  billion dollars if the auto companies go under they have huge unfunded
[14:52.680 --> 14:56.680]  liabilities and see what is obama said he says they're gonna pay at least part
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.080]  of your pension and they're going to reduce your health care and they're
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.520]  going to do you take a little bit control gm they said step down you're
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.320]  fired we're putting in a c.o. will do what we say unprecedented literal
[15:10.320 --> 15:16.000]  financial dictatorship by the president himself a complete puppet of the
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.800]  private offshore banks this has the potential to be another several hundred
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.400]  billion dollars of the auto companies go under they have huge unfunded
[15:24.400 --> 15:29.520]  liabilities in pension plans that would be passed on to the agency see what
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.600]  happened in reading on the boston globe here what happened is and the imf
[15:34.600 --> 15:37.360]  world bank of bankrupt hundreds of third world countries they go and buy off the
[15:37.360 --> 15:41.680]  government's have a sign on 25% loan sharking rates a billion dollars turns
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.400]  into 50 billion dollars in just a decade you know the so so you get a
[15:46.400 --> 15:49.920]  billion dollar loan of your nigeria argentina or two billion dollar loan it
[15:49.920 --> 15:57.200]  turns into 45 50 60 billion dollars paid to private banks with original u.s.
[15:57.200 --> 16:01.240]  taxpayer money that's predominantly with the iron of the world bank gets about
[16:01.240 --> 16:04.720]  half its money and then they take your tax money they go loaned at loan
[16:04.720 --> 16:11.320]  sharking rates and then the private banks get the 49 billion that is paid
[16:11.320 --> 16:15.640]  back on the 1 billion in the decade and the country's totally enslaved and our
[16:15.640 --> 16:19.720]  nation's enslaved but the bankers said hey and the rand corporation talks
[16:19.720 --> 16:24.280]  about this british ministry of defense 2007 prospectus on the future holds with
[16:24.280 --> 16:27.520]  what the army war college says with professor thomas barnett the naval war
[16:27.520 --> 16:31.240]  college says is they openly work for this international cartel the military
[16:31.240 --> 16:34.800]  works for them and that's why they've geared up the police in the fema camps
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.040]  and all of this because when they steal everything you've got you're gonna get
[16:38.040 --> 16:44.520]  angry and they're gonna drop the police down on you like a big fat hammer when a
[16:44.520 --> 16:48.560]  criminal robs a liquor store or robs a department store or robs your house they
[16:48.560 --> 16:54.240]  come in with a gun and they say get on the floor i'm gonna put you in i'm gonna
[16:54.240 --> 17:00.320]  bounce your hands that's what north com is it's the handcuffs so they tie you up
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.640]  they hog tie your legs and hands with homeland security they stayed some terror
[17:04.640 --> 17:08.880]  attacks so they can sell it they hog tie you get you on the ground and then
[17:08.880 --> 17:12.560]  they're walking out with everything in front of you that's the new world order
[17:12.560 --> 17:20.880]  it's real simple so let me give you the newsflash they took your pension funds
[17:20.880 --> 17:24.720]  they took the pension fund insurance federal money they took the university
[17:24.720 --> 17:29.480]  funds and they pumped it in the last decade into these Ponzi schemes and
[17:29.480 --> 17:36.360]  leveraged trillions into 1.5 quadrillion 1,500 trillion that's even been in
[17:36.360 --> 17:40.520]  mainstream news that it's over 1,000 trillion a lot of the economists we talk
[17:40.520 --> 17:44.840]  to say it's over 1.5 let's just say 1,000 trillion and they bought up
[17:44.840 --> 17:51.200]  everything with that see now in the name of bailing it out they're engorging even
[17:51.200 --> 17:55.160]  more cash while cutting off credit liquidity to further shut down the
[17:55.160 --> 18:01.200]  economy so they can buy it all up and we better get this message out to people
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.800]  or it's only gonna get worse and worse so let me give you a newsflash unless you
[18:06.800 --> 18:11.560]  politically get angry and discredit both the republicans and the democrats who

[18:15.400 --> 18:20.000]  hope of coming out of this in any way total world government feudalism and

[18:44.760 --> 18:49.480]  with this guy oh we were really concerned about this when they engineered it in
[18:49.480 --> 18:53.360]  addition head of the white house office of budget management budget has serious
[18:53.360 --> 18:57.240]  concerns about the agency according to an obama administration spokesman last
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.720]  year's director of the congressional budget office or zag expressed alarm at
[19:01.720 --> 19:05.720]  the agency was investing a greater share of its assets and risky securities
[19:05.720 --> 19:10.240]  which he said would make it more likely to experience the client and the value
[19:10.240 --> 19:15.240]  of the portfolio during an economic downturn the point at which is most
[19:15.240 --> 19:19.680]  likely to have an assumed responsibility for a larger number of underfunded
[19:19.680 --> 19:23.720]  pension plans so just with this one fifty-something or sixty four billion they
[19:23.720 --> 19:28.800]  gobbled they then took that money did credit default swaps and about five
[19:28.800 --> 19:32.840]  other levels of pyramid schemes just made up paper ensuring it they all got
[19:32.840 --> 19:40.840]  bonuses on those in the tens of billions and the money went into a black hole see
[19:40.840 --> 19:46.640]  how that works meanwhile limbaugh says it's free market to let the bankers do

[22:10.120 --> 22:16.160]  powerful just as strong just as well funded the Obama deception completely

[22:19.960 --> 22:25.240]  people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since day one in this election if

[24:32.160 --> 24:49.960]  day all right we are back live finishing up with this pension fund
[24:49.960 --> 25:03.960]  story now listen to how they spin this that was a mistake the government made
[25:03.960 --> 25:09.960]  even though they were told not to do it to take the 64 billion insurance fund
[25:09.960 --> 25:17.880]  paid for by taxpayers to ensure pension funds however Charles E. F. Millard the
[25:17.880 --> 25:22.000]  former agency director implemented the strategy until the Bush administration
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.640]  departed on January 20th this meant such concerns Miller to former managing
[25:25.640 --> 25:29.400]  director of Lehman Brothers said flatly that the new investment policy is not
[25:29.400 --> 25:32.720]  riskier than the old one yeah investing in derivatives is not more risky than
[25:32.720 --> 25:36.760]  buying bonds that are safe he said the previous strategy of relying mostly on
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.720]  bonds would never garner enough money to eliminate the agency's deficit so it's
[25:40.720 --> 25:45.240]  like a gambler oh I'm down I better just put it all on the tables all on the all
[25:45.240 --> 25:49.560]  on the crap table or the roulette wheel the prior policy virtually guaranteed
[25:49.560 --> 25:52.840]  that some day a multi-billion dollar bailout would be required for
[25:52.840 --> 25:57.040]  congress millard said he said he believed the new policy which includes such
[25:57.040 --> 26:00.560]  potentially high growth investments as foreign stocks in private real estate
[26:00.560 --> 26:04.920]  would lessen but not eliminate the possibility that a bailout is needed so
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.320]  you get the government buying real estate ask whether the strategy was a
[26:08.320 --> 26:12.240]  mistake given the subsequent declines in stocks in real estate Miller to ask ask
[26:12.240 --> 26:16.240]  me in 20 years this is their arrogance the question is whether policy makers
[26:16.240 --> 26:22.600]  will have the fortitude to stick with it but Bodie the BU professor who advised
[26:22.600 --> 26:26.040]  the agency question why a government entity that is supposed to be insuring
[26:26.040 --> 26:30.240]  pension funds would be investing in stocks in real estate at all Bodie wants
[26:30.240 --> 26:34.760]  like in the agency's strategy to a company that insures against hurricane
[26:34.760 --> 26:40.640]  damage and then invest the premiums in beachfront property well ladies and
[26:40.640 --> 26:43.680]  gentlemen I just read you the first part of the article where they said they
[26:43.680 --> 26:48.840]  won't say where they invested that's a secret the government is just a compact
[26:48.840 --> 26:54.320]  of made-off criminals stealing everything that's what they do we have been
[26:54.320 --> 26:58.240]  robbed there in the they know it's all imploding by design so the the the
[26:58.240 --> 27:06.040]  thieving has accelerated and the article goes on and on and on since he issued
[27:06.040 --> 27:09.120]  that warning he said the agency has gone even more aggressively into stocks
[27:09.120 --> 27:12.840]  which he called totally crazy the agents know it's not totally crazy they're
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.120]  stealing it all that's what they were put in power for the agency's action has
[27:17.120 --> 27:20.280]  also been questioned by the government accountability office investigative arm
[27:20.280 --> 27:24.560]  of congress which concluded that the strategy will likely carry more risk and
[27:24.560 --> 27:28.600]  projected by the agency we felt they weren't acknowledging the increased risk
[27:28.600 --> 27:35.360]  said Barbara D. Bob a jerk at the geos director of education workforce and
[27:35.360 --> 27:44.760]  income security issues yeah the general accounting office and others as well as
[27:44.760 --> 27:48.200]  a governmental accountability office have all said it was illegal when bush
[27:48.200 --> 27:53.080]  spent tens of billions a year in fake news packages and propaganda now obama
[27:53.080 --> 27:56.960]  has basically tripled that forty something million for the Pentagon to have
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.280]  domestic international propaganda buying off news media paying for product
[28:01.280 --> 28:07.240]  placement movies t.v. media it's propaganda classic paid for covert
[28:07.240 --> 28:11.800]  propaganda and now obama is spending billions of dollars in the first few
[28:11.800 --> 28:18.040]  months in office putting up federally paid for t.v. ads for u.s.a. service and
[28:18.040 --> 28:23.400]  others which then advertised to join the federal government in volunteerism and
[28:23.400 --> 28:29.600]  then it's a private group run by the democratic party
[28:29.600 --> 28:32.640]  this is all felonies
[28:32.640 --> 28:36.600]  the g.a.o. has documented going back five years ago all every time they do
[28:36.600 --> 28:42.440]  this it's a felony they just don't care it's illegal
[28:42.440 --> 28:47.400]  to take taxpayer money and run t.v. radio and print ads
[28:47.400 --> 28:50.480]  saying join obama in his
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.680]  army of volunteers as the quote from cnn and the white house
[28:54.680 --> 28:57.760]  and it's paid for with tax money
[28:57.760 --> 29:02.640]  i mean that just total criminality total lawlessness i keep repeating that
[29:02.640 --> 29:06.520]  because that's all this is
[29:06.520 --> 29:09.240]  and they're going for broke they've committed so many crimes ladies and
[29:09.240 --> 29:12.280]  gentlemen that's why they top the last crimes
[29:12.280 --> 29:17.680]  dot their previous heights every day every week every month because they're
[29:17.680 --> 29:20.840]  going for broke they know they've committed so many crimes unless they
[29:20.840 --> 29:23.960]  bring in a total police state dictatorship of the national security
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.240]  council and bring us under world government regulatory control they're
[29:27.240 --> 29:29.600]  not going to get away with this you understand
[29:29.600 --> 29:31.400]  they've already robbed the bank

[29:33.480 --> 29:35.560]  and uh...
[29:35.560 --> 29:38.840]  it just goes from bad to worse

[33:06.440 --> 33:17.200]  the GCN radio network last Tuesday I played some clips from the European
[33:17.200 --> 33:24.260]  Parliament with multiple members of the British members of the European
[33:24.260 --> 33:33.680]  Parliament MEP's as they're called kind of a collage of those clips and I meant
[33:33.680 --> 33:40.760]  to get to this longer clip of Daniel Hannon who really put Gordon Brown on
[33:40.760 --> 33:44.960]  the spot and Brown sat there with a goblin like smile while he was being
[33:44.960 --> 33:50.840]  skewered and I knew this was key information last week I never got
[33:50.840 --> 33:54.000]  around actually playing the full clip we're gonna do that now it's a huge
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.560]  viral video tens of millions of views all over the internet I mean there's
[33:57.560 --> 34:01.280]  you know copies with two million views million a half views three million views
[34:01.280 --> 34:06.000]  so folks are really waking up but in his full speech because this was just his
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.640]  his comments at Brown you know he gets into the new world order world
[34:10.640 --> 34:15.440]  government European Union undemocratic trying to take over England this is
[34:15.440 --> 34:20.680]  openly discussed in England and in Europe proper now here in the United
[34:20.680 --> 34:24.200]  States we would try to talk about how the European Union was saying they would
[34:24.200 --> 34:28.840]  arrest you if you criticized them and basically no free speech and how they
[34:28.840 --> 34:33.080]  celebrated in 2007 their 50th anniversary I thought the European Union
[34:33.080 --> 34:37.360]  started in 2000 why they celebrate their 50th anniversary from the Treaty of
[34:37.360 --> 34:45.880]  Rome in 1957 when they officially were set up well it's the same thing here if
[34:45.880 --> 34:51.640]  they if they're successful years from now they'll be celebrating the 10th
[34:51.640 --> 34:58.120]  anniversary the 20th anniversary they'll be celebrating the 10th anniversary in
[34:58.120 --> 35:07.520]  2015 for the North American Union and people will be like the 10th anniversary
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.480]  of it we didn't even know we had one they officially have rose garden press
[35:12.480 --> 35:16.880]  conferences saying they've merged the North American Union with the European
[35:16.880 --> 35:22.520]  Union with George Bush Merkel and Barroso all up there you know the leaders
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.400]  the European Union the German Chancellor and President Bush judicial watch
[35:26.400 --> 35:29.680]  Susan gets all the documents how it's a union how they're merging everything
[35:29.680 --> 35:33.520]  taking our rights away see when they abolish your nation-states true
[35:33.520 --> 35:36.960]  sovereignty and then they're just kind of ceremonial they get to set up the new
[35:36.960 --> 35:40.400]  system where you don't have to process our liberties or freedoms or a second
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.840]  amendment or property rights or any of it and we're under this that's why
[35:45.840 --> 35:50.480]  Obama can't allow under these world government regulations any of the
[35:50.480 --> 35:55.680]  stimulus money to be spent here in the United States they can't direct that the
[35:55.680 --> 36:02.880]  bids be put out and only given to the u.s. companies because it's globalist so
[36:02.880 --> 36:06.080]  meanwhile they're admitting that the world government's being set up over
[36:06.080 --> 36:11.760]  there and that world regulatory system Bank of the World taxes to be paid to
[36:11.760 --> 36:14.480]  the private banks
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.760]  but you talk about it here for decades they preconditioned the public crazy
[36:22.760 --> 36:28.840]  people talk about the new world order the new world order doesn't exist and then
[36:28.840 --> 36:35.440]  they had their operatives out there who would mix serious documents bills news
[36:35.440 --> 36:40.760]  stories in with cuba cabras and things like that and abominable snowmen and all
[36:40.760 --> 36:46.400]  of that so then it all gets discredited and so that's what the average person
[36:46.400 --> 36:56.520]  thinks of this is all been done via a strategy and it's very very sad very
[36:56.520 --> 37:02.720]  very sad so there is a world government we are now deeply into it they
[37:02.720 --> 37:09.760]  officially founded the North American Union up in Waco Texas at Baylor
[37:09.760 --> 37:20.360]  University March 24 2005 and we have to grow up and be adults in-game blueprint
[37:20.360 --> 37:23.520]  for global enslavement details at all shows the video clip shows the
[37:23.520 --> 37:28.600]  documents and people had to sue to get these documents you judicial watching
[37:28.600 --> 37:32.400]  others congress asked for them until you're not allowed to have see congress
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.120]  is co-equal to the president but no no you can't see this just like they've
[37:36.120 --> 37:40.800]  signed all these deals last five years use Canadian Mexican you check Republic
[37:40.800 --> 37:45.440]  Ukrainian troops here in the United States it's all over the Canadian and
[37:45.440 --> 37:51.040]  British press hardly ever in our press to use foreign troops and last year they
[37:51.040 --> 37:54.440]  signed a bunch of public ones at press conferences and congress said hey we
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.880]  should be involved in that they said no not under PDD 51 you are buddy the
[37:59.880 --> 38:04.160]  president for any economic or other emergency can do whatever he wants and
[38:04.160 --> 38:09.360]  we're under this right now we're in a state of emergency so we're in martial
[38:09.360 --> 38:17.480]  law it's just what degree of that on a Richter scale of one to ten this
[38:17.480 --> 38:23.160]  country it has been taken over it isn't being taken over and that's why the
[38:23.160 --> 38:25.840]  bankers don't care that's why the Federal Reserve will go on layer news hour
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.000]  go before the Congress and say look we're above the law no one can even
[38:29.000 --> 38:32.000]  investigate us no one could look at anything we say or do I mean think of
[38:32.000 --> 38:41.200]  the magnitude of that alone so I wanted to play Daniel Hannon British member of
[38:41.200 --> 38:49.080]  the European Parliament then we're gonna play BBC host Max Kaiser talking
[38:49.080 --> 38:52.480]  about the fact that they've openly announced the Russians the Chinese the
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.360]  European Union are all saying go to a global currency the IMF World Bank are
[38:56.360 --> 38:59.640]  already issuing the global currency it's in the BBC it's in the London
[38:59.640 --> 39:03.800]  Telegraph it's even in the Wall Street Journal but Rush Limbaugh says it
[39:03.800 --> 39:10.960]  doesn't exist I was listening to Alan Cones last night driving home on XM and
[39:10.960 --> 39:14.720]  a caller called in and asked about it now and comes said it doesn't exist
[39:14.720 --> 39:21.600]  super currency is a conspiracy theory it liberals conservatives they all work on
[39:21.600 --> 39:25.760]  the same team to keep people in the dark about the real world and we endlessly
[39:25.760 --> 39:31.680]  debate the two-party system so here is a Daniel Hannon British member of the
[39:31.680 --> 39:35.360]  European Parliament and the video is even more powerful you can Google it we
[39:35.360 --> 39:40.040]  wrote stories about it in four words dot com just Google Daniel Hannon Gordon
[39:40.040 --> 39:47.320]  Brown and it'll come up for you the video because the whole time Gordon Brown is
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.360]  laughing at him because just like Obama when he was on 60 minutes they're like
[39:52.360 --> 39:53.920]  everything's in blood everything's falling apart
[39:53.920 --> 39:56.880]  Obama shirts giggling and laughing minute after minute and finally the hostess
[39:56.880 --> 40:02.160]  are you punch-drunk is this funny and and and it was actually real because the
[40:02.160 --> 40:08.440]  the the interviewer was kind of shaken up because it's bizarre but see this is
[40:08.440 --> 40:12.840]  the arrogant attitude they have to act like it's totally normal like thieves
[40:12.840 --> 40:15.400]  come in your house grabbing your jewelry and your television set your
[40:15.400 --> 40:18.000]  computer and you say what are you doing they just laugh at you say oh nothing
[40:18.000 --> 40:22.360]  huh and laugh at you this is the criminality it's come out in the
[40:22.360 --> 40:27.760]  Associated Press that most of the recipients of bonuses and money the
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.320]  trillions of dollars 12 trillion already pumped out don't pay taxes period
[40:32.320 --> 40:36.440]  most members of Congress don't pay taxes Geithner was told a year and a half ago
[40:36.440 --> 40:41.600]  to pay him and said I don't have to it's coming out all these big IRS agents
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.760]  don't pay taxes that's all over the news today governors legislatures don't pay
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.880]  taxes they are a criminal class this is what happens 99% of the time in history
[40:51.880 --> 40:58.320]  criminals take control if you don't bound down government keep it very small it
[40:58.320 --> 41:02.360]  will team up with private groups of pirates robber barons and it will take
[41:02.360 --> 41:09.160]  you over and so people say oh politicians lie that's just what they do
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.280]  to the public kind of got conditioned that was normal if you support Bush it's
[41:13.280 --> 41:16.200]  okay when he lies or does stuff you support Clinton it's okay when he lies
[41:16.200 --> 41:19.720]  because you know he's your guy and Obama he's gone back on all his promises the
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.920]  liberals I talked to yeah he has but he has to you know he's got a compromise but
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.040]  I thought it was change it was going to be different no lobbyist in the war you
[41:29.040 --> 41:37.440]  know Obama he's fighting the huge bonuses and it turns out he wrote the
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.440]  executive order had died right the bill to allow it then he says he knows
[41:41.440 --> 41:46.080]  nothing about it I mean just lying scamming and thieving and then I see
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.640]  these headlines all over CNN all over Fox it's racist if you don't like Obama
[41:50.640 --> 41:59.000]  has nothing to do with it I mean the guy's half white and then he's three
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.600]  quarters Arab and one quote one quarter of that half so he's half white three
[42:05.600 --> 42:09.440]  quarters Arab and one quarter Kenyan what does that make him I mean I call him
[42:09.440 --> 42:12.560]  an Arab I call him a white guy he's certainly not a black guy I could care
[42:12.560 --> 42:16.920]  I'm sick of this junior high thing oh I don't like Obama continuing the war
[42:16.920 --> 42:23.560]  teacher he doesn't like black people well let me just tell the white people in
[42:23.560 --> 42:26.680]  the black people something and the Mexicans and everybody else you're in
[42:26.680 --> 42:31.280]  the same boat with holes in it and the bankers are sailing off in a luxury
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.120]  liner you're in the middle of the North Atlantic with icebergs around you
[42:34.120 --> 42:40.400]  seconds in that water you'll freeze to death plunging into hardcore depression
[42:40.400 --> 42:45.840]  this is only that we've only begun the descent into tyranny
[42:45.840 --> 42:49.960]  I'm gonna give you a newsflash they're going to take most of your pensions
[42:49.960 --> 42:53.400]  they're gonna federalize it and give you a pence on your little federal card
[42:53.400 --> 42:56.520]  you're all gonna be going on basically welfare they're gonna call your own
[42:56.520 --> 43:00.560]  money welfare but they're openly announcing this and it doesn't matter
[43:00.560 --> 43:05.720]  what color you are you're going to be robbed see they got black bank robbers
[43:05.720 --> 43:11.000]  and they got white bank robbers they got Asian bank robbers they got Mexican
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.320]  bank robbers see and while they've got us like little children debating what

[43:27.240 --> 43:31.280]  up with the government shipping in drugs the drug war gets bigger and bigger more
[43:31.280 --> 43:34.400]  people in prison more drugs on the streets they say well why not expand it
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.040]  why not start restricting people's home gardens why not boss everybody around
[43:39.040 --> 43:43.280]  why not raise hundreds of new taxes why not you know Obama comes in says only
[43:43.280 --> 43:45.880]  taxes on those making a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a piece
[43:45.880 --> 43:51.720]  more two hundred and fifty thousand total per couple he's raising all these new
[43:51.720 --> 43:55.760]  carbon taxes regulations changing the whole tax code to get rid of all these
[43:55.760 --> 44:01.120]  exemptions on education exemptions on your house exemptions on equipment believe
[44:01.120 --> 44:04.480]  me I got an office I got 20-something employees I know the tax code and let me
[44:04.480 --> 44:09.560]  tell you they're getting rid of all of it nothing no exemptions taxes on

[44:25.440 --> 44:29.680]  giggling smiling know-it-all arrogant yuppies and the arrogant Barack Obama
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.040]  supporters and the arrogant know-it-alls it you know send me hundreds of emails a
[44:34.040 --> 44:37.880]  day you know you you're just a racist you don't like black people listen you

[44:52.840 --> 44:59.880]  Latin America he's a eugenicist he doesn't like you he's an actor he's a punk
[44:59.880 --> 45:05.280]  and the sooner you figure that out the sooner we're gonna turn this around
[45:05.280 --> 45:14.800]  we're looking at a cross between Soviet Russia Maoist China Nazi Germany East
[45:14.800 --> 45:20.480]  Germany under the Soviets we're looking at an amalgamation of that with a mixture
[45:20.480 --> 45:26.080]  of race warfare in in the whole thing so we've proven we know what we talking
[45:26.080 --> 45:30.640]  about I've made films that decades later come through we do we study this this
[45:30.640 --> 45:35.400]  is what we do okay there's no more time to deny the world government there's no
[45:35.400 --> 45:40.120]  more time to deny the criminal takeover grow up now and then have respect for
[45:40.120 --> 45:45.560]  yourself have respect for yourself to fight this to go to city councils where
[45:45.560 --> 45:48.680]  you can be on local cable and the news will pick you up and speak about the
[45:48.680 --> 45:53.000]  FEMA camp speak about the how this how your cities and counties have invested

[46:08.200 --> 46:12.800]  propaganda war that's why they're out there pushing start an access TV show

[46:16.920 --> 46:25.480]  there people are now ready to listen get bold recognize the threat we always
[46:25.480 --> 46:29.000]  knew people would get moving when the new order finally closed the gates when it
[46:29.000 --> 46:34.560]  finally went into full bore new order operation and now people are ready to
[46:34.560 --> 46:38.720]  listen so but but you got to do more than just listen you got to get involved
[46:38.720 --> 46:41.880]  and take action and you know all I could do is report this stuff and break down
[46:41.880 --> 46:45.520]  what they're doing people see me as some leader out there with the standard at
[46:45.520 --> 46:49.960]  the front no all I can do is enough to just study this constantly and tell you
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.440]  what's happening we give you solutions state sovereignty block the feds that
[46:53.440 --> 46:59.360]  way go for the arrest of the private bankers take over your local governments
[46:59.360 --> 47:08.240]  you cut taxes get the economy going all of this stuff but at the same time to
[47:08.240 --> 47:11.920]  then get those solutions implemented the new order can't get away with any of
[47:11.920 --> 47:16.960]  this if you go along with it you've got to go along with it for them to be
[47:16.960 --> 47:22.320]  successful they got to have you acquiesce they got to have you stand out
[47:22.320 --> 47:27.760]  let's play the clip of a Daniel Hannon here it is Prime Minister I see you've
[47:27.760 --> 47:32.120]  already mastered the essential craft of the European politician namely the
[47:32.120 --> 47:35.840]  ability to say one thing in this chamber and a very different thing to your home
[47:35.840 --> 47:40.600]  electorate you've spoken here about free trade and our men to that who would have
[47:40.600 --> 47:43.960]  guessed listening to you just now that you were the author of the phrase
[47:43.960 --> 47:47.520]  British jobs for British workers and that you have subsidized where you have
[47:47.520 --> 47:52.680]  not nationalized outright suites of our economy including the car industry and
[47:52.680 --> 47:57.400]  many of the banks perhaps you would have more moral authority in this house if
[47:57.400 --> 48:03.000]  your actions matched your words perhaps you would have more legitimacy in the
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.280]  councils of the world if the United Kingdom were not going into this
[48:06.280 --> 48:12.960]  recession in the worst condition of any G20 country the truth Prime Minister is
[48:12.960 --> 48:19.480]  that you have run out of our money the country as a whole is now in negative
[48:19.480 --> 48:26.680]  equity every British child is born owing around 20,000 pounds servicing the
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.640]  interest on that debt is going to cost more than educating the child now once
[48:31.640 --> 48:34.840]  again today you try to spread the blame around you spoke about an international
[48:34.840 --> 48:40.000]  recession international crisis well it is true that we are all sailing together
[48:40.000 --> 48:46.120]  into the squalls but not every vessel in the convoy is in the same dilapidated
[48:46.120 --> 48:51.520]  condition other ships used the good years to caulk their hulls and clear their
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.080]  rigging in other words to pay off debt but you use the good years to raise
[48:56.080 --> 49:03.120]  borrowing yet further as a consequence under your captaincy our hull is pressed
[49:03.120 --> 49:07.920]  deep into the waterline under the accumulated weight of your debt we are
[49:07.920 --> 49:12.960]  now running a deficit that touches 10% of GDP an almost unbelievable figure more
[49:12.960 --> 49:16.920]  than Pakistan more than Hungary countries where the IMF has already been
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.280]  called in now it's not that you're not apologizing like everyone else I've
[49:22.280 --> 49:26.680]  long accepted the your pathologically incapable of accepting responsibility for
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.680]  these things it's that you're carrying on willfully worsening our situation
[49:30.680 --> 49:36.120]  wantonly spending what little we have left last year in the last 12 months a
[49:36.120 --> 49:40.120]  hundred thousand private sector jobs have been lost and yet you created 30
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.720]  thousand public sector jobs Prime Minister you cannot carry on forever
[49:44.720 --> 49:49.920]  squeezing the productive bit of the economy in order to fund an unprecedented
[49:49.920 --> 49:55.840]  engorgement of the unproductive bit you cannot spend your way out of recession
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.640]  or borrow your way out of debt and when you repeat in that wooden and
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.840]  perfunctory way that our situation is better than others that were well placed
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.120]  to weather the storm I have to tell you you sound like a Brezhnev era aparachik
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.680]  giving the party line you know and we know and you know that we know that it's
[50:13.680 --> 50:18.280]  nonsense everyone knows that Britain is worse off than any other country as we
[50:18.280 --> 50:23.200]  go into these hard times the IMF has said so the European Commission has said
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.520]  so the markets have said so which is why our currency has devalued by 30% and
[50:28.520 --> 50:33.880]  soon the voters too will get their chance to say so they can see what the
[50:33.880 --> 50:37.840]  markets have already seen that you are the devalued prime minister of a

[1:01:29.440 --> 1:01:34.440]  front because it's a warm up there with rioting and things that are being staged
[1:01:34.440 --> 1:01:38.960]  clearly so we'll be breaking that down Obama's dictator status expands with
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:43.520]  firing of Wagner this is a prison planet dot com story from Paul Joseph
[1:01:43.520 --> 1:01:50.280]  Watson the staggering spectacle of a sitting president effectively firing the
[1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:54.520]  CEO of a private company heralds the beginning of a new phase and government
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:02:00.000]  takeover free enterprise according to the shocked economic observers economic
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.160]  observers staggered at government's mortal blow to free enterprise Obama's
[1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:10.200]  decision to send GM CEO Rick Wagner packing on Sunday afternoon stunned a
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:15.840]  previously buoyant stock market into a 250-point drop on Monday as traders
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:21.000]  struggled to digest the unprecedented move never before happened in US history
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.440]  this is just the latest example of expansion of Obama and his
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:28.640]  administration's power grab using the economic crisis created by the central
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:33.680]  bankers that pull their strings as an excuse to pose as the saviors while
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:37.640]  completely sinking any chances of a real recovery by not allowing
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:44.640]  incompetent banks and corporate systems to fail and by the way I listened to
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:50.240]  mainline AM and FM radio I scan listing about two three minutes driving to work
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:55.800]  and going back to home or doing errands to XM radio I never had a car with XM
[1:02:55.800 --> 1:03:03.080]  in it and recently I got a new car and has it and so I'm listening to it it's
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:09.440]  great to monitor but even mainline Fox News host radio host and others are
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:13.840]  saying this is staged it's new world order takeover I can't believe it it's
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:19.200]  like Alex Jones is is on these shows but they still had Al Qaeda's gonna get
[1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:23.000]  us give up all your rights you know war on terror and all that fake stuff and
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.840]  then I listened to the liberal shows and they're saying this and I'm even
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.200]  hearing they call it the left channel with little snipes that Obama they'll
[1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:35.480]  I've heard several show the shows go well you know Bush just did this and they
[1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:41.920]  go I mean Obama it's hard to tell the difference so what happens is is when
[1:03:41.920 --> 1:03:45.360]  all the talk show host start waking up most of them aren't government agents
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:50.160]  they were just picked because they believe in the false paradigm by the
[1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:55.480]  programmers as they start losing their pension funds as they start losing their
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:59.960]  401ks they start getting religion and figuring out and a lot of them admit
[1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:06.120]  listening to this show liberal and conservative and they're waking up so we
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:10.840]  have a good chance at arresting these bankers but we have to go all the way
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:16.080]  and so they can't censor or shut down all the shows and also the listeners are
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:20.480]  figuring it out so through peer pressure they're forcing the talk show host to
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:25.960]  talk about this so we have a good chance of turning this around I mean on many
[1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:31.080]  fronts this radio show could be rendered passé you know if these people
[1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:37.120]  continue to wake up and develop their understanding but I hear show after show
[1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:41.720]  after show on XM saying the bankers engineered this because they did it's on
[1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:46.720]  record they did it's as if Obama and the Congress wants to get worse they're
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:51.760]  getting all this power yes now you understand now you're getting the heart
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:58.240]  of the matter more on this anarchist plot mayhem for G20 in London and a lot

[1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:44.040]  mainstream news that's in my film terror storm and they've done this so the
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:47.520]  police don't get caught dressed up like anarchists like they've been caught in
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:53.760]  Denver last year Denver post police admit it or in Ottawa Canada last year at
[1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:57.520]  the SPP security prosperity partnership North American Union meeting or how they
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:00.360]  got caught in general Italy or how they got caught in Seattle and how they've
[1:10:00.360 --> 1:10:06.080]  been caught in England oh we're turning the cameras off today and for the next
[1:10:06.080 --> 1:10:12.040]  two days they're turning the cameras off so we're going to tell you why they
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:16.080]  claim that they're doing that former Cheney aides suggest that Hershey's
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:20.280]  account of executive assassination ring is certainly true this was on CNN with
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:24.960]  Will Blitzer of course there's a secret assassination team it's called the
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:32.160]  Delta Force and it isn't just Cheney it's from Jimmy Carter until Barack
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:37.880]  Obama all the presidents and so Hershey's making it political and just
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.200]  about Dick Cheney I'm just so sick of it the left will expose the right the
[1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:45.320]  right will expose the left and then meanwhile they're both wings on the
[1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:50.880]  same bird of prey ripping the eyeballs out of the American people Russia backs
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:55.120]  return to gold standard new global currency it's all coming up but I wanted
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:00.880]  to get as he joins us once a month Marty Schachter World War two veteran in the
[1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:07.240]  chemical Corps started a company in 1947 after the war with his daddy he runs it
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:12.120]  today with his son the original organic true soap company I like to have him on
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:15.640]  once a month because this is something that really will save people money but
[1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:19.240]  it's also an educational process when he's on the big chemical companies are
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:23.640]  all about making a new market taking over old markets and they came in they
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:29.480]  said we have all this extra byproduct petroleum refining that would be toxic
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:34.640]  waste we'll just put it in what we call soap it's really detergent and it's
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:39.520]  toxic it causes allergies and it causes asthma and it's all admitted the
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:42.840]  perfumes alone can be hundreds of different products and you pay a lot
[1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:47.080]  more money for it than actual organic real soap and I learned about this
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:52.960]  company about seven years ago when he first became a sponsor on Genesis
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:56.400]  because the sales manager was a conservative but also a real
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:01.040]  environmentalist and he found out that luxury hotels hospitals private
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.000]  hospitals were buying it that they didn't sell to the public and then
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.200]  Michael Trudeau called up Marty Schachter said you ought to sponsor here so
[1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:10.720]  that's what started their direct sales of the public and that's why it's 85%
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:17.160]  off stock market shopping grocery store prices 85% off if they've got the
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:21.080]  actuaries the numbers up about five star soap dot com because there isn't the
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:23.840]  middle man there's not the billions of dollars of advertising and proctor and
[1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:26.520]  gamble and the rest of them so I wanted to have him on just to encourage
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:31.200]  listeners the average person spends 25 30 bucks a week the average household on
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:35.720]  quote cleaning products you can get 85% off of that your bath soap your hair soap
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:40.120]  your dishwashing soap your laundry soap all of it and this is real with essential
[1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:45.640]  oils from fruits and vegetables no animals tallow no garbage none of it
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:49.360]  and it really is amazing stuff now there's the other side of that people
[1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:54.880]  on average paid double for organic stuff at stores what they pay for the
[1:12:54.880 --> 1:13:01.400]  detergent so this is 85% off detergent prices 85% off detergent prices and but
[1:13:01.400 --> 1:13:05.200]  then people that one organic are paying on average double for organic in the
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:11.800]  stores double the detergent when this is 85% off that so we do some
[1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:15.200]  calculations I've just seen myself that the organic stuff seems to be twice as
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:18.760]  much Marty should do a calculation on that and talk about it Marty great to
[1:13:18.760 --> 1:13:22.760]  have you back on with us good pleasure talking to you and your listeners Alex
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:28.280]  it's always a great joy once a month looking forward to this and I want to
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:34.200]  know whether all your listeners are ready for spring cleaning as we got the soap
[1:13:34.200 --> 1:13:41.160]  for them not the junk science we got the financial rescue program saves them
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:47.040]  lots of money gives them twice three times the cleaning ability with real
[1:13:47.040 --> 1:13:52.720]  old-fashioned soap by the way you know what I'm gonna do something my this IT
[1:13:52.720 --> 1:13:57.560]  guy our new IT guys never been on air with us Matt Matt come on in here he
[1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:00.440]  doesn't know I'm doing this he's in there across the room on a computer you
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:03.480]  want to know what I'm talking about we hired Matt we didn't tell people what
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:07.560]  company this was we don't want infiltrators a great IT guy used to
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:11.880]  work for the state and I'm going back from memory Matt didn't you when we
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:14.720]  first hired you say by the way I bought Calvin's soap and it lasted more than a
[1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:20.800]  year oh yeah about the 150 bars of soap and last and lasted me probably three
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:25.720]  and a half years and all I was definitely like to smell the soap it's kind
[1:14:25.720 --> 1:14:28.280]  like a fruit punch by the way I didn't tell you I was gonna pull you in here
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:32.960]  no I just saw you be well because I was about to say on air most of my office
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:35.680]  uses it you know they hear me and they know I don't make stuff up whatever I
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.480]  push I believe in and this all happened because Marty sent a year supply to my
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:44.560]  wife and the year and a half later the year supply was gone and she said where
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:48.320]  did you get that I want more and I called up Marty to buy more and he said
[1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:51.680]  I'll just send it to you and I said no how about you be I endorse you and boom

[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:08.040]  mean has a smell you can't it's incredible yes it's definitely the
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:12.240]  sound like it didn't smell like any kind of perfume it's real it's it just

[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:08.280]  war against humanity Barack Obama is the tip of the spear we've got to give them
[1:21:08.280 --> 1:21:12.600]  a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like
[1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:17.840]  to see the Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working
[1:21:17.840 --> 1:21:21.800]  for the best interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging

[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:44.000]  you're known for your limericks give us a limerick 19th century repeat there was
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:49.600]  an old man of man-tucket who kept all his cash in a bucket but his daughter
[1:24:49.600 --> 1:24:57.560]  named Nan ran away with a man and as far as the bucket man-tucket par followed
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:02.920]  the pair to poor tucket the man and the girl with a bucket and he said to the
[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:08.760]  man you're welcome to Nan but as for the bucket poor tucket then the pair
[1:25:08.760 --> 1:25:15.160]  followed par to man-hasset where he still held the cash as an asset and Nan and
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:22.600]  the man stole the money and ran and then this for the bucket man-hasset Marty
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:25.240]  you're something else you're one in a million take care my friend thank you
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:30.080]  guys talk to you soon bye-bye about five-star sub.com okay
[1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:35.440]  looking here at the news in front of me let's go ahead and get into Russia China
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:40.680]  the European Union all openly announcing a new global currency and then in a
[1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:43.640]  press conference and before Congress and two separate meetings you said well
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:47.720]  we're not really moving to that right now that's what Obama said that's what
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:51.280]  Jim Geithner said the guy that didn't pay his taxes and used to work for the
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:57.400]  World Bank and then on top of that he then spoke two days later last week to
[1:25:57.400 --> 1:26:02.760]  the Council on Foreign Relations that talk show host said didn't exist saying
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:07.560]  that oh yes we are moving towards that so that's definitely what's going on here
[1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:11.520]  and all we have left is the dollar we don't really manufacture that much we've
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:15.880]  been put into deep debt but we still have the fiat currency that goes the
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:19.960]  United States basically implodes into nothing said of the long slide into
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:23.840]  depression it could be an overnight situation so here is a clip with BBC
[1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:29.120]  talk host Max Kaiser routine guest on this show laying it out
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:33.800]  Max Kaiser let me come to you for the first part of this second part of the
[1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:37.440]  show I mean could a new powerful super currency be created and what would the
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:41.520]  pitfalls be in giving up the dollar as a reserve currency well the pitfalls are
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:45.520]  for the US the US has with the goal called an extraordinary privilege they
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:49.000]  can write checks that they never have to cash they just print new dollars this has
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:52.280]  been going on since Britain Woods in the end of World War two so the America is
[1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:56.240]  everything to lose and they're going to resist a new global currency every way
[1:26:56.240 --> 1:27:00.840]  that they possibly can China obviously would love to be able to do their
[1:27:00.840 --> 1:27:05.120]  business in currencies outside of the US dollar but look what happened in the
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:09.480]  Middle East look what happened to Saddam Hussein when he tried to start to trade
[1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:14.040]  oil in euros he was bombed and then assassinated by the US look what
[1:27:14.040 --> 1:27:17.640]  happened in Iran when they start talking about trading oil and gas in euros
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:22.240]  suddenly America is saber rattling in Iran so any country looks at those
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:25.080]  examples and they say you know if we get out of the US dollar does this mean
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:28.960]  American Marines are going to show up in our back door and start to cause mischief
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:32.040]  that's a that's a legitimate concern these countries have okay well I'm not
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:35.600]  so sure the American Marines will turn up on the streets of Beijing max but
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:40.200]  let's talk about this Chinese now that shows how much things have changed
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:46.200]  because that's on the BBC he talks like that every week on the article he's
[1:27:46.200 --> 1:27:48.840]  invited me to come on but I had to miss one of the interviews maybe we'll set
[1:27:48.840 --> 1:27:56.960]  that back up to the show and guess who linked to that video clip drudge this
[1:27:56.960 --> 1:28:02.040]  morning I mean that's all news of this audience but drudge is linking to stuff
[1:28:02.040 --> 1:28:07.440]  like that see this is becoming mainstream I told you I tuned into neocon
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:10.600]  fake conservative radio and they're talking about new world order the banks
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:15.760]  imploding things by design but they do say Obama's behind it no Obama is a
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:20.480]  front man just like George Bush was see if it was Bush still in power McCain
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:23.840]  the Republicans would be defending all of this but they do defend it with their
[1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:27.520]  votes they're all voting for it and I wouldn't be so sure I mean the IMF and
[1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:31.080]  World Bank are already issuing according to one telegraph and Wall Street
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:34.920]  Journal their own super currency it's just at the monetized inter banking
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:40.720]  central banking level it's not a physical currency and so that the CFR
[1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:44.920]  wants this they want the global government so the US has to fall for the
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:49.000]  rise of the European superstate controlling the world government the
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.880]  the the global Europe as last Tuesday Gordon Brown called it while speaking in
[1:28:53.880 --> 1:28:57.600]  the European Parliament we played that clip a world government with world
[1:28:57.600 --> 1:29:04.200]  regulatory power a world Europe openly being announced and again all of these
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:07.960]  neocon talk show host all these liberal talk show host in the control paradigm
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:14.240]  they've been denying this denying it and denying it and denying it and denying
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:17.320]  it because we could have fixed this a long time ago we could have stopped this
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:20.400]  now since the establishment thinks nothing can stop it because they're
[1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:23.480]  bringing us into world depression so they'll offer that as a solution because
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:27.440]  they think they got this cinched up the green light came on and all these talk
[1:29:27.440 --> 1:29:33.240]  show hosts are yet giving part of the truth so world governments real what are
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:37.280]  we gonna do about it now instead of protesting or actually giving negative
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:42.200]  coverage on the G20 the feds worldwide are staging riots so they can demonize

[1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:34.760]  go to our reporters info wars dot com reporters and they're both on the same
[1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:39.800]  cell phone out in the field they are still they've been in Los Angeles and
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:43.560]  San Diego they're now on the last few days been up at the tent cities little
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:48.280]  archipelago that stretches for miles the media's downplayed that we've confirmed
[1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:52.760]  that they say 125 tents it's close to 400 that they've been able to count and they
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:58.200]  had to hike in to do that count and they they've been another hike I've been
[1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:02.160]  told so they're here to give us a report but the issue here is Schwarzenegger
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:06.400]  announced the governor of Hawaii announced and others are announcing that
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:09.000]  you're not allowed to be homeless they're gonna force you into sports stadiums
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.960]  into fairgrounds and they make you in California go to the fairgrounds the
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:19.360]  different facilities at well at 5 a.m. they wake you up they bust you out
[1:34:19.360 --> 1:34:24.160]  wrap you off if you back at 3 o'clock to be brought back in not allowed to take
[1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:28.880]  really any of your belongings it's overcrowded cots and you wear bracelets
[1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:34.400]  they want to scan you it's basically a prison and this that's a very very
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:37.480]  dangerous precedent as the depression intensifies and more people become
[1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:41.720]  homeless and regular folks the working poor want to go out and live in tents a
[1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.680]  few months on average is the story to raise enough money to get a down payment
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:49.840]  on a house to rent or apartment because they got a lot of money be able to do
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:53.920]  that the paid two or three months you know down as their deposit the pet
[1:34:53.920 --> 1:34:57.440]  deposit the rest of it and I see these horrible quotes I see one in the LA
[1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:00.960]  Times of a woman who had the CPS take her six-year-old because she was
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:04.640]  homeless and now they're gonna make her move out of the tent and take her dog
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:08.400]  I don't know if my guys in the field have seen that article but the headline
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:12.400]  it's up on info wars.com we have a link to it deals with how they're being the
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:17.000]  police just showed up and made them all put bracelets on without a court order
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.840]  without anything out there not in the FEMA camp but in the open-air tent
[1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:29.960]  cities so for a quick report let's go to Jason Douglas and Rob do there in

[1:35:48.040 --> 1:35:54.000]  really seen this big a community just all gathering together and it's stretches
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.320]  out over such a wide area that you know any one little encampment it looks pretty
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:08.200]  big and unto itself but they're just dotted all over the landscape and you
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:12.320]  know it's mostly just people trying to survive people that either because of
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:16.280]  the laws that are happening you know we just talked to a guy that got his got
[1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:20.720]  pulled over and because he didn't have insurance on his new Winnebago they
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:24.520]  just took it they took all of his belongings everything he owned and left
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:29.480]  him out on the side of the street and somebody pointed out Tent City and said
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:33.440]  you know we're camping out over there and so that's how he made his way over
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:41.960]  here how much will it be to unimpound his vehicle he was saying it was about a
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:47.920]  thousand dollars okay I know you guys are supposed to leave today and you're
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:51.160]  end up not having time to do this but it's not just important for the film to
[1:36:51.160 --> 1:36:58.120]  show this are they going to make him show up with insurance on top of it to
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.960]  be able to get it out yeah it he'll have to be with insurance and in order for
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:06.360]  them to get it out because that is there is there I look I know your wives and
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:09.800]  children think you're coming back tonight can you change the ticket and
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:14.640]  stay another day and I'll wire you money and then you can get that whole
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:18.760]  process on tape to show this crime this is key for the film plus I want to help
[1:37:18.760 --> 1:37:22.840]  this guy I will pay the thousand dollars to get the Winnebago out I will pay to
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:26.960]  get him a month of insurance you know let me talk it over with him because I'm
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:31.080]  not even sure he made it sound as though they have already auctioned off his stuff
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:37.960]  oh my god is Winnebago yeah basically this stuff and then they sell off so I
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:41.720]  will talk to him and find out what's up with that if he even knows anything
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:45.960]  because the way he was talking you know he just he just gave up on all his
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:49.560]  stuff well that's how people become homeless you know Limbaugh and others
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:53.040]  create this illusion that it's only crackheads heroin heads and drugs and
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:57.360]  mentally ill people and that certainly is the classic lion's share base of
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:01.560]  homelessness but no there's more and more people who lose their jobs so they
[1:38:01.560 --> 1:38:05.320]  have a Winnebago and then they take it and I see reports every few months about
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:10.120]  you know hippies that are homeschooling kids living in a Winnebago and CPS takes
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:17.240]  their children and I'm reading that in the news and oh man you know you know
[1:38:17.240 --> 1:38:20.960]  you should have a lot of information about kids being taken away and
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:27.760]  being taken away oh that's the MO yeah oh god and they want them all over the
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:31.080]  country for some of the camps so they have them all in one spot to take their
[1:38:31.080 --> 1:38:35.600]  children there's a lady in the LA Times like let me go to info wars.com I
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:38.360]  should have I thought I printed this this morning and I noticed it's not in my
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:44.480]  stack but it's up on the site and it's an article about they make them where
[1:38:44.480 --> 1:38:47.120]  those those those wristbands not when they're in the camp but they show up and
[1:38:47.120 --> 1:38:51.400]  make them just under fiat orders color of law to put these on so they can write
[1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:56.880]  like yellow stars for Jews in Germany literally right there brand animal well
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:38:59.120]  you know before you went I said they're gonna be grabbing their kids they're
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:02.880]  gonna be seizing their cars and it's not that I'm always gloom and dooming I
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:06.200]  know how government operates what has this been like for you to see this
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:12.120]  Jason it's just been amazing to just watch all of the different kinds of
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:14.880]  stories because people have you know they have a lot in common but there's
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:18.880]  really all different kinds of people out here you know we the guy that owns the
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:25.160]  Winnebago he was a marketing director and so he works with computers he does
[1:39:25.160 --> 1:39:29.480]  marketing he's a salesman really smooth guy you know he gets up every day he
[1:39:29.480 --> 1:39:33.760]  take he goes to the place where you can take a shower he stays clean his
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:40.000]  fingernails are clean and you know he just stuck out here so he was trying to
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.920]  get another job live in the Winnebago yeah that's actually I don't have the
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:47.320]  money myself to buy a decent one that that's kind of our emergency plan
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:53.200]  because I don't haven't anything really everything collapses and I guess if I'm
[1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:56.520]  caught at a checkpoint without my proper papers like outside Fallujah I mean this
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:39:59.920]  is the model I I'm gone and then they'll say well you're homeless we're taking
[1:39:59.920 --> 1:40:05.920]  your kids I mean this is America folks this is America yeah it's America and
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:11.600]  and look at what's happening my god amazing part of these for LA was that
[1:40:11.600 --> 1:40:15.680]  I went to places because I'm from Los Angeles so I know all the places where
[1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:21.760]  the homeless are and we went there and it was they're gone we tried to find out
[1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:26.720]  where they're taking them but they're just gone I don't know if they stuck them
[1:40:26.720 --> 1:40:31.440]  in a camp or they rounded them all up you know what's going on down there but
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:34.580]  well that's what you confirmed at multiple sites that they came and cleared
[1:40:34.580 --> 1:40:39.840]  them out that's what you said yesterday so specifically they obviously gave him
[1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:44.920]  a slip for his highway robbery for the the highwayman that stole his his home
[1:40:44.920 --> 1:40:50.000]  you know those cops had no soul they should have just said buddy get
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.720]  insurance get this off the road and here's the next point I've had sheriffs
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:56.920]  and police chief on this but all over the news illegal aliens when they're
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:01.520]  caught 1015 to a van or Winnebago the judges just released them so police
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:05.520]  don't arrest them I had an employee with an expired driver's license one day I
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:10.200]  pull up to the office there's two police cars and cherries I pull up I know to
[1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:14.600]  approach him from a distance I walk up the police kind of charge up to me what
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:17.720]  do you want they said oh it's Alex Jones they said hey Alex like your show
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:26.320]  blah blah blah but I mean to make a long story short I said you wouldn't be
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:29.560]  arresting him right now if he was in legal alien they said no the judges just
[1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:34.240]  let him go we're told not to so again an American citizen gets no leeway
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:38.480]  instead of just saying you better pull that off if I see this again I'll give
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:42.680]  you a ticket so instead of giving him a ticket for not having the insurance they
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:47.600]  stole his Winnebago stole his Winnebago and just left him out on the side of the
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:54.040]  road with nothing yeah my god they're in any one of us you know you hard core
[1:41:54.040 --> 1:41:59.960]  criminals month and then your cars gone and to them it's we're just doing our
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:04.160]  job we're just doing our job right right that's exactly what they said go one
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:08.160]  one police officer was telling him you know oh I didn't want it I didn't want
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:14.680]  to do this but um we're just not going to be able to let you go and I guarantee
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:18.440]  if you stayed in that town for a week you could set off off highways and when
[1:42:18.440 --> 1:42:22.280]  they do pull an illegal alien over you can watch them let him go with no
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:25.400]  insurance no I said you could follow that person to a McDonald's or wherever
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:30.600]  they're going and you could walk up and ask him what what they pull you over for
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:35.080]  and they tell you no insurance that's just the hell of it the hell of it and
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.000]  I'm not for grabbing the illegal aliens and putting them in camps if they don't
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.520]  have something you know they're on the edge of survival the point is don't do
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:44.640]  it to citizens you know I'm sorry to have you on here and I'm ranting at you
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:47.520]  it's just that I wish you weren't confirming everything I already knew
[1:42:47.520 --> 1:42:52.160]  you were gonna find what about the snatching of children we we've talked
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:55.760]  to a couple different people either their children got snatched before they
[1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.800]  went out here you know maybe they were in an apartment there's a lot of people
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:04.680]  where it's like they're turning families against each other where where the
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:09.240]  social services come in they speak to the grandparents and they get them to
[1:43:09.240 --> 1:43:13.400]  turn state's evidence or you know say something against their kids and then
[1:43:13.400 --> 1:43:18.560]  their kids end up losing their kids well it's worse than that a lot of times in
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:21.280]  the grandparents don't even go but you know they think the CPS is their friend
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:24.240]  you know that's what happens that's what happens they think they're gonna get the
[1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:27.320]  kids but then it they just end up going to a third party or into an
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:31.680]  institution well that's because they get 10 times 20 times the money for every
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:34.560]  child they have than actually with the family others this government's totally
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:42.600]  criminal yeah here it is it says Ontario California tent city residents
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:48.080]  required to wear wristbands and this is Los Angeles and it says dozens of a
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:52.240]  lot of belly yeah it doesn't see maybe you've had time to go to that dozens of
[1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:55.360]  Ontario police and code enforcement officers descended upon a homeless
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:44:01.240]  encampment known as tent city early Monday separating those who could stay
[1:44:01.240 --> 1:44:08.680]  from those to be evicted large often confused crowds formed ragged lines
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:14.040]  behind police barricades where officers handed out color-coded wristbands blue
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:20.880]  mint they were from Ontario and could remain orange indicated they had to
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:28.040]  provide more proof to avoid ejection and white mint they had a week to leave and
[1:44:28.040 --> 1:44:33.240]  then you go down here and it says they took the ladies child you know sounds
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:40.160]  nice huh yeah just great that's America right now for you it says a patty barns
[1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:44.120]  47 who had her motor home towed away last week shook with anger so the same
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:50.080]  story they are tagging us because we are homeless she said staring at her orange
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:56.720]  wristband it feels like a concentration camp and then there's a another one here
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:44:59.800]  I've actually got a click on the story we just posted a few paragraphs of it I
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:03.560]  got she had to go to the LA Times and in here it talks about a snatch this lady
[1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:08.200]  six-year-old and now they want her dog she said they already took my child not
[1:45:08.200 --> 1:45:14.120]  my dog and she breaks down crying yeah this is they're the dogs and the
[1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:17.920]  children it's the last thing that these people have I mean they've been stripped
[1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:21.480]  of everything you hear these stories you know it's just slowly they went down
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:27.480]  hill and then the government comes in and takes the last bit of humanity that
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.920]  they have and then they have no self-esteem you know these people you
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:35.320]  can see it in their eyes they're trying to figure out how to get a job they're
[1:45:35.320 --> 1:45:39.000]  trying to figure out how to get out of here and you know when your self-esteem
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.480]  is that low and you've just been beaten down it it starts to feel like the
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:48.640]  country is against you well it's listen to this the no pet order caused widespread
[1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:52.480]  anger and tears Monday is some homeless people said they could not imagine life
[1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:57.040]  without their dogs many have three or four and vowed to leave tent city before
[1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:00.360]  giving up the dogs I will go to jail before they take my dog said an
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:08.240]  emotional Diane Richie 47 that's part of me as much as anything the dogs are as
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:14.640]  homeless as we are Cindy Duke 40 hugged the woman who was sobbing I had to give
[1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:17.920]  up my six-year-old son because I was homeless and I'll be damned if I give
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:23.560]  up my dog too it says we thought if we came here we could save enough money but
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:28.880]  now they have pulled the rug out from under us said Triton who was a from
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:34.560]  another town and he was fibromyalgia painful disorder so so what understand
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:39.160]  folks they're saying it's concentration camp see and they're just that they
[1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:43.480]  can't wait to attack dog the US citizens and steal their cars steal their
[1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:48.400]  Winnebago's shut them down and again most of them these have been going on for
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:54.960]  years they they save money for a few months and then they move on anything
[1:46:54.960 --> 1:47:00.360]  else Rob do you can tell us you know it's just it's just crazy down here you
[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:03.400]  kind of it's one of those things where we're trying to get the footage that we
[1:47:03.400 --> 1:47:09.840]  can but seeing that's just with your naked eye it's it's crazy it's crazy
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:13.960]  what's going on and hearing the stories and the testimonials I'm just you know
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:19.240]  regular people trying to make it and it just seems like every which way they go
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:22.920]  there's it's dead end well I'm gonna put a call out I don't have the personnel
[1:47:22.920 --> 1:47:26.680]  Aaron's having to produce right now what you guys are gone I don't have the
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:31.120]  money to go to all of these I'm asking listeners in California to go to this
[1:47:31.120 --> 1:47:34.880]  Ontario, California one interview these people who where they took their kids
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:39.440]  took their Winnebago there to mail it to us we'll put it in the new Obama film I
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:44.200]  don't have the money and the time to cover all of this go to your tent cities
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:46.360]  all over the country where they're grabbing their children grabbing their
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:54.520]  cars grabbing their Winnebago's this crime has to be told and we just don't
[1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.520]  even have the personnel of the funds here you know and people even bet you
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:01.880]  about the few sponsors we've got to be able to pay for what we're doing it's
[1:48:01.880 --> 1:48:05.200]  just tearing my guts out and and and now they're just gonna grab all their
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:10.040]  cars and children this is so hellish and so I'm asking listeners go get it
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:14.000]  email us let us know the footage is coming you know we can do all this
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  together but I don't want to just show one guy who has Winnebago taken I want
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.800]  to show this other lady and the other lady where they're taking their kids
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:24.760]  have people that have had their children taken been willing to talk about it
[1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:30.480]  we've gotten some stuff on on tape of you know the discussions of people who
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:36.400]  have lost their kids but yeah they're talking about it my god you understand
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:39.960]  Jason Jason do you understand that the illegal aliens aren't treated like this
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:46.560]  oh yeah yeah there's a lot of sentiment about illegal aliens here and just how
[1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:50.280]  it you know it's completely different treatment you know there's no jobs
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:55.960]  because there's such an influx of illegal and then on top of that they get
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:48:59.400]  preferential treatment because you know supposedly there's nothing that we can
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:03.360]  do to them because they you know along somewhere else those police that have
[1:49:03.360 --> 1:49:08.040]  done this are have committed vicious crimes yeah and I don't even hate the

[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:31.360]  shelter and you know so we found out where it was that we haven't been inside
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:35.520]  they they asked us not to come inside when when there's people there so we
[1:55:35.520 --> 1:55:39.200]  might might try to go back and get it get over there before before they bring
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.320]  in the night the night crew I guess they bring in about 150 people 152 people
[1:55:44.320 --> 1:55:49.480]  every day they have an always filled so and it cost them around a million
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:55:54.440]  dollars to have 50 beds so yeah of course government steals everything you
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:59.960]  could have those people for a couple hundred thousand sure you know the
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:03.120]  people out here they seem to like the camping they seem to like what's going
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:06.240]  you know that you know and everybody's got problems there's reasons that
[1:56:06.240 --> 1:56:10.000]  everybody's out here and you know it's everybody you know they're no different
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.600]  they're no different than you know any other person you meet on the street you
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:17.120]  know because you haven't happened you don't have issues right exactly you
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:20.040]  got that just because you have a house doesn't mean you don't have issues you
[1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:24.720]  know yeah we're not looking down on them now um be sure and get as many of their
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:27.920]  phone numbers and names as you can so we can have them on the show next week
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:31.320]  maybe do two hours the whole bunch of the people out there specifically the
[1:56:31.320 --> 1:56:36.880]  fellow that had is one of those stolen and others okay yeah and actually there
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:41.360]  was just the where where one the largest collection attempt is that there's a
[1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:45.200]  there's power lines around above and those are owned by that that land is owned
[1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:50.080]  by smud which is that Sacramento Municipal Utility Division or something
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.160]  like that and so what they're saying now is they're gonna fence off the large
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:58.240]  area that they're at so they can't stay here and and what basically what they're
[1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:02.200]  gonna do they're either gonna move to one side of the train tracks or down down
[1:57:02.200 --> 1:57:06.040]  the levee a little bit more and so now the government's gonna pay to put up
[1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:11.960]  fences everywhere right leaving them alone
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:16.440]  try to get over here yeah exactly so there they're uh yeah they're gonna
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:20.360]  spend a bunch of money to fence off this area when they could probably just you
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:25.120]  know spend that money on porta-potties and you know porta-potties out here man I
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:30.560]  know they took those seven days right somebody apparently did something to
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:34.280]  one of them as far as playing in some way okay ruined one of them but
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:37.280]  Stoner wasn't too happy but he was cool so they took him out after five days
[1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.520]  right so somebody just like they had a fire last night for that attempt yeah
[1:57:40.520 --> 1:57:44.280]  park at our department about not good right yeah brings attention with the
[1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:47.920]  porta-potties one person for everybody not good right all the things that
[1:57:47.920 --> 1:57:53.360]  they're doing good for us one person blows it for everybody but the big
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:57.760]  issue is I need to not kidnap the children and steal people's cars Rob do
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:02.480]  I guess I'll have you back in studio tomorrow then to give us a report and
[1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:07.320]  so maybe we should go ahead and have some of these people on tomorrow but I'm
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:10.600]  putting a call out to our listeners to go to the other camps the one identified
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:15.400]  where they make them wear wristbands in one of these forest camps down outside
[1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:20.960]  LA and that's again in the LA Times story up on info wars.com but a great
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:25.040]  job out there be sure it's get lots of interviews with the guy who they stole

[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:44.760]  minutes we're joined by Steve Watson of prisonplanet.com works for us over in
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:50.640]  London anarchist plot mayhem for the G20 in London curtain Emma London
[2:00:50.640 --> 2:00:53.520]  independent reports extremists and anarchist groups are handing out
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:57.480]  literature ahead of the London's G20 summit instructing demonstrators on how
[2:00:57.480 --> 2:01:01.240]  best to confront and attack the police now from Denver Colorado last year at the
[2:01:01.240 --> 2:01:07.240]  DNC to Ottawa Canada at the SPP meeting early last year they've been caught the
[2:01:07.240 --> 2:01:10.880]  police dressed up like anarchist leading groups of hired foundation thugs
[2:01:10.880 --> 2:01:15.640]  paid for by the big banks to attack police to then show that on the news so
[2:01:15.640 --> 2:01:19.480]  the police have a pretext to say oh look we're being restrained for a day or so
[2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:23.560]  then to attack the peaceful crowds this is the way they demonize the
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:27.400]  demonstrators and that covers up all the news attention of what the G20 is
[2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:31.040]  actually setting up Obama's about to arrive in England he's gonna have an
[2:01:31.040 --> 2:01:35.720]  audience with the Queen and literally curtsy to her that's in the London
[2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:39.720]  Telegraph we've got him then traveling to Europe proper for the G20 meeting that
[2:01:39.720 --> 2:01:43.240]  Gordon Brown founded and runs openly setting up world government and then
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:46.880]  we have the London Guardian reporting the government's gonna turn off the CCT
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:50.360]  cameras claiming there's a law that they're not high enough resolution so
[2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:55.320]  they're just gonna turn them all off so they can carry out their mischief just
[2:01:55.320 --> 2:01:58.640]  like they turned them off right before they carried out the 7-7 bombing Steve
[2:01:58.640 --> 2:02:04.360]  Watson joining us from London tell us what's going on Alex I did good sir
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:10.160]  yeah okay I think the first thing we should discuss really is concerning the
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:17.800]  media hype surrounding the the supposed foiled terrorist plot in relation to
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:26.720]  the protests the Guardian reported that yesterday three men and two women aged
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:34.880]  between 16 and 25 living in the south of England were arrested they raided the
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:43.680]  house and they brought in the Royal Navy bomb disposal squad and it's it was
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:49.240]  hyped up in the media sort of terrorist plot relating to the G20 protests it
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:57.560]  comes out today that what they found was quote allegedly extremist materials
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:03.600]  but they didn't expand on what they might be yesterday they said they found
[2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:10.440]  explosive devices it turns out now that these are fireworks let me stop you
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:16.600]  mainstream government reports in the news say that a cell phone is terrorist
[2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:22.320]  material that a van is terrorist material and to and that soap bottles in
[2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:26.120]  the trash can call the anti-terror police so this is all part of the hype
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:32.040]  my god they had fireworks they are al-Qaeda well that's right we recently
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:38.680]  seen all those anti-terrorist posters that have gone up all over London saying

[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:04.120]  Steve Watson Steve Watson so they've got as usual they always have some fake
[2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:09.800]  terror plot you know like they said in Miami a group of black Muslims are
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:13.640]  planning to wage war destroy every capital an army of death with incredible
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:17.000]  weapons and two days later they were homeless kids the FBI gave a hundred
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:20.880]  thousand dollars they were black Christians they told them the homeless
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:25.320]  kids to go videotape teenagers some of them is 14 that they give them a hundred
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:29.480]  grand if they would videotape the FBI building and they said okay I went
[2:09:29.480 --> 2:09:33.280]  videotape didn't then hype the news it's the same story over and over again but
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:36.720]  the news when it's the big headline terrorists they just plot of you know
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:41.120]  foiled an attack with dirty bombs my gosh and turns out fireworks at their
[2:09:41.120 --> 2:09:45.560]  house in a toy cap gun and I've seen this to patriot groups they'll raid some
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:49.080]  militia guy they'll walk out on the news and go look pipe bombs and hold up
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:54.840]  jumper cables I mean they don't care I mean this government is completely
[2:09:54.840 --> 2:10:01.400]  criminal it's illegitimate Steve Watson we've got all these headlines but I'm
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:05.480]  turning off the CCTV cameras so people can't see the cops dressed up like
[2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:08.760]  anarchist attacking people the foundation funded anarchists always
[2:10:08.760 --> 2:10:11.360]  into threatening email saying we're lying about this when it's all over the
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:14.880]  news they work for the cops that have been caught everywhere man I made a film
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:21.760]  10 years ago about it we've got all of this going on we've got articles here
[2:10:21.760 --> 2:10:26.600]  dealing with the anarchist plot mayhem for the g20 and London Kurt Nemo doing a
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:30.760]  story on this how it's all just made up how the foundations openly fund them
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:38.640]  continue okay so we've got this group of kids with fake guns and firework
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:44.400]  this has been hyped up and now as a result of this and the week-long you
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:49.640]  know campaign seemingly by the police to ensure everyone that it's going to turn
[2:10:49.640 --> 2:10:53.600]  violent because that's what they've been saying we've got Gordon Brown coming out
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:57.320]  today saying that it's going to be violent but we're going to deal with it
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:05.160]  swiftly we've got 500 sorry 5,000 extra police on the streets under
[2:11:05.160 --> 2:11:11.760]  something called Operation Glencoe they've armed them all with tasers we've
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:17.640]  got banks boarded up shop boarded up bankers being told not to dress like
[2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:22.920]  bankers because they'll be attacked and strung up and skin dive and all this
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:27.200]  kind of thing and then meanwhile the big foundation runs Soviet groups the
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:30.440]  communist groups having their own conference they're allowed to openly
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:34.080]  call for violence and put out websites and pamphlets and nothing's done to them
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:39.080]  because they're stinking operatives go ahead well that's right we've got a
[2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:47.280]  load of stories out today about the the anarchist you know they openly telling
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:51.280]  the press what they're gonna do we've got they've been handing out flyers and
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:57.160]  maps and everything of where they're gonna go they say they're gonna pretend
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:01.560]  to be legitimate protesters and then they're gonna break off from the group
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:08.000]  storm the city which is a financial district of London and quote hold it
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:13.920]  down for as long as they possibly can so let's understand what's happening we
[2:12:13.920 --> 2:12:18.440]  need to do a blurb of the hundreds of admissions mainstream you know Canadian
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:23.840]  past US press French press Dutch press where they hire these thugs I've got
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:27.280]  training videos and where they're taken by the foundations and trained in Oregon
[2:12:27.280 --> 2:12:31.080]  three months before they then fly them into Seattle in 99s when I learned about
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:35.120]  all of this now the police on tape admitting it the Delta Force leading
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:38.600]  them Seattle Post intelligences we need to have an article that's the history of
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:43.920]  this all the confirmed confirmations of who they work for we need people down
[2:12:43.920 --> 2:12:48.600]  there with video cameras to show how the police in plain clothes are gonna be
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:52.520]  leading these punks because we're really breaking through now with the people
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:57.560]  Steve Watson they're finding out this is provocateur yeah I mean the left the
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:04.120]  last major protest we had in London on this scale were when Bush came over last
[2:13:04.120 --> 2:13:10.760]  summer and what is farewell tour and people came out there and and there was
[2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:15.200]  a lot of there were stories then about provocaturing that the MP the anti-war
[2:13:15.200 --> 2:13:22.560]  MP George Galloway officially accused police officer of provocaturing and
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:27.960]  no no no exactly no it was in mainstream British papers and on YouTube
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:34.000]  because folks shot video of and it came out to some gay guy recognized the gay
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.680]  police officer his lover dressed up that was one of the stories you can pull it
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:42.760]  I forget the head was like London Times or something he recognized him dressed
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:47.080]  up like an anarchist hitting cops and yelling and calling for fights and then
[2:13:47.080 --> 2:13:52.320]  his gay lover went on the news and said that's my lover I recognize him and then
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:58.920]  it all came out so you know there's a whole history of it you can go to
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:05.600]  Seattle the World Trade Organization protest in 99 which was in your film
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:13.440]  police state too you know it's all covered in there as the SPP protest two
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:19.000]  years three years ago two years ago in Montobello in Canada where we've been
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:23.160]  over that where the hired provocateurs were out there there's there to admit
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:28.200]  that they were they were police well mounted royal mounted police go ahead
[2:14:28.200 --> 2:14:38.320]  yeah you know Genoa WTO protest in Genoa in 2001 you got protestors being shot
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:46.560]  and run over and the Italian police then taking over school and putting people in
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:51.720]  there and then later admitting that you know they were claiming to be you know
[2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:56.440]  protested anarchists well they just caught them hold on they just caught
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:59.800]  them in Greece a few months ago the police directing guys with sledge
[2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:03.560]  hammers and baseball bats beating up cars and they were cops that's on
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:10.720]  national news in Greece that the cops are doing it was the free trade area of
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:20.160]  America's protest in 2003 or 2004 there was a fortune 599 in Austin with Austin
[2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.920]  cops I caught doing it yeah so I mean it's there's a long history of it so you
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:31.440]  know we've got we've got the police you know being got bomb squads being
[2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:35.360]  detached to houses with kids with fireworks in while these anarchists
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:40.720]  are all sort of making their plans known in public and another thing that's
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:45.960]  another thing that's come out of this is demonization of the internet because in
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:51.480]  the media they've been you know harping on about how all these dangerous sort of
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:15:56.880]  protesters that want violence have been have been using Twitter and using
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:16:01.400]  Facebook and that's how they're gonna you know evade the police that's right
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:05.760]  the terrorists the terrorist extremists are using the internet it must be
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:10.920]  restricted immediately exactly and this comes at the same time we've got all
[2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:15.120]  these debates going on about the government wanting to monitor social
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:19.720]  networks like Facebook and Twitter and we have the head of anti-terrorism
[2:16:19.720 --> 2:16:23.120]  cybersecurity resign saying the Pentagon's running the whole thing
[2:16:23.120 --> 2:16:29.920]  illegally yeah we've got I mean they've already already virtually got the right
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:34.760]  to monitor emails and phone calls of everybody in this country if it seemed
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.160]  to be a security threat and now they want to do the same for these social
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:44.880]  networks so if anything kicks off the next few days that's already been hyped
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:49.600]  to a point where it's gonna provide them a perfect pretext to Steve can I get you
[2:16:49.600 --> 2:16:52.640]  with your cell phone to go down and do some reporting for us perhaps Thursday
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:17:01.600]  and Friday well I can yeah I mean it's gonna be I think they think it's gonna
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:07.640]  be intense down there now I want to go to Steve from Steve to Paul Watson his
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:11.640]  brother also works with us but specifically what do you think the
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:14.720]  London Telegraph and other articles about how all last week Obama is
[2:17:14.720 --> 2:17:22.560]  practicing gifts and etiquette how to be reviewed by the Queen and to bow to her what
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:29.280]  do I think about that yes well I haven't seen any of that but they work
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:34.400]  within the Telegraph the Telegraph yeah that's the kind of thing that they
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:42.200]  print of course you know we saw when Bush came to meet the Queen who is of
[2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:49.040]  course distantly related to it's all the same bloodline we saw the the open
[2:17:49.040 --> 2:17:54.080]  sort of pomp and ceremony there I'm sure it'll be along the same lines as that
[2:17:54.080 --> 2:17:58.760]  yeah here's the article Barack Obama's team preparing adequate and gifts for
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:03.520]  president's meeting with the Queen top advisors to Obama are rehearsing the

[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:27.800]  the GCN radio network
[2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:31.000]  Jason Burmese just ran up to me during the break and he's like I've got it on
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:35.680]  video Dick Morris and Sean Hannity last night admitted the new world order
[2:24:35.680 --> 2:24:38.560]  conspiracy in the world currency and that all the conspiracy nuts are right
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:43.120]  see I'm hearing that everywhere from liberal and conservative talk show hosts
[2:24:43.120 --> 2:24:47.000]  it's amazing going to Paul Watson who runs prisonplanet.com for us reporting
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:52.920]  on the G20 starting with Queen worship today and tomorrow and leading into the
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:57.960]  European summit openly setting up world government Paul Watson hello Alex good
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:01.560]  to be back good to have you here okay we got your brothers take from London on
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:07.720]  what's happening give us your analysis well what springs to mind when I read
[2:25:07.720 --> 2:25:13.440]  about all these black block anarchist groups threatening riots and threatening
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:19.320]  to attack police and buildings and stuff is and this is targeted specifically
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:22.880]  at the black block anarchists which we know are provocative not the
[2:25:22.880 --> 2:25:28.800]  legitimate protesters of which I'm sure there'll be many but you know the
[2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:33.240]  question is why are they why are they so angry about the economic crisis most
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:38.520]  of the black block anarchists the communists and Marxists and we read that
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:44.000]  they're supposedly protesting against quote capitalism well if that's the case
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:49.520]  you know they should be happy about how the elite have responded to the economic
[2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:54.640]  crisis because everything they've done in response to it as eviscerated any
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:26:00.640]  notion of free market capitalism you know you've got Obama effectively firing
[2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:06.760]  a CEO of a private company on Sunday afternoon how does that represent the
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:12.920]  interest of capitalism and these people are supposedly protesting against
[2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:18.600]  Gordon Brown as if he as if Gordon Brown represents free market capitalism
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:23.280]  when he comes from a school of political thinking born out of the Labour
[2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:29.040]  Party which is completely entrenched in Marxism and Stalinism which is what a
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:34.320]  lot of what these black block protesters would themselves embrace that's why it
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:39.640]  doesn't fit right with me that these individuals are supposedly representative
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:46.040]  of the anger that there isn't out of the economic crisis because you have to ask
[2:26:46.040 --> 2:26:51.320]  yourself how many of the black block anarchists and again I'm talking about
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:55.400]  these black block not the legitimate protesters how many of them have actually
[2:26:55.400 --> 2:27:00.440]  been affected by the economic crisis you know do the majority of them have
[2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:06.160]  jobs and pay taxes the answer is no do the majority of them own property that's
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:12.800]  losing its value every day no do the majority of them have savings accounts
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:18.160]  that are losing value every day as a result of the globalist openly financed
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:21.240]  these groups we've caught them over and over again they're disgusting a lot of
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:24.920]  people you've got some stupid camp followers of the anarchist who aren't
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:27.760]  government agents but their their government foundation operatives at the
[2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:31.000]  top we've caught them over and over again it's a fact and they don't like
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.800]  hearing it and they trot them out to demonize real protests of the police can
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:38.960]  attack protest to then create a chilling effect where normal people don't come out
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:44.840]  and mass to demonstrate right and it's it's all about getting the middle class
[2:27:44.840 --> 2:27:51.200]  to support the police state because that in Britain the middle class who
[2:27:51.200 --> 2:27:56.200]  ironically are the prime target of the economic assault though you know they're
[2:27:56.200 --> 2:28:00.160]  equally as brain dead as the black block anarchist they don't realize it they're
[2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:05.800]  the target of the economic assault and yet a majority of them I would estimate
[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:10.960]  in this country will cheer the police on as they crack the head of these
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:16.480]  anarchists this week because they have this taste for these anarchists because
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:22.800]  of the things they do they have no real solutions it's like in your film
[2:28:22.800 --> 2:28:29.480]  martial law you went and interviewed the anarchists and the communists that the
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:33.560]  different protests there in New York and you tried to engage in a conversation
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:40.160]  with them about what they were actually protested against and in 99% of the
[2:28:40.160 --> 2:28:44.400]  people you speak to the most they're able to give you is you know a two
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:49.160]  cents and cliche about the evils of capitalism and the bourgeoisie middle
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:54.320]  class so it's the middle class that will cheer the police on when they crack
[2:28:54.320 --> 2:28:59.680]  their head that some it's like the G20 this week so that's the horrible irony of
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:05.080]  it all no it's all stage theater to fool the general public into going along
[2:29:05.080 --> 2:29:08.240]  with the police state I forgot to ask your brother what about turning off the
[2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:11.880]  CCTV cameras the government just as though we're turning them off for this
[2:29:11.880 --> 2:29:19.200]  hmm it certainly raised suspicions with me I mean there are people that say
[2:29:19.200 --> 2:29:24.400]  well you know it's only about 60 cameras if you count them all everybody at
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:27.840]  the marches are gonna have their own cameras and stuff so if they're really
[2:29:27.840 --> 2:29:31.440]  trying to hide them they're not gonna do a very good job of it but yeah it's
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:37.840]  definitely interesting all right anything else important to add Paul yeah
[2:29:37.840 --> 2:29:41.040]  I've got a bit more to add stay there they're gonna take calls ever you leave

[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:56.560]  crying person moan understand your man I'm part of your bad mouth and understand
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:34:02.680]  your man all right let's go back to Paul Watson the near phone calls okay Paul
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.080]  the other key points you've been analyzing over it prisonplanted.com
[2:34:06.080 --> 2:34:12.240]  and prisonplanted.tv yeah we were talking about the black block anarchist and
[2:34:12.240 --> 2:34:18.000]  interesting if you read what people throughout history who have actually
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:25.240]  changed history through nonviolent civil disobedience have said about rioting
[2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:32.920]  I found a quote from Martin Luther King who said quote the limitation of riot
[2:34:32.920 --> 2:34:38.320]  moral questions aside is that they cannot win and their participants know
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:44.160]  it hence rioting is not revolutionary but reactionary because it invites
[2:34:44.160 --> 2:34:48.840]  defeat it involves an emotional catharsis but it must be followed by a
[2:34:48.840 --> 2:34:53.840]  sense of futility and that's from somebody who actually changed society
[2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:59.840]  through nonviolent civil disobedience and as we've stressed on many occasions
[2:34:59.840 --> 2:35:04.960]  the only thing that violent riots are going to achieve is a to demonize
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:11.320]  legitimate protesters in the eyes of the general public be to enlist to enlist
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:15.840]  the support of the middle class to the police state when they cheer on the
[2:35:15.840 --> 2:35:19.600]  police cracking the head of the anarchist thugs in response to the
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:24.080]  violence and at the end they don't have to crack the heads of the anarchist thugs
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:27.840]  they step back then they attack the peaceful crowd that even happened at
[2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:32.080]  the emergency cracking the heads of anyone basically if they're told it
[2:35:32.080 --> 2:35:36.240]  it's the same group of people who are doing the violence then they'll support
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:40.800]  it at the end of the day I mean every time a black block anarchist thugs
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:46.000]  smashes another Burger King window or whatever they're helping the very system
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:50.480]  that they claim they are fighting that's what it comes down to they don't
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:55.080]  achieve anything by smashing up a city for a day they just achieve
[2:35:55.080 --> 2:35:59.560]  society let's be clear within a society that still has some freedom where you
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:06.640]  still have a chance to peaceably expose the system is corrupt to fix it then
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:09.920]  nonviolence is the way to go if it goes into like a nazi situation rounding
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:14.040]  people up and all that then it goes to the next level but it's trying to stop
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:19.120]  it from going to that next level we want to be peaceful right and then whenever
[2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:24.640]  you research who's behind the group that have been violent it's always cops and
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:30.120]  authorities in the Italy Canada even in China where the Tibetans had the riot
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:36.240]  last year they are photographs came out of the police chief running around with
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:40.280]  machetes these photographs were later airbrushed and you know the machetes were
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:44.280]  taken out when it was revealed that the police chiefs were all stirring up the
[2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:50.800]  violent riot so what also came out what also came out was squads of police in
[2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:56.320]  open-air areas with a photo snap this was confirmed dressing like monks to go
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:00.280]  out and cause the violence so we need to do a master article that you're so good
[2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:04.680]  at Paul where we show all these confirmed examples of the state doing
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:08.120]  this I mean look at how the feds bombed Oklahoma City to get a police state
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:11.800]  going on you know the people always post on the comment boards on info wars in
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:16.400]  prison planet oh you're well she'd call for violence but notice you know that
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:20.200]  they're not out committing violence they want us to do it but then the feds and
[2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:23.040]  globalists are always cut staging violence because it helps them see
[2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:27.600]  they're doing it because it helps them we're right that it's not good yeah I
[2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.320]  mean it violence only begets more violence I mean that's that's what they
[2:37:32.320 --> 2:37:37.720]  want they want a Tiananmen Square type situation where they get the perceived
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:42.240]  justification for a complete brutal crackdown which is exactly what will
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:48.880]  happen God forbid if it does but if there's some kind of false flag attempt
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:54.000]  during this week G20 then that will give them all the justification they need
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:59.200]  they got shoot to kill orders still in effect and that will give them whatever
[2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:06.640]  justification they need for a crackdown that goes beyond anything we've seen any
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:13.120]  other research Paul Watson no that's it I'm just this is coming out of the
[2:38:13.120 --> 2:38:16.520]  and at the black block anarchist groups themselves and it's coming from the very
[2:38:16.520 --> 2:38:20.200]  top that's saying it's going to be a summer of rage so it's kind of a stealth
[2:38:20.200 --> 2:38:25.120]  fulfilling prophecy I'm worried about it and I don't want to see it happen so
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:30.880]  hopefully nothing major happens this week but if it does obviously we'll be
[2:38:30.880 --> 2:38:38.360]  all over it like why on rice all right briefly prison planet dot TV we could
[2:38:38.360 --> 2:38:42.040]  have launched it last week we've been so busy the 2.0 version and we're going to
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:45.760]  add more and more features and functions to it this is just phase one we're
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:49.840]  launching this week and phase two phase three everything prison planet dot TV
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:54.080]  members get which then finances so much what we do here so it's a win-win Paul
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:57.520]  tell folks some of the features of the current prison planet dot TV and what's
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:04.280]  coming well with the new one we've listened to what people wanted to change
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:10.200]  and what to add to it and Andre and the crew have done an absolutely fantastic
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:14.080]  job they're just tweaking it it's in the final stages now to be released
[2:39:14.080 --> 2:39:19.200]  probably at some point this week and it's completely user-friendly I mean it's
[2:39:19.200 --> 2:39:25.400]  got searchable archives going back five years since we started it for example
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.440]  you know if you wanted to go and watch a show that you did where you interviewed
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:35.720]  say Ray McGovern for example you could just click on the page Alex Jones live
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:41.240]  type in the search box McGovern and the video results the search results will
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:44.760]  pop up and you can just click and watch the interview right there so it's that
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:50.200]  kind of user-friendly functionality that's being added and it's the same
[2:39:50.200 --> 2:39:55.480]  with the Alex Jones movies you can flip between all the movies within an
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:58.600]  instant and just click the ones you want to watch and it'll start playing
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:03.480]  immediately with the flash player and you've got downloads as well of course
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:10.520]  because it's been running since April 2004 there's literally thousands of
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:17.720]  pieces of media going back to 2004 which can also be searched by month by year
[2:40:17.720 --> 2:40:22.360]  so it's everything's right at your fingertips and by the way we uploaded
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:25.360]  some of the films five years ago in decent quality but compared to today
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:29.080]  it's nothing we're gonna reupload some of my older films in the newest highest
[2:40:29.080 --> 2:40:32.760]  quality here in the next few weeks we're gonna have a MySpace type area that's
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:37.600]  really works well and it has a lot of things you can change and do a message
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:41.040]  board just for members there's a whole bunch of other functions we're gonna be
[2:40:41.040 --> 2:40:45.240]  adding and now you get the two hours I simulcast of the four hour show at

[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:08.120]  Alabama Kim thanks for holding her on the air hey Alex hi I wanted to go back
[2:42:08.120 --> 2:42:11.920]  to Friday show I believe it was Friday show where you had doctor Dr. Whitaker on
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:17.400]  and y'all spoke of cancer treatments I wanted to share with everybody there as
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:27.040]  a doctor in Rome named Julio Simoncini who has he spoke at the 2008 Cancer
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:33.840]  Convention in LA and he's treating people with sodium bicarbonate making soda
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:40.200]  three dollars worth of it and it and they're they're healed but what bugs me
[2:42:40.200 --> 2:42:46.120]  is it not a doctor in America has picked up on this and well let me just
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:48.680]  add I mean there's a lot of doctors that claim this or that but it is true that
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:53.240]  pH has been found that's why people get off the meat get off the cheese get in
[2:42:53.240 --> 2:42:58.720]  the in the tons of fruit tons of organic stuff and you know tons of vegetables
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:02.240]  and things and exercise that that's a big part of it in mainline medical
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:05.640]  science is having to admit that more and more and start incorporating that it's
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:10.580]  but yeah I mean there's a lot of evidence to show that if people would
[2:43:10.580 --> 2:43:16.480]  just go online and just do a search how to make my body more alkaline they
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:19.720]  wouldn't get cancer but the cancer print cannot grow in an alkaline
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:26.120]  environment we're all acidic and that's where it takes hold of us that is a big
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:31.960]  hmm that is a big part of it that's a big part of it Kim yeah if people will
[2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:38.640]  just go can I give you some websites sure all right the first one is no KNOW
[2:43:38.640 --> 2:43:45.720]  thecause.com then you click on shows then click on dr. Simoncini all right

[2:44:20.840 --> 2:44:25.320]  on the air hi sir and thank you for taking my call I love the show by the way
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:30.360]  um well second time caller and I love the show yeah I've just been listening to you

[2:44:36.400 --> 2:44:42.040]  please thank you one minute woman it's so loud I can barely hear you I'm sure
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:47.320]  that you don't hear a British EastEnders sorry about that yeah basically you see
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:54.040]  you see what's in about the G2 or cement tomorrow and the the way that
[2:44:54.040 --> 2:44:59.240]  British government will put people in to antagonistic to correct situations for
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:03.400]  innocent protesters to be hurt if you go back to like like the Yorkshire I mean
[2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:07.480]  Yorkshire persons are Yorkshire in England by the way for you in the US and I
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:11.880]  remember the Yorkshire miners strike and I remember there the government did the
[2:45:11.880 --> 2:45:15.440]  same thing it was thatcherism and for them people that don't know where my
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:20.680]  got thatcher is she's a big politician in the UK was a prime minister I'm
[2:45:20.680 --> 2:45:24.960]  basically I grew up in the 80s and a group with thatcherism as a whole and I
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:28.840]  remember the kid grew up in the 80s in the miners strike and seeing how
[2:45:28.840 --> 2:45:33.480]  people will provoke or even that the miners strike were working out working
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:38.280]  field from the northern England northern part of England and I'm basically
[2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:43.080]  they will they would get police from the southern England she comes in to the
[2:45:43.080 --> 2:45:48.680]  northern part to dominate and obviously to start trouble what's your take on
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:54.200]  that what do you think will happen tomorrow you know I mean every other
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:58.720]  time they hire thugs it comes out always a week after the police hire thugs or do
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:01.760]  it themselves and they don't get in trouble for it they just go the police
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:06.840]  gotta go yeah we did it but we're gonna take your rights to keep you safe and
[2:46:06.840 --> 2:46:09.520]  they'll arrest somebody who had fireworks at their house or somebody who had a
[2:46:09.520 --> 2:46:13.280]  bottle of whiskey claiming it's a bio weapon you know that's what they do it's
[2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:16.680]  all the trainers were all terrorists that's what the body scanners going in
[2:46:16.680 --> 2:46:19.760]  all the major airports are to scan your neck and body that's what throwing away
[2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:23.080]  your toothpaste or water as teacher or criminal taking your shoes off
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:27.760]  winding you it's an act of submission to train you to be a good slave good to
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:33.080]  hear from you Matt from the UK Steve in Chicago you're on the air Steve yes

[2:46:53.840 --> 2:46:58.160]  thought the authenticity of those foreign speakers in your EU tape that you

[2:56:36.360 --> 2:56:40.400]  today I don't understand what that guy was saying about the about the tape but
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:46.000]  sounds like he was smoking something anyway I wanted to bring to your
[2:56:46.000 --> 2:56:50.240]  attention something called the ISDA I don't know if you're familiar with that
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:54.960]  yes international swaps and derivatives association they've been around since
[2:56:54.960 --> 2:57:00.920]  1985 since the inception of the idea of derivatives and there's all kinds of
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:06.000]  information on that site and it looks like they're planning on fixing a
[2:57:06.000 --> 2:57:16.320]  derivative with the performance of European Union state to offset the
[2:57:16.320 --> 2:57:22.640]  negative value yeah they're gonna call it starting new derivatives bubble through
[2:57:22.640 --> 2:57:26.440]  carbon credits this is all stated and Al Gore and Obama own part of the
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:30.520]  companies and it's just total conflict of interest and they're calling it a
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:35.560]  global European Union and Gordon Brown speech yeah there's all kinds of
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.800]  information on that site they've got yearly activities reviews going all the
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:44.080]  way back on that site and I bet if somebody that knew what they were
[2:57:44.080 --> 2:57:47.800]  looking at and look through that they could see a paper trail going all the
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:54.080]  way back on their designs for the world economy on that one website it's I
[2:57:54.080 --> 2:57:57.840]  created this fiat bubble to buy up all the real assets that implode it make
[2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:01.960]  everybody an interest surf to them yeah
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:06.040]  the way I thought that was interesting it'd be really nice to see someone like
[2:58:06.040 --> 2:58:09.000]  Webster Tarpley take a look at that site and see if they could actually find some
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:14.640]  hard evidence from internally what do you think of the Boston Globe report that
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:18.080]  they admit they took the pension insurance money and invested it in
[2:58:18.080 --> 2:58:26.920]  derivatives and things completely amazing to me that's not only have they
[2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:29.920]  done you know planned all this stuff for the last 50 years but now they're just
[2:58:29.920 --> 2:58:35.800]  openly stating it in public you know I hear you brother good to hear from you

[3:00:17.960 --> 3:00:21.660]  the People Foundation the beginning of a series we're going to do the next two
[3:00:21.660 --> 3:00:25.800]  weeks plus in the tax time with the private banker takeover he'll be joining
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:29.360]  us for the last 45 minutes of the show today right now we're taking your phone
[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:35.400]  calls John in the great state of Texas you're on the air John welcome hey what's
[3:00:35.400 --> 3:00:40.160]  going on Alex can talk to you I just like to say first I have a enormous
[3:00:40.160 --> 3:00:43.880]  respect for you so I've got a four-month-old at home and I know what
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:46.560]  kind of sacrifice you have to do spend all this time and energy away from your
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:52.440]  family I also like to say I really liked your idea a couple weeks ago you were
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:55.840]  talking about having either a show or a series of shows where you just had law
[3:00:55.840 --> 3:00:58.760]  enforcement calling because you were saying that they always say that they
[3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:02.360]  never get a chance to call in I think that would be really important oh my
[3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:06.400]  gosh you just reminded me of another show I promised to do but it's all the
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:09.240]  taxes financial stuff that really weighs me down dealing with the
[3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:13.280]  infrastructure 20-plus employees for me it's a learning experience but I
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:17.800]  promise to do a big two-hour concentration camp show today I guess I'll
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:21.480]  do it later this week ahead of Glenn Beck's debunking of it with popular
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:26.840]  mechanics next Monday so I've got to guess not go home today I was planning
[3:01:26.840 --> 3:01:29.200]  to go see the family for about three hours but I've made that promise and
[3:01:29.200 --> 3:01:35.600]  it's important to get all that data back together and go over it all but well
[3:01:35.600 --> 3:01:42.680]  we're gonna do that but what else is on your mind sir nothing just that you
[3:01:42.680 --> 3:01:46.640]  know listen every day and this stuff just that last call or not the last
[3:01:46.640 --> 3:01:51.800]  call with that guy you know people just debate the most ridiculous issues when
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:56.520]  you know the truth is right there in front of them you know I always think
[3:01:56.520 --> 3:02:00.080]  I've heard you mentioned several times it's you know it's either tyranny or
[3:02:00.080 --> 3:02:03.040]  freedom like you know once we have freedom we can debate all this other
[3:02:03.040 --> 3:02:08.520]  stuff you know yeah and and you know it all becomes an obsession with me when
[3:02:08.520 --> 3:02:11.720]  we have this track record of success a track record of telling the truth the
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:15.200]  track record of building people up and not infighting a track record to try to
[3:02:15.200 --> 3:02:18.720]  get folks to walk their own road just to wake up to the systems manipulating them
[3:02:18.720 --> 3:02:22.480]  and instead as we get bigger and bigger I find that a lot of folks that are
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:26.120]  anti-New World Order they're just mad at anybody who's successful including the
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:29.080]  elite they don't even want us to be successful fighting the globalists and
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:33.360]  as we have success that almost upsets them and we can't be for real because
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:39.640]  we're having success I mean it's a it's a it's like a plan to fail you know type
[3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:42.240]  deal that's built in but it doesn't matter we just got to ignore it move
[3:02:42.240 --> 3:02:45.560]  forward so we don't have a choice this stuff's coming down on us I mean all I'm
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:48.840]  doing is putting out the info we post almost everything we talk about on the
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:53.560]  show right here on the websites info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and it's
[3:02:53.560 --> 3:02:58.040]  not about Alex Jones it's about the information and I almost cringe every
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:02.200]  time I release a hit movie or you know it gets some huge guess because for me
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:05.160]  it's about getting the word out and expanding the paradigm of liberty and
[3:03:05.160 --> 3:03:08.200]  freedom and shattering the false liberal paradigm but then I know it means
[3:03:08.200 --> 3:03:12.840]  howls of more people from the establishment from the left the right
[3:03:12.840 --> 3:03:18.440]  from the grassroots just getting more frothing towards me because you know I
[3:03:18.440 --> 3:03:21.920]  just rubbed some people the wrong way in it but I overall am the most
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:26.120]  successful waking people up because of you the listeners who take action so
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:29.320]  we're just got to move forward together and do whatever we can it's just that
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:33.720]  now year after year people try to manufacture lies about me year after
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:37.600]  year they've tried to invent things and just incredible propaganda and it's all
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:41.720]  bull it's all discredited but it just kind of mixes together in this big
[3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:46.240]  amalgam of delusionalness and it doesn't upset me that I'm being attacked it
[3:03:46.240 --> 3:03:51.240]  upsets me that these people are that crazy and that that's what discredits us
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:55.280]  is that frankly just because the establishment lies or spins doesn't
[3:03:55.280 --> 3:03:58.800]  mean in the whole massive humanity the establishment comes from humanity it
[3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:03.120]  you know it just takes all kinds but I don't know I mean just knowing what's
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:07.040]  coming down on us I can't believe that people have turned this into like a
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:11.040]  high school who's cool who's not you know and everybody hates the football
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:15.200]  captain and then you know it's so much fun and folks I'm not your football
[3:04:15.200 --> 3:04:19.480]  captain I'm somebody here risking my life busting my butt to look at the amount
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:24.080]  of work we do look at the dedication look at the fruits of the tree you talked
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:27.760]  to 80% of people what will keep the new world order it in Ron Paul it's Alex
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:31.040]  Jones Ron Paul came on the show last year and said half our support's been
[3:04:31.040 --> 3:04:36.080]  from your show I didn't prompt him to say that and they do but like Rodney
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:39.840]  Dangerfield said I still can't get any respect what were you saying they would
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:43.480]  do five seconds of research they would find out that you know you put all your
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:46.520]  information out there for free it's not about Alex Jones like you said you know
[3:04:46.520 --> 3:04:52.520]  it's about the info I hear your brother got a jump more call straight ahead it's

[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:33.280]  radio network
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:36.800]  before I take a few calls and we're going to get Bob Schell's with the people
[3:08:36.800 --> 3:08:42.160]  foundation on I wanted to play this clip this is from Fox News that you're
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:46.880]  about to see of Hannity and Dick Morris admitting the new world order global
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:50.360]  takeover and admitting that we the conspiracy theorist are right because we
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:54.400]  knew how to read government documents 1015 20 years ago that's all we are
[3:08:54.400 --> 3:08:57.800]  people that did research and we're evil we're bad I understand that that's why
[3:08:57.800 --> 3:09:00.040]  there's all these police reports demonizing us but now they've been
[3:09:00.040 --> 3:09:03.960]  forced to retract those in Missouri and other places because no we're the
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:07.440]  patriots we're the good guys we're not the ones stealing your pensions like the
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:11.160]  foreign banks here's the video clip they campaign as moderates did you ever
[3:09:11.160 --> 3:09:14.480]  think in our lifetime we'd be getting lectures from the communist Chinese on
[3:09:14.480 --> 3:09:19.240]  capitalism that Nicholas Sarkozy and other leaders of France that we'd be
[3:09:19.240 --> 3:09:22.880]  getting we'll be criticizing us for spending too much criticizing America and
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:27.680]  warning America interestingly not to go down the path to socialism there is a
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:31.320]  big thing that's going to happen in London at this G20 and then they're
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:34.600]  hiding it they're camouflaging it they're not talking about it
[3:09:34.600 --> 3:09:40.040]  coordination of international regulation what they are going to do is to put
[3:09:40.040 --> 3:09:45.760]  our Fed and our SEC under the control in effect of the IMF oh come on they'll
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:49.320]  believe they'll do this that's what was in the draft agenda they call it
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:54.120]  coordination of regulation what it really is is putting the American economy
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:09:58.560]  under international regulation yeah and those people who have been yelling oh
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:02.280]  the UN's gonna take over global conspiracy theorists they consider they've
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:06.520]  been crazy but now they're right yeah well when guy it's happening when
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:10.320]  guidance said it would be open to the idea of a global currency last second
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:15.400]  yeah those conspiracy people had said and suggested that for years you're not
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:20.920]  wrong and you know it's what they always do with these conferences is they have
[3:10:20.920 --> 3:10:24.680]  this the center show is here and the sideshow they don't want you to pay
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:28.800]  attention to the center show is the size of the stimulus package yeah the real
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:33.600]  show is international regulation of the financial institutions which is gonna
[3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:37.920]  happen under the IMF control and remember the IMF is run by Europeans
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:42.600]  World Bank by Americans tick morris.com thanks dick appreciate and coming
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:48.200]  well I told you before I even knew this this morning last night that I'm
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:53.880]  listening to XM now I don't just listen to WAI or KLBJ 590 or the Houston
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:10:57.760]  talkstations Dallas talkstations I would flip through those and monitor and I
[3:10:57.760 --> 3:11:01.520]  would hear the talking points you know do this in the morning do this in the
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:05.240]  evening my wife says go get milk at the grocery store at you know 11 at night
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:10.120]  she forgets to get it I'm driving down there I listen now I got XM and man it
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:15.360]  just bam bam bam bam Japanese Russian news in English all the
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:19.600]  conservative shows all the liberal shows and they're going I'm losing my
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:24.040]  pension fund the new world order is real look folks we didn't just guess there was
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:28.000]  a global currency being set up we didn't just guess they were gonna bankrupt the
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:32.400]  world economy by design to do it we got the IMF World Bank documents in 2002 in
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:37.880]  January I wrote a book about it to send a tyranny as chapters on it all we've
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:41.160]  done is try to warn people and now it's here they're taking your pension funds
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:47.400]  everything I mean I don't know what I'm supposed to do and you know what they
[3:11:47.400 --> 3:11:50.840]  don't tell you is the CFR with five that almost five thousand members in the
[3:11:50.840 --> 3:11:54.280]  US openly calls for world government's been setting this up they don't tell you
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:56.920]  Geithner's going along with it they don't tell you both parties are
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:00.200]  controlled but I guess they're gonna have to now in the near future because
[3:12:00.200 --> 3:12:04.840]  it's all happening look we always said for 14 years I've been on air because I
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:07.760]  was talking to the experts you know the old dogs and the five been doing it for
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:11.900]  decades many of them dead now and these are were colonels and generals in the
[3:12:11.900 --> 3:12:15.760]  military these were you know auditors for the IRS these were people who've been
[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:20.240]  in the government been invited into this and that's how they knew the plan and
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:26.240]  then we got the documents and we knew this and that's how we told you
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:29.920]  everything that was gonna happen and I made films and books and we're on record
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:35.160]  and of course we're right but we don't deserve any special credit we just did
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:40.160]  the research it's like I talk about the analogy is
[3:12:40.640 --> 3:12:44.600]  knowing all the stuff's like knowing what's coming on TV tonight it's a TV
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:51.000]  guide my wife will call sometimes and say hey there's a James Bond movie on TV
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:54.960]  tonight you want to watch it back when I had such you know time to do things
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:59.440]  years ago and I'd say yeah and then I come home and the movies on TV and you
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.960]  know we sit around and you know eat a late night dinner whatever the kids are
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:07.600]  sleeping watch it and it isn't like she's psychic and I bow down to her and go
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:10.560]  my gosh how did you know James Bond was on the night or how does you know the
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:15.720]  Super Bowl was on this Sunday it's all openly announced all we're doing is
[3:13:15.720 --> 3:13:22.760]  telling you what they've publicly said that's all what they won't tell you at
[3:13:22.760 --> 3:13:26.240]  Fox is well guess they do now they put out a video a month ago we played it
[3:13:26.240 --> 3:13:30.600]  here put out by Fox with all these movie stars and TV starts saying Fox movies
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:36.240]  Fox TV Fox and all of it is programming to accept global carbon tax and global
[3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:43.360]  government and they Rupert Murdoch is at the very top of the upper echelon of
[3:13:43.360 --> 3:13:47.680]  power he's all for you know his papers and TV stations he owns in Europe push
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:52.640]  and promote this and bash the United States but then here he says none of
[3:13:52.640 --> 3:13:56.640]  it's going on and then bash is Europe see it's all about playing us off against
[3:13:56.640 --> 3:14:02.360]  each other go ahead and get Bob Schultz on for us we're gonna take calls to
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:08.760]  coming up with him on with us but for about it's holding it's very exhausting
[3:14:08.760 --> 3:14:16.200]  though because I have a passion to expose this and I can't control myself not
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:20.800]  to expose it I mean there are hundreds of stories we break hundreds of things
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:24.600]  we cover a lot of original documents bills we read we put it out first it's
[3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:28.720]  a lot of attention it's not it's only because I can't control myself and I
[3:14:28.720 --> 3:14:32.840]  just can't stop reading and researching and documenting and then going over it
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:37.120]  all and I have this literal tingle in my stomach goosebumps you know on my neck
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:43.320]  hair standing up because it isn't just a global currency in a global government
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:47.080]  global regulations and carbon taxes they say once they have that in place
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:50.840]  they're gonna stage a lot of more terror attacks blame it on shadowy enemies
[3:14:50.840 --> 3:14:58.080]  lock down the cities even more you think people dying of vaccines is bad now you
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:00.920]  think all the soft-kill weapons are bad now this has all just been beta testing
[3:15:00.920 --> 3:15:04.720]  then it gets even more horrific I mean once you're in the new world order it's
[3:15:04.720 --> 3:15:08.960]  bad so we always knew that when they finally made the big move they've been
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:11.640]  setting it up behind the scenes for a long time they would have to announce it
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:16.720]  and that was their strong point and their weak point their flux point where
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:19.600]  things aren't as rigid where where they're reaching in trying to remold the
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:23.760]  world the architecture we can reach in and stop what they're doing you know the
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:33.720]  struggle is now the key crossroads you know there'll be Bob Schultz many times
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:37.880]  but I guess I don't have his bio today I'd like to go over his bio as we go to
[3:15:37.880 --> 3:15:41.200]  him here Bob just introduce yourself tell folks a little bit about your
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:44.480]  background and corporate stuff and then how you woke up to the private
[3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:47.960]  Federal Reserve in the scam and then I want to talk about the nature of it and
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:50.720]  everything but also talk about how it comes out all these IRS agents don't
[3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:54.560]  pay it most the Congress doesn't pay it most of Obama's administration doesn't
[3:15:54.560 --> 3:15:58.240]  pay it a lot of the governors don't pay it they're all just a bunch of them
[3:15:58.240 --> 3:16:01.280]  they don't even pay this thing we didn't have it till 1913 built the nation
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:04.760]  without it it all goes to pay interest to the private bankers you know I mean
[3:16:04.760 --> 3:16:09.400]  it's just it's such a fraud like the war on drugs and everything else so Bob
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:13.000]  Schultz with the People Foundation founder it's good to have you on with us
[3:16:13.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  today hey Alex great to be on again thank you bio I'm a got an engineering

[3:16:51.320 --> 3:16:55.400]  some work I was doing there the Republican governor of Connecticut a
[3:16:55.400 --> 3:16:58.720]  fellow named Mascol asked if I would go to Connecticut and start up and
[3:16:58.720 --> 3:17:02.160]  administer a new state agency get some laws on the books in Connecticut in this
[3:17:02.160 --> 3:17:06.600]  field that I was specializing in was there for three years did that came back
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:11.280]  to New York the Democrat governor of New York Hugh Carey asked if I would run a
[3:17:11.280 --> 3:17:14.920]  policy office to try and get some laws on the books in New York in this field
[3:17:14.920 --> 3:17:19.080]  that I was specializing in I did that it was a full-time advisor to the
[3:17:19.080 --> 3:17:23.720]  administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to hire to try and get
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:29.040]  some business principles embedded in this huge huge public works bureaucratic
[3:17:29.040 --> 3:17:33.400]  program under the Clean Water Act that funds a lot of the nation's sewer and
[3:17:33.400 --> 3:17:38.320]  waterworks there for a year was an investment banking with Prudential
[3:17:38.320 --> 3:17:44.120]  Bates securities on the public finance side for four or five years started up a
[3:17:44.120 --> 3:17:51.680]  management consulting company and I don't know woke up when I was 40 something
[3:17:51.680 --> 3:17:56.320]  happened in my neighborhood in upstate New York I realized the government was
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:18:03.160]  manufacturing a crisis and had prescribed a solution that was going to
[3:18:03.160 --> 3:18:07.560]  benefit a few of them and their friends but at everybody else's expense which is
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:11.560]  bad enough but to make matters worse they're going to violate the law in the
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:17.080]  process so I tried to get some questions answered they wouldn't answer the
[3:18:17.080 --> 3:18:22.760]  questions I had to go to court and in a very robust decision the highest court
[3:18:22.760 --> 3:18:26.880]  in the state gave us everything we were asking for under the results of a
[3:18:26.880 --> 3:18:30.880]  countywide referendum they had brought the people to the polls by their nose is
[3:18:30.880 --> 3:18:34.360]  telling the people based on entirely what the government was telling and they
[3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:39.240]  went ahead and approve this project and but we undid the results of a countywide
[3:18:39.240 --> 3:18:43.280]  referendum and nullified the resolutions passed by all the town and county
[3:18:43.280 --> 3:18:48.160]  boards in approving and financing the project but that changed my view of
[3:18:48.160 --> 3:18:52.160]  government until then I have been led to believe that government was always
[3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:55.520]  benevolent always had the public interest up above in its mind and that
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:18:58.120]  these were the good guys you could trust these people except for the you know I
[3:18:58.120 --> 3:19:00.440]  could now and then somebody got caught with their hand in the cookie job but
[3:19:00.440 --> 3:19:05.800]  all of that changed and then a few years later I was the subject of some
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:10.520]  retaliation by the town that was the lead defendant in that case so now I'm
[3:19:10.520 --> 3:19:13.880]  not only learned that government is not above manufacturing a crisis but they
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:19.200]  can hurt you simply because they don't like you they they they can be vindictive
[3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:25.120]  so I decided it was my responsibility as an American to start paying better
[3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:30.080]  attention to be better informed about what my rights were under the state and
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:37.480]  federal constitutions of course but also what the well but start paying more
[3:19:37.480 --> 3:19:40.480]  attention to what government was actually saying and doing it comparing its
[3:19:40.480 --> 3:19:44.200]  behavior to the week with the requirements of our state and federal
[3:19:44.200 --> 3:19:48.080]  constitution for a long time Bob you've been talking about the derivatives

[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:56.360]  We are back live, Bob Schultz with the People Foundation. This is impossible to cover all the good work they've done.
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:25:02.680]  National ads exposing the IRS as a scam, unconstitutional, never ratified, IRS
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:06.880]  agents hearing it, researching it for years, Treasury agents going public, being
[3:25:06.880 --> 3:25:12.480]  indicted, being found not guilty in courts. I mean this has been hellish, but
[3:25:12.480 --> 3:25:18.560]  if hunger strikes, congressmen involved, just an amazing individual. Okay, we've
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:22.080]  recapped how you woke up. Now, how you got into the IRS, what's currently
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:25.720]  happening, the world government coming out in the open, Bob Schultz, I mean our
[3:25:25.720 --> 3:25:34.240]  credibility now couldn't be higher. It is the platinum standard. Yes, after 20
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:42.640]  years of confronting governmental wrongdoing in New York State, I turned
[3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:50.400]  my attention to the federal government in 1999 and one of the first
[3:25:50.400 --> 3:25:59.040]  issues that, well, we brought an action against Clinton and Robert Rubin, who was
[3:25:59.040 --> 3:26:04.080]  the Treasury Secretary at the time regarding the bailout of the Mexican
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:09.920]  peso. And Janet Reno asked the court to dismiss the case based on sovereign
[3:26:09.920 --> 3:26:13.040]  immunity, saying that the government was sovereign, we had no right to sue it. Of
[3:26:13.040 --> 3:26:17.240]  course, we prevailed there. But then eventually the court dismissed the case
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:23.480]  for lack of standing. We brought an action against the president, the chairman
[3:26:23.480 --> 3:26:28.000]  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense for applying the
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:32.080]  armed forces of the United States in hostilities overseas in the Republic of
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:37.040]  Yugoslavia without a declaration of war as the Constitution requires. The court
[3:26:37.040 --> 3:26:42.160]  dismissed that action in 1999. We then turned our attention, learned about
[3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:46.840]  Joe Bannister, turned our attention to help him get answers to the questions
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:53.680]  that he asked his superiors at the IRS office in San Jose. Yeah, he was a
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:58.520]  Treasury armed agent as part of their enforcement bureau. Yes, a special agent
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:03.120]  criminal investigation division of Badge, a gun, extremely bright young man. And he
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:07.040]  heard DV kid. He'd been there seven years, making a great money, doing good, loved,
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:11.680]  whole family and law enforcement. He hears DV kid on Bay Area radio, stops his
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:16.040]  car, writes notes. He's going to expose this liar about the IRS being a scam and
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:20.280]  sending money to foreign banks. And he did two years of research. We were the
[3:27:20.280 --> 3:27:26.000]  first to interview him. And boom, he thought it was all true. Exactly. And so
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:29.040]  he submitted a report to his superiors, simply asking them to help him
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:33.800]  understand and answer some questions. And rather than do that, they showed him the
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:39.720]  door. They forced them out. We learned about that and decided to help him get
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:48.880]  answers to his questions. And we went through years of attempting to get the
[3:27:48.880 --> 3:27:54.480]  government to address these issues and answer these questions. Everything from
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:28:03.120]  full page ads in the USA Today, as you say, a hunger fest. We had press
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:09.160]  conferences covered by C-SPAN at the National Press Club, which we had Joe
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:15.680]  Bannister and Bill Benson and Larry Becraft, but to no avail. And so that
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:21.400]  was the first of the federal issues that we attacked with petitioning for a
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:28.200]  remedy to this grievance and government refusing to respond. We turned our
[3:28:28.200 --> 3:28:32.320]  attention, and we're still attempting to get the government to respond to those
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:37.800]  questions. But along the way, we decided to start focusing on other violations of
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:43.000]  the Constitution. And so we've petitioned the government for a remedy to various
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:47.120]  other grievances involving violations of the Constitution, including the
[3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:50.320]  government's violation of the, again, the War Powers Clause under the Iraq
[3:28:50.320 --> 3:28:55.600]  Resolution, with the Iraq Resolution. We've petitioned them for a redress of
[3:28:55.600 --> 3:29:01.040]  the grievance regarding the violation of the so-called Privacy Clause by the USA
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:06.040]  Patriot Act, the Federal Reserve Act, and its violation of the Money Clause.
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:13.480]  We've petitioned over the government's development. All the facts suggest the
[3:29:13.480 --> 3:29:19.040]  government is developing a North American Union, which would effectively, as you
[3:29:19.040 --> 3:29:22.640]  know, obliterate our northern and southern boundaries. I don't mind if
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:27.320]  Mexico is the 51st state, Canada is the 52nd, if they apply for statehood, and
[3:29:27.320 --> 3:29:29.920]  they're approved, and they have state constitutions that guarantee their
[3:29:29.920 --> 3:29:33.800]  citizens the rights that our state comes from. That's right. Under globalist systems,
[3:29:33.800 --> 3:29:37.600]  you don't have that. Under globalist systems, you don't have that.
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:40.640]  Bob Schultz's long segment coming up, plenty of time to get into this. Let's
[3:29:40.640 --> 3:29:44.360]  talk about the latest with the IRS, as they're fully discredited. It turns out
[3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:47.160]  most of the folks, literally most of the people in the government, aren't even
[3:29:47.160 --> 3:29:50.520]  paying the stinking thanks, as they know it's a fraud too. Stay with us, we'll be right
[3:29:50.520 --> 3:30:00.200]  by it. We're on the march, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:00.920 --> 3:30:05.360]  Hello, this is Steve Schenck. Alex has told you you have to get a supply of food,
[3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:08.640]  but Alex and I have decided that there are some of you that we really don't
[3:30:08.640 --> 3:30:12.360]  want to have food. If you're a politician who voted for the bailout, don't call
[3:30:12.360 --> 3:30:16.800]  eFoods direct. If you agree with one guy screaming about global warming instead

[3:30:22.120 --> 3:30:25.960]  you think growing food for cars is better than feeding people, don't get food. If
[3:30:25.960 --> 3:30:29.160]  you think waiting for a cop to show up after a crime is better than defending
[3:30:29.160 --> 3:30:32.960]  yourself and preventing the crime, don't call eFoods direct. If you believe the
[3:30:32.960 --> 3:30:37.120]  official report on 9-11, you won't need food. If you think the warnings on the
[3:30:37.120 --> 3:30:41.360]  Alex Jones show are foolish, don't call eFoods direct. For the rest of you, go

[3:31:01.800 --> 3:31:06.360]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the
[3:31:06.360 --> 3:31:11.320]  tip of the spear. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as
[3:31:11.320 --> 3:31:17.320]  powerful, just as strong, just as well funded. The Obama deception completely
[3:31:17.320 --> 3:31:21.160]  destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American
[3:31:21.160 --> 3:31:25.640]  people. While Obama's already fudging, yeah, fudged since day one in this
[3:31:25.640 --> 3:31:29.880]  election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:31:29.880 --> 3:31:35.560]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:40.480]  oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world
[3:31:40.480 --> 3:31:46.720]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his
[3:31:46.720 --> 3:31:52.920]  real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or

[3:32:04.760 --> 3:32:08.040]  water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[3:32:08.040 --> 3:32:11.560]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many
[3:32:11.560 --> 3:32:15.000]  chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:19.800]  skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and
[3:32:19.800 --> 3:32:24.120]  is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the
[3:32:24.120 --> 3:32:29.320]  growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus. The KDF dual media shower filter
[3:32:29.320 --> 3:32:33.640]  typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first. Hospitals,
[3:32:33.640 --> 3:32:37.320]  restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,
[3:32:37.320 --> 3:32:41.800]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter

[3:35:36.920 --> 3:35:40.040]  non-hybrid seeds means having the ability to grow an endless supply of
[3:35:40.040 --> 3:35:43.080]  nutrient-dense food to feed your loved ones. There have been times in American
[3:35:43.080 --> 3:35:46.120]  history, pilgrim for example, when seeds have the highest value of any barter
[3:35:46.120 --> 3:35:49.000]  item. Even silver or gold. There's a war on against
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:51.800]  non-hybrid seeds waged by the global elite who want to control us by
[3:35:51.800 --> 3:35:54.760]  controlling the food supply. The governments are storing seeds.
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:57.880]  The UN is storing seeds. Globalists of every striper storing seeds are the
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:00.360]  Arctic Circle. Why do you think this is? You know why.
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:03.640]  Control and power. Solutions from science is trying to get
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:06.840]  seeds out of the globalist's hands and the hands of the people. One seed bank at

[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:36.840]  We want to thank our sponsors because they also make this transmission
[3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:39.160]  possible. Be sure and support our local affiliates
[3:36:39.160 --> 3:36:42.840]  sponsors as well. They make this radio show possible. Now,
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:46.440]  going back to Bob Schultz with People Foundation, specifically tell folks about
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:49.720]  the work you've done encapsulating that what's currently going on with the
[3:36:49.720 --> 3:36:54.280]  criminal IRS and then tie that in. I'm sure you're up on this.
[3:36:54.280 --> 3:36:57.080]  How it's coming out that a lot of the government doesn't pay their taxes
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:37:03.400]  including the Treasury Secretary. That's true. We have folks in government
[3:37:03.400 --> 3:37:07.320]  that continue to act as though they are, you know, privileged
[3:37:07.320 --> 3:37:11.640]  daughter-crats. Well, they enslave the rest of us believing
[3:37:11.640 --> 3:37:16.040]  they're they're above the law. The rest of us
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:20.440]  can read and comprehend. Thousands of people continue to read and comprehend.
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:23.880]  Cannot find the law that makes them liable.
[3:37:23.880 --> 3:37:27.240]  Many of them are small businessmen. They can't find the law that makes them.
[3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:32.440]  That requires them to withhold pay earned by their employees. We continue to
[3:37:32.440 --> 3:37:36.920]  many individuals cannot find the law that requires them to file and pay this tax.
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:41.560]  So, they, like Joe, Battister, and many many others,
[3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:45.320]  they write their congressmen, they write the IRS, they ask them to answer these
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:49.480]  questions, help them understand, they get no response. So, as free Americans, they
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:53.080]  act on their beliefs. As individuals, they act on their beliefs. Then, of course,
[3:37:53.080 --> 3:37:57.560]  the government comes down and with a ton of like a ton of bricks, it
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:38:03.320]  just takes the legs right off from under them and turns their lives upside down.
[3:38:03.320 --> 3:38:07.240]  And many cases, you have some suicides, you have
[3:38:07.240 --> 3:38:11.480]  you have homes, families completely destroyed,
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:14.520]  simply because the government will not answer questions. Yeah, there's no new
[3:38:14.520 --> 3:38:18.280]  process either. These aren't regular courts. Same with family courts. It's just
[3:38:18.280 --> 3:38:22.280]  this criminal system they've set up in the last 90 years.
[3:38:22.280 --> 3:38:25.480]  Yeah, and so, you know, we learned from all of this,
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:30.680]  Alex, that individuals and small groups cannot prevail.
[3:38:30.680 --> 3:38:35.160]  This guy, Mahatma Gandhi, that brought India out from under British rule,
[3:38:35.160 --> 3:38:38.920]  he said correctly that when the people are up against unjust and
[3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:43.400]  uncivil government and laws, and they are entitled to reform as we are,
[3:38:43.400 --> 3:38:46.600]  they'll get it only if they follow a three-part formula. He said, if you're
[3:38:46.600 --> 3:38:50.120]  missing any one of the three parts, you're going to fail. You need to be proactive,
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:53.880]  nonviolent, and you need a mass movement. You need a critical mass.
[3:38:53.880 --> 3:38:56.920]  Of course, there was this fellow, Martin Luther King,
[3:38:56.920 --> 3:39:02.680]  who wrote Jr., who wrote a piece in 1953 about Gandhi and this formula, and he
[3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:05.640]  said, that's the formula I'm going to follow, and he was able to
[3:39:05.640 --> 3:39:09.160]  apply it successfully, proactive, nonviolent,
[3:39:09.160 --> 3:39:14.360]  mass movement. And so, we've exhausted this foundation with the assistance of
[3:39:14.360 --> 3:39:17.560]  tens of thousands of people across the country for 10 years.
[3:39:17.560 --> 3:39:23.560]  We have established a solid record of petitioning, you know, identifying with
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:27.080]  facts these violations of all of these provisions of the Constitution, whether
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:30.600]  it's the war powers clauses, the money clauses, the tax clauses,
[3:39:30.600 --> 3:39:36.760]  the privacy clauses, and so forth. We have laid out with the assistance
[3:39:36.760 --> 3:39:40.120]  of constitutional scholars like Ed Vier and Walker Todd and others,
[3:39:40.120 --> 3:39:46.200]  we've documented these violations, and we have petitioned the government
[3:39:46.200 --> 3:39:49.560]  under the First Amendment last 10 words, the petition clause, the accountability
[3:39:49.560 --> 3:39:53.240]  clause. The founders put those 10 words there.
[3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:56.840]  Knowing that this day would come, knowing that people in government
[3:39:56.840 --> 3:40:00.360]  will have a natural tendency to step outside the boundaries that we, the
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:04.920]  people, have drawn around their power. And so, they have given us, right there in
[3:40:04.920 --> 3:40:08.120]  the document, the last 10 words of the accountability clause, the right to
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:11.560]  petition for redress of grievances, and under those last, at the meaning of
[3:40:11.560 --> 3:40:14.360]  those last 10 words, is if we have some evidence that
[3:40:14.360 --> 3:40:17.160]  government has violated the Constitution, we can call them on it.
[3:40:17.160 --> 3:40:21.000]  We can petition for a remedy. They are obligated to respond.
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:25.240]  If they do not respond, then we have a government that in effect has
[3:40:25.240 --> 3:40:28.520]  turned its back on the Constitution. We've called them on it, the servant
[3:40:28.520 --> 3:40:32.840]  government. They refuse to respond, then we have the right to withdraw our
[3:40:32.840 --> 3:40:36.680]  money and our resources and our support from that government. But of course, as
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:41.160]  individuals in small groups, you know, you can't prevail, so we need a mass
[3:40:41.160 --> 3:40:44.280]  movement. We've exhausted, with this record that we've
[3:40:44.280 --> 3:40:47.160]  established, we have exhausted our administrative remedies.
[3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:51.880]  We've exhausted our judicial remedies. It's now time to take a page out of the
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:55.240]  Founder's Playbook. They found themselves in the exact same
[3:40:55.240 --> 3:41:00.200]  situation that we're now in. In 1774, two years before they signed
[3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.480]  the Declaration of Independence, they had petitioned their government,
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:07.240]  a government that was the strongest, most powerful government on the face of the
[3:41:07.240 --> 3:41:09.320]  earth. They ruled the seas. They had a huge standing
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:11.880]  army here after the French were defeated and the
[3:41:11.880 --> 3:41:14.600]  French didn't anymore. And they started treating the people in our
[3:41:14.600 --> 3:41:17.640]  colonies differently from the way they were treating their people back in
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:20.760]  Great Britain. And we, the Founders, they started to
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:24.360]  petition for a redress of these grievances and they petitioned for 11
[3:41:24.360 --> 3:41:27.080]  years. And as the Declaration of Independence says,
[3:41:27.080 --> 3:41:30.840]  and our petitions were repeated petitions were answered only with
[3:41:30.840 --> 3:41:34.600]  repeated injury. And so what did they do? They decided to get
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:37.080]  together two or three of their number from each of the
[3:41:37.080 --> 3:41:40.840]  houses. And let me just add, let me just interrupt you because the more they said,
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:43.880]  hey you're corrupt, hey you're stealing property, hey you're taxing us,
[3:41:43.880 --> 3:41:47.800]  you're acting like thugs, you got militarized police,
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:52.280]  the Crown, King George III would only beef up the number.
[3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:55.240]  Same thing happening, but now it's even worse than the British.
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:41:58.120]  The British at least weren't looting their own country.
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:42:01.800]  Now the elite are just stealing everything. It's gone to a new level of
[3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:05.080]  corruption where now the foreign bankers have imploded everything and have
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:08.600]  stolen 12 trillion in the last six months and are just
[3:42:08.600 --> 3:42:12.520]  destroying and they're just stealing it all and running offshore.
[3:42:12.520 --> 3:42:16.360]  So now it's even worse. Yes, the grievances we're suffering are,
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:21.000]  as you say, much worse, okay? But we need to do what they did.
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:26.600]  The solution here is to have a continental Congress as they did. They
[3:42:26.600 --> 3:42:29.640]  decided, look, we're going to get together in Philadelphia.
[3:42:29.640 --> 3:42:33.720]  We're going to talk about these grievances and settle on some course of action.
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:36.760]  Alex, they did not, as you know, they did not go there
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:40.680]  to sign a Declaration of Independence. They did not go there to separate. Maybe
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:44.360]  an exception, maybe Sam Adams. They have had that in mind when they
[3:42:44.360 --> 3:42:47.160]  went there, but that's not why the rest of them went.
[3:42:47.160 --> 3:42:50.920]  They went there merely to talk about these grievances and to discuss
[3:42:50.920 --> 3:42:54.280]  what they might be able to do as a free people
[3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:59.240]  to defend their rights. Their rights were being violated.
[3:42:59.240 --> 3:43:02.840]  And of course, they convened in September of 74
[3:43:02.840 --> 3:43:06.840]  and then reconvened 75 and 76. And along the way, things really got hot and
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:09.240]  eventually they decided to separate. That's right.
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:11.800]  And that's what's happening now. That's what's happening now with the state's
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:15.880]  declaring sovereignty, the people waking up. We're in the process of being
[3:43:15.880 --> 3:43:19.160]  reasonable, saying, look, Madoff people are stealing
[3:43:19.160 --> 3:43:22.440]  everything. You've taken the pension funds and given them to derivatives. The
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:24.440]  government stole the government pension funds.
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:29.880]  Boston Globe today. Look, you're criminals. You need to stop. You need to stop.
[3:43:29.880 --> 3:43:34.040]  Go ahead. Alex, the Constitution does, as you know, it doesn't defend itself. It
[3:43:34.040 --> 3:43:36.920]  just lies on your desk. The government isn't going to defend it.
[3:43:36.920 --> 3:43:40.680]  We can't rely on the state to get us out of the mess. No, it's a animating
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:46.920]  contest. Yeah. And so the Constitution's going to be
[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:50.840]  be defended only if the people defend it. The first step
[3:43:50.840 --> 3:43:54.920]  is to get a few of our number, a few people with a proven passion for the
[3:43:54.920 --> 3:43:58.920]  Constitution. Three would do. Three from each state
[3:43:58.920 --> 3:44:02.200]  with a proven passion for the Constitution. People of good character,
[3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:05.080]  people respected in the communities and so forth,
[3:44:05.080 --> 3:44:08.920]  as authors, scholars, activists and so forth, get them together.
[3:44:08.920 --> 3:44:15.800]  150 of us meeting every day at a continental Congress,
[3:44:15.800 --> 3:44:19.080]  not to be confused with a constitutional convention. They're entirely
[3:44:19.080 --> 3:44:22.440]  different. But every day, the cause of America is still the
[3:44:22.440 --> 3:44:26.440]  cause of the world. The lamp of liberty was lit here, nowhere else.
[3:44:26.440 --> 3:44:30.360]  There's great interest around the world in preserving
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:36.360]  this constitutional republic that we've been blessed with.
[3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:40.920]  And so let's get these people together. Let's have them every day
[3:44:40.920 --> 3:44:46.120]  with facts, no opinions, facts. These are the prohibitions. These are the
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:49.640]  restrictions. These are the mandates. Well, I think it's a great idea.
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:53.320]  But you can only have 150 and not all the kooks and infiltrators
[3:44:53.320 --> 3:44:56.040]  or because they'll come in and try to stir up trouble. I think you need to get Ron
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:44:58.120]  Paul. You need to get some of these leading state
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:45:03.080]  reps that have been calling. Exactly. All the leaders, including
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:06.600]  yourself, Alex, this is an invitation to you. All of the leaders
[3:45:06.600 --> 3:45:10.680]  of these constitution-based liberty and freedom-oriented organizations need to
[3:45:10.680 --> 3:45:14.680]  come together. I've just reserved and paid for 11 rooms
[3:45:14.680 --> 3:45:19.960]  at Jekyll Island for March, I'm sorry, May 13th.
[3:45:19.960 --> 3:45:24.040]  Judy and I are getting on a train in New Jersey and we're taking that train down
[3:45:24.040 --> 3:45:26.440]  to Jessup, Georgia. We're taking a ride over to
[3:45:26.440 --> 3:45:29.880]  Jekyll Island where we will spend all day
[3:45:29.880 --> 3:45:33.480]  Wednesday and Thursday and then take the train back. I've already called
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:37.240]  Ed Griffin. He says it's a great idea. I'll get on the train. I've called it
[3:45:37.240 --> 3:45:41.800]  Ed Viera. He said it's a great idea. And again, this can be a prototype. I didn't
[3:45:41.800 --> 3:45:45.160]  know you were going to announce this on the air and I'll certainly come.
[3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:48.440]  It can be a prototype for even bigger ones in the future
[3:45:48.440 --> 3:45:51.640]  and then to have others mimic it, to have a national debate
[3:45:51.640 --> 3:45:55.080]  of the people through a Declaration of Independence to
[3:45:55.080 --> 3:45:58.840]  lay out the swarms of bureaucrats eating out our
[3:45:58.840 --> 3:46:03.000]  substance, the quartered troops among us, the usurpations, the
[3:46:03.000 --> 3:46:07.160]  having legislatures erected in faraway lands,
[3:46:07.160 --> 3:46:11.480]  global government. You got it, Alex. The idea is to bring these leaders
[3:46:11.480 --> 3:46:16.200]  together to lay out the groundwork, help
[3:46:16.200 --> 3:46:19.480]  prepare the groundwork for, do the groundwork for,
[3:46:19.480 --> 3:46:22.920]  a Continental Congress, the Continental Congress where you have
[3:46:22.920 --> 3:46:25.880]  people with a proven passion for the Constitution
[3:46:25.880 --> 3:46:29.560]  getting together every day with a worldwide webcast.
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:33.000]  So every day their deliberations, their discussions, their debates, and then
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:36.920]  essentially, eventually their decision-making process
[3:46:36.920 --> 3:46:40.920]  is webcast around the world and everything uttered in that room
[3:46:40.920 --> 3:46:45.400]  is recorded. A written transcript is prepared by stenographers. We'll pay
[3:46:45.400 --> 3:46:50.040]  for all of that, okay? But we cannot...
[3:46:50.040 --> 3:46:53.880]  it's going to be up to the people in the states to
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:46:57.880]  nominate and choose the three people that they want to go off
[3:46:57.880 --> 3:47:02.120]  to participate in this upcoming Continental Congress.
[3:47:02.120 --> 3:47:06.280]  We can't get the mass movement. All we can do is set up 50
[3:47:06.280 --> 3:47:09.000]  state websites and have all of the information about the Continental
[3:47:09.000 --> 3:47:12.360]  Congress, what it is, why it was convened, what the issues are,
[3:47:12.360 --> 3:47:15.320]  and the progress, you know, all the news coming out of the Continental Congress.
[3:47:15.320 --> 3:47:20.920]  That was state legislator leaders and others who, you know, would just be
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:24.760]  nominated by their own, you know, their own legislature to be sent to the
[3:47:24.760 --> 3:47:27.800]  original one. I...
[3:47:27.800 --> 3:47:31.720]  But today, Alex, I think you would admit the states
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:37.000]  are inextricably intertwined. No, no, but let me just add, the caliber...
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:41.480]  Bob, the caliber of the founding fathers, inventors, scientists, genius level
[3:47:41.480 --> 3:47:44.920]  people, they really were the writings. I'm a pretty smart guy and I have
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:47.800]  trouble, you know, even reading some of it. I have to really digest it.
[3:47:47.800 --> 3:47:50.200]  My whole deal is that's what always happens, is these guys who know how to
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:53.880]  work together, these were a great caliber. You're a great caliber.
[3:47:53.880 --> 3:47:58.120]  So were you, and so was I. I mean, can you imagine the squabbling and arguing
[3:47:58.120 --> 3:48:00.360]  about who would go to that in the power trip of it?
[3:48:00.360 --> 3:48:05.160]  So, you know, the only issue about it, I mean, how would a state nominate
[3:48:05.160 --> 3:48:08.280]  somebody to send them then, if it's not through the legislature? All right, look,
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:12.760]  here's the procedure, and on our website there is a link for the procedure.
[3:48:12.760 --> 3:48:16.040]  We get people, first of all, we say that the people
[3:48:16.040 --> 3:48:22.760]  that are to be nominated and chosen are people of, with a proven passion for
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:25.880]  the constitution, right? So we get all these nominations, we get all of these,
[3:48:25.880 --> 3:48:29.960]  you know, the full spectrum. We then, we are hiring a company,
[3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:34.280]  we pay 30 bucks a piece to find out if that person is who they say they are.
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:39.160]  That's all we do. Then we turn it over to the leaders of these
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:42.840]  Liberty-oriented groups in the states to complete the vetting process.
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:48.120]  Then those names get placed on the state website, and then by affidavit,
[3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:51.800]  you know, paper ballots, hand mark, hand counted, people cast their votes
[3:48:51.800 --> 3:48:56.280]  based on the nominees that are on that page. And the people in the states,
[3:48:56.280 --> 3:48:59.320]  the people in the freedom movement, they know who these people are,
[3:48:59.320 --> 3:49:04.200]  and these state coordinators and their assistants and so forth, we know
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:09.480]  who they are, Alex. And they decide who they're going to put
[3:49:09.480 --> 3:49:14.040]  on the state website. Good. We're all supported. I wish you guys luck.
[3:49:14.040 --> 3:49:17.160]  It sounds good. We need more stuff like this.
[3:49:17.160 --> 3:49:20.120]  So, you know what? I'll have you back on next week or something to talk more about
[3:49:20.120 --> 3:49:23.080]  because we're almost out of time. But this is, you know, just this is a
[3:49:23.080 --> 3:49:27.160]  process, the evolution, the development of the Second American Revolution we hope
[3:49:27.160 --> 3:49:32.440]  to carry out in a freedom-oriented manner. Overall, Bob, go ahead. Alex,
[3:49:32.440 --> 3:49:37.320]  mark your calendar. The train leaves on the 12th from New Jersey.
[3:49:37.320 --> 3:49:40.440]  Of course, it stops in D.C. and Richmond and so forth.
[3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:45.240]  I'll put out an article. I forget the train number. I think it's number 97.
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:48.840]  But anyway, it gets down there. It's an overnight trip. Judy and I have
[3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:55.240]  reserved a sleeper car. We arrived there on the morning of the 13th,
[3:49:55.240 --> 3:49:58.600]  Wednesday, where they're all day and all day Thursday, and then we take the
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:50:03.640]  train back. So, put on your calendar, make that trip with us, and Ed Viera,
[3:50:03.640 --> 3:50:06.440]  Ed Griffin, all of these other folks are agreeing to make that train ride.
[3:50:06.440 --> 3:50:11.240]  Join us, please, and we'll lay the groundwork. We'll deal with issues like
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:17.480]  you're raising, you know, how best to choose these people who will be the
[3:50:17.480 --> 3:50:20.680]  delegates. So, this is a preliminary planning meeting to then launch that.
[3:50:20.680 --> 3:50:24.120]  Oh, sure. Well, that sounds like some great footage anyway, so I'd like to bring
[3:50:24.120 --> 3:50:30.120]  my cameras in. The new Obama film is going to be done by mid-May, though,
[3:50:30.120 --> 3:50:33.240]  and then I got to send it off to Mass Produce for July 4th. But regardless,
[3:50:33.240 --> 3:50:36.360]  I could put that in another film, because that's important to get the
[3:50:36.360 --> 3:50:39.560]  message out. That's our committee's correspondence. We've got to start pushing
[3:50:39.560 --> 3:50:43.320]  back, Alex. The people have to push back, and they have to do it by the
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:46.760]  numbers. Without that critical mass or mass movement, you know...
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:49.720]  I agree with you. I had no idea. I just said a week ago, hey, set
[3:50:49.720 --> 3:50:52.920]  Bob Schultz, I haven't talked to him in a while, and you've gotten a lot done,
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:50:55.640]  so I'm very excited. I'd like to be involved with it and promote it and
[3:50:55.640 --> 3:50:58.760]  everything here on the radio, so that's very exciting. We'll come back with a
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:51:01.560]  final segment with our guest. Stay with us.
[3:51:01.560 --> 3:51:04.840]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly
[3:51:04.840 --> 3:51:08.920]  disappearing like magic, thanks to Can-See. The original Can-See eye drop
[3:51:08.920 --> 3:51:13.160]  used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula
[3:51:13.160 --> 3:51:16.760]  is effective in reducing, reversing, and slowing the occurrence of senile
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:19.240]  cataract. Can-See can also assist in lowering the
[3:51:19.240 --> 3:51:23.080]  intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Can-See is beneficial for
[3:51:23.080 --> 3:51:26.200]  contact lens disorders to treat corneal disorders, combat
[3:51:26.200 --> 3:51:29.720]  eye strain, kidneys, computer vision syndrome, and more. People enjoying the
[3:51:29.720 --> 3:51:33.640]  benefits while using Can-See report no side effects, and the drops are gentle
[3:51:33.640 --> 3:51:37.160]  and don't cause eye burning. With regular use, people using Can-See drops
[3:51:37.160 --> 3:51:40.520]  report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days, and some have their
[3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:45.320]  cataracts completely disappear within months. Can-See, that's Can-Letter C,
[3:51:45.320 --> 3:51:51.400]  is available now by calling 888-212-8871. That's 888-212-8871, or
[3:51:51.400 --> 3:51:55.800]  order online at Nutramedical.com. That's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com,
[3:51:55.800 --> 3:51:59.320]  your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols
[3:51:59.320 --> 3:52:05.240]  from a doctor you can trust. In the New World Order's war against humanity,
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:09.720]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got to give them a stake
[3:52:09.720 --> 3:52:13.960]  in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:17.240]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:20.440]  that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[3:52:20.440 --> 3:52:24.920]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.920 --> 3:52:28.600]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:52:28.600 --> 3:52:34.200]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance
[3:52:34.200 --> 3:52:38.040]  oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.040 --> 3:52:41.640]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:46.600]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told,
[3:52:46.600 --> 3:52:51.240]  and his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today

[3:53:01.240 --> 3:53:05.960]  What I'm about to read is not intended to scare you, but the LA Times just reported
[3:53:05.960 --> 3:53:09.400]  that unemployment will exceed record 1945 levels.
[3:53:09.400 --> 3:53:12.600]  Millions are about to find themselves out of work. Will you?
[3:53:12.600 --> 3:53:17.800]  Look, I say this not to scare you, but to empower and motivate you to make a choice.
[3:53:17.800 --> 3:53:21.480]  You can sit around waiting for the worst to happen or you can go to

[3:54:01.240 --> 3:54:08.920]  You know, I said I'd take some of your calls. We did in the last hour
[3:54:08.920 --> 3:54:11.880]  into this hour, but we're not going to be able to. So everybody call back tomorrow
[3:54:11.880 --> 3:54:14.280]  and we'll get to you. Take a lot of calls coming up the next
[3:54:14.280 --> 3:54:17.240]  few days. It's just that this is too important with what Bob Schultz is talking
[3:54:17.240 --> 3:54:19.560]  about. Spirit of Liberty is everywhere. Sons of
[3:54:19.560 --> 3:54:22.920]  Liberty, daughters of Liberty, a rise to Fender Republic.
[3:54:22.920 --> 3:54:26.360]  They're openly announcing world government, openly announcing the foreign banks
[3:54:26.360 --> 3:54:29.640]  have stolen all the money. I mean, Boston Globe where they're stealing the
[3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:34.360]  pension funds, the government's giving the pension funds to the
[3:54:34.360 --> 3:54:39.240]  derivatives houses. I mean, this level of criminality even shocks me. These people
[3:54:39.240 --> 3:54:42.360]  are so bold. Bob Schultz, We The People Foundation, give out the
[3:54:42.360 --> 3:54:48.120]  website for folks that want to visit it. WeThePeopleCongress.org.
[3:54:48.120 --> 3:54:54.280]  WeThePeopleCongress.org. We have that up on the TV screen right now
[3:54:54.280 --> 3:54:57.800]  as we somalcast at prisonplanet.tv. We'll definitely have you back up as
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:55:00.760]  it develops and I'll probably take your invitation to that. I'm just so
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:04.520]  tied down here with work and the Info War trying to just awaken the
[3:55:04.520 --> 3:55:07.480]  minds out there, set the fires of Liberty that
[3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:13.240]  grow into huge infernos. But specifically, does it even shock you being
[3:55:13.240 --> 3:55:16.600]  from business to just see the lawlessness that's going on?
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:21.160]  It's unprecedented. It's dumb-founding that this could go on
[3:55:21.160 --> 3:55:25.400]  simply because 65 million people vote for somebody
[3:55:25.400 --> 3:55:29.160]  that we can't overturn the will of the voters.
[3:55:29.160 --> 3:55:33.320]  The Constitution means nothing. Sorry, but that Constitution
[3:55:33.320 --> 3:55:36.600]  is the supreme law of the land. The problem is it doesn't defend itself.
[3:55:36.600 --> 3:55:40.680]  We've got to do that. The record is clear, Alex. For 10 years now, we've been
[3:55:40.680 --> 3:55:43.480]  establishing this record with the assistance of tens of thousands of
[3:55:43.480 --> 3:55:47.000]  people around the country. We have petitioned, we have documented
[3:55:47.000 --> 3:55:50.200]  these violations as you have, but we've documented these
[3:55:50.200 --> 3:55:54.200]  violations of the various provisions, restrictions,
[3:55:54.200 --> 3:55:58.600]  mandates of the Constitution. But importantly, we have petitioned with
[3:55:58.600 --> 3:56:02.200]  the assistance of constitutional scholars, professionally, intelligently,
[3:56:02.200 --> 3:56:06.280]  rationally, laid it out, served them all, and
[3:56:06.280 --> 3:56:10.200]  our repeated petitions are being answered only with repeated injury.
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:14.040]  And so, the question is, what's the appropriate next step for a free
[3:56:14.040 --> 3:56:16.920]  people to take? Just as the founders had a record
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:21.160]  of petitioning for 11 years, we have this solid record
[3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:24.760]  of petitioning for redress, and our petitions are being answered.
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:28.920]  And to dream is destiny. We have to know this is our course. I mean, we have right
[3:56:28.920 --> 3:56:32.440]  on our side, the people are waking up, the corruption is evident, just like a
[3:56:32.440 --> 3:56:36.280]  declaration of independent states. This is another great solution,
[3:56:36.280 --> 3:56:39.720]  and I commend you with the work that you're doing.
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:44.200]  Thanks, Alex. Look forward to working with you. No, you bet. I look forward to
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:46.600]  and I'm just glad I thought to get you on. I didn't even know you were planning this.
[3:56:46.600 --> 3:56:49.800]  I know you're always out there doing such great work. You know, overall, discrediting
[3:56:49.800 --> 3:56:53.320]  the IRS is a criminal group and paying for the
[3:56:53.320 --> 3:56:55.880]  interest on the debt, as Ronald Reagan's commission showed. I mean,
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:56:59.320]  that's now widely known, and the fact that a lot of government people aren't
[3:56:59.320 --> 3:57:03.560]  paying taxes, that's now widely known. So, the establishment is just upping
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:06.120]  their looting and just saying, we don't care. We
[3:57:06.120 --> 3:57:09.400]  telling Congress if they don't do what the executive says, they'll declare
[3:57:09.400 --> 3:57:12.920]  martial law, and that's mainstream news, and I have congressmen on the show
[3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:16.520]  who've been threatened. I mean, this is la-la land that's going on. We had in the
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:19.400]  Fed protest around the country, we got the secret army documents, called them, and
[3:57:19.400 --> 3:57:23.640]  they confirmed it, that the army intelligence is spying on us. I mean,
[3:57:23.640 --> 3:57:28.760]  army, Pentagon, you work for the bankers. We're the good guys.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:31.960]  And we have an accountability clause. We could hold them accountable.
[3:57:31.960 --> 3:57:35.960]  We can do it constitutionally and legally. We just have to do it by the
[3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:39.640]  book, and we have to be make sure that the
[3:57:39.640 --> 3:57:42.520]  sympathies of people around the country and around the world
[3:57:42.520 --> 3:57:46.680]  go to us, not the government. You know, we have to connect the dots
[3:57:46.680 --> 3:57:50.920]  in the minds of many people, Alex, and that's what the Continental Congress
[3:57:50.920 --> 3:57:55.400]  will do. Every day, we will go through these violations with facts. Every day,
[3:57:55.400 --> 3:57:58.360]  we will go through these attempts to hold the government accountable,
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:58:01.720]  and every day with facts, we will show that the government
[3:58:01.720 --> 3:58:07.080]  simply refuses, absolutely refuses, to be held accountable. Refuses to justify-
[3:58:07.080 --> 3:58:10.760]  All right, very, very exciting, completely wrong government.
[3:58:10.760 --> 3:58:15.240]  Bob Schultz with the people of congress.org will talk to you soon. Very
[3:58:15.240 --> 3:58:18.840]  exciting. Godspeed, my friend. Stay well, Alex. Stay well.
[3:58:18.840 --> 3:58:21.880]  Thank you so much for spending time with us. So that's it for this transmission.
[3:58:21.880 --> 3:58:26.360]  A huge, packed, very informative show from pillar to post.
[3:58:26.360 --> 3:58:30.040]  It restarts on the internet streams, one place, my websites,
[3:58:30.040 --> 3:58:33.080]  infowars.com and prismplanet.com, Ensemblecast
[3:58:33.080 --> 3:58:36.600]  at prismplanet.tv, one place on the web. All over,
[3:58:36.600 --> 3:58:40.040]  MNFM's will be rearing us. God bless you. Spread the word about the show.

[3:58:51.480 --> 3:58:55.160]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[3:58:55.160 --> 3:58:57.960]  to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[3:58:57.960 --> 3:59:00.920]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[3:59:00.920 --> 3:59:03.960]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[3:59:03.960 --> 3:59:07.320]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your
[3:59:07.320 --> 3:59:10.200]  family. In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no
[3:59:10.200 --> 3:59:13.240]  one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[3:59:13.240 --> 3:59:17.000]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from
[3:59:17.000 --> 3:59:20.280]  E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports,
[3:59:20.280 --> 3:59:23.560]  and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
