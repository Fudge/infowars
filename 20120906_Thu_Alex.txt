[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:37.680]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:37.680 --> 00:43.680]  ladies and gentlemen this is going to be an absolutely jam-packed marathon
[00:43.680 --> 00:50.560]  transmission today of overwhelming importance we are so jam-packed today
[00:50.560 --> 00:56.040]  first off more and more top computer scientists and the real inventors of the
[00:56.040 --> 01:00.960]  internet have been signing letters in the last year saying that the military
[01:00.960 --> 01:04.960]  industrial complex and corporations are trying to take the web over and are
[01:04.960 --> 01:10.560]  surveilling everyone illegally so there is a mass revolt against the NSA in
[01:10.560 --> 01:19.720]  cutel type controlled systems info poll 9 in Europe and the British system as
[01:19.720 --> 01:25.400]  well there is a mass awakening within the top scientists themselves that we're
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.520]  going into serious tyranny and that major Western corporations are helping
[01:29.520 --> 01:34.480]  Russia and China censor their own web and trying to bring that here under the
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.720]  cyber security legislation Sir Tim Berners Lee has accused the government of
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.040]  draconian internet snooping one in Telegraph he hasn't accused anybody it's
[01:46.040 --> 01:52.480]  like saying he claims this son came up this morning no we all know it came up
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.600]  this morning okay I try to teach in schools now to never be decisive never
[01:56.600 --> 02:00.760]  have a view never say you know they're in the fish tank which which fish is the
[02:00.760 --> 02:04.240]  largest gee I don't know I mean I run into these people with college degrees
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.400]  I think it's cool that they're indecisive it's admitted there are scores of NSA
[02:09.400 --> 02:13.880]  whistleblowers that have gone public and said they're listening to everything
[02:13.880 --> 02:16.840]  you're doing but it's in the telecommunications acts it's in the
[02:16.840 --> 02:20.520]  telecommunication acts in Europe everything's got snooping hubs wired in
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.080]  it's not denied in fact they kind of want you to know they're doing it to scare
[02:25.080 --> 02:29.480]  you to make you shut up politically like you've done something bad but on the
[02:29.480 --> 02:32.800]  other side then when it comes out it's illegal they go oh we're not we're not
[02:32.800 --> 02:35.960]  doing that it's kind of like bush saying tortures good we're taking the gloves
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.920]  off yeah I ordered torture but oh that's a felony oh well I didn't order it
[02:40.920 --> 02:44.720]  send the people to prison but then later writes a book bragging he ordered it so
[02:44.720 --> 02:50.800]  they play this this game of criminality with everybody now NSA is huge news right
[02:50.800 --> 02:57.120]  now I am gonna announce here on air a nationwide protest of the criminal
[02:57.120 --> 03:03.680]  illegal national security state that works for foreign banks I had the idea
[03:03.680 --> 03:06.960]  yesterday I'm gonna codify the next few days and we're just gonna have media
[03:06.960 --> 03:10.720]  protests we're gonna have protest outside these locations where they try to
[03:10.720 --> 03:14.760]  lie and say you can't film us you can go on Google Earth and see it it's the idea
[03:14.760 --> 03:18.440]  of you have no rights you have no rights and they're using the NSA to spy on
[03:18.440 --> 03:22.360]  journalist the spy on Congress they're using it to go after whistleblowers that
[03:22.360 --> 03:27.600]  expose corruption this has become a very evil organization and their own
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.200]  employees are coming out and saying this we need to stand with the good people
[03:32.200 --> 03:36.120]  who are in the NSA you know this thing starts with well let's spy on the
[03:36.120 --> 03:39.640]  Russians but of course it ends up being turned against the people domestically
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.440]  just like you don't want your military used domestically now they say that's
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.480]  anti-military if you don't want the military operating domestically no
[03:46.480 --> 03:52.000]  that's called not living in North Korea or Venezuela or communist China it's
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.640]  called living in a free country and the prosperity comes with the liberty so
[03:55.640 --> 03:59.280]  we're gonna defend it I will be protesting and standing up and we're
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.680]  gonna have a day where we all write articles about the NSA everybody does
[04:02.680 --> 04:07.760]  YouTube's about it which is an NSA platform on record now and where we
[04:07.760 --> 04:11.440]  also have phone conversations with each other and acknowledge that the NSA
[04:11.440 --> 04:15.280]  computers are listening and I'll give you a spectrum of keywords not the ones
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.360]  you think like bomb or drugs no it's gonna be I have the new super
[04:19.360 --> 04:23.160]  processor yes we're rolling it out it's gonna be stuff like that I'm gonna
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.200]  teach you how to show them we know they're listening and we're and we're
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.960]  not intimidated because you know why the NSA is now calling people here at the
[04:32.960 --> 04:37.840]  office yes you heard me phone number comes up we even have it on the smart
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.760]  phone showing you'll call for you call the number it's the NSA so now the NSA
[04:42.760 --> 04:46.440]  is calling us a standard thing they do they used to do that to me a long time
[04:46.440 --> 04:49.320]  ago when that doesn't scare you they call up and tell you what you were just
[04:49.320 --> 04:54.640]  talking about to try to freak you out and so we're gonna have Russell Doudin

[11:11.160 --> 11:18.000]  gotten six seven times over the years the NSA phone call where it's the NSA

[11:25.320 --> 11:28.840]  call back on the caller ID if it's a landline or your cell phone and it's
[11:28.840 --> 11:33.920]  national security agency may I help you then you don't believe it's the NSA and
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.640]  you go online and check the phone number and it's the NSA that the head guy in
[11:39.640 --> 11:46.280]  there over my newspaper and the six people back there got that call and so
[11:46.280 --> 11:49.400]  we're going to show you a screenshot of his phone we're going to show you the

[11:56.080 --> 12:01.760]  calling us now again if that doesn't scare you then they start calling up and
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.800]  saying hey just heard you talking to your mom yeah I hope she dies in the
[12:05.800 --> 12:11.680]  hospital so they want to scare you next like oh you didn't get the hint we're

[12:18.080 --> 12:22.160]  state no no we're not running and hiding you're gonna run and hide you're gonna
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.160]  run and hide criminals you understand that oh you think you're intimidating us

[12:34.320 --> 12:39.680]  public the police in LA are saying it's terrorism to film anywhere basically and
[12:39.680 --> 12:43.640]  are arresting people well they're getting out later the point is is that they
[12:43.640 --> 12:47.600]  want to start snatching us off the streets they want to get a North Korea
[12:47.600 --> 12:52.440]  going they want to get a cell chest you going they're hungry for it that's the
[12:52.440 --> 12:59.440]  big preparation so that is coming up Tyrell Ventura will be joining us for
[12:59.440 --> 13:02.680]  about 10 minutes because I got the good news a few days ago but he can announce
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.360]  it now his father's coming on next week the former governor Jesse Ventura the
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.520]  show the third season that was shot last year that I'm in that is real reality
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.360]  TV let me tell you we're out there on the streets I mean there's no blow-ups
[13:15.360 --> 13:20.720]  with David Ike I mean it it it's it's most reality TV is not reality TV that
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.840]  they don't really even call this reality TV but it is it's strange but the point
[13:24.840 --> 13:30.800]  is that that is going to air now coming up right after the election first
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.480]  episode Wednesday night's what November 7th so Tyrell will be popping in about
[13:36.480 --> 13:41.400]  that we also have a mother on who runs the website free range kids all over the

[13:46.200 --> 13:49.320]  yard or running around like we all did you know in the neighborhood remember
[13:49.320 --> 13:53.640]  they're saying 12 year old should be inside you know drinking aspartame
[13:53.640 --> 13:57.000]  eating GMO and watching brainwashing television or you're not a good
[13:57.000 --> 14:04.960]  globalist and then we have Steve and Andrea Hernandez they have made big
[14:04.960 --> 14:11.160]  national news fighting the slave necklaces that they wear at San Antonio
[14:11.160 --> 14:15.180]  schools their department defense run they also have AI computers watching
[14:15.180 --> 14:19.000]  with children eat their food to track with their calorie intake I mean it's a
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.280]  total high-tech prison grid Bill Gates is coming out with bracelets that you
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.240]  wear that track your heartbeat and if you're focused just the total prisoner
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.360]  sci-fi training conditioning the next generation for strip searches everything
[14:30.360 --> 14:33.320]  else they're fighting back against that because I guess they're not good
[14:33.320 --> 14:39.960]  globalist so that is what we have lined up for you today here on the good old
[14:39.960 --> 14:45.040]  Alex Jones show or what I call info wars live I wanted to call the show back
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.120]  when it got syndicated in 1997 when we began getting on a few stations I want
[14:49.120 --> 14:53.040]  to call it info wars and I think Genesis folks Ted Anderson at the time
[14:53.040 --> 14:56.440]  Michael Trudeau is working there good guy we're right when they said you know

[15:04.320 --> 15:07.120]  call it the Alex Jones show which I always thought was a bit pretentious but
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.800]  it is the Alex Jones show official officially we call the video stream of
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.680]  it that's at prison planet on TV info wars live because this is the live TV
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.920]  slash radio show it's really radio slash TV about 98% of the audience is
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.520]  radio but it tends to all be geared towards visual so that we can show you

[17:17.760 --> 17:22.640]  that we link to it's only 174,000 rounds and it's for social security

[17:36.240 --> 17:41.320]  just you know they said so so all of that's going on well well you and the
[17:41.320 --> 17:45.000]  Dean just said they need this ammo and that you know the hollow and then
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.240]  others in the article said the hollow points are quite normal that's what you
[17:47.240 --> 17:51.240]  use for shooting target I mean anybody knows guns knows that's not true but so
[17:51.240 --> 17:58.160]  what they're illegal to use in war but continuing other Geneva convention but

[18:07.040 --> 18:12.720]  civil unrest it's it's 174,000 rounds of ammo just just missing everything else
[18:12.720 --> 18:16.800]  in the article the 1.4 billion that's why people are upset but they make it
[18:16.800 --> 18:21.400]  about 174,000 same thing with the drones we're like they're using drones to
[18:21.400 --> 18:24.840]  arrest people here's examples in North Dakota and in this place and that and

[35:15.720 --> 35:19.280]  yesterday saying the same thing former bureau chief for the New York Times for

[36:18.160 --> 36:21.720]  seconds ago and we predicted that would happen when the fall kicked off and it's
[36:21.720 --> 36:26.080]  beginning because now the Fed saying yeah we'll do QE3 if we need to so we
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.480]  thought we were wrong we thought what happened late last year early this year
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.520]  but they've got to do it or things will even plug more so you're darned if you
[36:33.520 --> 36:36.720]  do darned if you don't you're up the creek without a paddle either way but

[37:03.520 --> 37:07.960]  oath upon the Constitution to have that badge upon your chest start and the
[37:07.960 --> 37:11.880]  Constitution to defend the Constitution and its Republic not take orders from
[37:11.880 --> 37:16.240]  these tyrannical people Homeland Security they are sir it's on record

[37:37.920 --> 37:41.760]  right great job Dan Badandi and crew that's coming up at the bottom of the
[37:41.760 --> 37:46.360]  hour I take you now to a victory for the First Amendment with the son of Jesse
[37:46.360 --> 37:51.800]  Ventura but filmmaker TV host actor producer incredible cameraman that's
[37:51.800 --> 37:54.960]  what I really admire being on a bunch of these shoots with him is the eye that
[37:54.960 --> 37:58.640]  Tyrell Ventura has with cameras and the shots he gets I've learned a lot from
[37:58.640 --> 38:06.440]  this guy just on that front Tyrell Ventura joins us again and he is one of
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.400]  the co-producers and new host of the popular third season conspiracy theory
[38:12.400 --> 38:18.400]  also with the son a filmmaker and actor in his own right of legendary director
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.880]  Oliver Stone Sean Stone friend of the show friend of mine as well and we're
[38:23.880 --> 38:27.720]  also twisting Tyrell's arm try to get Harry Dean Stanton who I was invited to
[38:27.720 --> 38:30.480]  be in Jesse's birthday party I didn't bug him at the birthday party to come on
[38:30.480 --> 38:35.160]  but I should have because I want to get Harry Dean Stanton on the show as well
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.440]  to get his view on things that we had Christopher walking on a few weeks ago
[38:38.440 --> 38:44.160]  gotta gotta have him but going to Tyrell Ventura good news homeland security
[38:44.160 --> 38:47.920]  threatened and everything and got him to erase and not air the homeland security
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.760]  episode that I helped produce on the FEMA camps supposed to air about 50 times
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.280]  every year it aired once that raced off DVRs all sorts of harassment that I was
[38:56.280 --> 38:59.320]  told about but not at liberty to talk about people say hey we'll tell you
[38:59.320 --> 39:02.440]  this people always say hey you have these big meetings with a globalist or
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.800]  you you know you have this source tell us no one would ever give me sources again
[39:06.800 --> 39:11.040]  if I burn people someday I hope Jesse and others will tell you the stuff that
[39:11.040 --> 39:15.360]  went on but let me tell you they didn't want that they were mad about the second
[39:15.360 --> 39:19.680]  season true TV did give them the authorization to do this because Ventura
[39:19.680 --> 39:24.720]  demanded to have free reign and then pressure came in now in the third season
[39:24.720 --> 39:28.800]  they kind of took it away for eight nine months and reedited it so I'm who knows
[39:28.800 --> 39:32.400]  what's gonna come out I hope it's gonna be good but it does peak my interest it's
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.480]  gonna start airing in November right after the election and Tyrell I mean I
[39:36.480 --> 39:40.920]  think this is a victory for the First Amendment what do you say I think it's
[39:40.920 --> 39:46.680]  a wonderful day you know once again the shows November 7th 10 p.m. you know
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.080]  they're back on Wednesdays rather than Fridays we don't have to you know compete
[39:50.080 --> 39:54.200]  with people going out Friday night things like that so you know shows that
[39:54.200 --> 39:57.960]  they coming back with a lot of faith in the show and things like that and you
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.000]  know like I said once again they didn't really take it away from us for eight
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  months as much as just a lot of you know like explained the show before
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.640]  explained on your show before there was you know we have to brought in and a new
[40:10.640 --> 40:15.480]  EP and then kind of liaison between the networks so we ended up having to absolutely
[40:15.480 --> 40:18.960]  I mean I'm I mean I'm technically wrong the point is is they brought in new
[40:18.960 --> 40:24.000]  people and sat there and kind of redid it over eight nine months and so I mean
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.840]  they changed the project go ahead oh yeah yeah but but the nice thing is is you
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.000]  know I've seen the episodes that are gonna be airing and things like that
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.240]  and they look fantastic you know it's it's definitely a lie it's definitely
[40:39.240 --> 40:43.160]  gonna be a fun show this year I mean we we tackle some subjects I think that
[40:43.160 --> 40:48.360]  people aren't gonna quite expect Jesse to tackle we get into issues that he
[40:48.360 --> 40:52.880]  doesn't believe you know which is a you know which you know a lot of times in
[40:52.880 --> 40:56.320]  the shows you know we'd always kind of go forward with things that you know he
[40:56.320 --> 40:59.960]  kind of had an initial instinct to do you know something might be you know
[40:59.960 --> 41:05.200]  something might be a little wonky and Denmark there but but this year we kind
[41:05.200 --> 41:08.360]  of you know we went after some controversial issues within the
[41:08.360 --> 41:12.320]  conspiracy theory world you know we're the out there in the in the ether you
[41:12.320 --> 41:15.880]  know so it's gonna be a good season man it's wild and woolly and it's a lot of
[41:15.880 --> 41:20.360]  fun working with Sean Stone and it's gonna be a good show Tyrell I gotta tell
[41:20.360 --> 41:24.280]  you you look ultra cool on the Skype right now that I'm telling her first
[41:24.280 --> 41:28.120]  Skype appearance on your show I figured I had to gusty it up a little bit now
[41:28.120 --> 41:37.360]  no I tell you Tyrell there is so much to go over here but you kind of give us a
[41:37.360 --> 41:40.800]  little bit of a sneak peek of what's coming up your father would say hey I've
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.520]  done the research Wall Street's running scams let's go investigate you go talk
[41:44.520 --> 41:48.680]  to Wall Street insiders or we know what's happening with water what they're
[41:48.680 --> 41:53.480]  putting in the water the lithium the fluoride but also that they're gobbling
[41:53.480 --> 41:56.600]  it up and handing it over to foreign powers foreign corporations and and
[41:56.600 --> 42:00.440]  issues like that real meat and potatoes that never been on TV normally a
[42:00.440 --> 42:06.120]  conspiracy show would do the mind control of the little green men or
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.800]  chubacabras or reptoids or or you know things like that first and then never do
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.480]  the two seasons you did this time you're going out and doing some of the other
[42:16.480 --> 42:20.440]  go secret space program type stuff I mean there's a lot of really hardcore
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.000]  serious ones as well but you guys also approach the you know issues that have
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.640]  been seen as a little more out there but in a serious way most those shows I
[42:28.640 --> 42:32.920]  don't want to sit here and interview myself but talk about that well you know
[42:32.920 --> 42:36.920]  we we we decided this year that there's a lot of you know there's a lot of
[42:36.920 --> 42:40.960]  conspiracies like you say that are to the average John Q citizen a little bit
[42:40.960 --> 42:47.080]  more out there and like whoa that sounds a little nuts and so we decided to see
[42:47.080 --> 42:51.160]  what Jesse's take would be on these and so as an investigative team we started
[42:51.160 --> 42:55.640]  to go in there and seeing you know how much you know fact is within the fiction
[42:55.640 --> 43:00.040]  and how much fiction was it that was within the facts and because we felt you
[43:00.040 --> 43:04.280]  know it's a service you know we're an informational show or an entertainment
[43:04.280 --> 43:08.760]  show an informational show and we felt that it would be a good idea to to get
[43:08.760 --> 43:13.080]  in a little bit more of those out there subjects just to kind of see you know how
[43:13.080 --> 43:17.560]  much truth is there to them if there's truth we put it on the air if they're
[43:17.560 --> 43:22.480]  not truthful then we put that on the air just to show that you know we're not we
[43:22.480 --> 43:26.680]  don't always you know we don't always just push the agenda of conspiracy there
[43:26.680 --> 43:30.200]  are a lot of bogus conspiracies as much as there's real conspiracies and
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.200]  hopefully we can shed a few a little bit more light on all those this year and
[43:34.200 --> 43:38.400]  it's gonna be a hell of a season I mean it was a lot of fun to shoot it was a
[43:38.400 --> 43:43.040]  breakneck schedule and shooting and and you know I'm sorry for the delay but we
[43:43.040 --> 43:48.360]  are back on you know November 7th to 10 p.m. so it's you know tune in we finally
[43:48.360 --> 43:52.880]  made it on the air exactly let almost peaks the interest more and it's on
[43:52.880 --> 43:56.440]  Wednesday nights which in its original slot it got top ratings it still did
[43:56.440 --> 44:01.040]  very well on a Friday slot known to be the place they put things to die but
[44:01.040 --> 44:07.040]  now it's back like the Phoenix because you didn't die thank you all I thank you
[44:07.040 --> 44:10.400]  all for keeping us on you know I mean it's it's we had a hell of a second
[44:10.400 --> 44:15.200]  season and that's one of the main reasons they brought us back you know
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.920]  we're a season-to-season show so the viewership counts you know they don't
[44:18.920 --> 44:23.480]  have us slated for three more seasons after this we go season-to-season so you
[44:23.480 --> 44:27.840]  guys of support and viewership is what's important the viewer mail that they get
[44:27.840 --> 44:32.240]  things like that these are all important things to keep us on the air now
[44:32.240 --> 44:36.040]  expanding on this because I haven't seen the edits I mean I was part of some of
[44:36.040 --> 44:39.440]  the shows consulted some but I haven't seen it so I don't know but from what I
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.280]  saw you guys really go out and what you see is real and you try to discover
[44:44.280 --> 44:48.960]  what's happening but the subjects before were pretty much vetted you know is
[44:48.960 --> 44:52.800]  global warming real or is it a scam all of this and you go out and really
[44:52.800 --> 44:57.400]  interview the experts on both sides in this case you guys really didn't know
[44:57.400 --> 45:01.760]  and you truly went out to investigate you know things that you guys thought might
[45:01.760 --> 45:06.720]  be baloney and there's some confrontations here so it's not so much a debunking show
[45:06.720 --> 45:11.160]  but when you run into bull though I think there is some debunking I mean is
[45:11.160 --> 45:16.040]  that accurate it's not a debunking show at all Jesse's standard kind of rules
[45:16.040 --> 45:21.160]  and laws that he put out to us as the investigators were you bring me what is
[45:21.160 --> 45:26.320]  truth you know and and that's his rule if it whatever the truth is as best we
[45:26.320 --> 45:30.280]  can you know figure it out from the experts we talked to in the locations we
[45:30.280 --> 45:35.800]  go to you bring me back the truth no matter how crazy and weird it is so no
[45:35.800 --> 45:39.560]  it's not a debunking show we never went out saying oh we're gonna debunk this and
[45:39.560 --> 45:44.960]  we're gonna throw this out if in the process of an investigation we prove
[45:44.960 --> 45:50.240]  or we we see that you know that it just doesn't quite hold water we tell the
[45:50.240 --> 45:53.720]  truth about it doesn't quite hold water the same as if we in the process in the
[45:53.720 --> 45:58.240]  investigation if we suddenly see that wow this is actually this there's some
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.200]  there's some fire amidst the smoke here we show that you know we don't we talk
[46:02.200 --> 46:07.360]  about some of them start we don't start with an agenda we start from simply okay
[46:07.360 --> 46:11.280]  here's the experts here's the facts that are known let's go out and see if this
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.840]  is accurate and I got a hundred percent attested this being part of all three
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.960]  seasons that that you guys say let's go see what's happening on Wall Street let's
[46:20.960 --> 46:24.000]  go see what's happening with the water let's go see what's happening in area
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.160]  51 let's go investigate this and go out and do it you know my point is this is a
[46:29.160 --> 46:33.640]  little more wild some of the subjects what like half the episodes or what would
[46:33.640 --> 46:39.760]  be seen as traditionally kind of out there yeah I don't know I mean I to John
[46:39.760 --> 46:43.840]  Q citizen who's not you know awake to these sort of things all of our subjects
[46:43.840 --> 46:49.120]  are a little bit out there exactly but you know I think it I think you have to
[46:49.120 --> 46:54.160]  you have to be honest no matter what so you know there's a whole realm of
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.720]  conspiracies that that exists that are you know much more I guess you would
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.640]  say fantastic and even science-fiction when you first kind of just see the
[47:04.640 --> 47:08.800]  byline of what it is and you're like that can't be really and then you know I
[47:08.800 --> 47:12.440]  was was fascinating for me I mean I got turned around a few things where I kind
[47:12.440 --> 47:17.000]  of was looking at something going like oh come on this can't be can't be real but
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  then you get out there into some situations and then you know boots on
[47:20.000 --> 47:23.520]  the ground kind of stuff and you know there was some there was some pretty
[47:23.520 --> 47:28.440]  hairy moments and some pretty pretty interesting stuff that the truly shook
[47:28.440 --> 47:32.480]  me to my core and some of the things that I saw and witnessed being an
[47:32.480 --> 47:35.600]  investigator in the field I mean previous two years I was in the home
[47:35.600 --> 47:38.800]  office producing and then putting the show together this year I'm out in the
[47:38.800 --> 47:44.880]  muck and running around and getting into some pretty wild situations with me and
[47:44.880 --> 47:49.640]  Mr. Stone well I mean don't tell yourself short you did a lot of the
[47:49.640 --> 47:52.440]  camerawork and stuff that I saw even in the first episode I mean I mean you're
[47:52.440 --> 47:55.280]  out in the field some at this time you're you're actually a hundred percent I
[47:55.280 --> 47:59.960]  guess out there well yeah and we and we made that decision namely because you
[47:59.960 --> 48:05.520]  know Jesse in his battle with the TSA he you know he won't fly at the time
[48:05.520 --> 48:08.320]  we were shooting the show he was in the middle of the lawsuit and then after
[48:08.320 --> 48:14.440]  after losing the lawsuit losing having the judge throwing out his suit you know
[48:14.440 --> 48:17.880]  he refused to fly to this day and takes a train so one of the reasons that they
[48:17.880 --> 48:21.160]  thought that they could bring me and stone in is not only get the new
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.600]  generation of conspiracy hunters but as well as you know it keeps Ventura's
[48:26.600 --> 48:30.920]  name alive you know and it gives the TSA a chance to stick their hands in
[48:30.920 --> 48:34.320]  another Ventura pants I mean that's that's important to be able to I mean
[48:34.320 --> 48:39.040]  Paul gets abused to fly I refuse to go through the microwave machines well
[48:39.040 --> 48:42.360]  that's extremist I mean even the top doctors in minutes can give you cancer
[48:42.360 --> 48:47.600]  how much how much can you get into I mean he's giving us an idea I mean I know
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.440]  you know the episodes but I mean can you tell us some of the episodes that are
[48:51.440 --> 48:57.920]  covered me obviously there's the private space program information is did that
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.920]  make the cut yeah I mean we I don't want to give away everything right now man
[49:02.920 --> 49:06.360]  I'm sure that information will come out as we go along and you know that we'll
[49:06.360 --> 49:10.560]  put it on your show first you know as soon as we okay so I still need to keep
[49:10.560 --> 49:13.720]  my mouth shut that's what you're saying I'm just asking here on there well you
[49:13.720 --> 49:17.240]  know I think right now I you know I just want to be able to you know I just
[49:17.240 --> 49:20.320]  want to get everyone know that the show's coming on and then and you know
[49:20.320 --> 49:24.400]  as soon as we as soon as we get the green light you know and when we do the
[49:24.400 --> 49:27.480]  press junk it and get everybody's attention we'll get more into the details
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.160]  or absolutely we don't want to talk out of school and spoil it for everybody but
[49:31.160 --> 49:35.520]  but I mean give us one of the scariest moments though or I mean I mean give us
[49:35.520 --> 49:44.040]  a little jiblet one of the scariest moments I had was was was running
[49:44.040 --> 49:52.040]  around and investigating an area in in Utah that the definitely shook me it
[49:52.040 --> 49:56.760]  was it was it was a that was on the Indian reservation right it's a very
[49:56.760 --> 50:04.160]  interesting night yeah to say the least I tell you man I can't wait till talk
[50:04.160 --> 50:07.920]  about this stuff oh yeah I can't wait and you know because I don't know the
[50:07.920 --> 50:11.240]  order what the episodes are gonna come in yet so I mean I don't want I don't want
[50:11.240 --> 50:15.000]  to you know speak out of place on that because but I think definitely when the
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  season gets going I think definitely you'll see me you know I'll come on
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.720]  every week after the show after a show airs or the day of a show airs or
[50:22.720 --> 50:26.160]  something like that and then we'll we'll talk about the show and you know maybe
[50:26.160 --> 50:28.960]  take some collars and ask what they thought of the shows and things like that
[50:28.960 --> 50:32.360]  and be great idea we're gonna break come back with five more minutes or six
[50:32.360 --> 50:35.840]  minutes in the short second on the other side and then we've got well we got a
[50:35.840 --> 50:38.920]  crew coming in here who just went down and try to talk to the public

[51:07.640 --> 51:11.760]  listlessness and was stunted in her growth after getting her onto two
[51:11.760 --> 51:17.800]  supplements suggested by Nutripast even here she has improved dramatically her

[54:29.280 --> 54:43.880]  yeah first he's in the back now he's in the front we are talking to Tyrell
[54:43.880 --> 54:47.560]  Ventura going back to him just a moment with some final tidbits on hey the good
[54:47.560 --> 54:52.360]  news conspiracy theory third season very exciting with Jesse Ventura Tyrell
[54:52.360 --> 54:59.240]  Ventura and Sean Stone myself and many others honored to be part of it well if
[54:59.240 --> 55:03.680]  course have the David Ike confrontation which was not intentional but they were
[55:03.680 --> 55:07.120]  pretty freaked out when that happened and called me after it happened so I can
[55:07.120 --> 55:10.480]  have you told David you know off-air I'm no man on there so that was not on
[55:10.480 --> 55:14.960]  purpose so they just it clashed but the I guess you'll get to see that I hope
[55:14.960 --> 55:20.040]  that's gonna be in there in fact going to Ty Ty can you tell us did that make
[55:20.040 --> 55:23.880]  the cut or we're just gonna have to wait and see the David Ike what happened
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.560]  with David is is in is in the show and then we presented honestly for what
[55:27.560 --> 55:32.840]  happened and then you know too too big personalities that got in the same room
[55:32.840 --> 55:37.960]  and then you know you know it was an interesting it was an interesting
[55:37.960 --> 55:40.960]  conversation between the two of them I mean it wasn't just they came in the
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.400]  room and started like brawling with each other anything they had a
[55:44.400 --> 55:48.920]  conversation in that conversation yeah they started to this well I mean I've
[55:48.920 --> 55:52.040]  gotten your perspective your dad's and David's and it's pretty much everybody
[55:52.040 --> 55:56.680]  says the same thing but I just I told David I said David you understand you
[55:56.680 --> 55:59.520]  know that you know the talk you have is real and out in the field it's boom but
[55:59.520 --> 56:02.600]  when they do an interview they spent 40 minutes lighting you to make you look
[56:02.600 --> 56:06.480]  good and they kept Jesse away from you when you wanted to meet him not because
[56:06.480 --> 56:10.600]  he wanted to be rude to you but they want it to be so real and David fell
[56:10.600 --> 56:13.800]  because I talked to him on and off-air he said yeah they let me sit there for an
[56:13.800 --> 56:19.240]  hour well Ventura is right next door I wanted to go talk to him they said no
[56:19.240 --> 56:23.960]  and I think he just totally misunderstood he's from television but not
[56:23.960 --> 56:28.880]  from reality TV and I like I go look he used to be the top BBC presenter this is
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.040]  how they do it now this was not personal so he was already mad before it even
[56:33.040 --> 56:37.600]  began unlike a talk show or something like that you know the host and the
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.920]  and the guest will sit down and kind of talk things out but we found the but you
[56:41.920 --> 56:47.040]  know Jesse is such a lively speaker and then he loves to talk I mean you know and
[56:47.040 --> 56:51.160]  I know off-camera on camera he just loves to talk and then you know loves to
[56:51.160 --> 56:54.880]  talk to people and we just found in the process of doing the show that it's
[56:54.880 --> 56:59.600]  that it's that you miss certain great moments you know where he'll start
[56:59.600 --> 57:02.560]  talking to a guest before we start rolling and they'll have an amazing
[57:02.560 --> 57:07.520]  conversation and then you know then you have to redo it and and it's always
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.160]  never quite as good you know your dad better than I but but knowing now for
[57:11.160 --> 57:14.720]  about seven years he'll talk talk talk but suddenly when he's done he's done
[57:14.720 --> 57:20.240]  it showed yeah and and so we always try to keep Jesse you know as best we can
[57:20.240 --> 57:24.360]  you know we try to keep him you know separate from the from the personal
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.720]  interviewing for as long as we can just because we want to get you know that
[57:28.720 --> 57:32.000]  yeah but I've been on Discovery and History Channel shows and they do the
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.680]  same thing they don't put me with the person I'm in a debate they don't put me
[57:35.680 --> 57:39.320]  with the host first they want it to be real they want that first electricity
[57:39.320 --> 57:43.480]  like boom you know here you go exactly exactly and then and then you know then
[57:43.480 --> 57:46.440]  we'll have you know an hour-long conversation that we then have to cut
[57:46.440 --> 57:50.320]  down into ten you know into ten minutes because we're only an hour-long show you
[57:50.320 --> 57:54.640]  know but but it's you know it was yeah I wasn't done on purpose it wasn't
[57:54.640 --> 57:57.640]  something where we were like oh you know we got to keep the you know David
[57:57.640 --> 58:01.440]  sequestered and all that it's just now he totally misunderstood and I'm glad
[58:01.440 --> 58:04.860]  you've said this because I'll send it to David because you know I like both men
[58:04.860 --> 58:08.880]  I'm obviously know your dad a lot better but I've known David for about 15 years
[58:08.880 --> 58:11.760]  over the phone and I know your dad personally very well but it's just sad
[58:11.760 --> 58:15.760]  to see that but it'll be able to make for very exciting television listen Ty

[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.240]  plethora a cornucopia a veritable plethora would you say I have a plethora
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:54.920]  so that is all coming up here today it is insane amounts of news the real
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:01.680]  inventor of the internet yeah it's not Al Gore it's her Tim Berners Lee there's
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:08.040]  about 15 guys they're all guys and evil evil man and which we just not have
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.560]  internet because men invented it but the point is as that's I'm now being
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.640]  sarcastic the point is is that he's come out and said the government's are spying
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.800]  on you there's a new dark age here we've got to stand up against this well
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.760]  he's obviously an extremist and has to be dealt with you know for not wanting
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.800]  our governments to fund Al Qaeda to the menace us so they can take our liberties
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.840]  and DARPA emergency response a robot can run as fast as the fastest man the
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:40.400]  world in fact faster but of course it's for the military to save you I it
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.840]  certainly won't be used against you everything is fine the government
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.320]  cares a lot about you you know I've got a lot of other huge items I'm gonna be
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.280]  covering today but this this story out of the smoking gun calm is a another
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:03.680]  example just another amazing example of how they go out people like Martha
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.560]  Stewart for a crooked toenail well she didn't do anything they got her on lying
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.480]  to the feds though they claim that's why the feds talk to you it's like hey talk
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.800]  to the hand you want to you want to talk to that hey how's that fast and furious
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.800]  going for you over there but shepherd fairy has is now admitting that when the
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.760]  AP sued him over the hope image which he could have probably beat them I mean I
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.680]  know copyright law pretty darn good because he's he posterized it changed
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.040]  the color everything I mean it's almost completely different and it's
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.720]  political or they would have gotten a tiny licensing fee but instead he went
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.680]  and doctored the stuff that he had come up with it and he got caught because all

[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.600]  Barack Obama Hope poster to serve time in prison following his misdemeanor
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.200]  conviction for destroying and fabricating documents a connection with
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.320]  the civil lawsuit over the iconic campaign the guy made three million one
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.880]  year five million another six million another of course now you can't make
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.360]  anything off of it but it oh seven oh eight no nine oh nine was the peak of
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:51.840]  Obama mania when they were saying he was Christ and stuff so that's 11 million
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.960]  14 million he made 14 million dollars and instead of just fighting the case
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:06.420]  forever with the Associated Press he he went and fabricated a bunch of stuff he
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.280]  went fabricated a bunch of stuff I mean obviously when this when this went when
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.080]  the when the Associated Press sues you for millions of dollars that's not what
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:17.080]  they're gonna get and people are so ignorant but I mean what do you expect
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:25.040]  he was an anti you know kind of like the ad buster people you know anti
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:30.400]  commercialism anti-capitalist communism is rebellion communism is cool you know
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.920]  all this stuff and then he has stores all over the country and all this money
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.680]  and they make hundreds of millions of dollars a year gross and then he doesn't
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.240]  want to pay somebody even if he couldn't beat him because I believe it's his
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.600]  image I mean it's totally different so instead he goes and engages in fraud
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:51.880]  which is exactly what a communist liberal would do they would become filthy
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.760]  rich and then be so stupid they wouldn't even know how to defend themselves
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.200]  and fall into the spiderweb of the degenerate federal government

[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:15.280]  responding to us all over the country I'm saying they've got a test got to test
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.360]  your drinks after the checkpoint that you buy at Starbucks or at water burger
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:22.560]  or whatever the places they have at the airport because it may be explosives in
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:26.800]  it it's about training you that you're a prisoner that you're bad that you're a
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:33.840]  suspect and only government's good it's a new class system and we now have a
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.200]  hoax it was later admitted a hoax just a fake hoax that there was a liquid bomb
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:41.800]  on an aircraft from Philadelphia to Dallas and had to turn back just total
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.960]  hoax but back of the paper hours later oh yeah it was it was a hoax but hey we
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.200]  need this good test because you know the guy might have got a bomb at the coffee
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.440]  shop what they're saying and it's gonna blow you up with a coffee just just right
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.920]  as they're being exposed that magically happens the same TSA I worked with the
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.200]  federal government to get the underwear bomber on the on the aircraft two years
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.240]  ago one week before the rollout of the scanners that have been purchased a year
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.000]  before and were being delivered and they said oh we're putting these in because
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.480]  of this guy now total lie totally transparent in your face by the way I
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.160]  saw police officers at the pool today doing their training and most of them
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:23.360]  couldn't swim by the way I got footage of that that'll be on the nightly news
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.800]  tonight police officers and it will cadets the trainers could hardly swim and
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.960]  then they had the cadets a bunch of them like we're having me hauled out
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.560]  they couldn't swim but they'll be pulling me over very soon they know how to
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:41.720]  ride a ticket and make some money so we're gonna be discussing all of that
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.400]  it's pretty amazing footage I got we're always on the job I'm down there
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.480]  swimming and guys in camo start walking by me and I'm like what is this and I go
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:54.800]  and it was the police and camouflage they had all their gear and everything
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.240]  and they set it up sort of getting in and they were having to haul guys out who
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:04.600]  couldn't swim show that was I didn't realize a cross-sampling of people you
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:08.680]  don't have that many people that can't swim something weird's going on but
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.800]  they're not letting people with Down syndrome's fly on planes now because it
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.160]  upsets the other passengers if someone sits there quietly drinking a bottle of
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.960]  water so I think you might get better officers from what I saw out of someone
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:24.560]  with Down syndrome and I'm not joking at least they have more humanity okay I'm
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.640]  not being mean I don't hate police it was just shocking and I'm gonna talk about
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:36.480]  it later now we are joined by a very interesting lady here on the transmission
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:42.680]  today in fact I'm looking for her bio and she's Lenora Scanesi and she is a
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.320]  syndicated columnist author and public speaker who delivers lively hands-on
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.560]  parenting seminars at universities and community centers she has spoken to
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.680]  audiences internationally and appeared on Dr. Phil and good morning America and
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.400]  many other nightline you name it in addition to founding the free range
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.960]  kids blog book and movement she has written for everyone from the Washington
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.080]  Post to Mad Magazine and I graduated from Yale and Columbia she lives in New
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.960]  York City with her husband and two sons and she thinks children shouldn't just
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.200]  watch television all day she's an extremist free range kids dot WordPress
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:22.080]  calm and of course we had our article cops interrogate family for allowing kids
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:26.320]  to play outside and even in backyards now as children are being taken you don't
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.400]  do that social services harass mother for having free range children so in the
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:33.760]  new country where you can't have backyard gardens and have lemonade stands
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.000]  well pretty soon we'll be able to have more than one kid thank you for coming
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.560]  on ma'am it's a pleasure to be here Alex thank you good to have you okay well
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.200]  tell us about this evil movement you're part of I mean you're claiming that once
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.040]  children played outside I think that sounds extreme al-Qaeda could get them
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:54.400]  that's right and and in a way al-Qaeda is we just call it CPS child protective
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.160]  services what's happening what I hear about a lot at the free range kids
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:05.000]  blog is excuse me parents who let their children play outside walk to school go
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:11.040]  to the grocery for them often have neighbors who turn them in supposedly
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:17.560]  out of concern for them good starsy good good people KGB and what happens
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.200]  child protective services is obligated to come and check out whether or not
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:27.640]  these parents really are being negligent or worse abusive and what has happened
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.040]  is that the parents are found wrong by the police or by child protective
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.480]  services for for leaving their children in what CPS calls a dangerous situation
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.600]  which I would call a normal nice situation in fact less dangerous than
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.440]  just letting your kids sit inside all day getting fat and diabetic you let your
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.680]  kids want to run outside or have some independent adventures that's considered
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.000]  bad parenting out it is so unusual for parents to let their children play
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.240]  outside climb a tree that they are being turned in as negligent instead no
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:05.720]  other culture does this I mean I mean this is completely backwards from
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:09.480]  everything we do this even happens in rural areas I've had families on they've
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.920]  had their kids taken because they let them play in the backyard I'm talking
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.280]  about five and six years old with a fence around them that's not even allowed
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:21.200]  now that's incredible I do hear here here I'm just gonna give you a couple of
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.560]  examples the day the one that you wrote about was a mom with four kids they were
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.280]  outside playing in the field next to her home not at night with it with no
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.480]  clothes on they were next to her house during the day sunny Saturday weekend
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.120]  day and it was so unusual these days to see any children outside the immediate
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.840]  assumption is something's wrong they've escaped maybe they've been kidnapped by
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:49.400]  somebody who knows or could be kidnapped that's the big fear and so the
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:53.360]  police recalled and then the police had to come and actually do a report one
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:57.600]  one person who wrote to me with a similar situation said that the husband
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:03.440]  who came out to talk to the cops was later made to take a drug test because
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.960]  why would any parent except one who's crazed on I don't know math or coke or
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.880]  something even think of letting his kids and again they didn't intimidate you
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.640]  into the drug test getting you into the bureaucratic system but let's expand on
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:20.200]  this you're coming on my show you're gonna get dozens of emails and calls
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.720]  they take kids now and what's incredible is even as the Justice Department
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:29.480]  admits CPS you likened Al Qaeda Al Qaeda's on half as deadly you know
[01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.760]  statistically hundreds of kids that you're dying their custody you're five
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.880]  times more likely to be physically abused or die seven times to be sexually
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:43.720]  abused in CPS so oh your kid might get kidnapped so we're gonna come kidnap
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.160]  them with a industry that's even more dangerous than you know perverts get
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.320]  into the priesthood or TSA I mean this is where predators go is CPS so now
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.440]  they actually come kidnap your kid because they might get kidnapped I
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.320]  actually think that parents are ending up in a way kidnapping their kids too
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.520]  because if your fear is so overblown that the minute your kids walk outside
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:10.680]  some predator is going to jump on them because that's exactly what you see on
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:15.120]  Nancy Grace and CSI you know whether it's fiction or not that's the number
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.760]  one story on television you're so afraid of them being kidnapped it almost seems
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.400]  like the only thing you can do to keep your kids safe is to keep them inside
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:26.720]  where they're going to the refrigerator and they're watching TV this is a great
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.440]  example is I know you have the statistics on your excellent side I mean if
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.320]  you haven't been in front of you go over some of that but kidnapings actually
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:37.320]  flat or gone down compared to what it was but they make such a big deal just
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.600]  like with terrorism that it creates the perception that their kidnappers around
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.000]  every corner right it's like you know you don't report on the millions of
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.320]  children who went safely to school today you report on the one child perhaps
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.840]  it's the anniversary of a child 30 years ago who didn't get to school but
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:58.680]  there's always that one story that the media can find and put in front of our
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:02.680]  faces and then our our brains put it in you know in the file system which is like
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.400]  Google if you ask yourself gee can my kid walk to school I actually got that
[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:11.600]  question today to a lady writing to my site can my child walk to school the
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.520]  principal says it's too dangerous I can see the school from my house but the
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:20.800]  principal says no they're turning everything into a prison I mean it's
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.160]  very simple the schools are prisons and their teach that the nanny state is the
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:32.000]  prison well it does seem completely prison-like to say that you must drive
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.680]  your child or or sometimes walk your child to school as if you know it's
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.160]  like walking across the the yard put them on the school bus where they get beat
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:44.240]  up but let's expand on that I don't think the school bus is that dangerous I
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.440]  think what's really crazy is when people are all driving their children
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:52.520]  individually to school wasting the gas worrying about bullies teaching them
[01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:57.120]  not how to get to school on their own not to enjoy nature but the only place
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.520]  you're safe is in an enclosed space sometimes the SUV with your parents and
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.440]  then deposited the best thing ever happened to me was bullies that made me
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.000]  the person I am I love it I mean I mean children have to learn to have some
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.800]  adventures adventures is true and also while you don't want to you know
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:18.120]  encourage any horrible bullying bullying has been like defined downward
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.760]  dumbed down to the point where some schools have a list of things that
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.880]  define bullying and one of them is rolling your eyes at a kid come on
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.920]  oh but here's the deal when you learn how to face bullies then you know how to
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:34.440]  deal with them later in life they don't want us knowing how to face bullies
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.280]  because the government acts like bullies they want us to be cowards when I see
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:43.000]  bullies now I know how to deal with them I'm glad you do and I do believe that
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.720]  kids are a lot stronger and more resilient than we give them credit for
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.160]  and when we think that they can't handle anything that's when we say no you can't
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.280]  walk to school no you can't roll your eyes remember that story a couple days
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:59.400]  ago the three-year-old whose name was Hunter but he's deaf did you hear about
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.960]  this oh he can't point his finger now he can't make the sign for his name which
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:08.800]  is Hunter this is Hunter and this means it's a name but that is too scary at the
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.560]  deaf school for preschoolers that he's going to because it indicates a gun and
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:18.400]  somehow that gets conflated with somebody bringing an actual oozy in no
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.200]  they're putting us into a total mental illness they're making people mentally
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.520]  ill and basket cases and trying to artificially invoke and create
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.680]  artificial agoraphobia exactly especially where it concerns kids you know when
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:35.120]  we were talking about this case today with the mother who had her four children
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.120]  outside who was visited by the police recently there was a man who left his
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:44.480]  two kids nine and I think six or seven play in a park and he was arrested
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.880]  because he had left them there for almost two hours and that was considered
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.880]  negligent I think that's considered believing in your kids believing in
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.120]  your community and believing that you're a smart enough parent that you taught
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.080]  them don't go off with strangers unbelievable absolutely then they get

[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.500]  into detail but free range kids.wordpress.com she's having a big
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:29.280]  effect to pointing out that we're prisoners you drive through neighborhoods
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.360]  now or you're up in a high-rise building looking at other people's
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:35.520]  condos I'm at a party or something and all everything's glowing blue no one's
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.120]  talking my friend had a telescope but I said what are you seeing is people
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.680]  watching television just 50 years ago folks you saw people playing chess people
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.280]  fighting people having sex because I've read books about how the culture has
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.840]  changed you would see everything with a telescope now you see people watching
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.320]  television it's killing our culture but now in just 50 years it's evil to have
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.080]  your kids out in public I've seen cases where an 11 year old throws a fit mom
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.520]  kicks him out of the car a mile from home makes him walk my mother kicked me
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:11.200]  out of the car five miles from home if I was not doing what she said I mean
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.280]  obviously she wouldn't do it in South Dallas I mean I could see the poor kids
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.920]  that are locked up in war zones but I mean we lived in an affluent middle class
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.800]  neighborhood they're now arresting people please continue with some of the
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.400]  other key points
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.300]  and out is that people are doing exactly what you say they're keeping their
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:34.640]  kids inside and and I point out like the South Dallas idea it's if your kids
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.680]  are in a terrible neighborhood and there's no alternative to keep them safe
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.680]  keep them inside but if you move to a neighborhood because you liked the
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:46.840]  neighborhood why are you keeping them inside you're acting as if you're in a
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.720]  war zone when you have the privilege of letting your kids go outside but it is
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:54.920]  so rare that I don't know if you know about my holiday it's been celebrated
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.320]  for three years now called take our children to the park and leave them
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.320]  there day Alex did you hear about that holiday ever actually I read about it
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.000]  on your site and that's what we need my dad by the time he was eight or nine
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.120]  years old will be put on the bus by himself put on planes you know I was
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.280]  when I was like four or five years old sent to family and and I and he would
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:20.720]  get down there by the time he was like 12 he would go and work for the summer
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.880]  in Houston incredible yeah because back then I mean that's what I want to see
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:31.000]  child labor resurging in any bad way but at least we thought the kids were
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.960]  competent and could add something to society as opposed to us just giving
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.920]  them and doing for them all it does is arrest development I watch police
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.120]  cadets today who literally it was like they had had lobotomies they couldn't
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.560]  swim they couldn't talk and this is what we've turned the public into is these
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.640]  jellyfish right and the idea is that you're being a good parent because
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:55.400]  you're hovering over them and you're keeping them from harm but really the
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.880]  message they're getting is I can't do anything without my parents their parents
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.760]  wait at the bus stop with their children in the mornings and make sure that they
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:07.160]  get on the bus as if it's so dangerous to be there with three other kids waiting
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:10.640]  for the bus as if they can't get on the bus as if there's some danger between
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.400]  the bus stop and the bus and the message kids are getting is I'm in constant
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.480]  danger and if my parents aren't here something bad will happen to me thank
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:26.360]  goodness there's somebody smart and big matter what listen this morning I mean
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.320]  I took my children swimming it didn't happen today but I'll have my four-year-old
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:35.240]  who swims great in like three foot of water swimming you know 20 feet away
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.840]  from me and people will come over and say you need to do something and these
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.080]  are adults that can hardly swim I'm like listen there's lifeguards here and she
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:48.040]  knows how to swim she can swim better than you right I think that actually what
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.280]  free-range kids says is that our job as parents isn't to do everything for the
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.680]  kid isn't to hold your kid up in the pool it's to teach them the skills they
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:00.720]  need to be safe and independent one of them really is teaching your children
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.280]  how to swim teach your children not to go off with strangers teach your children
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.840]  how to cross the street safely because you're not going to be there with them
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.880]  every minute and the idea that you should be is really treating kids as the
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.960]  lowest common denominator generation ever seen well look look let me let's be
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.880]  honest about it everything that happened to black communities in the last hundred
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.440]  years has now been exported everywhere where they put people in these compact
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:26.400]  cities these reservations just like Native American reservations really
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.800]  prisoner of war camps and they get under the point now where everything I saw
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.080]  growing up in intercity neighborhoods I had friends in the inner city where they
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:36.640]  were scared to go out didn't know how to do anything didn't know how to swim
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.560]  that's now everybody everybody is now because it's like weird if you know how
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.760]  to do something it's weird if you're not scared we're becoming prisoners who
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:49.080]  don't know what to do we need to be you know locked up and unlocked that's our
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.000]  new culture it's interesting that you think of it as sort of ghetto culture I
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.680]  think of it for me what resonates is the idea that we are treating children the
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:03.960]  way we treated women in the 1950s and early 60s telling them you can't leave
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.880]  the house you have everything here you should be happy with all the no no no
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.760]  no exactly that's the mode of social control they did the black folks and
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.520]  people and women I agree with you it's now being exported on to everybody right
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:20.000]  as if nothing is safe and then of course if you have a group of people who
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.080]  doesn't believe anything is safe you can sell them anything you can sell them
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.960]  tracking devices for their children you can sell them a screaming backpack which
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.360]  I just found out about did you know that there's a child carrier you know like
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:33.960]  you put on your back and the kid can hang on to your shoulders and sort of be
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:40.640]  strapped in that's good for children up to age seven now the children can't walk
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.560]  I've predicted that that soon tying your shoelaces will mean you get the

[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.000]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.160]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:16.520]  that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.240]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:24.640]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.640]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and

[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:08.320]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.600]  coming up at the start of the next hour ladies and gentlemen get on Alex Jones
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:38.040]  your host thank you for joining us we're gonna have for one segment the head
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:45.440]  editor over at the M4's magazine Russell Doudin in studio with us the NSA in
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.720]  front of everybody back there six people in his big office they're all in one
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:56.720]  big room that he gets a call and nobody talks so he calls it back and they say
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:00.720]  hello national security agency and he checks the number all of it but guys
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.200]  ahead of him coming we got to do this due diligence again we were supposed to
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.960]  get a photo of that have it ready so we can show the photo of his phone with the
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.080]  numbers everybody can use it and we need to call that number again right now
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:16.880]  and we need to check it like I did on the web just double check that it is the
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.120]  NSA number so I want to put that number in the computer check it again double
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:26.400]  check it that it's the PR number of the national security agency because this is
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:30.360]  a news issue because I would get these calls ten years ago and and call back
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.360]  it and then they would answer national security agency and it's a form of
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.880]  harassment and then if you don't get the message then they call up and tell you
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.960]  what you're talking about on an unlisted number and you know oh you got
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.240]  family in the hospital I hope they don't do too good just heard you talking to
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:50.520]  your family so that's the kind of I mean I've had crew see this happen when my
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:54.280]  wife calls up crying and they've done it to her okay I mean this is the type of
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:58.360]  stuff they do this is what our country has become this has happened everywhere
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:01.960]  else we let government get too big and you start bowing down to it and just
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.760]  saying it's your God we're gonna be talking about this in my crew that went
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.080]  down three of our crew members three reporters but to John bow on camera in
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.280]  just a moment before we go any further remember freedom is not free and we are
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.400]  risking our lives to bring you this information we are doing everything we
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:25.800]  can to expose the globalist we are I have hired six new reporters I have
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.960]  hired seven graphics people and writers and editors for the magazine the
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.720]  websites I just hired another writer on top of that so I guess that's eight I am
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.680]  expending our capital because it's all starting to come down and so I'm doing
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.040]  everything I can so later I won't wish that I'd done more you know the
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.960]  Braveheart speech what would you do many years from now lying in your beds to
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.360]  just once just once say you can take our lives but you'll never take our
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.360]  freedom that's what we're talking about and this isn't your life if you won't
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:59.960]  fight in the info war today to get the word out you'll never fight with a sword
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.240]  that's a cop out you need to reach out to the minions of the system and I'll
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.840]  tell you on average who are about as dumb as a box of rocks and I'm talking
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.440]  about bureaucrats all of them of minions police generally are smarter because
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.560]  they live in the real world firefighters are great people I'm not saying the
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.920]  government's the enemy the criminals that have seized it and are trying to
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:25.440]  direct it in a draconian anti-American anti-liberty anti-freedom way must be
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:30.120]  exposed in the info war so you can spread the word about the broadcast spread

[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.160]  operation now most people and believe me I could probably make almost that much
[01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:49.680]  money with like six people here but not reach as many people so I could sit
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:53.560]  here and you know make you know Glenbeck type money if I wanted to sell out the
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:58.560]  system right now or if I just wanted to cut back when I'm doing I'm taking the
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.640]  majority the vast majority 90 plus percent of the money and putting it right
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:05.880]  back into this operation ladies and gentlemen and of course putting some
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.040]  backs we can be strong for frivolous whatever happens down the roads lawsuits

[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:01.720]  war store.com when you bought out 36,000 copies at cost of the new magazine 50
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.360]  thousand on the streets of Austin 40,000 I printed 4,000 held back from we
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:09.680]  start subscriptions next month so you get the first issue plus the next 12 that's
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:12.800]  just amazing sold out of those in a few places refused them so we still have a
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.680]  few left there on the site but the point is is then I increase the price is
[01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.760]  actually sold them for too little and then lost money so now I'm selling them
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.800]  for like three dollars a piece instead of you know less than a dollar a piece
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.480]  like I was because I ended up losing money so there's a few of those September
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:32.080]  issues still left at info war store.com because again 66 locations refused

[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:05.920]  they are okay you think it intimidates me when the NSA calls up I love it okay
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:08.720]  if they strike me down in the fight against tyranny it means I did a good
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:13.480]  job I don't want to die but I don't want them to win and enslave us and it's that
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:18.120]  commitment that spiritual decision to set your weight spiritually mentally
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.760]  physically intellectually economically against the enemy that will bring them

[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:53.000]  a bird's-eye view of the airport because you know everyone has their own qualms
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.320]  about going to the airport and talking to people that work there because it's so
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:05.720]  scary there but I've had it I'm done I'm tired of the New World Order pushing
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:12.640]  the agenda of my life around I'm done with it so I said just go upstairs
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.320]  let's confront the dragon let's go talk to the TSA oh my gosh oh so evil of that
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:22.680]  talking to our God yeah well and and I brought this vampire killer thing with
[01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:27.440]  me it's called the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and Dan Badani the
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:33.080]  vampire killer wielding it as you'll see in the video but when you show the Bill
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:38.080]  of Rights to somebody the cop actually recoiled of the like look at it like oh
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:42.320]  they teach him to stain for it now well it's like shoving a vampire into the
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:47.880]  noonday Sun they they're like well we maybe that's right but wait I got all
[01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:52.800]  this power well let me get a hold of my power hang on let me check you know I
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:56.920]  got a gun other call some people and check on my power and there's some
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.520]  terrorists in the area we just had it we just throw them an in-force blender and
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:05.720]  we all just went off on the DHS the Homeland Security Media well they're
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:09.640]  not even police they have no training who are these people well they had an
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.720]  eight-hour course they can read your mind good hey Linda tell us to tell us
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:19.120]  your take on this well you know after that story came out about the LAPD going
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:22.480]  after people they take pictures in the airport of course we said wasn't even in
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:25.240]  the airport they're now on the streets they're grabbing on the streets but when
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.200]  I called the commanding officer he said in particular you'll get arrested if you
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.920]  videotape at the airport so there's no law right there's no law as you said
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:35.840]  there's no look it up it's just they're false arresting they just said they're
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.880]  disappearing people fear they're trying to get us with feet and the answer is
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.720]  no bully no that's right that's right Alex and so we said well of course well
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:48.080]  let's go down to the airport then because they haven't made that law yet in
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.360]  Austin so we got down there and everybody was kind of up in arms the TSA
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.920]  guys kept walking by and I kept saying oh can I have comment and they're like no

[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.800]  talking about QE3 I believe now I just bought some last week just a few silver
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:45.000]  a few gold is the time to buy gold and silver I believe now is the time to get
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.640]  yourself prepared I believe it's only gonna go up as they globally devalue the
[01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.120]  dollar and other major currencies that they're devaluing in unison and Ted's
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:55.720]  got gold he bought at the old lower prices even though gold's way up today
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.600]  and he's got a bunch of other specials Ted Anderson owner of Genesis
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.840]  Communications the gold company that I had as a sponsor before you even had a

[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:19.920]  was what's driving the market Alex and what we have going on right now the
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.760]  offers that we have are going to be the Frank coin at 372 we have walking
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:30.040]  Liberty halves at 1574 the Lakota Silver Rounds a lot of people still like those
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:35.560]  they're 4096 Canadian Maple Leafs also a very good coin to be getting into we got
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.680]  the US Eagles currently right now Canadian Maple Leafs are trading at 1859 75
[01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.320]  but there's a lot of things that are going on Alex right now and you're right
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.240]  about that we're in the if we're in the fall now the news that's coming out in
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:49.840]  the marketplace actually makes a difference for some reason in the
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.480]  summer everybody's lulled to sleep now we're starting to see it happen where we
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:59.360]  have gold over $1,700 an ounce gold is up today $10 and 20 cents and we've
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.280]  already seen $1,715 an ounce and you know that's just the beginning we're
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:07.720]  just coming into this so yeah if you're gonna be getting in moving in on gold and
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:13.160]  silver you better take your action now because even sober right now at $32 and
[01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:18.920]  75 cents that's up 30 38 cents today and you know we've been talking about QE
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.000]  3 well what's going on in Europe well that is QE 3 that they're talking about
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.920]  billing out all these you know hurting countries well you know all that means
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:30.680]  is they're gonna do is they're gonna turn on the printing presses and they're
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:34.200]  taking in the following the lead of the United States are the best gold and silver
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.840]  million prices you've got what should people call and get right now well what
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:41.200]  I would do if you're looking for something right now I'd look for the
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:44.720]  Canadian Maple Leaf currently at this particular time just due to the fact that
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:50.880]  that coin is 999 fine it's 1859 75 of course there's volume discounts right
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:54.800]  now at this particular coin for those of you who have been very concerned been
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.280]  hearing a lot about confiscation that type of thing you can get into the $20

[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:41.800]  all right Ted Anderson decades in the golden silver business minus resources
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:49.280]  dot-com 800 686 2 to 3 7 he's joining us right now just briefly ahead of the
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:53.560]  NSA report we're going to give you coming up in the next segment Ted I mean
[02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:59.080]  look you read the financial news they're starting to lean towards QE3 I'm
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:01.920]  surprised they haven't gone to it yet I'm not saying go to it but if they don't
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:06.120]  things will really implode but if they do QE3 they'll have hyperinflation that
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:11.040]  will lead to an implosion so we're in trouble either way but obviously they
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:14.920]  drove down gold artificially that even came out in the news manipulating paper
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:20.720]  engaging in fraud but they can't hold it down forever and that's why I've held
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.960]  on to gold I bought at 300 bucks gold I bought at 1900 just because they drove
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.600]  it down a few hundred bucks I didn't panic because it's an emergency backup
[02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.760]  you know I don't buy it for an investment even though it's been one of the
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.640]  best performing and it's now time to get gold and silver but in the three or
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.200]  four minutes we've got here why is gold starting to rock it up and why have you
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.480]  told me privately you thought it would go up in the fall well you said that
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:45.580]  publicly well I mean it it typically does I mean usually in the summertime we
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:48.880]  see our low point and usually in the fall coming even towards the end of the
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:53.760]  year we see our peak and it this year is is like the average year I mean there's
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:59.120]  a couple years ago when we had when we had TARP tarp money that was being
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.840]  asked for we had a great summer and the fall was fantastic too in gold but
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:07.520]  right now you're seeing all this the problems in the United States and the
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:12.680]  problems in Europe have not gone away gold went down to about $1550 an ounce
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:16.960]  but we still had all the fundamental reasons why people should buy gold
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.760]  although when it's going down people back away from it now we're in the fall
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:25.800]  and for some reason you know just quantitative easing in Europe all of a
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:29.600]  sudden triggers gold to go up in price at this time of year you'll see gold
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:33.920]  rise it won't be surprising to me to see $2,000 an ounce gold now because the
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:40.480]  last peak was at 1900 we're at 1704 60 we've come up off a 1550 silver right
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:46.080]  now a 3275 coming up coming up from $26 I mean that's a really nice increase but
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.520]  I got to tell you the the future right now is still ahead of us because we're
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.840]  still sitting in September we've got October to November December I mean the
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:57.880]  elections you think that the elections are going to solve this problem and it's
[02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:01.760]  just not a globalist are digging in like it's the end of the world Ted I got to
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:05.240]  get you on the nightly news like a full hour where we don't have commercials
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:09.200]  except the start and the end to really go over all the numbers and the and
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:13.560]  sorrows buying gold and all the other big globalists are buying it while telling
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:17.120]  the public not to buy it because they know it exposes the fact that their fiat
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.040]  currencies dying while they scurry and while universities buy billions of it
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.520]  like UT I believe now is the time to get gold and silver and folks call and ask
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:29.320]  for the Alex Jones radio specials they've got a whole list of stuff at the
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:32.720]  lower price it's already gone up you regularly call it goes up that's how you
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:35.800]  make money and go in silvers by when it's low so when it's high in a free
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.760]  market we're not communists but Ted will hold the price down how long can you
[02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:42.960]  hold the price down Ted I'm gonna be doing it today and I can tell you one of
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.880]  the things that I have right now I'm still I still have the $63 book you
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:50.800]  know if the two DVDs in the book are the the book and DVD and the two silver
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:55.120]  dollars for $63 shipped to your doorstep you're not gonna buy silver
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.400]  dollars for that price and you get to three and they're almost sold out the
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.720]  Big Brother book that's excellent and paralleling 1984 and then we also have
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.240]  the American Dream DVD about the banking system great way to wake up newbies
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:12.000]  it's a cartoon very well produced hilarious as well a little adult little
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.040]  racy folks probably not good to show small children I mean tiny folks will
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:18.520]  watch it won't think it's racing but the point is it could be racy for some
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:22.800]  people you get those free with the two silver dollars at cost and that's the
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.440]  Big Brother special there's a link at info wars.com or go to Midas

[02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:38.880]  through the London Telegraph where the different inventors of the internet
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.440]  have gotten together and written public letters saying that a new dark age of
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:50.320]  tyranny is upon us that governments are spying on us in mass the one man that
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:56.280]  most scientists agree came with the idea for the internet still looks young you
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:09:03.320]  know this came up with the these ideas in the 70s sir Tim Berners Lee accuses
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:06.080]  government of draconian internet snooping it doesn't accuse him it's
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:10.240]  admitted and he goes on to say that there is a giant web of government
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:13.960]  invasion and monitoring the web woman the British government admits they're
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:18.040]  doing that web inventor warns government internet has no off switch he
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.280]  says you're not going to stop us he's never been a political guy and there's
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:27.160]  all these other people coming out there are new NSA whistleblowers just every
[02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:37.600]  few days that are coming out and saying hey we're listening to everything we've
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:43.760]  got hubs and everything the FBI agent just got caught with 12 million Apple
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:47.280]  IDs and of course they denied it folks Dave under the telecommunications act
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:50.960]  they're wired into everything they're dialing in now going back about 10
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.760]  years ago I occasionally get a call at home or call the cell phone it would say
[02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:59.560]  no number available or it would just be zeros or there'd be no number and then
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.880]  I would call the number back because nobody would talk and they would say
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:06.920]  national security agency and I'd say you just called me they're like may we
[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:12.400]  help you you know this is a government agency who what is the name what is the
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.160]  extension and I would go check the number and find out it was the NSA and
[02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:21.520]  you're my phone would turn off and stuff when this happened it's like they're
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:25.480]  it's like when they call you it does some order for computers to take it over
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:29.680]  that's what I thought it's obviously harassment because then later I've had
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:33.640]  a few of these calls my wife said even more than I have where a woman calls up
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:37.360]  and says your husband got me pregnant your husband gave me a disease your
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:41.000]  husband I mean it's different stories and then she'll say no he didn't that's
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.840]  not true and they'll say well we're gonna get you and we saw your little dog the
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.800]  backyard that's a nice dress you were wearing or they'll say hey we heard you
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.840]  talking to your mommy or your daddy you know I'm glad they're in the hospital so
[02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:56.240]  they they'll call right after you're talking to family and always at an
[02:10:56.240 --> 02:11:00.800]  emotional point they're waiting to trigger fear in you they're waiting in
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:04.560]  the shy off till you get the news that your dad's in the hospital your mom's
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.560]  in the hospital and that's when the whoever it is tapping our phones there's
[02:11:09.560 --> 02:11:14.840]  15 agencies doing it and there's hundreds of private contractors there's the
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.720]  total information awareness network where they came out the New York Times and
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:20.400]  said we're listening to everything you do everything you buy and there was a
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:25.240]  backlash they said okay Admiral Poindexter is off that job the felon now
[02:11:25.240 --> 02:11:31.880]  who got pardoned but then it came right back so they admit they've got it to
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:36.960]  intimidate us but then when we talk about it they then back off okay so that's
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.920]  what's going on that's what's happening here that's what's unfolding now
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:46.520]  Russell doubt none known Russell 12 years he's a no-nonsense guy for over a
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:49.600]  decade he had weird magazine I've now bought it we're gonna republish it down
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:54.120]  the road but I knew he'd put out successfully a monthly publication and
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:57.360]  I liked it and and so I went ahead and so you know we're gonna pull the trigger
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:03.920]  we're gonna watch him for his magazine and it's been a huge success now he gets
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:07.200]  a call yesterday right after I walk out the office I come back in he goes look
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:10.000]  and it says called and we have a screenshot of that we'll put on screen
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:20.480]  and the NSA called him and then when he called it back you know what we may have
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:23.680]  to blow your phone up here on air and actually show people just give it to me
[02:12:23.680 --> 02:12:29.600]  okay okay we blow it up so everybody can see it there is the mobile call number
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:34.120]  on his new AT&T droid phone and Russell's gonna talk to us here in just a
[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:41.240]  moment and that is the call that he got in fact you showed me the call history
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:46.560]  there's actually a area that shows you know the region it came from it shows
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:50.240]  that it you know they called you can I see your phone I want to show people the
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.880]  part where it says they called you that was the data sheet I wanted to show
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:56.080]  people we'll just show people watching on prison planet TV if not if you're on
[02:12:56.080 --> 02:13:02.640]  the radio listening to this you can yeah just pull it up where I can see that
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.600]  because that's Will Jones and other people just just pull that up for me
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:10.400]  we're gonna do this right now here on air so the issue is I'm people to see
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:15.400]  that the call history the NSA called you and the number we just showed on
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:18.800]  screen if you're a radio listener we're streaming video again by tomorrow this
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:22.320]  will be posted for everybody info wars.com is the NSA and we called it
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:25.720]  yesterday we called again today it's the National Security Agency we checked the
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:31.400]  number online it's the NSA so they've done this to me before so Russell you're
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:35.800]  probably gonna get you know the phone call I know your stepdad's got cancer if
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:39.400]  you get the call he dies I forbid that's when they'll hit you I just want to
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:42.840]  warn you that's when they'll call because again they want to terrorize you and
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:46.160]  I think that's the point where they'll freak you out and again this is who
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:50.560]  runs our country this is who's listening to our phones this is what they do and
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.120]  while we're digging that out Russell tell folks the story let me see it I've
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:57.560]  got it I've got it queued up for you right there Alex yeah I'll cover the
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:01.760]  other numbers you've got a whole history here as well because I don't want to show
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:04.680]  people everybody else's numbers and and we'll do another video on the nightly
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:07.880]  news about this this is kind of helter skelter but there it is guys show me a
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:16.360]  document cam shot of that if you can NSA okay 301 688 6524 and we're gonna call
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:21.200]  that on air here in just a moment tell people about your new phone tell people
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:25.360]  about the call tell them what happened well yesterday Alex I was making some
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:28.120]  calls I'm always dealing with advertising back there so you know I'm
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:36.840]  making calls and I received a call on my cell phone that I answered but no one
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:41.600]  said anything it was just like static and I heard a few beeps and clicks I
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:45.080]  thought okay hello hello well I figured well I've called this number back
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:47.840]  eventually and then I got some other calls came in for business for
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.840]  advertising stuff and so then I decided well let me go ahead and call that
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:56.520]  number back maybe it was a you know maybe an advertiser somebody maybe I just
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.720]  had a bad connection so I called it back and it's
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:05.480]  as a security agency public awareness office can I can I help you and I'm like
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:09.640]  I thought I was calling I made a phone call the day the NRA I thought I was
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.560]  calling back the NRA you know because I made a call to them well no it turns out
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.080]  she says no it's this is the national security agency how can I help you I'm
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:24.240]  like oh well I was just returning a phone call and oh well no sir you know
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:27.520]  this is the national security agency where we are you must have the wrong
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:32.360]  number oh okay well all right well thank you and you know I kind of hung up
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:35.920]  freaked me out I was like whoa there's a weirdest call I've had and then I came
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.080]  back in and we just left when I returned that call because that call came in
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:45.520]  before you came in and then I returned the call just as you left and yeah I
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:49.840]  couldn't believe it was you know okay so fairly now you know national security
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:53.160]  agencies got myself on them and how well of course they're listening right now
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:56.320]  probably they can dial in even when the phone's off and listen that's why when
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.800]  Bush would get people on Air Force One everyone had to take the batteries out
[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:02.200]  and put them in a bag and they were they admit well other governments can dial
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:05.440]  in and listen to these because we built back doors in them I mean it's just
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:09.160]  totally criminal by the way each active this is a felony but they just don't
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:13.600]  care they just they they they they grow small children that's a felony yeah on
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:16.760]  the state of Texas says we're gonna stop you they say no we're going to arrest
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:21.120]  you all right let's go ahead and dial this number here on air and this jam

[02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:15.720]  this is the new AT&T HTC one X phone it's well a lot of what happens is when
[02:28:15.720 --> 02:28:18.920]  they've got a tap on the phone which isn't a tap it's just all they're
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:23.320]  hardwired in it all the as AT&T execs have said there's whole buildings at AT&T
[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:26.840]  where they smile on you a lot of when there's a tap on it sometimes they don't
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:30.480]  the number will dial it but hey you haven't gotten the call yet you know
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:33.840]  where they tell you hey we're listening to you now you know the funny thing that's

[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:31.920]  Hernandez because their their children or their child go to a school where
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:35.360]  they're trying to give them satellite tracker boxes they've got RFID going in
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:39.480]  also in San Antonio Department of Defense cameras that watch the food the
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:43.160]  kids children eat don't believe me just type in cameras you know track what
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:46.440]  children eat in San Antonio schools it's a Department of Defense DARPA program
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:50.400]  they're trying to have them as lab rats to train them to be prisoners and they
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:53.680]  said they'd come on the phone I said we've only got like 20 minutes for you
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:57.600]  and they said well we'll still drive up so they were very gracious to come up
[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:00.920]  here on short notice I could talk to them for five hours if we have the time
[02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:03.760]  in fact I'm tempted to go over there after the show and take a show for the
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:08.040]  nightly news but I've got other meetings set up but they join us here are the
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:13.200]  headlines out of WO AI TV and radio poll parents and students oppose new
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:17.560]  school tracking device world net daily rebellion erupts over school students
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:22.960]  shipping plan and continuing here I mean it's just big national news and here
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:28.400]  they are Steve Hernandez and his wife guys tell us about yourselves tell us
[02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:33.600]  about your son who's here and and why you guys are doing this but this is my
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:38.880]  daughter Andrea and it's my son Vincent so we run able to get your wife in
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.640]  with his wife wasn't able to make it okay I mean that's why I thought well his
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:44.760]  wife looks really good I listen I've been so busy you see me running around in
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:48.040]  here during the breaks that I just just just met you right as you came in here
[02:37:48.040 --> 02:37:52.280]  so I thought yes because he quotes your wife you're fighting it as well in the
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:55.960]  news absolutely okay well me tell us about you and your wife and and why
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:00.720]  you're concerned yeah my wife and I when we saw this letter that came out on
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:04.240]  August 10th from John Jay High School they said they were going to start
[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:07.280]  putting these new smart ideas out to work with chips and their tracking chips
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:12.320]  and the first thing came to my mind was revelations because in revelations it
[02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.320]  says you cannot buy so without the mark without the mark from beasts well we
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:19.880]  know this isn't the mark of the beast we know that this is the conditioning of
[02:38:19.880 --> 02:38:23.520]  it they're trying to condition the people into thinking this is normal this
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:27.200]  is the norm and because of our religious religious beliefs we said now
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:31.160]  we're not going to allow my daughter to wear that tracking device and my son
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:36.440]  goes to NISD school but he's not being tracked at this moment but that's what
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:39.360]  I'm fighting for not just for my children but for every student out there
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:44.240]  every parent there's a lot of people out there who misinformed they don't know
[02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:47.120]  what's going on they're just you know it's a great idea let's go ahead and do
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.640]  it NISD has a stronghold it's a stronghold over parents and teachers
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:58.280]  and students they they really it's hard to really so they're trying it into a
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:01.120]  prison I mean you have Department of Defense I sure you've seen that on the
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.520]  news where they have the cameras watching what they eat yes sir and it's an AI
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:08.400]  computer that can tell how many calories you get watching you eat an apple yes
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:11.320]  sir absolutely and that's you know that's another thing we're concerned
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:14.400]  about because they're trying to take out certain kind of machines out of the
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:17.840]  schools and put in this kind of machine they're trying to make the kids of
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:21.960]  something they want them to be they're not letting these children be free and
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:26.160]  and and to be themselves they're saying children shouldn't even play at the park
[02:39:26.160 --> 02:39:30.480]  now they're saying and and they're not only today play at the park they
[02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:33.760]  shouldn't be they can opt out of gym class now and all these other things
[02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:37.520]  this is ridiculous I've seen that out yeah you're not supposed to have dodge
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:41.920]  ball or run at recess yeah because it interferes with their learning
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:44.920]  capability tell us about your son I mean you got your son your daughter here you
[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:50.440]  brought some family as well today I mean tell us the experience they've had and
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:55.600]  and why they're here my son is here to support us and Vinnie's been out there
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:59.240]  with us a hundred percent pushing this idea I'm telling us hey look this is not
[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:04.120]  fair and you didn't ask us you just put this out there and I don't want my son
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:07.880]  when it comes to his school supposed to come to his school if it does go to
[02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:11.560]  school he's not going to chip either I just plan well they get away with this
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:13.840]  they can you do anything and they're saying we want to make people do this
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:18.000]  is incredible and you know and what's crazy here it this program costs 525
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.840]  thousand dollars just for two schools there's a hundred and twelve schools in
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:25.840]  the district and it costs a hundred and thirty six thousand dollars a year to
[02:40:25.840 --> 02:40:31.240]  run the program it's pure military industrial complex profiteering boondoggle
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:34.640]  absolutely absolutely well you're the expert on this tell us all about it and
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:40.320]  anytime your son or daughter want to pop in oh absolutely and yeah you know
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:44.840]  these ideas they're completely useless you know I think it's a waste of all the
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:47.960]  money that we've been giving to the school for so many years you know you're
[02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:51.000]  just going to take my money and use it to track me I already go to school you
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.840]  have cameras every five feet you know you have security guards and you have
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:57.760]  your admin on the hallways you know that's enough protection as it is
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:02.360]  protection well guys can you pull up the Eisenhower quote he said he said safety
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:06.880]  you want safety go to prison I mean this is the opposite of safety a
[02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:10.320]  government trying to make you wear tracker chips some of the schools down
[02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:15.640]  there and in Texas they want a GPS unit yes sir tell us about this and here's
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:18.560]  a thing you have two of them we can document can this we have this one is
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:22.520]  the new tracking chip badge and this one is her old one they're trying to say
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:25.000]  this one's going to make things safer for everybody I don't understand how it's
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:28.760]  going to make anybody safer I really don't I don't see how it makes people
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:34.400]  say it gives out this way Garcia was on Catherine Albert radio show okay from
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:39.780]  spychips.com and said hey this never shuts off it's always it's always
[02:41:39.780 --> 02:41:43.160]  emitting a signal well they caught him in San Francisco where not just the
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:46.880]  toll roads but everywhere they put up readers to track the toll road ship in
[02:41:46.880 --> 02:41:52.400]  fact there it is guys we got a document cam on that there it is keep telling us
[02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:56.360]  about it mr. Hernandez you know and the reason I said this reminds me of
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:01.080]  revelations because she can't even go to school and buy her lunch unless she
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:05.680]  has this kids are being bribed with candy and gifts to wear it around their
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.520]  necks they're encouraged wear it around their necks and then they were also
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:15.800]  told and they were also told that they cannot hold leadership positions in
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:18.800]  school if they don't wear the shit so now it's discrimination against
[02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.960]  Christians or people that don't want to live with a prisoner badge I mean
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:26.680]  imagine what Hitler would have done with something like this oh yeah he would
[02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:28.960]  it would have been worse it would have been worse than what happened
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:34.320]  Andrea does want to share some new information it came to us yesterday and
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:39.600]  it came straight from her bus driver yeah my bus driver was on the bus and um there's this
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:42.000]  big old gray box and I was like so what is that for he goes oh that's for the
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.520]  security cameras and I was like okay and then there's this little black bar and
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:48.600]  it's right above the bus driver's window and I just said what does that do he
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:51.040]  goes oh that's for that home projects and I was like what are you talking about so
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:55.120]  he goes you know your badges and I was like so I get trapped on the bus he
[02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:59.880]  goes yep so they tracked me on the bus as well and but then lied they were in the
[02:42:59.880 --> 02:43:03.480]  news saying we don't track you tell folks about that because we're the enemy out
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:07.440]  of hand they lie to us on every front yeah they're like oh it only works inside
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:10.600]  of the school you know it we can only track inside the school but then they
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:13.880]  go put trackers on your buses and then this never turns off and just like the
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.640]  laptops just like the laptops in Pennsylvania where they watch the kids
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:21.880]  at home yes sir yes sir we heard about that one too what's incredible is is
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:25.120]  that is that here you are fighting tell folks what you've done I mean this has
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:28.200]  become a big national story now the majority of parents I see in the
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:31.000]  headlines they don't like it either we need it but they're just trying to stone
[02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.520]  wall and say we're doing this well you know we we started out with one news
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:40.240]  cast in case at 12 in San Antonio and all of a sudden it just blew up the
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:42.640]  gentleman that's came here today that's out there in the waiting room his name
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:47.320]  is Bobby Scott and I have to give all all respect to him because it wasn't for
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:51.480]  Bobby Scott I wouldn't be sitting here today with you you know what I just had
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:54.360]  an epiphany I've already got two interviews lined up tonight for the
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:59.240]  nightly news this is so important can you guys write one the show ends in a few
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:03.080]  minutes about 15 minutes can I have Aaron Dykes because I've got two meetings
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:06.560]  gotta do ahead of the interviews could you go in and do like a 30 40 minute
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:09.440]  interview where you can just cover all of it show your documents so there's a
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:13.600]  huge record of this of what you're doing absolutely absolutely because I want to
[02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:16.760]  respect the fact that you've come here and that I've got such a busy day I kind
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.720]  of just crammed you in here I don't I apologize for not being more prepared

[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:38.960]  daughter your wife who couldn't be here today I mean because she's got a war you
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:42.840]  guys are incredible you're normal this is what a normal person does when they
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:47.680]  try to give you slave badges and let me tell you what if it wasn't for Bob
[02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:50.800]  Scott I wouldn't be here because he called me six times at work well we'll
[02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:53.600]  interview him in there tell us about him that's why he's here we'll get him on
[02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:56.820]  the TV this guy listens to talk radio and he's
[02:44:56.820 --> 02:45:01.440]  talking about you you need to call this lady Katie somebody and it was on the
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:05.520]  Joe Pag show so I googled it real quick oops I'm not supposed to say googled I
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:11.280]  searched it real quick and I sent Katie an email on the next day Katie called me
[02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:15.840]  and it's blown up since then we've had protests in front of Anson Jones middle
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:21.360]  school we didn't get favorable coverage that's because you're standing up for
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:25.680]  those children who are being abused and inducted into a prison state and and the
[02:45:25.680 --> 02:45:29.760]  media wants to keep this going they're collaborating we didn't get favorable
[02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:34.360]  coverage at all except for the first two on WAI Channel 4 in case that 12 they
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:37.560]  would first two interviews are favorable because they know this could set a
[02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:40.760]  precedent nationwide like Rosa Parks and I won't sit at the back of the bus
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:45.200]  they need to bring this slave grid in there's billions behind this yeah yeah
[02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:48.840]  I think yesterday when we were doing the math came up to almost 40 million
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.160]  dollars for 112 schools if it's five hundred twenty five thousand dollars for
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:56.040]  just two schools and they want to put them in all San Antonio schools 110
[02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:59.640]  schools more and you're the beta test because that's where the whole military
[02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:02.640]  is absolutely and they're rolling it out and they want these kids to start
[02:46:02.640 --> 02:46:08.280]  warning from from Kinder all the way up to to they graduate no I'm not gonna have
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:11.000]  that I would rather homeschool my children first in fact I'd rather be
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:15.600]  here with you today talking about this and help educating people to get this
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:19.200]  this word out this is ridiculous son I mean what's your take on this why are
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:23.800]  you here with your dad I'm here to support him I don't think that my sister or
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:29.080]  I should ever have to wear this badge I mean it's pointless and all the money
[02:46:29.080 --> 02:46:33.160]  that they're putting to the badges it could be used for other things like
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:39.800]  athletics teachers and stuff tutoring yeah but instead it's being used to
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:44.040]  teach you the most important thing that you're a prisoner and that big brother's
[02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:47.480]  gonna watch everything you do this like a science fiction movie and by the way
[02:46:47.480 --> 02:46:50.880]  you said it's leading to the beast I agree but it's pretty much the kind of
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:55.040]  that link that final link because you got a thumbprint facecan in most schools
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:46:58.400]  now to get your lunch that's already digitally connected that's already
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:02.720]  tracking you to get library books this is going in tanning salons bookstores
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:07.240]  they've got Facebook now trying to make you use this to buy and sell it's here
[02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:13.040]  we're in trouble and it turns out Facebook is CIA Google's in SA everything's
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:16.440]  coming out they built this whole fake grid for us absolutely I agree with a
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.840]  hundred percent the things that we've been finding out ever since Katie and
[02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:24.520]  Catherine and Liz MacTower been talking with us I mean we are changed
[02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:28.280]  San Antonio and like me we are changed Texas Hill country all these folks come
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:33.520]  to my house visit with me call me on the phone I mean my email is just blown up
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:36.240]  for those that don't know we are changed as a group that came out of a fellow at
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:40.200]  Luka Dowsky I supported that that's grassroots another basically info warrior
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:43.800]  group of people that just aren't left or right they stand for basic freedom
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:47.120]  absolutely like hey our kids shouldn't wear tracker chips that even follow them
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:50.880]  outside school and the Department of Defense shouldn't have $500,000 AI
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:55.920]  computers watching the kids you know and we went to NISD and we were given
[02:47:55.920 --> 02:48:01.400]  citizens to speak our case so citizens to be heard our came up and we went up
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:04.520]  there was the first one then Andrea and then the rest of the folks who were
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:09.880]  there and the lady by the name of Karen Freeman and she was we call her the
[02:48:09.880 --> 02:48:12.880]  president because she was kind of running the host show she says you know
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:17.800]  we're gonna give you this time to speak but we don't have to act on this oh they
[02:48:17.800 --> 02:48:20.600]  always want you to know you don't have power I've had the mayor and people when
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.320]  I was fighting the fact the Patriot Act walk off stage and they want you to know
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:27.720]  you got your time to speak but we're not listening you don't have power little

[02:48:31.760 --> 02:48:35.400]  Matthew Medina if you can't clap one more time you're out of here or have you
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:39.480]  escorted but you know and that's fine we don't mind Matthew got a actually got a
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:43.680]  ticket for using a bullhorn to help protest because the police said he
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:47.960]  broke the the berry the sound which by the way it didn't because I've seen your
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:50.840]  but that's it they're they're getting scared oh no they're not gonna let us

[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:10.400]  idea because if there was a fire we can track your children and I'm kind of
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:13.400]  thinking to myself okay if you're gonna track my children wasn't attract the poor
