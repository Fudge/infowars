[00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:10.110]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.691]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.252]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:17.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.516]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:48.188]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be an absolutely jam-packed marathon transmission today of overwhelming importance.
[00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:49.890]  We are so jam-packed today.
[00:00:51.311 --> 00:01:06.957]  First off, more and more top computer scientists and the real inventors of the internet have been signing letters in the last year saying that the military-industrial complex and corporations are trying to take the web over and are surveilling everyone illegally.
[00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:15.141]  So there is a mass revolt against the NSA, In-Q-Tel type controlled systems.
[00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:20.106]  InfoPoll 9 in Europe and the British system as well.
[00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:27.391]  There is a mass awakening within the top scientists themselves that we're going into serious tyranny.
[00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:36.557]  And that major Western corporations are helping Russia and China censor their own web and trying to bring that here under the cyber security legislation.
[00:01:36.557 --> 00:01:42.760]  Sir Tim Berners-Lee has accused the government of draconian internet snooping.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.221]  He has an accused
[00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:45.943]  Anybody.
[00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:51.367]  It's like saying he claims the sun came up this morning.
[00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.669]  No, we all know it came up this morning, okay?
[00:01:53.669 --> 00:02:00.095]  They try to teach in schools now to never be decisive, never have a view, never say, you know, they're in the fish tank.
[00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:01.296]  Which fish is the largest?
[00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:02.176]  Gee, I don't know.
[00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:06.760]  I mean, I run into these people with college degrees and think it's cool that they're indecisive.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.844]  It's admitted there are scores of NSA whistleblowers that have gone public.
[00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:14.428]  And said they're listening to everything you're doing.
[00:02:14.428 --> 00:02:16.493]  But it's in the Telecommunications Acts.
[00:02:16.493 --> 00:02:18.518]  It's in the Telecommunications Acts in Europe.
[00:02:18.518 --> 00:02:20.643]  Everything's got snooping hubs wired in.
[00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:21.545]  It's not denied.
[00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:29.169]  In fact, they kind of want you to know they're doing it to scare you, to make you shut up politically like you've done something bad.
[00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:33.270]  But on the other side, then, when it comes out it's illegal, they go, oh, we're not doing that.
[00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.831]  It's kind of like Bush saying torture's good, we're taking the gloves off.
[00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.492]  Yeah, I ordered torture, but oh, that's a felony.
[00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.273]  Oh, well, I didn't order it, send the people to prison.
[00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:44.594]  But then later writes a book bragging he ordered it.
[00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:48.235]  So they play this game of criminality with everybody.
[00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.602]  Now NSA is huge news right now.
[00:02:51.602 --> 00:03:00.775]  I am going to announce here on air a nationwide protest of the criminal, illegal, national security state that works for foreign banks.
[00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:04.433]  I had the idea yesterday.
[00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:07.634]  I'm going to codify it the next few days and we're just going to have media protests.
[00:03:07.634 --> 00:03:12.636]  We're going to have protests outside these locations where they try to lie and say, you can't film us.
[00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:14.237]  You can go on Google Earth and see it.
[00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:16.438]  It's the idea of you have no rights.
[00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:17.138]  You have no rights.
[00:03:17.138 --> 00:03:20.560]  And they're using the NSA to spy on journalists, to spy on Congress.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.781]  They're using it to go after whistleblowers that expose corruption.
[00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:26.302]  This has become a very evil organization.
[00:03:26.302 --> 00:03:29.324]  And their own employees are coming out and saying this.
[00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:31.705]  We need to stand with the good people
[00:03:33.063 --> 00:03:34.045]  Who are in the NSA?
[00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:39.593]  You know, this thing starts with, well, let's spy on the Russians, but of course it ends up being turned against the people domestically.
[00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.817]  Just like you don't want your military used domestically.
[00:03:42.817 --> 00:03:46.378]  Now they say that's anti-military if you don't want to have the military operating domestically.
[00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:51.919]  No, that's called not living in North Korea, or Venezuela, or Communist China.
[00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.820]  It's called living in a free country.
[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.660]  And the prosperity comes with the liberty, so we're going to defend it.
[00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.242]  I will be protesting and standing up, and we're going to have a day where we all write articles about the NSA.
[00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:06.343]  Everybody does YouTubes about it, which is an NSA platform on record now.
[00:04:07.003 --> 00:04:14.787]  And where we also have phone conversations with each other and acknowledge that the NSA computers are listening, and I'll give you a spectrum of keywords.
[00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.729]  Not the ones you think, like, bomb or drugs.
[00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.330]  No, it's going to be, I have the new super processor.
[00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.451]  Yes, we're rolling it out.
[00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:22.912]  It's going to be stuff like that.
[00:04:22.912 --> 00:04:28.115]  I'm going to teach you how to show them we know they're listening and we're not intimidated.
[00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:30.417]  Because you know why?
[00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.459]  The NSA is now calling people here at the office.
[00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:34.700]  Yes, you heard me.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.601]  Phone number comes up.
[00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.323]  We even have it on the smartphone showing.
[00:04:39.323 --> 00:04:41.484]  You call the number, it's the NSA.
[00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:43.646]  So now the NSA is calling us.
[00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:45.247]  It's a standard thing they do.
[00:04:45.247 --> 00:04:47.048]  They used to do that to me a long time ago.
[00:04:47.048 --> 00:04:52.612]  When that doesn't scare you, they call up and tell you what you were just talking about to try to freak you out.
[00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:56.534]  And so we're going to have Russell Dowden in here who it just happened to.
[00:04:56.534 --> 00:04:57.915]  That's just part of what's coming up.
[00:04:57.915 --> 00:04:58.816]  It's a big transmission.
[00:05:01.477 --> 00:05:07.819]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:13.060]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.301]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:22.783]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[00:05:23.303 --> 00:05:27.107]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:31.452]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[00:05:31.452 --> 00:05:37.840]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.363]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[00:05:41.363 --> 00:05:44.467]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:48.191]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:51.234]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:56.339]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.001]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.

[00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:05.691]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.092]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:09.673]  My friends, I've done a lot of research.
[00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:13.799]  And the best gravity filter out there, bar none, is ProPure.

[00:07:17.184 --> 00:07:20.649]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.332]  There's no priming required.
[00:07:22.332 --> 00:07:24.615]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:25.657]  Optional fluoride filter.

[00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:29.679]  Easy to set up and use.

[00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:34.260]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds and wells.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.641]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:41.783]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[00:07:41.783 --> 00:07:44.524]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

[00:08:31.739 --> 00:08:41.925]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we have got an absolutely supercharged, turbocharged, liberty charged transmission lined up for you today.

[00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:17.469]  InfoWars.com.
[00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:34.871]  Now, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we have got quite a challenge here today of news and information to cover.
[00:09:39.551 --> 00:09:45.997]  We don't normally have a day like this, but so much news is taking place just inside the Infowars operation.
[00:09:45.997 --> 00:09:52.843]  Our reporters went out to the Austin airport yesterday to try to talk to the public relations person, and they were threatened.
[00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:54.224]  Well, they were told they were detained.
[00:09:54.224 --> 00:10:00.249]  They implied they were going to arrest them for simply showing up at the airport, because we're enemy Americans.
[00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:11.420]  I mean, we're here to be Pavlovianly trained to have strange men stick their hands down our pants or take us in rooms and take our children's underwear off.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:19.247]  We're taught that after we go through the so-called checkpoint for security, the harassment conditioning, slave training point, prisoner training point, that we need to
[00:10:22.005 --> 00:10:28.869]  You know, then have our drinks and food inspected by them that we buy in front of them at Starbucks or McDonald's.
[00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:33.852]  So, all of that is going on, and we have the footage and the report.
[00:10:33.852 --> 00:10:39.135]  They're going to be joining us coming up in about an hour and 20 minutes from now in studio.
[00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:45.299]  Dan Badondi, as well as John Bound, also with Linda West, they all went down there.
[00:10:46.582 --> 00:10:48.443]  And it's pretty powerful footage.
[00:10:48.443 --> 00:10:49.624]  They're very polite.
[00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:54.267]  And then the TSA and the police show up like, well, you're evil people pointing cameras at us.
[00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:56.969]  We point cameras at you, slave.
[00:10:56.969 --> 00:10:58.911]  So that is coming up.
[00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:03.914]  We'll play a short clip of that in a moment, just to give you an idea of what's coming up.
[00:11:03.914 --> 00:11:10.359]  We're going to have Russell Dowden, who heads up my Infowars newspaper slash magazine operation.
[00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:15.963]  He got something that I've gotten six, seven times over the years, the NSA phone call.
[00:11:16.977 --> 00:11:18.438]  Where it's the NSA.
[00:11:18.438 --> 00:11:24.440]  You call, you pick the phone up and no one's there.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:31.704]  You hang up, you call back on the caller ID if it's a landline or your cell phone and it's National Security Agency, may I help you?
[00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:38.607]  Then you don't believe it's the NSA and you go online and check the phone number and it's the NSA.
[00:11:38.607 --> 00:11:44.650]  The head guy in there over my newspaper and the six people back there got that call.
[00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.671]  And so we're going to show you a screenshot of his phone.
[00:11:48.671 --> 00:11:53.712]  We're going to show you the phone on air, if you're watching at PrisonPlanet.tv, and we're going to call the number on air.
[00:11:53.712 --> 00:11:57.093]  We're going to call the NSA and ask them why they're calling us.
[00:11:57.093 --> 00:12:04.215]  Now, again, if that doesn't scare you, then they start calling up and saying, hey, just heard you talking to your mom.
[00:12:04.215 --> 00:12:06.176]  Yeah, I hope she dies in the hospital.
[00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:10.236]  So they want to scare you next?
[00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:12.197]  Like, oh, you didn't get the hint we're criminals?
[00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:14.358]  You didn't get the hint that we're lawless?
[00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:15.959]  You didn't get the hint we're here to intimidate?
[00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:18.841]  You're supposed to run and hide like an enemy of the state?
[00:12:18.841 --> 00:12:20.242]  No, no, we're not running and hiding.
[00:12:20.242 --> 00:12:21.823]  You're gonna run and hide!
[00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:23.604]  You're gonna run and hide, criminals!
[00:12:23.604 --> 00:12:24.784]  You understand that?
[00:12:24.784 --> 00:12:26.325]  Oh, you think you're intimidating us?
[00:12:26.325 --> 00:12:28.166]  Like, we don't know you're listening.
[00:12:28.166 --> 00:12:29.627]  We don't know you're watching.
[00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:31.928]  We're listening and we're watching.
[00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:32.529]  From history.
[00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:34.770]  And we're going to film you in public.
[00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:35.951]  The police in L.A.
[00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:40.954]  are saying it's terrorism to film anywhere, basically, and are arresting people.
[00:12:40.954 --> 00:12:42.555]  Well, they're getting out later.
[00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:45.977]  The point is, is that they want to start snatching us off the streets.
[00:12:45.977 --> 00:12:48.539]  They want to get a North Korea going.
[00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:50.400]  They want to get a Ceausescu going.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.081]  They're hungry for it.
[00:12:52.081 --> 00:12:53.662]  That's the big preparation.
[00:12:55.402 --> 00:12:56.663]  So that is coming up.
[00:12:56.663 --> 00:13:03.030]  Tyrell Ventura will be joining us for about 10 minutes because he got the good news a few days ago, but he can announce it now.
[00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.293]  His father's coming on next week, former Governor Jesse Ventura.
[00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:11.899]  The show, the third season that was shot last year that I'm in, that is real reality TV.
[00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:13.200]  Let me tell you, we're out there on the streets.
[00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:16.562]  Well, blow-ups with David Icke.
[00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:21.043]  I mean, it's... Most reality TV is not reality TV.
[00:13:21.043 --> 00:13:23.303]  They don't really even call this reality TV, but it is.
[00:13:23.303 --> 00:13:24.284]  It's strange.
[00:13:24.284 --> 00:13:30.625]  But the point is that that is going to air now, coming up right after the election.
[00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.626]  First episode, Wednesday night, what, November 7th.
[00:13:34.238 --> 00:13:36.699]  So Tyrell will be popping in about that.
[00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:41.000]  We also have a mother on who runs the website Free Range Kids.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.081]  All over the country, CPS is coming.
[00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:49.122]  Now have your kids in the backyard, not just in the front yard or running around like we all did, you know, in the neighborhood.
[00:13:49.122 --> 00:13:59.165]  I mean, they're saying 12-year-olds should be inside, you know, drinking aspartame, eating GMO, and watching brainwashing television, or you're not a good globalist.
[00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:00.706]  And then we have Steve and
[00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:13.175]  Andrea Hernandez, they have made big national news fighting the slave necklaces that they wear at San Antonio schools that are Department of Defense run.
[00:14:13.175 --> 00:14:18.620]  They also have AI computers watching the children eat their food to track, quote, their calorie intake.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.522]  I mean, it's a total high-tech prison grid.
[00:14:20.522 --> 00:14:24.646]  Bill Gates is coming out with bracelets that you wear that track your heartbeat and if you're focused.
[00:14:25.246 --> 00:14:49.997]  Just the total prisoner of sci-fi training conditioning the next generation for strip searches everything else They're fighting back against that because I guess they're not good globalist So that is what we have lined up for you today here on the good old Alex Jones show or what I call info wars life I Wanted to call the show back when it got syndicated in 1997 when we began getting on a few stations I wanted to call it info wars
[00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:58.471]  Yeah, I think Genesis folks, Ted Anderson at the time, Michael Trudeau, who was working there, good guy, were right when they said, you know, people don't know what InfoWars is yet.
[00:14:58.471 --> 00:15:02.858]  For ratings, stations need to hear your name a lot, so people put it in a little Arbitron book.
[00:15:03.672 --> 00:15:09.457]  And so, well, let's call it the Alex Jones Show, which I always thought was a bit pretentious, but it is the Alex Jones Show officially.
[00:15:09.457 --> 00:15:16.584]  We call the video stream of it that's at PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWarsLive, because this is the live TV slash radio show.
[00:15:16.584 --> 00:15:17.825]  It's really radio slash TV.
[00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:23.130]  About 98% of the audience is radio, but it tends to all be geared towards visual.
[00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:27.087]  So that we can show you videos, show you documents.
[00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:29.529]  Because in the past, people just didn't believe this stuff.
[00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:32.671]  And we'd say, hey, we have footage of, you know, this horrible thing happening.
[00:15:32.671 --> 00:15:34.433]  Oh, I bet you do, pal.
[00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.255]  And I bet Martians are on the moon and it'll eat my brain.
[00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:43.760]  Hey, the black helicopter just blew up a building next to a nursing home and one lady died of a heart attack.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.241]  Sure they did, Jones.
[00:15:45.241 --> 00:15:46.462]  Well, now I have the footage.
[00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:47.603]  I bet you do, pal.
[00:15:49.261 --> 00:15:50.623]  Well, it's even in the local news.
[00:15:50.623 --> 00:15:52.425]  Yeah, sure it is.
[00:15:52.425 --> 00:15:57.152]  Well, now we can cram everything right into people's eyeballs.
[00:15:57.152 --> 00:16:03.140]  Okay, let me get into some of the other big news that we have coming up here today.
[00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:09.085]  More and more, we are able to make the establishment respond.
[00:16:09.085 --> 00:16:21.242]  A year and a half ago, the White House came out, attacked the Drudge Report and PollWars.com, our story on DrudgeReport.com, and said our policies are not going to increase power prices, even though the energy commissions of the states were saying it, and power prices have now
[00:16:21.522 --> 00:16:23.763]  Some areas doubled, like where I live in Austin.
[00:16:23.763 --> 00:16:26.544]  Other areas have about 25% in the last three and a half years.
[00:16:26.544 --> 00:16:35.808]  And now they're set to shut down in the next year one-third of existing coal plants that supply over 50%, 51% of the power.
[00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:38.330]  So, they cannot respond to that.
[00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.871]  I mean, there's countless examples, but now it's every week.
[00:16:41.676 --> 00:16:55.342]  And even when the mighty drugs doesn't link to our story, we're able now, thanks to Infowarriors and listeners and AM and FMs and people out there to have our stories responded to in a big way.
[00:16:55.342 --> 00:17:02.946]  And you saw this with our stories about the 1.4 billion bullet purchases and the armored pillboxes, the big giant wheeled tanks.
[00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:10.149]  The AP, USA Today, CNN, Detroit Free Press, hundreds of newspapers running the AP article came out and said,
[00:17:11.348 --> 00:17:13.030]  Jones is a conspiracy theorist.
[00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:19.255]  He says they bought these rounds of ammo for civil unrest, even though the Army Manual says that, that we link to.
[00:17:19.255 --> 00:17:25.541]  It's only 174,000 rounds, and it's for Social Security criminal fraud enforcers.
[00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:27.543]  And they're hollow point, and that's what you use at the shooting range.
[00:17:27.543 --> 00:17:28.363]  Jones is lying, too.
[00:17:28.363 --> 00:17:30.786]  You don't use full metal jacket at the shooting range.
[00:17:30.786 --> 00:17:31.386]  You use hollow point.
[00:17:31.386 --> 00:17:32.227]  It's quite normal.
[00:17:32.227 --> 00:17:34.729]  And they had the dean of a law enforcement school say so.
[00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:37.111]  It doesn't matter if that's not true.
[00:17:37.111 --> 00:17:37.512]  They said so.
[00:17:38.843 --> 00:17:40.764]  So, all of that's going on.
[00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:43.265]  Well, the Dean just said they need this ammo.
[00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:46.887]  And then others in the article said the hollow points are quite normal.
[00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:47.947]  That's what you use for shooting.
[00:17:47.947 --> 00:17:52.509]  I mean, anybody who knows guns knows that's not true, but so what?
[00:17:52.509 --> 00:17:53.670]  They're illegal to use in war.
[00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:59.525]  But continuing, under the Geneva Convention, but that doesn't matter.
[00:17:59.525 --> 00:18:11.251]  So continuing with this, they came out, there's still new articles today, scores of them, saying, look, Jones, you know, made up this was for civil unrest, it's 174,000 rounds of ammo.
[00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:16.973]  Just missing everything else in the article, the 1.4 billion, that's why people are upset, but they make it about 174,000.
[00:18:19.326 --> 00:18:20.286]  Same thing with the drones.
[00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:22.027]  We're like, they're using drones to arrest people.
[00:18:22.027 --> 00:18:24.767]  Here's examples in North Dakota and this place and that.
[00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:33.710]  And they go find some other article where the EPA is harassing farmers with manned Cessnas, harassing feedlots and things.
[00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.810]  So they build a straw man, change the subject.
[00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.950]  It's happened again.
[00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.291]  We're going to cover this when we come back.
[00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:46.473]  It was in AP, Reuters, hundreds of TV stations that I can see, just everywhere.
[00:18:47.412 --> 00:19:08.668]  Reason Magazine, CBS News, after Drudge linked to our articles earlier this week and had it featured for two days, that the TSA is setting up checkpoints nationwide with video of it on highways and shopping malls and everywhere else and into political functions.
[00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:09.809]  And the other article was
[00:19:10.836 --> 00:19:19.302]  That they're showing them at Starbucks in places inside the airport, walking over and sticking testers in your drink.
[00:19:19.302 --> 00:19:23.204]  Hundreds of publications ran with it.
[00:19:23.204 --> 00:19:26.906]  Saying, I mean, even mainstream media was like, yeah, why are they testing?
[00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:30.609]  They say it's to be unpredictable, but this doesn't make sense.
[00:19:30.609 --> 00:19:33.871]  So they kind of jumped the shark, as the Daily Pulse said, the TSA did.
[00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:35.252]  Well, guess what happened?
[00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:39.660]  There was a call about a liquid explosive.
[00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.581]  Turned out it was a false alarm and a hoax.
[00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:44.642]  But that's now being reported, you know, page 20.
[00:19:44.642 --> 00:19:47.103]  There was a scare this morning.
[00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:54.106]  Oh, maybe the TSA will get some drugged up patsy on the plane with a liquid explosive.
[00:19:54.106 --> 00:19:57.447]  Like they admit they got caught doing two years ago with the Christmas bomb.
[00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:07.064]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:20:07.064 --> 00:20:10.027]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:20:10.027 --> 00:20:15.431]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:18.674]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[00:20:18.854 --> 00:20:20.374]  Blowing up your food prices.
[00:20:20.374 --> 00:20:28.017]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[00:20:28.017 --> 00:20:31.898]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.678]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:37.699]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[00:20:37.699 --> 00:20:40.320]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[00:21:39.435 --> 00:21:40.236]  This capitalism?
[00:21:40.236 --> 00:21:46.500]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[00:24:40.173 --> 00:24:41.374]  Oh, the drones are for safety.
[00:24:41.374 --> 00:24:42.134]  Oh, now they're armed.
[00:24:43.137 --> 00:24:47.671]  So DARPA emergency response robot runs faster than world's fastest man.
[00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:51.470]  Combat attack robots.
[00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.711]  Ground robots.
[00:24:52.711 --> 00:24:54.272]  Oh yeah, it's not just the drones, folks.
[00:24:54.272 --> 00:24:56.474]  They've got the killer robots, all of it.
[00:24:56.474 --> 00:24:57.274]  It's your money.
[00:24:57.274 --> 00:24:59.856]  You build them, you pay for it, and you are the slave.
[00:24:59.856 --> 00:25:01.477]  Enjoy!
[00:25:01.477 --> 00:25:07.541]  Freedom of Information Act letters reveals shocking case of TSA groping genitals savagely.
[00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:11.224]  They literally try to crush them like eggs just to make you submit.
[00:25:11.224 --> 00:25:13.205]  It's all part of the domination.
[00:25:13.205 --> 00:25:14.346]  Until people complained.
[00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:15.907]  Again, these are sadists.
[00:25:15.907 --> 00:25:16.788]  Who wants to do that all day?
[00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:19.560]  $83,046 for a three-hour hospital visit.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.240]  $83,000.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.542]  Why are hospital bills so outrageous?
[00:25:24.542 --> 00:25:25.362]  That's a key report.
[00:25:31.127 --> 00:25:39.032]  Delusional reality, everything peddled by politicians, media, banks, and television is fiction or mixed with fiction by Mike Adams.
[00:25:39.032 --> 00:25:44.356]  That is just some of what we're going to be covering.
[00:25:44.356 --> 00:25:53.522]  Also masked UK, US, French, Navy's drill simulated breach of blocked Strait of Hormuz, so they're gearing up for war.
[00:25:53.522 --> 00:25:58.646]  Pulitzer Prize journalist warns of physical roundups of political dissidents under Lord Obama.
[00:25:59.466 --> 00:26:03.907]  Chemtrails that don't exist cost $5 billion a year to produce.
[00:26:03.907 --> 00:26:07.047]  They just admit it all, but then say it doesn't exist.
[00:26:07.047 --> 00:26:13.089]  Dinosaur Media runs cover for DHS $1.4 billion ammo buy.
[00:26:13.089 --> 00:26:20.110]  But speaking of that, we're going to get more into the TSA and Ardell run-in daring as media to go down to the airport.
[00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.550]  Oh, police had to come.
[00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.851]  Whoa!
[00:26:22.851 --> 00:26:24.671]  You're not terrorists, are you?
[00:26:26.849 --> 00:26:27.429]  Whoa!
[00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:30.171]  You know, with reporters walking up with microphones.
[00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.852]  No, sir!
[00:26:31.852 --> 00:26:32.372]  Bad!
[00:26:32.372 --> 00:26:35.554]  That's scary!
[00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:38.015]  And so it's been in CBS News, you name it.
[00:26:38.015 --> 00:26:41.037]  Literally hundreds of TV stations have carried it.
[00:26:41.037 --> 00:26:44.279]  I mean, so many articles I can't even keep track of it.
[00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:45.560]  Here's one.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.182]  Why is TSA mission creeping into DNC convention security?
[00:26:50.811 --> 00:26:51.352]  Here's another one.
[00:26:51.352 --> 00:26:55.517]  TSA says bizarre new policy, business as usual.
[00:26:55.517 --> 00:26:58.541]  Here is the CBS News.
[00:26:58.541 --> 00:27:02.325]  Flyers video puts TSA drink screening on display.
[00:27:02.325 --> 00:27:04.428]  Then it covers Infowars.com.
[00:27:04.428 --> 00:27:07.732]  TSA looking for Al-Qaeda in your coffee.
[00:27:08.833 --> 00:27:13.796]  Huffington Post, TSA test drinks post-security at Columbus Airport.
[00:27:13.796 --> 00:27:15.757]  So the point is, I'm not going to keep going through these.
[00:27:15.757 --> 00:27:27.824]  This is a giant stack of, here's the Daily Poll saying that the TSA has jumped the shark testing beverages after the security checkpoint.
[00:27:27.824 --> 00:27:29.846]  It just goes on and on, literally hundreds of articles.
[00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:31.927]  I just, I can't even look at them all.
[00:27:31.927 --> 00:27:36.109]  It'll just, you know, say this article and 40 more, this article and 100 more.
[00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:36.810]  So there's hundreds.
[00:27:38.274 --> 00:27:40.896]  Now, the point is, what did they then do?
[00:27:40.896 --> 00:27:43.317]  This was very easy to predict.
[00:27:43.317 --> 00:27:44.638]  We were even talking just yesterday.
[00:27:44.638 --> 00:27:47.840]  I said, watch them do something where they find liquid explosives.
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.302]  And their favorite thing is they'll have a green beret.
[00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:52.363]  They'll order them to do a security drill.
[00:27:52.363 --> 00:27:53.704]  They'll set the guy up.
[00:27:53.704 --> 00:27:55.866]  He'll say, hey, I was told it was part of a drill.
[00:27:55.866 --> 00:27:57.267]  They'll go, sure.
[00:27:57.267 --> 00:28:05.172]  They wouldn't be setting you up, Special Forces man or Iraq vet, if that wasn't true.
[00:28:05.172 --> 00:28:06.393]  We don't set up veterans.
[00:28:06.393 --> 00:28:07.854]  They're like, I was told to do it.
[00:28:09.395 --> 00:28:11.277]  How about 45 years in prison?
[00:28:11.277 --> 00:28:12.718]  Shut up and we may let you out.
[00:28:12.718 --> 00:28:14.120]  Okay?
[00:28:15.953 --> 00:28:25.121]  So if you're cops, if you're military, if you're, you know, a cadet or something, and they tell you to do something like this, nine times out of ten, it is just a drill.
[00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:29.104]  But the other time, you're gonna be on the news!
[00:28:29.104 --> 00:28:34.048]  Because Al-Qaeda isn't the enemy now, it's the gun owners, the libertarians, the returning veterans.
[00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:35.469]  You're the new enemy.
[00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:40.213]  You're what the armored vehicles and the SWAT teams and the ROTC drill to fight.
[00:28:40.213 --> 00:28:42.095]  That's always been the case, now it's just public.
[00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:46.004]  You knew it would happen though, Dallas Morning News.
[00:28:46.004 --> 00:28:49.312]  Hoax about, and I heard it this morning, I said, that'll be a hoax.
[00:28:49.312 --> 00:28:51.177]  And then by the time I got to the office, it was a hoax.
[00:28:52.796 --> 00:28:55.016]  Hoax, but it doesn't matter, that's now back in the paper.
[00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:59.557]  Hoax about explosive, orders Dallas-bound flight from Philadelphia, order back to gate.
[00:28:59.557 --> 00:29:04.318]  Somebody said, the FBI said there was liquid explosives on board.
[00:29:04.318 --> 00:29:06.419]  And then it was plastic explosives.
[00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:12.360]  And then here it is, LA Times, liquid explosive, fears forces plane back to Philadelphia, LA Times.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.700]  LA Times, it's 7-28.
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.540]  Oh, but by 8-25 it was a hoax.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.380]  It was a hoaxy.
[00:29:19.668 --> 00:29:25.617]  Oh, Hoaxie, while it's all over the news that they're sticking tabs in your drink.
[00:29:25.617 --> 00:29:31.485]  Hey, I'm glad they're sticking things in the Coca-Cola I just bought at McDonald's at the airport.
[00:29:31.485 --> 00:29:32.386]  I mean, they're right there.
[00:29:32.386 --> 00:29:33.287]  Oh, you just bought that.
[00:29:34.076 --> 00:29:35.077]  You're like, why are you gonna do this?
[00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:36.878]  Well, there could be al-Qaeda in there!
[00:29:36.878 --> 00:29:40.882]  You know, we gotta check your daughter's pants as well!
[00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:44.085]  As you know, I'm a convicted pedophile, the TSA guy says!
[00:29:44.085 --> 00:29:48.869]  You're like, well, after all, we need felons to, uh, search our children!
[00:29:48.869 --> 00:29:50.110]  It makes sense!
[00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.511]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:54.033]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:56.736]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.745 --> 00:30:02.046]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:02.046 --> 00:30:07.629]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:30:07.629 --> 00:30:12.651]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:30:12.651 --> 00:30:17.694]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:30:18.234 --> 00:30:23.458]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:30:23.458 --> 00:30:25.759]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:30:25.759 --> 00:30:30.562]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:30:30.562 --> 00:30:31.683]  And here's the best part.
[00:30:31.683 --> 00:30:34.745]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:30:34.745 --> 00:30:38.388]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:30:38.388 --> 00:30:41.570]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:43.791]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:44.712]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:30:48.354 --> 00:30:52.581]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:52.581 --> 00:30:57.429]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:30:57.429 --> 00:30:59.812]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:31:00.598 --> 00:31:06.742]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[00:31:06.742 --> 00:31:09.704]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[00:31:09.704 --> 00:31:15.088]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[00:31:15.088 --> 00:31:18.350]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business.
[00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.051]  Blowing up your food prices.
[00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:27.694]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[00:31:27.694 --> 00:31:31.575]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[00:31:31.575 --> 00:31:33.356]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[00:31:33.356 --> 00:31:37.378]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we've all known this was coming.
[00:31:37.378 --> 00:31:39.999]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[00:31:40.279 --> 00:31:43.060]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:47.621]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:48.261]  Don't wait!
[00:31:48.261 --> 00:31:49.982]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:49.982 --> 00:31:51.742]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:31:51.742 --> 00:31:53.263]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:32:00.325 --> 00:32:03.989]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[00:32:03.989 --> 00:32:05.751]  But not all silver is equal.
[00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:12.497]  SilverSol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[00:32:12.497 --> 00:32:15.901]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:24.065]  Silver Sol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[00:32:24.065 --> 00:32:31.209]  Silver Sol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[00:32:31.209 --> 00:32:36.352]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacterias, molds, and yeasts.
[00:32:36.832 --> 00:32:43.376]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.
[00:32:43.376 --> 00:32:49.300]  Silver Sol Liquid and Gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.

[00:33:10.917 --> 00:33:15.540]  This is our land.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.862]  These are our people.
[00:33:18.862 --> 00:33:20.803]  The workers.
[00:33:20.803 --> 00:33:22.724]  The strivers.
[00:33:22.724 --> 00:33:25.406]  The builders.
[00:33:25.406 --> 00:33:28.868]  These are our people.
[00:33:28.868 --> 00:33:29.949]  Who are they?
[00:33:32.202 --> 00:33:35.004]  They are the dark armies.
[00:33:35.004 --> 00:33:39.046]  The dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:33:39.046 --> 00:33:39.847]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:39.847 --> 00:33:41.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:01.503 --> 00:34:03.444]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:03.444 --> 00:34:07.627]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday edition.
[00:34:07.627 --> 00:34:10.048]  We have a jam-packed transmission coming up.
[00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:20.894]  InfoWars reporters are harassed, and they're told, you know, that you can't leave, but you're not detained by Austin police and others for daring to come with cameras to the Austin airport.
[00:34:20.894 --> 00:34:23.215]  Scum Americans, we'll learn soon.
[00:34:23.215 --> 00:34:25.757]  Out in LA, they're now arresting people, basically filming anywhere.
[00:34:25.757 --> 00:34:27.878]  You're not allowed to do that in Atlanta, the free home of the brave.
[00:34:27.878 --> 00:34:30.299]  You're not allowed to have a garden in your backyard, scum.
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.823]  You're not allowed to raise your children and not take vaccines, filth!
[00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:37.584]  You will do what you're told!
[00:34:37.584 --> 00:34:46.589]  So, that is coming up, and then Russell Dowden, he's got it on his phone, they called him, says incoming call, NSA, this has happened to me, where the NSA calls you.
[00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:50.031]  And they don't talk, and then you call them back, and the NSA answers.
[00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:53.814]  And then you check the number, and it's the public relations number for the National Security Agency.
[00:34:53.814 --> 00:34:55.615]  We're gonna call the NSA on air later!
[00:34:56.542 --> 00:35:09.468]  And the real inventor of the Internet, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, is saying that the NSA and other systems are spying on everyone, and quote, the Internet is going into a new dark age.
[00:35:09.468 --> 00:35:13.170]  He breaks all of that down and says we have a draconian government.
[00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:17.552]  That Pulitzer Prize winner on Chris Hedges yesterday saying the same thing.
[00:35:17.552 --> 00:35:20.934]  Former Bureau Chief for the New York Times for the Middle East.
[00:35:20.934 --> 00:35:23.555]  And I have, you name it, congresspeople on.
[00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:24.456]  Everyone agrees.
[00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:33.105]  I had Dr. Stallman on yesterday, the inventor of Free, what led into open source software systems.
[00:35:33.105 --> 00:35:34.167]  He totally agrees.
[00:35:34.167 --> 00:35:35.648]  I mean, we're in trouble.
[00:35:35.648 --> 00:35:41.655]  If you've got an IQ above room temperature, you know we're going in the direction of North Korea, and we're moving fast.
[00:35:41.655 --> 00:35:43.778]  Okay?
[00:35:43.778 --> 00:35:44.799]  So that's all coming up.
[00:35:46.076 --> 00:35:47.819]  With Russell Dowden as well.
[00:35:47.819 --> 00:35:50.583]  And they're now grabbing people's kids if you dare let them play outside.
[00:35:50.583 --> 00:35:56.552]  We've got the head of the Free Range Kids website, Lenore... How do you pronounce her name?
[00:35:57.796 --> 00:36:02.039]  Guys, Skenazy coming on the show, so look forward to that.
[00:36:28.337 --> 00:36:29.918]  Late last year, early this year.
[00:36:29.918 --> 00:36:32.140]  But they've got to do it or things will even implode more.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.682]  So you're darned if you do, darned if you don't.
[00:36:34.682 --> 00:36:36.624]  You're up the creek without a paddle either way.
[00:36:36.624 --> 00:36:47.935]  But first, here's a short clip of Dan Bodondi, Linda West, and John Balin, our reporters, when they were down at the airport yesterday.
[00:36:47.935 --> 00:36:52.018]  The full clip is coming up with them in studio at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:36:52.018 --> 00:36:52.339]  Here it is.
[00:36:53.178 --> 00:36:55.999]  You took an oath upon the Constitution to defend it.
[00:36:55.999 --> 00:36:57.580]  You don't know what I did.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:57.960]  You did.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.720]  Every officer does.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:03.201]  I have many family who are airport police in Providence, Rhode Island, and people who are state police as well.
[00:37:03.201 --> 00:37:07.823]  You take an oath upon the Constitution to have that badge upon your chest, sir.
[00:37:07.823 --> 00:37:13.785]  And the Constitution is to defend the Constitution and this Republic, not take orders from these tyrannical people with Homeland Security.
[00:37:14.825 --> 00:37:15.525]  They are, sir.
[00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:16.946]  It's on record.
[00:37:16.946 --> 00:37:17.546]  It's on record.
[00:37:17.546 --> 00:37:21.828]  These guys put the, um, State Department put the underwear bomb on the plane.
[00:37:21.828 --> 00:37:24.149]  No, not at all.
[00:37:24.149 --> 00:37:26.290]  I'm just trying to address you as a citizen to citizen.
[00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:26.630]  That's all.
[00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:27.891]  We didn't do that, sir.
[00:37:27.891 --> 00:37:28.571]  Okay.
[00:37:28.571 --> 00:37:32.473]  You went up to one of their BDOs and you didn't really ask your questions.
[00:37:32.853 --> 00:37:34.194]  Yeah, we respect that.
[00:37:34.194 --> 00:37:35.894]  You're asking for a P.I.O.?
[00:37:35.894 --> 00:37:37.295]  Yeah, all we ask is for a P.I.O.
[00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:57.323]  That's what I really admire being on a bunch of these shoots with him is the eye that Tyrell Ventura has with cameras and the shots he gets.
[00:37:57.323 --> 00:38:01.365]  I've learned a lot from this guy just on that front.
[00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:08.948]  Tyrell Ventura joins us again and he is one of the co-producers and new host.
[00:38:09.648 --> 00:38:23.492]  Uh, of the popular third season, Conspiracy Theory, also with The Sun, a filmmaker and actor in his own right, of legendary director Oliver Stone, Sean Stone, friend of the show, friend of mine, uh, as well.
[00:38:23.492 --> 00:38:28.993]  And we're also twisting Tyrell's arm trying to get Harry Dean Stanton, who I was invited to he and Jessie's birthday party.
[00:38:28.993 --> 00:38:31.094]  I didn't bug him at the birthday party to come on, but I should have.
[00:38:31.374 --> 00:38:36.717]  Because I want to get Harry Dean Stanton on the show as well to get his view on things.
[00:38:36.717 --> 00:38:39.119]  Hey, we had Christopher Walken on a few weeks ago.
[00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.620]  Gotta have him.
[00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.582]  But going to Tyrell Ventura, good news!
[00:38:43.582 --> 00:38:50.266]  Homeland Security threatened and everything and got them to erase and not air the Homeland Security episode that I helped produce on the FEMA camps.
[00:38:50.606 --> 00:38:52.328]  It's supposed to air about 50 times every year.
[00:38:52.328 --> 00:38:53.149]  It aired once.
[00:38:53.149 --> 00:38:54.491]  They erased it off DVRs.
[00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:58.396]  All sorts of harassment that I was told about but not at liberty to talk about.
[00:38:58.396 --> 00:38:59.818]  People say, hey, we'll tell you this.
[00:38:59.818 --> 00:39:03.943]  People always say, hey, you have these big meetings with a globalist or you, you know, you have this source.
[00:39:03.943 --> 00:39:04.864]  Tell us.
[00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:07.627]  No one would ever give me sources again if I burned people.
[00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:12.339]  Someday I hope Jesse and others will tell you the stuff that went on.
[00:39:12.339 --> 00:39:16.483]  But let me tell you, they were mad about the second season.
[00:39:16.483 --> 00:39:21.667]  True TV did give them the authorization to do this because Ventura demanded to have free reign.
[00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:23.468]  And then pressure came in.
[00:39:23.468 --> 00:39:27.912]  Now in the third season they kind of took it away for eight, nine months and re-edited it.
[00:39:27.912 --> 00:39:29.633]  So who knows what's going to come out.
[00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:32.315]  I hope it's going to be good, but it does pique my interest.
[00:39:32.315 --> 00:39:35.018]  It's going to start airing in November, right after the election.
[00:39:35.578 --> 00:39:39.361]  And Tyrell, I mean, I think this is a victory for the First Amendment.
[00:39:39.361 --> 00:39:40.482]  What do you say?
[00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:42.003]  Well, I think it's a wonderful day.
[00:39:42.003 --> 00:39:46.526]  You know, once again, the show's November 7th, 10 p.m.
[00:39:46.526 --> 00:39:48.907]  You know, they're back on Wednesdays rather than Fridays.
[00:39:48.907 --> 00:39:52.590]  We don't have to, you know, compete with people going out Friday night, things like that.
[00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:57.273]  So, you know, it shows that they are coming back with a lot of faith in the show and things like that.
[00:39:57.273 --> 00:40:03.117]  And, you know, like I said, once again, they didn't really take it away from us for eight months as much as just a lot of, you know,
[00:40:04.431 --> 00:40:05.212]  I mean, I'm technically wrong.
[00:40:05.212 --> 00:40:09.916]  The point is they brought in new people and sat there and kind of redid it over eight, nine months.
[00:40:09.916 --> 00:40:12.579]  And so, I mean, they changed the project.
[00:40:27.452 --> 00:40:29.053]  Go ahead.
[00:40:29.053 --> 00:40:36.116]  Yeah, but the nice thing is I've seen the episodes that are going to be airing and things like that and they look fantastic.
[00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:41.099]  It's definitely going to be a fun show this year.
[00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:47.002]  We tackle some subjects that I think people aren't going to quite expect Jesse to tackle.
[00:40:47.002 --> 00:40:49.663]  We get into issues that he doesn't believe.
[00:40:50.243 --> 00:41:03.551]  You know, which is a, you know, which, you know, a lot of times in the shows, you know, we'd always kind of go forward with things that, you know, he kind of had an initial instinct to, ooh, you know, something might be, you know, something might be a little wonky in Denmark there.
[00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:12.577]  But this year we kind of, you know, we went after some controversial issues within the conspiracy theory world, you know, out there in the ether, you know.
[00:41:12.577 --> 00:41:14.338]  So it's going to be a good season, man.
[00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:18.821]  It's wild and wooly, and it was a lot of fun working with Sean Stone, and it's going to be a good show.
[00:41:19.522 --> 00:41:23.443]  Tyrell, I gotta tell you, you look ultra cool on the Skype right now.
[00:41:23.443 --> 00:41:25.743]  It was my first Skype appearance on your show.
[00:41:25.743 --> 00:41:28.044]  I figured I had to gussy it up a little bit.
[00:41:28.044 --> 00:41:30.664]  No, no.
[00:41:30.664 --> 00:41:39.326]  I tell you, Tyrell, there is so much to go over here, but kind of give us a little bit of a sneak peek of what's coming up.
[00:41:39.326 --> 00:41:41.667]  Your father would say, hey, I've done the research.
[00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:42.907]  Wall Street's running scams.
[00:41:42.907 --> 00:41:44.107]  Let's go investigate.
[00:41:44.107 --> 00:41:45.547]  He'd go talk to Wall Street insiders.
[00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:47.408]  Or, we know what's happening with water.
[00:41:48.388 --> 00:41:56.319]  What they're putting in the water, the lithium, the fluoride, but also that they're gobbling it up and handing it over to foreign powers, foreign corporations.
[00:41:56.319 --> 00:42:00.104]  And issues like that, real meat and potatoes have never been on TV.
[00:42:00.104 --> 00:42:01.325]  Normally a conspiracy show...
[00:42:02.495 --> 00:42:13.462]  Would do the Mind Control, or the Little Green Men, or Chupacabras, or Reptoids, or things like that first, and then never do the two seasons you did.
[00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:18.546]  This time, you're going out and doing some of the other secret space program type stuff.
[00:42:18.546 --> 00:42:27.472]  I mean, there's a lot of really hardcore serious ones as well, but you guys also approach the issues that have been seen as a little more out there, but in a serious way.
[00:42:27.472 --> 00:42:31.915]  Most of those shows, I don't want to sit here and interview myself, but talk about that.
[00:42:32.455 --> 00:42:41.923]  Well, you know, we decided this year that there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of conspiracies, like you say, that are to the average John Q. citizen a little bit more out there.
[00:42:41.923 --> 00:42:45.285]  And like, whoa, that sounds a little nuts.
[00:42:45.285 --> 00:42:49.209]  And so we decided to see what Jesse's take would be on these.
[00:42:49.209 --> 00:42:57.795]  And so as an investigative team, we started to go in there and seeing, you know, how much, you know, fact is within the fiction and how much fiction is within the facts.
[00:42:58.796 --> 00:43:01.578]  And because we felt, you know, it's a service.
[00:43:01.578 --> 00:43:03.580]  You know, we're an informational show.
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.581]  We're an entertainment show and an informational show.
[00:43:05.581 --> 00:43:14.388]  And we felt that it would be a good idea to get into a little bit more of those out there subjects just to kind of see, you know, how much truth is there to them.
[00:43:14.988 --> 00:43:17.328]  Uh, if there's truth, we put it on the air.
[00:43:17.328 --> 00:43:19.709]  If they're not truthful, then we put that on the air.
[00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:26.530]  Uh, just to show that, you know, we're not, we don't always, you know, we don't always just push the agenda of conspiracy.
[00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.071]  There are a lot of bogus conspiracies as much as there's real conspiracies.
[00:43:30.071 --> 00:43:34.571]  And hopefully we can shed a few, a little bit more light on all those this year.
[00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:36.552]  And, uh, it's going to be a hell of a season.
[00:43:36.552 --> 00:43:38.072]  I mean, it was a lot of fun to shoot.
[00:43:38.072 --> 00:43:40.152]  It was a breakneck schedule and shooting.
[00:43:40.152 --> 00:43:43.793]  Uh, and, and, you know, I'm sorry for the delay, but we are back on.
[00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:44.573]  You didn't die!
[00:44:05.823 --> 00:44:06.664]  Yes, thank you all.
[00:44:06.664 --> 00:44:09.445]  I thank you all for keeping us on.
[00:44:09.445 --> 00:44:15.248]  We had a hell of a second season and that's one of the main reasons they brought us back.
[00:44:15.248 --> 00:44:18.710]  We're a season-to-season show, so the viewership counts.
[00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.371]  They don't have us slated for three more seasons after this.
[00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:26.654]  We go season-to-season, so you guys' support and viewership is what's important.
[00:44:26.654 --> 00:44:28.635]  The viewer mail that they get, things like that.
[00:44:28.635 --> 00:44:30.576]  These are all important things to keep us on the air.
[00:44:32.168 --> 00:44:35.089]  Now, expanding on this, because I haven't seen the edits.
[00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:38.930]  I mean, I was part of some of the shows, consulted some, but I haven't seen it, so I don't know.
[00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:46.012]  But from what I saw, you guys really go out, and what you see is real, and you try to discover what's happening.
[00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:48.672]  But the subjects before were pretty much vetted.
[00:44:48.672 --> 00:44:51.373]  You know, is global warming real, or is it a scam?
[00:44:51.373 --> 00:44:54.454]  All of this, and you go out and really interview the experts on both sides.
[00:44:55.454 --> 00:45:04.339]  In this case, you guys really didn't know, and you truly went out to investigate things that you guys thought might be baloney, and there's some confrontations here.
[00:45:04.339 --> 00:45:10.762]  So it's not so much a debunking show, but when you run into Bull, though, I think there is some debunking.
[00:45:10.762 --> 00:45:12.183]  I mean, is that accurate?
[00:45:12.183 --> 00:45:14.224]  It's not a debunking show at all.
[00:45:14.224 --> 00:45:21.708]  Jesse's standard kind of rules and laws that he put out to us as the investigators were, you bring me what is truth.
[00:45:22.475 --> 00:45:24.376]  You know, and that's his rule.
[00:45:24.376 --> 00:45:35.605]  Whatever the truth is, as best we can, you know, figure it out from the experts we talk to and the locations we go to, you bring me back the truth, no matter how crazy and weird it is.
[00:45:35.605 --> 00:45:37.126]  So no, it's not a debunking show.
[00:45:37.126 --> 00:45:41.029]  We never went out saying, oh, we're going to debunk this and we're going to throw this out.
[00:45:41.029 --> 00:45:43.831]  If in the process of investigation, we
[00:45:45.533 --> 00:45:49.536]  We see that, you know, it just doesn't quite hold water.
[00:45:49.536 --> 00:45:52.217]  We tell the truth about it, it doesn't quite hold water.
[00:45:52.217 --> 00:46:01.682]  The same as if we're in the process of an investigation, if we suddenly see that, wow, this is actually, there's some fire amidst the smoke here, we show that.
[00:46:01.682 --> 00:46:05.725]  Can we talk about some of the... We don't start with an agenda.
[00:46:05.725 --> 00:46:11.868]  We start from simply, okay, here's the experts, here's the facts that are known, let's go out and see if this is accurate.
[00:46:12.707 --> 00:46:20.810]  And I can 100% attest to this, being part of all three seasons, that you guys say, let's go see what's happening on Wall Street.
[00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:22.550]  Let's go see what's happening on the water.
[00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:24.611]  Let's go see what's happening in Area 51.
[00:46:24.611 --> 00:46:28.272]  Let's go investigate this and go out and do it.
[00:46:28.272 --> 00:46:31.793]  My point is, this is a little more wild, some of the subjects.
[00:46:31.793 --> 00:46:35.894]  What, like half the episodes would be seen as traditionally kind of out there?
[00:46:37.414 --> 00:46:38.055]  Yeah, I don't know.
[00:46:38.055 --> 00:46:44.789]  I mean, to John Q. Citizen, who's not, you know, awake to these sort of things, all of our subjects are a little bit out there.
[00:46:45.748 --> 00:46:46.789]  Exactly.
[00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:52.293]  But, you know, I think you have to be honest no matter what.
[00:46:52.293 --> 00:47:07.645]  So, you know, there's a whole realm of conspiracies that exist that are, you know, much more, I guess you would say, fantastic and even science fiction-y when you first kind of just see the byline of what it is and you're like, that can't be, really?
[00:47:07.645 --> 00:47:10.347]  And then, you know, that was what was fascinating for me.
[00:47:10.347 --> 00:47:14.831]  I mean, I got turned around on a few things where I kind of was looking at something going like, oh, come on, this can't be.
[00:47:15.371 --> 00:47:33.558]  Can't be real, but then you get out there into some situations and then you know boots on the ground kind of stuff and you know there was some there was some pretty hairy moments and some pretty pretty Interesting stuff that truly shook me to my core and some of the things that I saw and witnessed Being an investigator in the field.
[00:47:33.558 --> 00:47:35.058]  I mean previous two years.
[00:47:35.058 --> 00:47:36.459]  I was in the home office producing
[00:47:36.479 --> 00:47:38.180]  Well, I mean, don't sell yourself short.
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.324]  You did a lot of the camera work and stuff that I saw even on the first episode.
[00:47:42.324 --> 00:47:48.289]  I mean, you're out in the field some, but this time you're actually 100%, I guess, out there.
[00:47:56.451 --> 00:48:05.194]  Well, yeah, and we made that decision namely because, you know, Jesse in his battle with the TSA, he won't fly.
[00:48:05.194 --> 00:48:16.858]  At the time we were shooting the show, he was in the middle of the lawsuit, and then after losing the lawsuit, having the judge throwing out his suit, he refused to fly to this day and takes a train.
[00:48:16.858 --> 00:48:22.900]  So one of the reasons that they thought that they could bring me and Stone in is not only get the new generation of conspiracy hunters,
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.522]  But as well as, you know, it keeps Ventura's name alive, you know.
[00:48:28.522 --> 00:48:32.043]  And it gives the TSA a chance to stick their hands in another Ventura pants.
[00:48:32.043 --> 00:48:34.163]  I mean, that's important to be able to.
[00:48:34.163 --> 00:48:35.223]  I mean, Ron Paul gets abused.
[00:48:35.223 --> 00:48:36.604]  It's just so fun to fly.
[00:48:36.604 --> 00:48:38.904]  I refuse to go through the microwave machines.
[00:48:38.904 --> 00:48:39.885]  Well, that's extremist.
[00:48:39.885 --> 00:48:42.285]  I mean, even the top doctors in minutes can give you cancer.
[00:48:44.574 --> 00:48:45.595]  How much can you get into?
[00:48:45.595 --> 00:48:47.256]  I mean, he's giving us an idea.
[00:48:47.256 --> 00:48:51.720]  I mean, I know, you know, the episodes, but, I mean, can you tell us some of the episodes that are covered?
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.465]  I mean, obviously, there's the private space program information.
[00:48:57.465 --> 00:48:59.707]  Did that make the cut?
[00:48:59.707 --> 00:49:03.290]  Yeah, I mean, I don't want to give away everything right now, man.
[00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:11.677]  I'm sure that information will come out as we go along, and you know that we'll put it on your show first, you know, as soon as we... Okay, so I still need to keep my mouth shut is what you're saying.
[00:49:11.677 --> 00:49:12.878]  I'm just asking you here on air.
[00:49:13.416 --> 00:49:27.641]  Well, you know, I think right now, you know, I just want to be able to, you know, I just want to get everyone to know that the show's coming on, and then, you know, as soon as we get the green light, you know, and when we do the press junket and get everybody's attention, we'll get more into the details.
[00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:28.342]  Sure, absolutely.
[00:49:28.342 --> 00:49:37.805]  We don't want to talk out of school and spoil it for everybody, but, I mean, give us one of the scariest moments, though, or, I mean, give us a little giblet.
[00:49:37.805 --> 00:49:39.706]  One of the scariest moments I had was...
[00:49:41.909 --> 00:49:51.998]  Was running around and investigating an area in Utah that definitely shook me.
[00:49:51.998 --> 00:49:55.942]  That was on the Indian Reservation, right?
[00:49:55.942 --> 00:49:59.945]  It was a very interesting night.
[00:49:59.945 --> 00:50:03.048]  Yeah, to say the least, I tell ya.
[00:50:03.048 --> 00:50:04.910]  Man, I can't wait to be able to talk about this stuff.
[00:50:05.524 --> 00:50:06.665]  Oh, yeah, I can't wait.
[00:50:06.665 --> 00:50:10.067]  I mean, you know, because I don't know the order what the episodes are going to come in yet.
[00:50:10.067 --> 00:50:23.496]  So I mean, I don't want I don't want to, you know, speak out of place on that because but I think definitely when the season gets going, I think definitely you'll see me, you know, I'll come on every week after the show after a show airs or the day of the show airs or something like that.
[00:50:23.496 --> 00:50:29.740]  And then we'll we'll we'll talk about the show and, you know, maybe take some callers and ask what they thought of the shows and things like that and be great idea.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:30.901]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[00:50:30.901 --> 00:50:34.483]  Come back with five more minutes or six minutes in the short segment on the other side.
[00:50:34.483 --> 00:50:36.804]  Then we've got, well, we got our crew coming in here.
[00:50:36.804 --> 00:50:40.727]  They just went down and tried to talk to the public information officer.
[00:50:40.727 --> 00:50:43.209]  They even call just the PR people officers now.
[00:50:43.209 --> 00:50:45.550]  The mayor calls himself an officer where I live.
[00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:47.792]  We're all civilian scum.
[00:50:47.792 --> 00:50:52.695]  And they let us know, you know, you watch yourself, you American filth.
[00:50:52.695 --> 00:50:55.497]  You don't have a First Amendment, pound sand.
[00:50:55.497 --> 00:50:56.257]  So that's coming up.
[00:50:56.257 --> 00:50:58.719]  And we got a call from the NSA yesterday.
[00:50:58.719 --> 00:50:59.500]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:50:59.940]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:10.663]  My name is Angie, and ever since my daughter had alternating diarrhea and constipation, she suffered from hair loss, listlessness, and was stunted in her growth.
[00:51:10.663 --> 00:51:17.705]  After getting her onto two supplements suggested by neutropath Stephen Huer, she has improved dramatically.
[00:51:17.705 --> 00:51:23.586]  Her stools have normalized, her hair and her body are growing again, and she's beaming.
[00:51:23.586 --> 00:51:26.507]  I credit the majority of her improvement to One Real Way.
[00:51:26.747 --> 00:51:31.911]  Children love the taste of One World Whey and their growing bodies are getting nature's best source of protein.
[00:51:31.911 --> 00:51:38.996]  Evidence shows that non-denatured whey protein powder is a better source of protein than meat, milk, or eggs.
[00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:47.223]  If you have finicky children and you want a protein that will support their growth, energy, and healthy brain function, One World Whey is a must for you to try.
[00:51:47.223 --> 00:51:49.284]  Kids prefer it over junk food.

[00:53:52.348 --> 00:53:53.809]  There's a scene you might want to catch.
[00:54:14.249 --> 00:54:20.751]  Yeah, first he's in the back, now he's in the front.
[00:54:42.515 --> 00:54:44.316]  We are talking to Tyrell Ventura.
[00:54:44.316 --> 00:54:47.919]  Going back to him in just a moment with some final tidbits on, hey, the good news.
[00:54:47.919 --> 00:54:49.860]  Conspiracy Theory, third season.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:56.284]  Very exciting with Jesse Ventura, Tyrell Ventura, and Sean Stone, myself, and many others.
[00:54:56.284 --> 00:54:57.365]  Honored to be part of it.
[00:54:58.988 --> 00:55:03.512]  We'll of course have the David Icke confrontation, which was not intentional.
[00:55:03.512 --> 00:55:06.014]  They were pretty freaked out when that happened and called me after it happened.
[00:55:06.014 --> 00:55:11.098]  I even told David off air and on air, I said that was not on purpose.
[00:55:11.098 --> 00:55:13.920]  It just clashed.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.780]  I guess you'll get to see that.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:17.022]  I hope that's going to be in there.
[00:55:17.022 --> 00:55:18.323]  In fact, going to Ty.
[00:55:18.323 --> 00:55:21.566]  Ty, can you tell us, did that make the cut or are we just going to have to wait and see?
[00:55:23.468 --> 00:55:29.753]  What happened with David is in the show and we presented it honestly for what happened.
[00:55:29.753 --> 00:55:36.720]  Two big personalities that got in the same room.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.842]  It was an interesting conversation between the two of them.
[00:55:39.842 --> 00:55:43.506]  It wasn't just that they came in the room and started brawling with each other or anything like that.
[00:55:44.026 --> 00:55:45.347]  They had a conversation.
[00:55:45.347 --> 00:55:48.570]  In that conversation, they started to disagree.
[00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:55.277]  Well, I mean, I've gotten your perspective, your dad's and David's, and it's pretty much everybody says the same thing, but I just told David, I said, David, you don't understand.
[00:55:56.643 --> 00:56:09.569]  You know, the talk you have is real, and out in the field it's boom, but when they do an interview, they spent 40 minutes lighting you to make you look good, and they kept Jesse away from you when you wanted to meet him, not because he wanted to be rude to you, but they want it to be so real.
[00:56:09.569 --> 00:56:15.772]  And David felt, because I talked to him on and off air, he said, yeah, they let me sit there for an hour while Ventura's right next door.
[00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:17.532]  I wanted to go talk to him.
[00:56:17.532 --> 00:56:22.254]  They said no, and I think he just totally misunderstood.
[00:56:22.254 --> 00:56:23.315]  He's from television.
[00:56:23.635 --> 00:56:25.036]  But not from reality TV.
[00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:46.432]  You know, Jesse is such a lively speaker and he loves to talk.
[00:56:46.432 --> 00:56:52.315]  I mean, you and I know off-camera, on-camera, he just loves to talk and loves to talk to people.
[00:56:52.315 --> 00:57:08.744]  And we just found in the process of doing the show that you miss certain great moments, you know, where he'll start talking to a guest before we start rolling and they'll have an amazing conversation and then, you know, then you have to redo it and it's always never quite as good.
[00:57:09.104 --> 00:57:14.888]  You know your dad better than I, but knowing him now for about seven years, he'll talk, talk, talk, but suddenly when he's done, he's done.
[00:57:14.888 --> 00:57:28.757]  Yeah, and so we always try to keep Jesse, you know, as best we can, you know, we try to keep him, you know, separate from the person we're interviewing for as long as we can just because we want to get, you know, that
[00:57:28.797 --> 00:57:32.820]  Yeah, but I've been on Discovery and History Channel shows, and they do the same thing.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.082]  They don't put me with the person I'm going to debate.
[00:57:35.082 --> 00:57:36.823]  They don't put me with the host first.
[00:57:36.823 --> 00:57:37.884]  They want it to be real.
[00:57:37.884 --> 00:57:41.407]  They want that first electricity, like, boom, you know, here you go.
[00:57:41.407 --> 00:57:42.608]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:57:42.608 --> 00:57:49.714]  And then, you know, then we'll have, you know, an hour-long conversation that we then have to cut down into ten, you know, into ten minutes because we're only an hour-long show.
[00:57:50.214 --> 00:57:54.277]  You know, but, but it's, uh, you know, it was, you know, it wasn't done on purpose.
[00:57:54.277 --> 00:57:59.300]  It wasn't something where we were like, Oh, you know, we got to keep the, you know, David sequestered and all that.
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.081]  It's just totally misunderstood.
[00:58:01.081 --> 00:58:03.743]  And I'm glad you've said this cause I'll send it to David.
[00:58:03.743 --> 00:58:04.964]  Cause you know, I like both men.
[00:58:04.964 --> 00:58:09.767]  I obviously know your dad a lot better, but I've known David for about 15 years over the phone.
[00:58:09.767 --> 00:58:14.851]  And I know your dad personally very well, but it's just sad to see that, but it'll be, it'll make for very exciting television.
[00:58:14.851 --> 00:58:16.752]  Uh, listen, Ty, thank you so much.
[00:58:16.752 --> 00:58:19.634]  Give us your dad's website and give us your website.
[00:58:20.154 --> 00:58:25.435]  Once again, it's WeAin'tGotTimeToBleed.com and then also Jesse Ventura, the official Facebook page.
[00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:27.735]  I'm a little behind on updating WeAin'tGotTimeToBleed.
[00:58:27.735 --> 00:58:31.116]  I've been caught up in a lot of other things, but Facebook's a little easier for me to update.
[00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:33.596]  And for Jesse to update, it's a little easier for him to hit the platform.
[00:58:33.596 --> 00:58:36.977]  We've got to have you on soon about all the other projects you've got going.
[00:58:36.977 --> 00:58:37.977]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[00:58:37.977 --> 00:58:43.518]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.518 --> 00:58:47.479]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.848 --> 00:58:56.351]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?

[01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:10.478]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.478 --> 01:00:12.080]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.982]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:17.807 --> 01:00:21.871]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.933 --> 01:00:38.274]  Alright, we got two hours stretching out before us.
[01:00:38.274 --> 01:00:39.855]  Document cam, please.
[01:00:39.855 --> 01:00:45.798]  With a plethora, a cornucopia, a veritable plethora.
[01:00:45.798 --> 01:00:47.798]  Would you say I have a plethora?
[01:00:47.798 --> 01:00:51.680]  So, that is all coming up here today.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.541]  It is insane amounts of news.
[01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:58.223]  The real inventor of the internet, yeah, it's not Al Gore.
[01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:01.194]  It's Sir Tim Berners-Lee.
[01:01:01.194 --> 01:01:02.935]  There's about 15 guys.
[01:01:02.935 --> 01:01:04.176]  They're all guys.
[01:01:04.176 --> 01:01:07.158]  And evil, evil men.
[01:01:07.158 --> 01:01:09.119]  And we should just not have internet because men invented it.
[01:01:09.119 --> 01:01:15.262]  But the point is, as that's, now I'm being sarcastic, the point is, is that he's come out and said the government's are spying on you.
[01:01:15.262 --> 01:01:16.723]  There's a new dark age here.
[01:01:16.723 --> 01:01:17.864]  We've got to stand up against this.
[01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:28.306]  Well he's obviously an extremist and has to be dealt with for not wanting our governments to fund Al Qaeda to then menace us so they can take our liberties.
[01:01:28.306 --> 01:01:33.151]  And DARPA emergency response robot can run as fast as the fastest man in the world.
[01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:35.793]  In fact, faster.
[01:01:35.793 --> 01:01:38.076]  But of course it's for the military to save you.
[01:01:40.009 --> 01:01:40.770]  I don't think so.
[01:01:58.288 --> 01:02:05.270]  Just another amazing example of how they go out to people like Martha Stewart for a crooked toenail.
[01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.790]  Well, she didn't do anything.
[01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:09.791]  They got her on lying to the feds, though, they claim.
[01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:10.911]  That's why the feds talk to you.
[01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:12.272]  It's like, hey, talk to the hand.
[01:02:12.272 --> 01:02:14.633]  You want to talk to that?
[01:02:14.633 --> 01:02:17.773]  Hey, how's that Fast and Furious going for you over there?
[01:02:17.773 --> 01:02:22.955]  But Shepard Fairey is now admitting that when the AP sued him over the Hope image,
[01:02:23.942 --> 01:02:25.543]  Which he could have probably beat them.
[01:02:25.543 --> 01:02:27.424]  I mean, I know copyright law pretty darn good.
[01:02:27.424 --> 01:02:30.806]  Because he posterized it, changed the color, everything.
[01:02:30.806 --> 01:02:33.847]  I mean, it's almost completely different.
[01:02:33.847 --> 01:02:35.128]  And it's political.
[01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:36.989]  Or they would have gotten a tiny licensing fee.
[01:02:37.947 --> 01:02:42.531]  But instead he went and doctored the stuff that he had come up with it.
[01:02:42.531 --> 01:02:49.196]  And he got caught because all the digital stuff has little back doors, paper printers have date printers on them.
[01:02:49.196 --> 01:02:50.296]  Everything's meant to track you.
[01:02:50.296 --> 01:02:51.998]  Everything's a giant surveillance grid.
[01:02:51.998 --> 01:02:53.699]  And now they're trying to throw him in prison.
[01:02:53.699 --> 01:02:56.101]  Feds seek prison time for Obama hope artists.
[01:02:56.101 --> 01:03:03.066]  Man, I wish the Feds would seek time for their former boss at the Obama administration
[01:03:04.267 --> 01:03:08.634]  On the Economic Council, John Corzine who stole billions and got caught lying to Congress.
[01:03:08.634 --> 01:03:09.996]  Wish you'd go after him.
[01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:12.960]  Wish you'd go after the Solyndra people.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.524]  Wish you'd go after the Chicago Mafia that runs you.
[01:03:15.524 --> 01:03:18.007]  Wish you would go after yourselves.
[01:03:18.007 --> 01:03:20.310]  But oh no, Shepard Fairey.
[01:03:22.351 --> 01:03:35.298]  Federal prosecutors want Shepard Fariot, artist who created the Barack Obama hope poster, to serve time in prison following his misdemeanor conviction for destroying and fabricating documents in connection with the shimmel lawsuit over the iconic campaign.
[01:03:35.298 --> 01:03:39.581]  The guy made $3 million one year, $5 million another, $6 million another.
[01:03:39.581 --> 01:03:42.963]  Of course, now he can't make anything off of it.
[01:03:42.963 --> 01:03:50.227]  But in 07, 08, and 09, 09 was the peak of Obamamania when they were saying he was Christ and stuff, so that's $11 million.
[01:03:53.111 --> 01:03:53.451]  14 million.
[01:03:53.451 --> 01:04:06.375]  He made 14 million dollars, and instead of just fighting the case forever with the Associated Press, he went and fabricated a bunch of stuff.
[01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.615]  He went and fabricated a bunch of stuff.
[01:04:08.615 --> 01:04:15.237]  I mean, obviously, when the Associated Press sues you for millions of dollars, that's not what they're going to get.
[01:04:15.237 --> 01:04:16.397]  Man, people are so ignorant.
[01:04:16.397 --> 01:04:17.378]  But, I mean, what do you expect?
[01:04:17.378 --> 01:04:21.499]  He was an anti, you know, kind of like the
[01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:31.126]  AdBuster people, you know, anti-commercialism, anti-capitalist, communism is rebellion, communism is cool, you know, all this stuff.
[01:04:31.126 --> 01:04:37.069]  And then he has stores all over the country, and all this money, and makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year, gross.
[01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:42.692]  And then he doesn't want to pay somebody, even if he couldn't beat them, because I believe it's his image.
[01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:43.793]  I mean, it's totally different.
[01:04:44.967 --> 01:04:48.171]  So, instead he goes and engages in fraud.
[01:04:48.171 --> 01:04:51.035]  Which is exactly what a communist liberal would do.
[01:04:51.035 --> 01:04:56.301]  They would become filthy rich, and then be so stupid they wouldn't even know how to defend themselves.
[01:04:56.301 --> 01:04:59.525]  And fall into the spider web of the degenerate federal government.
[01:04:59.525 --> 01:04:59.866]  We'll be back.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:11.308]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.
[01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:15.393]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[01:06:01.641 --> 01:06:07.986]  Alex Jones here with a great way to beat the blackouts, get off the grid, and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[01:06:07.986 --> 01:06:13.231]  Folks, with what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it is.
[01:06:13.231 --> 01:06:15.473]  That's in the mainstream news every day.
[01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:22.979]  Millions of people have lost their power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid beyond its capacity.
[01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:27.283]  I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts.
[01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:31.628]  And if you don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you.
[01:06:31.628 --> 01:06:38.016]  Right now, our good friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling Power Hub unit.
[01:06:38.476 --> 01:06:41.518]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make.
[01:06:41.518 --> 01:06:44.640]  It's literally thousands of dollars in savings.
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.363]  Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar-powered.
[01:06:48.363 --> 01:06:51.385]  That means there's no dangerous fumes and no noise.
[01:06:51.385 --> 01:06:56.508]  InfoWars listeners can get all the details at BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:06:56.508 --> 01:06:58.149]  That's BeatTheBlackouts.com.
[01:07:00.407 --> 01:07:06.551]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:09.513]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:07:09.513 --> 01:07:14.896]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:07:14.896 --> 01:07:19.879]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:07:19.879 --> 01:07:27.184]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or meat foods direct now.
[01:07:27.504 --> 01:07:31.367]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:33.168]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:07:33.168 --> 01:07:37.171]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we have all known this was coming.
[01:07:37.171 --> 01:07:40.093]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:07:40.093 --> 01:07:42.875]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today.
[01:07:42.875 --> 01:07:47.438]  And because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:07:47.438 --> 01:07:48.098]  Don't wait!
[01:07:48.098 --> 01:07:49.979]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:07:49.979 --> 01:07:50.119]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:07:55.543 --> 01:07:58.124]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones!
[01:07:58.124 --> 01:07:58.284]  Mother!
[01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:24.066]  Monday through Friday.
[01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:28.069]  11 a.m.
[01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:28.829]  to 2 p.m.
[01:08:28.829 --> 01:08:30.130]  Central.
[01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:35.314]  We're here live.
[01:08:35.314 --> 01:08:42.100]  We are here in an attempt to lift the veil from people's eyes.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.863]  We want people to not live in the darkness of the New World Order.
[01:08:47.185 --> 01:08:56.810]  And we don't run from the darkness, we face it head-on with pleasure, because that is a free human's destiny.
[01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:04.034]  Coming up, DARPA emergency response, it's really a combat robot, runs faster than the fastest human.
[01:09:04.034 --> 01:09:08.297]  It has the world land record now, bipedal attack robots.
[01:09:08.297 --> 01:09:13.239]  The TSA is now responding to us all over the country, saying they've got a test.
[01:09:14.864 --> 01:09:23.908]  Gotta test your drinks after the checkpoint that you buy at Starbucks or at Whataburger or whatever the places they have at the airport because there may be explosives in it.
[01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:28.470]  It's about training you that you're a prisoner, that you're bad, that you're a suspect, and only government's good.
[01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:29.370]  It's a new class system.
[01:09:31.275 --> 01:09:34.779]  And we now have a hoax.
[01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:41.307]  It was later admitted a hoax, just a fake hoax, that there was a liquid bomb on an aircraft from Philadelphia to Dallas and had to turn back.
[01:09:41.307 --> 01:09:45.311]  Just total hoax, but back of the paper hours later, oh yeah, it was a hoax.
[01:09:46.552 --> 01:09:51.893]  But, hey, we need to test, because, you know, the guy might have got a bomb at the coffee shop.
[01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:54.794]  That's what they're saying, and it's going to blow you up with the coffee.
[01:09:54.794 --> 01:09:58.355]  Just right as they're being exposed, that magically happens.
[01:09:58.355 --> 01:10:08.237]  The same TSA worked with the federal government to get the Underwear Bomber on the aircraft two years ago, one week before the rollout of the scanners that had been purchased a year before and were being delivered.
[01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:11.697]  And they said, oh, we're putting these in because of this guy now.
[01:10:11.697 --> 01:10:14.158]  Total lie, totally transparent, in your face.
[01:10:15.168 --> 01:10:21.331]  By the way, I saw police officers at the pool today doing their training and most of them couldn't swim.
[01:10:21.331 --> 01:10:22.452]  By the way, I got footage of that.
[01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.833]  That'll be on the nightly news tonight.
[01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:27.255]  Police officers and cadets.
[01:10:27.255 --> 01:10:29.056]  The trainers could hardly swim.
[01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:32.298]  And then they had the cadets.
[01:10:32.298 --> 01:10:34.059]  A bunch of them were having to be hauled out.
[01:10:34.059 --> 01:10:35.139]  They couldn't swim.
[01:10:35.139 --> 01:10:37.260]  But they'll be pulling me over very soon.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:39.061]  They know how to ride a ticket and make some money.
[01:10:39.061 --> 01:10:41.843]  So we're going to be discussing all of that.
[01:10:41.843 --> 01:10:43.204]  It's pretty amazing footage I got.
[01:10:44.438 --> 01:10:46.039]  We're always on the job.
[01:10:46.039 --> 01:10:48.560]  I'm down there swimming and guys in camo start walking by me.
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.161]  And I'm like, what is this?
[01:10:50.161 --> 01:10:53.043]  And it was the police in camouflage.
[01:10:53.043 --> 01:10:58.926]  They had all their gear and everything and they set it up sort of getting in and they were having to haul guys out who couldn't swim.
[01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:02.928]  So I didn't realize.
[01:11:02.928 --> 01:11:06.089]  A cross sampling of people, you don't have that many people that can't swim.
[01:11:06.089 --> 01:11:06.930]  Something weird is going on.
[01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:17.176]  But they're not letting people with Down Syndrome fly on planes now because it upsets the other passengers if someone sits there quietly drinking a bottle of water.
[01:11:17.176 --> 01:11:23.060]  So I think you might get better officers from what I saw out of someone with Down Syndrome and I'm not joking.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.241]  At least they have more humanity.
[01:11:24.241 --> 01:11:25.141]  Okay, I'm not being mean.
[01:11:25.141 --> 01:11:25.902]  I don't hate police.
[01:11:25.902 --> 01:11:29.044]  It was just shocking and I'm going to talk about it later.
[01:11:29.044 --> 01:11:30.024]  Now, we are joined
[01:11:31.832 --> 01:11:37.094]  By a very interesting lady here on the transmission today.
[01:11:37.094 --> 01:11:40.154]  In fact, I'm looking for her bio.
[01:11:40.154 --> 01:11:42.275]  And she's Lenora Skenazy.
[01:11:42.275 --> 01:11:50.897]  And she is a syndicated columnist, author, and public speaker who delivers lively, hands-on parenting seminars at universities and community centers.
[01:11:50.897 --> 01:11:53.518]  She has spoken to audiences internationally and appeared on Dr. Phil.
[01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:56.966]  And Good Morning America, and many other nightline, you name it.
[01:11:56.966 --> 01:12:08.570]  In addition to founding the Free Range Kids blog, book, and movement, she has written for everyone from the Washington Post to Mad Magazine, and graduated from Yale and Columbia.
[01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:14.512]  She lives in New York City with her husband and two sons, and she thinks children shouldn't just watch television all day.
[01:12:14.512 --> 01:12:16.252]  She's an extremist.
[01:12:16.252 --> 01:12:23.095]  FreeRangeKids.wordpress.com, and of course we had our article, Cops Interrogate Family for Allowing Kids to Play Outside.
[01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:26.037]  Even in backyards now, children are being taken.
[01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:26.978]  You don't do that.
[01:12:26.978 --> 01:12:30.141]  Social services harass mothers for having free-range children.
[01:12:30.141 --> 01:12:36.446]  So in the new country where you can't have backyard gardens, can't have lemonade stands, well pretty soon you won't be able to have more than one kid.
[01:12:36.446 --> 01:12:37.808]  Thank you for coming on, ma'am.
[01:12:37.808 --> 01:12:39.910]  It's a pleasure to be here, Alex.
[01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:40.650]  Thank you.
[01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:41.251]  Good to have you.
[01:12:41.251 --> 01:12:43.753]  Okay, well tell us about this evil movement you're part of.
[01:12:43.753 --> 01:12:46.576]  I mean, you're claiming that once children played outside.
[01:12:46.576 --> 01:12:48.077]  I think that sounds extreme.
[01:12:48.077 --> 01:12:48.978]  Al-Qaeda could get them.
[01:12:49.807 --> 01:12:54.971]  That's right, and in a way Al-Qaeda is, we just call it CPS, Child Protective Services.
[01:12:54.971 --> 01:13:12.402]  What's happening, what I hear about a lot at the Free Range Kids blog is, excuse me, parents who let their children play outside, walk to school, go to the grocery for them, often have neighbors who turn them in, supposedly out of concern for them.
[01:13:12.402 --> 01:13:14.404]  Good Stasi, good people.
[01:13:14.784 --> 01:13:16.806]  Yes, remind me of the KGB.
[01:13:16.806 --> 01:13:26.613]  And what happens, Child Protective Services is obligated to come and check out whether or not these parents really are being negligent or worse, abusive.
[01:13:26.613 --> 01:13:40.162]  And what has happened is that the parents are found wrong by the police or by Child Protective Services for leaving their children in what CPS calls a dangerous situation, which I would call a normal, nice situation.
[01:13:40.162 --> 01:13:41.223]  In fact, less dangerous
[01:13:41.563 --> 01:13:51.891]  And just letting your kids sit inside all day getting fat and diabetic, you let your kids run outside or have some independent adventures, that's considered bad parenting now.
[01:13:51.891 --> 01:14:01.598]  It is so unusual for parents to let their children play outside, climb a tree, that they are being turned in as negligent instead.
[01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:03.660]  And no other culture does this.
[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.864]  I mean, this is completely backwards from everything we do.
[01:14:06.864 --> 01:14:08.426]  This even happens in rural areas.
[01:14:08.426 --> 01:14:12.672]  I've had families, John, who've had their kids taken because they let them play in the backyard.
[01:14:12.672 --> 01:14:16.436]  I'm talking about five and six years old with a fence around them.
[01:14:16.436 --> 01:14:17.558]  That's not even allowed now.
[01:14:18.288 --> 01:14:19.468]  That's incredible.
[01:14:19.468 --> 01:14:22.349]  Here I'm just going to give you a couple of examples.
[01:14:22.349 --> 01:14:26.350]  The one that you wrote about was a mom who has four kids.
[01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:32.972]  They were outside playing in the fields next to her home, not at night with no clothes on.
[01:14:32.972 --> 01:14:36.553]  They were next to her house during the day, sunny Saturday weekend day.
[01:14:37.433 --> 01:14:41.375]  And it was so unusual these days to see any children outside.
[01:14:41.375 --> 01:14:43.556]  The immediate assumption is something's wrong.
[01:14:43.556 --> 01:14:44.376]  They've escaped.
[01:14:44.376 --> 01:14:46.237]  Maybe they've been kidnapped by somebody.
[01:14:46.237 --> 01:14:46.577]  Who knows?
[01:14:46.577 --> 01:14:47.598]  Or could be kidnapped.
[01:14:47.598 --> 01:14:48.919]  That's the big fear.
[01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:53.321]  And so the police were called and then the police had to come and actually do a report.
[01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:56.302]  One person who wrote to me with a similar situation said,
[01:14:56.802 --> 01:14:57.043]  And again!
[01:15:11.459 --> 01:15:17.205]  They then intimidate you into the drug test, getting you into the bureaucratic system, but let's expand on this.
[01:15:17.205 --> 01:15:20.549]  You're coming on my show, you're going to get dozens of emails and calls.
[01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:27.477]  They take kids now, and what's incredible is, even as the Justice Department admits, CPS, you liken to Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:27.477 --> 01:15:30.159]  Al-Qaeda's not half as deadly, statistically.
[01:15:31.371 --> 01:15:33.313]  Hundreds of kids a year die in their custody.
[01:15:33.313 --> 01:15:40.099]  You're five times more likely to be physically abused or die, seven times to be sexually abused in CPS.
[01:15:40.099 --> 01:15:49.907]  So, oh, your kid might get kidnapped, so we're going to come kidnap them with an industry that's even more dangerous than, you know, perverts getting into the priesthood or TSA.
[01:15:49.907 --> 01:15:52.970]  I mean, this is where predators go, is CPS.
[01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:56.413]  So now they actually come kidnap your kid because they might get kidnapped.
[01:15:57.603 --> 01:16:16.499]  I actually think that parents are ending up, in a way, kidnapping their kids, too, because if your fear is so overblown that the minute your kids walk outside, some predator is going to jump on them, because that's exactly what you see on Nancy Grace and CSI, you know, whether it's fiction or not, that's the number one story on television.
[01:16:16.499 --> 01:16:22.004]  You're so afraid of them being kidnapped, it almost seems like the only thing you can do to keep your kids safe
[01:16:22.404 --> 01:16:26.146]  Is to keep them inside where they're going to the refrigerator and they're watching TV.
[01:16:26.146 --> 01:16:27.247]  This is a great example.
[01:16:27.247 --> 01:16:29.168]  I know you have the statistics on your excellent site.
[01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.769]  I mean, if you have them in front of you, go over some of that.
[01:16:30.769 --> 01:16:35.531]  But kidnapping is actually flat or gone down compared to what it was.
[01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:42.135]  But they make such a big deal, just like with terrorism, that it creates the perception that there are kidnappers around every corner.
[01:16:42.796 --> 01:16:43.056]  Right.
[01:16:43.056 --> 01:16:48.182]  It's same as like, you know, you don't report on the millions of children who went safely to school today.
[01:16:48.182 --> 01:16:50.024]  You report on the one child.
[01:16:50.024 --> 01:16:54.710]  Perhaps it's the anniversary of a child 30 years ago who didn't get to school.
[01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:57.533]  But there's always that one story that the media can find.
[01:16:57.893 --> 01:17:03.294]  And put in front of our faces, and then our brains put it in the file system, which is like Google.
[01:17:03.294 --> 01:17:06.735]  If you ask yourself, gee, can my kid walk to school?
[01:17:06.735 --> 01:17:10.136]  I actually got that question today to a lady writing to my site.
[01:17:10.136 --> 01:17:11.556]  Can my child walk to school?
[01:17:11.556 --> 01:17:13.256]  The principal says it's too dangerous.
[01:17:13.256 --> 01:17:16.817]  I can see the school from my house, but the principal says no.
[01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:19.158]  They're turning everything into a prison.
[01:17:19.158 --> 01:17:21.678]  I mean, it's very simple.
[01:17:21.678 --> 01:17:25.499]  The schools are prisons, and the nanny state is the prison.
[01:17:26.823 --> 01:17:38.428]  Well, it does seem completely prison-like to say that you must drive your child or sometimes walk your child to school as if, you know, it's like walking across the yard.
[01:17:38.428 --> 01:17:41.750]  Or put them on the school bus where they get beat up, but let's expand on that.
[01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:44.231]  I don't think the school bus is that dangerous.
[01:17:44.231 --> 01:18:02.523]  I think what's really crazy is when people are all driving their children individually to school, wasting the gas, worrying about bullies, teaching them not how to get to school on their own, not to enjoy nature, but the only place you're safe is in an enclosed space, sometimes the SUV, with your parents, and then deposited at school.
[01:18:02.523 --> 01:18:05.144]  I'll tell you, the best thing that ever happened to me was bullies.
[01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:06.165]  That made me the person I am.
[01:18:06.165 --> 01:18:07.145]  I love it.
[01:18:07.145 --> 01:18:09.507]  I mean, children have to learn to have some adventures.
[01:18:10.327 --> 01:18:26.578]  Adventures is true, and also, while you don't want to, you know, encourage any horrible bullying, bullying has been defined downward, dumbed down to the point where some schools have a list of things that define bullying, and one of them is rolling your eyes at a kid.
[01:18:26.578 --> 01:18:27.098]  Come on.
[01:18:27.098 --> 01:18:28.299]  Oh, but here's the deal.
[01:18:28.299 --> 01:18:32.282]  When you learn how to face bullies, then you know how to deal with them later in life.
[01:18:32.282 --> 01:18:36.705]  They don't want us knowing how to face bullies because the government acts like bullies.
[01:18:36.705 --> 01:18:37.845]  They want us to be cowards.
[01:18:37.845 --> 01:18:40.127]  When I see bullies now, I know how to deal with them.
[01:18:41.248 --> 01:19:01.005]  I'm glad you do and I do believe that kids are a lot stronger and more resilient than we give them credit for and when we think that they can't handle anything that's when we say no you can't walk to school no you can't roll your eyes remember that story a couple days ago the three-year-old whose name is Hunter but he's deaf did you hear about this oh he can't point his finger now
[01:19:02.026 --> 01:19:04.587]  He can't make the sign for his name, which is Hunter.
[01:19:04.587 --> 01:19:07.048]  This is Hunter, and this means it's a name.
[01:19:07.048 --> 01:19:13.751]  But that is too scary at the deaf school for preschoolers that he's going to because it indicates a gun.
[01:19:13.751 --> 01:19:18.413]  And somehow that gets conflated with somebody bringing an actual Uzi in to the school.
[01:19:18.413 --> 01:19:20.914]  No, they're putting us into a total mental illness.
[01:19:20.914 --> 01:19:27.817]  They're making people mentally ill in basket cases and trying to artificially invoke and create artificial agoraphobia.
[01:19:28.835 --> 01:19:31.336]  Exactly, especially where it concerns kids.
[01:19:31.336 --> 01:19:49.021]  You know, when we were talking about this case today with the mother who had her four children outside who was visited by the police, recently there was a man who let his two kids, nine and I think six or seven, play in a park and he was arrested because he had left them there for almost two hours and that was considered negligent.
[01:19:49.021 --> 01:19:57.064]  I think that's considered believing in your kids, believing in your community, and believing that you're a smart enough parent that you've taught them, don't go off with strangers.
[01:19:57.064 --> 01:19:57.804]  Unbelievable!
[01:19:57.984 --> 01:20:00.026]  Absolutely, then they get no street smarts.
[01:20:00.026 --> 01:20:01.607]  We'll be right back.

[01:21:03.788 --> 01:21:08.250]  Did you know that a solar storm in 1989 caused an enormous blackout in Quebec?

[01:24:12.466 --> 01:24:15.250]  Well, Lenore Scanese is an impressive lady.
[01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.392]  Just get a chance to talk to her.

[01:24:19.876 --> 01:24:22.019]  We can really get into detail.
[01:24:22.019 --> 01:24:24.663]  But freerangekids.wordpress.com.
[01:24:24.663 --> 01:24:26.085]  She's having a big effect too.
[01:24:27.039 --> 01:24:28.319]  You're pointing out that we're prisoners.
[01:24:28.319 --> 01:24:32.520]  You drive through neighborhoods now, or you're up in a high-rise building looking at other people's condos.
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:35.181]  I'm at a party or something, and everything's glowing blue.
[01:24:35.181 --> 01:24:36.941]  No one's talking.
[01:24:36.941 --> 01:24:38.762]  My friend had a telescope, and I said, what are you seeing?
[01:24:38.762 --> 01:24:40.702]  He goes, people watching television.
[01:24:40.702 --> 01:24:46.243]  Just 50 years ago, folks, you saw people playing chess, people fighting, people having sex.
[01:24:46.243 --> 01:24:48.904]  Because I've read books about how the culture's changed.
[01:24:48.904 --> 01:24:50.904]  You would see everything with a telescope.
[01:24:50.904 --> 01:24:52.725]  Now you see people watching television.
[01:24:52.725 --> 01:24:53.785]  It's killing our culture.
[01:24:54.625 --> 01:24:58.767]  Now, in just 50 years, it's evil to have your kids out in public.
[01:24:58.767 --> 01:25:01.929]  I've seen cases where an 11-year-old throws a fit.
[01:25:01.929 --> 01:25:04.831]  Mom kicks him out of the car a mile from home, makes him walk.
[01:25:04.831 --> 01:25:10.274]  My mother would kick me out of the car five miles from home if I was not doing what she said.
[01:25:10.274 --> 01:25:14.176]  I mean, obviously, she wouldn't do it in South Dallas.
[01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:19.700]  I mean, I can see the poor kids that are locked up in war zones, but, I mean, we lived in an affluent, middle-class neighborhood.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:21.040]  They're now arresting people.
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.542]  Please continue with some of the other key points.
[01:25:26.283 --> 01:25:43.272]  And now is that people are doing exactly what you say they're keeping their kids inside and and I point out like the South Dallas idea it's if your kids are in a terrible neighborhood and there's no alternative to keep them safe keep them inside but if you move to a neighborhood because you liked the neighborhood
[01:25:44.093 --> 01:25:45.574]  Why are you keeping them inside?
[01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:54.184]  You're acting as if you're in a war zone when you have the privilege of letting your kids go outside, but it is so rare that I don't know if you know about my holiday.
[01:25:54.184 --> 01:25:58.929]  It's been celebrated for three years now called Take Our Children to the Park and Leave Them There Day.
[01:25:58.929 --> 01:26:01.452]  Alex, did you hear about that holiday ever?
[01:26:02.564 --> 01:26:05.727]  Actually, I read about it on your site, and that's what we need.
[01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:12.413]  My dad, by the time he was 8 or 9 years old, would be put on the bus by himself, put on planes.
[01:26:12.413 --> 01:26:15.976]  You know, I was when I was like 4 or 5 years old, sent to family.
[01:26:15.976 --> 01:26:21.782]  And he would get down there, and by the time he was like 12, he would go and work for the summer in Houston.
[01:26:22.264 --> 01:26:23.285]  That's incredible.
[01:26:23.285 --> 01:26:36.516]  Yeah, because back then, I mean, not that I want to see child labor resurging in any bad way, but at least we thought that kids were competent and could add something to society as opposed to us just giving them and doing for them.
[01:26:36.516 --> 01:26:38.177]  All it does is arrest development.
[01:26:38.177 --> 01:26:43.402]  I watched police cadets today who literally, it was like they had lobotomies.
[01:26:43.402 --> 01:26:48.326]  They couldn't swim, they couldn't talk, and this is what we've turned the public into is these jellyfish.
[01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:54.747]  Right, and the idea is that you're being a good parent because you're hovering over them and you're keeping them from harm.
[01:26:54.747 --> 01:26:58.551]  But really, the message they're getting is, I can't do anything without my parents.
[01:26:58.551 --> 01:27:12.445]  Parents wait at the bus stop with their children in the mornings and make sure that they get on the bus, as if it's so dangerous to be there with three other kids waiting for the bus, as if they can't get on the bus, as if there's some danger between the bus stop and the bus.
[01:27:12.945 --> 01:27:19.287]  And the message kids are getting is, I'm in constant danger and if my parents aren't here, something bad will happen to me.
[01:27:19.287 --> 01:27:24.208]  Thank goodness there's somebody smart and big to care about no matter what.
[01:27:24.208 --> 01:27:38.612]  Listen, this morning, I mean, I took my children swimming, it didn't happen today, but I'll have my four-year-old, who swims great, in like three foot of water, swimming, you know, twenty feet away from me, and people will come over and say, you need to do something.
[01:27:38.612 --> 01:27:40.353]  And these are adults that can hardly swim.
[01:27:40.353 --> 01:27:40.993]  I'm like, listen!
[01:27:41.693 --> 01:27:43.965]  There's lifeguards here and she knows how to swim!
[01:27:43.965 --> 01:27:44.950]  She can swim better than you!
[01:27:46.147 --> 01:27:46.447]  Right.
[01:27:46.447 --> 01:27:54.891]  I think that actually what Free Range Kids says is that our job as parents isn't to do everything for the kid, isn't to hold your kid up in the pool.
[01:27:54.891 --> 01:27:58.812]  It's to teach them the skills they need to be safe and independent.
[01:27:58.812 --> 01:28:01.373]  And one of them really is teaching your children how to swim.
[01:28:01.373 --> 01:28:03.554]  Teach your children not to go off with strangers.
[01:28:03.554 --> 01:28:08.476]  Teach your children how to cross the street safely because you're not going to be there with them every minute.
[01:28:08.476 --> 01:28:14.559]  And the idea that you should be is really treating kids as the lowest common denominator generation ever seen.
[01:28:14.779 --> 01:28:16.719]  Well, look, let's be honest about it.
[01:28:16.719 --> 01:28:28.002]  Everything that happened to black communities in the last hundred years has now been exported everywhere, where they put people in these compact cities, these reservations, just like Native American reservations were really prisoner of war camps.
[01:28:28.002 --> 01:28:37.104]  And they get them to the point now where everything I saw growing up in inner city neighborhoods, because I had friends in the inner city, where they were scared to go out, didn't know how to do anything, didn't know how to swim.
[01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:38.304]  That's now everybody.
[01:28:38.744 --> 01:28:42.206]  Everybody is now, it's like weird if you know how to do something.
[01:28:42.206 --> 01:28:44.307]  It's weird if you're not scared.
[01:28:44.307 --> 01:28:46.527]  We're becoming prisoners who don't know what to do.
[01:28:46.527 --> 01:28:48.728]  We need to be locked up and unlocked.
[01:28:48.728 --> 01:28:49.649]  That's our new culture.
[01:28:50.649 --> 01:28:54.051]  It's interesting that you think of it as sort of ghetto culture.
[01:28:54.051 --> 01:29:02.635]  I think of it, for me, what resonates is the idea that we are treating children the way we treated women in the 1950s and early 60s.
[01:29:02.635 --> 01:29:04.396]  Telling them, you can't leave the house.
[01:29:04.396 --> 01:29:05.457]  You have everything here.
[01:29:05.457 --> 01:29:08.198]  You should be happy with all the... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:29:08.198 --> 01:29:08.778]  Exactly.
[01:29:08.778 --> 01:29:13.041]  That's the mode of social control they did to black folks and people and women.
[01:29:13.041 --> 01:29:13.861]  I agree with you.
[01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:15.562]  It's now being exported onto everybody.
[01:29:16.385 --> 01:29:18.067]  Right, as if nothing is safe.
[01:29:18.067 --> 01:29:22.532]  And then, of course, if you have a group of people who doesn't believe anything is safe, you can sell them anything.
[01:29:22.532 --> 01:29:24.714]  You can sell them tracking devices for their children.
[01:29:24.714 --> 01:29:28.318]  You can sell them a screaming backpack, which I just found out about.
[01:29:28.318 --> 01:29:34.905]  Did you know that there's a child carrier, you know, like that you put on your back, and the kid can hang on to your shoulders and sort of be strapped in?
[01:29:34.905 --> 01:29:37.768]  That's good for children up to age 7?
[01:29:39.352 --> 01:29:41.233]  Now the children can't walk.
[01:29:41.233 --> 01:29:45.715]  I predicted that, that soon tying your shoelaces will mean you get the Pulitzer Prize.
[01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:46.435]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:46.435 --> 01:29:47.716]  We'll have you on next week.
[01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:48.916]  Amazing information.
[01:29:48.916 --> 01:29:50.477]  FreeRangeKids.wordpress.com.
[01:29:50.477 --> 01:29:51.878]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.878 --> 01:29:54.399]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.399 --> 01:29:57.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:00.729 --> 01:31:06.230]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:08.631]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:14.352]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure.
[01:31:14.352 --> 01:31:17.733]  And it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:17.733 --> 01:31:21.193]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[01:31:21.193 --> 01:31:22.854]  There's no priming required.
[01:31:22.854 --> 01:31:25.134]  It's NSF-42 certified.
[01:31:25.134 --> 01:31:27.655]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[01:31:28.715 --> 01:31:30.236]  Easy to set up and use.
[01:31:30.236 --> 01:31:31.657]  Doesn't require electricity.
[01:31:31.657 --> 01:31:34.819]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[01:31:34.819 --> 01:31:38.201]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:40.122]  Save money by not buying bottled water.
[01:31:40.122 --> 01:31:42.363]  And avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:45.085]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:31:45.085 --> 01:31:46.666]  It's what my family uses.
[01:31:46.666 --> 01:31:49.968]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[01:31:49.968 --> 01:31:55.231]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.

[01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:01.875]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:32:01.875 --> 01:32:07.458]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:32:07.458 --> 01:32:12.481]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:12.481 --> 01:32:17.524]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:32:18.044 --> 01:32:23.267]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:32:23.267 --> 01:32:25.589]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:32:25.589 --> 01:32:30.392]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:30.392 --> 01:32:31.513]  And here's the best part.
[01:32:31.513 --> 01:32:34.595]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:32:34.595 --> 01:32:37.877]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:32:38.197 --> 01:32:41.378]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:41.378 --> 01:32:43.599]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:32:43.599 --> 01:32:44.540]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:44.740]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.181]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:32:48.181 --> 01:32:49.922]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:31.964]  Coming up at the start of the next hour, ladies and gentlemen, again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:31.964 --> 01:33:32.684]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:32.684 --> 01:33:44.375]  We're going to have for one segment the head editor over at the M4 Wars magazine, Russell Dowden, in studio with us.
[01:33:44.375 --> 01:33:49.259]  The NSA in front of everybody back there, six people in his big office.
[01:33:49.259 --> 01:33:50.721]  They're all in one big room.
[01:33:50.721 --> 01:33:51.622]  He gets a call.
[01:33:53.710 --> 01:33:58.956]  And nobody talks, so he calls it back and they say, hello, National Security Agency.
[01:33:58.956 --> 01:34:00.458]  And he checks the number, all of it.
[01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:03.501]  But guys, ahead of him coming, we've got to do this due diligence again.
[01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:10.849]  We were supposed to get a photo of that, have it ready so we can show the photo of his phone with the number so everybody can use it.
[01:34:10.849 --> 01:34:13.211]  And we need to call that number again right now.
[01:34:13.832 --> 01:34:17.974]  And we need to check it like I did on the web, just double check that it is the NSA number.
[01:34:17.974 --> 01:34:25.899]  So I want to put that number in the computer, check it again, double check it that it's the PR number of the National Security Agency.
[01:34:25.899 --> 01:34:27.120]  Because this is a news issue.
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:32.503]  Because I would get these calls ten years ago and call back and then they would answer National Security Agency.
[01:34:32.503 --> 01:34:34.204]  And it's a form of harassment.
[01:34:34.204 --> 01:34:37.786]  And then if you don't get the message, then they call up and tell you what you're talking about.
[01:34:38.689 --> 01:34:41.131]  On an unlisted number.
[01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:42.993]  And, you know, oh, you got family in the hospital.
[01:34:42.993 --> 01:34:44.414]  I hope they don't do too good.
[01:34:44.414 --> 01:34:46.256]  Just heard you talking to your family.
[01:34:46.256 --> 01:34:53.022]  So that's the kind of... I mean, I've had crew see this happen when my wife calls up crying and they've done it to her.
[01:34:53.022 --> 01:34:55.444]  OK, I mean, this is the type of stuff they do.
[01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:57.126]  This is what our country has become.
[01:34:57.126 --> 01:35:02.791]  This has happened everywhere else where you let government get too big and you start bowing down to it and just saying it's your God.
[01:35:03.936 --> 01:35:11.239]  We're going to be talking about this and my crew that went down, three of our crew members, three reporters, but to John Bell on camera in just a moment.
[01:35:11.239 --> 01:35:18.522]  Before we go any further, remember, freedom is not free and we are risking our lives to bring you this information.
[01:35:18.522 --> 01:35:20.763]  We are doing everything we can.
[01:35:21.423 --> 01:35:22.884]  To expose the globalists.
[01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:23.685]  We are.
[01:35:23.685 --> 01:35:25.606]  I have hired six new reporters.
[01:35:25.606 --> 01:35:31.671]  I have hired seven graphics people and writers and editors for the magazine, the websites.
[01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:35.594]  I just hired another writer on top of that, so I guess that's eight.
[01:35:35.594 --> 01:35:38.516]  I am expending our capital because it's all starting to come down.
[01:35:39.036 --> 01:35:42.818]  And so I'm doing everything I can, so later I won't wish that I'd done more.
[01:35:42.818 --> 01:35:44.239]  You know the Braveheart speech?
[01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:53.063]  What would you do many years from now, lying in your beds, to just once, just once say, you can take our lives, but you'll never take our freedom!
[01:35:53.063 --> 01:35:54.584]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:35:54.584 --> 01:35:55.904]  And this isn't your life.
[01:35:55.904 --> 01:36:00.267]  If you won't fight in the info war today to get the word out, you'll never fight with a sword.
[01:36:00.267 --> 01:36:01.887]  That's a cop-out.
[01:36:01.887 --> 01:36:06.770]  You need to reach out to the millions of the system, and I'll tell you, on average, they're about as dumb as a box of rocks.
[01:36:07.503 --> 01:36:09.706]  And I'm talking about bureaucrats, all of them.
[01:36:09.706 --> 01:36:13.470]  Of minions, police generally are smarter because they live in the real world.
[01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:14.972]  Firefighters are great people.
[01:36:14.972 --> 01:36:16.834]  So I'm not saying the government's the enemy.
[01:36:16.834 --> 01:36:27.106]  The criminals that have seized it and are trying to direct it in a draconian, anti-American, anti-liberty, anti-freedom way must be exposed in the endfall war.
[01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:34.404]  So you can spread the word about the broadcast, spread the word about our free podcast, the audio streams, our local affiliates, if you're listening on local stations.
[01:36:34.404 --> 01:36:37.444]  You can purchase the books, the videos, the t-shirts, the ball caps.
[01:36:37.444 --> 01:36:41.826]  It takes over five and a half million dollars a year to run this operation now.
[01:36:41.826 --> 01:36:47.767]  Most people, and believe me, I could probably make almost that much money with like six people here, but not reach as many people.
[01:36:47.767 --> 01:36:50.808]  So I could sit here and, you know, make
[01:36:51.388 --> 01:36:57.631]  You know, Glenn Beck type money, if I wanted to sell out the system right now, or if I just wanted to cut back what I'm doing.
[01:36:57.631 --> 01:37:05.015]  I'm taking the majority, the vast majority, 90 plus percent of the money, and putting it right back into this operation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:05.015 --> 01:37:12.218]  And then, of course, putting some back so we can be strong for frivolous whatever happens down the roads, lawsuits, attacks, fake criminal charges.
[01:37:12.218 --> 01:37:15.059]  We've got backup plans, because we have a different mission.
[01:37:15.059 --> 01:37:15.940]  It's not make money.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.143]  Our mission is fight the globalists, but we need the money.
[01:37:19.143 --> 01:37:24.149]  So in mid-air refueling, as I call it, on air, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:26.231]  InfoWarsShop.com takes you to the same place.

[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:33.940]  Buy...
[01:37:34.841 --> 01:37:37.845]  The Pro-Pure super high quality stainless steel gravity filters.

[01:37:39.548 --> 01:37:41.230]  10% off.
[01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:43.693]  Nobody's got that price with promo code WATER.
[01:37:43.693 --> 01:37:45.576]  That purchase is something you need.
[01:37:45.576 --> 01:37:47.218]  It's a great deal and it supports us.
[01:37:48.217 --> 01:37:49.738]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:49.738 --> 01:37:54.660]  You're doing so much when you come and vote with your dollars and by spreading the word.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.040]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:08.185]  When you bought out 36,000 copies at cost of the new magazine, 50,000 on the streets of Austin, 40,000 I printed, 4,000 held back for when we start subscriptions next month, so you get the first issue plus the next 12.
[01:38:09.554 --> 01:38:10.335]  That's just amazing.
[01:38:10.335 --> 01:38:11.095]  Sold out of those.
[01:38:11.095 --> 01:38:14.397]  And a few places refused them, so we still have a few left there on the site.
[01:38:14.397 --> 01:38:19.901]  But the point is, is that I increased the prices, actually sold them for too little and then lost money.
[01:38:19.901 --> 01:38:25.585]  So now I'm selling them for like $3 a piece instead of, you know, less than a dollar a piece like I was, because I ended up losing money.
[01:38:25.585 --> 01:38:27.006]  So there's a few of those.
[01:38:27.006 --> 01:38:27.427]  September.
[01:38:28.027 --> 01:38:28.267]  I think?
[01:38:48.894 --> 01:38:50.875]  Spread the word about the websites.
[01:38:50.875 --> 01:38:53.136]  Spread the word about the information.
[01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:54.577]  I know we can beat these people.
[01:38:54.577 --> 01:38:56.218]  We've beaten tyrants before.
[01:38:56.218 --> 01:39:00.980]  We will defeat them if we absolutely go up against them and call them out for what they are.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.920]  Okay?
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.462]  You think it intimidates me when the NSA calls up?
[01:39:04.462 --> 01:39:04.902]  I love it.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:09.263]  Okay, if they strike me down in the fight against tyranny, it means I did a good job.
[01:39:09.263 --> 01:39:13.047]  I don't want to die, but I don't want them to win and enslave us.
[01:39:13.047 --> 01:39:24.196]  And it's that commitment, that spiritual decision to set your weight, spiritually, mentally, physically, intellectually, economically, against the enemy that will bring them down!
[01:39:24.196 --> 01:39:32.464]  We will bring them down, but it's up to you to support us at InfoWarsTore.com and also become sponsors of our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:39:32.464 --> 01:39:32.704]  Okay.
[01:39:34.008 --> 01:39:41.510]  Now, shifting gears here, we have John Bowne, he's been with us for a year, done a great job, formerly worked at a local TV station here, and in radio before that.
[01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:49.793]  And we have Linda West, who has now been there for about a week, or less, and already hit the ground running, writing articles, doing reports, man on the street coming out, you name it.
[01:39:51.013 --> 01:39:53.894]  She's worked in TV, radio, print, run newspapers.
[01:39:53.894 --> 01:39:57.115]  She's now part of the team, just amazing team.
[01:39:57.115 --> 01:39:58.976]  We now have six new reporters here.
[01:39:58.976 --> 01:40:00.416]  Well, one of them's coming in a few weeks.
[01:40:00.416 --> 01:40:05.038]  So we have five new reporters on top of the three or four we've got, all because of you supporting us, okay?
[01:40:05.038 --> 01:40:06.118]  Thank you so much.
[01:40:06.118 --> 01:40:08.359]  So we can get more stories, more reports.
[01:40:08.359 --> 01:40:12.881]  I'm so sick of not being able to cover everything in detail I want, and it just becomes a scatterbrained event.
[01:40:14.482 --> 01:40:19.407]  We are expanding in the face of the globalists, in the face of their takeover, in the face of their attacks.
[01:40:19.407 --> 01:40:24.492]  And others, the inventor of the internet, not Al Gore, has come out and said it's a total tyranny we're facing.
[01:40:24.492 --> 01:40:28.296]  Others are recognizing that we've been right and that yes, it's happening.
[01:40:28.296 --> 01:40:30.238]  We've got a good chance of turning this around.
[01:40:30.919 --> 01:40:44.943]  They wanted to go down and talk about the TSA and the national story that we're in AP, Reuters, CBS News about our report about them dipping the, you know, testers in coffee and food you buy past the checkpoint.
[01:40:44.943 --> 01:40:46.024]  They politely show up.
[01:40:46.024 --> 01:40:47.144]  They all know who we are.
[01:40:47.144 --> 01:40:50.245]  And they freak out.
[01:40:50.245 --> 01:40:51.686]  The police come over.
[01:40:51.686 --> 01:40:52.906]  You know, they say, don't leave.
[01:40:52.906 --> 01:40:53.726]  Well, am I detained?
[01:40:53.726 --> 01:40:56.467]  No, but don't leave the TSA goons.
[01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:58.508]  All of this like we're bad to have cameras.
[01:40:58.508 --> 01:40:59.008]  And here's the deal.
[01:41:00.114 --> 01:41:03.175]  They're arresting people nationwide for owning guns.
[01:41:03.175 --> 01:41:04.736]  Okay?
[01:41:04.736 --> 01:41:13.739]  They're arresting people nationwide for owning guns and things, which aren't even illegal, that people are now open carrying to exercise that right.
[01:41:13.739 --> 01:41:15.020]  It's the same thing with cameras.
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:18.461]  They're arresting people nationwide for filming police in public areas.
[01:41:18.461 --> 01:41:21.402]  People have to counter that with lawsuits and speech and all of it.
[01:41:21.402 --> 01:41:22.763]  They're going to take our basic rights.
[01:41:22.763 --> 01:41:24.283]  They're trying to.
[01:41:24.283 --> 01:41:25.644]  They are becoming tyrannical.
[01:41:26.857 --> 01:41:30.621]  And just because they're wearing a uniform doesn't mean they're God, folks.
[01:41:30.621 --> 01:41:32.362]  This is how North Korea fell.
[01:41:32.362 --> 01:41:34.424]  This is how all the other countries went into darkness.
[01:41:34.424 --> 01:41:35.605]  Guys, great job.
[01:41:35.605 --> 01:41:40.791]  Dan Bodondi's a big part of this, but he's in there running the show right now.
[01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:42.272]  John Bowne first, then Linda West.
[01:41:42.272 --> 01:41:45.015]  Give us a breakdown of what you witnessed and what we're about to see in this video.
[01:41:45.711 --> 01:41:57.717]  Well, we basically went over to the airport to get a bird's eye view of the airport because, you know, everyone has their own qualms about going to the airport and talking to people that work there because it's so scary there.
[01:41:57.717 --> 01:42:00.878]  But, I've had it.
[01:42:00.878 --> 01:42:01.999]  I'm done.
[01:42:01.999 --> 01:42:08.882]  I'm tired of the New World Order pushing the agenda of my life around.
[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:10.961]  I'm done with it.
[01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:12.804]  So I said, let's just go upstairs.
[01:42:12.804 --> 01:42:14.186]  Let's confront the dragon.
[01:42:14.186 --> 01:42:15.568]  Let's go talk to the TSA.
[01:42:15.568 --> 01:42:16.389]  Oh my gosh.
[01:42:16.389 --> 01:42:17.431]  Oh, so evil of that.
[01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:18.652]  Talking to our God?
[01:42:18.652 --> 01:42:19.974]  Yeah.
[01:42:19.974 --> 01:42:22.898]  Well, and I brought this vampire killer thing with me.
[01:42:22.898 --> 01:42:24.020]  It's called the Bill of Rights.
[01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:31.449]  And the Constitution, and Dan Bodondi, the vampire killer, wielding it, as you'll see in the video.
[01:42:31.449 --> 01:42:36.936]  But when you show the Bill of Rights to somebody... The cop actually recoiled!
[01:42:36.936 --> 01:42:38.558]  He like looked at it like, oh!
[01:42:38.558 --> 01:42:39.900]  They teach him to stand for it now.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:43.463]  Well, it's like shoving a vampire into the noonday sun.
[01:42:43.463 --> 01:42:49.247]  They're like, well, maybe that's right, but wait, I got all this power.
[01:42:49.247 --> 01:42:51.089]  Well, let me get a hold of my power.
[01:42:51.089 --> 01:42:52.590]  Hang on, let me check.
[01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:53.971]  You know, I got a gun.
[01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:56.593]  Call some people and check on my power.
[01:42:56.593 --> 01:42:58.534]  And there's some terrorists in the area.
[01:42:58.534 --> 01:42:59.615]  We just had it.
[01:42:59.615 --> 01:43:05.420]  We just throw them in the Infowars blender and we all just went off on the DHS, the Homeland Security media rep.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:06.420]  Well, they're not even police.
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.281]  They have no training.
[01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:08.102]  Who are these people?
[01:43:08.957 --> 01:43:10.358]  Well, they had an eight-hour course.
[01:43:10.358 --> 01:43:12.139]  They can read your mind.
[01:43:12.139 --> 01:43:12.620]  Good.
[01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:15.302]  Hey, Linda, tell us your take on this.
[01:43:15.302 --> 01:43:22.907]  Well, you know, after that story came out about the LAPD going after people that take pictures in the airport, of course we said... Well, it wasn't even in the airport.
[01:43:22.907 --> 01:43:23.667]  They're now on the streets.
[01:43:23.667 --> 01:43:24.268]  They're grabbing them.
[01:43:24.268 --> 01:43:24.948]  I know, on the streets.
[01:43:24.948 --> 01:43:30.252]  But when I called the commanding officer, he said, in particular, you'll get arrested if you videotape at the airport.
[01:43:30.672 --> 01:43:31.873]  But there's no law.
[01:43:31.873 --> 01:43:32.633]  Right, there's no law.
[01:43:32.633 --> 01:43:33.253]  As you said, there's no law.
[01:43:33.253 --> 01:43:33.754]  You can look it up.
[01:43:33.754 --> 01:43:35.735]  It's just they're false arresting.
[01:43:35.735 --> 01:43:36.935]  They're disappearing people.
[01:43:36.935 --> 01:43:37.696]  It's fear.
[01:43:37.696 --> 01:43:39.257]  They're trying to get us with fear.
[01:43:39.257 --> 01:43:41.378]  And the answer is no, bully, no.
[01:43:41.378 --> 01:43:42.058]  That's right.
[01:43:42.058 --> 01:43:43.078]  That's right, Alex.
[01:43:43.078 --> 01:43:49.382]  And so we said, well, of course, well, let's go down to the airport then because they haven't made that law yet in Austin.
[01:43:49.382 --> 01:43:52.923]  So we got down there and everybody was kind of up in arms.
[01:43:52.923 --> 01:43:56.305]  The TSA guys kept walking by and I kept saying, oh, can I have a comment?
[01:43:56.305 --> 01:43:58.006]  And they're like, no, no, no, we can't talk to you.
[01:43:58.006 --> 01:43:59.307]  I'm like, well, why can't you talk to me?
[01:43:59.307 --> 01:43:59.787]  What do you mean?
[01:43:59.867 --> 01:44:00.448]  You can't talk to me.
[01:44:00.448 --> 01:44:01.609]  You're a slave!
[01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:04.051]  Yeah, it's like... Well, talk to American scum!
[01:44:04.051 --> 01:44:05.552]  Pay my paycheck!
[01:44:05.552 --> 01:44:08.776]  Pay the security fees, scum American!
[01:44:08.776 --> 01:44:10.537]  Get over here for a grope!
[01:44:10.537 --> 01:44:12.699]  They're probably like, we'll get you guys next time.
[01:44:12.699 --> 01:44:22.328]  Yeah, yeah, she's like, hey, you know, last time I was here, I went through the airport, I got groped, and this is a tyrannical area... You're supposed to lay down to that, though!
[01:44:22.328 --> 01:44:25.031]  The guy's like, I don't think... I think this is a great place...
[01:44:25.231 --> 01:44:26.072]  Yeah, I like it.
[01:44:26.072 --> 01:44:28.574]  I almost said, hey, have you had your groping today?
[01:44:28.574 --> 01:44:30.455]  You want one?
[01:44:30.455 --> 01:44:32.977]  I mean, you'll see in the video.
[01:44:32.977 --> 01:44:34.038]  I'm done.
[01:44:34.038 --> 01:44:34.418]  I'm done.
[01:44:34.418 --> 01:44:35.659]  Linda, anything else?
[01:44:35.659 --> 01:44:36.940]  Yeah, oh, then they all come over.
[01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:38.741]  First they're like, well, we've got to get the manager.
[01:44:38.741 --> 01:44:39.342]  I'm like, OK.
[01:44:39.342 --> 01:44:41.103]  And then the manager comes walking over.
[01:44:41.103 --> 01:44:45.766]  And that was the best part, because he comes over and he's trying to be all fear-inducing.
[01:44:45.766 --> 01:44:46.287]  And we're just like.
[01:44:46.687 --> 01:44:47.288]  What's wrong?
[01:44:47.288 --> 01:44:48.909]  Well, they are now at the DNC.
[01:44:48.909 --> 01:44:57.216]  Peaceful protesters are being arrested and they're calling protesting, before they even get out of their car, low-level terrorism and say, oh, hold them because we put them on a list.
[01:44:57.216 --> 01:44:57.956]  That's the new thing.
[01:44:57.956 --> 01:44:58.557]  I'm government.
[01:44:58.557 --> 01:44:58.937]  I'm God.
[01:44:58.937 --> 01:44:59.437]  You're on a list.
[01:44:59.437 --> 01:45:00.458]  Your property's mine.
[01:45:00.458 --> 01:45:01.459]  Your kids are mine.
[01:45:01.459 --> 01:45:02.180]  I'm God.
[01:45:02.180 --> 01:45:03.161]  I'm Kim Jong-il.
[01:45:03.161 --> 01:45:04.542]  And I'm like, no, you're not!
[01:45:04.542 --> 01:45:05.362]  No, you're not!
[01:45:05.362 --> 01:45:05.983]  No, you're not!
[01:45:06.343 --> 01:45:07.224]  Right to Assembly.
[01:45:07.224 --> 01:45:08.144]  First Amendment.
[01:45:08.144 --> 01:45:10.286]  Hey, anybody read anymore?
[01:45:10.286 --> 01:45:11.787]  Everybody ever heard of George Washington?
[01:45:11.787 --> 01:45:12.607]  Stick it!
[01:45:12.607 --> 01:45:13.128]  Stick it!
[01:45:13.128 --> 01:45:13.608]  You got it?
[01:45:13.608 --> 01:45:14.749]  We're America!
[01:45:14.749 --> 01:45:15.349]  Not you!
[01:45:15.349 --> 01:45:17.591]  Let's go ahead and go to the report.
[01:45:17.591 --> 01:45:18.051]  Here it is.
[01:45:18.051 --> 01:45:22.074]  Okay, well, I'll go to that exciting report.
[01:45:22.074 --> 01:45:23.315]  Nice to meet you.
[01:45:23.315 --> 01:45:25.776]  I'm, uh... I don't want this on right now.
[01:45:25.776 --> 01:45:26.417]  Alright?
[01:45:26.417 --> 01:45:26.897]  Okay.
[01:45:26.897 --> 01:45:27.858]  We're not gonna talk on camera.
[01:45:27.858 --> 01:45:29.439]  I gotta talk to you offline.
[01:45:29.439 --> 01:45:30.079]  Offline?
[01:45:30.079 --> 01:45:31.040]  Offline.
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:32.421]  You got that?
[01:45:32.421 --> 01:45:32.601]  What?
[01:45:33.683 --> 01:45:34.524]  Why are you upset?
[01:45:34.524 --> 01:45:36.165]  Aren't you the media officer?
[01:45:36.165 --> 01:45:37.525]  No, I'm just coming to see.
[01:45:37.525 --> 01:45:39.827]  I understand you've been talking to some of our officers.
[01:45:39.827 --> 01:45:42.148]  I wanted to ask some questions about the TSA.
[01:45:42.148 --> 01:45:43.649]  None of your officers talk.
[01:45:43.649 --> 01:45:47.551]  We have a process when you come through the media office at this airport.
[01:45:47.551 --> 01:45:49.593]  Everybody follows it.
[01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:51.134]  That's why I asked for you.
[01:45:51.134 --> 01:45:52.274]  That's why I asked for you.
[01:45:52.274 --> 01:45:53.355]  I'm not a PIO for the airport.
[01:45:53.355 --> 01:45:55.676]  There's a PIO for the airport.
[01:45:55.676 --> 01:45:57.017]  I represent TSA.
[01:45:57.017 --> 01:45:58.158]  Oh, that's who I wanted to talk to.
[01:45:58.158 --> 01:45:59.739]  I wanted to talk to the PIO for TSA.
[01:46:00.199 --> 01:46:04.441]  If you just don't talk to me like this, we've got some other processes before we go.
[01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:04.801]  Why?
[01:46:04.801 --> 01:46:06.582]  Can you guarantee us an interview?
[01:46:06.582 --> 01:46:07.502]  No, not right now.
[01:46:07.502 --> 01:46:08.022]  I'm sorry.
[01:46:08.022 --> 01:46:10.023]  I mean, if you call the head, that'd be fine.
[01:46:10.023 --> 01:46:12.504]  You know, maybe we could work something out.
[01:46:12.504 --> 01:46:13.164]  Okay, okay.
[01:46:13.164 --> 01:46:13.685]  Okay, okay.
[01:46:13.685 --> 01:46:14.825]  You know, we're just Americans.
[01:46:14.825 --> 01:46:16.246]  We're just trying to get this started.
[01:46:16.246 --> 01:46:17.266]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:46:17.266 --> 01:46:18.126]  You just can't.
[01:46:18.126 --> 01:46:20.407]  Yeah, but it shouldn't be like that in America.
[01:46:20.407 --> 01:46:21.628]  How come this is America?
[01:46:21.628 --> 01:46:23.268]  We should be able to talk to each other.
[01:46:23.268 --> 01:46:24.129]  Guys, this is America.
[01:46:24.129 --> 01:46:25.509]  You work for Homeland Security?
[01:46:25.509 --> 01:46:26.770]  Freedom of the press, first thing.
[01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:28.591]  Okay, you work for Homeland Security?
[01:46:29.571 --> 01:46:31.612]  The bottom line is the First Amendment, Jeff.
[01:46:31.612 --> 01:46:32.732]  Yeah, the First Amendment, sir.
[01:46:32.732 --> 01:46:33.093]  The what?
[01:46:33.093 --> 01:46:34.073]  The officers, the police officers.
[01:46:34.073 --> 01:46:35.273]  So we don't want that.
[01:46:35.273 --> 01:46:35.774]  Okay.
[01:46:35.774 --> 01:46:37.754]  The thing is, you're a public official.
[01:46:37.754 --> 01:46:40.856]  A public official has to answer in public.
[01:46:40.856 --> 01:46:42.436]  This is the First Amendment Constitution.
[01:46:42.436 --> 01:46:44.817]  You're a federal, you work for federal agencies.
[01:46:44.817 --> 01:46:46.398]  What are you going to do to me?
[01:46:46.398 --> 01:46:47.779]  What are you going to do to me?
[01:46:47.779 --> 01:46:49.699]  I'm not going to do anything to you.
[01:46:49.699 --> 01:46:52.741]  You're a public official and you have to answer the question in public.
[01:46:52.741 --> 01:46:56.082]  I'm not going to call you guys, because you're a big guy.
[01:46:56.082 --> 01:46:58.483]  We just wanted to know, as fellow Americans,
[01:46:59.403 --> 01:47:00.484]  I've got 300 million guys, ma'am.
[01:47:00.484 --> 01:47:01.705]  Well, you know, we're reporters.
[01:47:01.705 --> 01:47:04.167]  We're just trying to ask people questions.
[01:47:04.167 --> 01:47:05.208]  You've got to be professional.
[01:47:05.208 --> 01:47:06.408]  You've got to be professional.
[01:47:06.408 --> 01:47:07.489]  That's why we asked you.
[01:47:07.489 --> 01:47:10.651]  So your job is to basically come up and tell people that you can't help them.
[01:47:10.651 --> 01:47:11.012]  No, no.
[01:47:11.012 --> 01:47:12.633]  This is the airport.
[01:47:12.633 --> 01:47:14.114]  And again, there is a process.
[01:47:14.114 --> 01:47:16.175]  You guys can follow the process.
[01:47:16.175 --> 01:47:18.097]  A process to exercise the First Amendment?
[01:47:18.097 --> 01:47:22.600]  We're in a... Sorry, could you show me in the Constitution where it says we have to follow process?
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.861]  We didn't used to be like this.
[01:47:24.441 --> 01:47:24.841]  We know.
[01:47:24.841 --> 01:47:27.623]  I used to be able to run on the plane, hug people.
[01:47:27.623 --> 01:47:30.884]  Well, I got real blessed when I came through, and I don't think that I am a threat.
[01:47:30.884 --> 01:47:33.186]  Well, we know the State Department put the underwear bomb on the plane.
[01:47:33.186 --> 01:47:34.006]  That's on record, sir.
[01:47:34.006 --> 01:47:36.988]  How you doing, sir?
[01:47:36.988 --> 01:47:39.189]  Sir, the First Amendment says we don't need permission.
[01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:40.750]  Yes, you do.
[01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:41.350]  It's the First Amendment.
[01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:42.550]  Sir, do you write the Constitution?
[01:47:47.116 --> 01:47:49.818]  So the airport police take orders from the TSA, the Federal Government?
[01:47:49.818 --> 01:47:52.760]  You're going to have to have permission to film at the airport here.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:58.103]  You can film as long as you go through the PIO and they give you authorization to do it.
[01:47:58.103 --> 01:48:02.726]  Authorization to exercise the First Amendment, sir?
[01:48:02.726 --> 01:48:05.328]  Why do these guys have to file orders by Homeland Security?
[01:48:05.328 --> 01:48:08.610]  I mean, you're the authority here, not Homeland Security.
[01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:10.471]  But they're the ones who summoned you.
[01:48:12.959 --> 01:48:17.020]  Absolutely, but they're the ones who summoned you for this occasion.
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:23.362]  And you, as a war-abiding citizen, sir, you took an oath upon the Constitution to defend it.
[01:48:23.362 --> 01:48:24.503]  You did, every officer does.
[01:48:24.503 --> 01:48:28.984]  I have many family who are airport police in the province of Rhode Island, and people who are state police as well.
[01:48:28.984 --> 01:48:33.605]  You take an oath upon the Constitution to have that badge upon your chest, sir.
[01:48:33.605 --> 01:48:39.647]  And the Constitution is to defend the Constitution and its republic, not take orders from these tyrannical people of Homeland Security.
[01:48:39.647 --> 01:48:40.607]  They aren't tyrannical people.
[01:48:40.607 --> 01:48:41.308]  They are, sir.
[01:48:41.308 --> 01:48:42.428]  It's unrecognized.
[01:48:42.728 --> 01:48:43.328]  It's on record.
[01:48:43.328 --> 01:48:47.231]  These guys put the State Department put the underwear bomb on the plane.
[01:48:47.231 --> 01:48:49.933]  No, not at all.
[01:48:49.933 --> 01:48:52.074]  I'm just trying to address you as a citizen to citizen.
[01:48:52.074 --> 01:48:52.394]  That's all.
[01:48:52.394 --> 01:48:54.355]  We didn't do that, sir.
[01:48:54.355 --> 01:48:58.638]  You went up to one of their BDOs and he didn't really ask you questions.
[01:48:58.638 --> 01:49:00.860]  Yeah, and we respected that.
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:04.722]  Yeah, all we asked is for a PIO, a public information officer.
[01:49:04.722 --> 01:49:06.043]  That's all we asked for.
[01:49:06.043 --> 01:49:07.524]  And by law, they have to have one.
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:11.253]  These people don't have authorization to film here.
[01:49:11.253 --> 01:49:11.774]  Oh, okay.
[01:49:11.774 --> 01:49:13.675]  Do you want to tell them the proper process?
[01:49:13.675 --> 01:49:14.395]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:14.395 --> 01:49:19.138]  What you've got to do in order to film here is you're going to have to call our dispatch.
[01:49:19.138 --> 01:49:21.659]  You've got to get with the proper individuals to be able to film here.
[01:49:21.659 --> 01:49:21.979]  No, no, no.
[01:49:21.979 --> 01:49:23.060]  That's where we're going.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:24.521]  So, excuse us for this time.
[01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:28.323]  We need to file proper procedures to exercise the First Amendment.
[01:49:51.658 --> 01:49:55.180]  Sir, this is a Constitution of the United States.
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.480]  I don't have to show my ID, sir.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:56.921]  No, I don't, sir.
[01:49:56.921 --> 01:49:58.581]  It's my constitutional right.
[01:49:58.581 --> 01:49:59.422]  I don't have it on me.
[01:50:04.264 --> 01:50:07.948]  And the Constitution of the United States says, shall not be infringed.
[01:50:07.948 --> 01:50:08.649]  Freedom of speech.
[01:50:08.649 --> 01:50:09.750]  Do you like the Constitution?
[01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:11.612]  I'm not being confrontational.
[01:50:11.612 --> 01:50:16.837]  I'm just standing up here as an American that wants to defend my civil liberties and my rights.
[01:50:16.837 --> 01:50:20.981]  And to film in a public place as my taxpayers pay for this airport.
[01:50:20.981 --> 01:50:22.963]  Your salaries as well.
[01:50:22.963 --> 01:50:23.904]  Is Jason available?
[01:50:24.665 --> 01:50:27.787]  Jason, I can give you a phone number where you can try to reach Jason.
[01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:28.107]  Okay.
[01:50:28.107 --> 01:50:29.648]  I can definitely do that.
[01:50:29.648 --> 01:50:31.069]  Alright, that'd be great.
[01:50:31.069 --> 01:50:31.350]  Okay.
[01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:32.130]  Okay, thank you.
[01:50:32.130 --> 01:50:33.171]  Here, I'll write it down.
[01:50:33.171 --> 01:50:34.832]  Do you know what off your head?
[01:50:34.832 --> 01:50:35.452]  Yes, I do.
[01:50:35.452 --> 01:50:36.353]  Okay, thank you.
[01:50:38.157 --> 01:50:39.558]  Nothing against you personally, sir.
[01:50:39.558 --> 01:50:44.022]  I'm just defending the Constitution that you probably served when you were in the military, if you were.
[01:50:44.022 --> 01:50:45.363]  That's all we wanted, sir.
[01:50:45.363 --> 01:50:46.404]  We just asked what it is.
[01:50:46.404 --> 01:50:48.086]  You're being totally confrontational.
[01:50:48.086 --> 01:50:48.966]  We've got a long video, sir.
[01:50:48.966 --> 01:50:50.328]  You're being totally confrontational.
[01:50:50.328 --> 01:50:51.809]  No, I'm just defending my rights as a citizen.
[01:50:51.809 --> 01:50:52.690]  You're being totally confrontational.
[01:50:52.690 --> 01:50:53.290]  No, I'm not, sir.
[01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:54.051]  We'll get out of here, guys.
[01:50:54.051 --> 01:50:55.792]  You don't have that right right here at this point.
[01:50:56.673 --> 01:50:59.034]  All right, that's good.
[01:50:59.034 --> 01:51:01.534]  We're going to post the full video later.
[01:51:01.534 --> 01:51:03.875]  I'm going to air it all on the Nightly News tonight.
[01:51:03.875 --> 01:51:04.635]  Aaron's doing the news.
[01:51:04.635 --> 01:51:05.455]  I'm doing a couple of interviews.
[01:51:05.455 --> 01:51:09.356]  We're going to have Dan Bodondi, who's doing a fabulous job, as well as other reporters there.
[01:51:09.356 --> 01:51:15.038]  Now, to be clear, he's got the microphone about three feet away from the guy they're calling that confrontational.
[01:51:15.038 --> 01:51:19.119]  And what they do is they target moms when they're strip searching their five-year-old for everybody.
[01:51:19.119 --> 01:51:20.259]  You've seen the films.
[01:51:20.259 --> 01:51:21.539]  They tell them, I'll take you to prison.
[01:51:21.539 --> 01:51:22.640]  It's illegal to film us.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:23.000]  It's not.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.361]  They'll say we gotta do the proper policy.
[01:51:26.361 --> 01:51:27.661]  This isn't even up at the checkpoint.
[01:51:27.661 --> 01:51:35.764]  This is just in the airport going and asking near the offices, hey, where John Bowne's been many times working for KXAN, local, what is that, ABC?
[01:51:35.764 --> 01:51:37.125]  It's NBC.
[01:51:37.125 --> 01:51:37.785]  Yeah, NBC.
[01:51:37.785 --> 01:51:39.806]  I mean, many, many times working here locally.
[01:51:39.806 --> 01:51:41.146]  That's why he knew the name of the guy.
[01:51:41.146 --> 01:51:43.447]  The mainstream media just struts in whenever they want.
[01:51:43.447 --> 01:51:47.848]  But citizens and alternative media and real media, it's like, I'll take you to jail.
[01:51:47.848 --> 01:51:51.850]  And in Illinois, they tried to give people, one guy, life in prison for filming police.
[01:51:52.290 --> 01:51:52.770]  We're good to go.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:21.524]  You're not going to go film them, and it's all color of law, and the cops show up and say, you know, give me your ID, don't leave.
[01:52:21.524 --> 01:52:22.344]  Well, am I detained?
[01:52:22.344 --> 01:52:27.847]  No, you're not, but don't leave, which is a custodial arrest, which is only a citizen's arrest power.
[01:52:27.847 --> 01:52:33.810]  And then cities and counties hire police professionally to act in that as a citizen's arrest.
[01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:35.791]  And then as a citizen, you get a bond.
[01:52:36.491 --> 01:52:37.651]  You get a bond.
[01:52:37.651 --> 01:52:40.752]  But see, they just want... Your kids aren't playing outside.
[01:52:40.752 --> 01:52:41.893]  You aren't going anywhere.
[01:52:41.893 --> 01:52:43.673]  We're going to give you shots when we want.
[01:52:43.673 --> 01:52:45.254]  You're going to drink fluoride.
[01:52:45.254 --> 01:52:46.874]  You're going to submit to us 110%.
[01:52:46.874 --> 01:52:50.635]  So, that's what this is about.
[01:52:50.635 --> 01:52:52.656]  It's about us saying, no, we're going to film you.
[01:52:52.656 --> 01:52:53.616]  And I don't even know.
[01:52:53.616 --> 01:52:55.037]  I told you guys to go do me on the street.
[01:52:55.037 --> 01:52:56.417]  You just went over there yesterday.
[01:52:56.417 --> 01:52:58.218]  So I'm really glad you did that.
[01:52:58.218 --> 01:52:59.438]  Any closing comments on that?
[01:52:59.949 --> 01:53:04.451]  I just want to say, folks out there, civil disobedience, the time is now.
[01:53:04.451 --> 01:53:05.511]  Go read the Bill of Rights.
[01:53:05.511 --> 01:53:10.694]  Go find that petty tyrant in your community and exercise your American right.
[01:53:10.694 --> 01:53:15.036]  Well, I am going to call for another protest nationwide, we phone the TSA.
[01:53:15.036 --> 01:53:17.537]  Nationwide, we go protest the NSA.
[01:53:17.537 --> 01:53:20.278]  It's time to stop being scared of these people.
[01:53:20.278 --> 01:53:22.559]  If they're able to scare us, they're taking over.
[01:53:22.559 --> 01:53:23.679]  They have no power.
[01:53:23.679 --> 01:53:26.120]  They've shut up re-education camps.
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.061]  It's now official.
[01:53:27.701 --> 01:53:29.142]  They really tried to scare us.
[01:53:29.142 --> 01:53:31.203]  The first thing he did was start calling for backup.
[01:53:31.203 --> 01:53:32.884]  And I said to him, you know what?
[01:53:32.884 --> 01:53:38.227]  I'm going to call 911 and have this recorded and ask for your training officer to come out here because I'm feeling really harassed now.
[01:53:38.227 --> 01:53:39.067]  And I'm not doing anything.
[01:53:39.067 --> 01:53:41.749]  No, no, Linda, you're supposed to when you fly back and forth from here from L.A.
[01:53:41.749 --> 01:53:46.932]  where you got your business, you're supposed to just let them grab you and let them put you in microwave ovens.
[01:53:46.932 --> 01:53:48.292]  You're supposed to like it.
[01:53:48.292 --> 01:53:49.193]  I'm supposed to like it.
[01:53:49.193 --> 01:53:53.635]  I can't take my kids on a plane ride or go somewhere because I won't let men grab their genitals.
[01:53:53.635 --> 01:53:54.876]  I'm supposed to think that's normal.
[01:53:56.192 --> 01:53:57.152]  Ridiculous.
[01:53:57.152 --> 01:53:57.813]  Just ridiculous.
[01:53:57.813 --> 01:54:07.836]  And I interviewed one woman and I said, do you think women like this, really attractive women, I said, do you think it's okay that they're groping our bodies, that we're even a possible threat?
[01:54:07.836 --> 01:54:11.098]  Oh, the new documents that they blocked for two years coming out?
[01:54:11.098 --> 01:54:16.460]  The four-year letters show the thousands of letters where they go in the pants of women.
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:18.160]  And I can't even say this on air.
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.782]  I mean, Miss USA, they actually went in her.
[01:54:21.782 --> 01:54:24.503]  They're now removing tampons out of women.
[01:54:25.533 --> 01:54:26.153]  What is this?
[01:54:26.153 --> 01:54:27.694]  What the hell do you think it is?
[01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:28.754]  What will we put up with?
[01:54:28.754 --> 01:54:29.995]  We're such a joke!
[01:54:29.995 --> 01:54:30.435]  You know what?
[01:54:30.435 --> 01:54:31.575]  We're gonna win, Alex.
[01:54:31.575 --> 01:54:32.475]  We're gonna win all this.
[01:54:32.475 --> 01:54:35.116]  And all you people that have done this, you're gonna be arrested.
[01:54:35.116 --> 01:54:38.197]  Because my kids aren't gonna deal with this in their future.
[01:54:38.197 --> 01:54:40.238]  I'm thinking about my kids right here!
[01:54:40.238 --> 01:54:41.578]  We're done!
[01:54:41.578 --> 01:54:42.399]  We're done!
[01:54:42.399 --> 01:54:43.599]  We know you ran 9-11!
[01:54:43.599 --> 01:54:45.920]  We know you did it, murderers!
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:46.380]  It's over!
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.141]  And they backed down.
[01:54:48.141 --> 01:54:50.382]  Do you want to call me some more, NSA?
[01:54:50.382 --> 01:54:52.062]  They got scared, they did.
[01:54:52.062 --> 01:54:54.804]  The three of us together and Dan would like the Constitution.
[01:54:54.804 --> 01:54:57.125]  Good, they're gonna... And the guy's like, you don't know what oath I took.
[01:54:57.125 --> 01:54:58.425]  He's like, I know what oath you took.
[01:54:58.425 --> 01:54:59.226]  You're wearing the badge.
[01:54:59.226 --> 01:55:00.286]  You had to take the oath.
[01:55:00.286 --> 01:55:00.967]  They'll find out.
[01:55:00.967 --> 01:55:04.448]  Look, look, they think they have a status and we're second class.
[01:55:04.448 --> 01:55:05.889]  We're American scum.
[01:55:05.889 --> 01:55:06.689]  We pay the bills.
[01:55:06.689 --> 01:55:07.530]  That's what they see us as.
[01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:10.151]  We are nothing but their slaves, and it's over!
[01:55:10.151 --> 01:55:11.492]  We're off the plantation!
[01:55:11.492 --> 01:55:12.112]  It's over!
[01:55:12.112 --> 01:55:13.192]  You got the message?
[01:55:13.192 --> 01:55:14.593]  I hope you do!
[01:55:14.593 --> 01:55:17.154]  If you support the Republic, then you're our friend.
[01:55:17.154 --> 01:55:22.817]  But if you say George Washington's bad like the police training manuals do, you're an enemy collaborator with the foreign banks.
[01:55:22.817 --> 01:55:24.418]  We're gonna have you all back on The Nightly News tonight.
[01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:25.618]  Great job.
[01:55:25.618 --> 01:55:26.839]  We can get three people in that studio.
[01:55:26.839 --> 01:55:28.079]  Thank you.
[01:55:28.079 --> 01:55:28.680]  There they go.
[01:55:28.680 --> 01:55:30.200]  Alright, I'm shifting gears now to gold.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.061]  Gold has exploded.
[01:55:31.861 --> 01:55:32.662]  Massively today.
[01:55:32.662 --> 01:55:33.942]  He hadn't been on for months.
[01:55:33.942 --> 01:55:35.904]  We predicted as the fall started it would go up.
[01:55:35.904 --> 01:55:37.424]  They're talking about QE3.
[01:55:37.424 --> 01:55:43.588]  I believe now, I just bought some last week, just a few silver, a few gold, is the time to buy gold and silver.
[01:55:43.588 --> 01:55:46.170]  I believe now is the time to get yourself prepared.
[01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:51.353]  I believe it's only going to go up as they globally devalue the dollar and other major currencies that they're devaluing in unison.
[01:55:51.753 --> 01:55:52.894]  And Ted's got gold.
[01:55:52.894 --> 01:55:56.178]  He bought at the old lower prices, even though gold's way up today.
[01:55:56.178 --> 01:55:57.539]  And he's got a bunch of other specials.
[01:55:57.539 --> 01:56:08.089]  Ted Anderson, owner of Genesis Communications, the gold company that I had as a sponsor before, you know, you even had a radio network that I sought out, a really good, reputable company.
[01:56:08.089 --> 01:56:12.274]  And here you are with the best deals I know of out there, on the bullion especially.
[01:56:12.274 --> 01:56:13.795]  Ted Anderson, tell us what you got today.
[01:56:13.795 --> 01:56:14.416]  Give us the offer.
[01:56:15.231 --> 01:56:18.292]  Well, I mean, the ECB bonds was what's driving the market, Alex.
[01:56:18.292 --> 01:56:24.135]  And what we have going on right now, the offers that we have are going to be the Frank coin at $3.72.
[01:56:24.135 --> 01:56:25.796]  We have walking Liberty halves at $15.74.
[01:56:25.796 --> 01:56:30.197]  The Lakota Silver Rounds, a lot of people still like those.
[01:56:30.197 --> 01:56:31.598]  They're $40.96.
[01:56:31.598 --> 01:56:35.360]  Canadian Maple Leafs, also a very good coin to be getting into.
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:35.960]  We got the U.S.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:36.660]  Eagles.
[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.101]  Currently right now, Canadian Maple Leafs.
[01:56:38.641 --> 01:56:38.701]  I'm
[01:56:56.494 --> 01:57:19.104]  Gold is up today $10.20 and we've already seen $1,715 an ounce and you know that's just the beginning we're just coming into this so yeah if you're gonna be getting in moving in on gold and silver you better take your action now because even silver right now at $32.75 that's up $0.38 today and you know we've been talking about QE3 well what's going on in Europe well that is QE3 they're talking about bailing out
[01:57:23.886 --> 01:57:27.327]  What are the best gold and silver bullion prices you've got?
[01:57:27.327 --> 01:57:28.628]  What should people call and get right now?
[01:57:38.547 --> 01:57:49.396]  Well, what I would do, if you're looking for something right now, I'd look for the Canadian Maple Leaf currently at this particular time, just due to the fact that that coin is $9.99 fine, it's $18.59.75.
[01:57:49.396 --> 01:57:52.618]  Of course, there's volume discounts right now at this particular coin.
[01:57:52.618 --> 01:58:02.826]  For those of you who have been very concerned, been hearing a lot about confiscation, that type of thing, you can get into the $20 gold pieces right now at this particular time at $2,045.
[01:58:02.826 --> 01:58:06.249]  But again, Alex, I think the most important thing is you take action.
[01:58:06.249 --> 01:58:06.970]  Get involved now.
[01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.870]  I agree, Ted.
[01:58:07.870 --> 01:58:14.093]  Let me fire out the Midas Resources number and I want to go on a break, come back for five minutes with you and talk about some of the economic numbers.
[01:58:14.093 --> 01:58:15.254]  QE3, 800-686-2237.
[01:58:15.254 --> 01:58:22.458]  And the tiny profit they make goes right back into the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[01:58:22.458 --> 01:58:22.998]  800-686-2237.
[01:58:22.998 --> 01:58:30.202]  And some of their best deals are linked in the right-hand corner at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:30.202 --> 01:58:32.823]  That's MidasResources.com.
[01:58:32.823 --> 01:58:34.244]  MidasResources.com or 800-686-2237.
[01:58:37.065 --> 01:58:41.708]  The next hour, straight ahead!
[01:58:41.708 --> 01:58:42.809]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.241 --> 01:58:54.703]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth seekers.
[01:58:54.703 --> 01:59:00.646]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at Infowars.com.
[01:59:00.646 --> 01:59:07.250]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:12.933]  And that's Dreams from My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at Infowars.com.
[01:59:12.933 --> 01:59:16.575]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:59:16.755 --> 01:59:20.559]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:59:20.559 --> 01:59:25.163]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.
[01:59:25.163 --> 01:59:27.666]  You'll also find it at infowarshop.com.
[01:59:27.666 --> 01:59:31.530]  None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:59:31.530 --> 01:59:35.954]  We're also carrying Behind the Green Mask, UN Agenda 21, by Rosa Corey.
[01:59:35.954 --> 01:59:38.597]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:59:38.897 --> 01:59:45.725]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:59:45.725 --> 01:59:54.135]  These titles and a lot more are all available at InfoWarshot.com.
[01:59:54.135 --> 01:59:56.517]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.517 --> 01:59:59.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.953 --> 02:00:10.794]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.794 --> 02:00:12.375]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.375 --> 02:00:13.915]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.915 --> 02:00:18.096]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.096 --> 02:00:22.217]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.347 --> 02:00:42.672]  Alright, Ted Anderson, decades in the gold and silver business, MidasResources.com, 800-686-2237.
[02:00:42.672 --> 02:00:52.882]  He's joining us right now, just briefly, ahead of the NSA report we're going to give you, coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:52.882 --> 02:00:54.063]  Ted, I mean, look!
[02:00:55.464 --> 02:00:56.645]  You read the financial news.
[02:00:56.645 --> 02:00:59.026]  They're starting to lean towards QE3.
[02:00:59.026 --> 02:01:00.386]  I'm surprised they haven't gone to it yet.
[02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:03.668]  I'm not saying go to it, but if they don't, things will really implode.
[02:01:03.668 --> 02:01:07.469]  But if they do QE3, they'll have hyperinflation that'll lead to an implosion.
[02:01:07.469 --> 02:01:09.490]  So we're in trouble either way.
[02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:12.532]  But obviously, they drove down gold artificially.
[02:01:12.532 --> 02:01:18.014]  That even came out in the news, manipulating paper, engaging in fraud.
[02:01:18.014 --> 02:01:19.815]  But they can't hold it down forever.
[02:01:19.815 --> 02:01:23.216]  That's why I've held on to gold I bought at $300 and gold I bought at $1,900.
[02:01:24.437 --> 02:01:26.980]  Just because I drove it down a few hundred bucks, I didn't panic.
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:28.803]  Because it's an emergency backup.
[02:01:28.803 --> 02:01:32.167]  You know, I don't buy it for an investment, even though it's been one of the best performing.
[02:01:32.167 --> 02:01:33.689]  And it's now time to get gold and silver.
[02:01:33.689 --> 02:01:37.493]  But in the three or four minutes we've got here, why is gold starting to rocket up?
[02:01:37.493 --> 02:01:40.017]  And why have you told me privately you thought it would go up in the fall?
[02:01:40.017 --> 02:01:40.918]  Well, you've said that publicly.
[02:01:41.539 --> 02:01:44.180]  Well, I mean, it typically does.
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:50.703]  I mean, usually in the summertime we see our low point, and usually in the fall, coming even towards the end of the year, we see our peak.
[02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:53.424]  And this year is like the average year.
[02:01:53.424 --> 02:01:54.904]  I mean, there was a couple years ago when we had
[02:01:57.205 --> 02:01:59.726]  TARP money that was being asked for.
[02:01:59.726 --> 02:02:03.748]  We had a great summer, and the fall was fantastic, too, in gold.
[02:02:03.748 --> 02:02:05.869]  But right now, you're seeing all this.
[02:02:05.869 --> 02:02:09.791]  The problems in the United States and the problems in Europe have not gone away.
[02:02:09.791 --> 02:02:17.455]  Gold went down about $1,550 an ounce, but we still had all the fundamental reasons why people should buy gold.
[02:02:17.455 --> 02:02:20.017]  Although, when it's gone down, people back away from it.
[02:02:20.017 --> 02:02:22.558]  Now we're in the fall, and for some reason,
[02:02:23.278 --> 02:02:28.922]  You know, just quantitative easing in Europe all of a sudden triggers gold to go up in price at this time of year.
[02:02:28.922 --> 02:02:30.122]  You'll see gold rise.
[02:02:30.122 --> 02:02:34.885]  It won't be surprising to me to see $2,000 an ounce gold now, because the last peak was at $1,900.
[02:02:34.885 --> 02:02:35.866]  We're at $1,704.60.
[02:02:35.866 --> 02:02:36.807]  We've come up off of $1,550.
[02:02:36.807 --> 02:02:38.728]  Silver right now at $3,275, coming up from $26.
[02:02:38.728 --> 02:02:41.289]  I mean, that's a really nice increase, but I've got to tell you,
[02:02:47.433 --> 02:02:54.518]  The future right now is still ahead of us because we're still sitting in September, we've got October, November, December.
[02:02:54.518 --> 02:02:58.301]  I mean the elections, you think that the elections are going to solve this problem and it's just not.
[02:02:58.301 --> 02:03:01.443]  The globalists are digging in like it's the end of the world, Ted.
[02:03:01.443 --> 02:03:08.507]  I've got to get you on the nightly news for like a full hour where we don't have commercials except the start and the end to really go over all the numbers and
[02:03:09.568 --> 02:03:22.256]  Soros buying gold, and all the other big globalists are buying it, while telling the public not to buy it, because they know it exposes the fact that their fiat currency's dying, while they scurry, and while universities buy billions of it, like UT.
[02:03:22.256 --> 02:03:27.879]  I believe now is the time to get gold and silver, and folks, call and ask for the Alex Jones Radio Specials.
[02:03:27.879 --> 02:03:29.980]  They've got a whole list of stuff at the lower price.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:31.121]  It's already gone up.
[02:03:31.121 --> 02:03:32.442]  You regularly call, and it goes up.
[02:03:32.442 --> 02:03:35.504]  That's how you make money in gold and silver, is buy when it's low, sell when it's high.
[02:03:35.504 --> 02:03:38.986]  In a free market, we're not communists, but Ted will hold the price down.
[02:03:39.246 --> 02:03:41.247]  How long can you hold the price down, Ted?
[02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:54.072]  I'm going to be doing it today, and I can tell you one of the things that I have right now, I still have the $63 book, you know, the two DVDs and the book, or the book and DVD and the two silver dollars for $63 shipped to your doorstep.
[02:03:54.072 --> 02:03:56.292]  You're not going to buy silver dollars for that price anymore.
[02:03:56.292 --> 02:04:00.914]  Yeah, you get the free, and they're almost sold out, the Big Brother book that's excellent, paralleling 1984.
[02:04:03.089 --> 02:04:07.131]  And then we also have the American Dream DVD about the banking system.
[02:04:07.131 --> 02:04:08.311]  Great way to wake up newbies.
[02:04:08.311 --> 02:04:09.272]  It's a cartoon.
[02:04:09.272 --> 02:04:10.272]  Very well produced.
[02:04:10.272 --> 02:04:11.213]  Hilarious as well.
[02:04:11.213 --> 02:04:11.833]  Little adult.
[02:04:11.833 --> 02:04:12.994]  Little racy.
[02:04:12.994 --> 02:04:14.674]  Folks, probably not good to show small children.
[02:04:14.674 --> 02:04:15.715]  I mean, tiny.
[02:04:15.715 --> 02:04:17.076]  Folks will watch it and won't think it's racy.
[02:04:17.076 --> 02:04:19.477]  But the point is, it could be racy for some people.
[02:04:19.477 --> 02:04:21.938]  You get those free with the two silver dollars at cost.
[02:04:22.478 --> 02:04:24.139]  And that's the Big Brother special.
[02:04:24.139 --> 02:04:28.680]  There's a link at Infowars.com or go to MidasResources.com to find that.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.060]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:32.182]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:32.182 --> 02:04:39.684]  And it looks like we're starting to go back into another bull market in Precious Metals.
[02:04:39.684 --> 02:04:40.745]  So get in now.
[02:04:40.745 --> 02:04:42.485]  In my view, I know that's what I'm doing.
[02:04:42.485 --> 02:04:44.246]  800-686-2237.
[02:04:44.246 --> 02:04:46.647]  The place, MidasResources.
[02:04:46.647 --> 02:04:49.748]  MidasResources.com to find some of the radio specials.
[02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:52.009]  But for a full list, tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:52.409 --> 02:04:53.812]  Thank you, Chet Anderson.
[02:04:53.812 --> 02:04:54.733]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:04:54.733 --> 02:04:55.315]  We'll be back.
[02:04:55.315 --> 02:04:56.998]  Why is the NSA calling our office?
[02:04:56.998 --> 02:04:57.458]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.006 --> 02:05:12.637]  The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing professional class product for producing endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions right from the convenience of your home.
[02:05:12.637 --> 02:05:22.848]  With recent regulations threatening the sale of silver-based supplements, now you can secure yourself and your family by producing your own silver solutions anywhere, anytime.
[02:05:23.769 --> 02:05:31.331]  You can have the peace of mind knowing that you can create endless supply of silver anytime, anywhere, for any application.
[02:05:31.331 --> 02:05:38.533]  The Silver Lungs Generator is a one-time purchase that requires no maintenance nor replacement parts for the life of the unit.
[02:05:38.533 --> 02:05:43.314]  This product was designed to be an invaluable part of your vital preparations.
[02:05:43.314 --> 02:05:50.636]  For a detailed report on the differences between ionic silver, colloidal silver, and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing,
[02:05:50.836 --> 02:06:01.206]  Please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com for more information on why you should be producing your own silver solutions right from your home forever.
[02:06:01.206 --> 02:06:07.712]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:06:07.712 --> 02:06:10.315]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:06:10.315 --> 02:06:15.380]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:20.661]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:06:20.661 --> 02:06:28.303]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoodsDirect now.
[02:06:28.303 --> 02:06:32.163]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[02:06:32.163 --> 02:06:33.964]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:06:33.964 --> 02:06:37.984]  I recently increased my supply from eFoodsDirect because we have all known this was coming.
[02:06:37.984 --> 02:06:40.585]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:06:40.885 --> 02:06:43.668]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:06:43.668 --> 02:06:48.234]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:06:48.234 --> 02:06:48.874]  Don't wait!
[02:06:48.874 --> 02:06:50.757]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:50.757 --> 02:06:52.358]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:52.358 --> 02:06:53.860]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:00.928 --> 02:07:06.433]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die?
[02:07:06.433 --> 02:07:08.835]  Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[02:07:08.835 --> 02:07:17.942]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is ProPure and it's available discounted at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:17.942 --> 02:07:21.385]  Its filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth.
[02:07:21.385 --> 02:07:23.066]  There's no priming required.
[02:07:23.066 --> 02:07:25.348]  It's NSF 42 certified.
[02:07:25.348 --> 02:07:27.850]  Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[02:07:28.911 --> 02:07:30.431]  Easy to set up and use.
[02:07:30.431 --> 02:07:31.852]  Doesn't require electricity.
[02:07:31.852 --> 02:07:35.013]  Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.
[02:07:35.013 --> 02:07:38.394]  This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[02:07:38.394 --> 02:07:42.535]  Save money by not buying bottled water, and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[02:07:42.535 --> 02:07:45.276]  ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.
[02:07:45.276 --> 02:07:46.856]  It's what my family uses.
[02:07:46.856 --> 02:07:50.157]  Infowars.com already has the lowest price on ProPure.
[02:07:50.157 --> 02:07:55.419]  But if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off at Infowars.com.
[02:07:55.999 --> 02:07:57.340]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:07:57.340 --> 02:07:58.821]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:58.821 --> 02:08:03.364]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:26.872 --> 02:08:49.419]  If you go up to Infowars.com, you'll see articles by Paul Joseph Watson linking through the London Telegraph, where the different inventors of the Internet have gotten together and written public letters saying that a new dark age of tyranny is upon us, that governments are spying on us en masse.
[02:08:49.419 --> 02:08:53.901]  The one man that most scientists agree came up with the idea for the Internet,
[02:08:55.379 --> 02:08:59.100]  Still looks young, even though this came up with these ideas in the 70s.
[02:08:59.100 --> 02:09:05.261]  Sir Tim Berners-Lee accuses government of draconian internet snooping.
[02:09:05.261 --> 02:09:07.142]  He doesn't accuse them, it's admitted.
[02:09:07.142 --> 02:09:12.563]  And he goes on to say that there is a giant web of government invasion and monitoring the web.
[02:09:12.563 --> 02:09:14.643]  I mean, the British government admits they're doing that.
[02:09:14.643 --> 02:09:17.384]  WebInventor warns government internet has no off switch.
[02:09:17.984 --> 02:09:19.626]  He says you're not going to stop us.
[02:09:19.626 --> 02:09:22.008]  He's never been a political guy.
[02:09:22.008 --> 02:09:24.070]  And there's all these other people coming out.
[02:09:24.070 --> 02:09:37.503]  There are new NSA whistleblowers just every few days that are coming out and saying, hey, we're listening to everything.
[02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:38.724]  We've got hubs and everything.
[02:09:38.724 --> 02:09:40.786]  The FBI agent just got caught.
[02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:45.461]  With 12 million Apple IDs and of course they denied it.
[02:09:45.461 --> 02:09:48.522]  Folks, Dave, under the Telecommunications Act, they're wired into everything.
[02:09:48.522 --> 02:09:49.962]  They're dialing in.
[02:09:49.962 --> 02:09:54.423]  Now going back about 10 years ago, I occasionally would get a call at home or a call on the cell phone.
[02:09:54.423 --> 02:09:59.305]  It would say no number available or it would just be zeros or there'd be no number.
[02:09:59.305 --> 02:10:00.245]  And then I would
[02:10:01.687 --> 02:10:04.989]  Call the number back, because nobody would talk, and they would say, National Security Agency.
[02:10:04.989 --> 02:10:05.969]  And I'd say, you just called me.
[02:10:05.969 --> 02:10:07.730]  They're like, may we help you?
[02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:11.172]  You know, this is a government agency.
[02:10:11.172 --> 02:10:12.033]  What is the name?
[02:10:12.033 --> 02:10:13.374]  What is the extension?
[02:10:13.374 --> 02:10:17.576]  And I would go check the number and find out it was the NSA.
[02:10:17.576 --> 02:10:22.119]  And my phone would turn off and stuff when this happened.
[02:10:22.119 --> 02:10:25.441]  It's like when they call you, it does some order for computers to take it over.
[02:10:26.294 --> 02:10:26.994]  That's what I thought.
[02:10:26.994 --> 02:10:39.119]  It's obviously harassment, because then, later, I've had a few of these calls, my wife's had even more than I have, where a woman calls up and says, your husband got me pregnant, your husband gave me a disease, your husband... I mean, it's different stories.
[02:10:39.119 --> 02:10:41.420]  And then she'll say, no, he didn't, that's not true.
[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:44.742]  And they'll say, well, we're going to get you, and we saw your little dog in the backyard.
[02:10:44.742 --> 02:10:46.562]  That's a nice dress you were wearing.
[02:10:46.562 --> 02:10:49.584]  Or they'll say, hey, we heard you talking to your mommy or your daddy.
[02:10:49.584 --> 02:10:51.744]  You know, I'm glad they're in the hospital.
[02:10:51.744 --> 02:10:55.226]  So they'll call right after you're talking to family.
[02:10:55.706 --> 02:10:59.970]  And always at an emotional point, they're waiting to trigger fear in you.
[02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:07.817]  They're waiting in the shy-op till you get the news that your dad's in the hospital, your mom's in the hospital, and that's when the... whoever it is, tap on our phones.
[02:11:09.278 --> 02:11:13.962]  Because there's 15 agencies doing it, and there's hundreds of private contractors.
[02:11:13.962 --> 02:11:19.767]  There's the Total Information Awareness Network, where they came out in the New York Times, and said, we're listening to everything you do, everything you buy.
[02:11:19.767 --> 02:11:28.073]  And there was a backlash, and they said, okay, Admiral Poindexter is off that job, the felon, now, who got pardoned.
[02:11:28.073 --> 02:11:29.174]  But then it came right back.
[02:11:29.174 --> 02:11:34.879]  So, they admit they've got it to intimidate us, but then when we talk about it, they then back off.
[02:11:36.024 --> 02:11:38.445]  Okay, so that's what's going on.
[02:11:38.445 --> 02:11:40.045]  That's what's happening here.
[02:11:40.045 --> 02:11:41.886]  That's what's unfolding.
[02:11:41.886 --> 02:11:44.107]  Now, Russell Dowden, I've known Russell 12 years.
[02:11:44.107 --> 02:11:46.167]  He's a no-nonsense guy.
[02:11:46.167 --> 02:11:48.048]  For over a decade, he had Weird Magazine.
[02:11:48.048 --> 02:11:48.688]  I've now bought it.
[02:11:48.688 --> 02:11:51.489]  We're going to republish it down the road.
[02:11:51.489 --> 02:11:54.570]  But I knew he'd put out successfully a monthly publication.
[02:11:54.570 --> 02:11:55.471]  And I liked him.
[02:11:55.471 --> 02:11:57.451]  And so I went ahead and said, you know, we're going to pull the trigger.
[02:11:57.451 --> 02:11:58.872]  We're going to launch InfoWars Magazine.
[02:12:00.588 --> 02:12:01.389]  I don't
[02:12:19.258 --> 02:12:20.159]  You know what?
[02:12:20.159 --> 02:12:23.022]  We may have to blow your phone up here on air and actually show people.
[02:12:23.022 --> 02:12:24.123]  Just give it to me.
[02:12:24.123 --> 02:12:24.503]  Okay.
[02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:24.724]  Okay.
[02:12:24.724 --> 02:12:27.006]  We blew it up so everybody can see it.
[02:12:27.006 --> 02:12:32.832]  There is the mobile call number on his new AT&T Droid phone.
[02:12:32.832 --> 02:12:34.414]  And Russell's going to talk to us here in just a moment.
[02:12:38.021 --> 02:12:39.563]  That is the call that he got.
[02:12:39.563 --> 02:12:41.284]  In fact, you showed me the call history.
[02:12:41.284 --> 02:12:45.188]  There's actually an area in there that shows the region it came from.
[02:12:45.188 --> 02:12:49.092]  It shows that they called you.
[02:12:49.092 --> 02:12:49.673]  Can I see your phone?
[02:12:49.673 --> 02:12:51.334]  I want to show people the part where it says they called you.
[02:12:51.334 --> 02:12:53.236]  That was the data sheet that I wanted to show people.
[02:12:53.236 --> 02:12:55.338]  We'll just show people watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:12:55.338 --> 02:12:58.401]  If not, if you're on the radio listening to this, you can
[02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:05.855]  Yeah, just pull it up where I can see that, because that's Will Jones and other people.
[02:13:05.855 --> 02:13:06.578]  Just pull that up for me.
[02:13:06.578 --> 02:13:07.902]  We're going to do this right now here on air.
[02:13:08.704 --> 02:13:21.688]  Uh, so the issue is, I want people to see that the call history, the NSA called you, and the number we just showed on screen, if you're a radio listener, we're streaming video, again by tomorrow this will be posted for everybody at Infowars.com, is the NSA.
[02:13:21.688 --> 02:13:28.150]  And we called it yesterday, we called it again today, it's the National Security Agency, we checked the number online, it's the NSA.
[02:13:28.150 --> 02:13:32.351]  So, they've done this to me before, so Russell, you're probably gonna get
[02:13:33.402 --> 02:13:35.723]  You know, the phone call, I know your stepdad's got cancer.
[02:13:35.723 --> 02:13:37.063]  If you get the call, he dies.
[02:13:37.063 --> 02:13:37.824]  God forbid.
[02:13:37.824 --> 02:13:39.044]  That's when they'll hit you.
[02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:41.265]  I just want to warn you, that's when they'll call.
[02:13:41.265 --> 02:13:42.785]  Because again, they want to terrorize you.
[02:13:42.785 --> 02:13:45.046]  And I think that's the point where they'll freak you out.
[02:13:45.046 --> 02:13:47.667]  And again, this is who runs our country.
[02:13:47.667 --> 02:13:49.488]  This is who's listening to our phones.
[02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:50.468]  This is what they do.
[02:13:50.468 --> 02:13:53.109]  And while we're digging that out, Russell, tell folks the story.
[02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.529]  Let me see it.
[02:13:53.529 --> 02:13:54.029]  You find it?
[02:13:54.029 --> 02:13:54.589]  I've got it.
[02:13:54.589 --> 02:13:56.810]  I've got it queued up for you right there, Alex.
[02:13:56.810 --> 02:13:58.031]  Yeah, I'll cover the other numbers.
[02:13:58.031 --> 02:13:58.531]  You've got a whole...
[02:13:59.231 --> 02:14:00.992]  Tell people about your new phone.
[02:14:00.992 --> 02:14:01.793]  Tell people about the call.
[02:14:01.793 --> 02:14:02.553]  Tell them what happened.
[02:14:22.645 --> 02:14:25.648]  Well, yesterday, Alex, I was making some calls.
[02:14:25.648 --> 02:14:30.453]  I'm always dealing with advertising back there, so, you know, I'm making calls.
[02:14:30.453 --> 02:14:37.481]  And I received a call on my cell phone that I answered, but no one said anything.
[02:14:37.481 --> 02:14:38.122]  It was just like...
[02:14:39.724 --> 02:14:40.204]  I don't know.
[02:15:01.468 --> 02:15:05.092]  National Security Agency, Public Awareness Office, can I help you?
[02:15:05.092 --> 02:15:09.296]  And I'm like, I thought I was calling, I made a phone call the other day to the NRA.
[02:15:09.296 --> 02:15:12.720]  I thought I was calling back the NRA, you know, because I made a call to them.
[02:15:12.720 --> 02:15:16.964]  Well, no, it turns out she says, no, this is the National Security Agency, how can I help you?
[02:15:16.964 --> 02:15:20.308]  And I'm like, oh, well, I was just returning a phone call.
[02:15:22.166 --> 02:15:26.830]  And, uh, oh, well, no, sir, you know, this is the National Security Agency.
[02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:28.892]  You must have the wrong number.
[02:15:28.892 --> 02:15:31.334]  Oh, okay, well, all right, well, thank you.
[02:15:31.334 --> 02:15:32.955]  And, you know, I kind of hung up, freaked me out.
[02:15:32.955 --> 02:15:35.498]  I was like, whoa, now there's the weirdest call I've ever had.
[02:15:35.498 --> 02:15:36.879]  And then I came back in and we, uh...
[02:15:37.199 --> 02:15:51.523]  You just left when I returned that call, because that call came in before you came in, and then I returned the call just as you left, and yeah, I couldn't believe it was, you know, okay, so apparently now, you know, National Security Agency's got my cell phone number.
[02:15:51.523 --> 02:15:53.663]  And how, well, of course they're listening right now, probably.
[02:15:53.663 --> 02:15:55.524]  They can dial in even when the phone's off and listen.
[02:15:55.524 --> 02:16:00.145]  That's why when Bush would get people on Air Force One, everyone had to take the batteries out and put them in a bag.
[02:16:00.145 --> 02:16:04.306]  And they admit, well, other governments can dial in and listen to these, because we built back doors in them.
[02:16:05.026 --> 02:16:06.687]  I mean, it's just totally criminal, by the way.
[02:16:06.687 --> 02:16:08.648]  Each act of this is a felony.
[02:16:08.648 --> 02:16:09.529]  But they just don't care.
[02:16:09.529 --> 02:16:12.331]  They just, they grope small children.
[02:16:12.331 --> 02:16:13.212]  That's a felony.
[02:16:13.212 --> 02:16:13.492]  Yeah.
[02:16:13.492 --> 02:16:17.434]  And when the state of Texas says, we're going to stop you, they say, no, we're going to arrest you.
[02:16:17.434 --> 02:16:21.917]  All right, let's go ahead and dial this number here on air on this jam-packed show today.
[02:16:21.917 --> 02:16:27.201]  We're going to call the NSA number that we've called last night back twice and today twice.
[02:16:27.201 --> 02:16:28.382]  And we checked the number online.
[02:16:28.382 --> 02:16:34.406]  This is the NSA, the National Security Agency, there outside of Washington, D.C.
[02:16:35.907 --> 02:16:37.187]  Okay, here they are.
[02:16:37.187 --> 02:16:38.728]  Or maybe it's the new one in San Antonio.
[02:16:38.728 --> 02:16:41.730]  Maybe it's the new one outside Salt Lake City.
[02:16:41.730 --> 02:16:43.231]  I believe it was Fort Meade, Maryland.
[02:16:43.231 --> 02:16:45.052]  Ma'am, did you say NSA Public Affairs?
[02:16:49.879 --> 02:17:08.046]  Listen, I get phone calls occasionally from you guys at home and on my phone, and then my sales manager, general manager of my national publication, InfoWars Magazine, and I'm a syndicated radio talk show host, he got a call from the number.
[02:17:08.046 --> 02:17:10.267]  When he called it back, it's the NSA.
[02:17:10.267 --> 02:17:15.209]  Can you tell us who we need to talk to about the NSA that's calling us?
[02:17:15.209 --> 02:17:17.570]  Right, because sometimes they're not very friendly calls.
[02:17:19.242 --> 02:17:21.004]  I hope your dad dies.
[02:17:21.004 --> 02:17:22.947]  Very nice people.
[02:17:22.947 --> 02:17:24.368]  They like to let you know they're listening.
[02:17:24.368 --> 02:17:25.830]  They're good people.
[02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:27.592]  We're the bad guys because we don't like this.
[02:17:27.592 --> 02:17:30.175]  You know, Mom, Apple Pie, George Washington, Freedom.
[02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:31.336]  We're the bad guys.
[02:17:31.336 --> 02:17:33.158]  That's us.
[02:17:33.158 --> 02:17:38.164]  We don't run Al-Qaeda like the Pentagon publicly does or Amaral Al-Awlaki or all these guys.
[02:17:39.165 --> 02:17:39.746]  We're bad men.
[02:17:39.746 --> 02:17:40.847]  Yeah, terrorists.
[02:17:40.847 --> 02:17:41.668]  Yeah, we're bad.
[02:17:41.668 --> 02:17:43.669]  I mean, you know, so here we are.
[02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:44.590]  Hello NSA.
[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:45.471]  Hello, we're here.
[02:17:45.471 --> 02:17:46.772]  We know you're already listening anyways.
[02:17:46.772 --> 02:17:47.773]  That's the whole point of this phone call.
[02:17:47.773 --> 02:17:48.994]  They're already listening.
[02:17:48.994 --> 02:17:49.935]  They're listening to radio.
[02:17:49.935 --> 02:17:51.096]  They're listening to the transmissions.
[02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:52.538]  They're listening to us on XM.
[02:17:52.538 --> 02:17:54.279]  They're listening on your cell phone right now.
[02:17:54.279 --> 02:17:55.420]  Yeah, they can hear us right now.
[02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:56.802]  Just tapped in right now.
[02:17:57.262 --> 02:17:59.003]  Good afternoon, how may I help you?
[02:17:59.003 --> 02:18:02.125]  Hi ma'am, is this... Who is this with the NSA?
[02:18:02.125 --> 02:18:03.326]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:18:03.326 --> 02:18:04.707]  Transmitting worldwide.
[02:18:04.707 --> 02:18:06.428]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:18:06.428 --> 02:18:10.150]  Your number keeps calling me and calling crew members of our office.
[02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:11.571]  We can give you the phone records of that.
[02:18:11.571 --> 02:18:13.712]  Why is the NSA calling us?
[02:18:13.712 --> 02:18:17.114]  Sir, the National Security Agency has been calling you.
[02:18:17.114 --> 02:18:18.335]  Oh, we're imagining it?
[02:18:18.335 --> 02:18:20.957]  Just like we were imagining you're spying on everybody without warrants?
[02:18:22.841 --> 02:18:25.763]  Sir, you contacted the National Security Agency.
[02:18:25.763 --> 02:18:27.765]  Is there something I can do for you?
[02:18:27.765 --> 02:18:30.787]  Well, I guess you control reality like Karl Rove said, ma'am.
[02:18:30.787 --> 02:18:32.108]  You won't tell us your name.
[02:18:32.108 --> 02:18:33.289]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:18:33.289 --> 02:18:36.232]  We're telling you... Alex, first of all, let's stop.
[02:18:36.232 --> 02:18:42.617]  You never even gave me a chance to really tell you who I was, if I was going to answer your question or not.
[02:18:43.317 --> 02:18:46.021]  Again, happy to help, but if you're... Well, you're very sweet, ma'am.
[02:18:46.021 --> 02:18:46.662]  Well, thank you, then.
[02:18:46.662 --> 02:18:47.643]  Let's start over.
[02:18:47.643 --> 02:18:49.646]  I'm broadcasting worldwide right now.
[02:18:49.646 --> 02:18:50.286]  Okay.
[02:18:50.286 --> 02:18:55.213]  The NSA called one of my newspaper general manager's number.
[02:18:55.213 --> 02:18:56.875]  It was dead air with beeping.
[02:18:56.875 --> 02:19:00.640]  He called them back, and then they said, no, we didn't call you, but we have the phone.
[02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:01.341]  We have the record.
[02:19:02.634 --> 02:19:03.695]  Okay, sir.
[02:19:03.695 --> 02:19:05.316]  I wasn't the one that took that call.
[02:19:05.316 --> 02:19:06.998]  I have no way of knowing.
[02:19:06.998 --> 02:19:10.501]  Happy to take your information and happy to have it looked into.
[02:19:10.501 --> 02:19:11.642]  Oh, please.
[02:19:11.642 --> 02:19:12.923]  Well, okay, I've got to go off here.
[02:19:12.923 --> 02:19:14.845]  I don't want to give you my... Well, I guess you've already got my number.
[02:19:14.845 --> 02:19:16.386]  Can't you just have the guys call me?
[02:19:16.386 --> 02:19:17.787]  I mean, they're already listening right now.
[02:19:17.787 --> 02:19:18.528]  Call my number.
[02:19:18.528 --> 02:19:21.030]  You've got Russell Dowden's number here in Austin, Texas.
[02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:24.193]  Can you just ask whoever is calling him to give us another call?
[02:19:24.193 --> 02:19:24.713]  Tell us their name?
[02:19:29.057 --> 02:19:35.022]  Well, you're very sweet, ma'am, and I know you're just... I mean, what are you, just an operator or a public relations person?
[02:19:36.926 --> 02:19:38.147]  Well, that's very nice of you.
[02:19:38.147 --> 02:19:45.834]  We're going to go to break here then, and I will give you my cell phone number, though the NSA doesn't need it.
[02:19:45.834 --> 02:19:49.137]  So we're going to go to break right here.
[02:19:49.137 --> 02:19:55.042]  I'm going to talk to you off air and give you my number, and maybe we can get your name and stuff, and it would be very nice if someone would call me back.
[02:19:55.042 --> 02:19:56.484]  Well, you already have the phone record.
[02:19:56.484 --> 02:19:59.887]  I want to find out who's either spoofing the number or if the NSA's calling me.
[02:20:00.487 --> 02:20:02.088]  Because I also get other calls.
[02:20:02.088 --> 02:20:05.450]  HempUSA.org brings you pure camembert powder.

[02:20:31.987 --> 02:20:36.551]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:20:36.551 --> 02:20:42.356]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:20:42.356 --> 02:20:45.739]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:24:02.011 --> 02:24:10.894]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:22.550]  Her name was Levina?
[02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:24.051]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:24.051 --> 02:24:25.231]  So go ahead and turn Russell on.
[02:24:25.231 --> 02:24:25.851]  We're back live.
[02:24:25.851 --> 02:24:27.532]  We've got in-studio guests coming up.
[02:24:27.532 --> 02:24:32.134]  The children now wearing satellite trackers, RFID trackers.
[02:24:32.134 --> 02:24:36.556]  They have Pentagon cameras in San Antonio as well that watch the kids eat their food.
[02:24:36.556 --> 02:24:38.497]  Because the Pentagon wants to know how they eat their food.
[02:24:38.497 --> 02:24:40.718]  That's Associated Press, if you think I'm joking.
[02:24:40.718 --> 02:24:41.578]  It's no big deal.
[02:24:41.578 --> 02:24:42.839]  I mean, everything's fine.
[02:24:42.839 --> 02:24:43.559]  Nothing to worry about.
[02:24:45.063 --> 02:24:51.925]  That's like they say in Caddyshack, you know, nothing to worry about Mr. Governor, just a harmless animal, not plastic explosives or anything.
[02:24:51.925 --> 02:24:55.906]  You know, everything's fine, the government's arming itself with the teeth, 1.4 billion bullets.
[02:24:55.906 --> 02:25:00.028]  We just talked to that lady and she said her name was Levina, public information officer.
[02:25:00.028 --> 02:25:01.568]  Everyone's an officer but us.
[02:25:01.568 --> 02:25:03.829]  It's a new class thing, we're just scum citizen.
[02:25:03.829 --> 02:25:09.751]  But she was nice, and I was like, well you know somebody could be spoofing this if it's not you, you know, your office calling.
[02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:12.872]  Probably somebody in the NSA or somebody in their private database spoofing us.
[02:25:14.338 --> 02:25:16.720]  And I'm trying to tell the NSA this is going on.
[02:25:16.720 --> 02:25:20.643]  Yeah, well we gave them our number, my number, and... And the time they called.
[02:25:20.643 --> 02:25:22.904]  And the time they called, they already had the number.
[02:25:22.904 --> 02:25:23.785]  Actually, pull that up again.
[02:25:23.785 --> 02:25:25.966]  You've got the whole list of your calls back to them, too.
[02:25:25.966 --> 02:25:26.347]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:26.347 --> 02:25:27.227]  You've got the incoming.
[02:25:27.227 --> 02:25:29.969]  The incoming was actually at 1230-something.
[02:25:29.969 --> 02:25:30.670]  Yes, let me find it.
[02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:34.713]  And then you never called it back until later, so that's why you figured it out like 4 o'clock.
[02:25:34.713 --> 02:25:35.373]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:35.373 --> 02:25:37.695]  I figured it out about, yeah, about 3 or 4 o'clock we realized.
[02:25:37.695 --> 02:25:38.175]  Well, let me see it.
[02:25:38.175 --> 02:25:39.816]  You just had the whole call history pulled up.
[02:25:39.816 --> 02:25:40.397]  Let me see here.
[02:25:40.397 --> 02:25:40.937]  Let's find it.
[02:25:40.937 --> 02:25:42.078]  What'd you think of that conversation?
[02:25:43.496 --> 02:25:44.718]  Creepy.
[02:25:44.718 --> 02:25:47.081]  Creepy that they got my number.
[02:25:47.081 --> 02:25:52.227]  We gave them my number, again, just to make sure that they had the right number.
[02:25:52.227 --> 02:25:59.957]  And, again, Levina from the NSA, very polite lady, but we had to give her my number so that she knew the right number.
[02:26:00.898 --> 02:26:06.762]  Uh, to look up and why they called and to see, you know, what the deal is.
[02:26:06.762 --> 02:26:07.703]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:26:07.703 --> 02:26:12.666]  Apparently I'm a terrorist now and running the magazine over here at InfoWars.
[02:26:12.666 --> 02:26:14.727]  And, uh, yeah.
[02:26:14.727 --> 02:26:17.009]  Gotta get after me there, I guess, Alex.
[02:26:17.009 --> 02:26:20.071]  Well, you work somewhere where we got George Washington hanging on the wall, pal.
[02:26:20.071 --> 02:26:21.792]  Yeah, I'm an evil terrorist.
[02:26:21.792 --> 02:26:23.993]  Doesn't get any worse than that in America.
[02:26:23.993 --> 02:26:24.453]  God forbid.
[02:26:24.453 --> 02:26:27.055]  The bankers don't cotton to that, boy.
[02:26:27.055 --> 02:26:28.436]  No, it's awful.
[02:26:28.436 --> 02:26:29.717]  They've announced this is their country now.
[02:26:30.506 --> 02:26:36.875]  Yeah, they've taken over and, you know, I guess I'm a threat to national security.
[02:26:36.875 --> 02:26:37.356]  I don't know.
[02:26:37.356 --> 02:26:40.741]  Because the national security is banker-run, and you are a threat to them.
[02:26:40.741 --> 02:26:41.562]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:26:41.562 --> 02:26:44.046]  You're an American, and a good American is a bad American.
[02:26:44.471 --> 02:26:47.352]  Yeah, and apparently we're just, I'm on the watch list now.
[02:26:47.352 --> 02:26:59.397]  You're motivated, you're focused, you're not a jellyfish, you're not a slave, you're working for liberty, you're working for sovereignty, you're working for the family, you're working for health, you're working for truth, you're working for justice, you're the bad man.
[02:26:59.397 --> 02:27:00.697]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:27:00.697 --> 02:27:04.979]  So, thank you very much NSA, it was good to hear from you, I don't know what it was about.
[02:27:04.979 --> 02:27:07.020]  Did you find the whole call history?
[02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:09.341]  I'm trying to itemize it right here, it's underneath
[02:27:10.066 --> 02:27:11.026]  Yeah, I got a new phone.
[02:27:11.026 --> 02:27:11.927]  When did you get that?
[02:27:11.927 --> 02:27:22.530]  I got this phone like a few weeks ago and the thing is Alex, you know, normally if I, you know, if you get a call, oh here we go, yesterday, and then you go to call, uh, more calls from NSA.
[02:27:22.530 --> 02:27:24.551]  Let me see it.
[02:27:24.551 --> 02:27:25.391]  Here, show that guys.
[02:27:27.031 --> 02:27:27.692]  Show this to folks.
[02:27:27.692 --> 02:27:42.083]  The blue one on the bottom is the incoming call, and the first few times that I was trying to call them, well, call back, you know, you pull up the number on the phone and it actually dials the number on this new phone.
[02:27:42.083 --> 02:27:48.708]  I'm still figuring out this phone, but if you look there on the bottom, the blue is the incoming call that came in at 12.32 p.m.
[02:27:48.708 --> 02:27:50.249]  and I called back at 1.31 p.m.
[02:27:50.249 --> 02:27:50.609]  yesterday
[02:27:52.951 --> 02:27:55.233]  The 301 number.
[02:27:55.233 --> 02:28:05.440]  So, and then a few times I looked it up, you know, I was talking with Wes yesterday and, you know, the few times that you try to pull the number up, it was actually dialing the number back.
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.481]  So I wasn't trying to call back that many times.
[02:28:07.481 --> 02:28:09.483]  It's just, I'm still figuring out this new phone.
[02:28:09.483 --> 02:28:13.786]  And Alex, this is the new AT&T HTC One X phone.
[02:28:14.446 --> 02:28:24.017]  A lot of what happens is when they've got a tap on the phone, which isn't a tap, it's just all, they're hardwired in and all the, as AT&T execs have said, there's whole buildings at AT&T where they spy on you.
[02:28:24.017 --> 02:28:28.442]  A lot of times when there's a tap on it, sometimes the number will dial it.
[02:28:28.442 --> 02:28:32.427]  But hey, you haven't gotten the call yet, you know, where they tell you, hey, we're listening to you.
[02:28:32.427 --> 02:28:35.190]  Now, you know, the funny thing is... That's really cool though, I kind of like that.
[02:28:35.370 --> 02:28:36.692]  I came aboard.
[02:28:36.692 --> 02:28:39.415]  Alex said, hey, this might happen, Russell.
[02:28:39.415 --> 02:28:44.001]  I've known you a long time, but don't be shocked if you get a phone call one day.
[02:28:44.001 --> 02:28:45.883]  And I kind of took that with a grain of salt.
[02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:47.045]  I mean, OK, Alex.
[02:28:47.045 --> 02:28:48.126]  No, I mean, they'll tell you.
[02:28:48.126 --> 02:28:50.609]  They'll tell you I'm going to chop your head off.
[02:28:50.609 --> 02:28:51.931]  Well, you know, this has happened to me on...
[02:28:53.652 --> 02:28:59.535]  Radio shows I've done or broadcasts I've done where, you know, Jim Mars' call will get dropped and things like that.
[02:28:59.535 --> 02:29:02.297]  Not so much on my phone, though.
[02:29:02.297 --> 02:29:03.137]  That was really different.
[02:29:03.137 --> 02:29:05.979]  Yeah, well, I mean, you can chalk all that up to paranoia.
[02:29:05.979 --> 02:29:06.519]  Yeah.
[02:29:06.519 --> 02:29:12.443]  But when they call up and say, you're just protesting Bilderberg, they call your wife and say, oh, I'm glad your family member's in the hospital.
[02:29:13.343 --> 02:29:14.504]  Or, you know, a woman calls.
[02:29:14.504 --> 02:29:19.288]  And then once they figure out that you're not buying it, then they'll say, we're listening to you!
[02:29:19.288 --> 02:29:21.289]  I mean, it's just over the... it's like supposed to freak you out.
[02:29:21.289 --> 02:29:26.633]  That's just... That's supposed to run like people in, you know, in these movies like Enemy of the State, just run in fear.
[02:29:26.633 --> 02:29:27.914]  In fact, do we have the Enemy of the State trailer?
[02:29:27.914 --> 02:29:30.837]  I want to play that when we introduce this amazing family.
[02:29:32.130 --> 02:29:33.151]  Great job, Russell.
[02:29:33.151 --> 02:29:36.373]  We've got the Hernandez family coming in here.
[02:29:36.373 --> 02:29:37.014]  Amazing people.
[02:29:37.014 --> 02:29:38.335]  I haven't got a chance to fully meet yet.
[02:29:38.335 --> 02:29:38.915]  I feel rude.
[02:29:38.915 --> 02:29:41.557]  I've been running around like a chicken with my head cut off.
[02:29:41.557 --> 02:29:42.638]  Isn't this exciting?
[02:29:42.638 --> 02:29:45.380]  To be fighting for liberty, and they're proving they're evil.
[02:29:45.380 --> 02:29:46.902]  They're proving you're right.
[02:29:46.902 --> 02:29:48.163]  They're convicting themselves.
[02:29:48.163 --> 02:29:50.504]  It's a good feeling, and I mean... We're out of time.
[02:29:50.504 --> 02:29:50.825]  Out of time.
[02:29:50.825 --> 02:29:52.166]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.166 --> 02:29:53.787]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.787 --> 02:29:57.390]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.354 --> 02:30:05.017]  For thousands of years, silver has been used as both a medicine and a preservative.
[02:30:05.017 --> 02:30:06.778]  But not all silver is equal.
[02:30:06.778 --> 02:30:13.523]  SilverSol is an amazing new technology that has been clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloid or ionic silvers.
[02:30:13.523 --> 02:30:16.925]  It can destroy thousands of times more pathogens than older silver technology.
[02:30:17.285 --> 02:30:25.109]  Silversol resonates at the same frequency as germicidal light used in labs to kill bacteria and viruses, enabling it to kill without direct contact.
[02:30:25.109 --> 02:30:32.233]  Silversol is a broad-spectrum microbial that creates no resistance and does not harm beneficial bacteria, making it ideal for daily use.
[02:30:32.233 --> 02:30:37.396]  It can be used internally as well as topically, and is highly effective against viruses, bacterias, molds, and yeasts.
[02:30:37.876 --> 02:30:44.401]  With threats like West Nile virus, colds, flus, or any other emergency situation, arm yourself with Supernatural Silver.
[02:30:44.401 --> 02:30:50.345]  Silver Sol Liquid and Gel are perfect for on-the-go emergency preparedness and can provide protection at home, school, or work.

[02:32:01.107 --> 02:32:07.250]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[02:32:07.250 --> 02:32:10.211]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[02:32:10.211 --> 02:32:15.613]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:32:15.613 --> 02:32:20.575]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:32:20.575 --> 02:32:24.337]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's
[02:32:24.457 --> 02:32:24.857]  We're good.
[02:32:40.802 --> 02:32:43.565]  The fact is, you can eat it anytime to save money today.
[02:32:43.565 --> 02:32:48.130]  And because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:32:48.130 --> 02:32:48.791]  Don't wait!
[02:32:48.791 --> 02:32:50.672]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:50.672 --> 02:32:52.254]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:32:52.254 --> 02:32:53.796]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[02:33:20.571 --> 02:33:20.731]  Hi.
[02:33:20.731 --> 02:33:21.291]  Hey, hi.
[02:33:21.291 --> 02:33:23.672]  So you want some lingerie for your wife?
[02:33:23.672 --> 02:33:25.313]  Uh, yes.
[02:33:25.313 --> 02:33:28.314]  I'm not really experienced in this.
[02:33:28.314 --> 02:33:29.415]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[02:33:29.415 --> 02:33:30.775]  I mean, I'm experienced.
[02:33:30.775 --> 02:33:33.937]  You know, I don't want to come in here and look stupid.
[02:33:33.937 --> 02:33:34.357]  Too late.
[02:33:34.357 --> 02:33:38.398]  Should have gotten her a watch.
[02:33:38.398 --> 02:33:41.199]  Robert Clayton Dean was innocent.
[02:33:41.199 --> 02:33:42.940]  Raise their arms ten.
[02:33:42.940 --> 02:33:46.822]  We have reason to believe that Mr. Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you.
[02:33:46.822 --> 02:33:47.942]  What kind of materials?
[02:33:47.942 --> 02:33:48.622]  Sensitive soap.
[02:33:48.622 --> 02:33:49.463]  Let's get into his life.
[02:33:50.684 --> 02:33:53.027]  Have you bugged it, Mr. Dean?
[02:33:53.027 --> 02:33:53.988]  Move to audio three?
[02:33:53.988 --> 02:33:55.269]  He was unsuspecting.
[02:33:55.269 --> 02:33:55.669]  Hey, hey!
[02:33:55.669 --> 02:33:57.531]  Am I in the wrong house?
[02:33:57.531 --> 02:33:58.352]  Hello?
[02:33:58.352 --> 02:34:00.454]  Eric!
[02:34:00.454 --> 02:34:01.035]  Mr. Dean!
[02:34:01.035 --> 02:34:02.136]  He was unaware.
[02:34:02.136 --> 02:34:04.558]  You are the only woman in the world for me.
[02:34:04.558 --> 02:34:06.160]  You and Janet Jackson.
[02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:08.042]  I mean, you're way over.
[02:34:08.042 --> 02:34:11.225]  Now, what he doesn't know... I'd like to report a break-in.
[02:34:11.225 --> 02:34:12.106]  ...could kill him.
[02:34:13.445 --> 02:34:15.746]  Keyhole visual tasking, maximum resolution.
[02:34:15.746 --> 02:34:16.946]  He's on your six o'clock!
[02:34:16.946 --> 02:34:18.127]  You have something they want!
[02:34:18.127 --> 02:34:18.687]  Two targets, rooftop.
[02:34:18.687 --> 02:34:19.807]  I don't have anything!
[02:34:19.807 --> 02:34:21.948]  Maybe you do and you don't know it!
[02:34:21.948 --> 02:34:22.789]  You're a threat now.
[02:34:22.789 --> 02:34:23.449]  To whom?
[02:34:23.449 --> 02:34:24.089]  Everyone you know.
[02:34:24.089 --> 02:34:24.929]  Target's on the move.
[02:34:24.929 --> 02:34:25.850]  A name, a phone number?
[02:34:25.850 --> 02:34:26.570]  No, nothing!
[02:34:26.570 --> 02:34:27.390]  He didn't give me anything!
[02:34:27.390 --> 02:34:33.693]  You know how many federal agents you have following you?
[02:34:33.693 --> 02:34:35.393]  Stay exactly where you are.
[02:34:35.393 --> 02:34:37.614]  We'll use every means possible to get what we need.
[02:34:37.614 --> 02:34:38.595]  From Jerry Bruckheimer.
[02:34:38.595 --> 02:34:39.315]  Get the cat.
[02:34:39.315 --> 02:34:40.315]  What's the cat's name?
[02:34:40.315 --> 02:34:40.776]  Babe!
[02:34:40.776 --> 02:34:41.676]  Producer of The Rock.
[02:34:42.862 --> 02:34:43.783]  Come here, baby.
[02:34:43.783 --> 02:34:44.584]  Baby, come, come.
[02:34:44.584 --> 02:34:45.124]  Come here!
[02:34:45.124 --> 02:34:46.605]  A film by Tony Scott.
[02:34:46.605 --> 02:34:47.886]  Target is on 21.
[02:34:47.886 --> 02:34:49.247]  Director of Crimson Ties.
[02:34:49.247 --> 02:34:49.888]  It's about me.
[02:34:49.888 --> 02:34:49.928]  20.
[02:34:49.928 --> 02:34:51.709]  Do they know me?
[02:34:51.709 --> 02:34:52.670]  19.
[02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:53.230]  Who is that?
[02:34:53.230 --> 02:34:53.270]  18.
[02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:55.112]  They jumped to 17.
[02:34:55.112 --> 02:34:55.952]  Do they know me?
[02:34:55.952 --> 02:34:59.115]  I don't know what you're talking about!
[02:34:59.115 --> 02:34:59.835]  Will Smith.
[02:34:59.835 --> 02:35:01.236]  You're one of them, aren't you?
[02:35:01.236 --> 02:35:02.497]  Former conspirer.
[02:35:02.497 --> 02:35:02.897]  Swing it!
[02:35:02.897 --> 02:35:04.539]  Swing it!
[02:35:04.539 --> 02:35:05.279]  Gene Hackman.
[02:35:05.279 --> 02:35:06.740]  This man, this is our problem.
[02:35:06.740 --> 02:35:08.442]  You live another day, I'll be very impressed.
[02:35:08.442 --> 02:35:11.344]  It's not paranoia when they're really after you.
[02:35:13.136 --> 02:35:16.538]  Phone is stopping now!
[02:35:16.538 --> 02:35:18.360]  Enemy of the State.
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:20.642]  What the hell is happening?
[02:35:20.642 --> 02:35:21.843]  I blew up the building!
[02:35:21.843 --> 02:35:22.523]  Why?
[02:35:22.523 --> 02:35:27.688]  Because you made a phone call!
[02:35:27.688 --> 02:35:31.070]  Alright, Enemy of the State, and we have the NSA calling us.
[02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:32.952]  And then, sir, the NSA didn't call you.
[02:35:32.952 --> 02:35:35.114]  Yeah, or somebody spoofed your phone number.
[02:35:36.161 --> 02:35:41.308]  And believe me, I've gotten the calls where they tell you what you've been talking about, where they want you to know they're listening.
[02:35:41.308 --> 02:35:46.355]  And that's either another agency, or Merck groups dialed in there, or it's the NSA.
[02:35:46.355 --> 02:35:50.060]  But that's just a cut-out group for all these private corporations to use it.
[02:35:50.060 --> 02:35:52.163]  The government people actually aren't even let in on much.
[02:35:53.324 --> 02:35:54.805]  A bunch of foreign governments run it.
[02:35:54.805 --> 02:35:58.686]  It is such treason that they announce on the news, foreign banks now run this country.
[02:35:58.686 --> 02:35:59.746]  I can play the clips right now.
[02:35:59.746 --> 02:36:02.707]  I want my country back right now.
[02:36:02.707 --> 02:36:03.768]  That's what I want.
[02:36:03.768 --> 02:36:05.908]  I don't want to live in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia.
[02:36:05.908 --> 02:36:06.929]  We know what tyranny is.
[02:36:07.972 --> 02:36:10.714]  And folks, people say, well, just don't fight the system.
[02:36:10.714 --> 02:36:11.674]  You'll be left alone.
[02:36:11.674 --> 02:36:14.256]  They want tyranny because they want to take your pension funds.
[02:36:14.256 --> 02:36:15.356]  They want to raise your taxes.
[02:36:15.356 --> 02:36:16.897]  They want to run your life.
[02:36:16.897 --> 02:36:19.999]  When you let freedom go away, you lose the prosperity.
[02:36:19.999 --> 02:36:25.322]  Now, I've got people that I tell you are my new heroes, Andrea Hernandez and Steve Hernandez.
[02:36:26.653 --> 02:36:33.818]  Because their children or their child go to a school where they're trying to give them satellite tracker boxes.
[02:36:33.818 --> 02:36:36.160]  They've got RFID going in.
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:40.483]  Also in San Antonio, Department of Defense cameras that watch the food that children eat.
[02:36:40.483 --> 02:36:40.984]  Don't believe me?
[02:36:40.984 --> 02:36:44.726]  Just type in cameras, you know, track what children eat in San Antonio schools.
[02:36:44.726 --> 02:36:47.128]  It's the Department of Defense DARPA program.
[02:36:47.128 --> 02:36:50.191]  They're trying to have them as lab rats to train them to be prisoners.
[02:36:50.191 --> 02:36:52.352]  And they said they'd come on the phone.
[02:36:52.352 --> 02:36:54.274]  I said, we've only got like 20 minutes for you.
[02:36:54.274 --> 02:36:55.475]  And they said, well, we'll still drive up.
[02:36:56.275 --> 02:36:58.936]  So they're very gracious to come up here on short notice.
[02:36:58.936 --> 02:37:01.037]  I could talk to them for five hours if we had the time.
[02:37:01.037 --> 02:37:06.339]  In fact, I'm tempted to go over there after the show and type a show for the Nightly News, but I've got other meetings set up.
[02:37:06.339 --> 02:37:07.500]  But they join us.
[02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:11.622]  Here are the headlines out of WAI-TV and radio.
[02:37:11.622 --> 02:37:12.002]  Poll.
[02:37:12.002 --> 02:37:15.203]  Parents and students oppose new school tracking device.
[02:37:15.203 --> 02:37:16.004]  World Net Daily.
[02:37:16.004 --> 02:37:18.185]  Rebellion erupts over school student shipping plan.
[02:37:19.170 --> 02:37:20.531]  I'm continuing here.
[02:37:20.531 --> 02:37:22.713]  I mean, it's just big national news.
[02:37:22.713 --> 02:37:26.817]  And here they are, Steve Hernandez and his wife.
[02:37:26.817 --> 02:37:28.098]  Guys, tell us about yourselves.
[02:37:28.098 --> 02:37:33.242]  Tell us about your son who's here and why you guys are doing this.
[02:37:33.242 --> 02:37:35.945]  This is my daughter, Andrea, and this is my son, Vincent.
[02:37:37.106 --> 02:37:39.130]  So we were unable to get your wife in with us?
[02:37:39.130 --> 02:37:40.412]  Yeah, my wife wasn't able to make it today.
[02:37:40.412 --> 02:37:42.516]  I mean, that's why I thought, wow, his wife looks really young.
[02:37:42.516 --> 02:37:48.306]  Now listen, I've been so busy, you see me running around in here during the breaks, that I just met you right as you came in here.
[02:37:48.306 --> 02:37:48.927]  So I thought, yes...
[02:37:50.239 --> 02:37:52.681]  Can I see quotes of your wife here fighting as well in the news?
[02:37:52.681 --> 02:37:53.141]  Absolutely.
[02:37:53.141 --> 02:37:57.044]  Okay, well tell us about you and your wife and why you're concerned.
[02:37:57.044 --> 02:38:08.192]  Yeah, my wife and I, when we saw this letter that came out on August 10th from John Jay High School, it said they were going to start putting these new smart IDs out to her, with chips in her, tracking chips.
[02:38:08.192 --> 02:38:10.514]  And the first thing that came to my mind was Revelations.
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:16.082]  Because in Revelations, it says you cannot buy or sell without the mark from the beast.
[02:38:16.082 --> 02:38:18.303]  Well, we know this isn't the mark of the beast.
[02:38:18.303 --> 02:38:20.044]  We know that this is the conditioning of it.
[02:38:20.044 --> 02:38:23.466]  They're trying to condition the people into thinking this is normal.
[02:38:23.466 --> 02:38:24.867]  This is the norm.
[02:38:24.867 --> 02:38:30.349]  And because of our religious beliefs, we said, no, we're not going to allow my daughter to wear that tracking device.
[02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:35.772]  And my son goes to NISD school, but he's not being tracked at this moment.
[02:38:35.772 --> 02:38:39.874]  But that's what I'm fighting for, not just for my children, but for every student out there, every parent.
[02:38:40.868 --> 02:38:43.853]  There's a lot of people out there who are misinformed.
[02:38:43.853 --> 02:38:45.175]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:38:45.175 --> 02:38:48.440]  They're just saying, you know, it's a great idea, let's go ahead and do it.
[02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:53.188]  NISD has a stronghold, it's a stronghold over parents and teachers and students.
[02:38:55.026 --> 02:38:58.750]  They really, it's hard to really... Because they're turning it into a prison.
[02:38:58.750 --> 02:39:03.194]  I mean you have Department of Defense, you've seen that on the news where they have the cameras watching what they eat?
[02:39:03.194 --> 02:39:03.815]  Yes sir.
[02:39:03.815 --> 02:39:08.319]  And it's an AI computer that can tell how many calories you get watching you eat an apple?
[02:39:08.319 --> 02:39:09.841]  Yes sir, absolutely.
[02:39:09.841 --> 02:39:16.007]  And that's another thing we're concerned about because they're trying to take out certain kind of machines out of the schools and put in this kind of machine.
[02:39:17.208 --> 02:39:20.369]  Make the kids of something they want them to be.
[02:39:20.369 --> 02:39:24.050]  They're not letting these children be free and to be themselves.
[02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:27.550]  They're saying children shouldn't even play at the park now, they're saying.
[02:39:27.550 --> 02:39:34.232]  And they're not only should they play at the park, they shouldn't be, they can opt out of gym class now and all these other things.
[02:39:34.232 --> 02:39:35.092]  This is ridiculous.
[02:39:35.092 --> 02:39:35.572]  I've seen that.
[02:39:35.572 --> 02:39:39.653]  Yeah, you're not supposed to have dodgeball or run at recess.
[02:39:39.773 --> 02:39:42.495]  Yeah, because it interferes with their learning capability.
[02:39:42.495 --> 02:39:43.395]  Tell us about your son.
[02:39:43.395 --> 02:39:44.836]  I mean, you've got your son, your daughter here.
[02:39:44.836 --> 02:39:46.557]  You brought some family as well today.
[02:39:46.557 --> 02:39:52.121]  I mean, tell us the experience they've had and why they're here.
[02:39:52.121 --> 02:40:00.066]  My son is here to support us, and Vinny's been out there with us 100%, pushing this idea and telling us, hey, look, this is not fair.
[02:40:00.066 --> 02:40:01.466]  And you didn't ask us.
[02:40:01.466 --> 02:40:02.807]  You just put this out there.
[02:40:02.807 --> 02:40:06.530]  And I don't want my son, when it comes to his school, supposedly when it comes to his school,
[02:40:07.390 --> 02:40:09.591]  If it does go to his school, he's not going to wear the chip either.
[02:40:09.591 --> 02:40:12.373]  Well, if they get away with this, they can do anything.
[02:40:12.373 --> 02:40:13.934]  And they're saying they want to make people do this.
[02:40:13.934 --> 02:40:14.835]  This is incredible.
[02:40:14.835 --> 02:40:17.756]  And what's crazy here, this program costs $525,000 just for two schools.
[02:40:20.677 --> 02:40:27.081]  There's 112 schools in the district, and it costs $136,000 a year to run the program.
[02:40:27.081 --> 02:40:31.564]  It's pure military industrial complex profiteering boondoggle.
[02:40:31.564 --> 02:40:32.825]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:40:32.825 --> 02:40:33.826]  Well, I mean, you're the expert on this.
[02:40:33.826 --> 02:40:36.888]  Tell us all about it, and anytime your son or daughter want to pop in.
[02:40:36.888 --> 02:40:37.488]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:40:37.488 --> 02:40:38.729]  Go ahead, baby.
[02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:43.113]  Yeah, you know, these ideas, they're completely useless.
[02:40:43.113 --> 02:40:47.336]  You know, I think it's a waste of all the money that we've been giving to the school for so many years.
[02:40:47.336 --> 02:40:49.779]  You know, you're just going to take my money and use it to track me?
[02:40:49.779 --> 02:40:50.940]  I already go to school.
[02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:52.521]  You have cameras every five feet.
[02:40:52.521 --> 02:40:56.165]  You know, you have security guides and you have your admin out in the hallways.
[02:40:56.165 --> 02:40:57.966]  You know, that's enough protection as it is.
[02:40:57.966 --> 02:40:58.647]  Protection?
[02:40:58.647 --> 02:41:00.809]  Well, guys, can you pull up the Eisenhower quote?
[02:41:00.809 --> 02:41:04.412]  He said, he said, safety, if you want safety, go to prison.
[02:41:04.412 --> 02:41:04.612]  I mean,
[02:41:05.553 --> 02:41:06.874]  This is the opposite of safety.
[02:41:06.874 --> 02:41:09.617]  A government trying to make you wear tracker chips.
[02:41:09.617 --> 02:41:14.341]  Some of the schools down there, and in Texas, they want a GPS unit.
[02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:15.522]  Tell us about this.
[02:41:15.522 --> 02:41:16.423]  You have two of them.
[02:41:16.423 --> 02:41:18.145]  We can document, Cam, this.
[02:41:18.145 --> 02:41:21.588]  This one is the new tracking chip badge, and this one is their old one.
[02:41:21.588 --> 02:41:24.330]  They're trying to say this one's going to make things safer for everybody.
[02:41:24.330 --> 02:41:26.472]  I don't understand how it's going to make anybody safer.
[02:41:26.472 --> 02:41:27.654]  I really don't.
[02:41:27.654 --> 02:41:28.995]  I don't see how it makes people safer.
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:38.849]  Wade Garcia was on Katherine Albert's radio show, okay, from spychips.com, and said, hey, this never shuts off.
[02:41:38.849 --> 02:41:40.831]  It's always emitting a signal.
[02:41:40.831 --> 02:41:47.158]  Well, they caught him in San Francisco, where not just the toll roads, but everywhere they put up readers to track the toll road chip.
[02:41:47.158 --> 02:41:48.019]  In fact, there it is, guys.
[02:41:48.019 --> 02:41:49.080]  We got a document cam on that.
[02:41:50.418 --> 02:41:51.980]  There it is.
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:53.882]  Keep telling us about it, Mr. Hernandez.
[02:41:53.882 --> 02:42:00.770]  You know, and the reason I said this reminds me of Revelations, because she can't even go to school and buy her lunch.
[02:42:00.770 --> 02:42:02.251]  Unless she has this.
[02:42:02.251 --> 02:42:06.035]  Kids are being bribed with candy and gifts to wear it around their necks.
[02:42:07.052 --> 02:42:08.914]  They're encouraged to wear it around their necks.
[02:42:08.914 --> 02:42:17.200]  And then they were also told that they cannot hold leadership positions in school if they don't wear the shirt.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:22.505]  So now it's discrimination against Christians, or people that don't want to live with a prisoner badge.
[02:42:22.505 --> 02:42:22.845]  Absolutely.
[02:42:22.845 --> 02:42:25.787]  I mean, imagine what Hitler would have done with something like this.
[02:42:25.787 --> 02:42:27.669]  Oh yeah, it would have been worse.
[02:42:27.669 --> 02:42:29.771]  It would have been worse than what happened.
[02:42:29.771 --> 02:42:36.236]  Andrea does want to share some new information that came to us yesterday, and it came straight from her bus driver.
[02:42:36.653 --> 02:42:41.338]  Yeah, my bus driver, I was on the bus and, um, there's this big ol' grey box and I was like, sir, what is that for?
[02:42:41.338 --> 02:42:42.679]  He goes, oh, that's for the security cameras.
[02:42:42.679 --> 02:42:43.780]  And I was like, okay.
[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:47.203]  And then there's this little black bar and it's right above the bus driver's window.
[02:42:47.203 --> 02:42:48.545]  And I was like, sir, what does that do?
[02:42:48.545 --> 02:42:50.026]  He goes, oh, that's for that home project.
[02:42:50.026 --> 02:42:51.127]  And I was like, what are you talking about, sir?
[02:42:51.127 --> 02:42:52.428]  He goes, you know, your badges.
[02:42:52.428 --> 02:42:55.071]  And I was like, so I get trapped on the bus?
[02:42:55.071 --> 02:42:55.411]  He goes, yep.
[02:42:56.294 --> 02:42:58.576]  So they tracked me on the bus as well.
[02:42:58.576 --> 02:42:59.516]  But then lied.
[02:42:59.516 --> 02:43:01.118]  They were in the news saying we don't track you.
[02:43:01.118 --> 02:43:03.700]  Tell folks about that because we're the enemy.
[02:43:03.700 --> 02:43:06.041]  Out of hand, they lie to us on every front.
[02:43:06.041 --> 02:43:08.163]  Yeah, they're like, oh, it only works inside of the school.
[02:43:08.163 --> 02:43:13.407]  You know, we can only track you inside the school, but then they go put trackers on your buses and then this never turns off.
[02:43:13.407 --> 02:43:15.148]  Just like the laptops.
[02:43:15.148 --> 02:43:18.191]  Just like the laptops in Pennsylvania where they watch the kids at home.
[02:43:18.191 --> 02:43:18.971]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:18.971 --> 02:43:19.372]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:19.372 --> 02:43:20.733]  We heard about that one, too.
[02:43:20.733 --> 02:43:21.954]  What's incredible is, is that
[02:43:22.894 --> 02:43:24.775]  Tell folks what you've done.
[02:43:24.775 --> 02:43:26.617]  I mean, this has become a big national story.
[02:43:26.617 --> 02:43:30.039]  Now the majority of parents I see in the headlines, they don't like it either.
[02:43:30.039 --> 02:43:32.380]  But they're just trying to stonewall and say, we're doing this.
[02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:38.044]  Well, you know, we started out with one newscast on KSAT 12 in San Antonio.
[02:43:38.044 --> 02:43:40.165]  And all of a sudden, it just blew up.
[02:43:40.165 --> 02:43:43.828]  The gentleman that came here today that's out there in the waiting room, his name is Bobby Scott.
[02:43:43.828 --> 02:43:49.912]  And I have to give all respect to him because if it wasn't for Bobby Scott, I wouldn't be sitting here today with you.
[02:43:50.788 --> 02:43:52.391]  You know what, I just had an epiphany.
[02:43:52.391 --> 02:43:54.915]  I've already got two interviews lined up tonight for the nightly news.
[02:43:54.915 --> 02:43:55.957]  This is so important.
[02:43:57.369 --> 02:44:11.999]  Can you guys, right when the show ends in a few minutes, in about 15 minutes, can I have Aaron Dykes, because I've got two meetings I've got to do ahead of the interviews, could you go in and do like a 30-40 minute interview where you can just cover all of it, show your documents so there's a huge record of this, of what you're doing?
[02:44:11.999 --> 02:44:13.100]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:17.683]  Because I want to respect the fact that you've come here and that I've got such a busy day, I kind of just crammed you in here.
[02:44:17.683 --> 02:44:22.006]  I apologize for not being more prepared because this is so important, sir.
[02:44:23.687 --> 02:44:25.589]  I mean, I just want to say I admire you.
[02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:26.029]  Thank you.
[02:44:26.029 --> 02:44:29.012]  You're the type of person that's going to save this country and turn things around.
[02:44:29.012 --> 02:44:29.752]  Thank you.
[02:44:29.752 --> 02:44:31.494]  I mean, you're my hero.
[02:44:31.494 --> 02:44:32.054]  I mean that.
[02:44:32.054 --> 02:44:32.955]  You're my hero.
[02:44:32.955 --> 02:44:33.155]  Thank you.
[02:44:33.155 --> 02:44:37.899]  People like you, your son who's got the courage to be here, your daughter, your wife who couldn't be here today.
[02:44:37.899 --> 02:44:38.860]  I mean, because she's got to work.
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:40.081]  You guys are incredible.
[02:44:40.081 --> 02:44:40.881]  You're normal.
[02:44:40.881 --> 02:44:44.204]  This is what a normal person does when they try to give you slave badges.
[02:44:44.204 --> 02:44:44.865]  And let me tell you what.
[02:44:47.099 --> 02:44:50.560]  If it wasn't for Bob Scott, I wouldn't be here, because he called me six times at work.
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:51.540]  Well, we'll interview him in there.
[02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:52.180]  Tell us about him.
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:52.800]  That's why he's here.
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:54.180]  We'll get him on the TV.
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:58.141]  This guy listens to talk radio, and he's talking about you.
[02:44:58.141 --> 02:45:01.042]  You need to call this lady Katie somebody.
[02:45:01.042 --> 02:45:02.622]  And it was on the Joe Pag Show.
[02:45:02.622 --> 02:45:04.223]  So I googled it real quick.
[02:45:04.223 --> 02:45:05.703]  Oops, I'm not supposed to say googled.
[02:45:05.703 --> 02:45:09.484]  I searched it real quick, and I sent Katie an email.
[02:45:09.484 --> 02:45:13.804]  And the next day, Katie called me, and it's blowing up since then.
[02:45:13.804 --> 02:45:16.125]  We've had protests in front of Anson Jones Middle School.
[02:45:17.652 --> 02:45:20.214]  We didn't get favorable coverage.
[02:45:20.214 --> 02:45:27.138]  That's because you're standing up for those children who are being abused and inducted into a prison state, and the media wants to keep this going.
[02:45:27.138 --> 02:45:28.819]  They're collaborating.
[02:45:28.819 --> 02:45:33.742]  We didn't get favorable coverage at all except for the first two on WAI, Channel 4, and KSAT 12.
[02:45:33.742 --> 02:45:36.423]  The first two interviews were favorable.
[02:45:36.423 --> 02:45:41.206]  Because they know this could set a precedent nationwide, like Rosa Parks saying, I won't sit at the back of the bus.
[02:45:41.206 --> 02:45:43.027]  They need to bring this slave grid in.
[02:45:43.027 --> 02:45:44.188]  There's billions behind this.
[02:45:44.528 --> 02:45:45.449]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:45:45.449 --> 02:45:50.912]  I think yesterday when we were doing the math, it came out to almost $40 million for 112 schools.
[02:45:50.912 --> 02:45:55.355]  If it's $525,000 for just two schools... And they want to put it in all San Antonio schools.
[02:45:55.355 --> 02:45:57.316]  110 schools more.
[02:45:57.316 --> 02:46:00.198]  And you're the beta test because that's where the whole military is.
[02:46:00.198 --> 02:46:00.618]  Absolutely.
[02:46:00.618 --> 02:46:01.578]  And they're rolling it out.
[02:46:01.578 --> 02:46:05.821]  And they want these kids to start learning from kinder all the way up until they graduate.
[02:46:07.057 --> 02:46:08.558]  No, I'm not going to have that.
[02:46:08.558 --> 02:46:10.219]  I would rather homeschool my children first.
[02:46:10.219 --> 02:46:16.263]  In fact, I'd rather be here with you today talking about this and help educating people to get this word out.
[02:46:16.263 --> 02:46:17.584]  This is ridiculous.
[02:46:17.584 --> 02:46:19.005]  Son, I mean, what's your take on this?
[02:46:19.005 --> 02:46:20.486]  Why are you here with your dad?
[02:46:20.486 --> 02:46:21.887]  I'm here to support him.
[02:46:21.887 --> 02:46:26.290]  I don't think that my sister or I should ever have to wear this badge.
[02:46:26.290 --> 02:46:28.511]  I mean, it's pointless.
[02:46:28.511 --> 02:46:35.936]  And all the money that they're putting to the badges, it could be used for other things like athletics, teachers and stuff.
[02:46:35.936 --> 02:46:36.497]  Tutoring.
[02:46:37.258 --> 02:46:37.720]  Yeah.
[02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:41.918]  But instead, it's being used to teach you the most important thing, that you're a prisoner.
[02:46:43.254 --> 02:46:45.075]  And that Big Brother is going to watch everything you do.
[02:46:45.075 --> 02:46:46.476]  This is like a science fiction movie.
[02:46:46.476 --> 02:46:47.116]  Yeah, it is.
[02:46:47.116 --> 02:46:48.937]  And by the way, you said it's leading to the beast.
[02:46:48.937 --> 02:46:56.321]  I agree, but it's pretty much kind of that link, that final link, because you got a thumbprint face scan in most schools now to get your lunch.
[02:46:56.321 --> 02:46:58.042]  That's already digitally connected.
[02:46:58.042 --> 02:47:00.244]  That's already tracking you to get library books.
[02:47:00.244 --> 02:47:03.625]  This is going in tanning salons, bookstores.
[02:47:03.625 --> 02:47:06.887]  They've got Facebook now trying to make you use this to buy and sell.
[02:47:06.887 --> 02:47:07.348]  It's here.
[02:47:07.348 --> 02:47:07.988]  We're in trouble.
[02:47:08.588 --> 02:47:10.670]  It turns out Facebook is CIA.
[02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:12.671]  Google's NSA.
[02:47:12.671 --> 02:47:13.551]  Everything's coming out.
[02:47:13.551 --> 02:47:15.612]  They built this whole fake grid for us.
[02:47:15.612 --> 02:47:16.293]  Absolutely.
[02:47:16.293 --> 02:47:17.394]  I agree with 100%.
[02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:22.577]  The things that we've been finding out ever since Katie and Catherine and Liz McIntyre have been talking with us...
[02:47:23.377 --> 02:47:24.538]  I mean, we are changed.
[02:47:24.538 --> 02:47:25.919]  San Antonio enlightened me.
[02:47:25.919 --> 02:47:27.540]  We have changed Texas Hill Country.
[02:47:27.540 --> 02:47:31.343]  All these folks come to my house, visit with me, call me on the phone.
[02:47:31.343 --> 02:47:33.604]  I mean, my email is just blown up.
[02:47:33.604 --> 02:47:42.530]  For those that don't know, We Are Change is a group that came out of a fellow, Luke Rudowsky, I supported, that's grassroots, another, basically, info warrior group of people that just aren't left or right.
[02:47:42.530 --> 02:47:44.131]  They stand for basic freedom.
[02:47:44.131 --> 02:47:44.552]  Absolutely.
[02:47:44.552 --> 02:47:50.376]  Like, hey, our kids shouldn't wear tracker chips that even follow them outside school, and the Department of Defense shouldn't have $500,000 AI computers watching the kids.
[02:47:52.617 --> 02:47:57.881]  You know, and we went to NISD, and we were given Citizens to Speak Hour.
[02:47:57.881 --> 02:48:01.584]  Okay, so Citizens to Be Heard Hour came up, and we went up there.
[02:48:01.584 --> 02:48:05.586]  I was the first one, then Andrea, and then the rest of the folks who were there.
[02:48:05.586 --> 02:48:12.411]  And the lady by the name of Karen Freeman, we call her the president because she was kind of running the whole show.
[02:48:12.411 --> 02:48:16.915]  She said, you know, we're going to give you this time to speak, but we don't have to act on this.
[02:48:17.628 --> 02:48:19.469]  Oh, they always want you to know you don't have power.
[02:48:19.469 --> 02:48:23.590]  I've had the mayor and people when I was fighting the Patriot Act walk off stage.
[02:48:23.590 --> 02:48:26.751]  And they want you to know, you got your time to speak, but we're not listening.
[02:48:26.751 --> 02:48:28.631]  You don't have power, little man.
[02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:29.451]  We couldn't clap.
[02:48:29.451 --> 02:48:30.052]  We couldn't cheer.
[02:48:30.052 --> 02:48:30.752]  We couldn't do nothing.
[02:48:30.752 --> 02:48:35.053]  They told Matthew Medina, if you clap one more time, you're out of here.
[02:48:35.053 --> 02:48:36.433]  We'll have you escorted.
[02:48:36.433 --> 02:48:37.694]  And that's fine.
[02:48:37.694 --> 02:48:38.294]  We don't mind.
[02:48:38.294 --> 02:48:42.175]  Matthew actually got a ticket for using a bullhorn to help protest.
[02:48:42.881 --> 02:48:45.923]  Because the police said he broke the barrier to sound.
[02:48:45.923 --> 02:48:47.144]  Which, by the way, it didn't.
[02:48:47.144 --> 02:48:48.846]  Because I've seen your... That's it!
[02:48:48.846 --> 02:48:49.987]  They're getting scared!
[02:48:49.987 --> 02:48:52.308]  Oh no, they're not going to let us turn them into prisoners!
[02:48:52.308 --> 02:48:53.710]  You know, this is our food!
[02:48:53.710 --> 02:48:54.370]  We're the government!
[02:48:54.370 --> 02:48:55.731]  These are our cows!
[02:48:55.731 --> 02:48:56.512]  No cows!
[02:48:56.512 --> 02:48:57.693]  You're our food!
[02:48:57.693 --> 02:48:59.134]  You're our slave!
[02:48:59.134 --> 02:49:09.362]  You know, the NIH Police Department, we were listening to them talk when we were outside Anson Jones, and they're actually telling the parents, oh, this is a great, great idea, because if there was a fire, we could track your children.
[02:49:10.052 --> 02:49:16.295]  I'm kind of thinking to myself, okay, if you're going to track my children, who's going to track the poor guy who's tracking the children in the room?
[02:49:16.295 --> 02:49:17.836]  Who's going to save him?
[02:49:17.836 --> 02:49:21.117]  Well, look, the whole point is they never use exactly the cameras or any of this.
[02:49:21.117 --> 02:49:22.418]  It's all about control.
[02:49:22.418 --> 02:49:24.058]  It's all about money and control.
[02:49:24.058 --> 02:49:25.419]  That's all it is.
[02:49:25.419 --> 02:49:27.400]  I went to John Jay High School 25 years ago.
[02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:29.401]  There's no difference now.
[02:49:29.401 --> 02:49:30.842]  I hear a lot of people.
[02:49:30.842 --> 02:49:31.762]  I've been chastised.
[02:49:31.762 --> 02:49:32.642]  I've been yelled at.
[02:49:32.642 --> 02:49:35.384]  I've had arguments with people.
[02:49:35.384 --> 02:49:35.824]  But you know what?
[02:49:36.454 --> 02:49:39.235]  They keep telling me, Steve, keep your mouth shut.
[02:49:39.235 --> 02:49:42.437]  Just tell your daughter to put your badge on and go to school and learn something.
[02:49:42.437 --> 02:49:43.478]  And do the next thing.
[02:49:43.478 --> 02:49:46.419]  Now they're starting forced inoculation outside of law.
[02:49:46.419 --> 02:49:47.240]  It's a felony.
[02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:54.563]  They're injecting nationwide and injecting your children and lying and saying it's the law when it's a policy, not a law.
[02:49:54.563 --> 02:49:57.925]  And again, a government that'll do this, I wouldn't trust them with a vaccine.
[02:49:57.925 --> 02:49:58.785]  There's a whole history of that.
[02:49:58.785 --> 02:50:00.466]  But you know the clip from Bug's Life.
[02:50:00.466 --> 02:50:03.668]  If you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[02:50:03.988 --> 02:50:08.769]  That's why they're telling you, who is a hero for just being normal, you're bad.
[02:50:08.769 --> 02:50:09.329]  You're bad.
[02:50:09.329 --> 02:50:11.390]  Steve Hernandez, he's bad.
[02:50:11.390 --> 02:50:13.611]  His daughter, Andre Hernandez, you're bad.
[02:50:13.611 --> 02:50:17.192]  Your son, you're bad because you don't want to be a prisoner.
[02:50:17.192 --> 02:50:22.493]  And you know, let me tell you what, there are teachers who don't want to speak up, and they're Christians because they're afraid to lose their jobs.
[02:50:22.493 --> 02:50:25.614]  I have a friend of mine... Well, there you are, and they'll take the mark of the beast then if they're scared now.
[02:50:25.614 --> 02:50:28.555]  Folks, if you're not taking action now, when will you?
[02:50:28.555 --> 02:50:29.075]  Absolutely.
[02:50:29.075 --> 02:50:32.076]  Well, they tell them that's why you're going to be raptured, so you don't have to worry about it.
[02:50:32.076 --> 02:50:33.096]  That's all been preplanned.
[02:50:33.516 --> 02:50:33.916]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.916 --> 02:50:34.376]  Doesn't matter.
[02:50:34.376 --> 02:50:37.037]  God will say He doesn't know you if you don't stand up against this.
[02:50:37.037 --> 02:50:37.857]  Absolutely.
[02:50:37.857 --> 02:50:40.058]  What you do to the least of me, you've done to me.
[02:50:40.058 --> 02:50:42.299]  All these enforcers need to know that.
[02:50:42.299 --> 02:50:45.700]  Hurting children and innocent people.
[02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:48.321]  Better to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the ocean.
[02:50:48.321 --> 02:50:48.761]  Absolutely.
[02:50:48.761 --> 02:50:49.781]  You'll call that a terror threat.
[02:50:49.781 --> 02:50:51.142]  No, you don't have to worry about me.
[02:50:51.142 --> 02:50:53.303]  God is going to cut you down.
[02:50:53.303 --> 02:50:55.443]  If you don't repent right now, we'll be right back.
[02:50:55.443 --> 02:50:58.364]  Sooner or later, He's going to cut you down.
[02:50:58.364 --> 02:50:59.525]  Eisenhower quote on screen.
[02:50:59.525 --> 02:51:00.245]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:06.601]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:51:06.601 --> 02:51:09.642]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:51:09.642 --> 02:51:18.605]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:51:18.605 --> 02:51:23.506]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:51:24.145 --> 02:51:35.517]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[02:52:01.875 --> 02:52:06.437]  What do you do when your propane runs out and you don't have a large amount of wood for cooking?
[02:52:06.437 --> 02:52:10.118]  That's when you need a Grover Rocket Stove from StockStorage.com.

[02:52:44.388 --> 02:52:44.688]  That's 801-361-6984.
[02:52:51.749 --> 02:52:52.210]  I think so.
[02:53:01.394 --> 02:53:02.395]  Hi there.
[02:53:02.395 --> 02:53:03.916]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:53:03.916 --> 02:53:07.759]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:53:07.759 --> 02:53:16.906]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[02:53:16.906 --> 02:53:23.631]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:53:23.631 --> 02:53:25.813]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[02:53:25.813 --> 02:53:30.897]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:53:31.617 --> 02:53:39.543]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[02:53:39.543 --> 02:53:45.127]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[02:53:45.127 --> 02:53:51.631]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[02:53:51.631 --> 02:53:57.355]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:53:57.355 --> 02:53:58.616]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:54:12.383 --> 02:54:20.487]  Dwight D. Eisenhower, speaking to a major university, you can look it up, it's a vetted quote, said, if you want total security, go to prison.
[02:54:20.487 --> 02:54:23.969]  There you're fed, clothed, and given medical care, and so on.
[02:54:23.969 --> 02:54:26.570]  The only thing lacking is freedom.
[02:54:26.570 --> 02:54:28.851]  And, you know, that's the fact here.
[02:54:28.851 --> 02:54:36.775]  The NSA has been caught spying on everyone, political people, they're now arresting peaceful protesters, saying it's terrorism to protest, that's mainstream news.
[02:54:36.775 --> 02:54:37.936]  The hour is late.
[02:54:38.885 --> 02:54:40.647]  This is Department of Defense run.
[02:54:40.647 --> 02:54:44.109]  I'm not against our military, but our government's been taken over.
[02:54:44.109 --> 02:54:49.054]  It's been taken over by globalists who say they've conquered this nation, foreign banks.
[02:54:49.054 --> 02:54:54.138]  And it was about 12 years ago, WorldNetDaily reported on it.
[02:54:54.138 --> 02:54:55.359]  You can look this up.
[02:54:55.359 --> 02:54:59.983]  In Louisiana, they tried to make them wear these RFID badges, and satellite trackers are now coming out.
[02:55:03.066 --> 02:55:09.874]  Tried to expel people, but then others joined the children, like a prison break, a protest, and they had to remove them.
[02:55:09.874 --> 02:55:14.920]  So they're scared because they've tried to do this over and over again, and they're acting like you're weird, they're acting like you're crazy.
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:16.682]  They've been trying this for 20 years.
[02:55:16.682 --> 02:55:18.324]  So remember that, Mr. Hernandez.
[02:55:18.324 --> 02:55:19.625]  They've got psyops people.
[02:55:19.625 --> 02:55:21.768]  This is multi-billions nationwide to get this in.
[02:55:22.528 --> 02:55:25.450]  Absolutely.
[02:55:25.450 --> 02:55:26.631]  They are scared of you.
[02:55:26.631 --> 02:55:27.552]  They know you're in the right.
[02:55:27.552 --> 02:55:30.014]  And they want to make you think you're bad.
[02:55:30.014 --> 02:55:31.535]  What response have you gotten from family?
[02:55:31.535 --> 02:55:32.996]  You were talking to me during the break.
[02:55:32.996 --> 02:55:35.798]  You know, I've hardly any response from family.
[02:55:35.798 --> 02:55:41.442]  I get more support from strangers and people at work than I do from families.
[02:55:41.442 --> 02:55:43.003]  I've asked people to support me.
[02:55:43.003 --> 02:55:46.445]  Go on to the Girls Facebook site and put something positive.
[02:55:46.445 --> 02:55:47.486]  Help us out.
[02:55:47.486 --> 02:55:48.487]  Because they're all Christians.
[02:55:50.603 --> 02:55:55.446]  I have a lot of Christian friends and family who think it's fine.
[02:55:55.446 --> 02:55:58.888]  They think it's absolutely fine what they're doing.
[02:55:58.888 --> 02:56:01.190]  And unfortunately... Well, you were saying even more during the break.
[02:56:01.190 --> 02:56:05.112]  Some people are telling you and the family... I mean, tell us.
[02:56:05.112 --> 02:56:06.853]  I don't get like any response from my family.
[02:56:06.853 --> 02:56:07.494]  I'm getting like...
[02:56:08.413 --> 02:56:12.854]  People that are supposed to be friends that are turning their backs on me saying, just wear it, it's just a badge.
[02:56:12.854 --> 02:56:16.175]  And I was like, no, this is a lot bigger than just a badge.
[02:56:16.175 --> 02:56:17.896]  It's not just a badge.
[02:56:17.896 --> 02:56:19.216]  A badge is this.
[02:56:19.216 --> 02:56:20.636]  This is a badge.
[02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:21.437]  This is a chip.
[02:56:21.437 --> 02:56:22.557]  That's a tracker.
[02:56:22.557 --> 02:56:23.017]  Exactly.
[02:56:23.017 --> 02:56:24.557]  A barcode's one thing.
[02:56:24.557 --> 02:56:27.138]  And we always said it'll lead to chips next with the barcodes.
[02:56:27.138 --> 02:56:29.299]  It was Louisiana that said no to the barcodes, actually.
[02:56:29.299 --> 02:56:32.039]  Because people can read those, by the way, and then get your personal data.
[02:56:32.039 --> 02:56:34.900]  You can, with the eye, read a barcode once you learn the spaces.
[02:56:34.900 --> 02:56:37.721]  Son, you were wanting to show people the signs you've got for protesting.
[02:56:39.125 --> 02:56:42.168]  One of you was telling me during the break, though, about family saying, hey, quit it, quit it.
[02:56:42.168 --> 02:56:43.429]  Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:44.751]  There you go.
[02:56:44.751 --> 02:56:45.592]  I am not a number.
[02:56:46.738 --> 02:56:53.081]  And then you've got the other one, Tracking No, and that's Catherine Albrecht, right here on the Genesis Network, who helped you out with those.
[02:56:53.081 --> 02:56:54.101]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[02:56:54.101 --> 02:56:54.941]  Where do you go from here?
[02:56:54.941 --> 02:56:58.543]  Because you've got all these other documents and articles you'll be able to cover on the nightly news.
[02:56:58.543 --> 02:57:01.524]  You know, just to hit real quick on what you're saying about family.
[02:57:01.524 --> 02:57:05.126]  I had a family member texting me yesterday, and he says, you know, you're always into something.
[02:57:05.126 --> 02:57:06.886]  Why can't you just leave stuff alone?
[02:57:06.886 --> 02:57:09.747]  Just tell your daughter, put the badge on, go to school, and learn something.
[02:57:09.747 --> 02:57:11.808]  Well, let me ask you something.
[02:57:11.808 --> 02:57:14.950]  I'm sure he's going to not like this, but I'm going to tell you anyways.
[02:57:14.950 --> 02:57:15.670]  I was a tracking ship.
[02:57:16.090 --> 02:57:16.971]  It's going to make her learn.
[02:57:16.971 --> 02:57:18.992]  It's not going to help her with her education.
[02:57:18.992 --> 02:57:21.214]  It's going to make her learn to wear a prisoner badge.
[02:57:21.214 --> 02:57:21.594]  Exactly.
[02:57:21.594 --> 02:57:22.535]  It's going to condition her.
[02:57:22.535 --> 02:57:24.636]  Make her learn to be conditioned and think everything is okay.
[02:57:24.636 --> 02:57:25.477]  It's not the norm.
[02:57:25.477 --> 02:57:29.279]  They now put people through body scanners at Sony factories and stuff.
[02:57:29.279 --> 02:57:32.561]  I mean, we're being inducted into a prison culture.
[02:57:32.561 --> 02:57:35.303]  And it's so incredible.
[02:57:35.303 --> 02:57:37.085]  Tell us about your Facebooks and things.
[02:57:37.085 --> 02:57:37.845]  How people can help you.
[02:57:37.845 --> 02:57:38.966]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:57:38.966 --> 02:57:40.447]  The girls set up a Facebook.
[02:57:40.447 --> 02:57:43.229]  It's called Students Against RFID Tracking.
[02:57:44.049 --> 02:57:45.890]  And my Facebook is linked to theirs.
[02:57:45.890 --> 02:57:49.331]  So whatever I post online, I post on theirs.
[02:57:49.331 --> 02:57:54.954]  You know, for those who support us, you know, go in there and put your comments, your opinions, send pictures.
[02:57:54.954 --> 02:57:57.535]  We're going to tweet your Facebook right now.
[02:57:57.535 --> 02:58:00.957]  You guys asked me to tweet for me because I got my hands full.
[02:58:00.957 --> 02:58:06.279]  Tweet that out that everybody needs to stand with you because they don't want you to have solidarity, aid and comfort.
[02:58:06.279 --> 02:58:08.740]  They don't want American patriots to have aid and comfort.
[02:58:08.740 --> 02:58:10.841]  They want to make you feel like you're alone and demoralized.
[02:58:11.201 --> 02:58:20.204]  And you know, and we're telling everybody, look, if you want to learn more about this, go to spychips.com, because they're posting everything that we're doing in San Antonio on their website to help us.
[02:58:20.204 --> 02:58:25.685]  You know, let me tell you what, these ladies have just been overwhelmingly supportive, and they're great people.
[02:58:25.685 --> 02:58:26.766]  Well, they're looking for a hero.
[02:58:26.766 --> 02:58:30.427]  I mean, they understand you're there in the fight, everybody nationwide.
[02:58:30.427 --> 02:58:31.687]  This is happening everywhere, by the way.
[02:58:31.687 --> 02:58:32.047]  Yes, sir, yes, sir.
[02:58:32.047 --> 02:58:35.408]  You're just one of the few people that's got half a brain to realize the evil.
[02:58:35.408 --> 02:58:36.549]  And sir, I salute you.
[02:58:36.549 --> 02:58:39.950]  We'll have more on the nightly news on this and more 7 o'clock tonight.
