[00:00.000 --> 00:28.080]  It's Friday, August 27th, the year is 2021.
[00:28.080 --> 00:35.880]  And the Surgeon General of the United States has gone on TV four times in the last week
[00:35.880 --> 00:42.240]  that I've personally seen and said natural immunity is not good and will not protect
[00:42.240 --> 00:46.480]  you from COVID-19 if you've already had it.
[00:46.480 --> 00:53.280]  Despite the fact that we have a new Israeli study out, this ends the debate.
[00:53.280 --> 00:59.200]  Israeli study shows natural immunity 13 times more effective than so-called vaccines and
[00:59.200 --> 01:06.120]  stopping Delta, which is supposedly the most virulent variant.
[01:06.120 --> 01:07.440]  But we already know that.
[01:07.440 --> 01:15.920]  So what does it mean to have the Surgeon General in his little admiral outfit up there lying
[01:15.920 --> 01:17.800]  to us like this?
[01:17.800 --> 01:20.120]  What does that signify?
[01:20.120 --> 01:23.280]  It signifies that he's at war with us and at war with the truth.
[01:23.280 --> 01:28.120]  And if you try to disagree with him, big tech that spies on you and surveils you will come
[01:28.120 --> 01:30.880]  in and censor you.
[01:30.880 --> 01:31.880]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:31.880 --> 01:37.920]  In fact, everybody knows natural immunity is better than normal inoculation immunity.
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.920]  But normal inoculation technology works.
[01:39.920 --> 01:41.440]  It's got side effects.
[01:41.440 --> 01:42.600]  It's got problems.
[01:42.600 --> 01:43.600]  It can be contaminated.
[01:43.600 --> 01:45.720]  They've got liability protection.
[01:45.720 --> 01:49.600]  There's been a lot of major damages throughout history in the last 100 years.
[01:49.600 --> 01:53.160]  There's been a lot of secret experimentation through vaccines, including lethal testing
[01:53.160 --> 01:59.160]  of syphilis on poor people.
[01:59.160 --> 02:00.520]  So why do they do that?
[02:00.520 --> 02:02.600]  Because they're at war with us.
[02:02.600 --> 02:10.880]  Now, when planets align, this is what happens.
[02:10.880 --> 02:15.880]  I was studying last night after the family went to bed and going back and looking at
[02:15.880 --> 02:21.840]  old patents, because Bill Gates and Fauci did massive animal testing on these current
[02:21.840 --> 02:24.960]  vaccines that aren't vaccines.
[02:24.960 --> 02:28.160]  That's why they didn't want public animal testing when they tried to get approval because
[02:28.160 --> 02:34.360]  they'd already secretly done the testing under other names to make sure it was a deadly bio
[02:34.360 --> 02:38.760]  weapon, the vaccine, the so-called vaccine, the injection.
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.280]  And so I came in here this morning ready to cover this topic, and it was in my stack
[02:44.280 --> 02:46.920]  already.
[02:46.920 --> 02:47.920]  And I thought, this is strange.
[02:47.920 --> 02:53.720]  I didn't send this to the producers, these patents and documents and articles.
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.840]  And then about 30 minutes ago, I'm walking down the hall, getting myself a glass of orange
[02:58.840 --> 03:07.240]  lacroix, and Harrison Smith's on the wall live, and we got TVs on all the place, talking
[03:07.240 --> 03:10.520]  about what I was about to cover, and I said, hey, I'm about to cover that.
[03:10.520 --> 03:11.520]  Well, what?
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.000]  Why is he covering it?
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.840]  And they said, no, it's Harrison put that in your stack today.
[03:16.840 --> 03:18.760]  So this is meant to be covered.
[03:18.760 --> 03:21.200]  He'll be with us at the bottom of the hour.
[03:21.200 --> 03:23.160]  He just finished doing American Journal.
[03:23.160 --> 03:24.600]  He'll be in studio with us.
[03:24.600 --> 03:28.920]  And what am I talking about?
[03:28.920 --> 03:31.480]  And again, I'm a guy that can handle myself.
[03:31.480 --> 03:36.920]  I'm a pretty smooth operator when it comes to being calm under pressure.
[03:36.920 --> 03:45.680]  But last night, at about midnight, I literally had an anxiety attack and was just out under
[03:45.680 --> 03:51.200]  the stars in the backyard crying, not sobbing, just crying, saying, God, what do I do to protect
[03:51.200 --> 03:52.200]  my family?
[03:52.200 --> 03:55.080]  My God, because we have the plan here.
[03:55.080 --> 03:57.560]  What they did with the chickens is what they're doing to us.
[03:57.560 --> 04:03.720]  They knew when they gave chickens a cold virus vaccine that it created superviruses that
[04:03.720 --> 04:06.480]  killed 100% of the chickens.
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.600]  And then that's what they're doing.
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.160]  And by the time they take the third round with the booster, that's what happened with the
[04:11.160 --> 04:12.160]  chickens.
[04:12.160 --> 04:15.720]  It creates variants that kill 95% of the chickens.
[04:15.720 --> 04:16.720]  They kept giving them shots.
[04:16.720 --> 04:19.200]  So it got up to 100% of the chickens.
[04:19.200 --> 04:20.880]  You give people four or five boosters.
[04:20.880 --> 04:23.280]  It's 100% death rate.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.640]  And what's crazy is we're going to watch everybody take the shots.
[04:26.640 --> 04:27.840]  We're going to watch everybody die.
[04:27.840 --> 04:32.160]  I mean, this is even PBS reporting this.
[04:32.160 --> 04:37.120]  So just at this point, we're going under judgment.
[04:37.120 --> 04:41.200]  And if we let them do this to us, we deserve it.
[04:41.200 --> 04:42.960]  But our children don't, though.
[04:42.960 --> 04:46.080]  They didn't ask for this, and they haven't come of age yet, and they haven't committed
[04:46.080 --> 04:47.880]  all the sins we've committed.
[04:47.880 --> 04:49.320]  And so we have to protect our children.
[04:49.320 --> 04:50.760]  But that's coming up.
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.160]  And then there's even just as big a news that just freaks me completely out.
[04:55.160 --> 05:00.360]  And that's the suppression of ivermectin that's now 100% confirmed to be a miracle drug.
[05:00.360 --> 05:03.600]  And these insane times, I wouldn't mess around.
[05:03.600 --> 05:06.680]  I wouldn't screw around with your health and your immune system.
[05:06.680 --> 05:12.520]  I would do everything you can to boost your body's natural defenses, and at the same time,
[05:12.520 --> 05:16.960]  support those that are fighting the globalist and fighting to stop new lockdowns and tyranny.

[06:23.720 --> 06:28.800]  All right, we have a lot of really incredible news out of Afghanistan.
[06:28.800 --> 06:32.720]  A lot of unbelievable economic news here domestically.
[06:32.720 --> 06:37.000]  We have a lot of social news with General Milley teaming up with the left to promote
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.520]  transgenderism in the military.
[06:39.520 --> 06:45.160]  We have Ashley Babbitt's killer bragging about how he's a hero on TV and how he saved countless
[06:45.160 --> 06:49.360]  lives shooting a five foot two unarmed woman.
[06:49.360 --> 06:54.360]  And Ashley Babbitt's widower, did a great job last night on Tucker Carlson, will be
[06:54.360 --> 07:01.120]  joining us from work today for about 10 minutes at the start of the next hour to respond to
[07:01.120 --> 07:07.960]  this rubbing it in our faces, the execution of his wife.
[07:07.960 --> 07:14.200]  But before we do all of that, let me just tell you something.
[07:14.200 --> 07:20.600]  The people running things are depopulating us on purpose and there's no doubt about that.
[07:20.600 --> 07:31.280]  And even more evidence has come into focus now on three massive fronts.
[07:31.280 --> 07:41.800]  And one of those is a huge area of science dealing with the fact that they gave anti-cold
[07:41.800 --> 07:52.600]  virus, anti-coronavirus, anti bird flu virus vaccines the last 20 years to poultry farms
[07:52.600 --> 08:01.560]  around the world, and it created a super virus that kills 100% of the birds.
[08:01.560 --> 08:08.560]  But first it grows metastasized cancers throughout all its lymph nodes.
[08:08.560 --> 08:20.440]  And by the third round of shots, 95% of the chickens are killed by the super virus that
[08:20.440 --> 08:25.000]  these so-called vaccines give rights to.
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.240]  And it turns out Bill Gates specifically tested all this and knew all this and that's
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.120]  why he got animal trials skipped because they had already done animal trials under other
[08:33.120 --> 08:37.560]  names with basically the exact same injections.
[08:37.560 --> 08:42.240]  And we covered this a year and a half ago off all the patents on poultry for geese and
[08:42.240 --> 08:45.080]  turkeys and chickens and the rest of it.
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.000]  But it turns out it's all hiding in plain view and now they're saying, oh, we've got
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.360]  to have a vaccine to counter the spike protein of the vaccine.
[08:55.360 --> 09:03.120]  But once you take that, you're colonized by the final vaccine that's not a vaccine and
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.000]  have to keep taking it for life or the tumors consume your body.
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.440]  Now I want you to understand something.
[09:09.440 --> 09:13.000]  I'm not just saying that overhead shot, please.
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.680]  I've got a stack of articles here from 2015, this is a big scandal.
[09:18.680 --> 09:25.280]  This chicken vaccine makes its virus more dangerous, PBS.
[09:25.280 --> 09:28.200]  Marics, disease, and chickens causes symptoms and prevention.
[09:28.200 --> 09:32.240]  They admit it's caused by a vaccine.
[09:32.240 --> 09:39.600]  Marics, disease, and chickens, leaky vaccines, enhanced spread of deadly or chicken viruses,
[09:39.600 --> 09:47.760]  national geographic and I got a boil down synopsis and I got studies on the diseases.
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.480]  Marics disease right here, the big journal of biology, US government reports all right
[09:54.480 --> 09:55.480]  there.
[09:55.480 --> 10:04.280]  It's up bottom of the hour with Harrison Smith, who's doing a great job breaking it down.
[10:04.280 --> 10:09.440]  But this is only one facet of what they're doing.
[10:09.440 --> 10:11.640]  Now it gets worse.
[10:11.640 --> 10:13.600]  This all ties together.
[10:13.600 --> 10:20.800]  Researchers ready lab-grown COVID-19 Delta variant for human trials, we're going to tie
[10:20.800 --> 10:21.800]  that together.
[10:21.800 --> 10:27.520]  This is the exact same path they followed with the chickens.
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.880]  And by the fourth or fifth round of injections, the body is completely taken over and colonized
[10:34.880 --> 10:40.280]  by the virus and the body becomes a collection of tumors.
[10:40.280 --> 10:43.400]  But then they have another vaccine that they give the chicken that makes them basically
[10:43.400 --> 10:45.160]  an undead chicken.
[10:45.160 --> 10:49.880]  They're heartbeats and things, but they are now a colonized creature when they give this
[10:49.880 --> 10:55.160]  final fifth or sixth shot, depending on how they do it, depending on the variants, the
[10:55.160 --> 10:58.040]  chicken now becomes a living tumor.
[10:58.040 --> 11:02.680]  Now the Japanese just found what we already knew.
[11:02.680 --> 11:11.760]  The mRNA vaccines are loaded with liquid metal, liquid magnets.
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.880]  The Japanese have probably the best medicine in the world, if not the second or third best.
[11:16.880 --> 11:23.160]  They're smart people, they have high IQs, and they have very good medicine, and they
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.640]  are not as easy to buy off as we are when it comes to things like that.
[11:27.640 --> 11:30.120]  They'll follow orders corporately and stuff, but when it comes to medicine, they're not
[11:30.120 --> 11:31.920]  known to follow orders.
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.000]  And their top scientists have come out the head of their main medical board in Tokyo
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.440]  and said that, A, we gave ibermectin to everybody 100% cure rates, it stops the prion from dividing,
[11:44.440 --> 11:51.400]  and they said we tested, of course they don't trust now, the electron microscope, the Merck
[11:51.400 --> 11:58.520]  shots, and they found that it is basically liquid, some type of liquid metal that's magnetized.
[11:58.520 --> 12:03.120]  This is not a mistake, this is war, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:03.120 --> 12:08.080]  Now remember if you turn on the nightly news or the late night comics or the young Turks
[12:08.080 --> 12:15.520]  are like, these idiots are taking horse medicine, well yeah, horses take ibermectin, I worked
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.120]  for a large animal vet several years back in high school, and sometimes you'd go out
[12:20.120 --> 12:23.520]  there and take care of the horses, they'd pay it out, de-warm them, and you'd just jam
[12:23.520 --> 12:29.920]  the plastic, syringe the corner of their mouth, it wasn't a needle, it was just like a, same
[12:29.920 --> 12:33.880]  thing you'd put putty in the corners of windows with, but it was ibermectin, you'd score it
[12:33.880 --> 12:38.000]  in its mouth, and then the horse would get rid of any worms or parasites to that.
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.360]  But ibermectin for humans has a bunch of uses as well, but they found very early on that
[12:43.360 --> 12:49.320]  it's been good for antiviral stuff as well, and in Africa the Japanese found that every
[12:49.320 --> 12:57.480]  African country that hands out ibermectin twice a year and tells people to take it has
[12:57.480 --> 13:04.080]  basically no COVID deaths, this is on national Japanese television by the way, and that in
[13:04.080 --> 13:09.600]  the African countries that didn't hand out ibermectin, they have giant deaths, now imagine
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.440]  these are real medical doctors, but oh the young Turks, they laugh at us, so, oh the
[13:15.440 --> 13:21.600]  surgeon general, he laughs and says natural immunity is not good, it doesn't help you,
[13:21.600 --> 13:26.320]  that's like saying you don't need water in the desert, cars don't need gasoline, 18 wheelers
[13:26.320 --> 13:33.560]  don't need diesel, and engines don't need oil, and plants don't need water, okay, alright,
[13:33.560 --> 13:42.000]  this is their criminal will against us, they're disdain for us at that level, so we've seen
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.760]  the delta variant or whatever you want to call this, synthetic garbage, whatever it
[13:45.760 --> 13:52.480]  is, race through Austin, race through businesses, race through here, and people that would go
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.920]  home sick without seeing a doctor or even going to see the doctor, they say there's
[13:55.920 --> 14:00.240]  nothing for you, if you get bad enough we'll put you on a breathing machine, and within
[14:00.240 --> 14:07.160]  six, seven hours of taking ibermectin, everybody turned the corner and got better, including
[14:07.160 --> 14:12.360]  my parents and so many other people, just like instant, take the ibermectin three, four
[14:12.360 --> 14:22.480]  hours later, it's like wow, what just happened, and not from an animal supply store, got it
[14:22.480 --> 14:29.760]  from a medical doctor, cost ten dollars, and that's the reality, people I know, so they
[14:29.760 --> 14:39.440]  felt like they were hit by a truck, and so this is coming off of the, vaccinated, this
[14:39.440 --> 14:43.680]  is the, this is the sloughing, this is the shedding, and I have the medical studies on
[14:43.680 --> 14:50.600]  that today, so, so here's the huge stories, Israeli study, natural immunity to delta or
[14:50.600 --> 14:55.840]  regular COVID, 13 times better if it's natural, but they want you to take a shot that ruins
[14:55.840 --> 15:02.480]  that immunity and makes you super sick, they just want you to ignore science, and then
[15:02.480 --> 15:08.080]  these so-called vaccines aren't vaccines that don't work, and lower your immunity, and then
[15:08.080 --> 15:14.040]  begin to create these syndromes that they've seen, not just in chickens, but in other animals
[15:14.040 --> 15:18.080]  as well, that they give them an inoculation supposedly to stop the common cold, because
[15:18.080 --> 15:21.880]  it turns out the common cold is part of our body and part of how we communicate with other
[15:21.880 --> 15:29.040]  creatures and how we share information, so we're creating an autoimmune response to ourselves,
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.880]  and now humans are getting Merrick's disease, and you've got them lying and suppressing
[15:34.880 --> 15:38.360]  that, and then you've got them suppressing the natural immunity, and then you've got
[15:38.360 --> 15:44.280]  them suppressing that damn right, they've had Italian and Mexican doctors confirm that
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.840]  there is liquid metal in these shots, and now the Japanese have confirmed it, the Japanese
[15:49.840 --> 15:54.240]  government just rejected it and said, what the hell is this?
[15:54.240 --> 15:59.440]  This is full of some kind of weird metal, what are you pushing on us?
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.280]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.960]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.960 --> 16:08.960]  Here's why.
[16:08.960 --> 16:12.960]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.960 --> 16:18.240]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most, and unlike
[16:18.240 --> 16:24.240]  gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless
[16:24.240 --> 16:27.000]  supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.880]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[16:30.880 --> 16:35.640]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.640 --> 16:40.920]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[16:40.920 --> 16:41.920]  too.

[17:04.680 --> 17:05.680]  news.

[17:08.800 --> 17:14.360]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.

[17:22.440 --> 17:23.600]  The best part?

[19:58.020 --> 20:03.860]  and we're just really proud of the work you're doing, Mike.
[20:03.860 --> 20:17.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.860 --> 20:25.060]  All over the world for more than 30 years, since the Japanese invented it again. I've
[20:25.060 --> 20:31.140]  never met them. This is longer than that. They've learned that if you give it to people in viral
[20:31.140 --> 20:36.980]  areas, it just knocks out viral infections. It stops the dividing, just like zinc does,
[20:36.980 --> 20:41.860]  just like hydroxychloroquine. And I know listeners, you've all known this for 18, 19 months,
[20:41.860 --> 20:47.060]  thanks to Zotter Zelenko and many others. But now you see the full court press all over the news
[20:47.060 --> 20:56.820]  saying, how dare these crazy people go on Amazon or wherever they go and get the horse
[20:56.820 --> 21:01.220]  ivermectin, which works great, by the way. It's on record. It's the same stuff you get from the
[21:01.220 --> 21:08.260]  doctor, just in pill form. Oh, the vitamin C isn't going to help you. The vitamin D isn't
[21:08.260 --> 21:12.020]  going to help you. The zinc isn't going to help you. No, no, no. Just wait until you can't breathe,
[21:12.020 --> 21:15.620]  and they go to the hospital, and we'll put a tube down your throat and blow your lungs out and kill
[21:15.620 --> 21:22.500]  your ass. I know people personally, they wouldn't give any drugs or help at the hospital, and they
[21:22.500 --> 21:29.460]  went home and got on ivermectin and got on Rob Do and got better very quickly.
[21:31.620 --> 21:37.940]  Happened to my parents. Go to a regular doctor. We have no help for you. Get on the phone with a
[21:37.940 --> 21:42.420]  well-known Texas doctor, or I'll soon have on air, call the prescriptions within hours.
[21:42.420 --> 21:46.420]  My dad went from looking like he was going to die to be enough walking around the next day. He'd
[21:46.420 --> 21:51.460]  had chairs delivered a week before he had to put together for the first pool. He was outside
[21:51.460 --> 21:57.140]  putting them together better. I thought he was going to die when I went over there. He didn't
[21:57.140 --> 22:02.980]  tell me he'd been sick for a week. Usually, you're sick of just laying bed and drink water. Uh-uh,
[22:02.980 --> 22:09.940]  not with this stuff, because it keeps replicating, because it's synthetic. And so think about these
[22:09.940 --> 22:15.860]  murdering criminals when you see the Surgeon General. That's a person who has your good faith,
[22:15.860 --> 22:22.740]  who's supposedly the doctor of America, working for Fauci and Bill Gates, lying to you and saying,
[22:22.740 --> 22:29.700]  ivermectin is bad, don't take it, and saying natural immunity is no good.
[22:29.700 --> 22:37.380]  Well, you want to play the clip again? You've seen it. Again, that's like saying you don't need
[22:37.380 --> 22:42.420]  you don't need water in the desert or you don't need a life jacket if you're thrown out the middle
[22:42.420 --> 22:49.940]  of the Atlantic Ocean. I mean, this is criminal behavior, not just negligence, but deliberately
[22:51.860 --> 22:59.060]  hurting people. And it's because they represent the globalist and we are in at war. You know,
[22:59.060 --> 23:08.500]  Laura Ingram and Tucker Carlson are the only national talk show host on TV that have talked
[23:08.500 --> 23:12.500]  about Operation Lockstep or the globalist, their whole program. We're going to play a clip of that
[23:12.500 --> 23:19.060]  in a moment. But I'm going to start where I started again yesterday. If we don't admit we're in a war,
[23:19.060 --> 23:23.780]  if we don't admit the globalist, her enemy, if we don't admit they fully capture the Democratic Party,
[23:23.780 --> 23:28.580]  if we don't admit they control almost all the national news, and if we don't admit they control
[23:28.580 --> 23:36.500]  admit that they're literally out to get us, we don't have any hope. This is a premeditated plan.
[23:37.940 --> 23:44.580]  The head doctor in Tokyo says he's talked to thousands of doctors that have treated
[23:44.580 --> 23:52.020]  tens of thousands of people with a 100% cure rate with ivermectin and those that don't have it die.
[23:52.020 --> 24:02.980]  And then I personally have seen it with my own family and then I sit there and watch that evil.
[24:04.580 --> 24:07.460]  Surgeon general tell me natural immunity doesn't exist
[24:09.460 --> 24:14.980]  and ivermectin's no good. That's like saying don't give that baby mother's milk, babies don't need
[24:14.980 --> 24:23.060]  food, put it in a crib, close the door, go on a vacation for a week, come back the baby's dead. It's
[24:23.060 --> 24:27.940]  that level of lying, don't you give that baby milk, lock that baby in the closet.
[24:30.500 --> 24:36.260]  You'd say you're a crazy person, you're a criminal, but oh it's a guy in an admiral outfit, so it
[24:36.260 --> 24:44.340]  must be okay. What type of freak show, twilight zone world do we wake up in? Well these are globalist,
[24:45.140 --> 24:53.700]  these are enemies of the country, they're at war with us and you keep wondering why they keep
[24:53.700 --> 25:01.300]  attacking, you keep wondering why they keep lying. Saki came out, in fact she's that up for next
[25:01.300 --> 25:05.940]  segment. She remembers she came out two days ago and said oh we've got a pandemic, we're running a
[25:05.940 --> 25:13.780]  pandemic because that's what they call it behind the scenes, it's funny to them. It's their pretext
[25:13.780 --> 25:19.060]  for total martial law, it's their pretext for total societal control at every level.
[25:22.100 --> 25:26.980]  They just announced in Australia, oh we're never going to end the lockdown,
[25:27.620 --> 25:31.380]  turns out there'll always be COVID so you'll always be locked down.
[25:31.380 --> 25:36.660]  Don't look at the sunset, don't talk to your neighbors,
[25:37.860 --> 25:41.780]  you know I told my mother last night I went and saw her, I told her they're on TV saying
[25:42.340 --> 25:45.780]  don't look at the sunset, don't talk to your neighbors, she said come on they're not saying
[25:45.780 --> 25:54.340]  that and I showed her Australia. I mean folks this is cult programming and they know exactly
[25:54.340 --> 26:03.140]  what they're doing. You understand that they need to have multiple viruses, multiple vaccines,
[26:03.140 --> 26:08.900]  multiple systems injected and they want you in a ritual to come back over and over again
[26:08.900 --> 26:10.740]  and when you get the third round of shots,
[26:15.060 --> 26:20.900]  it absolutely boosts the level of mutations in you that you then release on the general public
[26:20.900 --> 26:26.020]  just like they do in poultry populations and that's coming up next segment.
[26:26.020 --> 26:32.020]  So I just go back to how big this is. The Japanese government, here's the articles,
[26:32.020 --> 26:38.500]  breaking update, foreign material containing in Japanese Moderna jabs, a substance that reacts
[26:38.500 --> 26:44.260]  to magnets, it could be metal, that was yesterday, now they've come out and said it is metal.
[26:44.260 --> 26:50.660]  Japan suspects contamination of Moderna vaccines is metallic, reacts to magnets.
[26:52.820 --> 26:55.620]  Government officials told the Nikai,
[26:59.220 --> 27:06.180]  this is like the government saying this and here's the Japanese government saying
[27:06.180 --> 27:13.220]  100% of our patients cure with ivermectin and then they show the African statistics as well
[27:14.580 --> 27:21.540]  by country by country. Now there's basically no deaths if you have ivermectin preemptively
[27:23.540 --> 27:28.420]  and massive deaths if you don't have it. But don't you try to share this on Facebook,
[27:28.420 --> 27:33.700]  or Twitter, or Google, or YouTube because you'll get blocked because these groups are eugenicist,
[27:33.700 --> 27:41.860]  murdering, transhumanist, committed to pure evil to suppress knowledge, to suppress medical doctors,
[27:41.860 --> 27:49.460]  to carry out their bio attack. And that's why they're all over the news. Now they have TV PSAs.
[27:49.460 --> 27:54.900]  I saw one on Twitter saying, you're not a cow, you're not a horse, are you? Then what are you
[27:54.900 --> 28:03.140]  doing taking ivermectin? Don't you do that? Oh gee golly, you're not a horse, you're not a cow.
[28:03.140 --> 28:08.500]  Talking to you like, oh conspiracy theories are, they're crazier. They wear tin full hats. Yeah,
[28:08.500 --> 28:12.420]  all those medical doctors around the world, all those scientists, yeah they're real crazy.
[28:13.060 --> 28:18.500]  Those African governments tell their people take it. And imagine being signed on to this
[28:18.500 --> 28:22.420]  for a few thousand dollars. That's what they pay the average influencer.
[28:25.540 --> 28:30.420]  We're going to go to break and come back with great details and the specifics drilling down
[28:30.420 --> 28:35.060]  in to how they're wounding us with these injections and what their master plan is.
[28:35.700 --> 28:41.060]  That's coming up. Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, the only way we stay on air is your

[29:01.620 --> 29:06.820]  in a crazy COVID culture? Me too. But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting
[29:06.820 --> 29:12.100]  studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune
[29:12.100 --> 29:16.660]  system health can literally be the difference between life and death. You probably already
[29:16.660 --> 29:21.780]  believe that. I certainly do. So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out
[29:21.780 --> 29:28.340]  which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:28.340 --> 29:33.700]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefense.com.
[29:33.700 --> 29:38.900]  No cures or treatments there. Instead, little known but shocking immune system research

[30:01.140 --> 30:07.060]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on,
[30:07.940 --> 30:13.540]  and that its criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public. They do the same
[30:13.540 --> 30:19.620]  things over and over again, and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[30:20.580 --> 30:28.660]  Well, guess what? It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV
[30:28.660 --> 30:32.500]  and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[30:32.500 --> 30:37.780]  than HIV, and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually
[30:37.780 --> 30:43.700]  go attack the T1 for sites in the body and create autoimmune disorders. The problem for them was
[30:43.700 --> 30:49.300]  the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road. That's why they need
[30:49.300 --> 30:54.180]  to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your
[30:54.180 --> 31:10.020]  immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV. That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:24.500 --> 31:29.060]  Supplies last. X-2's been sold out for a while. It's now back in stock. It's discounted while

[32:00.100 --> 32:05.220]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point. It's very bittersweet. Everything we've talked about
[32:05.220 --> 32:09.060]  has happened just like we said it would, and now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care
[32:09.060 --> 32:13.380]  about that. I care about beating the new world order. And it's because we have so much credibility,
[32:13.380 --> 32:17.780]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer. And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[32:17.780 --> 32:22.260]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons. I can't tell you what's going on, but let's just say this.
[32:22.260 --> 32:26.660]  We're going to see this through to the end. We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[32:26.660 --> 32:31.300]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at infowarstore.com. They're great products,
[32:31.300 --> 32:36.020]  plus they fund the operation. So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[32:36.020 --> 32:40.180]  Do they fund freedom? No, a lot of them don't. These are great products that fund freedom
[32:40.180 --> 32:45.300]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth. That's why the globalists
[32:45.300 --> 32:49.540]  are censoring. They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[32:49.540 --> 32:53.700]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word. Download everything
[32:53.700 --> 32:57.620]  we've done. You can find and save it because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[32:57.620 --> 33:16.020]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:27.940 --> 33:32.420]  Every solution to this problem. There is no political solution to this problem. I don't care
[33:32.420 --> 33:37.700]  what you want to believe. If you believe there is, look me in the eye and maybe one time in human
[33:37.700 --> 33:44.420]  history where the people have voted their way out of tyranny. It doesn't exist. So I'm going to call
[33:44.420 --> 33:49.700]  Maxime Bernier right now and he's really for the people. I invite you, come up on stage,
[33:49.700 --> 33:57.780]  stand beside me and say you support united non-compliance. That's the equivalent of giving power back to
[33:57.780 --> 34:03.860]  the people and that's what a real leader needs to do. A real leader doesn't want to manage the
[34:03.860 --> 34:10.660]  takeover of society while giving you lip service. A real leader will tell you the truth. I can't
[34:10.660 --> 34:15.700]  save you. That's the reality. If I'm up here telling you I'm going to save you, vote for me,
[34:15.700 --> 34:21.860]  I'm lying to you. You cannot vote your freedom back. I'm going to tell you the truth. I can lead
[34:21.860 --> 34:29.700]  my example and show you how to save yourselves. That's what we've got to do and how do we do it?
[34:29.700 --> 34:35.220]  We just say no. Everyone's like, what do I do with this man? What do I do with this batch? It's
[34:35.220 --> 34:41.700]  very simple. If you have a batch card, you burn it. If you hide it on your phone, you delete it.
[34:41.700 --> 34:45.700]  If you have an appointment for a job, you just say no.
[34:50.580 --> 34:54.740]  And if they want a man in a work, if they want a man in a school, they think we're going to
[34:54.740 --> 35:01.620]  shove it down your throat. It's very simple. You go on strike, teachers, lawyers, doctors,
[35:01.620 --> 35:08.820]  police, firefighters, paramedics, frontline workers, students. Why don't you just stay home
[35:08.820 --> 35:13.780]  for a couple of days? What do you think they're going to do? Let it go for months? No. After two,
[35:13.780 --> 35:19.060]  three days, they'll came to the power of the people because that's what United Not Compliance is.
[35:19.060 --> 35:25.460]  It is people's power. We are that power. Look around. They cannot stop what's coming.
[35:25.460 --> 35:30.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know what's going to happen. You know the solution. You have no excuse.
[35:30.180 --> 35:34.740]  You have to get off your ass. You have to take action. We have to learn to stand up for ourselves.
[35:34.740 --> 35:43.220]  We have to learn to stand up for ourselves. That was Chris Skye in Canada. He got arrested
[35:43.220 --> 35:49.460]  right after that speech and then released another fake warrant. This is a scientific
[35:49.460 --> 35:58.020]  media government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com
[35:58.020 --> 36:05.460]  studios. It's Alex Jones. This is a scientific takeover that's taking place and people have to
[36:05.460 --> 36:12.660]  recognize what it is and say no to it. Submitting to it will kill you better than a hammer. Now,
[36:12.660 --> 36:16.660]  I'm going to restart the transmission here in a few minutes because I got a lot of news to cover
[36:16.660 --> 36:23.140]  and a lot to go over here with Harrison Smith here on the Alex Jones show. But speaking again to
[36:23.140 --> 36:28.820]  the spirit of what Chris Skye was saying up in Canada a few days ago, here is Greg Reese's report
[36:28.820 --> 36:33.940]  on getting ready and getting prepared now and people now understand this. It's causing a giant
[36:33.940 --> 36:39.540]  awakening. That's good, but we need leadership and government to realize this is 21st century
[36:39.540 --> 36:45.140]  warfare. This is a globalist takeover and that's the only way to stop it is fully admitting that
[36:45.140 --> 36:50.740]  it is completely warlike and predatory and exterminist. It does not just want to conquer
[36:50.740 --> 36:54.180]  us to take us over. It wants to conquer us to kill us. Here it is.
[37:02.100 --> 37:10.580]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us that the harder
[37:10.580 --> 37:18.660]  the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. These words written by Thomas Paine about the American
[37:18.660 --> 37:26.740]  crisis nearly 250 years ago are now felt more deeply than ever by so many of us all over the
[37:26.740 --> 37:36.020]  world and thank God because humanity needs us all more than ever. Tyranny is having its final act
[37:36.020 --> 37:43.300]  and if we don't stand against it then all that is good shall be lost. Things are very different
[37:43.300 --> 37:50.980]  than they were back in 1776. We have become domesticated, soft and weak, but the harder
[37:50.980 --> 37:58.260]  the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. The world we are saying goodbye to, what pop culture
[37:58.260 --> 38:06.100]  has been calling normal, was not all that great. It was overblown consumerism fueled by greedy
[38:06.100 --> 38:14.660]  corruption and lies. What comes next, our new normal, is going to ultimately be decided by the
[38:14.660 --> 38:22.180]  people. We know exactly what will happen if we do nothing. The brainwashed, compliant masses
[38:22.180 --> 38:28.260]  will accept the lie that their natural immune system is insufficient. They will accept the
[38:28.260 --> 38:36.020]  entire transhumanist nightmare trap and it all begins with the vaccine passport. The vaccine
[38:36.020 --> 38:44.500]  passport is the ultimate offer of tyranny. If we accept it then it's all over. They are the CCP's
[38:44.500 --> 38:51.540]  social credit score but worse. You will be required to have your body penetrated with whatever so
[38:51.540 --> 38:58.020]  called vaccine booster shot or whatever your government decides to inject inside of you
[38:58.740 --> 39:02.100]  and if you refuse then you won't be allowed to buy food
[39:02.100 --> 39:09.540]  and you won't be allowed to travel. If you don't want to get vaccinated that's your choice but
[39:09.540 --> 39:15.060]  don't think you can get on a plane or a train beside vaccinated people and put them at risk.
[39:15.620 --> 39:21.540]  Because the vaccine passport will be linked to everything. This is all happening right now
[39:22.340 --> 39:27.940]  but the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph and what could be more glorious
[39:27.940 --> 39:34.740]  than all of awakened humanity standing up once and for all against the tyranny that threatens
[39:34.740 --> 39:43.380]  our very existence. Australia is rising up against the tyrannical lockdowns. France is rising up.
[39:44.180 --> 39:51.300]  More and more people joining every day because individual freedom ends with the vaccine passport.
[39:51.300 --> 39:58.580]  There is no one coming to save us which is how it should be. Independence cannot be bestowed.
[39:59.460 --> 40:05.460]  Their only weapon against us is mental. They make us feel small, hopeless and afraid
[40:06.020 --> 40:10.820]  to domesticate us to their will. They encourage disease over good health.
[40:11.620 --> 40:19.140]  Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered but we know how to defeat them. Fear no man
[40:19.140 --> 40:26.580]  and have faith. Do not mourn the lost days of a sick and diseased normalcy. Celebrate it.
[40:27.300 --> 40:35.460]  Be present. Be healthy. Be joyful. Enjoy the sunset. Hug your loved ones. Love each other
[40:36.020 --> 40:40.820]  and rise up together against tyranny so that our children will know freedom.
[40:42.100 --> 40:44.420]  For Infowars.com this is Greg Rees.
[40:44.420 --> 40:51.060]  All right. Very important report with us 15 minutes to the next hour ahead of Ashley Babbitt's
[40:51.860 --> 40:56.260]  widower joining us to talk about the celebration her killers have been having
[40:56.260 --> 41:01.220]  on TV of what a hero he is. How about rubbing it in is Harris and Smith are going to break here
[41:01.220 --> 41:06.020]  in a few minutes but this really is a declared war against humanity. We have all the pieces.
[41:06.020 --> 41:10.340]  We have the facts. We have the suppressing treatments. We have the pushing poisons on us
[41:10.340 --> 41:14.980]  and we have Merrick's disease which we now see similar things happening to humans
[41:14.980 --> 41:20.020]  and scientists warning this was coming. So this is a very formulaic plan and then under
[41:20.020 --> 41:26.180]  Merrick's disease the chickens must have a final vaccine or they will all die and then the government
[41:26.180 --> 41:32.500]  or the controller of the chickens has complete control over their lives. Yeah it's it's really
[41:32.500 --> 41:36.420]  sick and strangely enough this was an anonymous post on a message board. I don't know who wrote it
[41:36.420 --> 41:41.220]  but it was sounded interesting to me. So I started looking into it. Turns out everything that they
[41:41.220 --> 41:45.700]  said was true. So of course I had to send it to you immediately because this when you when you
[41:45.700 --> 41:51.140]  look at Merrick's disease and the path that that disease took in relation to the vaccines that were
[41:51.140 --> 41:57.940]  so-called leaky or allowed transmission but didn't allow them to show any evidence of the vaccine or
[41:57.940 --> 42:04.660]  any evidence of the virus like no symptoms massively dangerous. It really is everything
[42:04.660 --> 42:10.260]  coming together to explain exactly what's going on here and frankly it's very worrying because
[42:10.260 --> 42:15.860]  just as you said it basically gets to a point where you have to get the vaccine and if you don't
[42:15.860 --> 42:20.340]  get the vaccine you really will die because it basically just makes the virus more and more virulent
[42:20.340 --> 42:25.700]  more and more dangerous. So the more you vaccinate the more dangerous it gets and it's almost a
[42:25.700 --> 42:32.180]  feedback loop that is just in total death. And there's a final vaccine for the super virus that
[42:32.180 --> 42:36.740]  kills 100 percent of what other animal has been through this whether it be chickens humans it
[42:36.740 --> 42:42.740]  doesn't matter but then you are still you still have it and so it colonizes you you become one
[42:42.740 --> 42:49.460]  big tumor. Right. I was reading it. Yeah oh it's disgusting it's it's insane. So wow folks no wonder
[42:49.460 --> 42:53.060]  everybody gets these shots and grows tumors everywhere that's what they're designed to do.
[42:53.620 --> 42:55.700]  Thank you Bill Gates you're such a sweet person.
[42:55.700 --> 43:05.700]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[43:05.700 --> 43:11.140]  and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[43:11.140 --> 43:17.620]  water is a big problem. Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[43:17.620 --> 43:23.140]  and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[43:23.140 --> 43:28.340]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the
[43:28.340 --> 43:34.740]  third eye also described as the seat of the soul. The pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[43:34.740 --> 43:40.900]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality. Fluoride free water
[43:40.900 --> 43:47.060]  is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy. Our water filtration systems with the proper
[43:47.060 --> 43:53.620]  filters will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal.

[43:59.460 --> 44:04.900]  So when I first started taking survival skills basically I was 275 pounds overweight. I had
[44:04.900 --> 44:10.020]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was barely holding on to a job and I heard Dr. Group on
[44:10.020 --> 44:13.860]  your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original survival skills
[44:13.860 --> 44:18.100]  the X1 and it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too.
[44:18.100 --> 44:21.620]  You have you know with a deeper source you know and I got really excited about that so I took
[44:21.620 --> 44:28.180]  it and then in two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[44:28.180 --> 44:33.380]  You know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next
[44:33.380 --> 44:37.780]  couple of years I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[44:37.780 --> 44:43.060]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one I like recently is knockout literally like if
[44:43.060 --> 44:47.220]  you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works. But anyway so the point is we have to
[44:47.220 --> 44:51.780]  get ourselves clean. We have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is
[44:51.780 --> 44:56.900]  to take our own health into our own hand. Beautifully said brother I thank you so much for your call
[44:56.900 --> 45:04.420]  and godspeed. I'm not funded by George Soros. I'm not funded by the Democratic Party. I'm funded

[46:05.540 --> 46:09.620]  for a hundred years with those that humans are bad and evil and a pest looks on the earth so that
[46:09.620 --> 46:14.980]  we begin to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics based globalists
[46:14.980 --> 46:20.260]  take control of the planet if you let a clown swab the evidence groups own wikipedia page
[46:20.260 --> 46:26.100]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide
[46:26.100 --> 46:32.260]  to set up corporate dictatorship under the un they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns
[46:32.260 --> 46:38.420]  they release the viruses they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources
[46:38.420 --> 46:43.860]  so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives that's how i was able to predict
[46:43.860 --> 46:50.660]  everything they did decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because
[46:50.660 --> 46:56.500]  they have a detailed battle plan we cover it live weekdays 11 a.m to 3 p.m at info wars.com
[46:56.500 --> 47:09.860]  for slice show tell everybody to tune in now and war the world you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:15.620 --> 47:21.460]  all right we're back live on this friday edition this is not an x files show this is not fiction
[47:21.460 --> 47:26.740]  this is the real world this information can save the country and the planet
[47:28.020 --> 47:33.300]  as soon as i saw this information i was already researching it and i'm really glad that harrison
[47:33.300 --> 47:37.460]  smith ride shot done with us here on the alex jones show today gave me this and then he was
[47:37.460 --> 47:42.340]  covering it this morning on american journal that he hosts 8 a.m to 11 a.m so i was watching it
[47:43.060 --> 47:48.660]  and i remember again 16 17 18 months ago covering all the bill gates and faulty testing
[47:48.660 --> 47:56.100]  and all the amount of vaccines quote for poultry particularly chickens and how they had the
[47:56.100 --> 48:01.060]  problems giving them these vaccines that would create a super vaccine that killed 100 of the
[48:01.060 --> 48:07.060]  chickens so they would then give them another super vaccine that would block that but never got rid
[48:07.060 --> 48:13.060]  of the virus it's called a leaky vaccine right where you're a harbinger and hold it and the whole
[48:13.060 --> 48:18.820]  body the nerves expand tumors grow everywhere and and now i guess the fd age is a few weeks ago
[48:18.820 --> 48:23.620]  that's why this is in the news shed oh the u.s can sell people chicken that's like 80 percent tumors
[48:24.420 --> 48:28.180]  and and and so that's what this is now they're supposed to kill all the chickens that have it
[48:28.180 --> 48:33.220]  but they don't and so that's their plan colonize us take us over because they're giving us basically
[48:33.220 --> 48:43.220]  the same shots uh so it's huge tell us about marix disease because that's a a key answer here
[48:43.220 --> 48:46.500]  about what they're doing to us yeah it's a blueprint and just like you said it's not fiction
[48:46.500 --> 48:51.700]  it's also not uh speculation i mean this actually happened this isn't i have all the scientific
[48:51.700 --> 48:56.100]  articles that you could ever need so this is what actually happened and here i'll just read this uh
[48:56.100 --> 49:01.060]  this anonymous post i would love to credit whoever this is uh but i i looked into all of this and it
[49:01.060 --> 49:05.620]  seems to be exactly sure it's the anonymous post that pointed you at mpr and associated press and
[49:05.620 --> 49:10.580]  exactly pbs and national geographic and and and all the science go ahead yeah exactly and in the
[49:10.580 --> 49:15.140]  nih i'll show you the studies and everything uh but but this post really ties in exactly how
[49:15.140 --> 49:20.500]  dangerous this truly is so he says if the vaccine works as they say which means it's reduced reduces
[49:20.500 --> 49:25.460]  symptoms but does not prevent transmission then what you're looking at is the exact same scenario
[49:25.460 --> 49:31.140]  as marix disease in chickens this vaccine for poultry reduces symptoms but does not prevent infection
[49:31.140 --> 49:36.820]  or transmission has promoted the evolution of a hyper deadly strain now all chickens must be
[49:36.820 --> 49:41.300]  vaccinated against this strain or they will die if they're if they're infected and infected they will
[49:41.300 --> 49:45.780]  be mortality of chickens infected with marix disease is quite low decades after the first
[49:45.780 --> 49:50.740]  vaccine was introduced uh current strains of maric virus caused lymphoma formation on throughout
[49:50.740 --> 49:56.260]  the chicken's body and mortality rates have reached 100% in unvaccinated chickens the marix
[49:56.260 --> 50:01.940]  disease vaccine is a leaky vaccine which means only the symptoms of the disease are prevented and
[50:01.940 --> 50:07.460]  that's the key there because we know that the cdc came out with a renewed mask mandate specifically
[50:07.460 --> 50:12.100]  because they had to admit that the vaccines did not stop transmission originally they came out
[50:12.100 --> 50:17.060]  and they said the vaccine it stops transmission it stops uh symptoms it stops everything it's great
[50:17.060 --> 50:20.500]  and then they had now they say no you're colonized by it and they say it actually you actually have
[50:20.500 --> 50:24.980]  more in you if you are vaccinated you you don't have any symptoms when you actually have a higher
[50:24.980 --> 50:29.300]  rate of viral load within you don't have the stories here which we predicted a year and a
[50:29.300 --> 50:34.660]  half ago this is all pre-planned right because this vaccine being an mRNA vaccine is totally unique
[50:34.660 --> 50:39.220]  and totally unlike previous vaccines and i'll explain again from nationalgeographic.com where
[50:39.220 --> 50:44.740]  they explain that perfectly but first you've got cdc report shows that vaccinated people can spread
[50:44.740 --> 50:48.820]  COVID-19 remember that actor guy got got all mad he was like i got the vaccine and now i'm a super
[50:48.820 --> 50:53.380]  spreader and this was this is what that was about it turns out you spread it more now right they had
[50:53.380 --> 50:57.700]  to admit it the newly released report shows the vaccinating people can still be super spreaders
[50:57.700 --> 51:01.780]  drove the recent decision by the cdc to once again recommend masks for vaccinated people indoors
[51:01.780 --> 51:06.260]  where case counts are high etc the viral load of vaccinated people with breakthrough cases is the same
[51:06.260 --> 51:10.980]  as in unvaccinated people the cdc said friday this was july 30th of course every week we're getting
[51:10.980 --> 51:15.460]  new updates where we learn that a maybe things aren't quite as good as we think and npr says it as
[51:15.460 --> 51:19.780]  well vaccinated people with breakthrough infections can spread the delta variant and now they admit
[51:19.780 --> 51:25.380]  this a week later you're they're actually worse yeah exactly yeah 250 times or percent sometimes
[51:26.100 --> 51:30.900]  so going to national geographic the story about marix disease they say marix is caused by highly
[51:30.900 --> 51:35.940]  contagious virus related to the one that causes herpes in humans remember we've seen weird things
[51:35.940 --> 51:39.780]  with herpes people getting herpes and shingles that take the shots yeah so a lot of sort of
[51:39.780 --> 51:44.500]  similarities here uh it causes paralysis and cancer in the 1970s new vaccines brought the
[51:44.500 --> 51:48.980]  disease under control but marix didn't go gently into that good night within 10 years it started
[51:48.980 --> 51:53.300]  evolving into more virulent strange which now trigger more severe cancers and afflict chickens
[51:53.300 --> 51:58.500]  at earlier ages andrew reid from the pennsylvania pennsylvania state university thinks the vaccines
[51:58.500 --> 52:03.780]  were responsible the marix vaccine is imperfect or leaky that is it protects chickens from
[52:03.780 --> 52:08.580]  developing disease but doesn't stop them from becoming infected or from spreading the virus
[52:08.580 --> 52:12.820]  inadvertently it made it easier for the more virulent strains to survive which literally
[52:12.820 --> 52:18.020]  sounds to me exactly like how they describe the cdc vaccine and they point out that previously
[52:18.020 --> 52:22.900]  this was not a problem with human vaccines they say we're we're vaccination fosters the evolution
[52:22.900 --> 52:27.460]  of more virulent disease this does not apply to most human vaccines those against mumps measles
[52:27.460 --> 52:32.980]  rubella and smallpox smallpox are perfect that is they protect against the disease and they stop
[52:32.980 --> 52:38.820]  people from transmitting the respective virus now of course this was uh an article from a long
[52:38.820 --> 52:43.060]  time ago before you know they had to start covering up for the current vaccine but they admit here
[52:43.060 --> 52:46.740]  that the previous vaccines against things like mumps and rubella and that were perfect they
[52:46.740 --> 52:51.220]  stopped transmission and they stopped infection this is 2015 and of course they're not really
[52:51.220 --> 52:56.900]  perfect they're contaminated with cancer viruses most polios caused by the vaccines but but if you
[52:56.900 --> 53:01.220]  thought the old vaccines were bad this is light years worse likely vaccine enhanced spread of
[53:01.220 --> 53:07.460]  deadlier chicken viruses that is national geographic again we have right here for you uh
[53:08.820 --> 53:15.300]  marix disease in chickens from major university report yeah totally well documented here's pbs
[53:15.300 --> 53:23.860]  this chicken vaccine makes its virus more dangerous marix disease in chickens and then the uh person
[53:23.860 --> 53:29.140]  online making the point you read about all this and and again it goes back to the testing that's
[53:29.140 --> 53:33.700]  why they skipped the animal testing because they'd already done it under the name of other vaccines
[53:33.700 --> 53:38.100]  but very similar so they knew what it was going to do right that's why they didn't want any testing
[53:38.100 --> 53:42.340]  and there's actually a clip that's been making the rounds recently of dr. Fauci early on in the
[53:42.340 --> 53:46.100]  uh in the coronavirus outbreak where he's saying well we have to be very careful with the vaccines
[53:46.100 --> 53:51.940]  because you can have ade which is anti potty uh enhancement enhancement yeah yeah exactly um
[53:52.740 --> 53:57.300]  so that's sort of another aspect of this and he says you know but this usually comes out in
[53:57.300 --> 54:01.460]  the animal testing well very convenient we didn't do animal testing this time so it didn't come out
[54:01.460 --> 54:06.580]  so obviously the big plan is get as many people sick as they can they know those types of people
[54:06.580 --> 54:11.220]  won't admit they've been set up in use stockholm syndrome give them even more shots use them to
[54:11.220 --> 54:16.180]  release even more variants more death than blame those of us that aren't injected as causing the
[54:16.180 --> 54:22.420]  mass death and then create a total hysterical stampede towards checkpoints authoritarianism
[54:22.420 --> 54:26.980]  medical ideas uh and the arrest and locking up of those that won't take the shots and then
[54:26.980 --> 54:31.220]  protect the population which you already see happening in spain australia and canada which
[54:31.220 --> 54:35.300]  is the beta test for us right it's practically inevitable i mean you have enough these people
[54:35.300 --> 54:40.180]  taking the vaccine not showing symptoms of the virus but still harboring the virus and
[54:40.180 --> 54:43.940]  transmitting the virus you you are going to inevitably have mutations that are going to
[54:43.940 --> 54:48.740]  get worse i mean even yesterday cnn had the headline that was like uh it it's covid is
[54:48.740 --> 54:52.340]  worse than it's ever been it was worse than this time last year and we didn't have the vaccine
[54:52.340 --> 54:56.180]  last year and it's like all right so you have a virus you invent a vaccine and the virus gets
[54:56.180 --> 55:02.820]  worse something is not connecting and all the scientists we had on warned prestigious ones
[55:02.820 --> 55:09.220]  virologist the former head of murk said this will cause super strains right just like they did with
[55:09.220 --> 55:14.100]  the marix disease and chickens i remember them saying this back at the time right and so we
[55:14.100 --> 55:18.820]  covered this up a year and a half ago about the chickens right and so here it is now back full
[55:18.820 --> 55:23.620]  swing actually happening and what happens by the time they give them a third or fourth shot that's
[55:23.620 --> 55:30.340]  when you get the rise of these viruses that basically kill everybody well and and then yeah
[55:30.340 --> 55:34.100]  then they will have a vaccine for that and then you better damn well take it so see how they're
[55:34.100 --> 55:38.580]  walking us towards this trap yeah that's what i'm saying it's it's almost inevitable like i don't
[55:38.580 --> 55:43.460]  even know if it's too late already because uh you know right now you can you can not take the vaccine
[55:43.460 --> 55:48.340]  and you have a 99 point whatever percent chance of survival the covid virus especially for young
[55:48.340 --> 55:54.420]  and healthy people not as dangerous as many many other diseases but after a year or two or three
[55:54.420 --> 55:58.660]  or four where this has been going through the population and getting stronger and stronger
[55:58.660 --> 56:02.980]  totally you know actually being empowered by the vaccine and then that's all the science and then
[56:02.980 --> 56:07.460]  the young turks lady goes we're gonna have to have lockdowns again because of alex jones we're
[56:07.460 --> 56:13.780]  gonna never be open because he wouldn't take the shot the variant grew in him she said this no lady
[56:13.780 --> 56:19.620]  all the sciences it grew in you dumbass it grew in you yeah no of course it's i i mean it's almost
[56:19.620 --> 56:23.380]  baffling the way that they've gotten but she won't wake up till she's a hundred percent tumors
[56:23.380 --> 56:27.940]  and kept alive like an undead creature by the final vaccine even then she'll still blame you
[56:27.940 --> 56:33.620]  it'll be your fault and i'm not against that poor woman i mean she doesn't read all the science
[56:33.620 --> 56:37.780]  obviously or she's paid off i mean it's all right here let me ask you this we'll come back and cover
[56:37.780 --> 56:43.140]  this well we're gonna go to break but japan has recalled the us vaccines saying they found metal
[56:43.140 --> 56:48.980]  in it ivermectin they say a hundred percent cure why is it being covered up this is all so hardcore
[56:48.980 --> 56:52.900]  we're gonna go to break we're gonna come back please keep us on air get a book get a film

[59:04.260 --> 59:10.180]  i'm from new brink connecticut and i just want to plug in i'm a truck driver and two before us
[59:10.180 --> 59:16.020]  have changed the way i drive me and me and my my brothers that drive there's a couple of us
[59:16.020 --> 59:24.180]  we are hispanics cubans Puerto Ricans we used to be on monster and and red bull and rola and i have
[59:24.180 --> 59:28.180]  lost weight because i stopped drinking all that sugar and i just want to thank you for that man
[59:28.180 --> 59:33.780]  well brother we put more in this than any other long-term high quality energy powder there is
[59:33.780 --> 59:37.460]  so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country he didn't want his name on it because
[59:37.460 --> 59:40.740]  obviously the political issues but we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the
[59:40.740 --> 59:45.540]  design of it and we believe it is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and
[59:45.540 --> 59:48.820]  you're saying that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your truck
[59:48.820 --> 1:00:18.660]  drivers we love you you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:24.260]  harris and spritz tried to shotgun with me here on the alex jones show and he was just
[1:00:24.260 --> 1:00:29.940]  saying hey you know operation lock steps four parts and i love how we're sim potico i was
[1:00:29.940 --> 1:00:35.140]  rereading over some of the four scenarios this weekend and actually meant this week to cover it
[1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:40.660]  and didn't so yeah why don't you explain if we don't capitulate uh to the lockdown and the carbon
[1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:46.500]  tax uh then they're gonna just turn the power off with with a hack attack they run yeah yeah exactly
[1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:50.340]  yeah hack attack a perfect name right for cyber polygon and all this other stuff uh essentially
[1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:53.940]  the way you can look at the lockstep document is there's four scenarios you can see them as plan
[1:00:53.940 --> 1:01:00.180]  a b c and d and essentially plan a is uh clever together and it's everybody willingly going into
[1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:05.860]  globalism uh you know just happily tricked into their own slavery if that doesn't work out they
[1:01:05.860 --> 1:01:11.140]  will go to lockstep lockstep it seems like hasn't worked out fully people are not going 100 over
[1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:16.740]  into their uh their little campaign of enslavement and so i think they've gone on to hack attack
[1:01:16.740 --> 1:01:21.540]  which really lays out exactly the cyber polygon type stuff as well as the natural disasters
[1:01:21.540 --> 1:01:25.460]  that we're seeing all over the place you can also look into the people who wrote that document
[1:01:25.460 --> 1:01:30.100]  uh global business network and uh its founder has connections to the center for new american
[1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:35.540]  security i was doing all this research about afghanistan uh i mean it's it's insane when you
[1:01:35.540 --> 1:01:39.700]  when you really start just typing the names into wikipedia well they admit that they create crises
[1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:43.540]  to get control it's the same people that have kept have kept us in afghanistan are the same
[1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:47.300]  people that wrote the lockstep document and suddenly everything starts making sense it's
[1:01:47.300 --> 1:01:52.180]  literally one big spider web it's insane and they've got all the money because they just
[1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:57.220]  issue fiat currency so that they're buying off almost everybody i mean most of the people you
[1:01:57.220 --> 1:02:02.260]  see with even 10 000 followers folks promoting injections promoting censorship they're being
[1:02:02.260 --> 1:02:06.820]  paid thousands a month to do that right meanwhile facebook kicks people off for saying you're paying
[1:02:06.820 --> 1:02:12.100]  this person to to promote disinformation you can't pay somebody to promote medical disinformation on
[1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:16.740]  the same day that the white house announces they're paying children they're paying underage people to
[1:02:16.740 --> 1:02:21.620]  promote vaccines to underage people that's fine but if you try to do it facebook will eliminate
[1:02:21.620 --> 1:02:25.300]  you from the platform well they'll just lie that they would say that about us and others
[1:02:26.100 --> 1:02:30.740]  that a bunch of people they've banned they go oh you're running secret bot farms they told
[1:02:30.740 --> 1:02:34.500]  roger stone that i mean roger stone's about as technical as i am about that stuff he's not doing
[1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:38.580]  that it's totally alien to them that people would just support us on their own volition like they
[1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:43.860]  don't know they know that i mean they know that that it's happening organically i just wonder
[1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:48.180]  about all the fools that have signed on to this who feel like they're part of the power structure
[1:02:48.180 --> 1:02:51.300]  or maybe they don't even think like that they just think hey i'm getting a couple thousand dollars a
[1:02:51.300 --> 1:02:57.540]  month you know i i am really baffled that that's what is going on in the american mind these days
[1:02:57.540 --> 1:03:01.700]  look at this guy they had a big british presenter die the government sent from a blood clot from the
[1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:06.580]  shot this guy had a heart attack he says he'd do it again yeah talk about stockholm syndrome reporter
[1:03:06.580 --> 1:03:12.260]  hospitalized after jab caused heart inflammation still urges australians to get vaccinated it's
[1:03:12.260 --> 1:03:17.140]  not a vaccine dumbass yeah i think within an hour of that there was a uk presenter that died
[1:03:17.140 --> 1:03:21.620]  complications from the vaccine and uh you know both of both of them in the headlines say rare
[1:03:21.620 --> 1:03:25.860]  condition oh both these people suffered a rare condition it's like wow imagine if it wasn't rare
[1:03:25.860 --> 1:03:30.740]  because it's so rare that so many people i know about heart attacks we actually have new studies
[1:03:30.740 --> 1:03:34.980]  out from around the world out of my stack of what happens people's hearts and the heart's just
[1:03:34.980 --> 1:03:41.860]  clothes when you do this yeah yeah the blood clots are major major concern but man as soon as i started
[1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:46.820]  learning about marix disease and the way that this path took it was like all of these little all of
[1:03:46.820 --> 1:03:50.980]  these little things all these little data points suddenly came together like the you see the stars
[1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:55.060]  and suddenly you see the constellation it's like oh yeah this whole marix disease thing is as big as
[1:03:55.060 --> 1:04:00.340]  everything i mean it's as big as anything yeah because again i didn't put all the pieces together
[1:04:00.340 --> 1:04:06.020]  i said hey this is important a year and a half ago all most of the testing has been in poultry
[1:04:06.820 --> 1:04:12.020]  in china and the u.s. other places these big factory farms trying to keep these animals alive
[1:04:12.020 --> 1:04:16.020]  because common colds come through and wipe them all out but then when they keep giving them vaccines
[1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:20.820]  that's what's causing the bird flu mutations they admit right so so this thing that endangers
[1:04:20.820 --> 1:04:26.260]  humanity and it's going to kill us and it's going to come out of the bird bird you know houses and
[1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:30.580]  then it's the vaccines doing it which is the same thing now they're doing to us and it really never
[1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:35.700]  it really didn't make sense or really didn't coalesce or finalize until they admitted that it
[1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:40.500]  doesn't stop transmission the fact that the vaccine does not stop transmission by the cdc's own
[1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:45.700]  admission is what makes it so dangerous if if it was you know perfect that would just be it would be
[1:04:45.700 --> 1:04:51.140]  an aspect that we didn't have to worry about but since it is a so-called leaky vaccine or allows
[1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:55.540]  transmission uh then that makes it the most dangerous thing we have to identify the global
[1:04:55.540 --> 1:05:01.220]  most let's play that laura ingram club we come back stay there harrison smith it's always critical

[1:06:15.860 --> 1:06:21.620]  far-left rockefeller foundation helped produce a shockingly prescient report on four possible
[1:06:21.620 --> 1:06:27.780]  future scenarios that could play out over the next 15 to 20 years one of them involved a global
[1:06:27.780 --> 1:06:34.100]  pandemic that's remarkably similar to what happened over the last year during this pandemic quote
[1:06:34.100 --> 1:06:39.940]  international mobility of both people and goods screeched to a halt normally bustling shops and
[1:06:39.940 --> 1:06:45.220]  office buildings sat empty for months devoid of both employees and customers national leaders
[1:06:45.220 --> 1:06:50.180]  around the world impose airtight rules and restrictions from the mandatory wearing a face mask
[1:06:50.180 --> 1:07:00.580]  to body temp checks wow that does sound familiar 10 11 years ago the report went on to detail how
[1:07:00.580 --> 1:07:06.820]  the powers that be would never let that imaginary crisis end even after the pandemic faded this
[1:07:06.820 --> 1:07:11.540]  more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck and even
[1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:16.900]  intensified citizens willingly gave up some of their sovereignty and their privacy to more
[1:07:16.900 --> 1:07:22.100]  paternalistic states in exchange for greater safety and stability this heightened oversight
[1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:28.260]  took many forms biometric ids for all citizens title regulations of industries whose stability
[1:07:28.260 --> 1:07:34.740]  was deemed vital to national interest now despite the rockefeller report predating this show by
[1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:39.940]  many years none of what was laid out in that report should surprise any ingram angle viewers
[1:07:39.940 --> 1:07:47.540]  they want never-ending lockdowns and mandates for everything the elites want the u.s trapped
[1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:54.340]  in this forever pandemic look at americans see this as anything but a naked power grab
[1:07:54.340 --> 1:08:01.300]  the pandemic porn will never end and they're going to use it to maintain total control over you
[1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:08.980]  now here are a few a few of the big headlines that tie into what laura ingram was just talking
[1:08:08.980 --> 1:08:15.300]  about we have apple announcing that they're going to read and track and scan everything on your phone
[1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:19.460]  in live time to make sure you're not a bad person while they run death camps in china
[1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:25.540]  and then we have big tech wants you to live in a virtual world prepare for real problems so now
[1:08:25.540 --> 1:08:31.780]  they admit oh we want you to only do zoom for the carbon footprint well we want you to also
[1:08:31.780 --> 1:08:36.980]  wear vr goggles these little hand clips so we can all be in court together or all whatever and be
[1:08:36.980 --> 1:08:46.260]  these little cartoon avatars that are controlled again by big tech this is just a full and complete
[1:08:46.820 --> 1:08:56.580]  takeover of civilization at every level and they admit it's a takeover a hostile corporate
[1:08:56.580 --> 1:09:02.900]  takeover of the physical third dimension of your genetics of your body of your mobility
[1:09:02.900 --> 1:09:09.860]  in their own words they're doing this but it's all done by effeminate men in turtleneck sweaters
[1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:14.900]  and again even that's done by behavioral psychologists so that you don't see them as
[1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:19.620]  threatening it's why their spokesperson are women and minorities and it comes out in their
[1:09:19.620 --> 1:09:25.060]  corporate documents that it that those are seen as less threatening but it's all a bunch of old
[1:09:25.060 --> 1:09:29.860]  white men they're actually rolling this out because they can't conquer the free market
[1:09:29.860 --> 1:09:34.100]  because they can't conquer christians because they can't conquer the human will to be free
[1:09:34.100 --> 1:09:38.740]  they are simply trying to conquer the entire environment and force us in to their own false
[1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:44.260]  reality sounds like what satan tried to do with one third of the angels harrison smith yeah i mean
[1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:48.660]  the amazing thing about it is that it's not even speculation you don't even have to look anymore
[1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:52.420]  it's called the great reset i mean the the infrastructure bill is not making its way
[1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:56.340]  through the congress is litter they're literally calling it the build back better
[1:09:56.340 --> 1:10:04.020]  uh bill i mean it's literally this the great reset talking point i mean they couldn't get more
[1:10:04.020 --> 1:10:08.660]  obvious and it's it's blatant fascism it's a great reset one like the great merger it's the
[1:10:08.660 --> 1:10:15.140]  great combined even calls it build back better even calls it operation lockstep right so i mean
[1:10:15.140 --> 1:10:19.300]  it's there's no need for speculation anymore and man if you want to if you want to start drawing the
[1:10:19.300 --> 1:10:24.580]  lines of of conspiracy i mean look at the author of the lockstep document is the rockfeller foundation
[1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:30.580]  funded it but the author was a global business network i believe peter schwarz works for a sales
[1:10:30.580 --> 1:10:35.540]  force now sales force mark benioff who's tied in with the pope and linda ross child for the
[1:10:36.580 --> 1:10:41.860]  activism stakeholder activism which is claus schwobs world economic forum theory i mean it's
[1:10:41.860 --> 1:10:46.980]  it's literally all tied in together one giant spider web benioff also owns time magazine which
[1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:52.260]  of course put out the great reset cover story and the cover story about how they stole the election
[1:10:52.260 --> 1:10:56.900]  in cahoots with mark zuckerberg i mean you want to talk about a conspiracy this is a
[1:10:56.900 --> 1:11:01.300]  open conspiracy at this point they're not even hiding it and because that's just how well controlled
[1:11:01.300 --> 1:11:05.140]  i guess they have uh the media that they can just announce they're doing this and everybody just
[1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:11.220]  goes along with it and nods along it's it's really truly incredible and they intend to get so many
[1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:16.900]  people sick that we're a victim class now people will get into being sick and having all these new
[1:11:16.900 --> 1:11:21.620]  disorders and they're going to claim that again the unvaccinated caused it when all the evidence
[1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:27.460]  and all the science shows it came from those that took the injections and that we're seeing
[1:11:27.460 --> 1:11:33.220]  marix disease in humans on a mass scale right well we're seeing we're seeing the disease take the
[1:11:33.220 --> 1:11:37.060]  same path as marix disease right because marix disease is in chickens that's what i'm saying
[1:11:37.060 --> 1:11:41.940]  is it's the same syndrome right just in humans give it a new name it's the same sort of uh yeah
[1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:46.340]  operation that's taking place and which by the way that that's the reason this is important a year
[1:11:46.340 --> 1:11:49.940]  and a half ago when we first covered it why are they obsessed with chickens why are they giving
[1:11:49.940 --> 1:11:55.220]  them the same shots it's causing super viruses to rise but now a year and a half later we have
[1:11:55.220 --> 1:12:01.060]  the proof in the pudding this ends the debate israeli study shows natural immunity 13 times
[1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:05.700]  more effective than vaccines everybody already knows that why is this surgeon general lying and
[1:12:05.700 --> 1:12:11.460]  saying it's not the case and then bomb shell study finds natural immunity superior to vaccination
[1:12:11.460 --> 1:12:17.300]  and then that ties in to the japanese saying ivermectin works 100 and then you also have
[1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:23.940]  the japanese recalling the moderna shot saying it's got liquid metal in it it's magnetic that's the
[1:12:23.940 --> 1:12:30.660]  government had a press conference and confirmed the shots magnetic how huge is that erison oh
[1:12:30.660 --> 1:12:35.620]  absolutely literally everything we've heard about coveted has been a lie the the social distancing
[1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:40.740]  they found out not true they did the study masks they found out don't don't pcr tests were alive
[1:12:40.740 --> 1:12:45.380]  pcr tests were alive the vaccines don't work from the very beginning we were trying to warn people
[1:12:45.380 --> 1:12:50.260]  about it and they were telling us we're racist for work your immunity doesn't work which is a lie
[1:12:50.260 --> 1:12:55.140]  ivermectin doesn't work a lie just sweden has the lowest death cases right now they never locked
[1:12:55.140 --> 1:13:00.100]  down once i mean people just can't it's like they don't understand temporal time they don't
[1:13:00.100 --> 1:13:05.140]  understand how to look at cause and effect it's literally by the way after you're gone and they're
[1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:09.700]  going to be covering a lot of this coming up next week when you host the morning show and do a great
[1:13:09.700 --> 1:13:14.900]  job american journal eight a m eleven a m i've got a whole stack out of india and out of sweden
[1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:18.660]  and other areas where the lowest vaccinated and basically no more cases they're fine
[1:13:19.700 --> 1:13:23.780]  israel's the highest vaccinated they're literally dying in mass same with iceland and uh and
[1:13:23.780 --> 1:13:27.940]  gibraltar i mean it's it's not speculation anymore we have the real world evidence
[1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:33.380]  it's just a matter of getting people to open up their eyes and really shed the fear the fear of
[1:13:33.380 --> 1:13:38.420]  asking these questions finding the right answers and realizing things are not as you're told and
[1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:42.260]  the people that you're trusting are not to be trusted and that's terrifying for people so they
[1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:48.020]  just reject it outright well that's right i mean let's take israel why would the jewish state take
[1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:52.820]  its own people and then give them deadly shots that don't protect them and attack and now go after
[1:13:52.820 --> 1:13:57.460]  their children because it's not jews that run israel it's the same globalist system that runs us
[1:13:58.020 --> 1:14:01.620]  i don't care if you're german i don't care if you're chinese i don't care if you're jewish
[1:14:01.620 --> 1:14:05.060]  i don't care if you're mexican i don't care what your religion is or even where you came from
[1:14:05.060 --> 1:14:11.460]  the globalist want you off the planet they want a depopulated planet they don't want you they think
[1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:16.900]  humans are obsolete and they're coming after everybody so we better come together and realize
[1:14:16.900 --> 1:14:24.100]  that the social contract has been broken and that we are under attack and that is a fact what are
[1:14:24.100 --> 1:14:28.580]  they going to do when they take the third booster as israel has already caused a bunch of deaths and
[1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:32.500]  it's already causing even worse mutations and then they say another shot and another shot
[1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:36.900]  and another shot harrison the ceo phyzer has said that we'll need one every year for the rest of
[1:14:36.900 --> 1:14:41.140]  time he said it'll be like flu shots from now on that that's a story that uh recently came out
[1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:45.460]  and then they asked i i think it was uh will linsky the cdc i think it was her who was being
[1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:49.300]  interviewed and they said how do you know the booster shot will work and she said it's just
[1:14:49.300 --> 1:14:53.620]  an it's just a hunch essentially i mean they have no studies to say that they actually did
[1:14:53.620 --> 1:14:57.060]  already said it all in animals because it's not designed to stop and it's designed to make you
[1:14:57.060 --> 1:15:01.860]  sick right and then give rise to a super virus so that you have to be under their control for
[1:15:01.860 --> 1:15:06.100]  the rest of your life it's satanic inversion that's literally what it is uh they it's not just wrong
[1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:12.580]  it is the inverse of what is right that's right they are they are making it impossible for a mother
[1:15:12.580 --> 1:15:17.060]  to breastfeed a mother to vaginally have a baby for us to have our own immune system the surgeon
[1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:24.980]  general says you do not have an immune system it doesn't work he's a liar he wants to enslave you
[1:15:24.980 --> 1:15:30.740]  at a basic level big pharma is involved in a corporate takeover of your body harrison smith

[1:20:29.220 --> 1:20:35.780]  well it was about seven months ago that we set on air the evidence pointed towards lieutenant
[1:20:35.780 --> 1:20:43.140]  michael bird as the shooter and then of course the family's got a lawsuit going against him so we
[1:20:43.140 --> 1:20:47.700]  didn't want to bring the name up when he was on with us a few weeks ago but erin babbitt is the
[1:20:47.700 --> 1:20:56.260]  patriot widower of ashley babbitt but i gotta tell you uh last night i watched tucker carlson when
[1:20:56.260 --> 1:21:00.900]  it was live and then i went back and watched the interview that michael bird gave and it
[1:21:00.900 --> 1:21:06.500]  didn't make me hate bird it made me feel pathetic as an american that there's people like this in
[1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:11.460]  this country and then we have a media that would put him up there to have him play a victim and
[1:21:11.460 --> 1:21:18.180]  whine and cry and and talk about what a hero he was and he saved countless lives shooting a five
[1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:23.940]  foot two woman instead of just going up and pushing people back through or saying stop if somebody just
[1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:29.060]  gave opposition they would have stopped i mean my god he just lays there and wait and then and
[1:21:29.060 --> 1:21:35.780]  then executes her so it's just next level like biden up there making jokes about what happened in
[1:21:35.780 --> 1:21:41.460]  afghanistan it's the same attitude the same thing and i don't know how erin babbitt who's at work
[1:21:41.460 --> 1:21:46.820]  right now popping in via phone can't even handle this he's a he's a better man than me uh i mean
[1:21:47.380 --> 1:21:52.580]  this this this is just so insulting that i don't know what to say at this point but we'll get his
[1:21:52.580 --> 1:21:58.900]  take on this but here's just some of the horrible stuff that uh bird uh had to say i mean the whole
[1:21:58.900 --> 1:22:05.940]  interview he acts like he's some damn hero or something here it is training and i spent
[1:22:06.580 --> 1:22:13.780]  countless years and preparing for such a moment you ultimately hope that moment never occurs
[1:22:14.420 --> 1:22:21.460]  but you prepare as best you can i know that day i saved countless lives i know members of congress
[1:22:21.460 --> 1:22:29.620]  as well as my fellow officers and staff were in jeopardy and in serious danger and that's my job
[1:22:30.180 --> 1:22:34.900]  okay so we had uh mr babbitt on a few weeks ago he was on skype so i didn't show the video
[1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:38.020]  today he's on phones he's not looking at it we're gonna roll the video
[1:22:38.020 --> 1:22:41.780]  they had to watch over and over again on that day but you got five or six people out in the hall
[1:22:41.780 --> 1:22:45.700]  you got a bunch of cops standing there you got her up against a window and he shoots her
[1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:54.420]  so the the idea that he was holding back like 300 uh you know in the movie 300 which actually
[1:22:54.420 --> 1:22:59.140]  you know happened in real life is just asinine erin thanks for coming on i'm this is gonna be
[1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:04.900]  a nightmare for you i would never have imagined that he wouldn't go on erin a police apologize
[1:23:04.900 --> 1:23:10.820]  and say he wish it would have gone differently but he's the moment instead he i mean what would
[1:23:10.820 --> 1:23:18.420]  you say he did this is this is just unbelievable thanks for having me back now it's um so that
[1:23:18.420 --> 1:23:24.100]  interview actually aired uh 7 30 my time um so when i went on with tucker and i was on newsmax
[1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:31.300]  with uh greg kelly i was actually being shown clips of this video for the first time um made
[1:23:31.300 --> 1:23:38.260]  my stomach turn made my skin crawl uh when you saw me on tucker i had actually heard a clip
[1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:44.500]  uh but i did not hear previously and it was uh i can't remember it verbatim but it was like
[1:23:44.500 --> 1:23:50.020]  would you have made the same decision knowing that she was unarmed and then i went live so
[1:23:50.020 --> 1:23:55.300]  when i said my agitation level was through the roof i i literally wanted to destroy that studio
[1:23:55.300 --> 1:24:02.260]  that i was in having to listen to this guy say that and knowing damn well that this interview
[1:24:02.260 --> 1:24:06.980]  has been probably set up for months now he's had these questions he's had scripted answers
[1:24:06.980 --> 1:24:11.540]  he's probably done the interview 30 times with a less to hold fill in the only thing we're missing
[1:24:11.540 --> 1:24:17.460]  was less to hold in his damn hand throughout this thing so it was it was a disgusting display of um
[1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:27.300]  yeah it was bad to watch exactly i am speechless here that he wouldn't say he was sorry he wouldn't
[1:24:27.300 --> 1:24:32.260]  say he wish it would have gone better he wouldn't give any condolences he said i'd do it again for
[1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:39.540]  trump i saved countless people and it's all a lie and it's all a fraud and they're up there
[1:24:39.540 --> 1:24:45.700]  like a man cold-bloodily shooting an unarmed woman is a beautiful wonderful thing this is just next
[1:24:45.700 --> 1:24:51.700]  level yeah it really is and to add even more to the show i mean i don't know if you guys caught
[1:24:51.700 --> 1:24:58.580]  wind up at your foot uh fenone the cop that was slamming his fist on the on the table and crying
[1:24:58.580 --> 1:25:03.540]  he was standing right off camera he was there with them and then his room was going around
[1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:08.500]  that the big guy saying everybody was calling him the n-word he was there with him too so there's a
[1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:15.140]  real weird connection going on now that you got these two guys two of the four that were on display
[1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:20.340]  you know with the scripted slot committee hearing and now two of them are standing there with bird
[1:25:20.340 --> 1:25:28.740]  you know letting them spew his garbage and you know watching this total kid club and interview well
[1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:33.860]  erin that's a key point there's hundreds of cameras thousands of cameras the capital thousands of
[1:25:33.860 --> 1:25:39.060]  hours of footage all these witnesses where's all the n-word video you know if they had that video
[1:25:39.060 --> 1:25:43.700]  we'd be seeing it wouldn't we yeah we would we absolutely would but you're not going to see it
[1:25:43.700 --> 1:25:49.140]  because it doesn't exist you know and there's there's so many cameras in there that i think i
[1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:52.900]  can't remember exactly what judicial watch was uh put the floor request in obviously it's going to
[1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:59.540]  get denied but if you have 14 000 hours of footage that's a lot of damn cameras man and there's
[1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:04.180]  reasons why they don't want to they don't want to give it a how because it's it's going to show the
[1:26:04.180 --> 1:26:08.740]  truth you know and eventually discovery is going to come around and we're going to get this out of
[1:26:08.740 --> 1:26:14.660]  them but they're going to fight tooth and nail to to keep it buried as long as we can well they've
[1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:20.500]  now arrested sam lontoya our long-time reporter who went in uh did nothing violent they've now
[1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:26.100]  indicted uh oh and shroyer our reporter who didn't even go into the capital they're trying to indict
[1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:31.380]  my wife now who was outside the capital uh it just seems like they're very very proud of themselves
[1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:36.020]  and want to say we're all terrorists and they've tried to imply and basically said on the news
[1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:40.660]  that your your wife was a terrorist but she wasn't she was a veteran she was a patriot she you know
[1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:45.620]  she went there to protest and she's dead now and this is the left that says burned down cities
[1:26:45.620 --> 1:26:49.540]  you know most will peaceful protests but that's not the case when it's your wife she didn't burn
[1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:55.300]  a damn thing down but she's dead what would you like to say now if you because last time you run
[1:26:55.300 --> 1:26:58.580]  you don't want to release his name at that time it's out now what would you say to
[1:26:58.580 --> 1:27:05.060]  lieutenant michael bird about the arrogant things he had to say i mean the one and only thing i
[1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:08.180]  really would have to say to them is i wish you would have left your gun in the bathroom on
[1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:14.660]  january 6th my wife would still be alive and of course you're mentioning the fact that a year
[1:27:14.660 --> 1:27:22.900]  before or so he'd left his gun in the bathroom already once yep sure it did he sure did he's
[1:27:22.900 --> 1:27:28.980]  got a clearly a marked history of mishandling his firearm and it even leads up to that day even
[1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:34.420]  before shooting my wife you know he he left his gun in the bathroom uh and he fast forwarded the
[1:27:34.420 --> 1:27:38.980]  6th when he's in the house chain but he's flagging everybody with that gun i think we came out with
[1:27:38.980 --> 1:27:45.460]  a picture that has you know a direct red line laser and there's like seven people that he flagged
[1:27:45.460 --> 1:27:50.740]  with that weapon inside the house chamber before he walked around and executed my wife this guy
[1:27:50.740 --> 1:27:54.660]  doesn't need to be carrying a gun and then you go a little bit further and he's saying that during
[1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:58.980]  that interview well i didn't know what was going on on the other side of that door i could i couldn't
[1:27:58.980 --> 1:28:04.820]  see i couldn't see you still shot though so you you could have hit one of your own officers you
[1:28:04.820 --> 1:28:09.460]  could have hit somebody else you shot my wife but you could have shot one of your own guys
[1:28:09.460 --> 1:28:15.540]  you know and i heard today uh that i haven't seen the video but apparently right after he shot
[1:28:15.540 --> 1:28:23.460]  ashley a cop with a long gun points it directly at him and says stop shooting no that's right that
[1:28:23.460 --> 1:28:27.780]  that all happened the police did not like it so because they're all sitting there like they were
[1:28:27.780 --> 1:28:32.740]  about to control the situation i you're at work if you've got to go understand if you do five more
[1:28:32.740 --> 1:28:36.660]  minutes i want to talk about the legal defense fund and and taking action against this monster
[1:28:36.660 --> 1:28:42.820]  because look i was i didn't like what the cop did but now that i saw this i really hate his cuts
[1:28:42.820 --> 1:28:48.020]  i mean this guy is bad news and you have national police associations saying it's a bad shoot
[1:28:48.020 --> 1:28:53.700]  and he's out he has the nerve to say he'd do it again we got that clip when we come back man wow
[1:28:53.700 --> 1:29:00.340]  why didn't you apologize we'll be right back stay with us attention radio listeners if you're
[1:29:00.340 --> 1:29:05.940]  concerned about the coming chaos after the november elections this will be an extremely
[1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:12.020]  important message here's why no matter what the outcome in november catastrophic social upheaval
[1:29:12.020 --> 1:29:18.100]  is a very real possibility here's why this is important listen we all know that silver and
[1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:23.860]  gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable
[1:29:23.860 --> 1:29:29.460]  currencies but did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship
[1:29:29.460 --> 1:29:35.380]  when americans put another store of value above even silver and gold it's true open pollinated
[1:29:35.380 --> 1:29:41.220]  seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead

[1:29:57.620 --> 1:30:04.740]  today so when i first started taking survival skills basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight
[1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:09.940]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard dr
[1:30:09.940 --> 1:30:13.780]  group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:18.420]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[1:30:18.420 --> 1:30:22.100]  have you know with the deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it
[1:30:22.100 --> 1:30:28.500]  and then in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you
[1:30:28.500 --> 1:30:33.860]  know i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple
[1:30:33.860 --> 1:30:38.500]  of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're

[1:33:21.940 --> 1:33:27.620]  welcome back to the yellow shown show after our guest leaves just got a ton of news and
[1:33:27.620 --> 1:33:33.700]  information to hit today we haven't gotten to yet but he is the winner of ashley babbitt who was
[1:33:33.700 --> 1:33:43.380]  executed on january 6 by federal capital police michael bird and like i said last night i saw
[1:33:43.380 --> 1:33:47.140]  carlson first i hadn't seen the bird thing yet because it happened about the same time i saw it
[1:33:47.140 --> 1:33:55.940]  later and i was watching it and i was thinking about mr babbitt because i've never seen somebody
[1:33:55.940 --> 1:34:01.540]  rub it in like this and the media hold his hand and and and call himself a victim and
[1:34:01.540 --> 1:34:06.500]  let him talk about how oh he's getting threats and all this a lot of nerve and here's the photo
[1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:13.300]  that mr babbitt was talking about if you're a tv viewer this is a shot of lieutenant michael bird
[1:34:13.300 --> 1:34:20.500]  when he's in the gallery aiming his gun at the police and members of congress and that's why yes
[1:34:20.500 --> 1:34:25.700]  they also telling the police to come up the window and say put your damn gun down they shot ashley
[1:34:25.700 --> 1:34:34.260]  because they know he's obviously a trigger happy individual and so here's another clip of him saying
[1:34:34.260 --> 1:34:38.580]  oh i would do this for trump well i don't think trump wants you to shoot an unarmed woman for him
[1:34:38.580 --> 1:34:45.060]  mr tough guy i mean my god imagine if this would have been a white cop shooting a black
[1:34:45.060 --> 1:34:50.180]  unarmed woman the cities would be burning in america but because she's a conservative white
[1:34:50.180 --> 1:34:54.820]  woman and you're a black guy it's supposedly okay and that's the political correctness in this country
[1:34:56.180 --> 1:35:01.780]  let's go ahead and play the clip here it is i have been yelling and screaming as loud as i was
[1:35:01.780 --> 1:35:09.060]  please stop get back get back stop you're ultimately hoping that your commands will be complied with
[1:35:09.940 --> 1:35:16.660]  and unfortunately they were not former president trump has has talked about you and this in this
[1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:24.660]  incident he says she was murdered what does it feel like to hear that from a former president
[1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:32.180]  well it's disheartening if he was in the room or anywhere and i'm responsible for him
[1:35:32.900 --> 1:35:37.380]  i was prepared to do the same thing for him and his family would you have his back today if you
[1:35:37.380 --> 1:35:45.380]  were so assigned i sure would because it's my job your job to shoot an unarmed woman
[1:35:46.340 --> 1:35:51.460]  from a hiding position i mean this isn't like the cops i've known in my life okay a woman's
[1:35:51.460 --> 1:35:56.740]  coming through a door whatever uh you know stuff's out emotions are high go up and say get back
[1:35:56.740 --> 1:36:03.540]  yell at them or or or hit them but no you you sit there and you shoot them and you execute them and
[1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:11.860]  then you talk about how you're a hero i i noticed erin again widower of ashley babbitt twitter at
[1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:18.100]  for ashley give send go.com sports class justice for ashley so you guys can sue these monsters
[1:36:18.100 --> 1:36:22.180]  you need to raise a lot more money now there's no doubt this guy deserves to be sued into oblivion
[1:36:23.380 --> 1:36:27.700]  i saw you got really pissed also once you found out what he was saying about him whining and
[1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:32.180]  complaining about how he's a victim so so what else do you like to impart to the viewers and
[1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:36.500]  listeners about this and where this is going because if they can execute a veteran an unarmed
[1:36:36.500 --> 1:36:43.460]  woman in america and make the man that did it a hero none of us are safe is my point yeah i i have
[1:36:43.460 --> 1:36:51.140]  a very hard time i will never be able to find a single ounce of sympathy for him you know claiming
[1:36:51.140 --> 1:36:55.780]  to be a victim or say you know that people are saying bad things to him or he's getting death
[1:36:55.780 --> 1:37:01.940]  threats i mean i said i said it before i i started receiving death threats january 7th
[1:37:01.940 --> 1:37:07.460]  on my wife talking about how the tattoo on my chest is going to make a great target you know
[1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:12.260]  a hate mail get pictures of my wife that looked like it was a memorial card i'd open it up and
[1:37:12.260 --> 1:37:17.860]  it's a picture of her dead on the floor there so and the only thing i did on january 6th was
[1:37:17.860 --> 1:37:22.980]  you know become a widower i wasn't there i had nothing to do with any of this so for me to feel
[1:37:22.980 --> 1:37:28.020]  want to try to feel bad about him getting death threats like you got to suck it up but it's not
[1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:33.700]  taking him on the chin so yeah we have the legal fund going i need to thank you personally while
[1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:37.140]  they have the opportunity because you gave it a great bump the last time i was on you and your
[1:37:37.140 --> 1:37:42.820]  viewers your viewers are amazing um we're we're we're pushing forward obviously it's been a busy
[1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:50.260]  couple days and a lot of people are coming out to um to help us and i think the the real story is
[1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:56.180]  is coming out now that we've been out this whole time the last seven eight months you know screaming
[1:37:56.180 --> 1:38:00.980]  for justice for ashley and putting the work in and putting the time in for the my wife deserves
[1:38:00.980 --> 1:38:06.420]  and now this clown just comes on one day and now america gets to see what's really going on so i
[1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:11.700]  think we're going to have a big shift in the pie here i agree with you how tone death is he
[1:38:12.420 --> 1:38:17.540]  an NBC to do this i mean he should have said hey i felt threatened it was emotional but i
[1:38:17.540 --> 1:38:21.940]  think i did my job but i'm at least sorry to the family and i wish it would have gone better
[1:38:21.940 --> 1:38:29.140]  instead he says i'd do it again i mean i mean who is advising this guy yeah i don't know i mean
[1:38:29.140 --> 1:38:37.780]  you can look up as the terminal i think he's kind of uh colorful past um yeah it's like i said i i
[1:38:37.780 --> 1:38:42.740]  don't have any sympathy i truly believe this is all orchestrated and you know my thoughts on why
[1:38:42.740 --> 1:38:46.900]  they decided to put him out is because for the last eight months it's just been also out there
[1:38:46.900 --> 1:38:51.780]  talking and the the common question has always been who killed ashley david who killed ashley
[1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:56.900]  david all the speculation is coming out but it's always who killed ashley david so their side must
[1:38:56.900 --> 1:39:02.820]  now think you know what let's put him out there handle this you know interview with with kid gloves
[1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:06.340]  put him up there with lester let me make him feel comfortable bring two of his friends there with

[1:39:10.980 --> 1:39:15.460]  david but i think it's going to backfire a big time in their face because it was it was hard it was
[1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:20.980]  terrible it was an awful i agree with you in closing nobody can really speak for the dead but your
[1:39:20.980 --> 1:39:26.660]  wife lives on and god's real her spirit's alive and and and she lives on today but if anybody
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:32.820]  can speak for somebody it's it's somebody's husband or or wife a spouse what do you think from heaven
[1:39:33.620 --> 1:39:38.660]  she thinks right now or if she was alive here today what would ashley david your great wife
[1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:42.980]  think about what happened that day and where america is and where this is all going what would she
[1:39:42.980 --> 1:39:49.540]  say right now oh she would she'd be absolutely just modified with the direction that this country's

[1:44:16.740 --> 1:44:21.540]  even though it seems like the globalists are winning the truth is they've had to come out
[1:44:21.540 --> 1:44:28.020]  the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing we have forced them out in the

[1:44:57.700 --> 1:45:05.300]  surrender humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet but the big corporations for a hundred
[1:45:05.300 --> 1:45:09.380]  years have told us that humans are bad and evil and a pest wants on the earth so that we begin to
[1:45:09.380 --> 1:45:14.340]  believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force and let the eugenics-based globalists
[1:45:14.340 --> 1:45:19.620]  take control of the planet if you go to claus schwaab the evadabas group's own wikipedia page
[1:45:19.620 --> 1:45:25.460]  he brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide
[1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:31.620]  to set up a corporate dictatorship under the un they admit all of this they plan the lockdowns
[1:45:31.620 --> 1:45:37.780]  they release the viruses they think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources
[1:45:37.780 --> 1:45:43.300]  so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives that's how i was able to predict

[1:47:05.300 --> 1:47:14.740]  so
[1:47:14.740 --> 1:47:30.180]  so
[1:47:37.380 --> 1:47:43.620]  i knew that the new world order was real but i really thought we could stop it i really thought
[1:47:43.620 --> 1:47:51.540]  humanity would turn it around and yeah we uh we've certainly exposed it we've we've gotten a
[1:47:51.540 --> 1:47:58.580]  position to fight it but they're going ahead with it because evil has such an incredibly
[1:47:59.620 --> 1:48:02.420]  huge appetite for blood and sweat and tears
[1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:10.740]  so i've told the crew our main mission is to magnify all these incredible
[1:48:10.740 --> 1:48:18.340]  scientists phyrologists medical doctors mds phd's on the show and the crew's been doing a really good
[1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:26.660]  job somebody wanted to get for a while dr peter r bergen who gave that incredible speech
[1:48:26.660 --> 1:48:39.780]  bergen up in uh mount vernin in fact you guys cue that up for me is going to be coming on the
[1:48:39.780 --> 1:48:50.180]  show here today and we will continue on into the fourth hour as well i am going to come back
[1:48:50.180 --> 1:48:57.460]  tomorrow and tape a two or three hour special show that'll air sometime tomorrow evening
[1:48:57.460 --> 1:49:03.380]  at man dot video and i really appreciate the listeners taking action and some of those saturday
[1:49:03.380 --> 1:49:09.220]  shows get two million viewers most of them get about a million and i i count that as very special
[1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:15.140]  it should be 50 million if we wanted to really save things but you're spreading it you're sharing it
[1:49:15.140 --> 1:49:19.940]  you've got to get those you give it to to share it even more
[1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:28.900]  because it's one thing say share this and then somebody shares it they got to tell the next
[1:49:28.900 --> 1:49:33.060]  person to share it and they got to tell them to share it and they got to tell them to share it
[1:49:33.060 --> 1:49:36.980]  and i know i'm stating the obvious here but everybody knows that archetypal thing of
[1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:43.540]  hey passing on this is a scam and you tell the next person you tell the next person
[1:49:43.540 --> 1:49:47.700]  that's how humans communicate it's how we override this information
[1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:56.580]  but i really need everybody's help right now more than ever because info wars is the zeitgeist
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:02.820]  and i know god built this operation through you and through the crew and so we're meant to be
[1:50:02.820 --> 1:50:08.900]  on air at this historical point right now but the only way
[1:50:08.900 --> 1:50:13.860]  way this incredible information gets out to people
[1:50:16.180 --> 1:50:22.740]  is if you share it and i know i'm stating an incredibly obvious thing here right now but
[1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:30.420]  if if folks don't get that we have no hope i mean the minute you really grasp that the
[1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:34.180]  minute you really understand that it's over for the new world order
[1:50:34.180 --> 1:50:40.180]  now i'm going to play a clip here because i need to talk to the crew here
[1:50:41.140 --> 1:50:43.460]  and then we're going to figure out what's going on with the guests coming up but
[1:50:48.100 --> 1:50:51.220]  i've got some really important things that need to be done here on air today we're going to do it
[1:50:51.220 --> 1:51:07.300]  as best we can a lot of things here to cover let's share clip 27 that'll give me some time
[1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:22.500]  to get ready here is uh clip 27 for you fizer will pay 2.3 billion dollars in civil and criminal
[1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:30.500]  fines the criminal fine nearly 1.2 billion dollars is the single largest fine in u.s history the u.s
[1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:36.180]  government will also supervise fizer's behavior for the next five years 17-year-old sham su
[1:51:36.180 --> 1:51:42.900]  undergoes a dna test to prove he's a victim of a failed drug trial by the pharmaceutical company
[1:51:42.900 --> 1:51:50.020]  fizer that happened 15 years ago in carno state nigeria 11 children were killed and several more
[1:51:50.020 --> 1:51:56.900]  injured when fizer tested out a drug called troven on 200 children the drug was supposed to treat a
[1:51:56.900 --> 1:52:04.180]  deadly regional outbreak of meningitis fizer agreed to pay 75 million dollars in compensation
[1:52:04.180 --> 1:52:12.580]  in 2009 have you taken the vaccine sir no i haven't taken it yet and we are having an ethical
[1:52:12.580 --> 1:52:17.780]  committee dealing with the question of who is getting it so they're gonna plan on getting FDA
[1:52:17.780 --> 1:52:22.260]  approval for the covid vaccine next week so they can try to push all these mandates on everybody
[1:52:22.260 --> 1:52:25.700]  because they're gonna tell you how safe and effective it is well guess how they did it
[1:52:25.700 --> 1:52:32.100]  they got a woman named janet woodcock who is the chief for the center of drug evaluation research
[1:52:32.100 --> 1:52:37.860]  and they put her as the acting head of the FDA to give her the approval status and this woman
[1:52:37.860 --> 1:52:44.660]  is personally responsible for approving both oxy cotton which is causing a freaking epidemic
[1:52:44.660 --> 1:52:50.500]  and fentanyl the two most dangerous drugs on the market today that got approved by this woman
[1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:56.100]  janet woodcock who's now going to be approving our covid vaccines so they can push everybody
[1:52:56.100 --> 1:53:02.900]  with mandates this would tip businesses and colleges to consider mandating the vaccine once
[1:53:02.900 --> 1:53:07.460]  it gets full approval would you urge them to do that and i think it's a very reasonable thing to do
[1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:15.700]  the FDA has now granted full approval of the fizer covid 19 vaccine making it the first
[1:53:15.700 --> 1:53:22.020]  covid vaccine to transition from emergency authorization status to full FDA approval
[1:53:22.020 --> 1:53:27.300]  this is a game-changing moment we've been waiting for this for a long time to have the full approval
[1:53:27.300 --> 1:53:33.460]  vaccine we now have it this helps us move forward and we're moving forward with our schools with
[1:53:33.460 --> 1:53:40.100]  this new vaccine mandate after a strict process the FDA is reaffirmed it's finding that the fizer
[1:53:40.100 --> 1:53:46.740]  covid 19 vaccine is safe and effective and the FDA has given its full and final approval
[1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:53.140]  so let me say this uh loudly and clearly if you have if you're one of the millions of
[1:53:53.140 --> 1:54:00.820]  americans all right folks we have a very get the shot we have a very special guest joining us coming
[1:54:00.820 --> 1:54:09.140]  up in the third hour that is just a few minutes away dr. peter bergen and his bio was so long
[1:54:09.140 --> 1:54:14.580]  and so lengthy and so prestigious there won't be time for me to go over at all when he comes on
[1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:21.300]  with us but believe me he's talking about global predators and global government and how to counter
[1:54:21.300 --> 1:54:26.100]  that you want to see the full report that you were just witnessing it's in the john bound section
[1:54:26.820 --> 1:54:37.300]  of band dot video covet tyranny meets resistance worldwide a very very important report indeed
[1:54:37.300 --> 1:54:44.980]  this is this is the globalist big move and and when you see the type of stuff that is happening
[1:54:45.860 --> 1:54:53.540]  in australia or in afghanistan all of that is just to train you to accept literal hell on earth
[1:54:54.260 --> 1:55:02.980]  not just here in america but all over the planet and i know it's really hard for people to be able
[1:55:02.980 --> 1:55:07.780]  to deal with this it's hard for me to deal with this i am processing all this just like you are
[1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:13.380]  there's there's no doubt they're infecting us with things that are designed to slowly kill us
[1:55:14.020 --> 1:55:18.340]  there's there's there's there's there's no doubt we are in the middle of world war four
[1:55:19.140 --> 1:55:24.340]  the world war three again was the cold war and that was a light war compared to the war that we
[1:55:24.340 --> 1:55:31.220]  are in right now separately i don't know what i need to say or do to listeners to let them realize
[1:55:31.220 --> 1:55:37.700]  how important they are everything info wars is done in the fight and and and the fact that our
[1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:45.140]  talking points are now the main dominant resistance worldwide the globalist is because of your support
[1:55:46.580 --> 1:55:54.900]  so i cannot stress enough to listeners how important it is for you to continue to spread
[1:55:54.900 --> 1:55:59.220]  the word about the live links at band dot video and info wars dot com and to continue to pray for
[1:55:59.220 --> 1:56:03.940]  the show and to continue to financially support us i i got a call yesterday from our big food

[1:58:15.460 --> 1:58:21.380]  i wanted to just quote from the bible jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is
[1:58:21.380 --> 1:58:29.380]  matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall
[1:58:29.380 --> 1:58:36.580]  be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another
[1:58:36.580 --> 1:58:41.780]  and shall hate one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because god's name

[1:59:47.420 --> 1:59:49.420]  That's infowars.store.com.
[1:59:49.420 --> 1:59:55.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:24.420]  Where did the sudden fear of germs come from in this country?
[2:00:24.420 --> 2:00:25.420]  Have you noticed this?
[2:00:25.420 --> 2:00:29.420]  The media constantly running stories about all the latest infections.
[2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:32.420]  Salmonella, E. coli, hand to virus, bird flu.
[2:00:32.420 --> 2:00:34.420]  And Americans are, they panic easily.
[2:00:34.420 --> 2:00:37.420]  So now everybody's running around scrubbing this and spraying that
[2:00:37.420 --> 2:00:40.420]  and overcooking their food and repeatedly washing their hands
[2:00:40.420 --> 2:00:43.420]  trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[2:00:43.420 --> 2:00:46.420]  It's ridiculous and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[2:00:46.420 --> 2:00:50.420]  Fear of germs, why these f***ing f***ies?
[2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:53.420]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure?
[2:00:53.420 --> 2:00:55.420]  Take a f***ing chance, will ya?
[2:00:55.420 --> 2:00:59.420]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[2:00:59.420 --> 2:01:01.420]  It's for killing germs.
[2:01:01.420 --> 2:01:02.420]  But it needs practice.
[2:01:02.420 --> 2:01:05.420]  It needs germs to practice on.
[2:01:05.420 --> 2:01:08.420]  So, so listen.
[2:01:08.420 --> 2:01:11.420]  So listen.
[2:01:11.420 --> 2:01:14.420]  If you kill all the germs around you
[2:01:14.420 --> 2:01:16.420]  and live a completely sterile life,
[2:01:16.420 --> 2:01:19.420]  then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[2:01:19.420 --> 2:01:21.420]  And never mind ordinary germs,
[2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:23.420]  what are you going to do when some super virus comes along
[2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:27.420]  that turns your vital organs into liquid s***?
[2:01:27.420 --> 2:01:28.420]  I'll tell you what you're going to do.
[2:01:28.420 --> 2:01:30.420]  You're going to get sick, you're going to die,
[2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.420]  and you're going to deserve it because you're f***ing weak
[2:01:32.420 --> 2:01:35.420]  and you got a f***ing weak immune system.
[2:01:40.420 --> 2:01:43.420]  Let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[2:01:43.420 --> 2:01:46.420]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s,
[2:01:46.420 --> 2:01:48.420]  we swam in the Hudson River,
[2:01:48.420 --> 2:01:51.420]  and it was filled with raw sewage, okay?
[2:01:51.420 --> 2:01:56.420]  We swam in raw sewage, you know, to cool off.
[2:01:57.420 --> 2:02:00.420]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[2:02:00.420 --> 2:02:02.420]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[2:02:02.420 --> 2:02:03.420]  But you know something?
[2:02:03.420 --> 2:02:05.420]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[2:02:05.420 --> 2:02:06.420]  No one ever.
[2:02:06.420 --> 2:02:07.420]  You know why?
[2:02:07.420 --> 2:02:10.420]  Because we swam in raw sewage.
[2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:13.420]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[2:02:13.420 --> 2:02:15.420]  The polio never had a prayer.
[2:02:15.420 --> 2:02:18.420]  We were tempered in raw s***.
[2:02:28.420 --> 2:02:31.420]  What George Carlin said is based in science, in fact,
[2:02:31.420 --> 2:02:33.420]  and everybody knew 30 years ago the truth.
[2:02:33.420 --> 2:02:35.420]  Thousands of studies were already out then
[2:02:35.420 --> 2:02:38.420]  that if you are a shut-in and aren't around germs,
[2:02:38.420 --> 2:02:41.420]  especially as a child, you don't develop an immune system
[2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:43.420]  like the boy that had to live in a bubble.
[2:02:43.420 --> 2:02:45.420]  But your body's got to have the building blocks
[2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:46.420]  for its immune system.
[2:02:46.420 --> 2:02:48.420]  The number one building block is Vitamin D3.
[2:02:48.420 --> 2:02:50.420]  We've got the best at m4store.com.

[2:02:59.420 --> 2:03:01.420]  Thanks to you kids.
[2:03:01.420 --> 2:03:03.420]  We now know the virus is a hoax.
[2:03:03.420 --> 2:03:05.420]  They included flu, pneumonia,
[2:03:05.420 --> 2:03:07.420]  and other infections to boost the numbers.
[2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:09.420]  Let's find out who was really behind it all.
[2:03:09.420 --> 2:03:13.420]  Like President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[2:03:15.420 --> 2:03:17.420]  She's she pink?
[2:03:18.420 --> 2:03:19.420]  Dr. Fauci.
[2:03:19.420 --> 2:03:22.420]  Like I thought doctors were supposed to help people,
[2:03:22.420 --> 2:03:23.420]  not scare them.
[2:03:24.420 --> 2:03:26.420]  Microsoft's Bill Gates.
[2:03:26.420 --> 2:03:30.420]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher
[2:03:30.420 --> 2:03:32.420]  who wants to reduce the world's population.
[2:03:32.420 --> 2:03:35.420]  I get it, so Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone
[2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:38.420]  after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak.
[2:03:38.420 --> 2:03:39.420]  That's diabolical.
[2:03:39.420 --> 2:03:41.420]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[2:03:41.420 --> 2:03:42.420]  Don't worry, kids.
[2:03:42.420 --> 2:03:46.420]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[2:03:46.420 --> 2:03:49.420]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while
[2:03:49.420 --> 2:03:51.420]  in the big house.
[2:03:51.420 --> 2:03:52.420]  Yeah.
[2:03:53.420 --> 2:03:55.420]  Better than a rock round at home.
[2:03:58.420 --> 2:04:01.420]  The answer to 1984
[2:04:01.420 --> 2:04:04.420]  is 1776.
[2:04:12.420 --> 2:04:14.420]  Infowars has been banned.
[2:04:16.420 --> 2:04:17.420]  Arrested.

[2:04:23.420 --> 2:04:25.420]  Because we are effective.
[2:04:26.420 --> 2:04:28.420]  The great awakening is here.

[2:06:02.420 --> 2:06:05.420]  Dr. Peter Briggan needs no introduction.
[2:06:05.420 --> 2:06:07.420]  I'm very honored to have him.
[2:06:07.420 --> 2:06:14.420]  He's been called the voice of good psychiatry basically.
[2:06:14.420 --> 2:06:16.420]  I'm not going to go over his giant bio here,
[2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:19.420]  but he's Harvard-trained psychiatrist, former consultant.
[2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:24.420]  He's been called the voice of good psychiatry basically.
[2:06:24.420 --> 2:06:26.420]  I'm not going to go over his giant bio here,
[2:06:26.420 --> 2:06:31.420]  but he's Harvard-trained psychiatrist, former consultant to the NIMH.
[2:06:31.420 --> 2:06:34.420]  He's been called the conscience of psychiatry for as many decades.
[2:06:34.420 --> 2:06:37.420]  A successful average reform, the mental health field.
[2:06:37.420 --> 2:06:42.420]  And now he's been turning his attention towards the anti misuse of science
[2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:44.420]  surrounding COVID-19.
[2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:49.420]  Briggan.com, B-R-E-G-G-I-N.com.
[2:06:49.420 --> 2:06:52.420]  And so, Doctor, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:06:52.420 --> 2:06:57.420]  You want to get into CEPI and Bill Gates and this whole agenda
[2:06:57.420 --> 2:06:59.420]  and what's really going on.
[2:06:59.420 --> 2:07:01.420]  So you're really one of the top experts out there.
[2:07:01.420 --> 2:07:03.420]  We're very blessed to have you.
[2:07:03.420 --> 2:07:06.420]  We appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[2:07:06.420 --> 2:07:11.420]  Alex, my wife and I, Ginger, who wrote the book together,
[2:07:11.420 --> 2:07:13.420]  we're just so glad to be here.
[2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:15.420]  Often when I'd get up in the morning,
[2:07:15.420 --> 2:07:17.420]  she'd already been listening to your show
[2:07:17.420 --> 2:07:21.420]  and she describes it as her really, real deep cup of coffee
[2:07:21.420 --> 2:07:25.420]  and GPT briefing me on what you'd been saying.
[2:07:25.420 --> 2:07:27.420]  So you matter a lot to us.
[2:07:27.420 --> 2:07:31.420]  We feel that you've just been far ahead of the curve
[2:07:31.420 --> 2:07:34.420]  on these issues and you're a godsend.
[2:07:34.420 --> 2:07:36.420]  Say it outright.
[2:07:36.420 --> 2:07:38.420]  Well, sir, I've been watching a lot of your interviews
[2:07:38.420 --> 2:07:39.420]  and you're a godsend as well.
[2:07:39.420 --> 2:07:40.420]  So God bless you.
[2:07:40.420 --> 2:07:41.420]  Thanks for being here.
[2:07:41.420 --> 2:07:43.420]  Please tell us a big picture.
[2:07:43.420 --> 2:07:45.420]  I mean, what's happening?
[2:07:45.420 --> 2:07:47.420]  Well, we really have breaking news
[2:07:47.420 --> 2:07:50.420]  that we're breaking on your station for the first time.
[2:07:50.420 --> 2:07:55.420]  And we have found what is the business plan
[2:07:55.420 --> 2:08:03.420]  of the predators for COVID-19 developed in 2016,
[2:08:03.420 --> 2:08:06.420]  published among themselves.
[2:08:06.420 --> 2:08:08.420]  We've sent you a copy.
[2:08:08.420 --> 2:08:12.420]  It's the document with a big orange picture of an injection
[2:08:12.420 --> 2:08:14.420]  into a shoulder on the cover.
[2:08:14.420 --> 2:08:18.420]  And it's an organization that's received very little attention
[2:08:18.420 --> 2:08:21.420]  founded by Bill Gates.
[2:08:21.420 --> 2:08:23.420]  And it's CEPI CEPI.
[2:08:23.420 --> 2:08:29.420]  And the official name is Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness.
[2:08:29.420 --> 2:08:34.420]  We first tracked this with later documents.
[2:08:34.420 --> 2:08:38.420]  And now we have the initial business plan.
[2:08:38.420 --> 2:08:40.420]  And it really...
[2:08:40.420 --> 2:08:49.420]  Skype's an incredible technology,
[2:08:49.420 --> 2:08:51.420]  but occasionally it gives us a problem.
[2:08:51.420 --> 2:08:54.420]  And here he is laying out the business plan
[2:08:54.420 --> 2:08:57.420]  for the takeover we're seeing right now.
[2:08:57.420 --> 2:09:00.420]  And so we'll be going back to our guest,
[2:09:00.420 --> 2:09:04.420]  Dr. Peter Brigham, as soon as he's able to reconnect to us
[2:09:04.420 --> 2:09:05.420]  and we have to.
[2:09:05.420 --> 2:09:08.420]  We'll go over the phone here today.
[2:09:08.420 --> 2:09:12.420]  Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
[2:09:12.420 --> 2:09:13.420]  Doc, you were just...
[2:09:13.420 --> 2:09:14.420]  You only cut out for a few seconds.
[2:09:14.420 --> 2:09:19.420]  You were saying we've got the business plan from 2016.
[2:09:19.420 --> 2:09:21.420]  Please continue.
[2:09:21.420 --> 2:09:22.420]  All right.
[2:09:22.420 --> 2:09:24.420]  The plan has begun by, guess who?
[2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:26.420]  Bill Gates.
[2:09:26.420 --> 2:09:28.420]  You know, I thought, ah, come on.
[2:09:28.420 --> 2:09:30.420]  It isn't going to be so much about Bill Gates.
[2:09:30.420 --> 2:09:32.420]  Well, it is a lot about Bill Gates.
[2:09:32.420 --> 2:09:37.420]  In 2015 and 16, Bill Gates got together with, guess who?
[2:09:37.420 --> 2:09:41.420]  Klaus Schwab, who is the great reset maven,
[2:09:41.420 --> 2:09:43.420]  you know, the so-called intellectual
[2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:45.420]  of the global predators.
[2:09:45.420 --> 2:09:50.420]  And together they announced in 2017
[2:09:50.420 --> 2:09:54.420]  at Schwab's big meeting, the World Economic Forum,
[2:09:54.420 --> 2:09:57.420]  that they were setting up this organization.
[2:09:57.420 --> 2:10:00.420]  Its purpose was going to be to bring together
[2:10:00.420 --> 2:10:02.420]  the governments of the world,
[2:10:02.420 --> 2:10:05.420]  the industries of the world,
[2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:10.420]  the NGOs of the world, big philanthropic organizations.
[2:10:10.420 --> 2:10:13.420]  But the real connection is between Bill Gates,
[2:10:13.420 --> 2:10:17.420]  Klaus Schwab, and the World Health Organization.
[2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:18.420]  Who?
[2:10:18.420 --> 2:10:23.420]  And you wonder why who was so tight with Fauci,
[2:10:23.420 --> 2:10:25.420]  who's basically small fry.
[2:10:25.420 --> 2:10:28.420]  Fauci, by the way, was on Bill Gates's,
[2:10:28.420 --> 2:10:32.420]  and still is, on his very small vaccine,
[2:10:32.420 --> 2:10:37.420]  his elite vaccine committee, advisory committee.
[2:10:37.420 --> 2:10:39.420]  So you've got Fauci in there way, way back,
[2:10:39.420 --> 2:10:42.420]  although he does not appear in the business plan.
[2:10:42.420 --> 2:10:45.420]  Now, one of the stunning things about the business plan
[2:10:45.420 --> 2:10:50.420]  is it was actually making a memoranda of understanding.
[2:10:50.420 --> 2:10:52.420]  That's a legal document.
[2:10:52.420 --> 2:10:54.420]  It isn't final in law,
[2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:58.420]  but it's the understanding of how we're going to proceed
[2:10:58.420 --> 2:10:59.420]  in the future.
[2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:02.420]  And Bill Gates developed this understanding,
[2:11:02.420 --> 2:11:05.420]  which we have now fully documented,
[2:11:05.420 --> 2:11:07.420]  with the World Health Organization,
[2:11:07.420 --> 2:11:10.420]  complete, literally, with this legal agreement
[2:11:10.420 --> 2:11:14.420]  that they would basically divide up the world
[2:11:14.420 --> 2:11:17.420]  once they had a pandemic to do it with.
[2:11:17.420 --> 2:11:19.420]  Four years ahead of time.
[2:11:19.420 --> 2:11:23.420]  And that one of the big deals was that
[2:11:23.420 --> 2:11:25.420]  there would be a no-loss policy
[2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:27.420]  for the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:11:27.420 --> 2:11:30.420]  That's one of the words they used in their documents,
[2:11:30.420 --> 2:11:33.420]  no-loss for the pharmaceutical industry,
[2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:35.420]  meaning that they'd get the governments
[2:11:35.420 --> 2:11:37.420]  and the philanthropic organizations,
[2:11:37.420 --> 2:11:40.420]  mainly as it turns out to be the U.S. government,
[2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:45.420]  us taxpayers, to fund not only their indirect costs,
[2:11:45.420 --> 2:11:47.420]  but their indirect costs
[2:11:47.420 --> 2:11:50.420]  for creating the vaccine platforms
[2:11:50.420 --> 2:11:55.420]  for then pushing through the viruses.
[2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:58.420]  They worked with the FDA early on,
[2:11:58.420 --> 2:12:00.420]  and some of the co-founders,
[2:12:00.420 --> 2:12:03.420]  Bill Gates and Fauci Seppi,
[2:12:03.420 --> 2:12:05.420]  Bill Gates and Fauci co-founders,
[2:12:05.420 --> 2:12:10.420]  NIH, FDA, and BARDA.
[2:12:10.420 --> 2:12:13.420]  Now, BARDA is the organization
[2:12:13.420 --> 2:12:16.420]  that was run by Rick Bright.
[2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:20.420]  Rick Bright is a tremendously important villain.
[2:12:20.420 --> 2:12:22.420]  I think he is an apt,
[2:12:22.420 --> 2:12:27.420]  literally apt place to be looking for legal cases,
[2:12:27.420 --> 2:12:32.420]  for doing research, deep dives.
[2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:37.420]  Bright was the individual who stopped Trump
[2:12:37.420 --> 2:12:40.420]  from releasing the huge stores
[2:12:40.420 --> 2:12:43.420]  that we had in America of hydroxychloroquine.
[2:12:43.420 --> 2:12:48.420]  And Bright was in on the formation of Seppi.
[2:12:48.420 --> 2:12:50.420]  He is the major figure,
[2:12:50.420 --> 2:12:52.420]  clearly now, from all the documents
[2:12:52.420 --> 2:12:55.420]  we've gotten now on Seppi.
[2:12:55.420 --> 2:13:00.420]  And Bright actually reversed Trump's policy
[2:13:00.420 --> 2:13:02.420]  with a few slights of hand.
[2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:06.420]  So instead of making hydroxychloroquine
[2:13:06.420 --> 2:13:07.420]  available to the public,
[2:13:07.420 --> 2:13:10.420]  which would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives,
[2:13:10.420 --> 2:13:12.420]  millions all over the world
[2:13:12.420 --> 2:13:17.420]  because people follow our example.
[2:13:17.420 --> 2:13:22.420]  Because hydroxychloroquine was part of
[2:13:22.420 --> 2:13:27.420]  the basic treatment for early COVID at home.
[2:13:27.420 --> 2:13:29.420]  And when you use it in combination
[2:13:29.420 --> 2:13:32.420]  with other medications, all cheap,
[2:13:32.420 --> 2:13:34.420]  all extremely safe,
[2:13:34.420 --> 2:13:38.420]  government approved, I mean, FDA approved
[2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:43.420]  hydroxychloroquine for malaria and other purposes.
[2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:46.420]  This drug was relatively harmless.
[2:13:46.420 --> 2:13:48.420]  I'm really an expert in adverse drug effects.
[2:13:48.420 --> 2:13:52.420]  I researched a very, very, very safe drug.
[2:13:52.420 --> 2:13:54.420]  And they found that this drug
[2:13:54.420 --> 2:13:56.420]  in controlled clinical trials,
[2:13:56.420 --> 2:13:59.420]  really mostly though looking just at large groups
[2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:01.420]  and studying the effects,
[2:14:01.420 --> 2:14:07.420]  reduced hospitalization by 85%
[2:14:07.420 --> 2:14:10.420]  if you use this treatment regimen at home
[2:14:10.420 --> 2:14:14.420]  and reduced deaths by 75%.
[2:14:14.420 --> 2:14:19.420]  Now we already start with a disease, COVID-19,
[2:14:19.420 --> 2:14:21.420]  that is no worse than the flu.
[2:14:21.420 --> 2:14:25.420]  And in many ways is much less harmful
[2:14:25.420 --> 2:14:28.420]  because it doesn't kill children.
[2:14:28.420 --> 2:14:31.420]  So you start with a drug that doesn't do
[2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:34.420]  deep harm to children very, very rarely.
[2:14:34.420 --> 2:14:38.420]  And you have older people.
[2:14:38.420 --> 2:14:40.420]  And it's very simple to not...
[2:14:40.420 --> 2:14:43.420]  So this really shows the predatory nature
[2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:46.420]  that they're trying to block vitamin D in the news,
[2:14:46.420 --> 2:14:48.420]  vitamin C, hydroxychloroquine.
[2:14:48.420 --> 2:14:50.420]  Now Ivermectin and...
[2:14:50.420 --> 2:14:53.420]  I mean, because obviously they don't want people to know that.
[2:14:53.420 --> 2:14:56.420]  They want them scared taking the so-called vaccine.
[2:14:56.420 --> 2:14:57.420]  That's spot on.
[2:14:57.420 --> 2:15:00.420]  And there's another legal issue here
[2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:03.420]  that has not been properly looked at in the media,
[2:15:03.420 --> 2:15:09.420]  which is they can't allow any effective treatments
[2:15:09.420 --> 2:15:14.420]  because the emergency measures, the EAU,
[2:15:14.420 --> 2:15:20.420]  the emergency use authorization law says
[2:15:20.420 --> 2:15:24.420]  you cannot have the government doing
[2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:26.420]  the emergency authorizations
[2:15:26.420 --> 2:15:30.420]  if there are any, any one effective treatment.
[2:15:30.420 --> 2:15:33.420]  So if you have a treatment like hydroxychloroquine,
[2:15:33.420 --> 2:15:35.420]  which is extremely effective
[2:15:35.420 --> 2:15:38.420]  in treating this disease in combination...
[2:15:38.420 --> 2:15:40.420]  So I'd say there, Doc, we gotta go to break this.
[2:15:40.420 --> 2:15:41.420]  This is riveting.
[2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:43.420]  I want to know about where we're going, how we stop them,
[2:15:43.420 --> 2:15:45.420]  your ideas, what you think's coming next.
[2:15:45.420 --> 2:15:47.420]  Dr. Peter Bregan is our guest.
[2:15:47.420 --> 2:15:48.420]  Amazing information.
[2:15:48.420 --> 2:15:53.420]  Find him at bregan.com, B-R-E-G-G-I-N.com.
[2:15:53.420 --> 2:15:55.420]  And remember, we can only bypass the sensors
[2:15:55.420 --> 2:15:56.420]  when you take action.
[2:15:56.420 --> 2:15:59.420]  So get his book and spread the information.
[2:15:59.420 --> 2:16:01.420]  If you're concerned about the power grid
[2:16:01.420 --> 2:16:04.420]  and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[2:16:04.420 --> 2:16:06.420]  this will be the most important message
[2:16:06.420 --> 2:16:07.420]  you'll hear this year.
[2:16:07.420 --> 2:16:08.420]  Why?
[2:16:08.420 --> 2:16:10.420]  We now have a small number of solar generators
[2:16:10.420 --> 2:16:11.420]  back in stock.
[2:16:11.420 --> 2:16:13.420]  These emergency backup systems
[2:16:13.420 --> 2:16:15.420]  provide life-saving backup power
[2:16:15.420 --> 2:16:16.420]  when you need it most.
[2:16:16.420 --> 2:16:18.420]  And unlike gas generators,
[2:16:18.420 --> 2:16:20.420]  solar generators run quietly,
[2:16:20.420 --> 2:16:21.420]  emit no dangerous fumes,
[2:16:21.420 --> 2:16:23.420]  and produce an endless supply
[2:16:23.420 --> 2:16:25.420]  of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:25.420 --> 2:16:27.420]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather,
[2:16:27.420 --> 2:16:28.420]  power grid issues,
[2:16:28.420 --> 2:16:30.420]  or just getting off the grid,
[2:16:30.420 --> 2:16:32.420]  you'll never have to suffer through
[2:16:32.420 --> 2:16:34.420]  painful power outages again.
[2:16:34.420 --> 2:16:35.420]  Even better, all this week,
[2:16:35.420 --> 2:16:38.420]  radio listeners get over $700
[2:16:38.420 --> 2:16:40.420]  in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.

[2:16:57.420 --> 2:16:58.420]  Hey, everybody.
[2:16:58.420 --> 2:17:00.420]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans
[2:17:00.420 --> 2:17:02.420]  as a storable survival food,
[2:17:02.420 --> 2:17:03.420]  I've got great news.
[2:17:03.420 --> 2:17:05.420]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news
[2:17:05.420 --> 2:17:06.420]  you've heard in a while.
[2:17:06.420 --> 2:17:07.420]  Here's the thing.
[2:17:07.420 --> 2:17:09.420]  We've just received a fresh batch
[2:17:09.420 --> 2:17:11.420]  of gourmet heirloom beans,
[2:17:11.420 --> 2:17:12.420]  survival soup beans.
[2:17:12.420 --> 2:17:14.420]  These beans are gorgeous,
[2:17:14.420 --> 2:17:15.420]  highly nutritious,
[2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:16.420]  and above all,
[2:17:16.420 --> 2:17:18.420]  with no hesitation whatsoever,
[2:17:18.420 --> 2:17:20.420]  the best-tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:17:20.420 --> 2:17:21.420]  The best part?
[2:17:21.420 --> 2:17:24.420]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week
[2:17:24.420 --> 2:17:26.420]  for listeners who know
[2:17:26.420 --> 2:17:28.420]  higher food prices are coming
[2:17:28.420 --> 2:17:29.420]  and want an inflation hedge
[2:17:29.420 --> 2:17:31.420]  you can actually eat if you want to.
[2:17:31.420 --> 2:17:32.420]  It gets even better.
[2:17:32.420 --> 2:17:33.420]  With your permission
[2:17:33.420 --> 2:17:35.420]  and with a high regard for your health
[2:17:35.420 --> 2:17:36.420]  and well-being,
[2:17:36.420 --> 2:17:38.420]  I also want to send you two pounds
[2:17:38.420 --> 2:17:40.420]  of what we think is the single
[2:17:40.420 --> 2:17:42.420]  most underrated superfood
[2:17:42.420 --> 2:17:43.420]  in the world.
[2:17:43.420 --> 2:17:44.420]  Period.
[2:17:44.420 --> 2:17:46.420]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:46.420 --> 2:17:48.420]  that's soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:48.420 --> 2:17:49.420]  and discover the real reason
[2:17:49.420 --> 2:17:52.420]  we're giving this unusual superfood away
[2:17:52.420 --> 2:17:54.420]  at soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:54.420 --> 2:17:56.420]  that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[2:17:59.420 --> 2:18:01.420]  So what's the most important part?
[2:18:01.420 --> 2:18:02.420]  I've been saying a bulldozer
[2:18:02.420 --> 2:18:03.420]  running over the globalist.
[2:18:03.420 --> 2:18:05.420]  The treads, the wheels, the engine,
[2:18:05.420 --> 2:18:06.420]  the scoop on the front,
[2:18:06.420 --> 2:18:07.420]  it's all very important,
[2:18:07.420 --> 2:18:09.420]  but the fuel is paramount
[2:18:09.420 --> 2:18:11.420]  and that's my allegor.
[2:18:11.420 --> 2:18:13.420]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals,
[2:18:13.420 --> 2:18:15.420]  amino acids that synergistically work
[2:18:15.420 --> 2:18:17.420]  with six different natural forms
[2:18:17.420 --> 2:18:18.420]  of healthy clean energy
[2:18:18.420 --> 2:18:19.420]  that last for 10 hours
[2:18:19.420 --> 2:18:21.420]  in the average metabolic system,
[2:18:21.420 --> 2:18:22.420]  metabolism of a human.
[2:18:22.420 --> 2:18:23.420]  Some people get 15 hours out of this,
[2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:24.420]  some people get about 8 hours,
[2:18:24.420 --> 2:18:25.420]  but people take this,
[2:18:25.420 --> 2:18:26.420]  people take eating sports,
[2:18:26.420 --> 2:18:27.420]  people cannot believe it's the best
[2:18:27.420 --> 2:18:28.420]  they've ever had
[2:18:28.420 --> 2:18:30.420]  because it's not hype.
[2:18:30.420 --> 2:18:32.420]  Nobody puts as much product
[2:18:32.420 --> 2:18:34.420]  into their pre-workouts,
[2:18:34.420 --> 2:18:35.420]  their post-workouts.
[2:18:35.420 --> 2:18:36.420]  You can call us whatever you want.
[2:18:36.420 --> 2:18:37.420]  It's a total solution
[2:18:37.420 --> 2:18:39.420]  all around the best you're going to find.

[2:18:41.420 --> 2:18:42.420]  we don't roll.
[2:18:42.420 --> 2:18:44.420]  With you, we search forward together.
[2:18:44.420 --> 2:18:45.420]  It's like the bulldozer
[2:18:45.420 --> 2:18:46.420]  without the diesel fuel.
[2:18:46.420 --> 2:18:47.420]  If we don't have your financial support,
[2:18:47.420 --> 2:18:48.420]  we will be defeated.
[2:18:48.420 --> 2:18:49.420]  You support us and get products
[2:18:49.420 --> 2:18:50.420]  you already need
[2:18:50.420 --> 2:18:52.420]  that literally fuel your body and your mind.
[2:18:52.420 --> 2:18:53.420]  It's a win-win,

[2:19:26.420 --> 2:19:28.420]  My book will help anybody out there
[2:19:28.420 --> 2:19:29.420]  in addiction,
[2:19:29.420 --> 2:19:30.420]  and that's free shipping with the book.
[2:19:30.420 --> 2:19:31.420]  Right now,
[2:19:31.420 --> 2:19:32.420]  all of the specials
[2:19:32.420 --> 2:19:33.420]  I used to run,
[2:19:33.420 --> 2:19:34.420]  one here and one there,
[2:19:34.420 --> 2:19:35.420]  I put them all on there.
[2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:37.420]  The lowest prices you've ever seen,
[2:19:37.420 --> 2:19:38.420]  and we have our new bed.
[2:19:38.420 --> 2:19:39.420]  Everybody,
[2:19:39.420 --> 2:19:40.420]  I don't know if you've seen
[2:19:40.420 --> 2:19:41.420]  our bed infomercial.
[2:19:41.420 --> 2:19:42.420]  I developed this bed
[2:19:42.420 --> 2:19:43.420]  over a year and a half.
[2:19:43.420 --> 2:19:45.420]  Best mattress you'll ever sleep on.
[2:19:45.420 --> 2:19:46.420]  It's a combination of coils
[2:19:46.420 --> 2:19:47.420]  and patented foam,
[2:19:47.420 --> 2:19:48.420]  and they're amazing.
[2:19:48.420 --> 2:19:49.420]  There's nothing better
[2:19:49.420 --> 2:19:50.420]  when I make products.
[2:19:50.420 --> 2:19:51.420]  And they're not just amazing.
[2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:52.420]  The cost is not high,
[2:19:52.420 --> 2:19:53.420]  and you support freedom.
[2:19:53.420 --> 2:19:55.420]  Mypilla.com, promo code Alex.
[2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:56.420]  You've got so many great products,
[2:19:56.420 --> 2:19:57.420]  and we're just really proud
[2:19:57.420 --> 2:19:59.420]  of the work you're doing, Mike.
[2:19:59.420 --> 2:20:24.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:24.420 --> 2:20:25.420]  All right.
[2:20:25.420 --> 2:20:27.420]  He's one of the most prominent voices out there.
[2:20:27.420 --> 2:20:29.420]  He's a very highly respected author
[2:20:29.420 --> 2:20:30.420]  and researcher and psychiatrist,
[2:20:30.420 --> 2:20:31.420]  medical doctor,
[2:20:31.420 --> 2:20:32.420]  Dr. Peter Brigham.
[2:20:32.420 --> 2:20:33.420]  And he joins us.
[2:20:33.420 --> 2:20:35.420]  We shall also talk about his book, too,
[2:20:35.420 --> 2:20:37.420]  before he leaves us at the end of the hour,
[2:20:37.420 --> 2:20:38.420]  because it's important
[2:20:38.420 --> 2:20:40.420]  to get that information to bypass
[2:20:40.420 --> 2:20:41.420]  the sensors COVID-19
[2:20:41.420 --> 2:20:42.420]  and the global predators.
[2:20:42.420 --> 2:20:43.420]  In fact,
[2:20:43.420 --> 2:20:45.420]  let's talk about the book itself.
[2:20:45.420 --> 2:20:47.420]  And then the premeditation,
[2:20:47.420 --> 2:20:49.420]  where Gates said a year and a half ago,
[2:20:49.420 --> 2:20:50.420]  oh, you'll need yearly shots.
[2:20:50.420 --> 2:20:51.420]  And now they're going,
[2:20:51.420 --> 2:20:52.420]  oh, my God,
[2:20:52.420 --> 2:20:53.420]  we need yearly shots now.
[2:20:53.420 --> 2:20:54.420]  And as you said,
[2:20:54.420 --> 2:20:56.420]  you've reverse engineered it.
[2:20:56.420 --> 2:20:57.420]  It's all been pre-programmed.
[2:20:57.420 --> 2:20:59.420]  It's all been pre-planned.
[2:20:59.420 --> 2:21:00.420]  And it's just so bold.
[2:21:00.420 --> 2:21:01.420]  It's so criminal.
[2:21:01.420 --> 2:21:04.420]  But it's all based on censorship and ignorance.
[2:21:04.420 --> 2:21:07.420]  And I guess being able to intimidate
[2:21:07.420 --> 2:21:08.420]  the medical community.
[2:21:08.420 --> 2:21:10.420]  But I don't want the medical community,
[2:21:10.420 --> 2:21:11.420]  who overall is good people,
[2:21:11.420 --> 2:21:12.420]  scapegoated.
[2:21:12.420 --> 2:21:13.420]  It's been the doctors
[2:21:13.420 --> 2:21:15.420]  and epidemiologists and scientists
[2:21:15.420 --> 2:21:16.420]  and people like yourself
[2:21:16.420 --> 2:21:18.420]  that have been the vanguard,
[2:21:18.420 --> 2:21:20.420]  the vast majority of which
[2:21:20.420 --> 2:21:21.420]  have been saying no to this.
[2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:23.420]  So please continue, doctor.
[2:21:23.420 --> 2:21:27.420]  Yeah, let me cut to the real essence
[2:21:27.420 --> 2:21:30.420]  that everybody out there needs to know.
[2:21:30.420 --> 2:21:34.420]  The protein spike on COVID-19
[2:21:34.420 --> 2:21:37.420]  is nothing more than a weapon.
[2:21:37.420 --> 2:21:39.420]  And the weapon has two purposes,
[2:21:39.420 --> 2:21:42.420]  to exploit humanity
[2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:45.420]  and to control humanity.
[2:21:45.420 --> 2:21:49.420]  And that's why its origins are with Bill Gates,
[2:21:49.420 --> 2:21:51.420]  whose biggest impulse in the world
[2:21:51.420 --> 2:21:54.420]  is to exploit humanity.
[2:21:54.420 --> 2:21:55.420]  And Klaus Schwab,
[2:21:55.420 --> 2:21:57.420]  whose biggest impulse in the world,
[2:21:57.420 --> 2:22:00.420]  was to develop top-down government
[2:22:00.420 --> 2:22:01.420]  throughout the world
[2:22:01.420 --> 2:22:03.420]  that would be run basically
[2:22:03.420 --> 2:22:06.420]  through his organization
[2:22:06.420 --> 2:22:08.420]  and basically with Bill Gates
[2:22:08.420 --> 2:22:10.420]  and the World Health Organization.
[2:22:10.420 --> 2:22:12.420]  And they engineered that.
[2:22:12.420 --> 2:22:15.420]  They wrote it up in 2016.
[2:22:15.420 --> 2:22:17.420]  And I've got these amazing power points
[2:22:17.420 --> 2:22:20.420]  that they gave out to various organizations
[2:22:20.420 --> 2:22:22.420]  that actually documented
[2:22:22.420 --> 2:22:23.420]  the whole idea being
[2:22:23.420 --> 2:22:26.420]  the drug companies would never lose a dime.
[2:22:26.420 --> 2:22:27.420]  They'd make a fortune.
[2:22:27.420 --> 2:22:29.420]  And there's even a provision
[2:22:29.420 --> 2:22:31.420]  that if they make a lot, a lot of money,
[2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:33.420]  then it'll go back to CEPI itself,
[2:22:33.420 --> 2:22:37.420]  which goes back directly to Bill Gates
[2:22:37.420 --> 2:22:38.420]  and Klaus Schwab.
[2:22:38.420 --> 2:22:41.420]  So we're talking about an intention
[2:22:41.420 --> 2:22:44.420]  that is as old as time.
[2:22:44.420 --> 2:22:48.420]  It's the intention to control everyone,
[2:22:48.420 --> 2:22:51.420]  to control people, and to use them.
[2:22:51.420 --> 2:22:53.420]  It's the feudal system.
[2:22:53.420 --> 2:22:55.420]  It's the Middle Ages.
[2:22:55.420 --> 2:22:58.420]  It's Genghis Khan.
[2:22:58.420 --> 2:23:00.420]  It's Caesar.
[2:23:00.420 --> 2:23:02.420]  I mean, it's all the people
[2:23:02.420 --> 2:23:04.420]  who have tried to rule the world.
[2:23:04.420 --> 2:23:07.420]  And really interesting, Alex,
[2:23:07.420 --> 2:23:09.420]  that you were so far ahead
[2:23:09.420 --> 2:23:10.420]  of all of us on this.
[2:23:10.420 --> 2:23:12.420]  I'm Jewish.
[2:23:12.420 --> 2:23:14.420]  I really do believe that this is work
[2:23:14.420 --> 2:23:16.420]  I have to do.
[2:23:16.420 --> 2:23:18.420]  And Ginger and I believe that very, very deeply.
[2:23:18.420 --> 2:23:20.420]  What we're finding is that
[2:23:20.420 --> 2:23:23.420]  almost all the opposition right now
[2:23:23.420 --> 2:23:24.420]  is from Christians
[2:23:24.420 --> 2:23:27.420]  and a few very believing Jews.
[2:23:27.420 --> 2:23:30.420]  And these people really believe
[2:23:30.420 --> 2:23:32.420]  that the fight is between good navels,
[2:23:32.420 --> 2:23:33.420]  between God and the devil.
[2:23:33.420 --> 2:23:35.420]  I don't go to the devil theology,
[2:23:35.420 --> 2:23:37.420]  but I respect those who do.
[2:23:37.420 --> 2:23:40.420]  This is a colossal fight going on.
[2:23:40.420 --> 2:23:42.420]  And I think we should be proud
[2:23:42.420 --> 2:23:44.420]  to be alive today
[2:23:44.420 --> 2:23:46.420]  because the sites
[2:23:46.420 --> 2:23:48.420]  of this COVID-19 spear
[2:23:48.420 --> 2:23:50.420]  are fundamentally on America
[2:23:50.420 --> 2:23:52.420]  and on liberty.
[2:23:52.420 --> 2:23:54.420]  Klaus Schwab has actually written
[2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:57.420]  and said that America
[2:23:57.420 --> 2:23:59.420]  is incompatible.
[2:23:59.420 --> 2:24:01.420]  Its existence as a free nation
[2:24:01.420 --> 2:24:03.420]  and as a nationalistic country
[2:24:03.420 --> 2:24:05.420]  and a liberty-loving country
[2:24:05.420 --> 2:24:07.420]  is in the way
[2:24:07.420 --> 2:24:09.420]  of all of his efforts to build.
[2:24:09.420 --> 2:24:11.420]  Oh, let me just back you up.
[2:24:11.420 --> 2:24:13.420]  His own Wikipedia says
[2:24:13.420 --> 2:24:15.420]  it wants to get rid of Western democracies.
[2:24:15.420 --> 2:24:17.420]  It wants to capture our countries
[2:24:17.420 --> 2:24:19.420]  and capture us.
[2:24:19.420 --> 2:24:21.420]  Talk about the second coming of Hitler.
[2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:23.420]  This is as close as it gets.
[2:24:23.420 --> 2:24:26.420]  Well, and the ambitions
[2:24:26.420 --> 2:24:28.420]  are much wider than Hitler.
[2:24:28.420 --> 2:24:30.420]  And unlike Hitler,
[2:24:30.420 --> 2:24:33.420]  they are tied in with our biggest corporations.
[2:24:33.420 --> 2:24:35.420]  I'll tell you, by the way,
[2:24:35.420 --> 2:24:38.420]  interesting new document from SEPI.
[2:24:38.420 --> 2:24:40.420]  I don't think you've gotten this one from us yet.
[2:24:40.420 --> 2:24:42.420]  No, we haven't.
[2:24:42.420 --> 2:24:45.420]  2022 to 2026.
[2:24:45.420 --> 2:24:48.420]  Guess what they're putting the next four billion into?
[2:24:48.420 --> 2:24:51.420]  The variant COVID-19
[2:24:51.420 --> 2:24:53.420]  viruses.
[2:24:53.420 --> 2:24:55.420]  These variants, which are,
[2:24:55.420 --> 2:24:57.420]  in fact, less dangerous,
[2:24:57.420 --> 2:24:59.420]  more contagious,
[2:24:59.420 --> 2:25:02.420]  but when you do, when you vaccinate people,
[2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:04.420]  wholesale, you just get more and more variants
[2:25:04.420 --> 2:25:06.420]  that are escaping the process
[2:25:06.420 --> 2:25:08.420]  of the vaccination.
[2:25:08.420 --> 2:25:10.420]  And so they're just lining it up now
[2:25:10.420 --> 2:25:13.420]  for one after another
[2:25:13.420 --> 2:25:15.420]  of vaccines.
[2:25:15.420 --> 2:25:17.420]  And we have to stop it.
[2:25:17.420 --> 2:25:19.420]  I want to make a comment on children,
[2:25:19.420 --> 2:25:21.420]  because, I mean, I think we really should start with
[2:25:21.420 --> 2:25:23.420]  is the mothers and fathers of the world
[2:25:23.420 --> 2:25:25.420]  protecting their children.
[2:25:25.420 --> 2:25:27.420]  I agree, because you see, like,
[2:25:27.420 --> 2:25:29.420]  de Blasio licking his lips going,
[2:25:29.420 --> 2:25:31.420]  we've got to get the children.
[2:25:31.420 --> 2:25:33.420]  And it's like a cartoon or something.
[2:25:33.420 --> 2:25:35.420]  He looks like a villain, a wolf when he eats
[2:25:35.420 --> 2:25:37.420]  Little Red Riding Hood.
[2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:39.420]  What the hell is going on there?
[2:25:39.420 --> 2:25:41.420]  Well, they're predators.
[2:25:41.420 --> 2:25:43.420]  They're no different from the people I work.
[2:25:43.420 --> 2:25:45.420]  I've had a lot of prison experience.
[2:25:45.420 --> 2:25:47.420]  I've done a lot of medical legal work.
[2:25:47.420 --> 2:25:49.420]  By the way, against the drug companies,
[2:25:49.420 --> 2:25:51.420]  a lot of product cases against the drug companies
[2:25:51.420 --> 2:25:53.420]  where I have a lot of my knowledge from
[2:25:53.420 --> 2:25:55.420]  to do this research.
[2:25:55.420 --> 2:25:57.420]  But I've worked with a lot of people
[2:25:57.420 --> 2:25:59.420]  who were involved in mass murder
[2:25:59.420 --> 2:26:01.420]  and crime and so on.
[2:26:01.420 --> 2:26:03.420]  And these people have,
[2:26:03.420 --> 2:26:05.420]  they have the same kind of personality
[2:26:05.420 --> 2:26:07.420]  as the mass murderer.
[2:26:07.420 --> 2:26:09.420]  They don't believe in God.
[2:26:09.420 --> 2:26:11.420]  They identify with no one.
[2:26:11.420 --> 2:26:13.420]  They do not think of themselves
[2:26:13.420 --> 2:26:15.420]  as Americans.
[2:26:15.420 --> 2:26:17.420]  They don't think of themselves as patriots.
[2:26:17.420 --> 2:26:19.420]  They think of themselves as people
[2:26:19.420 --> 2:26:21.420]  who are going to get even and going to plunder.
[2:26:21.420 --> 2:26:23.420]  And this is who they are.
[2:26:23.420 --> 2:26:25.420]  It's who Hitler was and Mussolini.
[2:26:25.420 --> 2:26:27.420]  So they're megalomaniac predators
[2:26:27.420 --> 2:26:29.420]  on a power trip.
[2:26:29.420 --> 2:26:31.420]  Yes, that's not a bad summary.
[2:26:31.420 --> 2:26:33.420]  And I don't mean megalomaniac
[2:26:33.420 --> 2:26:35.420]  in terms of a psychiatric diagnosis.
[2:26:35.420 --> 2:26:37.420]  I mean in its common use.
[2:26:37.420 --> 2:26:39.420]  I'm not going to make diagnoses here.
[2:26:39.420 --> 2:26:41.420]  They make them megalomaniacal
[2:26:41.420 --> 2:26:43.420]  in that they have these grandiose
[2:26:43.420 --> 2:26:45.420]  outrageous ideas.
[2:26:45.420 --> 2:26:47.420]  Well, look at the things Bill Gates has tried to do.
[2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:49.420]  I mean, they stopped them in Norway
[2:26:49.420 --> 2:26:51.420]  but he's going to fly a rocket.
[2:26:51.420 --> 2:26:53.420]  Block out the sun in Norway.
[2:26:53.420 --> 2:26:55.420]  An experiment where maybe
[2:26:55.420 --> 2:26:57.420]  that would stop global warming.
[2:26:57.420 --> 2:26:59.420]  Block out the sun.
[2:26:59.420 --> 2:27:01.420]  It's like a Greek mythology.
[2:27:01.420 --> 2:27:03.420]  And then he tried to block out the sun.
[2:27:03.420 --> 2:27:05.420]  And you know,
[2:27:05.420 --> 2:27:07.420]  I laugh but it's so
[2:27:07.420 --> 2:27:09.420]  painful and so tragic and so bad.
[2:27:09.420 --> 2:27:11.420]  And
[2:27:11.420 --> 2:27:13.420]  this is a time
[2:27:13.420 --> 2:27:15.420]  when we should be glad to be alive though.
[2:27:15.420 --> 2:27:17.420]  It's amazing to work with people like you.
[2:27:17.420 --> 2:27:19.420]  And it's amazing to be
[2:27:19.420 --> 2:27:21.420]  working with some of the people.
[2:27:21.420 --> 2:27:23.420]  I think you've had
[2:27:23.420 --> 2:27:25.420]  my friend
[2:27:25.420 --> 2:27:27.420]  McCullough on.
[2:27:27.420 --> 2:27:29.420]  He's an amazing man.
[2:27:29.420 --> 2:27:31.420]  I work closely with him.
[2:27:31.420 --> 2:27:33.420]  I hope you've had
[2:27:33.420 --> 2:27:35.420]  Zev Zelenko on.
[2:27:35.420 --> 2:27:37.420]  We love him. He's amazing.
[2:27:37.420 --> 2:27:39.420]  Yeah. And these are people with a vast
[2:27:39.420 --> 2:27:41.420]  vision.
[2:27:41.420 --> 2:27:43.420]  They're doctors, they're scientists
[2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:45.420]  but they see that it's now time
[2:27:45.420 --> 2:27:47.420]  for this country to join together.
[2:27:47.420 --> 2:27:49.420]  Because we are the last hope of the world.
[2:27:49.420 --> 2:27:51.420]  We're the last hope of ourselves, of course.
[2:27:51.420 --> 2:27:53.420]  And it's exactly
[2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:55.420]  the deplorables who we are.
[2:27:55.420 --> 2:27:57.420]  We're the people who think there's something
[2:27:57.420 --> 2:27:59.420]  greater than ourselves in the world.
[2:27:59.420 --> 2:28:01.420]  We don't believe in manipulating
[2:28:01.420 --> 2:28:03.420]  human brain. We don't think
[2:28:03.420 --> 2:28:05.420]  the government should be a propaganda machine.
[2:28:05.420 --> 2:28:07.420]  We think it should be protecting our freedoms.
[2:28:07.420 --> 2:28:09.420]  We have these simple ideas that go back
[2:28:09.420 --> 2:28:11.420]  to the founders and
[2:28:11.420 --> 2:28:13.420]  I totally agree. Dr. Peter Bergen
[2:28:13.420 --> 2:28:15.420]  stay right there. People can.
[2:28:15.420 --> 2:28:17.420]  I love the URL because I was saying
[2:28:17.420 --> 2:28:19.420]  bergen.com but
[2:28:19.420 --> 2:28:21.420]  we are the prey.com. That's the best site to visit.
[2:28:21.420 --> 2:28:23.420]  We are the prey.com.
[2:28:23.420 --> 2:28:25.420]  If you go there
[2:28:25.420 --> 2:28:27.420]  in the next few days and you buy the book
[2:28:27.420 --> 2:28:29.420]  pre-purchase at a good price
[2:28:29.420 --> 2:28:31.420]  you will also get the manuscript.
[2:28:31.420 --> 2:28:33.420]  No one's ever done this before.
[2:28:33.420 --> 2:28:35.420]  We've been doing this for months.
[2:28:35.420 --> 2:28:37.420]  You'll also get the up-to-date manuscript
[2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:39.420]  of the book. So the information
[2:28:39.420 --> 2:28:41.420]  is going out. The book is already sold
[2:28:41.420 --> 2:28:43.420]  about 11,000 copies.
[2:28:43.420 --> 2:28:45.420]  So that's 11,000 manuscripts
[2:28:45.420 --> 2:28:47.420]  that have already gone out.
[2:28:47.420 --> 2:28:49.420]  Hold on. Tell us about this because it's key
[2:28:49.420 --> 2:28:51.420]  to get these live votes out there
[2:28:51.420 --> 2:28:53.420]  and to challenge this system.
[2:28:53.420 --> 2:28:55.420]  Head on with Dr. Peter Bergen.
[2:28:55.420 --> 2:28:57.420]  If you're
[2:28:57.420 --> 2:28:59.420]  concerned about the power grid
[2:28:59.420 --> 2:29:01.420]  and want to generate your own supply
[2:29:01.420 --> 2:29:03.420]  of off-grid electricity
[2:29:03.420 --> 2:29:05.420]  this will be the most important message
[2:29:05.420 --> 2:29:07.420]  you'll hear this year. Here's why.
[2:29:07.420 --> 2:29:09.420]  We now have a small number of solar
[2:29:09.420 --> 2:29:11.420]  generators back in stock.
[2:29:11.420 --> 2:29:13.420]  These emergency backup systems
[2:29:13.420 --> 2:29:15.420]  provide life-saving backup power
[2:29:15.420 --> 2:29:17.420]  when you need it most. And unlike gas
[2:29:17.420 --> 2:29:19.420]  generators, solar generators run
[2:29:19.420 --> 2:29:21.420]  quietly, emit no dangerous fumes
[2:29:21.420 --> 2:29:23.420]  and produce an endless supply
[2:29:23.420 --> 2:29:25.420]  of free electricity from the sun.
[2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:27.420]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather,
[2:29:27.420 --> 2:29:29.420]  power grid issues, or just getting
[2:29:29.420 --> 2:29:31.420]  off the grid, you'll never have to
[2:29:31.420 --> 2:29:33.420]  suffer through painful power outages
[2:29:33.420 --> 2:29:35.420]  again. Even better, all this week
[2:29:35.420 --> 2:29:37.420]  radio listeners get over $700
[2:29:37.420 --> 2:29:39.420]  in free off-the-grid
[2:29:39.420 --> 2:29:41.420]  bonuses too. Go to mysolarbackup.com
[2:29:41.420 --> 2:29:43.420]  to learn more and check
[2:29:43.420 --> 2:29:45.420]  availability. That's mysolarbackup.com
[2:29:45.420 --> 2:29:47.420]  Look for the free report. Crisis
[2:29:47.420 --> 2:29:49.420]  cooling. How to make absolutely
[2:29:49.420 --> 2:29:51.420]  sure your meat, milk and medicines
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:53.420]  stay safe and cool in any power
[2:29:53.420 --> 2:29:55.420]  outage. Yours free
[2:29:55.420 --> 2:29:57.420]  at mysolarbackup.com
[2:29:59.420 --> 2:30:01.420]  So, when I first started taking
[2:30:01.420 --> 2:30:03.420]  survival skills, basically I was
[2:30:03.420 --> 2:30:05.420]  275 pounds. I was overweight. I had
[2:30:05.420 --> 2:30:07.420]  brain fog like you wouldn't believe. I was
[2:30:07.420 --> 2:30:09.420]  barely holding on to a job. And I heard
[2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:11.420]  Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[2:30:11.420 --> 2:30:13.420]  So, the first one I got was the original
[2:30:13.420 --> 2:30:15.420]  survival skills, the X1. And it worked
[2:30:15.420 --> 2:30:17.420]  pretty good. And then shortly thereafter
[2:30:17.420 --> 2:30:19.420]  you came out with that too. You had, you know, with a deep
[2:30:19.420 --> 2:30:21.420]  source, you know, and I got really excited about that
[2:30:21.420 --> 2:30:23.420]  so I took it. And man, in two weeks
[2:30:23.420 --> 2:30:25.420]  I went from brain fog to like
[2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:27.420]  literally like my brain was
[2:30:27.420 --> 2:30:29.420]  enlightened. You know, I could think
[2:30:29.420 --> 2:30:31.420]  again. I could connect with people again.
[2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:33.420]  And over the course of the next
[2:30:33.420 --> 2:30:35.420]  couple of years I got my health back
[2:30:35.420 --> 2:30:37.420]  and I religiously take basically all of your
[2:30:37.420 --> 2:30:39.420]  supplements. They're all absolutely
[2:30:39.420 --> 2:30:41.420]  amazing supplements. The one I like recently
[2:30:41.420 --> 2:30:43.420]  is Knockout. It literally like if you want
[2:30:43.420 --> 2:30:45.420]  to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works.
[2:30:45.420 --> 2:30:47.420]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get
[2:30:47.420 --> 2:30:49.420]  ourselves clean. We have to break free
[2:30:49.420 --> 2:30:51.420]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do
[2:30:51.420 --> 2:30:53.420]  that is to take our own health into
[2:30:53.420 --> 2:30:55.420]  our own hands. Beautifully said, brother.
[2:30:55.420 --> 2:30:57.420]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[2:30:59.420 --> 2:31:01.420]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid
[2:31:01.420 --> 2:31:03.420]  1990s. And then imagine
[2:31:03.420 --> 2:31:05.420]  a science fiction movie set in the year
[2:31:05.420 --> 2:31:07.420]  2020 where a world government
[2:31:07.420 --> 2:31:09.420]  is being established, where members of
[2:31:09.420 --> 2:31:11.420]  Congress and former presidents are
[2:31:11.420 --> 2:31:13.420]  censured by big tech. And where if you don't
[2:31:13.420 --> 2:31:15.420]  take an experimental injection
[2:31:15.420 --> 2:31:17.420]  that grows blood clots and
[2:31:17.420 --> 2:31:19.420]  prions all over your body, then
[2:31:19.420 --> 2:31:21.420]  you're not allowed to fly
[2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:23.420]  on an airplane. Think about
[2:31:23.420 --> 2:31:25.420]  that because that's where we are.
[2:31:25.420 --> 2:31:27.420]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago
[2:31:27.420 --> 2:31:29.420]  tell just five years ago that somebody
[2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:31.420]  told you this would be happening.
[2:31:31.420 --> 2:31:33.420]  But it is happening
[2:31:33.420 --> 2:31:35.420]  now. And then they tell you, oh, sorry
[2:31:35.420 --> 2:31:37.420]  it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy
[2:31:37.420 --> 2:31:39.420]  and it doesn't really work. So you got to take
[2:31:39.420 --> 2:31:41.420]  it every few months. And the people that
[2:31:41.420 --> 2:31:43.420]  have submitted say, great.
[2:31:43.420 --> 2:31:45.420]  I want to take it all the time so I can go
[2:31:45.420 --> 2:31:47.420]  outside and not get sick from COVID.
[2:31:47.420 --> 2:31:49.420]  Even though it gets you sick from COVID. And now
[2:31:49.420 --> 2:31:51.420]  there's record numbers of really sick people
[2:31:51.420 --> 2:31:53.420]  from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[2:31:53.420 --> 2:31:55.420]  And that's in mainline studies.
[2:31:55.420 --> 2:31:57.420]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this.
[2:31:57.420 --> 2:31:59.420]  Need to go to prison for it right now.
[2:31:59.420 --> 2:32:01.420]  I'm not funded by George Soros. I'm not
[2:32:01.420 --> 2:32:03.420]  funded by the Democratic Party. I'm funded
[2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:05.420]  by you. We got great products you need.

[2:33:29.420 --> 2:33:57.420]  Any questions?
[2:33:57.420 --> 2:34:07.420]  Thank you so much.
[2:34:27.420 --> 2:34:29.420]  You know, we're doing this for the earth,
[2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:31.420]  but we're joined by a well-known author
[2:34:31.420 --> 2:34:33.420]  and researcher, Dr. Peter Brighan,
[2:34:33.420 --> 2:34:35.420]  who's here with us today.
[2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:37.420]  And we are the
[2:34:37.420 --> 2:34:39.420]  prey.com is the website,
[2:34:39.420 --> 2:34:41.420]  his new book. It's on pre-order right now.
[2:34:41.420 --> 2:34:43.420]  So we got two segments left with you.
[2:34:43.420 --> 2:34:45.420]  I'd love to have you back for two, three hours, or
[2:34:45.420 --> 2:34:47.420]  I'm going to do a Saturday show tomorrow. It's commercial free.
[2:34:47.420 --> 2:34:49.420]  So you're welcome to come on that if you want as well.
[2:34:49.420 --> 2:34:51.420]  Those are very popular, but just to impart
[2:34:51.420 --> 2:34:53.420]  to people, because you're a psychiatrist,
[2:34:53.420 --> 2:34:55.420]  so you try to get involved with the mind.
[2:34:55.420 --> 2:34:57.420]  I know this was coming a long time ago from their own documents,
[2:34:57.420 --> 2:34:59.420]  but I'm being honest with you.
[2:34:59.420 --> 2:35:01.420]  As a father, as a person,
[2:35:01.420 --> 2:35:03.420]  I'm having real problems dealing with this
[2:35:03.420 --> 2:35:05.420]  myself. I don't want to say I'm depressed.
[2:35:05.420 --> 2:35:07.420]  It's beyond that. It's beyond even fatalistic.
[2:35:07.420 --> 2:35:09.420]  It's more like
[2:35:09.420 --> 2:35:11.420]  I can't believe it
[2:35:11.420 --> 2:35:13.420]  even though I knew it was coming, and it's more like
[2:35:13.420 --> 2:35:15.420]  my mouth's hanging open, and I just
[2:35:15.420 --> 2:35:17.420]  I asked myself
[2:35:17.420 --> 2:35:19.420]  how did we get here,
[2:35:19.420 --> 2:35:21.420]  and then I have a feeling of guilt that I haven't
[2:35:21.420 --> 2:35:23.420]  done enough, and then I get frustrated
[2:35:23.420 --> 2:35:25.420]  to see people that don't know it's
[2:35:25.420 --> 2:35:27.420]  how are you processing this?
[2:35:27.420 --> 2:35:29.420]  Because for anybody out there,
[2:35:29.420 --> 2:35:31.420]  even someone that's trained to know how their mind works,
[2:35:31.420 --> 2:35:33.420]  how
[2:35:33.420 --> 2:35:35.420]  should the public in your view deal
[2:35:35.420 --> 2:35:37.420]  with something like this? Because it's not
[2:35:37.420 --> 2:35:39.420]  it's not exciting to give people horrible
[2:35:39.420 --> 2:35:41.420]  news, but it's a positive thing
[2:35:41.420 --> 2:35:43.420]  so we could do something, right?
[2:35:43.420 --> 2:35:45.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:35:45.420 --> 2:35:47.420]  Alex, everything you just
[2:35:47.420 --> 2:35:49.420]  said about what you've been going through,
[2:35:49.420 --> 2:35:51.420]  Ginger and I
[2:35:51.420 --> 2:35:53.420]  support each other and help each other
[2:35:53.420 --> 2:35:55.420]  because we're going through this
[2:35:55.420 --> 2:35:57.420]  daily
[2:35:57.420 --> 2:35:59.420]  and sometimes especially
[2:35:59.420 --> 2:36:01.420]  with great difficulty.
[2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:03.420]  I think that one of the things
[2:36:03.420 --> 2:36:05.420]  that psychiatry misses
[2:36:05.420 --> 2:36:07.420]  and psychology
[2:36:07.420 --> 2:36:09.420]  in general is that
[2:36:09.420 --> 2:36:11.420]  the best response
[2:36:11.420 --> 2:36:13.420]  to overwhelming oppression
[2:36:13.420 --> 2:36:15.420]  is overwhelming positiveness
[2:36:15.420 --> 2:36:17.420]  and determination.
[2:36:17.420 --> 2:36:19.420]  And I think that's why most of the
[2:36:19.420 --> 2:36:21.420]  people who are
[2:36:21.420 --> 2:36:23.420]  doing this fight, or people who
[2:36:23.420 --> 2:36:25.420]  believe in something much higher than themselves
[2:36:25.420 --> 2:36:27.420]  in their own lives,
[2:36:27.420 --> 2:36:29.420]  they believe in God, they believe in some higher
[2:36:29.420 --> 2:36:31.420]  ideals,
[2:36:31.420 --> 2:36:33.420]  they love their families, they're doing this
[2:36:33.420 --> 2:36:35.420]  for their grandchildren and children,
[2:36:35.420 --> 2:36:37.420]  but also just for the principle
[2:36:37.420 --> 2:36:39.420]  of liberty,
[2:36:39.420 --> 2:36:41.420]  the Declaration of Independence says that
[2:36:41.420 --> 2:36:43.420]  given by nature, given by God,
[2:36:43.420 --> 2:36:45.420]  however you want to feel it,
[2:36:45.420 --> 2:36:47.420]  we are treasures,
[2:36:47.420 --> 2:36:49.420]  we are
[2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:51.420]  much more than the biology
[2:36:51.420 --> 2:36:53.420]  they think we are.
[2:36:53.420 --> 2:36:55.420]  We're beings, we matter
[2:36:55.420 --> 2:36:57.420]  each and every one of us,
[2:36:57.420 --> 2:36:59.420]  the old, the young, the black, the white,
[2:36:59.420 --> 2:37:01.420]  doesn't make any difference. None of it makes any difference.
[2:37:01.420 --> 2:37:03.420]  We're human beings.
[2:37:03.420 --> 2:37:05.420]  These people hate human beings.
[2:37:05.420 --> 2:37:07.420]  That's right, we have to declare our inherent value
[2:37:07.420 --> 2:37:09.420]  and our inherent fact
[2:37:09.420 --> 2:37:11.420]  that we're made by God
[2:37:11.420 --> 2:37:13.420]  because that's what they hate. They want us just to be
[2:37:13.420 --> 2:37:15.420]  machines that they claim they control.
[2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:17.420]  But then they claim their sentient,
[2:37:17.420 --> 2:37:19.420]  Bill Gates thinks he's
[2:37:19.420 --> 2:37:21.420]  sentient, he thinks we are.
[2:37:23.420 --> 2:37:25.420]  Well, you know,
[2:37:25.420 --> 2:37:27.420]  every predator,
[2:37:27.420 --> 2:37:29.420]  whether it's the person
[2:37:29.420 --> 2:37:31.420]  who loses
[2:37:31.420 --> 2:37:33.420]  his temper at somebody in a bar
[2:37:33.420 --> 2:37:35.420]  and kills them, or whether they're
[2:37:35.420 --> 2:37:37.420]  these giant organized predators,
[2:37:37.420 --> 2:37:39.420]  they all think they're doing the right thing
[2:37:39.420 --> 2:37:41.420]  and the good thing and the guy,
[2:37:41.420 --> 2:37:43.420]  the other people deserve it.
[2:37:43.420 --> 2:37:45.420]  It's only the very few people
[2:37:45.420 --> 2:37:47.420]  who are driven to violence by
[2:37:47.420 --> 2:37:49.420]  brain damage, brain injury.
[2:37:49.420 --> 2:37:51.420]  I see a lot of people who are driven to violence
[2:37:51.420 --> 2:37:53.420]  by psychiatric drugs.
[2:37:53.420 --> 2:37:55.420]  We know people are driven to violence by alcohol.
[2:37:55.420 --> 2:37:57.420]  But these folks
[2:37:57.420 --> 2:37:59.420]  who have a really good intact mind
[2:37:59.420 --> 2:38:01.420]  and carrying out willfully
[2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:03.420]  these acts, they
[2:38:03.420 --> 2:38:05.420]  always believe they are doing
[2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:07.420]  the important, best
[2:38:07.420 --> 2:38:09.420]  right thing and they justify it.
[2:38:09.420 --> 2:38:11.420]  We have to know
[2:38:11.420 --> 2:38:13.420]  that in fact they are not.
[2:38:13.420 --> 2:38:15.420]  They are filled with hatred,
[2:38:15.420 --> 2:38:17.420]  resentments, megalomania.
[2:38:17.420 --> 2:38:19.420]  And we have to realize
[2:38:19.420 --> 2:38:21.420]  that this is not the
[2:38:21.420 --> 2:38:23.420]  worst moment in time. This is the best
[2:38:23.420 --> 2:38:25.420]  moment in time. This is the
[2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:27.420]  moment in time where for the second time
[2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:29.420]  liberty
[2:38:29.420 --> 2:38:31.420]  can dominate over evil
[2:38:31.420 --> 2:38:33.420]  and God can dominate over evil
[2:38:33.420 --> 2:38:35.420]  in the history of the world.
[2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:37.420]  I agree, this is a great opportunity.
[2:38:37.420 --> 2:38:39.420]  You're right. What would you call this historical moment, Dr?
[2:38:39.420 --> 2:38:41.420]  Well, I think of
[2:38:41.420 --> 2:38:43.420]  us as refounders. This is the refounding
[2:38:43.420 --> 2:38:45.420]  of America. Are we going to
[2:38:45.420 --> 2:38:47.420]  refound our country?
[2:38:47.420 --> 2:38:49.420]  Or are we not?
[2:38:49.420 --> 2:38:51.420]  And the more of us who sit
[2:38:51.420 --> 2:38:53.420]  by, the less hope there is
[2:38:53.420 --> 2:38:55.420]  and the more of us that join in.
[2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:57.420]  I also want to say that
[2:38:57.420 --> 2:38:59.420]  in many ways, and I wonder if this is true
[2:38:59.420 --> 2:39:01.420]  of you too, Alex, I'd be interested to know
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:03.420]  this is some of the most fulfilling
[2:39:03.420 --> 2:39:05.420]  days I've ever had in my whole life.
[2:39:05.420 --> 2:39:07.420]  I have never shared
[2:39:07.420 --> 2:39:09.420]  with so many people a
[2:39:09.420 --> 2:39:11.420]  common goal.
[2:39:11.420 --> 2:39:13.420]  When I was called the conscience of psychiatry,
[2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:15.420]  I was pretty much by myself. There are no other
[2:39:15.420 --> 2:39:17.420]  consciences like that in the medical profession.
[2:39:17.420 --> 2:39:19.420]  I mean, I am not
[2:39:19.420 --> 2:39:21.420]  the conscience of COVID-19 or the
[2:39:21.420 --> 2:39:23.420]  conscience of the world. There are
[2:39:23.420 --> 2:39:25.420]  hundreds,
[2:39:25.420 --> 2:39:27.420]  probably millions of people
[2:39:27.420 --> 2:39:29.420]  sharing this goal.
[2:39:29.420 --> 2:39:31.420]  Oh, I totally agree that
[2:39:31.420 --> 2:39:33.420]  humanity's awakening,
[2:39:33.420 --> 2:39:35.420]  humanity's 50 times more awake than
[2:39:35.420 --> 2:39:37.420]  we were just 10 years ago, and it's beautiful.
[2:39:37.420 --> 2:39:39.420]  It's a paradox, but you're absolutely
[2:39:39.420 --> 2:39:41.420]  right. I mean, the human consciousness
[2:39:41.420 --> 2:39:43.420]  is coming together like racism
[2:39:43.420 --> 2:39:45.420]  and stuff is like to the side now.
[2:39:45.420 --> 2:39:47.420]  It's like people are coming together.
[2:39:47.420 --> 2:39:49.420]  Yeah, this is
[2:39:49.420 --> 2:39:51.420]  absolutely true. And one of the things
[2:39:51.420 --> 2:39:53.420]  we have found is we have more
[2:39:53.420 --> 2:39:55.420]  friends now than we've had in our entire
[2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:57.420]  lives, even though
[2:39:57.420 --> 2:39:59.420]  they're all long-distance
[2:39:59.420 --> 2:40:01.420]  friends, except for
[2:40:01.420 --> 2:40:03.420]  people, of course, right around us
[2:40:03.420 --> 2:40:05.420]  and a few people in the community.
[2:40:05.420 --> 2:40:07.420]  And this is just a wonderful
[2:40:07.420 --> 2:40:09.420]  experience.
[2:40:09.420 --> 2:40:11.420]  I'm going to connect you with some people
[2:40:11.420 --> 2:40:13.420]  that you have been able to connect
[2:40:13.420 --> 2:40:15.420]  to. You're connecting me
[2:40:15.420 --> 2:40:17.420]  with millions of people, and we're
[2:40:17.420 --> 2:40:19.420]  all doing this together
[2:40:19.420 --> 2:40:21.420]  and it's just a really
[2:40:21.420 --> 2:40:23.420]  remarkable time. So that's how we should be positive, because
[2:40:23.420 --> 2:40:25.420]  I am overall a lot of energy
[2:40:25.420 --> 2:40:27.420]  and feel energized, but also just
[2:40:27.420 --> 2:40:29.420]  feel daunted with the magnitude
[2:40:29.420 --> 2:40:31.420]  of this evil to be
[2:40:31.420 --> 2:40:33.420]  face it.
[2:40:33.420 --> 2:40:35.420]  I'm glad you're positive. I'm overall
[2:40:35.420 --> 2:40:37.420]  positive too, doctor, but I'm pretty shook
[2:40:37.420 --> 2:40:39.420]  up, actually, too. My wife is.
[2:40:39.420 --> 2:40:41.420]  I'll tell you another thing
[2:40:41.420 --> 2:40:43.420]  that helps, Alex.
[2:40:43.420 --> 2:40:45.420]  And that is the fate of
[2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:47.420]  humanity has always been under
[2:40:47.420 --> 2:40:49.420]  the heel of oppression ever
[2:40:49.420 --> 2:40:51.420]  since we went into villages
[2:40:51.420 --> 2:40:53.420]  five or ten thousand years ago.
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:40:55.420]  I mean, over our whole time
[2:40:55.420 --> 2:40:57.420]  period, we were hunters and
[2:40:57.420 --> 2:40:59.420]  gatherers, very independent, small
[2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:01.420]  groups, loving
[2:41:01.420 --> 2:41:03.420]  families working together,
[2:41:03.420 --> 2:41:05.420]  no dictators. But once
[2:41:05.420 --> 2:41:07.420]  we got into groups, we became very vulnerable
[2:41:07.420 --> 2:41:09.420]  to this.
[2:41:09.420 --> 2:41:11.420]  And the founding of America was
[2:41:11.420 --> 2:41:13.420]  a huge exception.
[2:41:13.420 --> 2:41:15.420]  It's not like we should feel sorry for ourselves.
[2:41:15.420 --> 2:41:17.420]  Oh, my God, we're going to be
[2:41:17.420 --> 2:41:19.420]  under the heel of oppression.
[2:41:19.420 --> 2:41:21.420]  That's been a lot of people.
[2:41:21.420 --> 2:41:23.420]  We are blessed with a degree
[2:41:23.420 --> 2:41:25.420]  of freedom. We still maintain in
[2:41:25.420 --> 2:41:27.420]  America and the right
[2:41:27.420 --> 2:41:29.420]  since the beginning of a grand society
[2:41:29.420 --> 2:41:31.420]  that set up the priest class and the
[2:41:31.420 --> 2:41:33.420]  oppressors that would always take advantage
[2:41:33.420 --> 2:41:35.420]  of that. And so this is a metam, you're
[2:41:35.420 --> 2:41:37.420]  saying it's a it's a coming of age.
[2:41:37.420 --> 2:41:39.420]  We're going through here and we can make it through this
[2:41:39.420 --> 2:41:41.420]  challenge and Bill Gates. I think
[2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:43.420]  what you're saying is a real golden age
[2:41:43.420 --> 2:41:45.420]  is waiting.
[2:41:45.420 --> 2:41:47.420]  I think the golden age is up
[2:41:47.420 --> 2:41:49.420]  to God.
[2:41:49.420 --> 2:41:51.420]  I'm sure you actually agree with me on that one.
[2:41:51.420 --> 2:41:53.420]  Oh, yeah. But yes, a better
[2:41:53.420 --> 2:41:55.420]  time of more freedom
[2:41:55.420 --> 2:41:57.420]  is here when
[2:41:57.420 --> 2:41:59.420]  we win. It's going to be a better
[2:41:59.420 --> 2:42:01.420]  time with more freedom,
[2:42:01.420 --> 2:42:03.420]  more people seeing the truth.
[2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:05.420]  Do you agree that the globalists made their move
[2:42:05.420 --> 2:42:07.420]  out of weakness, that they've been in trouble?
[2:42:07.420 --> 2:42:09.420]  Yes, well, you know
[2:42:09.420 --> 2:42:11.420]  the plan that I as I understood
[2:42:11.420 --> 2:42:13.420]  it was really to make them move
[2:42:13.420 --> 2:42:15.420]  in 2021.
[2:42:15.420 --> 2:42:17.420]  But when Trump, so as you brought this up
[2:42:17.420 --> 2:42:19.420]  when Trump went after
[2:42:19.420 --> 2:42:21.420]  China, you know, and Trump went
[2:42:21.420 --> 2:42:23.420]  after the globalists, not too many people
[2:42:23.420 --> 2:42:25.420]  realize that some of his earliest speeches
[2:42:25.420 --> 2:42:27.420]  Trump said, I'm
[2:42:27.420 --> 2:42:29.420]  I don't care if the globalists don't pay me
[2:42:29.420 --> 2:42:31.420]  and support me and help me become
[2:42:31.420 --> 2:42:33.420]  president. And he said, I don't care
[2:42:33.420 --> 2:42:35.420]  if the Koch brothers. No, I agree. I agree.
[2:42:35.420 --> 2:42:37.420]  Trump pushed their timetable up
[2:42:37.420 --> 2:42:39.420]  and got him behind. Let's talk about that
[2:42:39.420 --> 2:42:41.420]  and give Trump the praise he deserves on the other side
[2:42:41.420 --> 2:42:43.420]  and talk about solutions. And I want you to come back
[2:42:43.420 --> 2:42:45.420]  again, Dr. You're amazing. And again
[2:42:45.420 --> 2:42:47.420]  the website we are
[2:42:47.420 --> 2:42:49.420]  thepre.com
[2:42:49.420 --> 2:42:51.420]  the new book will be right back
[2:42:51.420 --> 2:42:53.420]  with our special guest and then the four
[2:42:53.420 --> 2:42:55.420]  tower is trade ahead as well.
[2:42:58.420 --> 2:43:00.420]  The purpose of fear is to call us
[2:43:00.420 --> 2:43:02.420]  into action and there is plenty to be
[2:43:02.420 --> 2:43:04.420]  afraid of today. Half the
[2:43:04.420 --> 2:43:06.420]  population has lined up for an untested,
[2:43:06.420 --> 2:43:08.420]  deadly and debilitating
[2:43:08.420 --> 2:43:10.420]  experimental injection because they were
[2:43:10.420 --> 2:43:12.420]  told to be afraid of an invisible
[2:43:12.420 --> 2:43:14.420]  asymptomatic disease. The perpetrators
[2:43:14.420 --> 2:43:16.420]  of all this have clearly stated
[2:43:16.420 --> 2:43:18.420]  their goal of having 80 percent of the
[2:43:18.420 --> 2:43:20.420]  population hooked up to an artificial
[2:43:20.420 --> 2:43:22.420]  intelligence hive mind in
[2:43:22.420 --> 2:43:24.420]  less than nine years. For those
[2:43:24.420 --> 2:43:26.420]  of us who have awoken from the spell,
[2:43:26.420 --> 2:43:28.420]  we know this is all really happening and
[2:43:28.420 --> 2:43:30.420]  it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[2:43:30.420 --> 2:43:32.420]  But there is only two things to do.
[2:43:32.420 --> 2:43:34.420]  We continue sounding the
[2:43:34.420 --> 2:43:36.420]  alarm because it's a numbers game.
[2:43:36.420 --> 2:43:38.420]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell
[2:43:38.420 --> 2:43:40.420]  then we win. But even when we
[2:43:40.420 --> 2:43:42.420]  win and we eventually will
[2:43:42.420 --> 2:43:44.420]  the days of convenience are soon coming
[2:43:44.420 --> 2:43:46.420]  to an end and so we must prepare
[2:43:46.420 --> 2:43:48.420]  get up to a years worth of
[2:43:48.420 --> 2:43:50.420]  storable foods, water filtration,
[2:43:50.420 --> 2:43:52.420]  survival gear, seeds,
[2:43:52.420 --> 2:43:54.420]  shortwave radios and
[2:43:54.420 --> 2:43:56.420]  life-saving knowledge at

[2:44:02.420 --> 2:44:04.420]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right
[2:44:04.420 --> 2:44:06.420]  thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[2:44:06.420 --> 2:44:08.420]  First of all let me say I
[2:44:08.420 --> 2:44:10.420]  love your products. I am a granny and
[2:44:10.420 --> 2:44:12.420]  for all the senior citizens
[2:44:12.420 --> 2:44:14.420]  out there that may have spent a lifetime
[2:44:14.420 --> 2:44:16.420]  in the sun like me, I was loaded up
[2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:18.420]  with sunspots or age spots
[2:44:18.420 --> 2:44:20.420]  as they're lovingly called but
[2:44:20.420 --> 2:44:22.420]  since taking your X2 for the last couple
[2:44:22.420 --> 2:44:24.420]  of years my skin is just really
[2:44:24.420 --> 2:44:26.420]  gorgeous actually. People think
[2:44:26.420 --> 2:44:28.420]  I'm 55 years old
[2:44:28.420 --> 2:44:30.420]  and I was already taking
[2:44:30.420 --> 2:44:32.420]  your other supplements but I thought, you know
[2:44:32.420 --> 2:44:34.420]  well maybe that's what I need to do
[2:44:34.420 --> 2:44:36.420]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[2:44:36.420 --> 2:44:38.420]  but when I started taking it
[2:44:38.420 --> 2:44:40.420]  I mean it doesn't happen immediately but
[2:44:40.420 --> 2:44:42.420]  you know over a period of time
[2:44:42.420 --> 2:44:44.420]  I started noticing, okay
[2:44:44.420 --> 2:44:46.420]  this is a ticket, this is working
[2:44:46.420 --> 2:44:48.420]  this is wonderful, you know
[2:44:48.420 --> 2:44:50.420]  I don't have to put on
[2:44:50.420 --> 2:44:52.420]  derma blend anymore, you know
[2:44:52.420 --> 2:44:54.420]  so anyway it worked wonderfully
[2:44:54.420 --> 2:45:22.420]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:45:24.420 --> 2:45:26.420]  This stuff lives in your septic system. It's really like probiotics

[2:47:29.060 --> 2:47:30.580]  I can't wait to read your book
[2:47:30.580 --> 2:47:35.620]  But in the ten and a half minutes. We've got 11 this segment. You've got the floor just let them have it with both barrels
[2:47:35.620 --> 2:47:39.500]  Or about what you think's happening. What's coming next and how we the people fight back?
[2:47:40.980 --> 2:47:42.980]  Well since the beginning of time
[2:47:43.620 --> 2:47:48.420]  Well really the beginning of as you and I both agree of villages towns
[2:47:48.900 --> 2:47:52.780]  The first big cities were about only 5,000 years ago
[2:47:53.460 --> 2:47:57.140]  So also new so in this very new era
[2:47:57.140 --> 2:48:03.500]  Humanity has been plagued by bullies essentially by people who want to control us and
[2:48:04.700 --> 2:48:06.700]  Struggle over
[2:48:06.860 --> 2:48:08.860]  Gradually has been for freedom
[2:48:08.860 --> 2:48:13.980]  And you know the Greeks experimented with freedom, but the first really big
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:19.060]  experimentation is described in the Bible and that is the the Jews
[2:48:19.060 --> 2:48:27.500]  my kinsfolk deciding to go free of slavery and being led free of slavery and
[2:48:28.020 --> 2:48:31.260]  a lot in that in that discussion is
[2:48:31.820 --> 2:48:33.820]  Warlike violent
[2:48:35.220 --> 2:48:39.220]  In a way that is actually typical of the time
[2:48:39.220 --> 2:48:48.580]  But it is about liberty and the symbol of the freedom of the Jews is very important in the American Revolution
[2:48:49.100 --> 2:48:54.540]  I was really surprised. I wrote a little book called while I'm an American and I look back on
[2:48:55.180 --> 2:48:58.780]  You know what the thinking was and it was all Judeo Christian
[2:48:58.780 --> 2:49:04.920]  It was both about the the liberation of the Jews and then about the about Jesus
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:12.160]  And then Jesus comes along and and for the first time he announces that the love love rules the world
[2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:14.940]  He does it more clearly than I feel testament does
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:17.640]  So one could argue with nuances
[2:49:18.040 --> 2:49:25.680]  But Jesus comes and he says with utter clarity, you know, you love love God and love one another as I love you
[2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:31.960]  He makes very very clear that love is what this world is about. It's not about the Roman Empire
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:37.680]  Which the Jews were fighting on and off during that period of time and he was a Jew
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:41.040]  So it's always been difficult
[2:49:41.040 --> 2:49:48.760]  But then there came the first real bright shining light in the world of government and that was the founding of America
[2:49:48.880 --> 2:49:53.480]  It was unique folks. It changed the world that began the democracies
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:57.400]  We see around the world and we are the first long-lived
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:50:03.920]  Democracy in the history of the world. There's nothing like us and now we have you said earlier
[2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:11.840]  That's why Schwab admits and they want to discredit it because that system threatens the the the neo-pagan tyranny. They want to set up
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.400]  That's right. It threatens the global bullies
[2:50:15.720 --> 2:50:17.800]  It's as simple as that
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:23.200]  We are the threat to the global bullies as long as America is strong and
[2:50:23.200 --> 2:50:27.360]  and honorable and really basing itself on
[2:50:27.720 --> 2:50:33.960]  Individual freedom is the beginning not the power of government but the government to defend individual freedom
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:37.620]  Which has been lost in our education and in our lives now
[2:50:38.280 --> 2:50:45.880]  But as long as we exist they can't do what they're doing and all they are doing is being predators on
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:49.040]  In the newest form of it
[2:50:49.040 --> 2:50:55.000]  So when we had clubs, they had clubs and spears and guns and now it's the technology
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:00.880]  It's the instilling fear. I think I should talk more about that
[2:51:00.880 --> 2:51:06.760]  My wife Ginger was the first very early in COVID to say this is the systematic
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:09.600]  installation of fear
[2:51:09.680 --> 2:51:15.160]  And then she brought me scientific articles great research. She said honey, they've got a whole
[2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:18.200]  scientific study
[2:51:18.200 --> 2:51:26.000]  In public health of instilling feet. I was about to say the British Ministry of Defense said our job is to terrorize the public
[2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:30.120]  No, God, and that that is that is it, you know
[2:51:30.120 --> 2:51:35.040]  I mean enormously in sync with it. We're exactly what what you're saying and
[2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:42.240]  That that's right and that is it and that's what Fauci does. He terrorizes he confuses
[2:51:42.240 --> 2:51:49.440]  He gives contradictory statements, but he's not the power. Everybody makes him out to be I mean, he's a man who's had
[2:51:49.440 --> 2:51:53.280]  You know he survived for presidents that that makes him a chameleon
[2:51:53.800 --> 2:51:57.560]  It makes it I agree doctor. So from your research, you know, what is it gates?
[2:51:57.560 --> 2:52:00.720]  I mean, who's I mean, obviously we can obsess over
[2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:04.280]  Well, I think as far as as far as we can go right now
[2:52:04.280 --> 2:52:08.040]  It's gates colluding with Fauci colluding with who oh God
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:14.480]  We haven't mentioned it colluding with communist China the ultimate power behind this is
[2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:16.880]  Communist China
[2:52:16.880 --> 2:52:21.080]  Communist China has been running who for decades. They weren't even the major
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:24.040]  Donator when Trump cut
[2:52:24.800 --> 2:52:32.040]  China or a who off for defending China lying about China and and letting China's literally
[2:52:32.040 --> 2:52:41.120]  Spread the disease around the world gates moved in and and started funding even more heavily who gates funds
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:44.120]  Who we've now counted through three separate?
[2:52:44.640 --> 2:52:50.480]  Organization, it's not just his own foundation. So I think that that's really where I need to get to
[2:52:51.440 --> 2:52:55.040]  Toward the toward the end here. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about that
[2:52:55.040 --> 2:53:01.720]  The the all of the predators are invested in China. I
[2:53:02.720 --> 2:53:04.720]  evaluated the top 15
[2:53:05.560 --> 2:53:11.040]  American billionaires they're all deeply invested in China with the possible exception of one
[2:53:11.160 --> 2:53:15.160]  They are none of them are patriots none of them believe in God
[2:53:15.320 --> 2:53:22.840]  They all look at China as superior to America gates has said it Fauci has said it the world health
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:32.120]  Organization and the UN is which is has a very active roles in sepi who is very active the UN is very active and
[2:53:33.160 --> 2:53:36.280]  That all leads back to China because the
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:38.600]  communists
[2:53:38.600 --> 2:53:44.760]  Basically run the UN and so that's the biggest ultimate threat we face right now
[2:53:44.760 --> 2:53:50.640]  And I'm glad we finally got to that now the thing that gates doesn't realize and Fauci doesn't realize is
[2:53:50.640 --> 2:53:56.600]  Once they empower China if they keep empowering China to win over us
[2:53:56.600 --> 2:53:59.840]  They've been doing it at conferences another occasion
[2:53:59.840 --> 2:54:07.280]  I'll talk to you about the conferences being held by people like Michael Bloomberg and and cloud Schwab and
[2:54:07.640 --> 2:54:13.080]  How they bring in the Chinese and co-sponsor with the Chinese communists the communists
[2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:16.320]  I'm glad you're showing the some of the pictures of this and
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:23.200]  And that that's the ultimate enemy, but what China is going to do when it does
[2:54:23.680 --> 2:54:27.840]  Have its empire and it is trying folks to build an empire
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:29.760]  We're the main people in the way
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:37.160]  They've just about destroyed Australia now with the covert totalitarianism because Australia is part of the southern route
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:42.480]  To get to the Western world and then to dominate us once they dominate the world
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:48.800]  They'll they'll they'll eat Bill Gates like he's a hot dog. I mean Bill Gates
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:54.800]  We're forced to be just one more slave or he'll be done with same with Fauci just like that Ali Baba exactly
[2:54:55.240 --> 2:55:00.320]  Exactly gates that only operates they came out of a free society. They're getting rid of the very thing they live on
[2:55:00.840 --> 2:55:07.960]  Oh, it's that is so true. And now I'm a psychiatrist, but I tell you something. I can't explain such craziness
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:10.320]  It is it is really
[2:55:10.320 --> 2:55:14.240]  Beyond let me ask you this. What do you make of Gates when he talks about?
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:20.800]  Starvation and collapse he starts giggling and getting really excited like in every video very sickening
[2:55:21.600 --> 2:55:24.960]  It's very very sickening. I kind of when I envisioned Bill Gates
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:31.120]  I envision a ten-year-old in short pants that suddenly comes to run the world
[2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:37.680]  To rule the world and he gets a he gets kicks and giggles and he gets uncomfortable
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:42.880]  But he keeps hinting that we could do with less people ha ha and things like that
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:51.200]  And of course his family comes from up from deep population control as his dad was deeply involved in abortion
[2:55:52.640 --> 2:55:56.760]  Absolutely doc you got to come back again. I want to read your book. We love you
[2:55:56.760 --> 2:56:00.780]  We appreciate been watching all your videos in a minute and a half closing comments here doc
[2:56:01.520 --> 2:56:03.520]  It's time to stand up folks
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:07.280]  we have not got forever to save America and
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:13.560]  Alex Jones is has been forever one of the great leader leading up to this time
[2:56:13.560 --> 2:56:20.400]  I mean everything he's been saying for very long time leads to this time. Don't get overwhelmed get together
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:24.280]  Don't get overwhelmed have more love for this world
[2:56:24.280 --> 2:56:31.800]  We have for God for nature for your family and remember we are fighting forces that hate us
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:35.680]  They call us deplorables. They think of us as
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:41.520]  Outside the realm. They're the elite. They genuinely all think they're the elite
[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:46.360]  They're kind of an incompatible elite, but there won't be any great war among them
[2:56:46.360 --> 2:56:51.880]  The Chinese communists will rule the world. So we really need to put ourselves together
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:58.720]  We need to be refunders of the country and we need to be inspired to know that that
[2:56:58.720 --> 2:57:06.880]  We are honored. We are honored to live at a key time in the history of the world and as Alex beautifully said
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:09.200]  If we turn it around
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:11.560]  We will make a huge
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:17.080]  Distifference in what happens ahead of our time. So so join us folks find your way
[2:57:17.560 --> 2:57:22.440]  Join to join join at the board of education join at the local Republican

[2:58:44.240 --> 2:58:47.960]  Alex you've got so many great products, and we're just really proud of the work you're doing Mike
[2:58:49.240 --> 2:58:53.840]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds
[2:58:53.840 --> 2:58:58.480]  I was overweight I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:01.320]  And I heard dr. Group on your show and I listened to it
[2:59:01.320 --> 2:59:05.640]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield the X1 and it worked pretty good
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:09.640]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that to you have you know with a deep burden source
[2:59:09.640 --> 2:59:13.160]  You know and I got really excited about that so I took it and then in two weeks
[2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:18.120]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened
[2:59:18.120 --> 2:59:24.080]  You know I could think again I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years
[2:59:24.080 --> 2:59:30.240]  I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements
[2:59:30.240 --> 2:59:35.400]  The one I like recently is knockout literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works
[2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:38.160]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[2:59:38.160 --> 2:59:44.120]  That's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[2:59:44.120 --> 2:59:47.560]  Beautifully said brother. I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed
[2:59:47.560 --> 3:00:07.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show

[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:09.520]  So I love you listeners, but I hope you realize how historic
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:17.320]  The moment is we're in because I could have spent the whole show with images of Afghans falling off airplanes and
[3:02:17.640 --> 3:02:22.440]  Suicide bombers and blood everywhere and that's an important story. I'm gonna come into Marantep a whole show
[3:02:22.440 --> 3:02:25.440]  Probably four hours long and two hours of it
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:31.400]  I intend to be all about that and and the drug dealing and why the globalists did it and in all of it and
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:39.360]  Some other special guests that'll probably hear about five o'clock tomorrow because today's live, but I'm gonna I'm gonna start taping at noon tomorrow, so I
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:41.600]  Look for that
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:44.520]  But that's not a side issue. It's important
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:52.240]  But the biological war on us and these poison inoculations and all these governments ordering five six seven years of
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:59.080]  Inoculations out admitting it's not gonna work and admitting. It's all a trap to take control of our bodies. That's the big issue
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:02.160]  That's giant
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:06.440]  That's historic. That's huge and that's why we're on air
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:12.640]  At this historic point right now look at these headlines endless shots Canada disordered
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:18.960]  Seven doses of COVID vaccines for every man woman and child. It's not stopping. It's just ramping up
[3:03:19.680 --> 3:03:24.080]  And of course the Israeli study 13 times better to have natural immunity
[3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:29.400]  But they don't care because they have the surgeon general up there in his admiral outfit
[3:03:30.760 --> 3:03:36.480]  Telling you that you must submit to this system
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:44.420]  And of course we had Ashley Babbitt's husband on we had to sit there and watch her killer on TV last night
[3:03:44.760 --> 3:03:50.440]  Say I'd do it again, and I'm a hero and I saved countless lives from an unarmed woman
[3:03:51.240 --> 3:03:56.080]  You're like why are they doing this because they're getting you used to being enslaved?
[3:03:56.480 --> 3:04:02.560]  They're trying to break your will. Don't let them break your will just like our last guess
[3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:05.720]  Just said
[3:04:05.720 --> 3:04:10.480]  This is a historic time to be alive like dr. Reagan said
[3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:12.960]  And
[3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:21.720]  So we should be blessed to be alive right now. This is an incredible time to be here defending the Republic against real enemies
[3:04:22.400 --> 3:04:24.360]  Who don't even have a military or police?
[3:04:24.360 --> 3:04:28.680]  They've just got propaganda and lies and if you wake up with their lies and their propaganda
[3:04:28.680 --> 3:04:36.600]  They can and will be defeated, but it is a spiritual war. It is psychological war
[3:04:37.400 --> 3:04:38.680]  All right
[3:04:38.680 --> 3:04:46.240]  Stupiders of stupiders dot TV is taken over and then Owen shroyer if he's not in federal court
[3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:50.240]  We'll be back in 55 minutes from now
[3:04:50.240 --> 3:05:00.100]  He's in federal court right now. Oh, I'm shroyer today 3 p.m. The war room. It's always critical
[3:05:00.100 --> 3:05:05.040]  It's always vital. It's always essential to have enough high-quality vitamins and minerals in your body
[3:05:05.040 --> 3:05:08.840]  That's why essential vitamins and minerals are called essential. You must have them
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  But in today's crazy times it is more important than ever to stay on top of it
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:18.040]  And the vitamin mineral fusion has been sold out for months and months and months
[3:05:18.040 --> 3:05:21.480]  It's got all the essential vitamins and minerals and amino acids. It is

[3:05:58.720 --> 3:06:17.200]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's Alex Jones
[3:06:21.840 --> 3:06:27.680]  Talked about absolutely 100% dead on as he always is. I mean
[3:06:27.680 --> 3:06:34.720]  The tinfoil hat of Alex Jones should be traded in immediately for an excellence in truthful broadcasting award
[3:06:35.440 --> 3:06:39.280]  As the predictions that have been made on this platform for years
[3:06:40.160 --> 3:06:42.160]  Are now coming to fruition
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:47.920]  And it is historically a great time to be alive. I don't want to be a fatalist here
[3:06:48.640 --> 3:06:50.640]  But it would appear that we are losing
[3:06:51.360 --> 3:06:56.800]  Some of our law enforcement. We are losing the military. I mean look at Millie this guy ought to just dye his hair pink
[3:06:56.800 --> 3:07:04.080]  Become the purple-headed crackpot and join and Tifa himself and as far as the police are concerned
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:07.600]  We're going to talk about an arrest that was made in Florida in a little while
[3:07:08.480 --> 3:07:13.920]  But I just got confirmation from a very reliable source of mine. I mean this text is coming in right now
[3:07:14.880 --> 3:07:17.280]  Got confirmation from local health departments
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:21.680]  They were briefed on the shielding approach by the Ohio Department of Health
[3:07:22.240 --> 3:07:24.240]  Which is given by the cdc
[3:07:24.240 --> 3:07:30.480]  A parental revolution is starting. However, when speaking to the schools, they admitted that they do see this coming
[3:07:31.440 --> 3:07:34.320]  547 kids in one school are quarantined
[3:07:35.040 --> 3:07:37.280]  Parents are sending their kids to school not caring
[3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:43.200]  The schools stated they will use the police to force to take the kids back home
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:51.840]  When asking about vaccination coming for the kids, they said they would be in fact making it mandatory once allowed by the fba
[3:07:51.840 --> 3:07:57.440]  And parents who remove their kids will be met with truance officers
[3:07:58.800 --> 3:08:04.240]  If parents do not quarantine their children the cdc will enact the shielding approach. It's coming
[3:08:06.160 --> 3:08:13.440]  The tyranny that we are being conditioned for the slavery that we are being conditioned for with police being mobilized against
[3:08:13.920 --> 3:08:17.360]  law-abiding citizens in countries all over the globe
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:20.960]  We oftentimes reference places like australia
[3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:23.760]  We talk about the uk
[3:08:23.760 --> 3:08:27.280]  We look at canada these are testing grounds
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:31.920]  For what these globalist oligarchs are going to implement here in the united states
[3:08:31.920 --> 3:08:37.840]  The only thing stopping them is our second amendment, which is why the second amendment is under attack and i have to caution you
[3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:45.920]  When you are watching young and healthy military aged afghanis pour into this country completely unchecked
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:53.520]  We are being set up for timothy mcvay type events to take place all over this country
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:08:59.440]  We are setting up for the opportunity with it with an open border at our south
[3:09:00.400 --> 3:09:06.480]  And we know that it's not just mexicans coming in here. We know that it's just not latinos from south america coming in here
[3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:14.960]  What we know is that this thing is open to people coming from places like pakistan people coming from places like afghanistan
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:17.120]  radicalized
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:19.920]  jihadists are coming into this country
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:22.800]  at nauseam and it would be
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:30.320]  Realistic and reasonable to suspect that there are dirty bombs rocket launchers rpgs and all kinds of weaponry already
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:32.960]  Cashed here in the united states
[3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:39.200]  And there are cells strategically placed all over this country ready to rise up
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:43.200]  and implement these attacks to then
[3:09:44.320 --> 3:09:48.960]  Give the power to this biden administration, which many believe to be completely illegitimate
[3:09:50.640 --> 3:09:55.520]  That was prepared on day one with an historically unprecedented amount of executive action and orders
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:00.720]  Ready to reverse the efforts and initiative of president donald j trump and as a result
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:05.280]  We are watching the most rapid totalitarian power grab the world has ever seen
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:10.320]  But you don't have to go all the way down under and look at the tyranny happening in australia
[3:10:11.440 --> 3:10:13.440]  Right to our north in canada. It's happening
[3:10:13.920 --> 3:10:18.960]  chris sky joins us now. He has been arrested two times in the last two days
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:23.680]  Two times in the last two days for thought crimes
[3:10:24.880 --> 3:10:26.880]  And he's with us chris. Tell us what's going on
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:32.880]  Hey guys, how are you happy to be here? So, yeah, you're not lying. I did get arrested twice in the last two days
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:39.280]  I'm actually currently now on six separate bales all with their own types of conditions
[3:10:39.600 --> 3:10:43.760]  Things like not being able to drive not being able to fly not being able to speak at certain places
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:46.080]  Having to have a bale surety
[3:10:46.320 --> 3:10:50.720]  Not being able to possess any weapons. They've confiscated all my legally owned firearms
[3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:53.200]  And if anybody remembers bay back in may
[3:10:53.200 --> 3:10:58.000]  I was the first person in the history of canada to get charged with a preemptive warrant for something they said
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:10:59.840]  I was going to do
[3:10:59.840 --> 3:11:01.760]  Which was speak at an event
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:05.920]  So they got a warrant in advance to try and arrest me and when I didn't show up to the event
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:09.120]  Uh, I wasn't sure not if the warrant had been rescinded
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:12.160]  So I was coming back through the same area just a couple days ago
[3:11:12.160 --> 3:11:14.880]  Which was winnipeg manitoba on my way to ontario
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:20.880]  So I had my lawyer call on august 23rd and verify with multiple police officers and multiple police departments that I had
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:24.720]  No warrants for my arrest anywhere in the country, especially in manitoba
[3:11:25.040 --> 3:11:29.120]  That night they decided to do a flash rally the very next morning because I was in town
[3:11:29.360 --> 3:11:34.480]  And we had a few hundred people show up on us on a dime and then sure enough somehow
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:40.800]  They came and arrested me and said I had a warrant and we identified the fact that the warrant just appeared on the computer
[3:11:41.280 --> 3:11:45.840]  Literally at the exact moment I was speaking and they backdated it to a few months ago
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:50.320]  Yet it wasn't on the computer just the day before so we're witnessing real-time
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:57.440]  Tyranny communist style corruption where they literally can just manufacture a fake warrant back data to whatever they want
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:01.200]  So they can illegally arrest somebody and when they did arrest me and I I told them
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:04.480]  I knew exactly what they were doing and I had made preparations like warrant get
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:09.440]  Documentation in advance. They literally treated me like a political prisoner. It's basically torturing me
[3:12:09.680 --> 3:12:11.680]  They took off my shoes and socks
[3:12:11.680 --> 3:12:16.640]  They tried to force me to wear a mask which I wouldn't do so they put a handable electric style spit hood on me
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:19.920]  And they just gave me really poor treatment compared to everybody else there
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:23.520]  They had to let me go because obviously everything is fraudulent and they're going to be
[3:12:23.920 --> 3:12:27.840]  Answering for it in a number of ways and then less than 12 hours later
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:33.360]  I was driving home with my wife and z the the gentleman who bailed me out
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:37.840]  And we pulled over so z could pray and when he was praying
[3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:42.000]  Uh some cops showed up about four cops eight four cop cars eight cops
[3:12:42.240 --> 3:12:45.440]  And they arrested me because they said somebody said I pushed my wife
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:49.200]  And they've already taken virtually every one of my rights and freedoms away
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:54.560]  The only thing I still have is my friends and family and they tried to force me to sign a form 10 release form
[3:12:54.560 --> 3:12:57.200]  That said I wouldn't be able to communicate or live with my wife
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:01.920]  And when I wouldn't sign that they kept me overnight in jail and had to wait for another bail hearing in the morning
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:06.240]  Just so I could get out of jail now with new charges of assault on my wife
[3:13:06.240 --> 3:13:11.360]  When my wife vehemently denies this the cameras at the gas station vehemently deny this
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:15.680]  But because some random person called the police with some hearsay that was enough to arrest me
[3:13:15.920 --> 3:13:21.520]  So that's what's going on in canada and why it's because I've been predicting exactly what's going to happen for the last two years
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:27.280]  And now it's gotten to the point where the vacs pass is the thing that's going to unite the country together against the government
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:30.160]  Whether vaccinated or not people do not like the vac pass
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:33.840]  So when I go around telling people this is what's going to happen in the next few months
[3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:37.360]  Especially the vaccinated because they're the ones that believe getting backs would get them out of this
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:40.880]  In reality, this is canada's future and the us isn't far behind
[3:13:41.280 --> 3:13:46.640]  Justin Trudeau wins the election in september. Justin Trudeau locks us down the vaccinated start getting sick
[3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:50.080]  They blame it on a new variant. They blame the new variant on the unvaccinated
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:54.800]  They used as an excuse to implement the vaccine passport on all of us. That's our future
[3:13:54.880 --> 3:13:56.880]  We're not going to be able to change that in the short term
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:00.480]  But if you warn everybody about that when it actually happens
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:06.320]  You're going to bring more people vaccinated and non-vaccinated on the side of the fence of freedom against the vacs pass
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:09.520]  And if people think that it's not it's a fruitless opposition
[3:14:09.760 --> 3:14:14.720]  We already have created groups in british columbia for businesses against the vaccine passport
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:22.560]  And there's almost 80,000 businesses already within a week that signed into that group saying that they will not enforce the vaccine passport
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:29.520]  So ladies and gentlemen, I'll be clear the vaccine passport is their big push to implement tyranny if we allow it to stand
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:35.920]  And uh, that's our rights and freedoms that people fought and died for gone for good and now government granted privileges
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:41.760]  That's why they're not satisfied with 75 of the population in ontario canada. We're on from they just released new guidelines
[3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:44.240]  They want 100 of the adults
[3:14:45.120 --> 3:14:48.880]  It vaccinated and 90 of all canadians vaccinated
[3:14:48.880 --> 3:14:55.520]  Which means they're going to start vaccinating children under 12 to meet these so-called thresholds for herd immunity that they're literally making up
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:15:00.400]  And if you don't think that they're coming for you and for your kids, you're absolutely wrong
[3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:06.960]  We've seen these tyrannical school boards as they have this presumed power that came from only god knows where
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:12.080]  Uh, but they these pseudo aristocrats that rule over you and your children
[3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:17.920]  And then as the elitist oligarchs that they are complete hypocrisy go and do something completely different
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:23.600]  But the fact that you were arrested in the middle of nowhere just minutes after a so-called passerby
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:29.600]  Happened to witness you allegedly pushing or hitting your wife and the cops just happen to be staged in the area
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:35.760]  Not one of them not two of them but ten of them and then treated you like a political prisoner is reminiscent of everything that happened
[3:15:36.000 --> 3:15:39.920]  On the 6th of january here and it's exactly what's going to happen in the times to come
[3:15:40.240 --> 3:15:42.560]  Chris sky, thank you so much for being here. We really appreciate it
[3:15:43.280 --> 3:15:50.400]  More on the alex jones show as we continue here momentarily and i gotta tell you there is a story coming out of minnesota right now
[3:15:50.400 --> 3:15:56.640]  Uh a school board member just demonstrating this Pelosi type hypocrisy. We're gonna get to that coming up next don't go anywhere

[3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:12.160]  That has come together over the years and is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed and thankful
[3:19:12.560 --> 3:19:16.640]  For all of you the listeners of this show. I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you
[3:19:17.040 --> 3:19:19.840]  Whether you are old whether you are Hispanic white black
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:23.840]  It doesn't matter you got red blood and if you love freedom and justice and if you love
[3:19:23.840 --> 3:19:28.640]  Our innocent children and we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been
[3:19:29.120 --> 3:19:35.120]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years and as crazy your things are I want to keep working into the future
[3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:38.320]  But again, that's really up to you and up to god
[3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:43.760]  So please I hope god works through you and and put some messages in your heart to support us
[3:19:44.160 --> 3:19:46.320]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with god
[3:19:46.320 --> 3:19:50.320]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done
[3:19:50.320 --> 3:19:54.400]  And just ask you again to pray to god and ask what god's vision is for you
[3:19:54.800 --> 3:19:58.320]  And hopefully god will touch your heart to continue to support him for worse. God bless
[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:04.640]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:04.640 --> 3:20:22.960]  The most rapid totalitarian power grab the world has ever seen i'm going to continue referring to that
[3:20:24.560 --> 3:20:26.400]  Because we have been
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:29.360]  Lulled to sleep and complacent over several decades
[3:20:29.360 --> 3:20:35.280]  We've never had a fair media and now it's new media people that were formerly conspiracy theorists
[3:20:35.840 --> 3:20:37.840]  radical right-wing extremists
[3:20:38.240 --> 3:20:43.600]  That are the only ones left to bring you honest news as a result of that oh and shroyers and federal court right now
[3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:47.360]  Hopefully he'll be here in time to bring the war room next hour
[3:20:48.240 --> 3:20:50.000]  alex jones has been
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:54.800]  Vindicated after being trashed by every mainstream media outlet
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:21:01.440]  That really accessible or known to man and we think to ourselves well boy this this media is really corrupt and they've really gone after trump
[3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  We have never had a fair media
[3:21:04.880 --> 3:21:09.520]  And when the media continues to be the machine to prop up the conservative ink
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:17.120]  You know mainstream politicians, you know who they are out here fundraising talking about issues rather than coming up with problem
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:21.840]  Solutions which they never want to do because it ends and cuts off their funding
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:27.600]  And the great awakening is also responsible for a great deal of pain. It is causing
[3:21:28.640 --> 3:21:32.160]  Serious problems in people's homes at the dinner tables in marriages
[3:21:32.720 --> 3:21:36.000]  Relationships people are not talking to their own brothers and sisters anymore
[3:21:36.240 --> 3:21:42.560]  I was in front of a group of roughly 200 nurses at a church last night in rochester, minnesota not far from the male clinic
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:44.560]  And that's where these people work
[3:21:44.560 --> 3:21:50.800]  And the amount of anxiety and stress that these health care workers are dealing with for so many reasons
[3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:56.880]  They're dealing with the fact that they know they're awake a certain group of them to exactly what it is that's going on
[3:21:56.880 --> 3:22:01.680]  But yet they're being asked to implement treatment like remdesivir and ventilators when they know
[3:22:02.080 --> 3:22:06.720]  That it should be quercetin or zinc heavy loads of vitamin d and c ivermectin and so on
[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:10.240]  Could save these lives of these people
[3:22:11.680 --> 3:22:17.520]  The military is openly recruiting internment specialists. The cdc is publishing about green zones
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:20.720]  I would encourage you to go look right at the cdc's website
[3:22:22.240 --> 3:22:24.160]  We can't be here
[3:22:24.160 --> 3:22:27.840]  To do all of this on our own you don't have to take our word for it
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:33.120]  We can guide you but you have to see it for yourself and then encourage your neighbors your church congregation
[3:22:33.680 --> 3:22:35.360]  everybody around you
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:41.360]  To wake up and see it for themselves so that they can truly understand what we are looking at as we look around the world
[3:22:41.360 --> 3:22:44.320]  We've talked to people in australia. We've talked to people in canada like chris sky
[3:22:44.320 --> 3:22:49.920]  But it's happening here in the united states as people are being conditioned and now they're targeting your kids
[3:22:50.560 --> 3:22:56.320]  Breaking today for example at national file.com a minnesota school board member called jennifer keiser tiff
[3:22:57.120 --> 3:23:00.480]  voted to force children to wear oxygen inhibiting
[3:23:01.440 --> 3:23:02.720]  masks of
[3:23:02.720 --> 3:23:04.480]  psychological destruction
[3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:11.840]  And then the very next day was caught unmasked at a concert with nearly 10 000 people in attendance
[3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:17.440]  The author of that article from national file is andrew white. He joins us now as a young patriot with the heart of a lion
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:23.200]  You've been pummeling this false narrative and all of this propaganda with bombshell reports at national file
[3:23:23.520 --> 3:23:27.520]  And you're right outside of the dc swamp. You're based there exposing this tyranny
[3:23:28.080 --> 3:23:30.080]  Right from the belly of the beast
[3:23:30.080 --> 3:23:34.160]  What is going on with people like this tiff? What exactly happened here?
[3:23:36.560 --> 3:23:40.000]  Well glad to be back stew. It's been a while since we last spoke, but yeah
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:42.480]  So this woman jennifer tiff
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:46.160]  She went on this entire tirade during this
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:49.200]  special school board meeting on august 23rd
[3:23:49.760 --> 3:23:51.760]  And pathetically
[3:23:51.760 --> 3:23:52.800]  Disgracefully
[3:23:52.800 --> 3:23:56.720]  Hypocritically went through this concert in red rock, colorado
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:01.760]  The guy she went to go see with her with her family or friends or whoever it was
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:04.560]  Was nithaniel rate lift in the night's let's sort
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:09.040]  The red rocks amphitheater in colorado so in this report by a westward
[3:24:09.040 --> 3:24:12.640]  Hey, they said the venue was packed and in the photos that I got of her
[3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:17.280]  She is standing around no mask on no slave mask on her freedom
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:21.680]  She can wear no slave mask for her around thousands and thousands of people
[3:24:22.080 --> 3:24:24.480]  Disgusting stuff listening to that
[3:24:24.960 --> 3:24:30.000]  Excruciatingly insane stuff. They're saying on this school board meeting
[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:35.600]  It just it blows my mind the hubris of these people. They really think that they are are overlords
[3:24:35.600 --> 3:24:39.840]  Disguised they and and I was watching the video of this meeting on youtube
[3:24:40.400 --> 3:24:42.400]  And I was hearing her say things like
[3:24:42.960 --> 3:24:46.560]  We have to realize that we have to be able to sacrifice our freedom
[3:24:47.360 --> 3:24:51.760]  For the safety of our community for the safety of our children
[3:24:52.240 --> 3:24:56.240]  And she appeared to be just also frightened and also scared of this
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:24:58.560]  Virus the world-ending plague
[3:24:59.040 --> 3:25:03.120]  Well, she made this seemingly incredibly difficult decision
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:06.720]  That she had to weigh about and she really had to think about so hard
[3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:09.600]  And then ultimately rules that yep
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:15.200]  We feel that for the safety of the community and for our kids. We just have to forgo certain freedoms
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:18.000]  We have to lock down. We have to stay responsible
[3:25:18.560 --> 3:25:21.040]  And then in turn your children
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:24.640]  Despite the science despite their proven ineffectiveness
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:30.000]  Despite the overwhelming long-term psychological damage that this thing is doing to kids
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:34.800]  We've all seen the viral picture of the kids walking like zombies down the hallway as they wear a mask and a social distance
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:37.200]  She votes for this
[3:25:37.200 --> 3:25:41.520]  And saying all those things then in turn goes and sits with tens of thousands of people
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:47.920]  Hypocrisy all day long. We see it with Nancy Pelosi as she's waited on by her masked up brown faced servants
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:55.040]  And she sits unmasked with the rest of her crowd. We see Barack Obama's birthday bash with thousands of people and now this
[3:25:55.040 --> 3:26:00.400]  Jennifer Kaiser tipped in minnesota. So other than the blatant hypocrisy in about a minute and a half
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:07.840]  What do you think it is that we are really looking at here? What is the root cause of all of this hypocrisy?
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:12.960]  Well, really they've deified the ruling class
[3:26:13.280 --> 3:26:16.800]  Despite all their flaws, which we all know about
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:19.280]  Despite all the evil that they perpetuate
[3:26:19.280 --> 3:26:25.200]  Um, this kind of tendency for control emanated by our ruling elite the globalist in power
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:31.120]  Is now kind of being replicated on a smaller scale at the local level and it's becoming a real problem
[3:26:31.600 --> 3:26:34.160]  and you know, I just want to make a point that
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:37.280]  She thinks that she can get away with this
[3:26:37.520 --> 3:26:42.160]  She thinks that no one's going to see no one's going to notice that you can just do this to children
[3:26:42.400 --> 3:26:45.760]  With all the damages that it's doing and you just have this impunity
[3:26:45.760 --> 3:26:51.520]  Like Nancy Pelosi does like Barack Obama does you think you can do this? No, you're gonna get exposed
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:54.480]  You're gonna get called out and you're gonna be removed
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:26:58.080]  And I think that it is on
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:04.320]  The shoulders of the parents in communities like this that after something like this is exposed
[3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:07.520]  That something gets done with it for far too long
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:13.360]  We have been complacent and it's past time that Americans actually demand that
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:19.760]  That Americans actually demand the removal of somebody like this. I would suspect and real quickly
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:22.640]  I'll just get your opinion on this. You've written stories like this in the past
[3:27:22.960 --> 3:27:26.960]  I would suspect that you would think that somebody like Jennifer Kaiser tiffed would be
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:31.440]  More than likely resigning at this point. The whole board should probably resign your thoughts
[3:27:33.040 --> 3:27:38.640]  I think she absolutely should resign and disgrace because what she did was disgusting and it's so evident
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:44.080]  It's so evident the hypocrisy on a whole nother level. These people are living in an entirely different world
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:45.360]  I swear to god
[3:27:45.360 --> 3:27:50.800]  It's like something has literally come within the hearts and minds of these people where they think this kind of stuff
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:55.280]  Is going to be permitted, but as we've noted it's not it's not and we're not going to take it
[3:27:56.800 --> 3:28:00.400]  Andrew white, thank you so much for being here. You're doing a great job over at national file
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:04.000]  Good job exposing this. Look at all those people. Look at all of those people
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:08.800]  Uh, we were looking at her social media. We see all the lgbtq postings all of her
[3:28:09.360 --> 3:28:14.080]  Encouragement to associate with minorities. I see a lot of white faces there too with her largely
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:19.040]  White group of friends and her husband there really enjoying their white privilege
[3:28:19.040 --> 3:28:26.160]  Well, they tell everybody else to do exactly the opposite strap up become enslaved get used to it
[3:28:26.560 --> 3:28:30.880]  Put your kid in this muzzle. Don't argue it. It doesn't matter what you say
[3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:37.840]  A peer reviewed journals do not matter stats do not matter data doesn't matter the opinions of experts does not matter
[3:28:38.160 --> 3:28:43.840]  The findings on doctors in waterloo at waterloo university and the experts there those studies
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:50.240]  None of that matters put this mask on go get injected sit down shut up obey
[3:28:50.720 --> 3:28:52.480]  While I go live like this
[3:28:52.480 --> 3:28:57.520]  Andrew white national file. Thank you so much for being here more of the alex joneshow continues with me stew peters right after this
[3:28:57.520 --> 3:29:04.720]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational
[3:29:05.200 --> 3:29:10.560]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover
[3:29:10.640 --> 3:29:15.920]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades
[3:29:16.160 --> 3:29:19.760]  To get ready for this to be able to find it off humanity is strong
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:22.880]  We're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:25.920]  We have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance
[3:29:25.920 --> 3:29:33.280]  We will defeat it. So prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential
[3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:40.880]  And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:48.000]  And they're also funding our operation info wars store.com info wars store.com is incredible
[3:29:48.160 --> 3:29:52.240]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies

[3:29:59.040 --> 3:30:03.280]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds
[3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:08.000]  I was overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job
[3:30:08.240 --> 3:30:10.720]  And I heard dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it
[3:30:10.800 --> 3:30:15.120]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good
[3:30:15.280 --> 3:30:17.520]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that too
[3:30:17.520 --> 3:30:22.720]  You know with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that. So I took it and man in two weeks
[3:30:22.800 --> 3:30:29.040]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again
[3:30:29.120 --> 3:30:33.600]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years
[3:30:33.680 --> 3:30:39.680]  I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements
[3:30:39.760 --> 3:30:44.400]  The one I like recently is knockout. It literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:47.600]  It works. But anyways, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[3:30:47.680 --> 3:30:50.080]  We have to break free of the globalist system
[3:30:50.080 --> 3:30:53.680]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand
[3:30:53.760 --> 3:30:57.040]  Beautifully said brother. I thank you so much for your call and godspeed
[3:30:58.800 --> 3:31:02.240]  Humanity is the main stakeholder on this planet
[3:31:02.880 --> 3:31:06.000]  But the big corporations for a hundred years have told us that humans are bad and evil
[3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:10.720]  And a pestilence on the earth so that we begin to believe we're bad and we'll turn off our life force
[3:31:10.720 --> 3:31:14.320]  And let the eugenics based globalists take control of the planet
[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:18.080]  If you let a clown swab the evidence groups own wikipedia page
[3:31:18.560 --> 3:31:26.640]  He brags on there about how they're capturing democracy and taking over governments worldwide to set up a corporate dictatorship under the un
[3:31:26.960 --> 3:31:31.920]  They admit all of this. They plan the lockdowns. They release the viruses
[3:31:31.920 --> 3:31:40.080]  They think you're stupid and their plan is to slowly cut off the resources so they can dictate total social control over you and your lives
[3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:43.120]  That's how I was able to predict everything they did
[3:31:43.760 --> 3:31:50.960]  Decades before they executed it word for word with total precision because they have a detailed battle plan
[3:31:51.200 --> 3:31:58.080]  We cover it live weekdays 11 a.m. Is 3 p.m. At info wars.com fort slash show tell everybody to tune in now and war the world

[3:33:01.840 --> 3:33:04.480]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:04.480 --> 3:33:20.880]  Looking at the website right there stu peters dot tv the first headline that you will note is senior trump hhs
[3:33:20.960 --> 3:33:26.000]  Covid advisor drops bombs task force misled potas no pandemic what that is
[3:33:26.640 --> 3:33:31.280]  Is that is dr paul e alexander and he joined me earlier today?
[3:33:31.280 --> 3:33:37.520]  To discuss whether or not the coronavirus task force meaning vice president mike pence
[3:33:38.160 --> 3:33:42.880]  Tony fauci dr berks you remember all these people that were on television
[3:33:43.280 --> 3:33:46.640]  This thing was over in china and if you remember
[3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:52.000]  Back then for any of you that were still tuning into fox news just holding on to
[3:33:52.560 --> 3:33:58.720]  Any belief at all just a shred of belief whatsoever that these people were still for you before they just went out and out
[3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:05.520]  Propaganda communist tyrants criminally complicit media sold out to the to the deep state cabal and to the ccp
[3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:10.960]  They are the propaganda arm of jijin ping and his deep state there now
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:18.000]  We know that but you remember if you were still watching then that we saw this thing being so-called isolated there
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:20.400]  And that they were battling it in china
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:26.800]  What you don't know or maybe you do is that tens of millions of people out of the billions in population in china? They're dead
[3:34:26.800 --> 3:34:32.960]  Uh, they're dead and the reason why they this murder for money complicity is happening here with these doctors
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:34.560]  We're going to get to that in just a moment
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:41.600]  But there's all sorts of confusing rhetoric happening where trump's base is very concerned about his speak around these
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:46.160]  So-called vaccines these shots being falsely referred to as vaccines and this
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:48.640]  Incessant push like we've never seen
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:53.040]  Despite the fact that over four times the amount of people that died on 9 11
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:56.560]  That anniversary coming up shortly, and we will never forget that day
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:34:59.360]  over four times
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:02.720]  The amount of people have died and that is only according
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:08.320]  To one cdc monitored website called the vaccine adverse events reporting system
[3:35:09.120 --> 3:35:11.120]  We know that only one percent
[3:35:11.760 --> 3:35:15.440]  Of the real data actually appears there due to a harvard study
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:21.520]  We know now that there are 11 other systems that track vaccine injuries and deaths
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:23.520]  That we can't look at
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:30.480]  Why why can't we look at them because we know and we can speculate that the amount of injury and death
[3:35:31.280 --> 3:35:36.640]  As a result even if you only look at the 13,000. This is the most deadly incident on u.s. soil
[3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:42.800]  More than the 1900 galveston cyclone the hurricane that killed anywhere between five and 12 000 people
[3:35:43.440 --> 3:35:49.200]  More than who perished on 9 11 more people than died in the titanic more people than died in the attack on pearl harbour
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:55.200]  These are events that will eternally be written about in history in history history books
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:36:02.000]  And here we are with a vaccine rollout of what five months now this thing has been out
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:07.360]  And now supposedly approved by the fda, but there is a slight of hand here
[3:36:07.760 --> 3:36:09.760]  Which is why we're going to talk to dr. Jane ruby now
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:16.880]  Dr. Jane you have appeared on the stupider show multiple times as we have tried to make sense of this fda approval
[3:36:16.880 --> 3:36:20.080]  Karen Kingston is a former fizer employee
[3:36:20.640 --> 3:36:24.320]  She's a pharmaceutical marketing person a biotech analyst
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:30.480]  Dr. Malone is the so-called inventor of the mrna technology that is used in these shots
[3:36:31.360 --> 3:36:38.480]  Dr. Sherry tenpenny a very brave doctor that is outspoken and has been targeted as labeled as one of the disinformation dozen
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:43.120]  And then you have a slew of other people that are very brave dr. Carrie midday
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:50.480]  Uh dr. Zev Zelenko a lot of these people who are just brilliant minds yourself included are coming forward
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:53.280]  But everybody has kind of a different opinion
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:57.760]  Regarding the way this approval letter is written some of you are saying
[3:36:58.320 --> 3:37:03.040]  No, unequivocally. It is not approved. Some of you are saying yes, absolutely. This is approved
[3:37:03.120 --> 3:37:06.800]  And then some of you are saying well part of it is approved and part of it is not on this
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:12.320]  What is your take is this thing fda approved or not? And if so, yes, what does it mean?
[3:37:13.920 --> 3:37:18.880]  Well stew, uh, it's a little bit of both and that's why the confusion ensues
[3:37:19.760 --> 3:37:24.560]  Across the board and why people are wondering why can so many different highly educated people
[3:37:25.200 --> 3:37:31.680]  That are normally in sync with each other sound like they're not and let me sort of tease this out a little bit for the audience
[3:37:31.680 --> 3:37:38.320]  You have to remember that feiser is in a business relationship with the german company buy on tech
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:40.400]  They share the marketing authorization
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:43.360]  In other words the the sales rights and things like that
[3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:50.880]  What we saw, uh, there definitely was a an approval. Let's put it that way of the drug called
[3:37:51.280 --> 3:37:53.520]  Comernautti and and actually that's not a new name
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:57.680]  That name has been sort of floating around if you really look in and out
[3:37:57.680 --> 3:38:01.840]  Uh in the weaving of the materials and the press releases over the last few months
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:07.760]  So there is an approval and I'll tell you how I know there's a document called the package insert
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:15.600]  You can download it from feiser's website. It is that document. I've explained many times on various shows including yours
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:21.920]  Like when you get the aspirin bottle from home from the drugstore you open the box and you toss out that little piece of paper
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:25.280]  That's wrapped around your aspirin. That's called the package insert
[3:38:25.280 --> 3:38:29.840]  That is a legal document that's been hammered out between the pharmaceutical company
[3:38:30.240 --> 3:38:32.240]  Whether it's a prescription drug or an over-the-counter
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:40.640]  And the fda every dot every number every letter in there is part of a contract and it is meant to disclose
[3:38:41.200 --> 3:38:43.200]  all the possible risks
[3:38:43.280 --> 3:38:44.560]  benefits
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:48.640]  Results from trials that led to the approval of whatever the entity is
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:53.040]  And and that's how we know we have an approval for Comernautti
[3:38:53.040 --> 3:38:59.600]  Now what the uh fda webs are sorry the feiser website goes on to say and I want to quote because this is very important
[3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:04.480]  In their news release you can look at their tabs. There's press investors news release
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:08.080]  It says here the fda approved
[3:39:08.720 --> 3:39:10.720]  Comernautti, okay
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:15.600]  And in the parentheses, they're very clever stew because they put both names
[3:39:15.680 --> 3:39:20.160]  They admit there are there are two formulations and here's what they say quote
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:27.520]  They have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide COVID-19 vaccination series
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:33.920]  But in the parentheses, they call it they mash it up together and actually in the title they mash it up together and they call it
[3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:36.320]  Uh the the Comernautti
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:39.200]  by a feiser-biontech
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:43.680]  Uh COVID-19 vaccination look we've got one formulation
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:51.120]  It's being divided into two titles or two two names the Comernautti was approved by the fda
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:56.000]  for 16 years of age and above the reason they extended the
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:58.640]  emergency use authorization
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:03.920]  Was because uh that was for 12 to 15 year olds because that age group of 12 to 15
[3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:07.920]  Did not get captured in the in the fda approval of Comernautti
[3:40:07.920 --> 3:40:13.840]  No, there have been questions to me. Dr. Jane, you know, they say Comernautti is not available yet. It's all the same formulation
[3:40:13.840 --> 3:40:18.320]  They just they tell you that directly. So this is really a I believe a red herring
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:22.720]  Uh and it leads to what I have deemed as an illegal
[3:40:23.280 --> 3:40:29.520]  Uh approval and as well as I believe the emergency use authorizations from day one including this one
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:36.480]  They just extended uh is illegal and that is the premise upon which I am working with america's frontline doctors
[3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:38.480]  attorneys group
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:44.480]  One particular group that is focused on getting an injunction against the dod as a start
[3:40:44.800 --> 3:40:52.240]  But the legal premises are based on the fact that when you look at the package insert and I I challenge anyone
[3:40:52.240 --> 3:40:55.040]  I encourage you get a package insert there
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:41:00.000]  You can get it from any company's website for any approved drug for your favorite diabetes drug
[3:41:00.240 --> 3:41:03.280]  Maybe for your favorite to your your blood pressure medication
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:07.760]  Download the package insert look at the categories and compare
[3:41:08.320 --> 3:41:11.760]  What is missing in the Pfizer Comernautti package insert?
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:16.800]  It's almost laughable stew and the absence of that information the absence of disclosure
[3:41:17.440 --> 3:41:24.640]  Uh to me and according to this legal group is a strong argument for rendering these approvals and eua's
[3:41:25.360 --> 3:41:28.960]  As illegal now where we're going to go where they're going to go
[3:41:28.960 --> 3:41:35.600]  Uh is is currently under strat a strategic discussion in terms of getting this heard and to get the injunction
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:39.600]  But I want to encourage everyone in the military right now to have some hope
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:46.080]  Buy some time do whatever you need to do legally to to to get the time and just wait because within uh
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:51.680]  Hopefully a few weeks. I I can't really give you a specific time. It depends on you know
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:55.680]  How the courts react, but I can tell you that we are working on this day
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:42:02.080]  Literally day and night and it is within days several days that this material will be filed
[3:42:02.160 --> 3:42:09.360]  And it looks to me like there's so much missing and there have been so many deviations from the FDA's own laws and regulations
[3:42:09.600 --> 3:42:12.000]  That this has to be deemed an illegal approval
[3:42:12.320 --> 3:42:16.160]  And I think the whole thing might get shut down at least on an injunction basis
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:23.520]  If the supreme court were with us and they had they looked into election fraud from 2020 which is now a blatant
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:26.240]  Seth keshel has proved it michael indell has done a great job
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:29.040]  I mean so many different people the numbers just don't lie wendy rogers
[3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:33.840]  The people in arizona coming up we we know that the thing was stolen by the 38 circles that were on the ground
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:37.520]  Versus 55 000 people at president try mean it doesn't take a rocket scientists
[3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:44.880]  We're all awake to that and then combined with what paul e alexander said about the misleading of the president by the corona task force
[3:42:45.200 --> 3:42:50.880]  Is something that I want to talk to you about as a doctor as a pharmaceutical researcher and somebody who has experience in this
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:54.080]  If you'll stick around with me, but this military thing needs to be touched on as well
[3:42:54.480 --> 3:42:57.600]  When we return on the alex jones show i'm stew peters joined by dr.

[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:04.000]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:04.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  So
[3:47:16.160 --> 3:47:17.280]  That guy
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:19.280]  Dr. Pauli Alexander
[3:47:19.280 --> 3:47:23.360]  The former senior advisor to the hhs under president trump
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:26.400]  joined me earlier pretty hard hitting interview
[3:47:27.280 --> 3:47:29.280]  And I flat out ask him look
[3:47:29.280 --> 3:47:33.600]  Did the coronavirus task force mislead president trump?
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:38.160]  Remember now that that task force was led by none other than
[3:47:38.720 --> 3:47:40.320]  mike pence
[3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:41.760]  the trader
[3:47:41.760 --> 3:47:44.800]  Okay, and yes, the answer is unequivocally
[3:47:45.680 --> 3:47:48.160]  The task force did mislead president trump now
[3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:53.440]  At first he agrees that a lockdown or a temporary shutdown
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:48:00.720]  The ban of travel things like that were required. Nobody really knew what exactly it was that we were dealing with
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:07.120]  And as I alluded to earlier when you were watching whatever your trusted so-called news outlet is
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:11.440]  You were watching as this thing started to bubble from china and then it went, you know
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:15.760]  Different areas and then it came here and I went whoa. Whoa amongst so did so many other
[3:48:16.320 --> 3:48:20.240]  Uh people who are awake to this. So this is going to be politicized. This is coming at the perfect time
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:25.360]  They're gonna shut everybody down. They're gonna promote promote mail-in ballots. We predicted this bio weapon would be
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:28.320]  Used in the theft of the election and it was
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:31.840]  But trump was begging these people to to open up
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:34.320]  The economy to open the country back up
[3:48:34.720 --> 3:48:40.480]  And what was doing it was people like dr. Paul alexander were going to the government to the white house and saying look
[3:48:41.280 --> 3:48:45.440]  We have an unprecedented amount of kids committing suicide
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:50.640]  We are losing so many people to death who are shutting down their businesses
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:54.800]  We can't sustain a country that has shut down like this
[3:48:54.880 --> 3:48:58.880]  And so the tension began between that task force and president trump and literally
[3:48:59.280 --> 3:49:04.880]  Dr. Paul alexander said when he was there at the pulpit in those briefings every day as no other president historically has done
[3:49:04.960 --> 3:49:08.800]  So many briefings as president trump and he was standing there trying to update the country
[3:49:09.040 --> 3:49:11.200]  These people were standing behind him as we know now
[3:49:11.200 --> 3:49:18.720]  Stabbing him right in the back and these people were weaponized and trump was dealing with not only battling his own
[3:49:19.280 --> 3:49:25.040]  HHS his own corona virus task force his own deep state right here in the united united states
[3:49:25.040 --> 3:49:31.360]  But was also battling, you know the cdc and the fda as well as china and all of tony fauci's influence
[3:49:32.240 --> 3:49:34.240]  financial backers bill gates
[3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:39.920]  George soros all of these uh, you know the the the world economic forum claus Schwab. I mean dealing. He was up against
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:41.920]  a cabal that is
[3:49:42.160 --> 3:49:44.160]  unfathomable unimaginable
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:47.040]  And so we started talking about then
[3:49:47.840 --> 3:49:51.840]  The the the rhetoric about the of the pandemic itself does this thing exist
[3:49:52.640 --> 3:49:56.080]  And he said no no it doesn't and let me tell you why and he told us why I mean
[3:49:56.800 --> 3:49:59.600]  Really an amazing interview. It's not too long. It's like 15 minutes
[3:50:00.160 --> 3:50:02.880]  Check it out and I hope to bring him here to info wars because
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:05.040]  this guy
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:10.640]  These are the people that need to join the parade of brave doctors like the ten pennies
[3:50:11.280 --> 3:50:14.320]  Like the dr. Simone golds like to carry middays
[3:50:14.720 --> 3:50:20.560]  And of course joining us now is dr. Jane ruby another one that has just done a fantastic job
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:23.920]  I can't tell you how much I appreciate how responsible you are
[3:50:24.720 --> 3:50:26.960]  With your finding and your reporting
[3:50:27.840 --> 3:50:29.360]  And it's unpopular
[3:50:29.360 --> 3:50:32.000]  Uh, especially to people like lead stories and usa today
[3:50:32.000 --> 3:50:38.880]  You're fact-checked all the time. You were the first to break the findings of the spanish researchers laquita colomna on the graphene oxide deal
[3:50:39.920 --> 3:50:41.920]  It's now pretty much widely known
[3:50:41.920 --> 3:50:46.320]  Karen kinkston said in looking at the patent am I convinced that graphene oxide is in this
[3:50:46.720 --> 3:50:51.120]  I'm I'm equally as convinced of that as I'm convinced that gravity exists on earth
[3:50:52.320 --> 3:50:54.320]  So I want to talk to you about this
[3:50:54.320 --> 3:51:01.040]  I asked dr. Alexander about the vaccine specifically the rhetoric of the president and he had his own
[3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:08.960]  You know kind of a hypothesis on that his basic thesis was the president president trump specifically needs to come forward now
[3:51:09.440 --> 3:51:10.720]  and say
[3:51:10.720 --> 3:51:12.720]  These vaccines are not needed
[3:51:13.040 --> 3:51:16.560]  Please do not give them to kids and that that would be all that he would need to say
[3:51:16.560 --> 3:51:19.600]  He wouldn't really need to say much anything else other than that
[3:51:19.600 --> 3:51:25.760]  But in your findings and in the studies because I know that you have your finger on the pulse of the global community
[3:51:26.480 --> 3:51:28.480]  and israel is quite
[3:51:28.480 --> 3:51:32.640]  The testing ground for what we're going to see here is that population is
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:36.320]  almost fully inoculated, but yet they seem to be
[3:51:37.520 --> 3:51:40.240]  Seeing some of the most coveted infected
[3:51:40.880 --> 3:51:46.800]  Patients and that the why the vast majority of the people that are hospitalized there with covet or so-called breakout cases
[3:51:46.800 --> 3:51:49.840]  Are actually considered to be quote fully vaccinated
[3:51:50.320 --> 3:51:54.320]  Is this antibody dependent enhancement and what are we going to see here?
[3:51:55.200 --> 3:51:58.080]  As the fall comes are we going to have a really dark winter?
[3:51:59.920 --> 3:52:01.920]  Well, only if we allow the
[3:52:02.960 --> 3:52:04.960]  Propagandists and the biden regime
[3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:11.280]  To to talk people into it to use fear once again like they did last year look in the very beginning
[3:52:11.520 --> 3:52:13.520]  None of us really knew what this was
[3:52:13.520 --> 3:52:17.200]  Even those of us who are medically trained so we had to be cautious
[3:52:17.200 --> 3:52:20.320]  We had and I'm sure president trumped it as well, and I'm going to tell you stew
[3:52:20.320 --> 3:52:25.760]  I worked in the office of presidential correspondence in the white house from 2017
[3:52:26.720 --> 3:52:32.720]  Through 2018 and I can tell you directly from my own experience that there are saboteurs
[3:52:33.200 --> 3:52:37.360]  There were people keeping things from the president. There were people who told me
[3:52:37.360 --> 3:52:45.200]  The stories I couldn't believe in fact I published two articles back in 2017 to tell people that people who were applying through
[3:52:45.920 --> 3:52:47.920]  You know president trump's website were being
[3:52:48.480 --> 3:52:53.440]  Throttled and the people who did get into the agency started calling me after that first article to say
[3:52:53.680 --> 3:52:59.520]  Hey, our our bosses our managers are obama holdovers and they're firing the trump appointees left and right
[3:52:59.920 --> 3:53:04.800]  So there was so much going on and also president trump got you know pulled in by you know
[3:53:04.800 --> 3:53:08.160]  Ryan's previous and the rhino cabal to trust them
[3:53:08.640 --> 3:53:13.280]  Initially to set up parts of the government. So I I watched first hand
[3:53:13.840 --> 3:53:17.520]  I would love to see president trump come out because we're at the precipice now
[3:53:17.760 --> 3:53:21.840]  And we need him to come out and really get the real story and acknowledge it
[3:53:22.080 --> 3:53:30.480]  But I can clearly understand how he you know stop start stop start and and and appears to be going along with it without really being a
[3:53:30.480 --> 3:53:34.800]  part of it because the power of the sabotage was absolutely
[3:53:35.600 --> 3:53:40.320]  Unun just immeasurable. It was overwhelming and I was just watching it from the sidelines
[3:53:40.880 --> 3:53:42.880]  Well, and that continues right now
[3:53:42.960 --> 3:53:49.040]  As what is the crumbling remains of that trump administration are still hanging on I call them dingleberries
[3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:54.400]  Uh people like jared kushner and then you have the conservative ink people just holding on to that
[3:53:54.480 --> 3:53:59.440]  The only thing that they really want to conserve is their access to that trump fundraising machine
[3:53:59.440 --> 3:54:01.440]  But as long as these pseudo
[3:54:02.080 --> 3:54:03.280]  liberal
[3:54:03.280 --> 3:54:05.280]  People are around him
[3:54:05.280 --> 3:54:10.880]  Uh, you know, that's exactly what's going to happen is that he's going to be these gatekeepers are going to protect him from the information
[3:54:10.960 --> 3:54:11.840]  but
[3:54:11.840 --> 3:54:13.040]  that aside
[3:54:13.040 --> 3:54:18.800]  And I I I don't believe that president trump is part of any cabal or that president trump wishes ill on anybody
[3:54:18.880 --> 3:54:22.560]  I don't I believe that president trump loves our flag loves god loves america
[3:54:22.880 --> 3:54:27.920]  And he would not do anything that would intentionally kill maim in the incapacitate harm handicap anybody
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:34.240]  Specifically kids. I believe baron is vaccine injured. I mean don't I don't know that for for a fact
[3:54:34.240 --> 3:54:39.280]  But I have heard those things so but I I'm sure that he's very aware of big pharma
[3:54:39.600 --> 3:54:46.160]  The dangers associated with big pharma and when somebody recently just within the last two weeks was with president trump inside of mar-a-lago
[3:54:46.160 --> 3:54:48.640]  The report that I got was are you going to take down?
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:50.960]  Or why didn't you take down big pharma?
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:56.400]  Or what's it going to take to bring them down and he winked and said that's a second term task and so
[3:54:56.400 --> 3:54:59.520]  So with that being said the trump part of it
[3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:05.360]  I'm kind of putting aside and coming to my own conclusions about what he did and the the tyrannical
[3:55:05.760 --> 3:55:10.880]  You know overtaking that he was confronted with but in about a minute and a half here
[3:55:11.840 --> 3:55:14.080]  What do you expect this upcoming fall?
[3:55:14.640 --> 3:55:22.000]  And and in the winter specifically because we're seeing respiratory, you know transmission rsv and kids all kinds of
[3:55:22.560 --> 3:55:24.560]  really
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:31.200]  Interesting breakouts happening that normally don't happen in the middle of the summer are these is this a result of these jabbed inoculated people?
[3:55:32.560 --> 3:55:38.480]  I think we're going to see a combination of things too and you've really hit on a lot of it the antibody dependent enhancement
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:40.480]  which is kind of an over priming of the
[3:55:40.960 --> 3:55:44.400]  The immunity from people who have taken the injections
[3:55:44.800 --> 3:55:48.400]  You're going to see an overreaction from those people when they're exposed again
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:52.560]  This is what we believe based on what happened in the animal studies for SARS-CoV-1
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:56.800]  When the animals were re-challenged in the natural environment they they reacted even
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:00.880]  You know in a more intense way more robust way and they got sicker
[3:56:01.600 --> 3:56:06.720]  What I also think is going to happen is that you know a lot of viruses are under the coronavirus umbrella
[3:56:07.040 --> 3:56:10.160]  So many of the people who had the natural disease will
[3:56:11.040 --> 3:56:13.760]  Demonstrate and be protected by that natural
[3:56:14.560 --> 3:56:21.200]  Immunity, why do I say that because the variants or the additions or they're all sort of familial
[3:56:21.200 --> 3:56:26.480]  And your body your body's surveillance system will recognize them as such with that said stew
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:28.480]  I want to give you one other one caveat
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:35.760]  My caveat is we don't know what we don't know and we don't know if they are releasing
[3:56:36.240 --> 3:56:41.520]  A modified version of what was out last year either it was out last year
[3:56:41.760 --> 3:56:46.240]  And they co-opted something naturally or they gained a functioned it by ginning it up
[3:56:46.240 --> 3:56:53.200]  Or if they released something that they they gained a functioned in Wuhan China, but whatever it is
[3:56:53.840 --> 3:56:56.480]  Don't know what we don't know, but I want a prediction on you because
[3:56:56.960 --> 3:57:03.200]  30 seconds left here is the hospital are the hospitals going to be overwhelmed with people dying because of this injection
[3:57:04.480 --> 3:57:09.200]  I do believe there'll be a large number of people that what but stew it's going to be very tricky
[3:57:09.520 --> 3:57:14.720]  Because it's not going to readily look like it's connected to the injections and that's my concern
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:20.080]  We have to be very vigilant, you know, these injuries are across a number of different body systems
[3:57:20.400 --> 3:57:22.880]  And most people are going to say oh, it has nothing to do with the shot
[3:57:23.600 --> 3:57:27.520]  Yeah, and we saw that coming because this thing attacks so many different organs
[3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:33.360]  You know, you have the myocarditis. You have the kidney stuff. You have stroke blood pressure all kinds of different things
[3:57:33.360 --> 3:57:37.120]  Dr. Gene ruby, thank you so much for joining us today. You're a wealth of information. We really appreciate it
[3:57:37.120 --> 3:57:39.120]  Oh, and shroyer is up next on the war room
