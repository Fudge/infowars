[00:00.000 --> 00:11.400]  There's an article at infowars.com that tells it all.
[00:11.400 --> 00:18.040]  Palates of bricks delivered in front of the Dallas City Hall and police station.
[00:18.040 --> 00:21.800]  Fire bombs delivered in Minnesota.
[00:21.800 --> 00:29.480]  The left, Soros, the globalists, the chai comms trying to fund martial law in America.
[00:29.480 --> 00:34.680]  So that when buildings are being burnt down, people are being killed, security guards at
[00:34.680 --> 00:39.600]  federal buildings are being shot dead, the media gives it almost no coverage.
[00:39.600 --> 00:46.120]  So that when local and federal government responds, they can tell the public this is
[00:46.120 --> 00:48.760]  tyranny, attack them.
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.920]  This is an attempt to trigger a civil war.
[00:50.920 --> 00:56.840]  The globalists can't defeat America, but they can trick us to fight each other over
[00:56.840 --> 00:59.280]  made up or exaggerated issues they went.
[00:59.280 --> 01:05.160]  So here's footage in Minneapolis, St. Paul of the National Guard called out to clear
[01:05.160 --> 01:10.800]  the streets, they've been given orders to make people go in their houses, firing rubber
[01:10.800 --> 01:12.800]  bullets at people.
[01:12.800 --> 01:15.680]  And this is being boosted to the top of Twitter.
[01:15.680 --> 01:18.760]  And I don't like it, it looks like a police state, but they've been ordered there and
[01:18.760 --> 01:22.320]  lawlessness created this.
[01:22.320 --> 01:26.200]  And so all the trendies that want civil war and want all this, they're getting what they
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.200]  ask for.
[01:27.200 --> 01:34.500]  But here's the footage being boosted nationwide right now.
[01:34.500 --> 01:37.500]  Look at this. They just keep coming.
[01:37.500 --> 01:41.500]  Oh! Go inside! Get inside! Get inside!
[01:44.500 --> 01:47.500]  Get inside! Get in your house now! Let's go!
[01:49.500 --> 01:50.500]  Light them up!
[01:51.500 --> 01:53.500]  Go inside now! Get in the house!
[01:58.500 --> 02:00.500]  Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in!
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.500]  Get in! Get in! Get in!
[02:04.500 --> 02:05.500]  Light them up!
[02:07.500 --> 02:09.500]  Go inside your house!
[02:09.500 --> 02:10.500]  Light the house!
[02:12.500 --> 02:16.500]  Now, notice the Imperial Stormtroopers are precise.
[02:16.500 --> 02:21.500]  They actually shoot the woman in the chest from 60 yards away.
[02:21.500 --> 02:23.500]  Because that's what they're trained to do.
[02:23.500 --> 02:26.500]  This is what Soros and the Globalist are conjuring,
[02:26.500 --> 02:29.500]  is the actual military, the actual police,
[02:29.500 --> 02:31.500]  and they use a bunch of meth-head idiots out there
[02:31.500 --> 02:33.500]  to poke the bear to do it.
[02:33.500 --> 02:35.500]  And then these people are ordered to go out and clear the streets.
[02:35.500 --> 02:37.500]  What's going to happen? A disaster!
[02:39.500 --> 02:41.500]  And then the government itself is blamed
[02:41.500 --> 02:44.500]  when a foreign, globalist government is taking our government over.
[02:44.500 --> 02:47.500]  Our government's got problems, but man, you think it's bad?
[02:47.500 --> 02:51.500]  Let's go to this compilation of just some of what happened in Austin
[02:51.500 --> 02:54.500]  in the last 24 hours. We're into day two of the riots
[02:54.500 --> 02:57.500]  with the Austin mayor ordering the police to stand down.
[02:57.500 --> 02:59.500]  Here it is.
[03:01.500 --> 03:04.500]  And again, I'll voice this for radio listeners.
[03:04.500 --> 03:10.500]  Throne footage we shot of the useful idiots, about 90% are white,
[03:10.500 --> 03:13.500]  on average about 50-year-old potbellied men and women,
[03:13.500 --> 03:16.500]  and they are there believing it's a communist revolution
[03:16.500 --> 03:18.500]  trying to invoke blacks to go out and riot.
[03:18.500 --> 03:21.500]  It did not happen the way they wanted it to.
[03:21.500 --> 03:26.500]  And I was there today.
[03:29.500 --> 03:32.500]  Some idiots did follow what Soros wanted.
[03:36.500 --> 03:39.500]  This is all footage shot by our crew.
[03:39.500 --> 03:41.500]  We got hit with rubber bullets.
[03:41.500 --> 03:43.500]  Savannah got hit.
[03:43.500 --> 03:45.500]  Drew got hit.
[03:45.500 --> 03:47.500]  White people were attacked on site.
[03:47.500 --> 03:50.500]  The left celebrated it.
[03:50.500 --> 03:52.500]  And none of these whites being racially attacked
[03:52.500 --> 03:55.500]  are going to be lionized or built up as victims.
[03:55.500 --> 03:57.500]  It's all original footage.
[03:57.500 --> 03:59.500]  You won't see anywhere else.
[03:59.500 --> 04:01.500]  But they want it full or shut down.
[04:01.500 --> 04:03.500]  None of this is boosted like the National Guard.
[04:03.500 --> 04:05.500]  Then you show your National Guard shooting rubber bullets at you
[04:05.500 --> 04:08.500]  and go, well, what's the point? Why are they doing this?
[04:08.500 --> 04:12.500]  They're going to areas where there are looters
[04:12.500 --> 04:14.500]  and clear the streets.
[04:14.500 --> 04:18.500]  And again, the average cop is just an average person.
[04:18.500 --> 04:20.500]  I don't lionize them. I don't worship them.
[04:20.500 --> 04:23.500]  They're following awful orders, my question.
[04:23.500 --> 04:27.500]  And so to make the average cop or National Guard soldier
[04:27.500 --> 04:30.500]  is very diverse, by the way, racially,
[04:30.500 --> 04:33.500]  to make it all them like they triggered this,
[04:33.500 --> 04:36.500]  like they did this, it's just not reality-based.
[04:36.500 --> 04:38.500]  It's like I'm mad at the border being open
[04:38.500 --> 04:40.500]  and Islamics being brought in,
[04:40.500 --> 04:44.500]  and then they want to search me at a TSA checkpoint.
[04:44.500 --> 04:46.500]  I don't blame the TSA agent.
[04:46.500 --> 04:48.500]  It's Congress allowed that.
[04:48.500 --> 04:51.500]  That's how you get stuff done is who's in charge.
[04:51.500 --> 04:54.500]  So this is the next globalist move we predicted.
[04:54.500 --> 04:56.500]  It's probably about the armored vehicle.
[04:56.500 --> 04:58.500]  We had to have that armored vehicle
[04:58.500 --> 05:10.500]  to be able to sort something out.
[05:10.500 --> 05:13.500]  And we certainly are able to do that.
[05:13.500 --> 05:17.500]  We don't know what that means in the press freedom today.
[05:17.500 --> 05:19.500]  Memorial Day is here.
[05:19.500 --> 05:22.500]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[05:22.500 --> 05:24.500]  Now, we were already running a huge sale,
[05:24.500 --> 05:26.500]  but we're having to end that one
[05:26.500 --> 05:28.160]  Admin on sale for almost six months.
[05:28.160 --> 05:30.000]  It is 50% off.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.440]  Bio-dry selenium, 60% off.
[05:32.440 --> 05:34.060]  ShaleForge, it's incredible.
[05:34.060 --> 05:35.880]  60% off.
[05:35.880 --> 05:38.400]  And you've got all these other items on sale as well
[05:38.400 --> 05:39.440]  until they sell out.
[05:39.440 --> 05:41.960]  So infowarstore.com, or triple eight,
[05:41.960 --> 05:44.080]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine,
[05:44.080 --> 05:45.940]  to get these items to take advantage
[05:45.940 --> 05:48.080]  of this mega sale Memorial Day.
[05:48.080 --> 05:49.720]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[05:49.720 --> 05:52.520]  We appreciate your support, your financial support,
[05:52.520 --> 05:53.980]  but it's also supported you and your family
[05:53.980 --> 05:55.680]  with amazing products that are so good
[05:55.680 --> 05:56.560]  for you and your body.
[05:56.560 --> 05:58.060]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[05:58.060 --> 05:59.560]  We are all in this together.
[05:59.560 --> 06:23.880]  History is happening.
[06:23.880 --> 06:27.120]  America is fighting for its life.
[06:27.120 --> 06:29.400]  We're 155 days out from this historic election.
[06:29.400 --> 06:33.820]  It is May 31st, 2020 on this Sunday transmission.
[06:33.820 --> 06:37.080]  And I'll tell you, America is fighting for its place
[06:37.080 --> 06:39.520]  as First Nation in the world.
[06:39.520 --> 06:40.800]  Who cares about the economy?
[06:40.800 --> 06:43.160]  It's about basic human freedoms.
[06:43.160 --> 06:46.800]  And as we lose that first place to the Chai Kong Dragon,
[06:46.800 --> 06:50.200]  the authoritarianism of China, the surveillance grid,
[06:50.200 --> 06:53.060]  the social credit score, all the evils,
[06:53.060 --> 06:55.760]  the three million Muslims in forced labor death camps
[06:55.760 --> 07:00.760]  working for Apple and Nike, they become the precedent.
[07:01.240 --> 07:02.680]  They become the leader.
[07:02.680 --> 07:06.840]  They become the spirit of the world, not 1776.
[07:06.840 --> 07:08.120]  Thank you so much for joining us
[07:08.120 --> 07:09.820]  on this live Sunday transmission.
[07:11.320 --> 07:14.760]  In over 50 cities, people have died,
[07:14.760 --> 07:17.920]  police have been killed, security guards have been murdered,
[07:17.920 --> 07:19.480]  citizens have been beaten to death.
[07:19.480 --> 07:22.720]  It's barely footnoted in the news.
[07:22.720 --> 07:26.600]  Riders throwing mall off cocktails at point blank range.
[07:26.600 --> 07:31.600]  You got a bottle of gasoline in a big beer bottle
[07:33.120 --> 07:35.640]  and you throw it right at a door at two feet away
[07:35.640 --> 07:37.480]  and it catches you on fire.
[07:37.480 --> 07:41.140]  I mean, it has just been an exercise in insanity.
[07:42.080 --> 07:45.200]  But after the fake Russia gate and the fake Ukraine gate
[07:45.200 --> 07:47.880]  and the fake impeachment and now COVID-19,
[07:47.880 --> 07:52.800]  that giant hoax in that it's any worse than the flu.
[07:52.800 --> 07:55.680]  After all of that, we said, what's next, race war?
[07:55.680 --> 08:00.040]  So they can always cherry pick out of 350 million Americans.
[08:00.040 --> 08:01.480]  There's always some police officer
[08:01.480 --> 08:04.000]  doing something wrong or questionable.
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.640]  And that's all in the store we'll get to next hour.
[08:07.520 --> 08:11.600]  This man that dies in porn, he's at a dance club.
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.860]  He's involved, he knows both the officers that are there
[08:13.860 --> 08:15.800]  when he dies that worked with him.
[08:15.800 --> 08:18.880]  I mean, this thing is stinky.
[08:18.880 --> 08:22.480]  Just like the Smollett case, just like so many others.
[08:22.480 --> 08:24.920]  I'm not saying he didn't die.
[08:24.920 --> 08:27.080]  I'm saying it looks like some type of organized crime
[08:27.080 --> 08:30.080]  battle going on from what we see at the preliminary level.
[08:35.200 --> 08:36.560]  So it's all coming up.
[08:36.560 --> 08:39.960]  It turns out he is a major porn star
[08:41.520 --> 08:42.600]  and worked with both the officers
[08:42.600 --> 08:45.000]  that were there that killed him basically.
[08:45.000 --> 08:46.360]  So something weird's going on.
[08:46.360 --> 08:47.360]  That's all I'm saying.
[08:47.360 --> 08:48.520]  That's all coming up today.
[08:48.520 --> 08:50.160]  But here's what's happened
[08:50.160 --> 08:52.880]  where I met in Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[08:56.480 --> 08:58.920]  We send Owen Schreuer out in the armored vehicle
[08:58.920 --> 09:00.360]  that we bought over a year ago
[09:00.360 --> 09:02.640]  because we knew that there'd be martial law
[09:02.640 --> 09:04.280]  and race riots and craziness
[09:04.280 --> 09:06.320]  because already trying to go out to a Trump event,
[09:06.320 --> 09:08.760]  we get bottles thrown at us and rocks thrown us.
[09:10.600 --> 09:12.360]  And they're literally on video in Austin
[09:12.360 --> 09:16.480]  attacking us with hammers and clubs and metal rods
[09:16.480 --> 09:18.480]  and everything on just a city street.
[09:18.480 --> 09:21.080]  It's almost all white people, by the way, leading it.
[09:23.200 --> 09:24.400]  The virtue signals.
[09:27.440 --> 09:32.440]  And when they do all this, the media doesn't cover it
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.680]  or the media sits there and promotes it
[09:39.680 --> 09:41.040]  like it's a good thing.
[09:41.040 --> 09:43.720]  Oh, look, the major Democrat side said
[09:43.720 --> 09:46.680]  the fastest Alex Jones was attacked, he deserves it.
[09:47.880 --> 09:49.520]  And all Owen did was write up and say,
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.640]  hey, we're Americans, we're against police brutality.
[09:52.640 --> 09:55.440]  The guy that did this has been charged, arrested,
[09:55.440 --> 09:59.080]  let's come together, and a bunch of weird white methods,
[10:00.080 --> 10:01.720]  because that's who they are.
[10:01.720 --> 10:04.240]  All came up and attacked who were out there busily
[10:04.240 --> 10:08.000]  trying to provoke black people into a civil war,
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.160]  which Soros' own documents that fell into our hands
[10:11.160 --> 10:14.640]  two years ago show how they have hired white academics
[10:15.800 --> 10:18.520]  post-up government and academic workers
[10:18.520 --> 10:21.040]  trying to go out and start all this.
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.280]  But let's go ahead and go to a few of these clips.
[10:27.560 --> 10:29.560]  Let's just go to this first one, here it is.
[10:31.600 --> 10:36.600]  This is the armored vehicle, five blocks from the protests
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.260]  being attacked by white virtue settlers,
[10:41.600 --> 10:44.480]  beta males that are supposedly super powerful warriors
[10:44.480 --> 10:46.480]  when they're not storming methamphetamine
[10:47.360 --> 10:49.080]  or not dressing as women.
[10:49.080 --> 10:51.280]  And you've got a obese black lady there,
[10:51.280 --> 10:53.480]  she's trying to stop folks attacking, actually.
[10:55.920 --> 10:58.360]  And you've got, again,
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.560]  dudes that have all left their mother's basement,
[11:02.040 --> 11:03.600]  attacking the vehicle
[11:03.600 --> 11:06.760]  and trying to climb in the back
[11:06.760 --> 11:08.080]  and trying to knock the speakers off
[11:08.080 --> 11:10.000]  because they kept shouting, you're censored,
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.840]  you're not on the internet, you don't count.
[11:11.840 --> 11:12.920]  Shut up, shut up.
[11:12.920 --> 11:15.000]  They kept saying like, you're banned, you're banned.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.480]  Ha ha ha, we banned you.
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.840]  They revel in anti-free speech
[11:20.840 --> 11:22.040]  and they attack the police,
[11:22.040 --> 11:25.000]  but anti-police slogans over the American flag.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.360]  They spray paint at all
[11:26.360 --> 11:29.880]  and they've got some super powerful, tough white dude
[11:29.880 --> 11:31.160]  hammering the window
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.520]  and then the left announced, oh, we destroyed their tank.
[11:36.480 --> 11:38.880]  No, we had the vehicle to go down
[11:38.880 --> 11:40.200]  and expose how you're violent.
[11:40.200 --> 11:41.280]  We knew it was coming.
[11:41.280 --> 11:42.440]  We were proven right.
[11:44.520 --> 11:47.760]  Now, the next clip is very, very important.
[11:49.680 --> 11:51.640]  Let's just go to that clip, here it is.
[11:55.480 --> 11:58.800]  Antifa leftist sites on YouTube
[11:58.800 --> 12:02.480]  are celebrating the attack on this vehicle
[12:02.480 --> 12:06.640]  and saying ha ha ha in all the rest of the day.
[12:06.640 --> 12:10.000]  But that's why we got this armored vehicle
[12:10.000 --> 12:14.080]  is because these terrorists won't let us go
[12:14.080 --> 12:16.000]  and cover events without being attacked.
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.120]  That's the whole point.
[12:17.120 --> 12:19.640]  Listen, I'm a big gun enthusiast, everybody knows that,
[12:19.640 --> 12:20.480]  but I don't normally,
[12:20.480 --> 12:22.400]  in fact, I don't ever carry firearms
[12:22.400 --> 12:25.000]  to demonstrations or out in the media.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.120]  I didn't even have security or an armored vehicle,
[12:27.120 --> 12:29.840]  but now I'm actually carrying a nine millimeter
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.680]  because these people will probably try
[12:31.680 --> 12:33.400]  to mow off cocktails for attackers.
[12:33.400 --> 12:35.400]  They'll try to kill us so they were able to get in here.
[12:35.400 --> 12:36.520]  So that's what we have to do in America
[12:36.520 --> 12:39.000]  is now arm ourselves to go on the streets of America
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.160]  because you can't come on the police
[12:40.160 --> 12:41.960]  because they're surrounded and not gunned.
[12:41.960 --> 12:43.280]  So just think about where America is
[12:43.280 --> 12:44.720]  and think about where the world's gone.
[12:44.720 --> 12:47.360]  That literally for the first time in 26 years on air,
[12:47.360 --> 12:48.800]  I'm gonna carry a firearm now,
[12:48.800 --> 12:51.760]  gotta have security and an armored vehicle.
[12:51.760 --> 12:53.680]  Oh, that's more of white yuppies.
[12:53.680 --> 12:56.120]  Look, it's more leftist out telling the black people
[12:56.120 --> 12:57.440]  of riot.
[12:57.440 --> 13:02.440]  Yeah, 1776, we know George Soros
[13:05.240 --> 13:10.240]  is funding the COVID-19 lockdown and the martial law.
[13:10.240 --> 13:12.200]  We know it's all these white trendies
[13:12.200 --> 13:14.640]  trying to get the black folks to riot.
[13:14.640 --> 13:17.360]  To see these comebacks all failing,
[13:17.360 --> 13:19.760]  the last one is shut down America,
[13:19.760 --> 13:22.240]  just like they're blocking traffic right now
[13:22.240 --> 13:24.080]  to try to shut up my three speech.
[13:24.080 --> 13:24.920]  Look at this right here,
[13:24.920 --> 13:27.960]  the National Guard having to protect the governor's mansion
[13:27.960 --> 13:30.040]  from liberal communist Chinese
[13:30.040 --> 13:32.120]  finance globalist on record.
[13:32.120 --> 13:34.400]  The communist Chinese have all their speech
[13:34.400 --> 13:37.000]  to call for race war and killing police.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.720]  But America doesn't have any speech.
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.040]  We know the left really wanna kill
[13:42.040 --> 13:44.720]  as many black babies as they could
[13:44.720 --> 13:48.800]  ever since the Democrats founded the KKK.
[13:48.800 --> 13:51.000]  Oh, you're so, oh, how to look over your little commies
[13:51.000 --> 13:52.160]  down in Central America.
[13:52.160 --> 13:54.240]  Oh, you're such a big man.
[13:54.240 --> 13:56.680]  Hey, how the chai comms doing, dirtbags?
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.280]  infowars.com, infowars.com, America Still Lives.
[14:01.280 --> 14:03.280]  Xi Jinping thanks you for helping him put
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.640]  three million Muslims in concentration camps in China.
[14:07.640 --> 14:10.440]  The Democratic Party that founded the KKK,
[14:10.440 --> 14:12.800]  the Democratic Party that founded the KKK,
[14:12.800 --> 14:15.440]  thanks you, Democrats, for aborting your babies.
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.280]  Whatever you do, word of mouth free.
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.320]  So use your word of mouth right now
[14:18.320 --> 14:20.080]  to trump the globalist for counting on you
[14:20.080 --> 14:22.200]  not taking action, but I know you're gonna take action.
[14:22.200 --> 14:24.280]  You're a modern polar bearer, so thank you.
[14:24.280 --> 14:26.560]  All right, there's hours of the Savannah video,
[14:26.560 --> 14:29.280]  but let me get to Savannah Hernandez now.
[14:29.280 --> 14:32.080]  So Savannah, who I told, go with security, said no.
[14:32.080 --> 14:35.360]  She's down there, and it's mainly white protesters.
[14:35.360 --> 14:36.560]  We're actually some black racists
[14:36.560 --> 14:38.000]  who are beating up white people
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.720]  that are blocking a major highway.
[14:39.720 --> 14:41.120]  A guy's a liberal comes out and says,
[14:41.120 --> 14:44.920]  hey, please, I support you, but don't do this to me.
[14:44.920 --> 14:46.680]  These big guys are beating him up.
[14:46.680 --> 14:49.000]  Savannah goes and stands up to him and stops him.
[14:49.000 --> 14:49.960]  Here's that footage.
[14:49.960 --> 14:54.960]  I walk down, I would walk in the sixth street,
[14:54.960 --> 14:57.440]  and he's like, oh, that's a shit, is that a gun?
[14:57.440 --> 14:59.280]  Everybody's getting hit.
[14:59.280 --> 15:02.360]  And these guys got major waybos, man.
[15:02.360 --> 15:03.960]  Just blocking traffic for hours,
[15:03.960 --> 15:06.360]  you get out and you say, hey, please, don't block me,
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.800]  and you get hit in the head.
[15:11.480 --> 15:13.040]  It's all these transplants from New York
[15:13.040 --> 15:14.240]  where there was no guns.
[15:16.160 --> 15:17.360]  The poor guy's been knocked,
[15:17.360 --> 15:19.880]  he's trying to find his glasses down the ground.
[15:19.880 --> 15:20.720]  But he's not allowed to,
[15:20.720 --> 15:22.440]  because he's white, he's a bad person.
[15:23.960 --> 15:25.360]  Boom, and they had a gun.
[15:33.880 --> 15:34.880]  Here comes Savannah.
[15:44.880 --> 15:48.680]  Savannah used to be a very restrained girl,
[15:48.680 --> 15:50.640]  but in the wars, that didn't happen.
[15:50.640 --> 15:52.520]  If I think about war,
[15:52.520 --> 15:54.680]  makes people wake up and take action.
[15:54.680 --> 15:55.600]  Well, they're out backstage,
[15:55.600 --> 15:57.400]  whether it's for so jam-packed today,
[15:57.400 --> 15:59.960]  you don't want to miss a single second.
[15:59.960 --> 16:01.840]  I've hunted a lot of big game
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.360]  at long distances with high caliber rifles,
[16:04.360 --> 16:08.600]  and when you shoot an elk at, say, 600 yards,
[16:08.600 --> 16:10.000]  even if you hit them right in the heart,
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.720]  they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[16:14.720 --> 16:17.280]  They've got that adrenaline pumping
[16:17.280 --> 16:19.320]  through their arteries and through their veins,
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.320]  but all of a sudden they slow down,
[16:21.320 --> 16:22.920]  they realize what's happened,
[16:22.920 --> 16:25.280]  they fall over and they die.
[16:25.280 --> 16:28.320]  Then you go back and haul them back in.
[16:28.320 --> 16:31.880]  Well, that's what's gonna happen to the entire world now.
[16:31.880 --> 16:34.520]  And that's what the economic numbers show,
[16:34.520 --> 16:37.680]  is that we've been shot right in the heart,
[16:37.680 --> 16:38.680]  and for the first world,
[16:38.680 --> 16:41.080]  it's gonna mean a long, horrible depression
[16:41.080 --> 16:42.800]  and a lot of death.
[16:42.800 --> 16:43.680]  Well, for the third world,
[16:43.680 --> 16:45.440]  it's gonna mean probably over 100 million dead
[16:45.440 --> 16:47.640]  according to the UN and I believe their numbers,
[16:47.640 --> 16:50.640]  because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this
[16:50.640 --> 16:52.360]  to depopulate the third world.
[16:52.360 --> 16:53.600]  So that all the leftists had thought
[16:53.600 --> 16:55.480]  it was their revolution to get rid of Trump.
[16:55.480 --> 16:56.480]  You're a bunch of suckers
[16:56.480 --> 16:57.560]  and you bought into something
[16:57.560 --> 16:59.600]  better than what Hitler did.
[16:59.600 --> 17:01.320]  I don't have to tell you
[17:01.320 --> 17:04.240]  that we are in the most important point in human history.
[17:04.240 --> 17:05.920]  The globalists have taken the gloves off
[17:05.920 --> 17:07.400]  and they've taken the mask off,
[17:07.400 --> 17:10.360]  and they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[17:10.360 --> 17:12.160]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.920]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[17:13.920 --> 17:15.800]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[17:15.800 --> 17:17.840]  You are non-essential.
[17:17.840 --> 17:19.640]  We are shutting your ass down.
[17:19.640 --> 17:22.040]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers
[17:22.040 --> 17:24.560]  and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[17:24.560 --> 17:26.160]  You're gonna be the service economy.
[17:26.160 --> 17:28.360]  And now the globalists are telling you
[17:28.360 --> 17:30.360]  that there's no more service economy
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.560]  and you're obsolete,
[17:31.560 --> 17:32.920]  so you better bow down to them
[17:32.920 --> 17:35.480]  and get your universal pittance income
[17:35.480 --> 17:37.280]  so they can dictate your life.
[17:37.280 --> 17:39.880]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[17:39.880 --> 17:42.560]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order,
[17:42.560 --> 17:45.280]  and that takes you understanding you were right
[17:45.280 --> 17:46.720]  and understanding I was right
[17:46.720 --> 17:48.120]  and getting in people's faces
[17:48.120 --> 17:51.400]  and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[17:51.400 --> 17:53.200]  Now is the time for action.
[17:53.200 --> 17:55.080]  Now is the time for you to shine
[17:55.080 --> 17:57.400]  and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[18:00.320 --> 18:02.760]  I'm always excited about M4's Life Products.
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.000]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  You love them, I love them,
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.360]  and they fund the M4 War
[18:06.360 --> 18:08.640]  in the face of the globalist arms line.
[18:08.640 --> 18:11.240]  But we have come up with a new product.
[18:11.240 --> 18:15.400]  Over a year in development, that is amazing.
[18:15.400 --> 18:19.600]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market
[18:19.600 --> 18:23.040]  with organic essential oils on top of it.
[18:23.040 --> 18:27.480]  And there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[18:27.480 --> 18:31.800]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo,
[18:31.800 --> 18:34.280]  but it's high quality and aerosolizes it
[18:34.280 --> 18:35.120]  in a really great way.
[18:35.120 --> 18:38.320]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[18:38.320 --> 18:39.760]  It's got organic alcohol in it,
[18:39.760 --> 18:41.120]  so spray it around your eyes.
[18:41.120 --> 18:43.320]  But I just love it, personally,
[18:43.320 --> 18:45.400]  it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[18:45.400 --> 18:47.320]  So, this is a real innovation.
[18:47.320 --> 18:49.040]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out
[18:49.040 --> 18:51.480]  with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[18:51.480 --> 18:53.680]  essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out,
[18:53.680 --> 18:55.120]  it smells great.
[18:55.120 --> 18:58.040]  It's so refreshing, this is a big winner.
[19:00.200 --> 19:03.200]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day,
[19:03.200 --> 19:05.160]  convenience is key.
[19:05.160 --> 19:08.680]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar filled drinks
[19:08.680 --> 19:10.520]  can give you a short boost.
[19:10.520 --> 19:13.120]  But the crash always follows.
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.680]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula
[19:16.680 --> 19:19.440]  to take on the go when you need a little help.
[19:19.440 --> 19:20.680]  Turboforce.
[19:20.680 --> 19:23.320]  Similar to other mix and energy packets,
[19:23.320 --> 19:25.440]  Turboforce from Infowars Life
[19:25.440 --> 19:28.440]  utilizes vitamins, amino acids,
[19:28.440 --> 19:31.320]  and extracts used for hundreds of years
[19:31.320 --> 19:35.080]  across the world to provide focus, clarity,
[19:35.080 --> 19:37.360]  and a boost of energy when you need it.
[19:37.360 --> 19:39.600]  Turboforce is certainly a force
[19:39.600 --> 19:42.640]  to be reckoned with for portable, affordable,
[19:42.640 --> 19:44.400]  and tasty energy.
[19:44.400 --> 19:45.920]  And speaking of affordable,
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.040]  you can even try Turboforce for a limited time
[19:49.040 --> 19:51.880]  at an incredible 40% off.
[19:51.880 --> 19:54.240]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again
[19:54.240 --> 19:56.520]  and get Turboforce right now,
[19:56.520 --> 19:59.880]  only at InfowarsStore.com.
[19:59.880 --> 20:06.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:20.560 --> 20:23.400]  We align ourselves with the truth,
[20:23.400 --> 20:26.400]  and it's time for you to choose a side.
[20:26.400 --> 20:29.960]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[20:32.520 --> 20:35.080]  We were actually all born for this.
[20:35.080 --> 20:37.760]  I know I was.
[20:37.760 --> 20:40.360]  And now the mission's clear.
[20:40.360 --> 20:43.480]  And all the preparation is leading us all
[20:43.480 --> 20:46.320]  to this confrontational moment with evil.
[20:46.320 --> 20:52.600]  This is the time that all of us were created for.
[20:52.600 --> 20:55.320]  All right, let's lay it out right now.
[20:55.320 --> 20:58.400]  We're at total information overload, just like you are.
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.080]  There are so many videos of black people
[21:03.080 --> 21:06.320]  all over the United States who are the majority
[21:06.320 --> 21:09.480]  in their community saying,
[21:09.480 --> 21:11.960]  the police on average are very helpful.
[21:11.960 --> 21:13.080]  There are some bad cops.
[21:13.080 --> 21:17.520]  Every time they do something wrong, they go to jail, basically.
[21:17.520 --> 21:19.800]  The people financing all this rioting
[21:19.800 --> 21:22.000]  are not even from the town we're in.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.240]  I've got like 15 videos, not even trying,
[21:24.240 --> 21:25.200]  right here I can play.
[21:25.200 --> 21:27.240]  You've all seen them.
[21:27.240 --> 21:28.600]  And that means there's not bad cops.
[21:28.600 --> 21:29.960]  I've had bad cops.
[21:29.960 --> 21:31.040]  I've run into bad cops.
[21:31.040 --> 21:33.600]  I had cops when I grew up in Dallas that were corrupt.
[21:33.600 --> 21:35.080]  You know, mess with me.
[21:35.080 --> 21:36.600]  I mean, I get it.
[21:36.600 --> 21:38.200]  But they're just like people anywhere.
[21:38.200 --> 21:39.720]  There's bad people anywhere.
[21:39.720 --> 21:42.200]  Who's pushing all of this?
[21:42.200 --> 21:43.640]  What's the larger agenda?
[21:43.640 --> 21:46.680]  If you think cops are where the buck stops
[21:46.680 --> 21:49.320]  and they're the ones you should attack,
[21:49.320 --> 21:52.720]  well, that's just people trying to break down society.
[21:52.720 --> 21:54.080]  I'm not for offensive violence,
[21:54.080 --> 21:56.360]  but if I saw people attacking Democrats' houses
[21:56.360 --> 21:58.680]  or going after them or going after globalists,
[21:58.680 --> 22:00.200]  I'd say, well, you're at least you're going after
[22:00.200 --> 22:03.800]  who runs it, puts the Democrats in,
[22:03.800 --> 22:05.840]  go to Republicans' houses, you notice.
[22:06.840 --> 22:08.680]  So they're trying to cause a civil war
[22:08.680 --> 22:10.280]  because they're losing.
[22:10.280 --> 22:12.000]  And they totally bet on communist China
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.360]  and try to transfer all our power there.
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.080]  And you've got, again, the Minneapolis police chief,
[22:17.080 --> 22:19.400]  you've got all of them coming home,
[22:19.400 --> 22:22.400]  including the governor saying, these are out-of-town people.
[22:22.400 --> 22:25.480]  Well, it turns out the governor's daughter
[22:25.480 --> 22:29.200]  was caught directing Antifa and bus loads
[22:29.200 --> 22:31.480]  of out-of-town people actually attacking.
[22:32.880 --> 22:35.240]  So it doesn't mean that what happened
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.520]  to this poor man that got killed isn't wrong.
[22:39.600 --> 22:42.200]  They're using that as the pretext
[22:43.120 --> 22:45.680]  for the breakdown of society further.
[22:45.680 --> 22:48.000]  And that doesn't help anybody.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  The cops arrested, he's indicted.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.320]  So what's all this in so-called rioting about?
[22:53.320 --> 22:54.840]  It's not about injustice.
[22:54.840 --> 22:56.720]  It's not about standing up for what's right.
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.800]  It's about control and power.
[22:58.800 --> 23:02.520]  And it's all led, if you go out on the LA streets
[23:02.520 --> 23:04.800]  or the Austin streets or the Minnesota streets,
[23:04.800 --> 23:07.480]  I've been on the Texas streets the last two days.
[23:07.480 --> 23:09.680]  But I see the videos from all over the country, man,
[23:09.680 --> 23:11.320]  and it's a bunch of white people.
[23:11.320 --> 23:14.040]  And I'm not trying to bash white people.
[23:14.040 --> 23:15.740]  I'm not bashing any racial group.
[23:17.240 --> 23:19.480]  But if I saw, it was mainly black folks doing it,
[23:19.480 --> 23:21.280]  I'd say it's black people.
[23:21.280 --> 23:22.680]  It was Hispanics, I'd say it's Hispanic.
[23:22.680 --> 23:24.200]  I just tell you what I see.
[23:24.200 --> 23:27.880]  It's a bunch of meth-head devil worshiping white people
[23:27.880 --> 23:31.040]  that are all university professors and government workers
[23:31.040 --> 23:32.800]  that think they're gonna run everything
[23:32.800 --> 23:35.160]  and they just think black people are stupid.
[23:35.160 --> 23:37.520]  And they're literally there telling you,
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.520]  you've gotta have a communist uprising
[23:39.520 --> 23:41.240]  and there's gonna be this great panacea
[23:41.240 --> 23:44.960]  when these basement dwelling, cave-dwelling meth-heads
[23:44.960 --> 23:49.840]  take control of the world.
[23:49.840 --> 23:51.160]  So if I went to one of these events
[23:51.160 --> 23:53.000]  and I saw a bunch of Mexicans running it,
[23:53.000 --> 23:54.840]  I'd say we got a Mexican problem.
[23:54.840 --> 23:56.080]  It's the Mexicans.
[23:56.080 --> 23:57.000]  But you know what?
[23:57.000 --> 23:58.720]  We don't have a Mexican problem.
[23:58.720 --> 24:00.400]  We don't have a black person problem.
[24:00.400 --> 24:02.960]  We got a white crack-head problem.
[24:03.960 --> 24:05.280]  All right, I'm starting to go.
[24:05.280 --> 24:06.120]  I got all these clips.
[24:06.120 --> 24:07.160]  I need to get these clips.
[24:07.160 --> 24:07.960]  Because let me tell you, man,
[24:07.960 --> 24:09.680]  I spent hours last night today.
[24:09.680 --> 24:12.040]  I've just so much amazing stuff at infowords.com,
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.200]  which is only there.
[24:13.200 --> 24:15.560]  We're banned on Twitter, Facebook, Google, everywhere.
[24:15.560 --> 24:17.440]  Everywhere we drove around the armored vehicle today,
[24:17.440 --> 24:20.320]  the left one, F you, you're off Twitter and Facebook,
[24:20.320 --> 24:21.600]  you don't matter.
[24:22.520 --> 24:24.600]  Our listeners think we matter and they matter.
[24:24.600 --> 24:25.440]  And you know what?
[24:25.440 --> 24:28.000]  We get millions of views a day outside of your ass.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  And that's why they successfully hacked newswords.com today.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.080]  Antifa did, like posted pictures of pigs and the police
[24:35.080 --> 24:36.520]  and said we're gonna kill the police
[24:36.520 --> 24:40.320]  and then the unabomber crap.
[24:40.320 --> 24:43.040]  Yeah, they took over one of our sites today.
[24:43.040 --> 24:46.960]  Because these people are anti-free speech, fundamentally.
[24:46.960 --> 24:47.880]  Now there it is.
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.720]  So it just goes on and on and on and on.
[24:55.800 --> 24:58.440]  This is the big coming takeover.
[24:58.440 --> 25:01.920]  Financed by billionaire Jeff Bezos
[25:01.920 --> 25:04.800]  and the Clintons and the globalists and the chai comms.
[25:04.800 --> 25:09.240]  I mean, people thinking the most authoritarian evil folks,
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.240]  the history of this world are the guys trying to save them.
[25:15.160 --> 25:17.440]  You think some cold-blooded multi-billionaire
[25:17.440 --> 25:19.880]  that's funding communism cares about you?
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.240]  They know communism will control you
[25:22.240 --> 25:23.960]  and gets you out of the way.
[25:23.960 --> 25:26.880]  Trump wants a true economy and to empower you.
[25:26.880 --> 25:29.680]  And by the way, I said I get to all these clips this segment,
[25:29.680 --> 25:30.960]  I'll get to them next segment.
[25:30.960 --> 25:32.080]  And boy, we have a lot.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.680]  We have the deep state delivering pallets,
[25:35.680 --> 25:40.680]  15 bricks tall in front of the police department in Dallas.
[25:44.720 --> 25:49.720]  And the black folks, the people see right down through it.
[25:52.920 --> 25:56.320]  And so this is not about kissing the black people's asses.
[25:56.320 --> 25:57.320]  I just covered the facts.
[25:57.320 --> 25:59.400]  I kissed the truth's ass.
[25:59.400 --> 26:01.440]  Black folks on average aren't doing this.
[26:01.440 --> 26:03.040]  You've got some thugs and gangsters
[26:03.040 --> 26:04.960]  that mentally ill people like in every group
[26:04.960 --> 26:08.800]  that are out there, but it's like 5% of the rioters are black.
[26:08.800 --> 26:12.160]  So if a movement's about justice for black people,
[26:12.160 --> 26:14.320]  where are the black people?
[26:14.320 --> 26:15.320]  It's not the black people.
[26:15.320 --> 26:18.720]  They're like, what's this pallet of bricks doing right here?
[26:18.720 --> 26:21.320]  We got footage in New York and not all police are corrupt,
[26:21.320 --> 26:23.840]  but some false flag in New York's classic for this.
[26:23.840 --> 26:25.520]  You got very creepy footage,
[26:25.520 --> 26:27.720]  looking like the police are setting fire to vans.
[26:27.720 --> 26:28.880]  I'm not saying that's what they're doing.
[26:28.880 --> 26:30.640]  It just, we're gonna cover it all, folks.
[26:30.640 --> 26:37.160]  We're gonna ask the questions here tonight.
[26:37.160 --> 26:39.720]  Because the truth is my North Star.
[26:39.720 --> 26:42.480]  Asking those questions is the North Star.
[26:42.480 --> 26:44.480]  And I'm not gonna sit here and watch black people.
[26:44.480 --> 26:47.000]  And it's not some virtue signal for me.
[26:47.000 --> 26:47.960]  It's the truth.
[26:47.960 --> 26:52.840]  I'm not gonna sit here and watch a bunch of black folks
[26:52.840 --> 26:56.120]  scapegoated for what a bunch of meth head left us to,
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.120]  with a bunch of Soros funded trash.
[26:58.120 --> 27:01.920]  When I have all the documents that in 2015,
[27:01.920 --> 27:04.880]  Soros tried to get black people to riot nationwide
[27:04.880 --> 27:07.520]  and hired groups of people working with Blue City
[27:07.520 --> 27:10.160]  police departments to actually stage it
[27:10.160 --> 27:12.920]  to cause an uprising that would cancel the election.
[27:16.560 --> 27:19.440]  That doesn't take away that there's some racist black people
[27:19.440 --> 27:21.400]  that are out of control that need to be dealt with.
[27:21.400 --> 27:23.400]  There's some racist white people that gotta be dealt with.
[27:23.400 --> 27:26.920]  I'm talking about the big picture here, folks.
[27:26.920 --> 27:29.400]  And if you really wanna defeat the globalist
[27:29.400 --> 27:30.960]  and defeat these slime bags,
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.760]  or whether you wanna keep playing to their tune,
[27:33.760 --> 27:35.760]  you wanna be real, or you wanna be a puppet,
[27:35.760 --> 27:36.960]  I'm gonna go to break.
[27:38.280 --> 27:39.280]  And we come back.
[27:40.840 --> 27:42.960]  We have pallet of bricks being delivered
[27:42.960 --> 27:44.560]  to protesters in Dallas.
[27:44.560 --> 27:45.640]  We have St. Paul mayor,
[27:45.640 --> 27:48.320]  everyone arrested last night was from outside town.
[27:49.480 --> 27:51.800]  We have a protestor melting down and we have,
[27:51.800 --> 27:52.920]  it's like a 20 minute video,
[27:52.920 --> 27:54.200]  but I'll play like a minute of it.
[27:54.200 --> 27:59.200]  A poor homeless guy where Antifa grabs his tent and bed
[27:59.400 --> 28:01.560]  and is burning it and he's begging them
[28:01.560 --> 28:03.640]  and they just punch him in the face because he's white.
[28:03.640 --> 28:05.080]  But they're white too.
[28:06.360 --> 28:08.040]  It's all coming up, man.
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.080]  This is insane.
[28:11.080 --> 28:12.000]  And this is real.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.360]  And we're not supposed to be here.
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.640]  We're supposed to be gone in the ditch,
[28:15.640 --> 28:19.920]  not have TV, satellite, not have radio satellite on the roof,
[28:19.920 --> 28:21.360]  not have millions of viewers right now.
[28:21.360 --> 28:22.920]  We're supposed to be gone already,
[28:22.920 --> 28:24.360]  but we're here because of you.
[28:24.360 --> 28:25.840]  You did this listeners.
[28:25.840 --> 28:28.080]  And this isn't about kissing your ass either.
[28:28.080 --> 28:30.080]  It's about kissing the truth ass.
[28:30.080 --> 28:31.640]  You kicked butt.
[28:32.480 --> 28:35.680]  You kept us on air through hell the last few years.
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.920]  And I'll give myself credit.
[28:36.920 --> 28:39.040]  I went through some stuff too, but you know what?
[28:39.040 --> 28:41.560]  They're not gonna drive me off the truth.
[28:41.560 --> 28:42.400]  And we did it.
[28:42.400 --> 28:44.960]  And now we're on air and we're about to do stuff
[28:44.960 --> 28:47.760]  that they never wanted out there.
[28:47.760 --> 28:50.160]  Cause they want white people hating black people.
[28:50.160 --> 28:52.080]  And they want black people hating white people.
[28:52.080 --> 28:53.280]  And they want all this.
[28:53.280 --> 28:54.720]  Well, guess what?
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.000]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[29:01.840 --> 29:04.360]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[29:04.360 --> 29:06.800]  And I've told folks going back three months ago,
[29:06.800 --> 29:08.640]  I'm not buying horrible food
[29:08.640 --> 29:10.200]  cause I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[29:10.200 --> 29:11.840]  I'm worried about the food shortages
[29:11.840 --> 29:13.040]  and the economic collapse.
[29:13.040 --> 29:15.880]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun
[29:15.880 --> 29:17.600]  that's already caused food shortages
[29:17.600 --> 29:19.320]  and the collapse of farms and ranches
[29:19.320 --> 29:20.480]  across the United States.
[29:20.480 --> 29:22.040]  And that's even worse in the third world.
[29:22.040 --> 29:23.720]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives,
[29:23.720 --> 29:24.960]  could clean this up and fix it.
[29:24.960 --> 29:27.760]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19,
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.080]  all the wars and the third world collapsing
[29:30.080 --> 29:31.400]  and everything else is going on,
[29:31.400 --> 29:33.800]  now is the time to get storeable foods
[29:33.800 --> 29:35.680]  because they'll last for 25 years.
[29:35.680 --> 29:37.640]  They're in easily totable bags.
[29:37.640 --> 29:38.640]  It's high quality food.
[29:38.640 --> 29:41.120]  And it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[29:41.120 --> 29:42.240]  And it funds the InfoWars.

[29:47.000 --> 29:48.080]  three, three, one, three, nine.
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.960]  But whatever you do, get prepared and get ready
[29:49.960 --> 29:52.240]  because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[29:52.240 --> 29:54.240]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.

[29:57.280 --> 29:58.160]  while you still can.
[30:00.720 --> 30:03.880]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[30:03.880 --> 30:07.560]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[30:07.560 --> 30:10.480]  their basic rights being suspended
[30:10.480 --> 30:14.720]  and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO
[30:14.720 --> 30:18.560]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in full control.
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.680]  Many will submit through fear.
[30:20.680 --> 30:22.480]  Others will be bought off.
[30:22.480 --> 30:24.840]  But in the end, the globalists admit
[30:24.840 --> 30:27.880]  they're building a post-human world.
[30:27.880 --> 30:30.000]  And now that we're inside the cage,
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.400]  it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[30:34.400 --> 30:38.160]  Submission to this is a form of living death
[30:38.160 --> 30:41.920]  and committing the next generation and our own generation
[30:41.920 --> 30:45.400]  to a living hell that cannot be imagined

[30:55.240 --> 30:57.120]  taking full control of humanity
[30:57.120 --> 31:00.200]  for its own selfless, disgusting power trip.

[32:06.360 --> 32:07.320]  but we're having to end that one
[32:07.320 --> 32:09.160]  because a bunch of items are selling out.
[32:09.160 --> 32:10.560]  But all the items we have left in stock
[32:10.560 --> 32:12.560]  are still on record sale.
[32:12.560 --> 32:14.640]  And then five items that weren't on sale
[32:14.640 --> 32:17.240]  that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted
[32:17.240 --> 32:19.600]  as well for the Memorial Day special.

[32:47.640 --> 32:49.320]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[32:49.320 --> 32:52.120]  We appreciate your support, your financial support,
[32:52.120 --> 32:53.560]  but it's also supported you and your family
[32:53.560 --> 32:55.240]  with amazing products that are so good
[32:55.240 --> 32:56.120]  for you and your body.
[32:56.120 --> 32:57.640]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[32:57.640 --> 32:59.040]  We are all in this together.
[33:02.880 --> 33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:06.000 --> 33:06.840]  $1,600.
[33:22.080 --> 33:23.320]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[33:23.320 --> 33:25.720]  I'm Alan Jones, your host on this Live Sunday show.
[33:25.720 --> 33:29.440]  So we've seen every multinational corporate attempt
[33:29.440 --> 33:31.680]  for the media to overthrow the United States.
[33:31.680 --> 33:32.600]  We're the big prize.
[33:32.600 --> 33:34.080]  They have no respect for us.
[33:34.080 --> 33:36.720]  We've put up with them telling us that boys can be girls,
[33:36.720 --> 33:39.280]  girls can be boys, the world government's good,
[33:39.280 --> 33:40.640]  that Jesus doesn't exist,
[33:40.640 --> 33:42.960]  that Doris Washington was a bad person.
[33:45.400 --> 33:46.880]  And they've set up one side of trade deals
[33:46.880 --> 33:47.720]  in the communist China,
[33:47.720 --> 33:50.520]  that totally the industrialized the United States.
[33:51.480 --> 33:55.320]  And so now they sit there and they cherry pick any event
[33:55.320 --> 33:57.680]  out of 350 million Americans
[33:57.680 --> 33:58.640]  where they can then say,
[33:58.640 --> 34:02.080]  oh, a white guy did something wrong to a black person.
[34:02.080 --> 34:03.800]  In fact, I had this yesterday, guys,
[34:03.800 --> 34:05.320]  and I haven't covered it for over a week.
[34:05.320 --> 34:07.200]  Well, you pull me the black on white statistic numbers
[34:07.200 --> 34:08.920]  from your state police, thanks.
[34:08.920 --> 34:10.600]  And again, the average black person is not bad,
[34:10.600 --> 34:13.200]  but it's 10 to one against whites.
[34:13.200 --> 34:15.880]  That's the statistics.
[34:15.880 --> 34:18.000]  But the media would have you believe that white people
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.520]  are running around with like giant fangs
[34:20.520 --> 34:21.680]  to eat the black people.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.080]  So, here's in Dallas,
[34:25.080 --> 34:28.000]  protester identifies a pallet of bricks
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.600]  set in front of the courthouse
[34:30.960 --> 34:32.880]  as a setup for people to get in trouble.
[34:32.880 --> 34:35.480]  It turns out this is happening nationwide.
[34:35.480 --> 34:36.800]  Here it is.
[34:36.800 --> 34:37.880]  This right here.
[34:37.880 --> 34:38.720]  Yeah.
[34:38.720 --> 34:39.880]  This is the setup.
[34:39.880 --> 34:40.720]  They put them there on purpose.
[34:40.720 --> 34:41.800]  Y'all know where we at?
[34:41.800 --> 34:43.600]  They gonna set them on right up on the round.
[34:43.600 --> 34:45.200]  Y'all know what building this is right here.
[34:45.200 --> 34:46.600]  I ain't even gonna say what name it is.
[34:46.600 --> 34:48.000]  Hey, where do them bricks go to?
[34:48.000 --> 34:48.840]  Where do them bricks go to?
[34:48.840 --> 34:49.680]  This is the setup.
[34:49.680 --> 34:50.520]  Where do them bricks go to?
[34:50.520 --> 34:51.360]  We gotta do better.
[34:51.360 --> 34:52.200]  Ain't no damn construction.
[34:52.200 --> 34:53.040]  We gotta do better.
[34:53.040 --> 34:54.080]  Ain't no damn construction around here.
[34:54.080 --> 34:54.920]  I see.
[34:54.920 --> 34:56.160]  Ain't no damn construction around here.
[34:56.160 --> 34:57.920]  You just gonna set up pallet of bricks right there.
[34:57.920 --> 34:58.760]  Oh, okay.
[34:58.760 --> 35:01.480]  Listen, I did jewelry duty three months ago.
[35:01.480 --> 35:03.600]  Y'all don't keep no bricks right there.
[35:03.600 --> 35:04.440]  Do better.
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.600]  So there's bricks just laid out for everybody.
[35:10.600 --> 35:12.040]  Here's the St. Paul mayor.
[35:12.040 --> 35:14.280]  Everyone arrested last night in the city
[35:14.280 --> 35:15.760]  came from out of state.
[35:15.760 --> 35:16.600]  Here it is.
[35:23.600 --> 35:24.680]  I like that buildup.
[35:27.760 --> 35:29.440]  We got a clip broken in the computer.
[35:29.440 --> 35:30.280]  No big deal.
[35:30.280 --> 35:32.120]  Whenever we're ready with that,
[35:32.120 --> 35:34.080]  clip 21, the St. Paul mayor,
[35:34.080 --> 35:36.160]  everyone arrested last night in the city.
[35:37.720 --> 35:40.280]  All right, well, we'll go to clip a protester.
[35:41.320 --> 35:44.880]  Absolutely melts down, screaming at the Fox News asking,
[35:44.880 --> 35:46.320]  why are we looting?
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.080]  And then the next clip is in Austin,
[35:48.080 --> 35:51.160]  a homeless man having his bed taken away
[35:51.160 --> 35:52.960]  and burned by Auntie for, here it is.
[35:54.480 --> 35:56.320]  Marty, what is the intent?
[35:56.320 --> 35:59.120]  When you shoot somebody, you're not shooting to,
[35:59.120 --> 36:01.680]  you know, I'm not understanding what the,
[36:01.680 --> 36:03.080]  that's not what he said though.
[36:03.080 --> 36:06.160]  When the looting starts, you think looting should be allowed.
[36:06.160 --> 36:07.000]  Looting should be allowed?
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.560]  Look, why do you think we're looting in the first place?
[36:08.560 --> 36:09.960]  Why are we looting?
[36:09.960 --> 36:11.360]  Why are we looting?
[36:11.360 --> 36:12.480]  Okay, why are we looting?
[36:12.480 --> 36:13.320]  Tell me.
[36:13.320 --> 36:14.480]  Do you know why we're looting?
[36:14.480 --> 36:15.320]  Okay, okay.
[36:15.320 --> 36:17.640]  This is a game, Alan, this is a game.
[36:17.640 --> 36:20.800]  So, okay, so you can see just how angry this crowd is,
[36:20.800 --> 36:23.200]  Shannon, is there a kind of sort of pushy-ass round?
[36:24.760 --> 36:26.200]  So again, ladies and gentlemen,
[36:26.200 --> 36:29.560]  they can show you one image of a black guy being killed
[36:29.560 --> 36:31.520]  when there's seven and a half billion people on the planet
[36:31.520 --> 36:34.360]  and say like, you need to go out and burn stuff down.
[36:34.360 --> 36:36.480]  You need to go out and do all this.
[36:36.480 --> 36:37.520]  Who's doing that?
[36:37.520 --> 36:39.240]  Who runs the US media?
[36:40.120 --> 36:42.240]  Well, the US has been an open economy
[36:42.240 --> 36:44.280]  and so it's a lot of foreign banks,
[36:44.280 --> 36:46.360]  a lot of foreign countries.
[36:46.360 --> 36:48.520]  And so I'm just asking everybody,
[36:48.520 --> 36:51.800]  do you think rioting when the foreign banks say so
[36:51.800 --> 36:52.960]  is a good idea?
[36:52.960 --> 36:54.080]  And the answer is no.
[36:54.080 --> 36:55.800]  I'm just up here.
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.200]  My job is very easy.
[36:57.200 --> 36:58.280]  I just promote freedom.
[36:59.480 --> 37:00.760]  I see something I think is wrong.
[37:00.760 --> 37:01.840]  I expose it.
[37:01.840 --> 37:03.120]  I see something I think is good.
[37:03.120 --> 37:04.040]  I talk about it.
[37:05.640 --> 37:08.760]  But we sit here as a society and as a culture
[37:08.760 --> 37:13.760]  and they know we're moral people.
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.200]  So they use the fact that we care about moral issues
[37:19.200 --> 37:23.400]  against us.
[37:24.600 --> 37:26.640]  And so all day like, oh, don't you wanna be moral?
[37:26.640 --> 37:27.760]  Do what I say.
[37:27.760 --> 37:28.600]  Don't you wanna be moral?
[37:28.600 --> 37:29.720]  Follow my orders.
[37:30.960 --> 37:32.800]  Don't you wanna be moral?
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.080]  Follow my edict or I'm gonna say you're a bad person.
[37:38.080 --> 37:39.800]  This is like religion.
[37:39.800 --> 37:41.400]  And that's what leftist systems are.
[37:41.400 --> 37:43.560]  It's like a weird cult religion.
[37:44.680 --> 37:47.800]  So here is now loading the St. Paul mayor
[37:47.800 --> 37:49.520]  saying everyone arrested last night
[37:49.520 --> 37:50.360]  is from outside the state.
[37:50.360 --> 37:51.600]  Here it is.
[37:51.600 --> 37:54.080]  We didn't make an enormous number of arrests,
[37:55.280 --> 37:57.680]  but every single person we arrested last night,
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.040]  I'm told was from out of state.
[38:03.680 --> 38:08.680]  What we are seeing right now is a group of people
[38:10.920 --> 38:11.920]  who are not from here.
[38:12.920 --> 38:16.360]  As I talked to my friends who have been in this movement
[38:16.360 --> 38:18.160]  for a very long time who wake up
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.920]  in this movement every day
[38:19.920 --> 38:22.040]  and I ask them what they're seeing,
[38:22.040 --> 38:25.560]  what they're feeling, what they're hearing to a person.
[38:25.560 --> 38:28.760]  I hear them say, we don't know these folks.
[38:28.760 --> 38:30.240]  We don't know these folks who are agitated.
[38:30.240 --> 38:32.240]  We don't know these folks who are inciting violence.
[38:32.240 --> 38:35.920]  We don't know these folks who are first in the breaker window.
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.040]  And those folks who are agitating and inciting
[38:40.040 --> 38:45.040]  are taking advantage of the pain,
[38:47.280 --> 38:48.680]  of the hurt, of the frustration,
[38:48.680 --> 38:52.120]  of the anger, of the very real and legitimate sadness
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.680]  that so many of our community members feel.
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.760]  You know, what's weird about the sign language thing
[39:00.760 --> 39:03.280]  is they have a button you can push on any computer or TV
[39:03.280 --> 39:05.320]  to like bring up the sign language box.
[39:05.320 --> 39:06.520]  Like always you gotta have it there.
[39:06.520 --> 39:10.240]  It's like a distraction from what they're saying.
[39:10.240 --> 39:12.720]  Here is the video we were talking about.
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.640]  We now have that for you.
[39:14.640 --> 39:16.440]  We'll just go to the next club here at us.
[39:19.080 --> 39:20.440]  This is the homeless man,
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.240]  because Antifa needs more stuff to burn to act powerful.
[39:27.240 --> 39:28.920]  So they grab a homeless man's bed
[39:30.280 --> 39:33.600]  and he comes over later, explains,
[39:33.600 --> 39:36.760]  and Antifa says, sorry, you're white, you deserve this.
[39:38.480 --> 39:40.280]  So this is the methad party.
[39:40.280 --> 39:41.880]  What are you doing?
[39:41.880 --> 39:43.680]  What the fuck are you doing?
[39:43.680 --> 39:44.520]  Fire!
[39:44.520 --> 39:49.520]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:49.520 --> 39:54.520]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:59.760 --> 40:03.720]  Okay, so that's where we are on this Sunday night.
[40:06.520 --> 40:10.600]  That's where we are as a society, as a culture.
[40:12.440 --> 40:13.560]  Now let's air this piece.
[40:13.560 --> 40:17.120]  Media fans the flames of race war in Minneapolis.
[40:17.120 --> 40:18.520]  Let's play that club as we go to break.
[40:18.520 --> 40:19.520]  Here it is.
[40:27.520 --> 40:30.200]  I have never seen anything like this.
[40:30.200 --> 40:31.960]  The building's beginning to collapse.
[40:31.960 --> 40:33.640]  The building is collapsing.
[40:33.640 --> 40:34.960]  The building just exploded.
[40:34.960 --> 40:35.800]  Oh my God.
[40:37.120 --> 40:38.040]  And it just collapsed.
[40:38.040 --> 40:39.000]  There you go.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.120]  The building just collapsed in the midsection as well.
[40:42.120 --> 40:45.200]  People are taught the collapse of civilization
[40:45.200 --> 40:47.200]  is victory by Soros,
[40:47.200 --> 40:49.000]  because they already bought the planet up.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.240]  I want to be clear on how I characterize this.
[40:51.240 --> 40:54.120]  This is mostly a protest.
[40:54.120 --> 40:57.800]  It is not, it is not generally speaking, unruly.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.320]  It is not unruly.
[41:06.320 --> 41:08.640]  When we start coming to the suburbs,
[41:08.640 --> 41:10.240]  when we come to the government center,
[41:10.240 --> 41:11.360]  then what's all I'm going to do?
[41:11.360 --> 41:12.320]  You see what I'm saying?
[41:12.320 --> 41:17.320]  So, hey, that's just what's going to happen, you know?
[41:20.960 --> 41:23.640]  Civilization had to fall, and it will.
[41:23.640 --> 41:24.480]  Don't worry.
[41:25.960 --> 41:27.160]  That's why you got to move the country
[41:27.160 --> 41:28.400]  and dig in and get ready folks.
[41:28.400 --> 41:30.280]  It's all going to collapse.
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.120]  It all fails.
[41:33.240 --> 41:34.960]  Satanism is now what we do.
[41:34.960 --> 41:39.960]  Proud to support people only makes them at you more.
[41:43.960 --> 41:45.960]  Yet to withdraw from the system.
[41:50.960 --> 41:55.960]  It is not incumbent upon black people to stop racism,
[41:55.960 --> 41:56.960]  to stop this.
[41:56.960 --> 41:58.960]  It is incumbent upon people who hold the power
[41:58.960 --> 42:00.960]  in this society to help.
[42:00.960 --> 42:02.960]  He means submit to his views.
[42:02.960 --> 42:04.960]  Not about black people, he pimps blacks.
[42:04.960 --> 42:05.960]  Who is that, Chris?
[42:05.960 --> 42:06.960]  White people.
[42:06.960 --> 42:08.960]  White people, Cuomo.
[42:09.960 --> 42:10.960]  Good job, Cuomo.
[42:12.960 --> 42:13.960]  You and your mafia family.
[42:14.960 --> 42:16.960]  Our young generation is clearly lost, man.
[42:16.960 --> 42:17.960]  Clearly lost, man.
[42:17.960 --> 42:19.960]  Like, I don't even know what to say no more, man.
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.960]  Like, you youngsters just going around, just busting guns,
[42:23.960 --> 42:25.960]  in crowds, kids getting killed.
[42:25.960 --> 42:28.960]  You know, and it's clearly the generation after us, man.
[42:28.960 --> 42:29.960]  They're still lost, man.
[42:29.960 --> 42:30.960]  What's going on?
[42:32.960 --> 42:33.960]  Don't worry, folks.
[42:34.960 --> 42:36.960]  The free society you've been pissing on is gone.
[42:38.960 --> 42:40.960]  It's all gone now.
[42:41.960 --> 42:43.960]  It's all going to be gone soon.
[42:44.960 --> 42:45.960]  What the hell is going to be?
[42:45.960 --> 42:47.960]  You and God, you and up, and you're going down.
[42:47.960 --> 42:48.960]  You know what I'm saying?
[42:48.960 --> 42:49.960]  That's going to be it.
[42:49.960 --> 42:50.960]  I can't breathe.
[42:50.960 --> 42:52.960]  I can't breathe.
[42:52.960 --> 42:53.960]  I can't breathe.
[42:53.960 --> 42:54.960]  I can't breathe.
[42:54.960 --> 42:59.960]  I can't breathe in these Fauci masks.
[43:24.960 --> 43:28.960]  It's got high-quality PQQ, CoQ10, and a bunch of other natural
[43:28.960 --> 43:31.960]  ingredients that are known to supercharge the effects of that.
[43:31.960 --> 43:36.960]  Learn what PQQ and CoQ10 can do for you, no matter how old you are,
[43:36.960 --> 43:39.960]  no matter what color you are, no matter where you live in the world,
[43:39.960 --> 43:42.960]  it works the same on everybody.
[43:42.960 --> 43:44.960]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[43:44.960 --> 43:48.960]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[43:48.960 --> 43:49.960]  Doesn't make them grow.
[43:49.960 --> 43:52.960]  Makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[43:52.960 --> 43:58.960]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at infowarstore.com.
[44:00.960 --> 44:02.960]  What are champions made of?
[44:03.960 --> 44:05.960]  Here's a man who can show you.
[44:05.960 --> 44:16.960]  I'll show you.
[44:35.960 --> 45:02.960]  This is the end, my friends.
[45:02.960 --> 45:05.960]  The end, my only friends, the end.
[45:05.960 --> 45:07.960]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[45:07.960 --> 45:10.960]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.960]  The safety, the delusion.
[45:13.960 --> 45:15.960]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen,
[45:15.960 --> 45:18.960]  because it was only the mirage of safety.
[45:18.960 --> 45:22.960]  Movies and partying and living like children,
[45:22.960 --> 45:25.960]  never growing up, never caring about other people.
[45:25.960 --> 45:28.960]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[45:28.960 --> 45:31.960]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states,
[45:31.960 --> 45:35.960]  every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God,
[45:35.960 --> 45:37.960]  they were brought into captivity
[45:37.960 --> 45:41.960]  because their people sold out to special interests
[45:41.960 --> 45:44.960]  and were infiltrated by spies, and then they were enslaved.
[45:44.960 --> 45:47.960]  We are repeating that again today.
[45:47.960 --> 45:52.960]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[45:52.960 --> 45:55.960]  Info Wars has decided to fight for freedom.
[45:55.960 --> 45:59.960]  Info Wars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[45:59.960 --> 46:03.960]  The United States is not communist China.
[46:03.960 --> 46:06.960]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[46:06.960 --> 46:08.960]  We don't blow up churches.
[46:08.960 --> 46:11.960]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[46:11.960 --> 46:15.960]  But all over the news, we see the UN, billable indicates,
[46:15.960 --> 46:17.960]  WHO, mainstream corporate media,
[46:17.960 --> 46:20.960]  praising communist China for their response.
[46:20.960 --> 46:23.960]  And if communist China shoots women at checkpoints
[46:23.960 --> 46:26.960]  and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people,
[46:26.960 --> 46:29.960]  well, then gee, we've got to do that.
[46:29.960 --> 46:31.960]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying,
[46:31.960 --> 46:34.960]  we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[46:34.960 --> 46:37.960]  Well, now Cuomo in New York is calling it the European virus.
[46:37.960 --> 46:40.960]  These people are out of control, control freaks,
[46:40.960 --> 46:42.960]  and they are going to lose big time
[46:42.960 --> 46:45.960]  because we the people are aware of their criminal activities
[46:45.960 --> 46:47.960]  and are exposing them in their power grab.
[46:47.960 --> 46:51.960]  The Resistance lives at band.video and infowars.com.
[46:51.960 --> 46:54.960]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats
[46:54.960 --> 46:58.960]  and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[46:58.960 --> 47:21.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:28.960 --> 47:48.960]  All right, let's hear from a communist in Austin, Texas,
[47:48.960 --> 47:51.960]  with Savannah Hernandez reporter interviewing him
[47:51.960 --> 48:00.960]  about the dream world run by communist or anarchist.
[48:00.960 --> 48:03.960]  Where do you think we go after this?
[48:03.960 --> 48:07.960]  What do you think happens next?
[48:07.960 --> 48:10.960]  Well, there's another demonstration tomorrow.
[48:10.960 --> 48:13.960]  Like I said, these demonstrations are a way of showing solidarity,
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.960]  but the only way to actually change the system is to increase self-governance.
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.960]  So that means get involved with organizations like Food Not Bombs,
[48:23.960 --> 48:27.960]  with local anarchists or communist organizations,
[48:27.960 --> 48:29.960]  because these are the people that are actually trying to change the system
[48:29.960 --> 48:31.960]  and have concrete plans for how to do so.
[48:31.960 --> 48:34.960]  It's one thing to go vote every election cycle.
[48:34.960 --> 48:38.960]  It's one thing to canvassity or something like that,
[48:38.960 --> 48:40.960]  but if you actually want to affect change,
[48:40.960 --> 48:42.960]  you need to change the material conditions.
[48:42.960 --> 48:44.960]  So join an organization, a communist organization,
[48:44.960 --> 48:48.960]  or anarchist organization, and yeah, that's what I would recommend.
[48:48.960 --> 48:52.960]  The communists have the plans.
[48:52.960 --> 48:57.960]  They know how to make it all work.
[48:57.960 --> 49:00.960]  I'm living in a twilight zone right now.
[49:00.960 --> 49:04.960]  Here's just one of the many videos of white people being beaten to death
[49:04.960 --> 49:08.960]  or near death for just being white.
[49:08.960 --> 49:10.960]  Here is the clip from Dallas.
[49:10.960 --> 49:39.960]  That man is now in a coma in Dallas, but he's white. He deserves it.
[49:39.960 --> 49:42.960]  Okay, let's move on.
[49:42.960 --> 49:45.960]  SpaceX was supposed to launch Wednesday,
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.960]  didn't because of tornadoes,
[49:47.960 --> 49:51.960]  and I was here in Austin, I can tell you they were real major storms.
[49:51.960 --> 49:55.960]  And so they launched the first time in over a decade,
[49:55.960 --> 49:57.960]  the U.S. has had its own major booster.
[49:57.960 --> 50:00.960]  It's the heaviest launch booster in the world,
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.960]  bigger and better than the Russians, bigger than a Saturn 9.
[50:04.960 --> 50:06.960]  It's a major accomplishment.
[50:06.960 --> 50:09.960]  So I'm very proud of this, but it got totally overshadowed.
[50:09.960 --> 50:16.960]  So Elon Musk has gone from quasi-con artist zone to Mac Daddy.
[50:16.960 --> 50:18.960]  Here's the launch.
[50:18.960 --> 50:28.960]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
[50:28.960 --> 50:30.960]  Ignition, lift off.
[50:30.960 --> 50:34.960]  As the Falcon 9 accrues Dragon, go NASA, go SpaceX.
[50:34.960 --> 50:36.960]  Nobody had a heavy lifter would do that.
[50:36.960 --> 50:39.960]  That's the heaviest rocket in the world right now.
[50:39.960 --> 50:42.960]  Heaviest lifter there is. Look at that.
[50:42.960 --> 50:49.960]  There rises a new era of American spaceflight and wishes the ambitions of a new generation continuing the dream.
[50:49.960 --> 50:52.960]  20 seconds into flight, stage 1 propulsion is nominal.
[50:52.960 --> 50:55.960]  And again, folks, they called us, oh, human spaceflight was over.
[50:55.960 --> 50:57.960]  Oh, it's all drones, it's all computers.
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.960]  Now this is revolutionary.
[50:59.960 --> 51:02.960]  Plus 30 seconds into this historic mission.
[51:02.960 --> 51:08.960]  Flying crew on board Dragon at Falcon 9, and look at them go.
[51:08.960 --> 51:12.960]  Falcon power, telemetry nominal.
[51:12.960 --> 51:14.960]  M1B, throttle down.
[51:14.960 --> 51:20.960]  We're throttling down to get ready for the period of maximum dynamic pressure.
[51:20.960 --> 51:25.960]  We're in the throttle bucket.
[51:25.960 --> 51:31.960]  Reports say all systems are go.
[51:31.960 --> 51:34.960]  Vehicle is supersonic.
[51:34.960 --> 51:40.960]  We've exceeded Mach 1 on the Falcon 9.
[51:40.960 --> 51:44.960]  M1D, throttle up.
[51:44.960 --> 51:48.960]  We're throttling back up to full power as we're through Max-Q.
[51:48.960 --> 51:52.960]  Copy, 1 throttle.
[51:52.960 --> 51:54.960]  Thing up is going to be the triple.
[51:54.960 --> 52:00.960]  We'll have main engine cutoff of the 9 first stage engines, stage separation,
[52:00.960 --> 52:10.960]  and then ignition of the second stage engine to continue to carry astronauts into orbit.
[52:10.960 --> 52:16.960]  Things looking good, though, getting good callouts, nominal propulsion on that second stage.
[52:16.960 --> 52:21.960]  Bob and Doug continuing to make their way into orbit.
[52:21.960 --> 52:29.960]  Meanwhile, we're supposed to all kill each other here back on Earth.
[52:29.960 --> 52:31.960]  What can Soros do?
[52:31.960 --> 52:35.960]  He can get bricks delivered, hoping black people throw them.
[52:35.960 --> 52:42.960]  Because if you read the document that's on m4s.com, Obama planned martial law 2015, Maryland.
[52:42.960 --> 52:50.960]  It's literally written like, get the blacks to blow stuff up.
[52:50.960 --> 52:52.960]  Really?
[52:52.960 --> 52:53.960]  Like that does something?
[52:53.960 --> 52:56.960]  Like get the blacks to burn stuff down?
[52:56.960 --> 52:59.960]  Because then you get control.
[52:59.960 --> 53:06.960]  So here's a clip of, again, folks waking up in Dallas to wire.
[53:06.960 --> 53:08.960]  They're like pallets of bricks being delivered.
[53:08.960 --> 53:09.960]  Here it is.
[53:09.960 --> 53:10.960]  This right here?
[53:10.960 --> 53:11.960]  Yeah, they put them there.
[53:11.960 --> 53:12.960]  This is the setup.
[53:12.960 --> 53:13.960]  They put them there on purpose, bro.
[53:13.960 --> 53:14.960]  Y'all know where we at?
[53:14.960 --> 53:16.960]  They're going to set them up right up on the rail.
[53:16.960 --> 53:17.960]  Y'all know what building this is right here.
[53:17.960 --> 53:19.960]  I ain't even going to say what name it is.
[53:19.960 --> 53:20.960]  Hey, where do them bricks go to?
[53:20.960 --> 53:21.960]  This is the setup.
[53:21.960 --> 53:22.960]  Where do them bricks go to?
[53:22.960 --> 53:23.960]  We got to do better.
[53:23.960 --> 53:24.960]  Ain't no damn construction.
[53:24.960 --> 53:25.960]  We got to do better.
[53:25.960 --> 53:27.960]  Ain't no damn construction around here.
[53:27.960 --> 53:28.960]  I see.
[53:28.960 --> 53:29.960]  Ain't no damn construction around here.
[53:29.960 --> 53:31.960]  You're just going to set up pallet of bricks right there.
[53:31.960 --> 53:34.960]  Listen, I did jewelry duty three months ago.
[53:34.960 --> 53:36.960]  Y'all don't keep no bricks right there.
[53:36.960 --> 53:38.960]  Do better.
[53:38.960 --> 53:41.960]  Let's look at clip 17 now.
[53:41.960 --> 53:43.960]  As we end the first hour of the transmission.
[53:43.960 --> 53:44.960]  Wow.
[53:44.960 --> 53:45.960]  What an hour today.
[53:45.960 --> 53:47.960]  I played more clips than I ever played.
[53:47.960 --> 53:52.960]  What's the clip 17?
[53:52.960 --> 53:54.960]  Protest outside the White House.
[53:54.960 --> 53:56.960]  The media totally promoted this.
[53:56.960 --> 54:00.960]  Like overrun the White House, kill everybody.
[54:00.960 --> 54:04.960]  And then now didn't go the way they wanted.
[54:04.960 --> 54:19.960]  Here's that clip.
[54:19.960 --> 54:21.960]  Look at these dumbasses.
[54:21.960 --> 54:46.960]  They think they're getting America ahead of things doing this.
[54:46.960 --> 54:52.960]  So again, the general public has taught that the average police are their enemy.
[54:52.960 --> 54:54.960]  How is this political change?
[54:54.960 --> 54:55.960]  It isn't.
[54:55.960 --> 55:02.960]  When you attack the police, it makes government fund the police more.
[55:02.960 --> 55:07.960]  Which then creates more of a governmental control force.
[55:07.960 --> 55:09.960]  I mean that's the reality.
[55:09.960 --> 55:14.960]  But these people think that it's tough to go throw bottles at police
[55:14.960 --> 55:20.960]  who are ordered to be at their post at a certain place and have bottles thrown up.
[55:20.960 --> 55:23.960]  He tried to tell the average, love this, hey, you're being manipulated.
[55:23.960 --> 55:24.960]  It's a larger plan.
[55:24.960 --> 55:27.960]  They look at you and go, oh, shut up, racist.
[55:27.960 --> 55:30.960]  All they work for George Soros is truly sickening.
[55:30.960 --> 55:33.960]  All right, we're going to go to break and come back and start the next hour.
[55:33.960 --> 55:35.960]  We got Millie Weaver coming on.
[55:35.960 --> 55:36.960]  We're going to probably open the phones up.
[55:36.960 --> 55:38.960]  We're going to cover it all.
[55:38.960 --> 55:41.960]  People ask, how is info war still on the air?
[55:41.960 --> 55:42.960]  How are we still here?
[55:42.960 --> 55:44.960]  How are we still fighting?
[55:44.960 --> 55:45.960]  It's you.
[55:45.960 --> 55:47.960]  It's the only way we're on air.
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.960]  So I've been busy the last few weeks with what we're doing on air and what's happening.
[55:52.960 --> 55:55.960]  And we had a couple of big sales, and those have ended.
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.960]  So I just said, let's end it with a bang.
[55:59.960 --> 56:02.960]  We have a 60% off across the board flash sale.
[56:02.960 --> 56:09.960]  Inforceware.com, our biggest sell of the year so far was 60% off our top products.
[56:09.960 --> 56:15.960]  We're dropping prices on our top sellers lower than they've been the entire year.
[56:15.960 --> 56:20.960]  It's time to take advantage of the prep yourself with huge markdown sales.
[56:20.960 --> 56:22.960]  This is our biggest sell 2020.
[56:22.960 --> 56:24.960]  And many products are selling out fast.
[56:24.960 --> 56:26.960]  60% off top sellers.

[57:01.960 --> 57:05.960]  Inforce life, vitamin mineral fusion.
[57:05.960 --> 57:08.960]  All there plus other great deals.
[57:08.960 --> 57:11.960]  But I'll just tell you right now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm exhausted.
[57:11.960 --> 57:13.960]  And I've been in this fight so long.
[57:13.960 --> 57:22.960]  And I can see victory right now because the president has declared Antifa as a terrorist organization.
[57:22.960 --> 57:24.960]  And I'm so mad at myself.
[57:24.960 --> 57:27.960]  I should have started the whole broadcast off with that.
[57:27.960 --> 57:30.960]  But I will start the broadcast off with that right now.
[57:30.960 --> 57:33.960]  And then go to Millie Weaver straight ahead.
[57:33.960 --> 57:40.960]  Right back on this live Sunday, May 31, 2020, global transmission.
[57:40.960 --> 57:41.960]  Stay with us.
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.960]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[57:55.960 --> 58:01.960]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[58:01.960 --> 58:07.960]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse for the first world.
[58:07.960 --> 58:11.960]  And that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks.
[58:11.960 --> 58:14.960]  But I'm going to have medical ID cards, force inoculations.
[58:14.960 --> 58:18.960]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[58:18.960 --> 58:25.960]  But a lot of people are waking up and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny.
[58:25.960 --> 58:30.960]  And we must all rediscover our bill of rights, rediscover our constitution and our backbone
[58:30.960 --> 58:34.960]  and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say,
[58:34.960 --> 58:37.960]  shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[58:37.960 --> 58:42.960]  No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[58:42.960 --> 58:45.960]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling,
[58:45.960 --> 58:47.960]  you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[58:47.960 --> 58:49.960]  Congratulations.
[58:49.960 --> 58:51.960]  Now it's official.
[58:51.960 --> 58:56.960]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years.
[58:56.960 --> 59:01.960]  And the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested
[59:01.960 --> 59:08.960]  because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit.
[59:08.960 --> 59:12.960]  And if you go outside that list of 10, you'll be permanently detained.
[59:12.960 --> 59:17.960]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail,
[59:17.960 --> 59:24.960]  the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[59:24.960 --> 59:29.960]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[59:29.960 --> 59:36.960]  They have to put this electronic straight jacket on us before they carry out their end game, which is global depopulation.
[59:36.960 --> 59:40.960]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[59:40.960 --> 59:44.960]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts,
[59:44.960 --> 59:47.960]  and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[59:47.960 --> 59:49.960]  Wake up or die.
[59:49.960 --> 59:55.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:12.960]  President Trump came out, and I'll cover it next segment, and said,
[1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:19.960]  we're going to count the anti-ethel folks as terrorists because they work in concert.
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:22.960]  They want to overthrow the country and the people. They're not for free speech.
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:27.960]  They're not for due process. They're not for democratic process. They're criminals.
[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:30.960]  We have tonight's the night comrades.
[1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:35.960]  I saw them today in Austin wearing Mao Zedong Chinese communist outfits.
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  Tonight we say F the city.
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:44.960]  We move into the residential areas, the White Hoods, the KKK.
[1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:48.960]  And we take what's ours.
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:53.960]  Twitter allows that to operate.
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:56.960]  But no one else has free speech, including the president.
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:10.960]  Wow. Communist openly pushing race war on Twitter, and Jack Dorsey so arrogant, he thinks he's about to win.
[1:01:10.960 --> 1:01:16.960]  I'm going to cover this next segment. I'm just totally stunned by all this.
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:22.960]  Because America's got its problems, but when it comes to taking care of people of any color, we're the best there is.
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:32.960]  And just to watch these dirty globalists get away with all this and now do this makes my head spin.
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:35.960]  Now, yesterday morning, I had some fun.
[1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:40.960]  My daughter wanted to go buy some toys at Target. She likes Target. She likes the toy section.
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:43.960]  I don't go to Target for other stuff, but I go there for that maybe a couple of times a year.
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:48.960]  So I called Drew up one of her camera guys and I said, okay, I've not been in a store yet.
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:53.960]  I'm wearing a mask in three months. But I said, I'm finally going to a store.
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  And so I'm going to wear this mask.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:59.960]  I'll make a joke out of it to show how it's a cult, how they make you submit.
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:02.960]  So he came and he covered it.
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.960]  So here's that report.
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:06.960]  And we're going to post it to Twitter. We're going to post it to YouTube.
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:10.960]  We're going to post it wherever they don't try to block us. But here it is.
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:13.960]  It's time to be a hero.
[1:02:13.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  I'm going to wear the most advanced anti-COVID mask available on the market.
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:21.960]  The Gore 9000.
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:25.960]  Music playing
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  Music playing
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:31.960]  Music playing

[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:08.960]  me safe, but my baby as well.
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.960]  ok
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:21.920]  come on!
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:48.720]  The humans are not communicating with me.
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:50.240]  Bill Gates will now block out the sun.
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:53.240]  And I will build this rocket in a skinkier planet.
[1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:57.240]  I've conquered a lot of planets, this is pretty easy to conquer.
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:03:59.240]  Thank you.
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:01.240]  We do our thing.
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.240]  Oh, Eric?
[1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:05.240]  I don't know what you say.
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:34.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, no wars were harmed in the filming of this.
[1:04:34.240 --> 1:04:36.240]  Oh, my God.
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.240]  I am literally living in the twilight zone right now.
[1:04:39.240 --> 1:04:41.240]  Everything is hallucination.
[1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:50.240]  All right, we're going to continue to look at the globalist attempt to overthrow the country and replace it with some nightmare globalist operation on the other side.
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:52.240]  And we have Millie Weaver, don't we?
[1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:54.240]  She's coming up.
[1:04:54.240 --> 1:05:20.240]  Thank God.
[1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:46.240]  Thank you.
[1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:54.240]  Again, thank you all for watching. We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[1:05:54.240 --> 1:06:15.240]  Again, thank you all for your support. We are all in this together.
[1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:21.240]  All right, so we sent the crew yesterday to downtown Austin.
[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:24.240]  And the left goes, oh, look, they've got a tank.
[1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:26.240]  We're going to destroy it.
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:27.240]  And they attack it.
[1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:29.240]  They go, look, we destroyed your tank.
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:31.240]  Well, A, you did destroy our tank.
[1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:36.240]  And B, we know you're a violent communist funded by the Chinese globalist.
[1:06:36.240 --> 1:06:47.240]  And you were going to do this. That's why we got an armored vehicle so that in this election year, we could go show what you're up to and what you're doing.
[1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:53.240]  So let's go ahead and go to this video for TV viewers and radio listeners all break it down.
[1:06:53.240 --> 1:07:03.240]  But here he is, the armored vehicle blocks away from the protests around the police department and a bunch of white methods.
[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  There's bad black guys, too. But I'm just going to be honest, a group of white social justice warriors show up out of their mother's basements to attack.
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:16.240]  Here it is.
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:18.240]  And then for radio listeners, it shows up.
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:21.240]  Oh, it's like, let's come together. Let's have freedom.
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:27.240]  They're like, ah, die.
[1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:30.240]  No.
[1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:33.240]  No, we're not Americans. Don't I'm trying to tell him.
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.240]  Why are you attacking this vehicle?
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:39.240]  Look out. Look out.
[1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.240]  Look out.
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:44.240]  Look out.
[1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:46.240]  Look out.
[1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:48.240]  Look out.
[1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:50.240]  Look out.
[1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:53.240]  What do you think you're doing out here?
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:58.240]  Why are you attacking innocent people?
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:08.240]  Why are you attacking innocent people?
[1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:11.240]  Yeah, it's just so much believing we have to turn it down.
[1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:19.240]  So it's a bunch of weird white dudes screaming FU Nazis attacking the American flag.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:23.240]  So John Bowne put out a report on this that breaks it all down.
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:27.240]  We're going to air that report right now. Here it is.
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:33.240]  40 plus cities face an army of mainly leftist crybaby millennials that have descended on America.
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:40.240]  Rather than respect the First Amendment that states Congress shall make no law respecting the right of the people peaceably to assemble
[1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:44.240]  and to petition the government for a redress of grievances,
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:53.240]  that cherished freedom doesn't include setting up piles of bricks for the protesters to hurl at will, as we saw in Dallas, Texas.
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:09:12.240]  This mob of the unemployed due to the pandemic are destroying the very hand that feeds them as they torch our stagnating economy,
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:22.240]  reducing small business owners' lives into ashes just as we were on the precipice of beginning to climb out of this economic hole.
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:28.240]  Egged on and coordinated by social media forces deeply rooted in the George Soros leftist machine,
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:37.240]  looters and rioters disguised as protesters utilized the George Floyd murder to destroy more lives and ultimately themselves
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:44.240]  as facial recognition software is going to be their worst nightmare if it wasn't everyone else's already.
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:55.240]  In many places it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchic and left extremist groups,
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:10:05.240]  far left extremist groups, using antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from outside the state to promote the violence.
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:17.240]  In that regard, it is a federal crime to cross state lines, to use interstate facilities to incite or participate in violent rioting,
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:19.240]  and we will enforce those laws.
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:28.240]  They have completely lost their fear of God. These kids are in front of burning buildings, these kids are looting, taking selfies.
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  That is what just pierces me, is that you're watching these kids go out here and create this violence, taking selfies and going on Instagram live,
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:41.240]  and this has become kind of a cultural fad now.
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:50.240]  I think of the Black Liberation Army, the Black Panther Party, the FALN, the Weather Underground, these were domestic terror groups back in the 60s, 70s and 80s.
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.240]  They didn't have the communications networks that these kids have today.
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:11:02.240]  They didn't have the ability to move the way they do today. They didn't have cell phones and social media.
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:10.240]  So it's easy for these groups today to get a message out and be somewhere within an hour.
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:16.240]  In Austin, Texas, a streamer made it obvious that they weren't from Texas, and neither were the majority of protesters.
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:19.240]  Austin City Hall. That's only half a mile.
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.240]  Oh really?
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:25.240]  Oh, so we're good.
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:27.240]  Oh, that's an Info Wars truck.
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:29.240]  Yes, it is.
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  When the roughly thousand finally arrived at the Texas State Capitol,
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:51.240]  they panicked and concluded that they were going to be locked in the Capitol grounds.
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  Oh, they're planning. They're planning. That's what they like to let us do.
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:15.240]  They like to let us settle and then they plan to shove us out.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  We're going to take the stream and then we're going to get trapped.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:20.240]  You guys are going to get trapped under the tree.
[1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:25.240]  There's some reason I don't know what they're thinking, but they think they're going to trap us in here.
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:29.240]  That's one thousand people with a four foot gate.
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:33.240]  Well, they'll start arresting people one by one, maybe.
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:36.240]  They're afraid they're going to trap us in here, I guess.
[1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:40.240]  Yeah, because we're surrounded by gates and they could just close everything off and then we can't go anywhere.
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:45.240]  Real Texans know that you can't be locked down on the Capitol grounds.
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:47.240]  John Bown reporting.
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:54.240]  You know, that's what's sad about this is these people are so pathetic.
[1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:57.240]  The Capitol grounds are completely open. No one was there.
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.240]  There are a bunch of cowardly methods.
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:02.240]  I'm actually ashamed of white people right now because I'm not.
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:05.240]  They say this is Black Lives Matter and all this.
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:11.240]  It's not. It's a bunch of white methods who live in their basements, who believe MSNBC and CNN,
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:18.240]  who believe that they are marching out for this holy war to take everything over.
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  And they'll attack you if you're a Trump supporter.
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:26.240]  They'll attack you if you're a Republican. They'll attack you if you're a police officer for no reason.
[1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  They don't even know who you are.
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:34.240]  And then they hear somebody turn a siren on, on a bullhorn,
[1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  and you watch that the full footage is a Band-Aid video because our crew shot it.
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:40.240]  It was like 30 minutes of it and they all run.
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:44.240]  Like 3,000 people just, oh, oh, God, we're locked in.
[1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:45.240]  We're going to run.
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:50.240]  Meanwhile, we went right in there ourselves and let them attack us.
[1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:54.240]  Because we're showing you who these people are. They're followers.
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:56.240]  They're not leaders.
[1:13:56.240 --> 1:14:01.240]  And I'm not a virtue segment, man.
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:04.240]  If black people do something as a group wrong, I'll come after their ass.
[1:14:04.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  This is a bunch of methad white people.
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:16.240]  And so Black Lives Matter is not a bunch of weirdo, methad white people that are scared of their own shadow,
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:20.240]  but as a group will beat up our vehicle with hammers and stuff.
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:23.240]  And obviously we cut a guy out of the truck and beat the hell out of those people.
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:25.240]  Forgive me a break.
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:32.240]  But the point is we were doing it to illustrate these are antifree speech dirtbag monsters.
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:38.240]  Like there's one black person in the shot and she's trying to stop people.
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:40.240]  And this is a virtue signal.
[1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.240]  The point is these people do not represent black people.
[1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:45.240]  And let's get that straight.
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:50.240]  It's a bunch of dudes out of their mommy's basements and mommy's a liberal
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:56.240]  and she'll put money in his account if she sees junior out there attacking somebody.
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:14:59.240]  All right. Well, here's the problem.
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:02.240]  You guys started this.
[1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:06.240]  And you're backed by a major farm power.
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:08.240]  So you're going to hurt. You're going to get hurt now.
[1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:13.240]  I mean, there's no other way to tell you and I'm not even proud about it,
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:19.240]  but we'll make sure that I mean, I'm going to get out of the way.
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:20.240]  Let me tell you something.
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:25.240]  You started this fight and when your asses are getting shipped off to super max prisons
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:28.240]  and getting your asses, I mean, you asked for this man.
[1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:31.240]  You really started a fight with the wrong people.
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:32.240]  So it's not with me.
[1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:33.240]  It's not some big power trap.
[1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:38.240]  I'm actually scared of American power because once America is under attack
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:43.240]  and once we're unleashed, there is not anywhere you people can hide.
[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:48.240]  And finally, folks have figured out that there's no safe way to play games with you guys.
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:51.240]  So you want to fight?
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:16:16.240]  You got one. Hope you're ready for it, dumbasses. Hope you're ready for it.
[1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:24.240]  We're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:27.240]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world,
[1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:32.240]  not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations,
[1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:35.240]  the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group and other clubs.
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:40.240]  We're pushing for a pro human future where we build a planet and beyond
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:43.240]  based on humans, poor humans, by humans.
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:46.240]  Not a world where the establishment hate themselves,
[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:50.240]  protect their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post human world.
[1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:53.240]  I'm really excited to know that InfoWars has your support
[1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:57.240]  and I want to thank you all for being pro human and pro God.
[1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:04.240]  We're living in insanely dangerous times and I've told folks going back three months ago,
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:08.240]  I'm not buying horrible food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:11.240]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse
[1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.240]  and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages
[1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:18.240]  and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.240]  and it's even worse in the third world.
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:23.240]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it
[1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:28.240]  but with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing
[1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.240]  and everything else is going on, now is the time to get storeable foods
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:33.240]  because they'll last for 25 years.
[1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:35.240]  They're in easily totable bags.
[1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:39.240]  It's high quality food and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:40.240]  and it funds the InfoWars.
[1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.240]  So we have storeable food available again.
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:46.240]  InfoWarsTour.com or call toll free, triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:17:46.240 --> 1:17:50.240]  Whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:52.240]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:18:17.240]  Get your storeable food at InfoWarsTour.com right now while you still can.
[1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:42.240]  We're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying,
[1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.240]  we may not take orders in a few months.
[1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:46.240]  I may not ever be able to get products again.
[1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:48.240]  Things are collapsing so bad, folks.
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.240]  This is total depression.
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:52.240]  The infrastructure is going down.
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:58.240]  Get the products while you still can.
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.240]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song
[1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:05.240]  and telling you all these horrible things.
[1:19:05.240 --> 1:19:09.240]  But you notice almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:13.240]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[1:19:13.240 --> 1:19:16.240]  It's like telling somebody if you got a pool, put a fence around it.
[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:20.240]  If you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:21.240]  People don't listen.
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.240]  They go out and their kids dead in the pool.
[1:19:23.240 --> 1:19:27.240]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:31.240]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists.
[1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:34.240]  And they admit they've orchestrated it.
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.240]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth.
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:38.240]  And they're teaching us to be more frugal.
[1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:44.240]  And they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:49.240]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public
[1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:51.240]  because it's their operations manual.
[1:19:51.240 --> 1:19:53.240]  I wish this wasn't the case.
[1:19:53.240 --> 1:20:20.240]  But there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:25.240]  The years 2020, the planet is Earth.
[1:20:25.240 --> 1:20:29.240]  And amazing things are happening every day in front of everybody.
[1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:34.240]  Well, here's the headline President Trump tweets.
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:47.240]  The United States of America will be designating Antifa as a terrorist organization.
[1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:53.240]  But they are a foreign power of George Soros and the Chikops.
[1:20:53.240 --> 1:20:57.240]  And they are trying to terrorize the nation.
[1:20:57.240 --> 1:20:58.240]  Wow.
[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:02.240]  What a time to be alive right now.
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:05.240]  We're getting Millie Weaver on the line as soon as we've got her.
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:06.240]  Let me know.
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.240]  We'll go right to her.
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:10.240]  But look at this headline.
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:18.240]  Trump tweets Antifa to be labeled as terrorist organization as rioting, looting and arson attacks grow.
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  AmericanMilitaryNews.com.
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.240]  And I've got AP Reuters.
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:38.240]  I've got them all with the same headlines as President Trump declares it a terrorist organization.
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:41.240]  How big is that because here's the thing.
[1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:53.240]  People say to me when I was out there bullhorning Antifa today, almost every person that knew who I was, every third or fourth person would say, you were against the police state.
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:59.240]  That doesn't mean the police and the ignorance of these people is amazing.
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:07.240]  A police state is where there's no rule of law and we're under martial law and new processes thrown out.
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:09.240]  There's nothing to do with a cop.
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:15.240]  The police are like tires meeting the road.
[1:22:15.240 --> 1:22:20.240]  It's where policy meets reality.
[1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:31.240]  And so if the globalists are trying to train cops to take guns and break up families and forcibly take your seven year old for a sex change.
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:40.240]  I'm not personally mad at that police officer coming to do that, but I'm going to fight them.
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:45.240]  It's where the rubber meets the road.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:52.240]  And that's why the left want to bully the police, sue the police, attack the police.
[1:22:52.240 --> 1:22:55.240]  Just like they attack free speech.
[1:22:55.240 --> 1:23:11.240]  Just like they attack him for worse and sue us 50 plus times and attack us because they're mad about that power of speech and the power of communication and the power of enforcement that you have a county.
[1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:12.240]  You have a city.
[1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:13.240]  You have a state.
[1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:18.240]  You elect people and your crazy neighbor's drunk attacks your house.
[1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:23.240]  You call the cops they come or you've got burglars at your house or you've got a fire.
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:25.240]  You call the fire department.
[1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:28.240]  You paid for that fire department.
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:37.240]  That's your extension of your will, your money, your will made that fire department made that police department.
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:44.240]  And when that extension of your will does not follow your will, you elect a new fire department.
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:46.240]  You elect a new police department.
[1:23:46.240 --> 1:23:50.240]  You elect a new city council.
[1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:57.240]  But when you in general say the cops are Nazis.
[1:23:57.240 --> 1:24:01.240]  When 60 70 years ago, we kicked their asses.
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:09.240]  And George Soros, a Nazi collaborator, like a Nazi is telling me that our police are Nazis.
[1:24:09.240 --> 1:24:20.240]  When the average cop is scared to death about not doing the right thing and being arrested or being sued and they're crippled by it.
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:23.240]  That's the reality.
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:28.240]  And so we sit here in the year 2020.
[1:24:28.240 --> 1:24:34.240]  If you ever had any questions, man, three nights ago, I stayed up all night long.
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:38.240]  And I looked at everything Trump was doing.
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:41.240]  And I wasn't ashamed, but I looked down.
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:46.240]  For about 30 minutes, I had my eyes closed and looked up and I went.
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:51.240]  I couldn't do one 10th the goodest job as a president.
[1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:56.240]  And every time I've second gas to when he's been surrounded, he was right about everything.
[1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:59.240]  And he stood up against all of them.
[1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:16.240]  And then the president took on Google and took on Facebook and took on Twitter and took on the chai comps and declared war on the World Health Organization that did all of the lies.
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:20.240]  And then he went further.
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.240]  If we don't back the president now, because let me tell you, I'm a doubting Thomas.
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:29.240]  If we don't back the president now, we deserve what we get.
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:31.240]  So I literally had a moment on Friday.
[1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:36.240]  I told listeners, I said, this is my gut, my spirit.
[1:25:36.240 --> 1:25:40.240]  Because while we're in this fight, I keep checking the president.
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:41.240]  Is he bright?
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:46.240]  Is he perfect for my position of not being in the middle of where he is?
[1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:57.240]  My gut told me just back to president 100% no matter what now, because if he doesn't get 100% backing spiritually, culturally, economically, metaphysically, we're going to lose.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:26:00.240]  Trump needs full backing right now.
[1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:04.240]  He is a thousand percent what we asked for.
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:06.240]  He is the champion of the Republic.
[1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:08.240]  He has done it.
[1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:13.240]  It's unbelievable that God gave us this person.
[1:26:13.240 --> 1:26:18.240]  You know the patriots in our own government were like, who can challenge a chai kong takeover?
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:20.240]  Who can challenge the trade?
[1:26:20.240 --> 1:26:26.240]  And Trump had his whole life preparing, knowing what he was doing for the position.
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:35.240]  He wasn't even part of the system, but he was metaphysically preparing himself for that position now.
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:38.240]  And so I've been persecuted for supporting the president.
[1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:39.240]  I've been attacked.
[1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:42.240]  And it's only because they know I'm pure.
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:43.240]  I am pure.
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:44.240]  Pure of heart.
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:48.240]  I'm not perfect, but I believe in God and I believe in my mission.
[1:26:48.240 --> 1:26:57.240]  And they were so scared of Alex Jones and Donald Trump, two pure people that believe in power of the people in America and that destiny.
[1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:04.240]  And they did everything they could to punish us and destroy us, to stop us from supporting the president.
[1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:06.240]  But we didn't do it.
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:14.240]  And now in the final equation, the chai comms of the enemy, they're openly waging war, the left's trying to cause race wars.
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:16.240]  They're trying to destroy the economy.
[1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:21.240]  It's so clear because God always gives his people a crystal clear choice.
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:28.240]  Do you want success and freedom and justice and honor and success and pride in yourself?
[1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:34.240]  Or do you want to crap all over it and deny your birthright?
[1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:37.240]  And it is now not in Trump's hands.
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:39.240]  It is not in my hands.
[1:27:39.240 --> 1:27:43.240]  It is in the people's hands.
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.240]  What choice we take?
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:51.240]  Donald John Trump is 100% real.
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:54.240]  100% committed.
[1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:57.240]  You don't just think there is evil in the universe to you.
[1:27:57.240 --> 1:27:58.240]  There's good as well.
[1:27:58.240 --> 1:28:06.240]  So Millie Weaver takes over with all her great story, all the great work she does on the other side.
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:09.240]  And President Trump declaring anti-fraud terrorists.
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:11.240]  Of course they're terrorists.
[1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:13.240]  They don't want free speech.
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:14.240]  They don't want America.
[1:28:14.240 --> 1:28:16.240]  They hate our government.
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:17.240]  They hate our institutions.
[1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:19.240]  They hate our due process.
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:27.240]  They fundamentally are funded by a Nazi collaborator piece of garbage who right now living in...
[1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:33.240]  Connecticut is shaking in fear.
[1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:35.240]  This is everything.
[1:28:35.240 --> 1:28:37.240]  All the lines connecting.
[1:28:37.240 --> 1:28:41.240]  Everything as a crossroads now.
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:45.240]  This is it.
[1:28:45.240 --> 1:28:47.240]  Well, they're right back with Millie Weaver.
[1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:48.240]  Stay with us.
[1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:49.240]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:58.240]  Whatever you did, don't share those live links.
[1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:02.240]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:05.240]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off.
[1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:08.240]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.240]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:12.240]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:14.240]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:16.240]  You are non-essential.
[1:29:16.240 --> 1:29:18.240]  We are shutting your ass down.
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:22.240]  We told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.240]  You're going to be the service economy.
[1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:29.240]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:35.240]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:38.240]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:40.240]  We have to resist and say no to the new world order.
[1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:43.240]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[1:29:43.240 --> 1:29:49.240]  And understanding I was right and getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[1:29:49.240 --> 1:29:51.240]  Now is the time for action.
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:30:20.240]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:29.240]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers,
[1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:33.240]  and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[1:30:33.240 --> 1:30:38.240]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian anti-human group.
[1:30:38.240 --> 1:30:45.240]  They have to put this electronic straightjacket on us before they carry out their end game, which is global depopulation.
[1:30:45.240 --> 1:30:56.240]  So you see submitting to them is death. The only way to stop them is to expose them to hate their guts and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[1:30:56.240 --> 1:31:16.240]  Wake up or die.
[1:31:27.240 --> 1:31:33.240]  It really has made a difference in my life and it can make a difference in your life too.
[1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:35.240]  If you don't get any sleep, you're going to be a grouch.
[1:31:35.240 --> 1:31:37.240]  If you get great sleep, you're going to be on point.
[1:31:37.240 --> 1:31:41.240]  You're going to be mentally focused. You're going to be ready to take on the day.
[1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:45.240]  And right now, knockout is 50% off. It's less than $15 a bottle.
[1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.240]  You get 30 capsules. Give it a try today.
[1:31:47.240 --> 1:31:53.240]  It's at a great price right now and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially in these tough times.
[1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:58.240]  It's knockout and it's available at infowarstore.com.
[1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:25.240]  It's been built up in a complex economy.
[1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:34.240]  That's why we always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:36.240]  They've admitted all of this.
[1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:44.240]  So remember, how does info wars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able to predict things before they happen?
[1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:48.240]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:55.240]  And yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary. But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[1:32:55.240 --> 1:33:20.240]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:31.240]  Welcome back. I'm Alan Schultz, your host on The Sunday Show. And there's not words to describe to listeners and viewers how critical this period is.
[1:33:31.240 --> 1:33:39.240]  There is no joke. There is no debate about what we're facing if humanity doesn't make the right choice.
[1:33:39.240 --> 1:33:52.240]  And you have Antifa, this literal, method, demonic, Soros-funded group that has threatened our own reporters on video with machine guns in Austin two years ago.
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:57.240]  Oh, and Shroyer, nothing happened.
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:03.240]  I mean, if I had some group out with guns threatening protesters, I'd expect to be arrested instantly.
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:06.240]  It's so un-American.
[1:34:06.240 --> 1:34:14.240]  And meanwhile, Antifa has put out on their Twitter. Notice they have a Twitter. I don't have a Twitter, but they have a Twitter.
[1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  Tonight's the night, comrades. Tonight we say F the city and we move into the residential areas, the white hoods, total race-based.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:34.240]  And think about that. And we take what's ours.
[1:34:34.240 --> 1:34:37.240]  That's just out an hour ago.
[1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:46.240]  Iran, North Korea, communist China, they can do whatever they want on Twitter, but you can't.
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:54.240]  Because we're chumps and our government hasn't stood up for us. You know, the average libertarians like, oh, I'm an anarchic capitalist.
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:57.240]  You know, we're going to have the state with her away.
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:08.240]  But the reason we have a state is to stand up to other states. I agree. If we defeated North Korea and communist China and all these other systems, it'd be great to shrink government down.
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:14.240]  I get it. It could be a bureaucratic cut it down. We're not there.
[1:35:14.240 --> 1:35:20.240]  And so you want us to get rid of our government or have it run by these same people.
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:32.240]  So Millie Weaver joins us here. Millie and Millie does a great job reaching tens of millions a week to talk about Trump saying we're declaring anti-post-terrorist everything we asked for.
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:38.240]  He doesn't not just say something and then not do it. And then what's happening going after big tech censorship.
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:44.240]  I mean, Trump has finally, with 155 days out, Millie, taken the gloves off.
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:51.240]  I know that's what your sources, your research say. Millie Weaver, thank you so much for joining us. What are you expecting about to see?
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:36:00.240]  Well, first of all, I think it's great that Trump has finally declared Antifa a terrorist organization. It's been a long time coming.
[1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:10.240]  And second, anyone that's watching these riots and protests right now can obviously tell that what's happening aren't typical riots and protests.
[1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:14.240]  This is something else. And there's much more behind what's going on right now.
[1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:21.240]  Yeah, they're trying to stop our right to protest. They're there to block the bill of rights or like the KKK.
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:30.240]  Yes, but there's more to what's going on. This is more than just protests and riots. This is actually a military insurrection that's going on right now.
[1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:43.240]  This is a classic IIA operation that's being run, Alex. It is an internet interactive activities, psychological operation that's being run on U.S. citizens.
[1:36:43.240 --> 1:36:51.240]  This is technology, the same technology that they used in Ukraine through Wikistrat that they are deploying on U.S. citizens.
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:58.240]  You're right. You hit the key. Trump isn't in control of the government. Deep state elements are launching this right now.
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:11.240]  Oh, absolutely. This is an attack because they know they have used their predictive program software to know that Joe Biden is not going to have a chance to win the 2020 elections.
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:18.240]  That's right. They have prediction software, Alex, where they can use their AI programs to scour the entire internet.
[1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:22.240]  Sure, they agree. Their algorithms show they're losing.
[1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:31.240]  Absolutely. They're using illegally obtained NSA data bridges to collect all private corporations.
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:38.240]  Exactly. The same folks that ran the whole Russiagate hoax. This is their new scam.
[1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:48.240]  Yes. John Brennan, General James Jones, many more. They are running an operation on the American people right now.
[1:37:48.240 --> 1:37:54.240]  And one of the whistleblowers that came forward to me, his name is Patrick Berge. I had him in my video the other day.
[1:37:54.240 --> 1:38:08.240]  He actually was one of the pioneers and creators of these psychological software programs, one of which called ShadowNet, that was deployed in Iraq and Iran on the people there using social media.
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:19.240]  So he is basically... Well, sure, that happened like eight years ago. Obama, Tabernan guys, legalizes propaganda against Americans, foreign...
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:28.240]  Not foreign affairs. It was a foreign... It was a Washington Post publication. But sorry, really, keep going.
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:39.240]  Okay. So basically, what is an IIA operation? Internet, interactive activities, psychological operation. They utilize social media.
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:47.240]  They have an entire dashboard and command and control system through ShadowNet where they can be multiple users all at once.
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:54.240]  They have all these fake accounts, fake identities where they have one person managing and stoking people to go out and violent acts.
[1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:59.240]  Sock puppets, yes. And they can do this, the military grade weapons.
[1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:02.240]  So again, Trump is not in control of the sock puppets.
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:09.240]  No, he is not. This is a deep state operation. And if you really trace it all, who's behind it? Barack Obama. That's who's behind it.
[1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:10.240]  Of course.
[1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:18.240]  The deep state is behind it. They are trying to overthrow President Trump because they've ran their predictive program software and they know that they don't have a chance.
[1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:24.240]  Unless they can create race riots because they have this predictive program software.
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.240]  They are using the NSA databases, all the information that's being collected on the air.
[1:39:28.240 --> 1:39:35.240]  Milly, I totally agree with you. It's confirmed that's what this is. I don't even see this working. What do they do next?
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:41.240]  They're trying to see if they can get a violent overthrow to happen. And how are they doing that?
[1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:45.240]  You really think that these videos are all going viral all at once, coordinated?
[1:39:45.240 --> 1:39:48.240]  Oh, no. All ours get blocked and then theirs get promoted.
[1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:49.240]  Exactly.
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:56.240]  All the footage of the National Guard is being promoted, but footage of them beating up people is not.
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:04.240]  We're seeing old videos from years ago of police brutality being brought up, Alex, and going viral all of a sudden. It's not on accident.
[1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:10.240]  And then these idiots go, oh, you're for the police. What does that even mean? The average cop doesn't want to get arrested or lose their job.
[1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:15.240]  It's not reality-based to say the police are out here trying to kill everybody.
[1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:26.240]  Exactly. They figure if they can get enough violence going on, they'll get enough people to go out and attack other people and maybe right-wing people or Trump supporters to then stoke racial...
[1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:33.240]  Well, that's it. They're trying to trigger our response. So how do we not do that? How do we... I mean, how do we thread the needle?
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:43.240]  Well, as what Trump said earlier, he tweeted that as long as the American people can be awake to what's going on, they can avoid stepping in the traps in the pitfalls.
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:53.240]  And that's what's key. It's hard for us, Alex, like you know, to keep the American people awake to what's going on when we are being censored at every avenue.
[1:40:53.240 --> 1:41:03.240]  And that is why President Trump is finally now doing something about the social media censorship of conservatives by doing this executive order that he just did.
[1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:09.240]  Now, it's not a 100% fix. It's not a magic wand, but it's a step in the right direction.
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:12.240]  It shows the fights on.
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:19.240]  Yes, it shows the fights on. It's going to kick off a lot of other agencies to start digging and doing their due diligence.
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:25.240]  Hey, maybe it will even result in once more of this information comes out, more whistleblowers come out, which I know...
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:33.240]  Well, I'm going to tell the so-called agency something. America's done. It's over if you don't cut through the red tape and stop all this.
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:44.240]  I mean, this is ridiculous. I mean, this is where the chai comms are openly brainwashing people and trying to cause a race war. And we're going to put up with this.
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:53.240]  The problem is, Alex, it's not just the chai comms. It is our own. It is these generals, General Hayden, General Jim Jones.
[1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:55.240]  These were former Obama advisers.
[1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:58.240]  I know Hayden's bad. So you're saying Jones is bad too?
[1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:05.240]  Yes. General Jim Jones, former National Security Advisor to Obama, he is behind a lot of this.
[1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:22.240]  He owns ClearForce and manages ClearForce for the federal government, and they use the technologies, the AI technologies, where they can use the predictive programming to find out who potential future leakers are that work inside the intelligence agencies.
[1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:28.240]  And essentially, off them if they need be. I mean, it's a pretty bad situation that's going on.
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:35.240]  The problem is a lot of Obama appointees and Obama holdovers are still there in positions of power.
[1:42:35.240 --> 1:42:43.240]  No, I mean, I know he was the National Security Joint Chiefs of Staff head for Obama. I would love to identify somebody that's actually running this.
[1:42:43.240 --> 1:42:47.240]  But do you think General, from your sources, General Jones is running this?
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:52.240]  He's part of it. And let me tell you, I know people that used to work for John Brennan.
[1:42:52.240 --> 1:42:54.240]  We'll be right back. Let's talk about this.
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.240]  Millie Weaver.
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:31.240]  It is 50% off. Biodrystallinium, 60% off. Shellforge, it's incredible.
[1:43:31.240 --> 1:43:36.240]  60% off. And you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:45.240]  So infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine to get these items to take advantage of this mega sale memorial day.
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:53.240]  Again, thank you all for watching. We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supported you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:57.240]  Again, thank you all for your support. We are all in this together.
[1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:33.240]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy. It is in cardiac arrest. This has been done by design.
[1:44:33.240 --> 1:44:39.240]  And the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed.
[1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:50.240]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:58.240]  We tried to stop it. We tried to fight it. But you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world, and now you've done it. Congratulations.
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:06.240]  One of our best selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:12.240]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast. And I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:14.240]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:20.240]  In January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went to VA Hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:29.240]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about Living Defense.
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:37.240]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem, and I stumbled with it for about five or six years, and the doctors, they tried every time.
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:42.240]  Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[1:45:42.240 --> 1:45:47.240]  you know what? I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense. Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it.
[1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:55.240]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life.
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:58.240]  Alex Jones and Info Wars saved my life.
[1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:08.240]  We're living in insanely dangerous times, and I told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:14.240]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse, and now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun.
[1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:20.240]  It's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States, and it's even worse in the third world.
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:23.240]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:32.240]  But with the election fraud and the COVID-19, all the wars and the third world collapsing and everything else is going on, now is the time to get storable foods
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:39.240]  because they'll last for 25 years. They're in easily totable bags. It's high quality food, and it's good to have that box checked off to be ready.
[1:46:39.240 --> 1:46:42.240]  And it funds the Info Wars. So we have storable food available again.
[1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.240]  InfoWarsStore.com are called toll-free, triple-A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:50.240]  But whatever you do, get prepared and get ready because the globalists want you dependent on them.
[1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:56.240]  They do not want you to be self-sufficient. Get your storable food at infowarsstore.com right now while you still can.
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:47:03.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:31.240]  All right, look, let's get serious. I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central. David Knight, A.M.
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:35.240]  Kicks it off. Millie Weaver's here. The great work she does.
[1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:43.240]  Millie, we have the president saying we're at war with China. We have the president saying don't invade Taiwan or Hong Kong.
[1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:48.240]  We have the president pulling out of the World Health Organization that ran the whole COVID hoax.
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:55.240]  We have the president admitting that they've been scamming us and running a new world order.
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:48:00.240]  I mean, Trump has totally delivered now. There's no doubt.
[1:48:00.240 --> 1:48:11.240]  But other angles, other points you're making here, Millie, about where this is going, who the players are, what you expect to happen next.
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:19.240]  Well, I expect a lot more whistleblowers to come out because they know that what's happening right now is the make-or-break moment.
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:25.240]  The Deep State is making its move. They're running these military operations on the public right now.
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:34.240]  They're inciting the race riots. They're using the military-grade weapons and software against the American public to create these riots
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:39.240]  and tear down our institutions. This is a war they're trying to overthrow the president.
[1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  It's important to know that when we have these databases, like I said, the NSA Database, they have these data bridges that were illegally created
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:51.240]  and they're running all that information.
[1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:56.240]  Millie explained that. They've got databases at Google, Facebook, Twitter that was set up by the U.S. government.
[1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:00.240]  They're able to run propaganda. This is all admitted, by the way, but the public doesn't know this.
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:07.240]  But it's on the record that they're using social media is still on the hands of globalists, not Trump.
[1:49:07.240 --> 1:49:11.240]  By the way, I wouldn't want it in Trump's hands. It should be the people.
[1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:15.240]  But the point is that Trump is fighting AI Big Tech.
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:23.240]  Exactly. Well, he's fighting AI Big Tech, but he's actually fighting military-contracted private companies
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:30.240]  that these generals that were appointed by Obama are running, as well as the same people who were involved in the Russia collusion hoax
[1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:33.240]  and the witch hunt against President Trump, like John Brennan.
[1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:37.240]  So when you have companies like Dianology who...
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:43.240]  And that's why they're so arrogant. No matter what we do, they just laugh because they're still in control of everything.
[1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:51.240]  My source, Patrick Berge, that created ShadowNet, that runs these IIA operations, the psychological operations on the American people now.
[1:49:51.240 --> 1:50:01.240]  The way they got a hold of this technology is the military contracts out private corporations to create some of its weapons and its AI programs.
[1:50:01.240 --> 1:50:09.240]  It's all got back doors. William Benny's been on record that there's 800,000 private contractors that have more access to the government.
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:14.240]  There's 800,000 contractors that have more access to the president.
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:22.240]  Exactly. They have full access to everything, and they shouldn't, and they don't even have the clearances necessarily to do it.
[1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:26.240]  And what they're doing with the information is our illegal activities.
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:30.240]  It's all just a raw power exercise. So what should Trump do?
[1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:36.240]  They can predict civil unrest and what the outcome will be. They can predict it all with these AI softwares.
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:43.240]  That's why they're still obsessed with timelines and predicting the future with their AI technology. It's creepy.
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:48.240]  Sure. So what should we do? What should Trump do to counter this?
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:56.240]  Trump, I really think that Trump needs to crack down and try to, like, he's doing deploy the National Guard, but he needs to do it in all these other states.
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:00.240]  Oh, listen, they already brought Chinese control. They're already ruling us.
[1:51:00.240 --> 1:51:06.240]  So we're not, he should send the army in to literally grab control of all this AI that we built.
[1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:11.240]  That's default. Take it away because the Chinese are in collusion with the globalist.
[1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:20.240]  So it's a foreign power. So default is literally in five hours, Trump could raid a few dozen people and have control of this and turn it back to the people.
[1:51:20.240 --> 1:51:23.240]  And if he didn't do that, I'd go after Trump.
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:29.240]  Well, he should utilize the fact that now Antifa is a terrorist organization. That's official. They've declared it.
[1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:32.240]  Well, that's the beginning. Yeah, no, they're, they're, yeah.
[1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:37.240]  We're behind it financially. Go after the politicians. Go after the deep state that we're behind this.
[1:51:37.240 --> 1:51:44.240]  If it's their technology that was being used to do all of this, Alex, to run these psyops and use military-grade weapons.
[1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:54.240]  There are people using DARPA technology for globalist functions. If any of them talk to Chinese agents, just like Ted Cruz said, they're now guilty.
[1:51:54.240 --> 1:52:00.240]  It's simple, espionage, Daria. I've told the crew, I've told you, I've told the producer, Daria, I've told, I've told all the guys in there.
[1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:07.240]  I've told you, I've told, I've told Paul Watson, I've told, I've told everybody, I've told the president, I've told everybody.
[1:52:07.240 --> 1:52:16.240]  We're sitting here and we're looking at people, Millie, that are literally working for this multinational corporation.
[1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:19.240]  We've got to stop them. Who else should we try to reach out to?
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:27.240]  Well, you definitely should have Patrick Berge on as a guest. Alex, he can get this information out way better than even I can.
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:33.240]  There are whistleblowers who are inside. They don't want their country to burn. They don't want to see America die.
[1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:42.240]  And they're coming forward with information. He used to work for Dianology and Jones Group International, Alex, and these military-contracted companies.
[1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:49.240]  Now, he can only say so much. He can't give us classified information, but he can point us in the right direction and spell out what's happening.
[1:52:49.240 --> 1:53:00.240]  If we have more people like him and others come forward and we can utilize this evidence against the deep sea, have all these people arrested that are doing this to our country.
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:13.240]  So I agree. So whether it's Steve Watson or Paul Watson or whether it's Darren McGreen or Rob Do or you or the crew, what can the listeners do to expose us?
[1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:21.240]  The best thing the listeners can do is continue to support the president, first of all, because he is being attacked so hard by propaganda and fake news out there.
[1:53:21.240 --> 1:53:24.240]  Oh, there's no doubt that Trump's for real.
[1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:36.240]  Yeah, they need to support and stand by their president. They also need to keep their heads cool. Don't go out there and start getting violent and engaging in the exact thing that the psychological operation wants you to do.
[1:53:36.240 --> 1:53:38.240]  They want you to go out there and get violent. Don't do it.
[1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:41.240]  Oh, obviously, all of this is to get us to be violent.
[1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:49.240]  Of course. And we're not that stupid. We're a lot smarter. I have faith in the conservative people out there, the patriot people out there. They're smart.
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:54.240]  They know that this is a trap. They know that this is an operation being run. They need to support the president.
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:54:03.240]  If you want to go out there and do good, go join the army, go and listen to the military, go become a police officer, get deputized, do it the right way.
[1:54:03.240 --> 1:54:09.240]  Don't go out there and get in like fights in the street because then it's only going to be bad press for everyone.
[1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:14.240]  And the worst thing that we can do right now is go in and continue with these race riots.
[1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:19.240]  You know, we need to close it. I mean, close it, Millie Weaver. What do you expect to come next?
[1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:23.240]  Because it's such an amazing point in human history.
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:31.240]  It's only going to get crazier, Alex. They try to buy a weapon. It wasn't enough. They try to focus impeachment. It wasn't enough.
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:35.240]  I mean, they have hit him with everything. They have hit the American people with everything.
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:42.240]  I mean, is it any coincidence that these rioters, as soon as businesses are about to open up, the economy is about to start booming again.
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:49.240]  As soon as that happens, oh, they all go out and hit all these businesses, break their windows, stop them from opening.
[1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:54.240]  This isn't a hit on the economy as well as to try to further divide the nation.
[1:54:54.240 --> 1:54:59.240]  It's only going to get worse, Alex. People need to buckle up and get ready because it's going to get worse.
[1:54:59.240 --> 1:55:06.240]  And please share information. It's important to be sharing information so that we can get that true information out to the right people, to the American people.
[1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:12.240]  Oh, you're right. It's so precious. Every person listening, however you're listening on local radio stations, TV stations, the Internet,
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:18.240]  we're all meant for this moment right now, and it's so crazy that this is the globalist attack.
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:25.240]  They're actually trying all this, and it's just wild for me, Millie, to know that we're all living in this time.
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:32.240]  It's surreal. I mean, what's been happening is not normal. We all know that. It's not normal. This is an attack on America.
[1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:36.240]  Notice these Antifa, you know, they call themselves, oh, we're anti-fascists.
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:42.240]  We had this tweet trending, hashtag I am Antifa after the president said Antifa was a terrorist organization.
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:49.240]  All these people defending it saying, oh, we're anti-fascists. We don't want fascism. That's what we are. No, you're not.
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  Antifa is not anti-fascists. They're communists that are using a bunch of useless idiots out there to go and help them with their communist revolution.
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:11.240]  They're burning the American flag, the American flag. They're not burning Nazi flags or, you know, they're burning the country's flag that actually stood up to the oppressive fascist regimes,
[1:56:11.240 --> 1:56:18.240]  the most oppressive in the world. America was the one who stopped those fascist regimes.
[1:56:18.240 --> 1:56:29.240]  I love watching the protesters, the videos we just played, wearing masks while they're looting buildings. It's all just the conformist doing whatever they want.
[1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:37.240]  It's totally sick. All right, Millie Weaver, thank you so much. Your videos are at Millenium Millie on YouTube and other places.
[1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:47.240]  Thank you so much. And please join us tomorrow for the weekday show. We'll try to cover all this, but I got to tell you, I'm completely blown away right now.
[1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:57.240]  By how dangerous society is, how crazy it is, and how our own government is caught flat-footed because it's not authoritarian dealing with this.
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:05.240]  So at the end of the day, whatever happens, it's your choice, America. It's your choice. I appreciate the crew. I appreciate the listeners.
[1:57:05.240 --> 1:57:16.240]  I appreciate the radio stations, the TV stations, the folks that pick up our broadcast because I've been doing this 26 years.
[1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:27.240]  I got to tell you, I'm just blown away right now because it's so real, it's so out of control, it's so corrupt, it's so anti-American, it's so stupid to serve this thing.
[1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:34.240]  Thank you all for tuning in tonight. I want to thank the crew and the listeners of all the radio stations, and that's it for this transmission.
[1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:41.240]  Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central. David Knight, before me, I want to swear after me at 3 p.m. Central.
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:46.240]  Thank you so much, and God bless you all.
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:16.240]  Thank you all for tuning in tonight.
[1:58:41.240 --> 1:59:02.240]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles, and when you shoot an elk at, say, 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[1:59:02.240 --> 1:59:13.240]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[1:59:13.240 --> 1:59:19.240]  Then you go back and haul them back in. Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[1:59:19.240 --> 1:59:30.240]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart, and for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:40.240]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers, because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[1:59:40.240 --> 2:00:02.240]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers, and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
