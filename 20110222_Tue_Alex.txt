[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:34.200]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.200 --> 00:39.600]  we're gonna have a power pack transmission for you today it is the 22nd
[00:39.600 --> 00:47.720]  day up February on this Tuesday edition 2011 and obviously oil has shot up by
[00:47.720 --> 00:55.320]  nine percentage points in just the last few hours as the turmoil in the Middle
[00:55.320 --> 00:59.160]  East intensifies and many political analysts in the United States Europe
[00:59.160 --> 01:05.040]  and Russia are saying they believe that the Middle East now faces decades of
[01:05.040 --> 01:12.280]  turmoil in fact the Russian president Medvedev sees quote fires for decades in
[01:12.280 --> 01:18.680]  Arab world and the Muslim Brotherhood is trying to overthrow Qaddafi it appears
[01:18.680 --> 01:21.600]  that it was probably disinformation put out by British intelligence and the
[01:21.600 --> 01:25.320]  Muslim Brotherhood it came out of the British Foreign Office that Muammar
[01:25.320 --> 01:31.720]  Qaddafi had fled yesterday to Venezuela and Hugo Chavez is a little
[01:31.720 --> 01:37.720]  hermitage that he has there there are confirmed reports of helicopters and
[01:37.720 --> 01:43.660]  fighter aircraft bombing and strafing the protesters and regardless of what
[01:43.660 --> 01:47.400]  side you sit on the media is calling them protesters they are people engaged in
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.320]  insurrection to overthrow the government Muammar Qaddafi is a dictator he is a
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.920]  thug he is a socialist he is a funder of terrorists real terrorists back in the
[01:59.920 --> 02:04.600]  day not the stage terrorists that but that does not mean that we're going to
[02:04.600 --> 02:10.000]  get something better there because when the globalist unseen hand is involved in
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  something you better believe there's a larger reason that it's happening so
[02:15.000 --> 02:20.120]  yeah good get rid of housing to buy it get rid of Muammar Qaddafi get rid of
[02:20.120 --> 02:26.800]  the Saudi royal family get rid of all of these hereditary dictatorships or these
[02:26.800 --> 02:31.800]  dictatorial systems but at the same time we have to look at the larger issue
[02:31.800 --> 02:36.520]  that it's about bringing the world into turmoil in many of these countries what
[02:36.520 --> 02:41.520]  the media calls Muslim extremists are going to be going into power and you
[02:41.520 --> 02:44.880]  have to ask why do the globalists want that they're going to set up their own
[02:44.880 --> 02:50.480]  form of tyranny and that appears to be where it's leaning and most political
[02:50.480 --> 02:53.480]  scientists say that that's going to be the outcome in most of these countries
[02:53.480 --> 02:59.280]  so I don't shed any tears for who's in the mubarak but he's he's gone same
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.040]  military junta that took over 30 plus years ago has now just stepped into his
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.600]  place so he goes away has a convenient stroke kind of like the dictator of
[03:08.600 --> 03:14.760]  Tunisia and more of the same comes in and it's celebrated by Anderson admitted
[03:14.760 --> 03:20.560]  CIA Cooper that this is just absolute heavenly Valhalla and that we should all
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.120]  just be celebrating the incredible freedom of the Middle East with George
[03:24.120 --> 03:29.560]  Soros and his operatives in the State Department all over it and bragging in
[03:29.560 --> 03:33.440]  fact Google is bragging that they're helping run these operations of course
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.200]  Google's NSACIA information warfare system now here's a headline of Reuters
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.360]  Russia blames Google for stirring Egyptian unrest well they sent their
[03:42.360 --> 03:47.200]  people in to do it it's not debated I like that headline yesterday you know the
[03:47.200 --> 03:52.720]  widow of that top level former Bush administration official who was shot
[03:52.720 --> 03:58.120]  dead and then thrown in a trash can and then the headline is she claims a hit
[03:58.120 --> 04:04.200]  man killed him well no I mean he was murdered he was killed I mean the guy
[04:04.200 --> 04:12.200]  shot on the boards of more than 30 I read the list on air a few weeks ago what
[04:12.200 --> 04:15.080]  was his name Wheeler I got to pull it back up the point is he sat on all these
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.600]  giant Fortune 500 boards he was involved in all these different serious
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.800]  operations and he's disheveled running around town without a shoe for a day
[04:23.800 --> 04:30.320]  obviously running for his life under surveillance and well I'm already
[04:30.320 --> 04:35.560]  digressing it's just that's how they spin it it's like Russia says Google's
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.960]  involved Google says they're involved the woman says a hit man killed her
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.200]  husband he was he was hit was professional head was thrown in a dumpster
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.240]  and there's no investigation it just we don't even know if he was killed yeah
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.640]  he was murdered but we don't know if it's a hit man we'll be right back with
[04:52.640 --> 05:00.440]  all this incredible news Lindsay Williams coming up by the way this is
[05:00.440 --> 05:03.800]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:03.800 --> 05:07.760]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[05:07.760 --> 05:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[05:12.040 --> 05:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[05:20.680 --> 05:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[05:29.320 --> 05:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[05:33.440 --> 05:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[05:37.400 --> 05:41.200]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.920]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[05:43.920 --> 05:49.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolar
[05:49.200 --> 05:53.640]  backup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the
[05:53.640 --> 05:59.640]  Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365

[07:07.680 --> 07:11.640]  work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and
[07:11.640 --> 07:14.920]  government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be getting worse
[07:14.920 --> 07:18.560]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long

[08:03.400 --> 08:08.840]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[08:08.840 --> 08:13.480]  Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:14.400 --> 08:20.160]  all right we're going to cover the incredible ongoing developments in the
[08:20.160 --> 08:24.440]  Middle East and North Africa the response in Europe the response of the
[08:24.440 --> 08:30.880]  United States in Russia to it the incredible effects it's happening with
[08:30.880 --> 08:38.720]  one-day oil prices going up by 9% in one day on fears of what's happening in
[08:38.720 --> 08:44.720]  Libya what's happening in Bahrain what's happening in Saudi Arabia Jordan
[08:44.720 --> 08:52.360]  what's happening in several other countries the island nation of Morocco
[08:52.360 --> 09:00.000]  the royal families being shook there by protest we've got Lindsay Williams
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.240]  coming up in the third hour in fact we're going to call him right now I may
[09:03.240 --> 09:06.280]  just get him on in the middle of the next hour so we have an hour and a half
[09:06.280 --> 09:13.680]  with him today and I thought yesterday to call Lindsay because about 95% of what
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.040]  Ken from the former head of operations for Atlantic Richfield the late Ken
[09:18.040 --> 09:21.960]  from we couldn't give out his name for years I knew his name because I figured
[09:21.960 --> 09:26.080]  it out reading the energy non-crisis Mr. Fromm was actually fired for a while
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.720]  because of that book in 1980 and they brought him back the other Mr. Rex in
[09:31.720 --> 09:38.120]  the book well he's not Mr. Rex in the book it's all hidden in plain view was
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.400]  the CEO of one of the big three oil companies separately that Lindsay knows
[09:43.400 --> 09:50.680]  and going back five six years ago even though folks like Dr. Stan Monteef who's
[09:50.680 --> 09:54.440]  on this network been on the radio for over 30 years he still likes to check
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.200]  things out he was able to figure out who they were he called both of them and
[09:57.200 --> 10:01.320]  confirmed that indeed they were telling Williams this and one of them told
[10:01.320 --> 10:07.600]  Monteef you know don't call me again and wouldn't return his calls after that
[10:07.600 --> 10:16.400]  so I know that these men both Mr. Fromm and the other gentleman who we can't
[10:16.400 --> 10:21.520]  say his name are real and I know that Lindsay's been talking to them now it
[10:21.520 --> 10:31.760]  was hidden in plain view back in 2007 it came out from leaks to Jim Tucker and
[10:31.760 --> 10:35.920]  Daniel Estle and others that they were going to plan to drive up oil prices
[10:35.920 --> 10:40.720]  massively that's all we got out of Bilderberg and then later I noticed that
[10:40.720 --> 10:44.640]  when Williams was covering it that that we'd had a prisonplanet.com
[10:44.640 --> 10:48.520]  article from that period a few months before Williams came out with our
[10:48.520 --> 10:52.920]  Bilderberg sleuths that have the connections that have been proven to be
[10:52.920 --> 11:01.200]  just stunning Jim Tucker especially 33 years now plus covering Bilderberg it
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.240]  may be I guess we're under the 34th year in June when they meet again and
[11:04.240 --> 11:10.040]  Tucker let's just say has moles who aren't Bilderberg members but who are
[11:10.040 --> 11:17.400]  their secretaries people like that and I'm just gonna leave it at that when you
[11:17.400 --> 11:23.240]  get sources that high level inside where the real decisions are being made
[11:23.240 --> 11:29.800]  unless they're feeding you disinformation that is unless Ken Fromm and the
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.960]  other gentleman who I can't name we're telling Williams disinformation or
[11:33.960 --> 11:40.560]  telling him things that were his opinion unless those factors are in there
[11:40.560 --> 11:45.400]  you can take it to the bank and I mean here's some of the things that Jim
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.000]  Tucker predicted two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall he said that it
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.480]  would be taken down basically in a quasi-staged event towards
[11:55.480 --> 12:01.400]  perestroika and a taunt people laughed at him it happened six months before
[12:01.400 --> 12:05.720]  George W. Bush announced that he was gonna accept four years ago that global
[12:05.720 --> 12:09.760]  warming was real and was gonna go ahead and go along with carbon taxes Jim
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.920]  Tucker said that that was from inside Bilderberg and then months later Bush
[12:14.920 --> 12:21.000]  did come out and do that I mean there are countless examples Tucker has said
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.040]  Tony Blair is gonna be called a little-known member of British Parliament
[12:26.040 --> 12:30.640]  he's gonna be the Prime Minister coming up in two years boom happened he called
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.560]  Bill Clinton when he was a little-known governor and went to Bilderberg a year
[12:35.560 --> 12:40.360]  before the campaign started Tucker called it Rick Perry went to Bilderberg in
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.680]  2007 that that's how our film in-game ends is with us talking about Rick Perry
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.400]  and I know the inside baseball here in Austin he has got the presidential you
[12:50.400 --> 12:55.560]  know pre-run book out fed up he's even Texas Monthly's reported that they're
[12:55.560 --> 13:00.160]  inside sources here in Austin confirm that Perry's running for president he
[13:00.160 --> 13:04.400]  maybe even with Palin they've been in those discussions with each other but
[13:04.400 --> 13:07.800]  they're deciding who's he goes bigger who's gonna be the VP Perry won't take
[13:07.800 --> 13:15.560]  her as you know he won't be a VP and and Palin saying that she isn't gonna be
[13:15.560 --> 13:21.080]  VP but but they're trying to pair those two up so coming out of nowhere you know
[13:21.080 --> 13:26.080]  Mitt Romney's gonna be big Ron Paul's gonna be big but Rick Perry and we knew
[13:26.080 --> 13:31.600]  that from Bilderberg 2007 they don't invite governors or members of
[13:31.600 --> 13:37.000]  parliament from countries to the events unless they're presidential contenders I
[13:37.000 --> 13:45.360]  cover this in the Obama deception and and I'm covering this to detail how
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.320]  powerful the inside info is from inside groups like Bilderberg or if you're able
[13:50.320 --> 13:53.440]  to talk to former Bilderberg group members or attendees the type of
[13:53.440 --> 14:02.600]  information you can get because there are just again countless examples of the
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.160]  information that we're able to get from there then actually unfolding and
[14:06.160 --> 14:12.520]  happening another example is covered in the Obama deception 2008 we knew
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.680]  Bilderberg group was gonna be meeting in Chantilly Virginia we get on an
[14:17.680 --> 14:27.320]  airplane I go up there two nights before it officially starts I'm following the
[14:27.320 --> 14:35.040]  news the day before it starts it's all over the news that Obama said get on the
[14:35.040 --> 14:38.840]  airplane to the press corps when he was the frontrunner just at that point
[14:38.840 --> 14:46.200]  passing Hillary and that they were gonna be going to Chicago and they put the
[14:46.200 --> 14:54.240]  press corps on the plane slam the door shut there at the airport in DC there at
[14:54.240 --> 14:58.920]  Dallas and took off and there's of course the video the press corps going
[14:58.920 --> 15:03.680]  we've been Shanghai we've been kidnapped and then for a day and a half the media
[15:03.680 --> 15:09.280]  raced all over Virginia and Washington DC and Maryland looking for where Hillary
[15:09.280 --> 15:13.480]  and Obama were meeting they went to different senators houses they went to
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.440]  different hotels and I'm there getting home from the night before Bilderberg
[15:18.440 --> 15:25.120]  starts at my hotel at the Hyatt they were meeting at the Marriott in Chantilly
[15:25.120 --> 15:32.440]  and I'm watching the news sitting there in my bed in my underwear and they're
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.000]  reporting on the missing Obama and Hillary and I actually called Aaron
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.960]  Dykes up in his room and I said a camera at the television set on CNN that's all
[15:41.960 --> 15:47.760]  they're talking about get some of this on video Aaron did one better he went
[15:47.760 --> 15:51.400]  downstairs in the bar with a camera and aimed at the television that's a little
[15:51.400 --> 15:58.840]  clip you see in Obama deception where you see actually a clip of MSNBC while
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.240]  Aaron's in the bar shooting it they're talking about secret meeting where they
[16:02.240 --> 16:07.400]  really meeting and of course the Bilderberg meeting was about to take
[16:07.400 --> 16:14.600]  place we had intel that Obama was going to be there Tucker got that intel so did
[16:14.600 --> 16:21.680]  Esteline and then here comes two different motorcades with Secret Service
[16:21.680 --> 16:30.440]  with their submachine guns up in the windows with the Secret Service license
[16:30.440 --> 16:36.560]  plates going in and so there was Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama meeting
[16:36.560 --> 16:42.440]  and there was this big national top story at the time will Hillary or will
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.840]  Obama bow out for the party because they were basically a dead heat Obama in
[16:47.840 --> 16:52.960]  some polls was a few points ahead will they stop savaging each other what's
[16:52.960 --> 16:55.880]  gonna happen where are they secretly meeting why did they send the press
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.600]  corps to Chicago telling them that Obama will be on the plane and then Gibbs
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.840]  the his press secretary at the time said well there was a desire to meet with
[17:05.840 --> 17:09.480]  some people privately and so that's why we did this and he sat there and
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.560]  giggled and laughed about it to the media but Obama was like gold then you
[17:14.560 --> 17:19.600]  know that the savior and waiting so no one dare dare criticize him but the
[17:19.600 --> 17:27.360]  larger issue here is that you could have the two presidential contenders in a
[17:27.360 --> 17:38.920]  neck-and-neck race go meet secretly off and on at a hotel and CNN ABC CBS
[17:38.920 --> 17:45.440]  they're not stupid they had sources Fox News they knew where Obama and Hillary
[17:45.440 --> 17:53.480]  were we called them we call the scores you're standing out there all day and
[17:53.480 --> 17:56.660]  nights at Bilderberg we call the Washington Post we call the Washington
[17:56.660 --> 18:02.160]  Times we call the New York Times we call local TV stations one newspaper came
[18:02.160 --> 18:08.080]  out there and that was the epoch times and they wrote a story about and that's
[18:08.080 --> 18:10.600]  an international paper basically affiliated with the fall on gong and
[18:10.600 --> 18:16.200]  anti-communist publication but there's an illustration of the power of the
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.280]  Bilderberg group that the mainstream media you've got the biggest story in
[18:20.280 --> 18:25.240]  the country Obama and Hillary have disappeared for a day or more no one
[18:25.240 --> 18:30.400]  knows where they are we're calling the media telling them Obama and Hillary
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.880]  are meeting secretly here that's the biggest story ever in the middle of a
[18:33.880 --> 18:38.600]  campaign wondering who the who is going to get the presidential nomination for
[18:38.600 --> 18:45.160]  the Democratic presidential run and you've got hundreds of protesters and
[18:45.160 --> 18:49.640]  dozens and dozens of alternative media outlets streaming it for days over
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.480]  YouTube we were doing live streaming on Justin TV we were doing live Collins I
[18:54.480 --> 18:58.080]  was the only other program would talk about it was coast to coast AM had me
[18:58.080 --> 19:02.920]  on what two nights in a row to give reportage on it so coast to coast AM
[19:02.920 --> 19:08.000]  epoch times and that's it you want to talk about big mainline medium that's
[19:08.000 --> 19:14.320]  it so it's an illustration of the secret meetings behind closed doors that
[19:14.320 --> 19:17.480]  the decision was made that Hillary would step down and get behind Obama and
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.520]  become secretary of state and that was announced a few days later we were able
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.240]  to predict what was going to happen we also had moles inside and then you have
[19:26.240 --> 19:33.520]  this larger example of media control so I don't believe Lindsey Williams I know
[19:33.520 --> 19:38.800]  Lindsey Williams does talk to these men and his information that he's gotten
[19:38.800 --> 19:43.480]  from them being relayed to us is what they told him and Lindsey says that this
[19:43.480 --> 19:49.120]  is clearly the biggest information that he's ever been given not from Ken
[19:49.120 --> 19:52.640]  Fromm but the confirms what he said before he died in December Lindsey lay
[19:52.640 --> 19:56.360]  all this out in October but from the other guy about what's really happening

[23:54.960 --> 24:11.040]  the original since 1976
[24:11.040 --> 24:15.200]  all right we're gonna break down oil going up more than 9% in just the last
[24:15.200 --> 24:24.240]  five hours since it started trading in New York we are going to get into the
[24:24.240 --> 24:28.120]  latest developments in North Africa in the Middle East and also in the
[24:28.120 --> 24:34.920]  Mediterranean with Morocco in turmoil that is all coming up I stayed up here
[24:34.920 --> 24:39.600]  at the office till late last night and had about a 45 minute discussion with
[24:39.600 --> 24:45.400]  Lindsey Williams and he told me what he's going to talk about on the air and
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.240]  he basically is going to break it down from the beginnings of meeting these
[24:50.240 --> 24:56.560]  men and being the liaison a lot of big corporations do this between three major
[24:56.560 --> 25:03.280]  oil companies and the oil field workers he was basically their legate the old
[25:03.280 --> 25:07.240]  Roman days the emperor couldn't be everywhere and so he would have two or
[25:07.240 --> 25:11.520]  three trusted what they called legates or people that could serve as their
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.380]  spokesman and so that's what he that's why he was allowed into all these
[25:14.380 --> 25:18.360]  meetings and was allowed to see all these secrets and wrote the energy
[25:18.360 --> 25:22.920]  on crisis it's out of print in 1980 and again Ken Fromm got fired over that
[25:22.920 --> 25:28.280]  because he quoted a minute then Fromm got mad and actually gave public
[25:28.280 --> 25:33.800]  speeches in what 1982 Williams will go over all this there's there's actual
[25:33.800 --> 25:36.920]  videos of all this out there so I said this is always hidden in plain view
[25:36.920 --> 25:40.320]  there there's videos and I'm Williams is trying to dig them up and send them to
[25:40.320 --> 25:46.000]  us but I went looked it up as records of these meetings where they actually gave
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.200]  public speeches on all this on the fact that there was more oil in Alaska than
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.720]  in all of Saudi Arabia and that we weren't allowed to have even one tenth
[25:54.720 --> 26:00.960]  of it but then he walked through everything that these men Ken Fromm up
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.000]  into December when he sadly passed and the other gentleman even more high
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.400]  powered that again is in public view it's in Lindsay's book but you got to
[26:08.400 --> 26:11.360]  figure it out for yourself because the guy says this under anonymity so we're
[26:11.360 --> 26:21.160]  not going to break that here but Lindsay said it was always again the keyword
[26:21.160 --> 26:27.680]  term here is hidden in plain view and I remember interviewing Williams 13 14
[26:27.680 --> 26:33.760]  years ago when he was laying out the energy non-crisis information and
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.880]  talking about you know the fact that we have all this oil here which is now a
[26:37.880 --> 26:41.560]  mainstream fact it was hidden for many years but now they admit that they're
[26:41.560 --> 26:46.560]  not tapping even a fraction of what's in Alaska or other areas or even the Gulf
[26:46.560 --> 26:49.600]  of Mexico for that matter
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.120]  I'm trying to be careful about what I say here is it's so complex but also so
[26:55.120 --> 27:04.000]  simple at the same time and Williams is coming up but Williams had an epiphany
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.800]  and so did I that's why I called him yesterday and he wasn't even ready to
[27:10.800 --> 27:14.160]  come on yet because you know he likes to produce a CD where he can break it all
[27:14.160 --> 27:20.680]  down for people that's not been produced yet I just had a feeling to calling and
[27:20.680 --> 27:25.360]  to get him on the show and he wasn't ready until today but if you go back to
[27:25.360 --> 27:32.920]  his book written in 1980 now 31 years ago hard to believe how time flies or if
[27:32.920 --> 27:41.760]  you listen to the interviews I did 14 13 12 10 I mean I've interviewed him
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.560]  several times a year ever since I've been on the radio really I think I even
[27:46.560 --> 27:52.960]  interviewed him like a 96 but the point is that this was always the Henry
[27:52.960 --> 27:58.200]  Kissinger's a big Nebrazinski plan this was the deal made with the Arabs that is
[27:58.200 --> 28:05.840]  a public deal that they would buy with the oil money they got from the US they
[28:05.840 --> 28:11.320]  would put it back in the US with T bills and this deal is actually covered in a
[28:11.320 --> 28:18.880]  fictional account we should try to find this from the movie Network in fact I
[28:18.880 --> 28:22.880]  actually own that DVD I meant to bring it into the office but if you Google
[28:22.880 --> 28:35.160]  guys YouTube Network Howard Beale talks to executive or talks to Mr. it's not
[28:35.160 --> 28:40.040]  Mr. Hackett played by Robert DeVall it's his boss and he calls him in and he
[28:40.040 --> 28:48.920]  says you have meddled with the title forces of nature Mr. Beale and you will
[28:48.920 --> 28:55.000]  atone the Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this country and now they
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.360]  must put it back Mr. Beale they must any breaks down they must be allowed to buy
[29:00.360 --> 29:04.160]  US companies Mr. Beale they must be allowed to buy shares in this network
[29:04.160 --> 29:08.840]  Mr. Beale they must buy US shares Mr. Beale because it's the ebb and flow of
[29:08.840 --> 29:14.120]  international capitalization am I getting through to you Mr. Beale and they
[29:14.120 --> 29:17.240]  actually talk about because that was all in the news at the time a lot of this
[29:17.240 --> 29:22.280]  isn't even secret and so the Arabs have been totally scammed for 30 plus years
[29:22.280 --> 29:25.720]  they've invested almost all their money in the T bills in the dollar and when
[29:25.720 --> 29:29.800]  they bring that down they're gonna bring the Arabs down the globalists are
[29:29.800 --> 29:33.880]  gonna move everything basically to China and when Williams was telling me all
[29:33.880 --> 29:38.760]  this it's already hidden plain view I already knew everything he was telling
[29:38.760 --> 29:43.800]  me but this is from a Bilderberg group level individual confirming it and just
[29:43.800 --> 29:50.520]  wait till we go over it

[32:16.360 --> 32:19.880]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[32:19.880 --> 32:23.560]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[32:23.560 --> 32:27.000]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:30.760 --> 32:33.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose
[32:33.560 --> 32:37.560]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[32:37.560 --> 32:40.360]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind

[32:55.560 --> 33:05.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[33:05.560 --> 33:09.400]  we now take you live to the central texas command center
[33:09.400 --> 33:19.000]  and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:20.040 --> 33:23.080]  okay let me try to sum this up simply and then we'll go into more detail when
[33:23.080 --> 33:28.120]  lynching williams joins us there is a collection of private
[33:28.120 --> 33:31.720]  central banking families who were able to get most european
[33:31.720 --> 33:37.640]  countries england and the united states within the last 200 years or so
[33:37.640 --> 33:43.080]  1815 in england similar time frame in continental europe not till
[33:43.080 --> 33:46.440]  1913 in the united states but they were able to position
[33:46.440 --> 33:49.560]  themselves to control the issuance of currency and credit
[33:49.560 --> 33:54.360]  so they could buy up the world buy up any media buy up governments do anything
[33:54.360 --> 33:58.760]  they can they control the issuance of currency and credit through the
[33:58.760 --> 34:01.880]  governments but they are paid interest on the right
[34:01.880 --> 34:05.240]  for the government to produce money so they control
[34:05.240 --> 34:10.760]  all of the credit now the arabs have their own banking system
[34:10.760 --> 34:17.640]  that is based on upfront fees and has trillions and trillions of dollars in
[34:17.640 --> 34:23.720]  it because usury is illegal under islamic law
[34:23.720 --> 34:26.520]  now that's another big reason the globalists want to overthrow those
[34:26.520 --> 34:30.680]  countries and put in new regimes who will play ball with them
[34:30.680 --> 34:33.960]  and allow the big banks to basically destabilize them
[34:33.960 --> 34:37.800]  break them down through economic and societal turmoil
[34:37.800 --> 34:41.960]  and then come in and finance their reconstruction
[34:41.960 --> 34:45.560]  and there's so many multivariate multifaceted
[34:45.560 --> 34:47.880]  i'm quoting a video clip that's coming up at a moment
[34:47.880 --> 34:52.040]  things that go into this but everything's being converted into a corporate world
[34:52.040 --> 34:55.640]  government in the 1970s they put out rollerball with james
[34:55.640 --> 35:02.360]  kahn all about energy sectors and global unions and 10 unions that form a
[35:02.360 --> 35:05.400]  global union and where there's different sectors and how
[35:05.400 --> 35:08.840]  certain nations are only allowed to produce
[35:08.840 --> 35:13.320]  certain things one country's manufacturing another communication
[35:13.320 --> 35:18.360]  another energy and then the un sits above that with the only
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.880]  military force or the fascist symbol of the hatchet
[35:21.880 --> 35:25.640]  on top of the bundle of sticks you know binding them together
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.640]  and this is what globalism in the new order is this is what they teach
[35:29.640 --> 35:37.480]  at harvard and yale and at the public school of public affairs at ut
[35:37.480 --> 35:41.960]  erin dykes went there has a degree from there and they taught world
[35:41.960 --> 35:47.160]  governments good global corporate control one world currency
[35:47.160 --> 35:50.280]  and so when i hired him it was a perfect fit because
[35:50.280 --> 35:53.960]  he'd been there but but they tried to teach him it was all good
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.080]  and obviously here he knew it was all true because he'd already been taught
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.920]  all that just we have a different perspective
[36:00.920 --> 36:05.320]  we don't want some far-off unelected globalist who happen to be eugenicist
[36:05.320 --> 36:08.840]  who want to set up a planetary regime get us all under debt
[36:08.840 --> 36:12.760]  shut down society have one child policies and basically phase out
[36:12.760 --> 36:18.360]  and call out the population but erin you know when he got here would just laugh
[36:18.360 --> 36:21.560]  at the mainstream media saying there's no world government there's no new world
[36:21.560 --> 36:24.360]  order when all he was taught was that it was good
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.680]  and it was great and you hear these college students calling in especially
[36:28.680 --> 36:31.800]  people going for their masters their phd's
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.720]  same thing with steve watson he's got a uh masters
[36:35.720 --> 36:39.800]  in political science from a university in england
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.400]  what is the one in nottingham the point is he was taught all that
[36:43.400 --> 36:46.920]  so why can he now write articles understand it all because the enemy
[36:46.920 --> 36:50.680]  taught him everything he knows the enemy was there telling steve watson and
[36:50.680 --> 36:53.160]  telling erin dykes that yes we're going to have a global
[36:53.160 --> 36:55.160]  government yes we're going to control everybody
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.560]  but it's for your own good so they have movies like rollerball in the 70s
[36:59.560 --> 37:03.160]  where they rolled it out in a fictional account to pre-program
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.840]  and basically acclimate people they put out movies like
[37:06.840 --> 37:10.200]  network very well done we're going to play a clip here with
[37:10.200 --> 37:14.600]  Ned Beatty who's the big corporation chief
[37:14.600 --> 37:19.160]  and he's calling in the news anchor who went live on air
[37:19.160 --> 37:23.000]  kind of had a breakdown that is he broke into reality
[37:23.000 --> 37:27.240]  and he says look you know we can't allow the Arabs
[37:27.240 --> 37:34.120]  to own this this tv network and so he gets called into the ceo's office
[37:34.120 --> 37:37.960]  not of the network but of the company that owns the network and he says look
[37:37.960 --> 37:41.400]  let me explain to you how this really works
[37:41.400 --> 37:44.920]  okay and and and you haven't just stopped a merger here
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.640]  or or or this company being bought you have caused
[37:49.640 --> 37:53.320]  serious shockwaves throughout the global system and then he tells him the
[37:53.320 --> 37:57.000]  global system will be no war no famine total peace kind of like
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.600]  emperor palpatine saying now that we've killed all the Jedi there will be
[38:00.600 --> 38:04.440]  peace yeah peace meaning scorched earth
[38:04.440 --> 38:10.280]  siege annihilation genocide the oldest form of total war completely wipe your
[38:10.280 --> 38:13.080]  enemy out financially psychologically
[38:13.080 --> 38:16.760]  dumbing everyone down it's full spectrum dominance the globalists are
[38:16.760 --> 38:20.360]  threatened by intellect by private property by anyone of means
[38:20.360 --> 38:24.600]  who isn't part of their system and if you watch
[38:24.600 --> 38:30.520]  rollerball or you watch network both came out the mid-70s
[38:30.520 --> 38:36.840]  it's mercantilism it's in the associated press again today
[38:36.840 --> 38:41.800]  it broke a few weeks ago that china is internally putting pressure because
[38:41.800 --> 38:43.560]  they own over a trillion dollars of quote
[38:43.560 --> 38:49.800]  ust bills us debt debt instruments that they're ordering
[38:49.800 --> 38:56.040]  the treasury to order the sec to allow the chinese to buy up critical
[38:56.040 --> 38:58.680]  infrastructure
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.840]  oil fields toll roads media companies
[39:02.840 --> 39:07.240]  giant positions in in stock markets not the stocks being traded the stock
[39:07.240 --> 39:10.280]  markets themselves the germans the e you
[39:10.280 --> 39:13.720]  driven by the germans are now taking over the new york stock exchange
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.920]  it's all merging right now and they've got this mercantilism where they
[39:18.920 --> 39:23.080]  china keeps their currency low yeah there's the headline
[39:23.080 --> 39:27.160]  uh ap business china state firms to hand
[39:27.160 --> 39:31.080]  over more profits now that's that's not it it's a
[39:31.080 --> 39:37.160]  it's a headline of china let me give you the exact headline china
[39:37.160 --> 39:43.240]  china used us debt holdings to pressure us here i'll just dig it out
[39:43.240 --> 39:46.840]  problem is i put all these articles together there's so many and then oh it
[39:46.840 --> 39:49.480]  doesn't matter it's all over the news everybody knows about it
[39:49.480 --> 39:52.520]  i'm gonna find it here because i don't want to just say something and then i'll
[39:52.520 --> 39:56.840]  have it maybe it's in my global stack
[39:56.840 --> 40:01.080]  uh there it is cable showed china used debt holdings to press us
[40:01.080 --> 40:04.200]  and that's out of afp but it's also an ap good job
[40:04.200 --> 40:08.040]  marley okay so they're documented that for you
[40:08.040 --> 40:11.960]  but it's all about the globalist at the banking level above countries
[40:11.960 --> 40:16.680]  with a balance of power so that nation states can't be strong and independent
[40:16.680 --> 40:19.640]  and then all the power is in the hand of the offshore globalist
[40:19.640 --> 40:23.800]  and so china keeps their currency way low basically devalued
[40:23.800 --> 40:27.720]  so no one can compete with them they have internal tariffs against our goods
[40:27.720 --> 40:30.280]  getting in nafta and gat and these international
[40:30.280 --> 40:33.640]  trade agreements are used with with all these third world countries
[40:33.640 --> 40:38.120]  to leverage the us with labor cost and with environmental regulations we have
[40:38.120 --> 40:41.880]  here and oppressive taxes to where you physically
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.280]  cannot make the products in many cases here in the us
[40:46.280 --> 40:49.880]  and mexico is losing its jobs now to china and so is india
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.640]  no one can compete with it because they've got giant slave factories
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.840]  where they've got to put big nets around their five and ten story buildings
[40:58.840 --> 41:02.600]  because people are committing suicide by the score every day
[41:02.600 --> 41:06.520]  they're now drugging the workers uh so that they'll submit
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.040]  japan's looking at drugging their workers with lithium the u.s government
[41:10.040 --> 41:13.960]  was in the news two days ago calling for it i mean they're bringing in a system
[41:13.960 --> 41:17.400]  so dehumanizing that they're openly saying we're going to drug you
[41:17.400 --> 41:20.840]  and put suicide nets up that's the model china
[41:20.840 --> 41:23.640]  already doing it
[41:27.400 --> 41:33.240]  so it's mercantilism and i go back to this 300 plus
[41:33.240 --> 41:36.760]  years ago uh the british had really developed it but the
[41:36.760 --> 41:43.080]  a uh french economics professors developed the
[41:43.080 --> 41:48.440]  the the the the tome or the handbook of mercantilism and i've
[41:48.440 --> 41:50.840]  talked about it before but to understand new world order globalism you got to
[41:50.840 --> 41:56.760]  understand this this is the key to everything
[41:56.760 --> 42:00.360]  french possessions
[42:01.080 --> 42:04.360]  say in the case of uh the eastern half of hispanola
[42:04.360 --> 42:12.040]  what's hei today they would not allow under penalty of imprisonment or death
[42:12.040 --> 42:17.320]  even french citizens who were living there and running sugarcane plantation
[42:17.320 --> 42:23.160]  you know slave plantations to build a pickaxe to to forge a shovel
[42:23.160 --> 42:28.760]  to make a firearm to have any value added product there were even rules
[42:28.760 --> 42:35.160]  against uh glass against blowing glass and you study this in
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.080]  same thing in the in the british run colonies that is of course the original
[42:39.080 --> 42:45.000]  13 states before that the 13 colonies and then later when people would revolt
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.360]  they'd say okay well we'll just put a big tax on finished goods
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.040]  they would only allow colonies to produce raw material
[42:52.040 --> 42:55.960]  so that it would have to be shipped back to the imperial seat
[42:55.960 --> 43:04.200]  the imperial keep and once it was shipped there and once it was in place
[43:04.200 --> 43:11.160]  there then they would sell it back as value added
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.240]  to the people in the colonies and that was used as a form of control
[43:15.240 --> 43:18.920]  now that's mercantilism now what we live under today what we're
[43:18.920 --> 43:26.120]  entering now is neo mercantilism and and no one else sees this no one
[43:26.120 --> 43:28.920]  else talks i've been talking about this for 15 years because i've studied
[43:28.920 --> 43:32.440]  mercantilism i looked at globalism i looked at what they said globalism was
[43:32.440 --> 43:36.200]  and it was mercantilism without the name and i'm waiting for professors
[43:36.200 --> 43:39.880]  and economists and others to pick up on this i mean am i really smarter than
[43:39.880 --> 43:42.920]  you as someone studying economics and history no
[43:42.920 --> 43:48.280]  you're just not seeing it but arose is still arose by any by any
[43:48.280 --> 43:54.040]  other name this is mercantilism and so the Arabs aren't allowed in their deals
[43:54.040 --> 43:57.800]  to produce any manufacturing they've got to buy their jet airplanes and their
[43:57.800 --> 44:03.160]  caterpillar equipment their bulldozers and cranes
[44:03.160 --> 44:07.080]  from european or u.s companies they've got to buy
[44:07.080 --> 44:11.080]  you know their software from the japanese or the chinese
[44:11.080 --> 44:15.000]  and in the agreements they signed in the mid 1970s this is on record
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.320]  they had to agree to spend the lion's share of their oil money
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.440]  back into the u.s to buy t-bills and thus prop up the dollars the world
[44:24.440 --> 44:29.320]  was our currency now what ken from told williams
[44:29.320 --> 44:32.200]  a few months ago before he died and what the other even more high-powered guy
[44:32.200 --> 44:35.880]  just recently told him is exact and he said all this in october was going to
[44:35.880 --> 44:38.440]  happen that the middle east would go into flames
[44:38.440 --> 44:42.200]  i said war and he goes no destabilization but then later
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.200]  that was just a distraction towards china but that it would drive up oil
[44:46.200 --> 44:51.800]  prices to 150 to 200 you just saw him go up nine percent today
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.560]  okay and so the arabs have been set up they've
[44:55.560 --> 45:01.080]  invested in t-bills now as the dollar is basically phased out into the new
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.960]  global sd yard will still be there will just be a component of it
[45:07.400 --> 45:10.920]  the arabs are going to just basically be put into turmoil
[45:10.920 --> 45:14.120]  let a bunch of you know wild crazies fight over power
[45:14.120 --> 45:17.400]  nothing destabilizes things better they will implode
[45:17.400 --> 45:20.840]  oil production will be put into doubt and then huge oil production is going to
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.280]  then finally be brought back in the united states but we're going to pay
[45:24.280 --> 45:29.320]  exorbitant prices for it the united states will then go into a long period
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.000]  of decline in which china is built up as the new
[45:33.000 --> 45:37.640]  global force and enforcer but then at a later date the united
[45:37.640 --> 45:41.640]  states will be risen back up again so the bankers can
[45:41.640 --> 45:46.200]  use the u.s as a play against the chinese the chinese is a play against the u.s
[45:46.200 --> 45:49.720]  so it's three-dimensional very complex chess
[45:49.720 --> 45:53.640]  now here they are giving you the religion of the new world order in this
[45:53.640 --> 45:58.200]  what 1974 network clip where howard bill is called in
[45:58.200 --> 46:02.440]  by the head of the conglomerate to explain to him the religion of the new
[46:02.440 --> 46:05.960]  world order here it is you have meddled with the
[46:05.960 --> 46:12.200]  primal forces of nature mr bill and i won't have it
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.600]  is that clear you think you've merely stopped a business deal
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.680]  that is not the case the Arabs have taken billions of dollars out of this
[46:20.680 --> 46:25.320]  country and now they must put it back it is airmen flow
[46:25.320 --> 46:30.200]  tidal gravity it is ecological balance
[46:30.200 --> 46:36.840]  you are an old man who thinks in terms of nations and peoples there are no
[46:36.840 --> 46:39.160]  nations there are no peoples there are no
[46:39.160 --> 46:43.640]  Russians there are no Arabs there are no third worlds there is no west
[46:43.640 --> 46:51.400]  there is only one holistic system of systems one vast and the main
[46:51.400 --> 46:55.160]  interwoven interacting multivariate multinational
[46:55.160 --> 46:58.680]  dominion of dollars petro dollars
[46:58.680 --> 47:02.840]  electro dollars multi dollars rank marks rings
[47:02.840 --> 47:09.560]  rubles pounds and shakers it is the international system
[47:09.560 --> 47:14.040]  of currency which determines the totality of life
[47:14.040 --> 47:22.600]  on this planet that is the natural order of things today
[47:22.600 --> 47:30.120]  that is the atomic and sub atomic and galactic
[47:30.120 --> 47:37.560]  structure of things today and you have meddled with the
[47:37.560 --> 47:47.960]  primal forces of nature and you will atone
[47:47.960 --> 47:51.320]  am i getting through to yours to bill
[47:53.800 --> 47:59.320]  you get up on your little 21 inch screen
[47:59.320 --> 48:06.600]  and howl about america and democracy there is no america
[48:06.600 --> 48:14.760]  there is no democracy there is only ibn and itt and atnt
[48:14.760 --> 48:22.840]  and dupont dowl union carbide and exxon those are the nations of the world
[48:22.840 --> 48:26.280]  today what do you think the russians talk about in their
[48:26.280 --> 48:29.800]  counsel's estate carmark they get out their linear
[48:29.800 --> 48:33.160]  programming charts statistical decision theories minimax
[48:33.160 --> 48:36.680]  solutions and compute the price cost probabilities of their transactions
[48:36.680 --> 48:40.360]  and investments just like we do we no longer live in a world of
[48:40.360 --> 48:45.960]  nations and ideologies mr bill the world is a
[48:45.960 --> 48:52.040]  college of corporations inexorably determined by the
[48:52.040 --> 48:56.760]  immutable bylaws of business
[48:57.800 --> 49:02.760]  the world is a business mr bill
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.880]  it has been since man crawled out of the slime
[49:09.320 --> 49:18.440]  and our children will live mr bill to see that
[49:19.720 --> 49:27.000]  perfect world in which there's no war or famine or
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.560]  oppression or brutality one vast and ecumenical
[49:33.560 --> 49:38.680]  holding company for whom all men will work to serve a common
[49:38.680 --> 49:45.240]  profit in which all men will hold a share of stock
[49:45.240 --> 49:53.880]  all necessities provided all anxieties tranquilize
[49:53.880 --> 49:58.760]  all boredom amused
[49:59.800 --> 50:05.080]  now i have actually had big network type heads and people that have tried to
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.480]  hire me that i've you know met with privately
[50:07.480 --> 50:10.920]  unconditioned anonymity to be offered things it's okay to talk
[50:10.920 --> 50:14.440]  and you basically get a speech like that globalism is going to help people
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.040]  yeah the new owners real but you just don't get it no i do get it
[50:18.040 --> 50:21.400]  you're a bunch of control freak murderers putting poison in the water
[50:21.400 --> 50:24.680]  this isn't some lovey-dovey happy world government
[50:24.680 --> 50:28.120]  oh yeah they're gonna entertain us with sports while they're putting lithium
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.440]  and other toxins in the water while they're putting cancer viruses on our
[50:32.440 --> 50:35.240]  vaccines as they've been caught doing at
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.480]  infinitum and so world government is death kind of
[50:39.480 --> 50:43.640]  like uh that issue of
[50:44.920 --> 50:50.680]  what was the uh january 2010 issue of
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.800]  national geographic it said oh the whole world's going to be the
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.040]  model basically of singapore it's like slitting your wrist and getting in a
[50:58.040 --> 51:02.440]  hot bathtub of water we all know that burky water
[51:02.440 --> 51:06.120]  purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration as an

[55:04.440 --> 55:08.760]  currency and money how much is a healthy slave worth
[55:08.760 --> 55:11.880]  and you go to the slave auction every culture had it and there was a set
[55:11.880 --> 55:14.760]  amount and it would be exchanged generally in gold
[55:14.760 --> 55:17.880]  or they could make side deals but it wasn't as easy
[55:17.880 --> 55:21.640]  it didn't grease the skids as quickly for commerce if you wanted to pay
[55:21.640 --> 55:27.560]  okay i'll give you 50 pigs or i'll give you three cows for that slave
[55:27.560 --> 55:31.320]  that's where money came from and people around the world settled in on silver
[55:31.320 --> 55:34.360]  and gold didn't matter if it was the ads text
[55:34.360 --> 55:39.000]  didn't matter if it was the ancient japanese the chinese uh the visigoths

[56:05.960 --> 56:09.720]  are things that have value in history information
[56:09.720 --> 56:14.440]  value but they set your role models for you and
[56:14.440 --> 56:19.080]  tell you it's just in beaver it's
[56:21.240 --> 56:24.920]  american idol and and and so people are brought up from
[56:24.920 --> 56:29.320]  being in diapers in front of a television set being taught this is what has value
[56:29.320 --> 56:33.000]  the number one thing you teach a child is what really has value in life
[56:33.000 --> 56:37.560]  their morals their information their mind and then what true physical wealth is
[56:37.560 --> 56:41.560]  but instead we're just told wealth is being into a football game
[56:41.560 --> 56:44.600]  and we go and pay all this money and sit there and feel like we're part of
[56:44.600 --> 56:49.800]  something big and and and that our team our tribe is winning a war
[56:49.800 --> 56:54.760]  it's all socially engineered you know the drudge report yesterday i gave us a

[58:54.440 --> 58:58.520]  ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find
[58:58.520 --> 59:02.280]  work might not agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and
[59:02.280 --> 59:04.280]  government employees but for the rest of us
[59:04.280 --> 59:08.120]  things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either

[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.960]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:14.920]  you want answers well so does he keys alex jones
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:23.240]  on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:29.480]  we are now back live into hour number two or 33 minutes away from lindsay
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.000]  williams dropping the biggest bombshells ever and believe me it's big
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.240]  and again most of it's in plain view but this is inside confirmation
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.680]  on the fact that they have triggered the implosions of the middle east not that
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.320]  people didn't have a reason to be mad or revolt
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.760]  the point is is that it was globalist triggered google
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:53.080]  state department cia british intel is all over it as well
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:57.080]  all of this is happening right now and it is meant to basically start disrupting
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.200]  well production and to put these countries in a geopolitical
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.720]  turmoil and then to bring well production online in the united
[01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:09.240]  states but at exorbitant prices um and this is from again two
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.000]  different williams sources and he said all this back in october four
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.400]  months ago he said the middle east is going to be in turmoil not so much war
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.080]  he said but then look at china after that china is the big one
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:25.720]  and now his other big source is even more high power than the late from
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.520]  and again the source is known to yours truly told him
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.320]  and people like well why don't you call and get him on that's the whole point
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.240]  they don't want to come on they do it through an intermediary
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.240]  that's how globalists operate they just want us to know
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:47.720]  it says part of their enjoyment um but in the case of from uh he uh
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.240]  lindsey believes he did become a christian before he died and uh was truly
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:54.200]  repentant for a lot of this i don't know about the other one in fact we're
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.840]  going to talk about that with uh williams coming up
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.120]  i keep trying to not say the name of the other guys
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.680]  now i'm almost set up a bunch today and i've got to
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.360]  got to shut my mouth because i've known it for over a decade but you know it's
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.200]  lindsey source the guy talks to him people are like
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.640]  well just you know have him come on air i mean it's kind of like somebody like
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.160]  charlie sheen is a fan of my show and we're friends so he'll he'll come on
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.920]  the show or he'll he'll talk to me people are like well why don't you
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.280]  you know get him on other shows or something i'm not my brother's keeper
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:30.120]  it's the same thing with with connections like this but
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:34.520]  this is really really
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.400]  painful news but it's as patrick henry said it's better to know the truth the
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.400]  whole truth and make preparations for it now use the analogy of if you're
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.080]  going to go coyote hunting out in the field
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.120]  and there's a cliff at one end of it and uh you know the guy you're going hunting
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.360]  with says be sure and take a flashlight and
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:59.640]  watch out because out there there's a 200 foot drop-off cliff
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.240]  i mean is it negative to say hey there's a cliff down there at the end
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.440]  watch out it's a steep drop and you don't really see it to get right up on it
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:11.000]  because there's some bushes over there uh just you know be sure that
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.840]  you know you use your flashlight so you get in position
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.120]  and then you go out there and put your blanket out on the ground get your
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.120]  tripod ready turn on the varmint tapes for those
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:27.320]  that don't know the sounds of uh of coyotes pray
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.120]  because the coyotes are you know killing your sheep or whatever and then you
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.960]  got your night vision scope out or your spotlight and then come the coyotes but
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.400]  the point is that it's not negative to say hey
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.920]  there's a cliff over there uh you the reason i tell this story is it's
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.360]  actually a true story i use the analogy to make it simpler if
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.640]  there's a pit out there you know is it is it negative
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.600]  to tell somebody hey there's a there's a pit out there you can fall and break
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.040]  your leg be sure and use your flashlight
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.240]  no that's not negative that that's incredibly positive well thank you for
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:02.840]  telling me there's a cliff or a pit
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.120]  you know it's like if uh you know your kids are going over to visit other
[01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.280]  kids and they're playing in the front yard and
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.680]  you know the dad says uh hey watch out guys don't play football on the street
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.120]  teenagers come through here all the time going 80 miles an hour
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.040]  oh you're so negative saying hey be careful kids don't play football on the
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.680]  street even though this looks like a residential street
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.440]  these kids drag race up and down it when they get off school every day watch
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.720]  out oh that's incredibly negative telling you
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:35.000]  know you know telling somebody not to play football on the street
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.840]  that's what we do here hey there's a pit right there here's the evidence hey
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:43.720]  there's don't play in the street they drag race on the street

[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:20.680]  information here first on this broadcast he gave me a detailed briefing last
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.680]  night about eight o'clock here at the office of the telephone
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.560]  and uh it's the it's basically the total global
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.560]  perspective on what the new world order is planning to do and what they've
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.840]  triggered the middle east and i called lindsay yesterday
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.560]  in the morning to try to get him on and he wasn't even ready yet because he just
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:44.200]  learned this information he wanted to write notes and codify it
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.760]  uh because i called him i said man four months ago in october
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.400]  folks can pull up those that interview we did several he was told by
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.000]  mr x and mr fram who's now dies we can say his name
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.480]  uh that well you're gonna watch the middle east you're gonna see a bunch of
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:05.560]  term all there but then after that it's china china's the big one but now
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.000]  a lot of what he was already told in the new info all comes together and
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.520]  the other individual was very clear with him about what's going to happen now
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.880]  this doesn't mean it has to happen a lot of times you know in war or business or
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.560]  life if you catch him with their pants down and we're aware of the truth of
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.000]  what's happening and everything williams is going to say is already hidden in
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.880]  plain view and mainstream news but it's a piece here a piece there
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.840]  you get the outside of the jigsaw puzzle and it gets quicker and quicker as you
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.800]  put the final pieces in we've got all the pieces
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.200]  we've just got to illustrate it for people so they understand what's
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.920]  happening but there's a lot more coming up lindsay
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.600]  williams will be joining us i want to go over the
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.480]  latest developments in the middle east north africa
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:48.760]  qaddafi uh what's happening in honduras what's
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:53.560]  happening with the protest uh around uh the united

[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.640]  quote healthy and to tax salt and do all this but meanwhile
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.640]  at the super bowl or veil colorado wherever she is it's just gobbling case
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.640]  though ribs brockwurst uh you know the most
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.000]  fattening stuff there is which i believe a little bit of is probably good for
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.600]  you uh but especially for your brain brain actually
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:21.320]  operates off that cholesterol but uh that is a another topic entirely i'll
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:25.240]  try to get to that but i do want to just remind you that it is the sponsors that
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:30.920]  make this radio broadcast possible and whether you buy the books the videos the
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.040]  bumper stickers the t-shirts which are great ways to get the word out at
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.280]  info wars dot com that's how you support us
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.880]  and also our sponsors also please support our local m and fm
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:44.200]  local sponsors or if you're a listener uh sponsor us you know support the show

[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.160]  growth curve is actually frightening uh and uh you know drudge is putting out
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.600]  tweets about how great we are i mean it's it's we just joined us already again
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.720]  it's so cool just because i really obviously he's the guy who can set so
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.840]  much of the media agenda he's he's an icon uh in in the internet i mean he's
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.280]  the biggest there is and uh we know we can tell he's
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.560]  been listening and posting our stories for a long time but
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.800]  um and he's another other little tips of the hat but this is this is this is
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.040]  out in the open uh his twitter yesterday there is no rest when you are involved
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.120]  in reality alex jones it was posted as a quote and then he
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.280]  has the date of when i said at austin texas to 2011 he was listening sunday
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.480]  and he goes on to say does urgent radio six days a week
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.760]  web dvds charlie sheen budd and he posted that at 5 27
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:43.480]  p.m uh yesterday and so that is uh very very interesting appreciate
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  tip of the hat there drudge i mean what does it mean that drudge is a listener
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:53.480]  you can see the change in his website i mean oh in fact i forgot in 2008 2009
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:56.920]  2010 no u.s media would cover the bilderberg group
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:02.680]  but george norrie and the epoch times but i forgot starting in 2008 drudge
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.400]  was linking to it and and and so it's gone from being laughed at just three
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.240]  years ago to now bilderberg groups out in the open and at the time we pointed
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.240]  out that drudge was the one that took i mean he was posting some days two of
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.280]  our articles a day on bilderberg but also mainstream articles out of europe
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:24.280]  breaking that news blockade here in the u.s and that's why the globalists want
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:27.880]  this internet kill switch and to be able to start curtailing quote content
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.960]  farms as google said three weeks ago uh like
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.800]  info wars and drudge report dot com uh sites that aggregate news and
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:39.800]  information that link to it but also make commentary on it
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.560]  they're now putting in algorithms to start trying to block that i mean they're
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.800]  there the system is worried i mean look at libya they're jamming right now al
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:51.880]  jazeera and other foreign satellite coming in in fact it's so powerful it's
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.880]  jamming in all over the middle east most areas can't get it
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.040]  well look what our government's got the internet kill switch going in the
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:04.360]  eas emergency alert takeover systems i mean it's creepy when they start putting
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:09.400]  this stuff in because you know they're bringing us into a period of massive
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.640]  turmoil and so the globalists are putting the screws down
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.880]  they're they're trying to start moving towards
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.680]  restricting free speech there's open talks about bringing back the fairness
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.720]  doctrine to restrict free speech on talk radio
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:28.360]  there's open discussions about arresting people that talk about manmade
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:32.520]  global warming that's cast sunstein white house regulations are i mean they're
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:37.000]  really out in the open lieberman talking about it senator j rockefeller saying
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.320]  we'd be better off without ever having an internet
[01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:43.480]  he just has habit you know that we shut it down and shut down fox and msnb
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.520]  c he doesn't want any political discourse he doesn't want
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:49.720]  any heated debate even within the fake left-right paradigm
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.840]  because that leads to thinking and then even though it's fake on fox and msnbc
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.840]  most of it it's it it it makes politics a sport
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.800]  instead of football being a sport and that could lead to people
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:07.160]  becoming real connoisseurs of of politics and getting out of this controlled
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:11.560]  paradigm but what about that quote drudge
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.960]  picked up that i just set off the top of my head out of my heart
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:20.600]  there is no rest when you were involved in reality alex jones
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.360]  there is no rest i mean when you only care about beer and entertainment and
[01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:27.400]  don't even care about yourself or your own family and you're just kind of
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.240]  self-serving yourself at a bestial low-level animal
[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:38.280]  point then you are so relaxed you're like a
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.120]  sloth who isn't even alive look at all the big studies in fact let's put it on
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.880]  screen for folks uh tv viewing all simers
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.280]  television all simers studies out of the u.s england canada
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.520]  you name it japan i mean there's hundreds of them scientific studies
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.840]  that when you watch a lot of television they have the different ratios
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.000]  it actually lowers your brainwaves it actually puts you into a mesmerized
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.280]  almost dreaming state and it and that it brings on early all simers
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.480]  because the brain start stops making connections
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.360]  because you sleep eight hours a day and you watch five hours of tv
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:19.960]  you're still sleeping and there's the headline bbc tv link to all simers
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:23.640]  so there is no rest when you are involved in reality
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:28.360]  but you're totally alive and every moment is dynamic and and and burning
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.040]  with creativity and understanding to the point of i almost just fly off the
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.440]  rails every day because i reality is so
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.160]  intense and i want to know reality i want to

[01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.520]  oh you're not supposed to do it you're not supposed to do it
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:16.200]  it's evil if you do it let me go over some of these headlines here
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:22.600]  mediev sees fires for decades in arab world russian president
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.480]  dmitry mediev on tuesday predicted decades of instability in the
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.840]  arab world in protesters whom he calls fanatics come to power
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.120]  adding no such scenario will be permitted at home
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.320]  mediev's words fall in sharp contrast european union
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.520]  which had a statement on monday that it deploys the violence and repression
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:44.600]  against the pro-democracy protesters and again those are dictators and i'm not
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.400]  against them being overthrown but what do they get and who's behind it the
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.720]  globalist and a lot of these folks know how to drive
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.080]  tanks and launch rocket propelled grenades there's obviously special
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:55.560]  op globalist it would sleeper teams in there

[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.160]  because they didn't put qaddafi in they did put hazy mubarak in
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:14.840]  and they knocked him out now and then the next military dictator rolled into
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.120]  place who will get behind all these new wars
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.920]  speaking at a security meeting in caracas mediev uh didn't name countries
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.480]  but he was referring to the crisis the middle east north africa
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.280]  which has brought down governments in tunisia and egypt spark protests in
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:34.680]  libya yemen Bahrain iran marocco and jordan and it continues uh the russians

[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.000]  under all this pressure and stress folks and i just enjoy the amazing things
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.120]  like carl orfs karina barana it just it it just shows you the potential of
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.800]  humanity but i briefly wanted to get ted anderson up here during the short
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:47.160]  segment for just a few minutes because i want listeners to be able to take
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.040]  advantage of this opportunity he bought a bunch of golden
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.320]  silver a month ago when the globalist artificially driven it down but the
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.920]  10-year graph it's going straight up we knew it would go right back up
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.800]  we've got the inside sources plus they're devaluing the currency it doesn't
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.880]  take a rocket scientist to know this and so ted told me this morning he said he
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:08.040]  is going to run out very soon on the very best golden
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.840]  silver deals he has because when he runs out of that
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:15.080]  then he's got to charge you you know for what he has bought the new golden
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:17.320]  silver for in a higher price and he's a big broker
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:21.880]  so he gets a good deal regardless but the deals he's got right now
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.640]  are off the chart and i want people to get into golden silver if it's one silver
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.880]  coin one gold coin whatever the case is it's time to move into it today
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.800]  golden silver skyrocketing again oil up nine percent
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.960]  in just the first few hours of today ted where is golden silver right now
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:41.800]  well gold hit a high today of let me just take a quick peek here just take
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:47.480]  and see if it went okay 1407 60 and silver hit a high today of 3348 gold
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:52.280]  right now is at 1399 70 silver right now at 3291
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.960]  i mean it is strong out of this world off the charts i mean you call it what
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:59.160]  you want uh with the libyan crisis going on
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:01.240]  and oil prices shooting up through the roof
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.120]  obviously that bodes very well for precious metals
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.880]  i mean 97 dollars your three videos some silver dollars
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:10.760]  i don't know how people can just beat that i mean
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.720]  first of all silver is well over into the 30s now
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:17.960]  there's three silver dollars in there alone and this is less than 30 bucks
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:23.000]  you just can't you know a piece 97 dollars delivered when you multiply by
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.560]  three obviously that's going to be a higher number than that
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:30.200]  but anyways and and the the uh you know the the whole thing the
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:35.480]  the uh frank coins at 1308 the british sovereigns at 1386 walking liberties at
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.000]  1576 now there's so much pressure on the bottom
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.800]  side of this market it's pressing things forward
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.400]  people really need to be getting involved in the golden silver
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.240]  obviously we're just i mean this whole middle eastern thing
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:52.920]  looks like the makings for world war three and i gotta
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:56.360]  got hope it don't go there but uh you know
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.480]  you know we just the united states has got this printing press running on
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:05.400]  in in our on our shores we've got this war going on and
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.720]  and and a complete collapse in the middle east oil prices rising
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.640]  inflation in china it's like this perfect storm economically
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.080]  and uh you know all that stuff has upward pressure for gold
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.520]  and we're seeing that right now i mean to be clear you get three silver
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.080]  dollars that are trading for basically 34
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.040]  dollars a piece right now uh so that is above 100 dollars to get three in the
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:32.440]  open market three of those for 97 dollars with the shipping included
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:36.920]  and obama deception fall the republic in game a 60 dollar value so that's over
[01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.760]  a 70 dollar discount on top of it on that silver
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.960]  dollar deal but i hope when folks call they'll get some of the
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.200]  other great gold coins you've got buffalos you've got the ron paul gold

[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.760]  out of kind and size
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:05.080]  pastor Lindsey Williams a few grand ordained Baptist minister
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:10.520]  he went to Alaska in 1971 as a missionary the Transalaxa oil pipeline
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.240]  began its construction phase in 74 and because of mr. Williams love for his
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.240]  country and concern for the spiritual welfare of the
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.240]  pipelineers he volunteered he's also a pilot they're flying people to serve as
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:25.560]  a chaplain on the pipeline with the subsequent full support of the Alaska
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:28.920]  pipeline company because of the executive status
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.520]  accorded to him as chaplain he was given access to information
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:35.960]  documented in his eye-opening book the energy non-crisis
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.240]  unfortunately out of print because to understand what's happening now you
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.760]  got to read that book and everything in that book from 1980 that
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:48.200]  caused oil execs to get fired you name it now it's all plain view admitted
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:51.000]  after numerous public speaking engagements in western states certain
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.960]  government officials are concerned individuals urge Williams to put
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.880]  into print what he saw and heard stating that they felt this information was
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.440]  vital to national security and actually Ken from actually helped him rewrite the
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.800]  book he wrote part of it that was the Atlantic richfield head of operations
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.320]  mr. Williams firmly believes that whoever controls energy controls the
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:12.280]  economy thus the energy non-crisis now
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.120]  Ken from died back around Christmas of cancer
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.960]  we can now say it's Ken from I knew it was Ken from so did
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:24.760]  other people like dr. Stan Monteef Monteef's the type to not even though he
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:28.120]  believes Williams to go off what he's saying he went figured out called himself
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.640]  he's he's also talked to the other guy who's living
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:35.960]  was a former oil company CEO big three and
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.320]  there's been a strategic plan and and as we go to Lindsay I want to
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:43.720]  break it down to you this way but Zigny Brzezinski writes books saying they
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:48.280]  work in 25 and 50 year plans David Rockefeller in his
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.640]  book he wrote five years ago where he admits they want world government I
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:55.800]  forget the name of it will you google uh David Rockefeller's
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.880]  autobiography I want to put it on screen it's a side shot of him
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:05.960]  on the cover we've got it back there but it on page 435 he talks about how
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.680]  yes we're going to get rid of sovereignty yes we're going to do this but
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:12.840]  they talk about 25 and 50 year plans and an example of that because the
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.640]  general public has been taught oh wall street thinks in quarters
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:19.880]  no they get you to think in quarters so you're blind the larger geopolitical
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.440]  neo feudalistic neo mercantile system that is the new world order
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:27.960]  but in the 70s was a key catalyst for the next 50 year plan
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:31.400]  that's when these decisions were made and I've read Rockefeller I've read
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:35.080]  Kissinger I've read Brzezinski basically say almost everything but an
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.520]  availed way that Lindsay's been told that's the key I can
[01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:43.080]  verify all this separately just Williams is directly talking to these folks
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:47.800]  now and the info Lindsay gives us mirrors what we get from inside
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.920]  Bilderberg but here's an example I'm listening to W
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:56.440]  wo ai this weekend and they had a newscast about the 50 year water plan
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.680]  for texas with the federal and state government
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:01.800]  and how we were 20 something years into the last plan and they're going to
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.400]  reassess it and launch a new 50 year plan off the old plan
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:11.320]  for for water wells reservoirs desalinization plants on the coast
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:16.680]  on and on and on and and how the federal government's doing test right now
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:20.440]  with desalinization of saltwater aquifers as a test
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:28.520]  as part of the 50 year plan we are on 50 year time frames with subsets of 25
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:32.680]  where sometimes they readjust or reassess and so
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:36.040]  talking to Williams last night I'm gonna give him the floor here in a moment
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.640]  when he briefed me on this everything he was saying again was already public
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:43.720]  intelligence but they were filling in the missing pieces
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.640]  what Williams wrote about 1980 about the secret deals with Kissinger and the
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.720]  Arabs to buy tea bills and how at a time in the future they would
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:54.760]  shift to the global currency that's in trilateral commission documents from
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.560]  1975
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.440]  but people would laugh at Williams about that now all of
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:05.640]  of the previous part of the plan is public he's going to give you the rest
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.880]  of the plan and what the globalists are telling him
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:13.880]  his is going to unfold now remember Lindsey Williams was here in
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:18.440]  October in November in December and in October on record we wrote
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:22.280]  articles about it oil in the next year six months to a
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:26.280]  year to go to 150 to 200 turmoil in the Middle East
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.640]  not even so much war he said they told me turmoil that's on record
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:33.640]  destabilization campaign and that that would then lead to
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.440]  quote China watch the big one now the other big oil company former CEO is
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:41.880]  giving the full breakdown of this program in the Middle East
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.760]  what it's going to do in the US what it's going to do in Asia
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:49.160]  and the rest of the globalist blueprint and layout
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.600]  for what is about to happen in the next several years
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:59.800]  and the decade uh preceding it or following it and so now
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.360]  Lindsey Williams i'm going to attempt to give you the floor
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.480]  um and in fact you're going to be hosting the show
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:10.600]  at least for this segment the next i'll take you out at break
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:13.960]  but i'm going to actually go in the control room only way i can control
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.560]  myself and i'm going to be in there taking notes on
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:21.480]  points and questions i have for you but i sat there for 30 45 minutes with you
[01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:24.920]  last night and just shut up while you talked and it was 10 times more
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.200]  powerful than anything we've ever done on the radio before
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.560]  lay it out let's start at the beginning
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.800]  Alex you're a gentleman thank you so very much
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:40.120]  crude oil this morning is up eight dollars a barrel
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:46.440]  Libya the capital city Tripoli is burning the capital building
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:53.480]  in Libya is on fire right now Gaddafi is in power since 1969
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.840]  and this morning light sweet crude oil
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:04.040]  is 108 dollars a barrel i have been told that it's going to 150 to 200
[01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:07.480]  i would think that 200 would be more like it
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.320]  Libya has shut off all of its present oil sales
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:18.360]  it says it will carry no more contracts 1.6 million barrels of oil per day go
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.640]  to europe not to america but to europe this is going to drastically affect
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:30.360]  america because now europe oil supplies have got to come from somewhere else
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.960]  i would say that the middle east is pretty much
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.640]  number one item right now it's going to go to iran
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:43.080]  and it's going to go the crisis is going into saudi arabia
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:48.280]  so let me begin as i have been told by the people that have given me
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:51.800]  information over these years as alex has just said
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:55.080]  i want to start from the beginning so you can understand because this is very
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:00.680]  involved in 1901 the first what should we say
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.960]  gush here of oil in the united states of america took
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:08.120]  place in bowmont texas it was called spindle top
[01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:14.040]  it went up 200 feet at that point the major oil companies were formed they
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:19.240]  didn't exist before 1901 texaco shell standard
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.000]  oil of course which is a Rockefeller family and chevron
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.600]  had their beginning at spindle top in 1901
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.960]  this set the stage for the beginning of some things that would revolutionize
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:35.640]  the entire world and the use of crude oil
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:42.040]  and energy then in 1903 came henry forward the first assembly line
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:44.920]  automobile in america and then a man by the
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:50.360]  neighborhood say these in germany built the first assembly line
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:55.880]  german produced automobile now at that time american oil was 25
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:01.560]  cents a gallon or less and our economy was booming beyond
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:06.280]  everything the world had ever known oil was discovered in the arab
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.520]  middle east world now keep in mind that prior to
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.280]  the time that oil was discovered after 1903 in the Arab world that the Arabs
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:19.720]  were nothing but nomads from the deserts riding camels
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:25.880]  but 60 years ago the Arabs began to for the first time in many many centuries
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:29.880]  to come to the forefront this brings us up to where we are now
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:34.760]  and as alex has suggested i want to just cover a few corners and then i'll go
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.280]  back and take each one of them individually so that you can know the
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:41.960]  intricate parts of it
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:48.280]  kin from of atlantic richfield this is standard oil of course you recognize
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:52.760]  our co-atlantic richfield standard oil company
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:56.920]  one of america's greats back in those early days
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:03.960]  and the the the different oil companies uh texaco shell standard oil
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:08.040]  and chevron basically divided up the the arab world
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:13.000]  and each one of them took a country and said we will go and produce the oil
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.200]  fields in that country the Arabs didn't have the money to produce them
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.800]  and mr kin from was given the job by atlantic richfield
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.720]  of producing the oil field in two-way dubai
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.720]  and that part of the world kin from is a gentleman who's given me so much
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:31.400]  information over the years it was spent hours and hours together talking
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.000]  about what is happening in the arab world
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.240]  and which i'll go back and give in detail later now about 1977 through 81
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:45.880]  was a carter administration you'll remember that the
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:50.360]  um the secretary of state was minister Henry Kissinger
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:55.640]  he traveled abroad to every major oil producing country at that time
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.080]  and tried to cut them a deal i will go into that
[01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:03.400]  deal that he cut and why it is so significant to what's happening in
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:06.600]  america right now because at that point
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:11.880]  we began the indebtedness of the united states of america by a design plan and
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.720]  i'm so glad that alex mentioned the 50 year cycle
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.720]  because this is exactly what we are going through at this time
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:23.240]  uh i had not thought of that but alex you're right and i have heard this in
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:29.000]  many places at this point opic uh had an agreement and
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.920]  there was every nation in opic every major oil producing
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.320]  country in opic uh agreed to Henry Kissinger's deal with
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:41.560]  exception of two one was iraq and that's the reason
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.480]  that iraq had to be conquered and uh taken out and the next one was iran
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:51.080]  iran has had every kind of problem imaginable because they would not go
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:57.240]  along with this to Henry Kissinger's agreement back in 1977 through 81
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.880]  now at this point america began its debt spiral
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:07.080]  and someone needed to buy the united states debt Mr. Kissinger knew this
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.920]  and as a result the part of the cutting of the deal was
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:16.120]  that they would buy our t-builds buy our debt in turn we would buy their oil
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.960]  and at this point it was decided by the elite
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:24.840]  that the american oil fields would not be produced folks i hope you're hearing
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.280]  this because it's so significant to what they have told me now
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.080]  is about to happen the american oil fields would not be produced
[01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.920]  because the farmers we had to buy our oil from them
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.760]  in order for them to turn around and buy our national debt
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.120]  and they had to keep it that way they closed up
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.160]  oil wells everywhere they shut down major production from the
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:52.920]  audit wildlife refuge what was the back on oil
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.680]  preserve and others here in the lower 48
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:01.000]  they likewise said we cannot produce them because if we do
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.480]  then these other countries will not be obligated to buy our debt
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:09.320]  this also began the time that the elitist
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:12.920]  the bankers and others the world bank the imf
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:17.800]  began to bring about the destruction of america gradually
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:22.120]  you've heard me speak of the devil's messiah plan
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.840]  every bit of this fit into their perversion of the united states of
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:31.880]  america then came 1970 i'm just giving you a quick overview
[01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:35.320]  and then we'll go back since we have time in the program today to take these
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:40.920]  one by one in 1970 the alaskan oil was found somewhere
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:47.480]  around 1970 in 1974 through 76 the trans alaska oil
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:53.400]  pipeline was built and in 1976 one of the largest oil fields
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:58.120]  ever discovered in the world and in particular in the united states of
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:02.120]  america it's described in my book the energy non crisis
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.520]  gall island will blow your mind this is the story within itself because
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:11.000]  after gall island was brought in i was in the room with the oil company
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:15.240]  officials i later asked mr from why don't you bring
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:19.960]  this oil to the american people i had i knew already why
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:25.720]  they couldn't had no choice they could not bring gasoline back down to 25 cents
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:30.280]  a gallon again they could not bring it to 50 or 60 cents a gallon
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.760]  they couldn't because they were the the national debt had to be bought by someone
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:40.520]  the federal reserve was obligated and the national debt was growing so greatly
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.480]  and now gall islands are brought in and i said
[01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:47.400]  to ken why don't you bring this oil to the american people
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:52.600]  he said chaplain this is classified we are not going to release that oil we
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:55.400]  will never announce the oil field and the aortic
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:00.920]  wildlife refuge what is there until please this is so important put it down
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:04.680]  in your notes you're hearing things today for the first time
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:11.160]  he said we will not produce these oil fields until we have crude oil to
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:14.680]  somewhere around 200 dollars a barrel
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.360]  i said that in different places it got me in trouble
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:22.680]  i later was called on the carpet by the elite and i was threatened
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:26.440]  and it was mainly because of this one subject right here
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:30.840]  they had to get it to 200 dollars a barrel you are going to see
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.960]  150 to 200 dollar a barrel oil in the very near future
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:40.040]  you're probably talking somewhere in the neighborhood of nine to 12 months
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:44.600]  they have to take it there because the problems that have developed
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:49.080]  they developed them by the way the problems and the crisis that they have
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.520]  developed in the middle east will grow so great
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.040]  until america will not be able to get its oil
[01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:00.520]  from the opic oil producing countries of the middle east and saudi arabia
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:05.240]  in particular now lindsay lindsay i want to back up for just a
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:08.120]  moment and again just let listeners know the new
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:11.480]  information is coming up there's new information
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.080]  that deals with how this is going to be played off against the u.s
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:19.080]  how china is involved what the elite have told you the role
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.000]  for the united states is going to be in this we can already see this in their
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.280]  admitted globalist plans but this is directly relating
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.160]  to what's happening now in the middle east that you predicted
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:33.320]  from your sources in october of last year four months ago
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:37.080]  on this show and and so the really big bombshells are coming up but it's
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.200]  important for people to have the foundation please continue
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:45.800]  yes you're exactly right all of this fits into the total picture of china
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:49.880]  where mr prom told me before he passed away he said china is the big one keep
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.120]  your eyes on that but now the other sources filled that in for you
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.160]  yes the other sources just fill this in for me
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:02.360]  i think the the bombshell at this point that folks you definitely need to
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.040]  jot down is once they get that crude oil to the price of
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:08.680]  somewhere around two hundred dollars a barrel
[01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:12.200]  at that point they will have created so much chaos
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.960]  in the middle east as i mentioned at the beginning of the program
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.200]  libya triply the capital building in triply
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:24.280]  in libya is burning right now this moment as we speak
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.080]  in fact this morning arayan warships went through the suez canal
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:33.480]  Egypt finally gave him permission right now is this program is going on
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:37.240]  the latest information i've gotten this morning is that the iranian warships
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.680]  are through this is going to involve israel
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.040]  that part i don't even want to go into on the program because it would be a
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:48.360]  program within itself but well we got time stay there
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.680]  but but we're going to discuss this entire strategic program in the next
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:55.880]  step senate and where it's going to lead us if we don't
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:51:00.200]  expose this system this is the end of america as we know it if they're able to
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:03.000]  do this becoming a modern smoker is now

[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:08.200]  now remember lindsay williams six months before oil three years ago went from
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.640]  $50 a barrel roughly to upwards of 150 said it was going to happen
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:18.600]  and named dates we got similar intel out of bilderberg that year
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:22.600]  then lindsay said now it will go down to 40 it did go to 40 people laughed at him
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:27.000]  when he said it went from 150 to below 40 then he said for the next two years
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.520]  it will only gradually go back up but then he said in two years that was two
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:33.000]  years ago then watch for things to happen
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.600]  then he was told when the middle east starts blowing up get ready but then
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:39.480]  watch china now he's been given the full plan
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:42.760]  which again when i hear it it's it's it's there it's confirmed
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:46.920]  separately through research but this is from insiders now
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:50.120]  he said this four months ago last night he briefed me on this
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:54.200]  uh now today in fact i had the articles out there during the break
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.560]  here it is we'll put them on screen for prison planet dot tv viewers they're up

[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.400]  middle east see they don't so much run the fanatics they
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:15.640]  spurred them on helped them google admits
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:18.840]  that they were uh involved in all of it the state department
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:22.280]  and they're just gonna let them run wild and go crazy but it's not just so that
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:25.720]  the oil gets disrupted so they can now and that's what this is the big one that
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:29.240]  that because i've got three pages of notes that lindsay told me last night
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:32.040]  that they're that they're going to cheat the arabs
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:36.040]  and stop doing the deal where they don't allow production of the big wells here
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:39.480]  in the u.s not just alaska so it's not just that they're going to be in
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:42.760]  so much turmoil that's going to be the excuse and then they're going to
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:45.560]  cheat the arabs on that deal then they're going to stop buying the tea
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.400]  bills and that's going to further kill the dollar and that's the biggest one
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:53.160]  is that they are planning to kill the dollar and he's been given the time
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:57.560]  frame on all of this that's the big new giant information
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:00.600]  not from ken fromm told him similar things before he died from the other

[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.120]  listening audience i was a mere missionary flying
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.800]  airplanes out in the bush of alaska at the time they said they were going to
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:20.600]  build the trans-elastic oil pipeline the oil

[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.040]  it gave me favor with two of these individuals who are
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:43.640]  of the elitist of the world and they in turn

[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:48.040]  a listening audience out there alex that the elite know all of this in advance
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:52.040]  every bit of it is planned behind closed doors i had no way of knowing this i'll
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:55.000]  give you a few of the key pointers three years ago
[02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.840]  i was called on the phone by one of my latest friends
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:03.560]  and he said to me very casually uh he said chaplain the price of crude oils
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:07.400]  going from 147 dollars a barrel to 50 dollars a barrel
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:13.640]  everybody that played the futures everyone that had any prognostic notice
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:17.800]  idea whatsoever now first you said it was going from 50 to 150
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:20.920]  then you said it was gonna go back down to 40 and it did
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:23.960]  yes but everybody was saying it was going to 200
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.280]  even i myself was predicting that even though i had not been told it
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:33.240]  he said to me on the phone it's going to from 147 dollars a barrel to 50 dollars
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:38.520]  a barrel within two months time it went actually to 134 dollars a barrel
[02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:42.360]  and i knew that my reputation was at stake
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:48.600]  alex was bold enough and folks listen alex jones will put things on that
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.200]  nobody else will put on that was some talk show host that wouldn't even allow
[02:02:52.200 --> 02:02:56.200]  me on their show to say it they thought it was so ridiculous and outlandish
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:00.440]  but i knew that they've never told me anything wrong in 35 years
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:03.880]  and i said alex i'd like to come on your show and tell the people
[02:03:03.880 --> 02:03:08.120]  that it's going from 147 dollars a barrel to 50 dollars a barrel
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:12.120]  alex allowed me on his show to say it even though people laughed at me
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:15.400]  and some of you laughing at me i found the audience right now just keep right
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:19.560]  on laughing because you laugh last i know what's going to happen between

[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.360]  and to listen to everything that alex is telling you
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:31.160]  because the elite have it in plan so it did exactly what he said
[02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:35.400]  exactly two months later it went to a dollar and 50 cents a gallon of the
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:38.840]  gas pump it went to a dollar and 34 cents a gallon
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:42.920]  then at the same time he told me and you keep
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:46.920]  watch this now you'll see it happen he said the price of crude oil
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:51.000]  for the next two to two and a half years is going to stay between seven and
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.600]  eighty dollars a barrel everybody again thought i was crazy
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:58.440]  but i didn't want the one that said it the elite has told me that
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:02.840]  and it did it stated exactly that then i told you when it was going to start

[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:18.120]  worked in the board meetings with latik richfield and in meetings with other
[02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:22.440]  top well companies just like in congress or an aircraft carrier at the
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:26.440]  chaplain is like an intermediary uh and was able to see all this he wrote a
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.120]  book about it since then 30 years later everything in that book the
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:33.960]  energy non-crisis is now out in the open that they could have dozens of
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.240]  pipelines coming out of alaska supplying the entire united states for over
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:40.760]  100 years it's easily recoverable oil it's there
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:46.680]  they capped it now since then he has these two sources one of former ceo
[02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:49.000]  and i know for new listeners been listening the whole time here like we've
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.160]  already heard this i'm recapping for new listeners
[02:08:51.160 --> 02:08:55.160]  people are tuning in you know in and out constantly
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:58.440]  then starting about three and a half years ago uh ken from and the other
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.760]  fellow started telling him basically the same information that oil would go
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:08.120]  from 50 a barrel up to 150 then people thought we'd go to 200 his source said
[02:09:08.120 --> 02:09:13.000]  no now it's going to plunge down to 40 it went below 40 like 32 i saw it
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.400]  then they he said for two years it's going to be uh basically just gradually
[02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:21.720]  going up slowly enjoy yourselves go out and plenty of gas but in two years get
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:24.920]  ready we're now two years later four months ago
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:28.200]  lindsay says they're going to have a crisis in the middle east and i said war
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:31.640]  he said no my sources just said it's going to be in turmoil
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.880]  but that that is a trigger and a distraction from china watch it it's the
[02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.320]  big one but they didn't go further now mr fromis died
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.800]  the other source it has gone all the way with the entire plan and we can see the
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:47.400]  plan of deindustrialization moving all the jobs to china
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:51.240]  china in the news today secretly pressuring the u.s government
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:54.520]  as holders of our debt to allow them to buy up u.s companies
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:58.840]  and block sec corruption probes and antitrust issues
[02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:03.480]  this is about the globalist teaming up with china and muscling out the u.s
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.280]  this is about the designed decline of the u.s and lindsay's going to lay it all
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.280]  out now lindsay let's start back at the middle east the plan program there
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:16.600]  that's admitted uh where this is going how it's going to unfold
[02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:19.960]  you have the floor for the next uh 10 minutes
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:23.720]  the standard currency of the world is crude oil
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:27.880]  please write this down in your notes and i hope you have a pencil and paper and
[02:10:27.880 --> 02:10:31.480]  you're taking notes today and you'll put it beside your calendar
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:36.040]  because barring divine intervention the elite will do
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:40.760]  what you about to hear the standard currency of the world is crude oil it is
[02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:44.040]  not the dollar it's not the euro it's not the one
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:48.280]  it's not the pound it's crude oil crude oil
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.560]  please put it down it's the most important
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:56.760]  object out there the muslim brotherhood are being supported
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:03.320]  by the elite of the world who have the crude oil in the palm of their hand
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.840]  please note this what you saw happen in egypt
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:11.320]  what's happening right now in libya what is taking place in the united arab
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:15.960]  emirates is going to spread throughout the entire arab world
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:20.200]  most all of opec now opec includes a few other nations beside the arab world
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:24.440]  but all over the arab world it's going to continue because they are being
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:29.080]  supported by the elite of the world the elite of the world
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:34.120]  plan to double cross the arab i hope you've never heard this anywhere
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:38.600]  before this will be so new to you until i'm sure you're going to be startled
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:42.040]  as you have by many of the other things that these people have told me
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:47.960]  please note again the arab world the middle east in particular
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:51.720]  opec in general are going to be double crossed
[02:11:51.720 --> 02:11:56.680]  by the elite of the world and if any of the arabs out there listening to me
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:00.840]  i hope your princes your shakes and your sheets and the people of those countries
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:05.000]  will listen to you because 70 years ago you were nothing but
[02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.480]  nomad dromedadez is riding camels you're going back to that again
[02:12:09.480 --> 02:12:14.920]  i know and i must explain what the muslim brotherhood is doing later but i
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:18.840]  won't take the time right now why how you're going to be double crossed
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:22.440]  you remember that mr kissinger went abroad in 1977
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:25.880]  through 81 during the carter administration cut a deal
[02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:30.920]  with every then producing major oil
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:34.520]  country in the middle east and the deal was
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:38.920]  we will buy your oil we will no longer produce from america's oil fields
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:42.920]  oh a few little uh a few little wells here in yonda
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.240]  yeah we'll allow them to go but but nothing big whatsoever they're all
[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.160]  slope of Alaska we'll just cap a little bit of it but we're not going to get
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:55.960]  the big ones we will buy from you if you will do the following
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:00.840]  number one you must take a certain portion of what we buy oil from you with
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:06.840]  and buy our federal reserve issues of key builds and securities this in turn
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:11.240]  paid the interest on the national debt which at that point they began to bring
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:14.920]  in that new world order put america into the debt
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:20.520]  that is in today and bring america down to the status of a third world country
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:25.000]  it was all planned back as far back as i knew
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.400]  in 1971 they knew it a long time prior to that
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:33.640]  now how they're going to double cross the Arabs the dollar will be dead by the
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:37.800]  end of 2012 mark my words this was given to me by them
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.680]  it is prediction put it down and whenever it does what's going to happen to
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:45.880]  those billions and billions of dollars maybe in some
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:51.000]  cases trillions of dollars worth of key bills and federal reserve issues
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:54.280]  that have been sold to the oil producing countries
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:59.640]  according to the deal that was cut by Kissinger in 77 through 81
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:04.760]  what will happen to that paper please remember the previous show that i was on
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:08.280]  with alex jones i was told if it's written on a piece of
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.920]  paper it's worth the paper it's written on
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.920]  this could be a classical statement because it was told to be my mr prom
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:18.680]  before he died chaplain if it's written on a piece of paper
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:23.000]  it's worth the paper it's written on and when the muslim brotherhood
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.520]  supported today by the elite of the world
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:30.760]  continue to cause conflict all over the middle east as they have
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:35.800]  in Egypt and in libya and it will spread from one country to the other mark my
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:39.560]  words none of it will be exempt and when it does
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:43.320]  the oil will not be supplied from over there the dollar
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.440]  because when oil goes to two hundred dollars a barrel
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:50.280]  the american economy is going to be so drastically affected you think we have
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:54.200]  problems now financially the dollar will collapse
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:59.880]  toward the end of 2012 and when it does all of the paper
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:03.560]  please folks hear this especially arabs out there
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:07.160]  the dollar collapses the paper of the federal reserve
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:10.600]  will likewise do the same and when it does
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:16.760]  the double cross of the arabs which was started way back in 77 the double
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:20.120]  cross of the arab world will take place they will be so
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:24.600]  angry with us do you think that the muslims
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:28.120]  have have a bone to pick with us right now you haven't seen
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:31.080]  anything just wait till the dollar crashes
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:34.600]  they're double crossed they lose their paper wealth
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:37.960]  they become again what they were fifty to sixty years ago
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:41.560]  and are you ready for what's going to happen at that point this is the reason
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:45.000]  that alex has allowed me on his show today because i've just been told
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:49.560]  there's no matter of well it was ours when i talked with you last night alex
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:53.960]  but now it's a few days i was told that at that point we
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.640]  will not be able to get our crude oil from the middle east and many of the
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:03.560]  other opaque oil producing countries and in turn the elite plan to open
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:07.080]  america's own oil fields that they have known
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:10.760]  they've known for 50 years that they were there they knew about
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:15.480]  the north slope of alaska they knew about garland which i recorded in my book
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:18.120]  and they threatened me never to talk about it again
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:23.000]  and mr prom is gone now so i'm doing it and hoping that this
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.920]  this won't cause problems and the article wildlife refuge they will open
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:32.280]  america's own oil fields including the back end
[02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:37.240]  reserve including the reserve that is under the rocky mountains have you
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:41.160]  heard about it two trillion barrels it was announced
[02:16:41.160 --> 02:16:45.400]  on august 8 2005 president bush talked about it
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:50.200]  but they have not produced it yet all of these oil fields there is going to be a
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:55.160]  mad rush to oil production in america because we cannot get it from abroad
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:58.600]  when the arabs and opaque are double crossed
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:03.320]  and in turn you are going to see america begin to produce from its own oil fields
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:06.840]  but what's going to happen by that time you'll be paying seven and eight
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:10.760]  dollars a gallon for gasoline and it will be 200
[02:17:10.760 --> 02:17:14.200]  dollars a barrel our dollar will have already collapsed
[02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:18.520]  and they will bring in my words a world currency
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:24.280]  it is all a part of the new world order in order to accomplish
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:29.400]  what they want Alex well lindsay i mean just looking at the news here
[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:33.560]  kadafi declares revolt with tanks and planes
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:37.640]  he's defying the revolt with the tanks and planes in rambling speech blames
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:43.880]  tyranny of us free drugs for youth what the cia do in the 60s
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:47.320]  he went on to say he will never leave libya he will be a martyr
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:51.560]  at the end white house has nothing to say muslim brotherhood says kill kadafi
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:55.320]  all they want the power again they don't completely work for the globalist
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:18:01.320]  they're just being used continuing intelligence agency jamming tv signals
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:04.920]  kadafi's blocking al jazeera into the country and over much of the middle east
[02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:08.360]  with a powerful jammer saying that it's british intelligence which a lot of
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:12.920]  reports show it is and it's admitted and even medyev in russia
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:16.760]  is saying that this is staged in a destabilization program
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:20.280]  and that the middle east could be in flames for years
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:26.040]  and so this will be used as the excuse to start to change the deal to cheat the
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:29.400]  arabs you know that that's from the arab perspective
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:33.080]  to stop propping up the dictators to develop the fields here
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:39.880]  and getting into the dollar being phased out more on the information
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:43.720]  that the former oil company ceo told you on that front
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:49.400]  and the rising of china to replace us
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:53.640]  there will be no shortages whatsoever on grocery store shelves
[02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:56.840]  now when i said this for the first time about nine months
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.920]  i was laughed at there were many of your survivalists out there
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:05.000]  many of them my very personal friends that said lindsay you're crazy
[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.520]  we're going to have a shortage of food i said no we're not
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:12.840]  why i'd been told it what are we all going to have a shortage of
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:16.600]  the grocery store shelves will be full but you're going to go hungry
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:20.040]  why are you going to go hungry not because there's a lack of groceries out
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:22.440]  there even with the coal that we've had that's
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:26.760]  put down into mexico and florida and other places that all vegetables are

[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:11.240]  okay i talked a lot with lindsey last night about what the globalists are
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:14.120]  telling him that turmoil in the middle east is
[02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:18.360]  going to lead to how that affects the dollar
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:21.640]  the time frame for them opening up exploration
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:25.480]  and the fields that are already there and the role of china but
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:29.480]  and then the elite the elitist told lindsey
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:32.840]  that after a while though the us would be rebuilt
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:37.480]  but i want to get into any time frames any details exactly what he told you
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:40.840]  then for the rest of the hour we're going to take
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:46.040]  calls specifically on these issues with quick questions or comments for
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:49.400]  lindsey williams and people that call from the
[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.400]  middle east will go to the head of the line
[02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:54.280]  the problem is the genesis phone system only has six lines
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:57.960]  so i'm going to open up our phone lines here
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:00.680]  in about a minute or two it's a computer system so if you turn it on i just
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:04.760]  decided to do this for people in libya or in egypt
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.760]  not not not if you know somebody there if you're in libya if you're in egypt if
[02:25:08.760 --> 02:25:12.120]  you're in the middle east we're going to open up a middle eastern or north
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:20.280]  african line 877-789 alex 877-789 alex
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:23.720]  and people should be able to call an 800 number from the middle east right
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:27.800]  or no uh then give me uh can i give them that number
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.960]  okay okay this is the middle eastern line but it can't be told free
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:42.040]  i'm told 512-646-1776 512-646-1776 that is only the middle eastern or north
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:45.400]  african or moroccan you know where these stage
[02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:49.400]  rebellions are going on against old globalist dictators and others
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:54.280]  512-646-1776 will probably go a little bit into overdrive a day because this is
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:59.480]  too important 512-646-1776 if you're in the middle east
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:09.240]  your country code and then 512-646-1776 and the genesis number 800-259-9231
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:11.960]  for general callers that have questions for lindsay williams on lindsay
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:16.120]  this segment short but just boiling it down because you told me even more last
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:19.560]  night how the dominos will fall the middle east
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:23.640]  then the oil price then the opening up for exploration did he give you dates
[02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.480]  then this rise of china who we now know is basically running our government even
[02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:31.640]  the associated press is reporting that using the their debt they hold on us
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:35.320]  the cheating of the arabs break it down briefly for us
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:40.520]  time frame the end of 2012 you will see the dollar collapse so i've been told
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:44.600]  by the end of 2012 that means that the arabs are going to be double
[02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.440]  crossed by the end of 2012 sometimes prior to that
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:52.200]  whatever they are we don't get the oil supply from the middle east
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:55.320]  this is going to be a major crisis time for america
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:59.800]  because not only is it a crisis for you at the gas pump who having to drive your
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:03.320]  vehicle to work every day but it's going to be a crisis for the
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:07.160]  truckers the airlines and a major crisis for the
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:11.400]  military of the united states of america and that's the reason that they are
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:15.000]  so concerned about the fifth fleet right now over
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.440]  near around dubai and that part of the world
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:23.320]  so you have a time frame of the end of 2012 one person said to me this morning
[02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:25.880]  they said chaplain's going to take place in 2011
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:28.920]  it was the talk shows called me before you showed
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:33.880]  alex and i said no it's not i said i've been given the time at the end of 2012
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.880]  you'd better be ready they will do this by then china
[02:27:37.880 --> 02:27:42.920]  is the big one china just made an agreement with russia
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:47.080]  we're not this first china has a picture all together as far as crude oil and
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:50.600]  natural gas is concerned china just cut an agreement with
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:53.960]  russia russia last year became the number one oil
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:57.560]  supplier of the world saudi arabia took a second
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:00.760]  place because of russia's super deep wells which i've
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:05.560]  dealt with that subject before on alex's show and as a result china now has
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:08.600]  agreed with russia to buy all of the crude oil
[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:12.120]  and all the natural gas that they want china will not
[02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:16.760]  do you hear this china will not be affected by the middle east crisis
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:19.640]  because they're now getting their oil from russia
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:23.160]  we will not be able to get it there because they're supplying so much to
[02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:27.720]  china and as a result we will have to turn to our own oil fields here in
[02:28:27.720 --> 02:28:31.880]  america a time frame that you must be aware of
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:36.920]  is the end by the end that means you've better be ready a long time before
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:41.800]  if you want groceries you'd better go to the grocery store and buy six months to
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:45.960]  a year's supply right now because the dollar
[02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:51.080]  is going to collapse in such a manner even crude oil went up this morning
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:54.680]  eight dollars a barrel it wasn't the crude oil that went up
[02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:58.040]  it was a purchasing power over the dollar that went down
[02:28:58.040 --> 02:29:02.680]  and when that garlic which went up 100% in one week
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:06.760]  i don't simple little garlic bulb you housewives can see this
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:11.080]  you went to the grocery store it went up 100% in one week
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:14.280]  what did that do it wasn't the garlic that changed there's still as many
[02:29:14.280 --> 02:29:18.680]  clothes in that garlic as the ever was it was the dollar that you purchased the
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:22.520]  garlic with that is going down in purchasing power
[02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.920]  regardless of what the federal reserve is telling you you have better go and do
[02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:31.560]  what you're going to do and do it now and get something for your household
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:36.520]  and prepare for what's going to happen china will not be affected by this
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:39.480]  fuel prices because they're getting it out of
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:42.760]  russia and they're not using the american dollar for all right so the
[02:29:42.760 --> 02:29:46.440]  globalists are on the move i want to finish up with this rise of china
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:49.800]  decline of the us and then the rebirth of the us let's finish up with that then
[02:29:49.800 --> 02:29:55.080]  calls we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:55.080 --> 02:30:00.120]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:06.120]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:30:06.120 --> 02:30:09.320]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:13.320]  is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:16.520]  americans at home i have tremendous influence
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:20.920]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:25.800]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:29.720]  fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:33.400]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:36.680]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:40.440]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:44.280]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[02:30:44.280 --> 02:30:47.800]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[02:30:47.800 --> 02:30:51.640]  a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic
[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:55.560]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online

[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.600]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:09.800]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:12.680]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and
[02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:16.280]  government employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse
[02:31:16.280 --> 02:31:19.720]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long

[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:21.240]  because if we're aware of this program if we're aware of what the globalists are
[02:35:21.240 --> 02:35:25.320]  doing then people politically can stop it and
[02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:29.400]  understand the grand design by having the blueprint and
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:33.160]  normally when lindsay gets new information you know he puts it out on a cd
[02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:36.200]  it's quicker than a book his books out of print
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:40.120]  or a dvd but that takes a few weeks to produce
[02:35:40.120 --> 02:35:43.320]  and normally when he's ready he calls me because now he's ready to get the
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:46.920]  information out but i happen to call him right when he'd gotten this information

[02:37:21.480 --> 02:37:24.680]  the time frame you said they're going to rise china up
[02:37:24.680 --> 02:37:28.200]  then they're going to start the exploration here in the next few years
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:31.640]  then you're going to see a big decline in the us
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.800]  as they suck everything out of the economy everything is based on petrol
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:39.560]  based on oil and and this is going to be a vertical integration a
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:43.160]  consolidation of wealth but then your source said that later
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:47.480]  they're going to build the us back up what's the time frame on that
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:51.240]  i did not give a time frame on that it'll all depend on
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:54.760]  how they are able to open up what they want to open up
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.240]  the advancement of china keep in mind that if it's written on a piece of
[02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:02.600]  paper it's worth the paper it's written on and this is the way that they will
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:06.600]  cross double cross the Arabs written remember also
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:12.520]  that george bush senior daddy bush was the ambassador to china prior to that
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:15.000]  time please go back and look this up and get some
[02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:18.520]  information on it research it for yourself i don't have time to give it
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:23.000]  today no we'll do a whole section on this george bush senior daddy bush
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.480]  the great mr new world order was the ambassador to china from the united
[02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:31.080]  states of america years ago prior to his being ambassador
[02:38:31.080 --> 02:38:36.040]  china was a closed society the great wall of china divided them from
[02:38:36.040 --> 02:38:40.360]  everybody and china did not do business with the outside world
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:43.720]  george bush senior daddy bush opened up china
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:48.120]  to the world and made it the great power that it is today
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:52.200]  and he was the first one to announce that there would be a new
[02:38:52.200 --> 02:38:56.360]  world order and the globalists have done everything they can to position the
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:39:00.440]  industry the power to have china be the owner of our debt teamed up with the
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:03.240]  private fellow reserve the second biggest owner and now
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:06.040]  we covered it earlier if you guys can find that afp
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:10.840]  or ap headline china secretly using influence
[02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:13.960]  on the sec on the treasury department on the federal government
[02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:18.040]  to let them buy up us companies to let them create oligopolies
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:22.760]  to have the sec leave them alone to allow them to basically buy this country up
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:27.240]  there's afp cables show china used debt holdings
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:33.080]  to press us lead diplomatic cables vividly show china's willingness to
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:37.000]  translate its massive holdings of u.s. debt into political influence
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.200]  on issues ranging from taiwan sovereignty to washington's financial policy
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:47.320]  dealing with chinese companies in the u.s. and it just goes on and on and on i
[02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:50.760]  mean this this is the globalist plan we've been made dependent we're being
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:53.640]  taken over is this not high treason by the globalist
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:57.480]  Lindsey it positively is and the thing that the average american doesn't
[02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:00.920]  realize is that when we moved our industry to china
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:04.680]  for instance general motors whom you as a taxpayer
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:08.440]  bailed out in the united states of america they were bankrupt
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:11.000]  general motors in christly you bailed them out
[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:14.520]  general motors will sell more automobiles in china this year
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:18.440]  than they sell in the united states of america now what happens when general
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:22.120]  motors christler uh... caterpillar
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.480]  uh... the biggest one on new york stock exchange caterpillar
[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:29.640]  whatever these companies move to china and build these multi-million dollar
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:34.280]  billion dollar plants do you realize that the agreement with china is
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.440]  that yes let you come to china yes we'll give you cheap labor
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:43.960]  but you must give us all of your patents did you hear this
[02:40:43.960 --> 02:40:48.360]  burning when they moved to china they had to give all of their patents
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:51.800]  that pattern right well clinton gave them along with rumsfeld when he was in
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:53.720]  private companies in the mid nineties
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:58.120]  uh... the icb m secrets uh... the uh... submarine launched
[02:40:58.120 --> 02:41:01.960]  trident secrets this is a total sellout i know we've got mohammed in the

[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:44.360]  if they didn't know you got almost a hundred thousand
[02:42:44.360 --> 02:42:45.800]  americans
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:48.400]  living in in in egypt
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:53.240]  and frequently visit egypt and i'll say this not one american
[02:42:53.240 --> 02:42:54.480]  was harmed
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:57.520]  a citizen neither of none of us
[02:42:57.520 --> 02:42:58.920]  and
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:01.480]  it was surprising to hear
[02:43:01.480 --> 02:43:07.040]  uh... the families who were concerned about their their people the way america
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:08.720]  was portrayed
[02:43:08.720 --> 02:43:12.960]  the what was happening in egypt and i want to say this alex
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:15.160]  i want to go into
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:17.600]  what the egyptians are saying here
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:21.440]  yeah one of the i mean to the egyptians know this is a staged event
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:23.080]  absolutely
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:28.400]  let me tell you alex the egyptians know nothing about a group called
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:30.400]  the uh...
[02:43:30.400 --> 02:43:34.760]  the the the muslim brotherhood they have that they know nothing of this
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:36.640]  a matter of fact they say
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:39.680]  they say it's it's like c i a
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:41.600]  or america
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:42.560]  okay
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:45.320]  that's number one number two
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:48.280]  i would like to say this to all the people out there
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:50.240]  uh...
[02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:55.240]  the majority of people who was in the so-called liberty square
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:43:59.440]  the majority of these people are like had no idea
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:01.280]  about a revolution they wouldn't
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:03.840]  get there for their work but they
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:05.600]  paid to go there
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:09.720]  and if you know it if you ever uh... if you ever frequent the middle east you
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:12.760]  you'll you'll know that these are people who are family
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:16.920]  they frequent places together they'll be outside all day
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:18.600]  hundred at a time
[02:44:18.600 --> 02:44:22.240]  so it's nothing to get a few thousand people in a square
[02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:25.240]  now they said millions and it was fifty thousand according to experts that
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:26.200]  looks at the crowd
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:28.880]  but google admits they were there for the c i a
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:30.080]  they admit that they
[02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:33.000]  sent an alberida week before it all started and we're not seeing
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.440]  mubarak was good
[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:35.520]  the point is
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.040]  they are admittedly overthrowing it as the first domino as we said a month ago
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:41.960]  to put the middle east in fire
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:45.680]  uh... so so the egyptian people know what's going on
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.360]  a
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:49.040]  another thing i want to bring out all of them
[02:44:49.040 --> 02:44:50.720]  and you're right on there and
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:52.680]  i want to say this out
[02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:53.960]  one thing that
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:57.280]  the western world is not saying about mubarak
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:00.640]  is the fact that there's many egyptian
[02:45:00.640 --> 02:45:04.160]  who wanted new but mubarak to stay i'll tell you that
[02:45:04.160 --> 02:45:08.240]  mubarak it starts with against the eugenics program and have been on
[02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:09.160]  record for this
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:12.800]  not mad at him in the early nineties uh... what when he wouldn't start
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:14.720]  sterilizing people
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:16.080]  exactly
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:19.720]  and and the babies are healthy there the people are healthy there
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:22.880]  and i'll tell you the water is not the cleanest in the world but these people
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:26.520]  are fairly healthy compared to any other people in the western world
[02:45:26.520 --> 02:45:29.880]  i'll tell you that they're very family oriented
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:31.520]  and on top of that
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:33.120]  uh... there's another thing
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:34.880]  that people didn't know that
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:38.160]  and i didn't surprise me while i was here alex
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:40.800]  is that there's many americans
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:42.840]  after leaving the military
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:44.960]  come to the middle east uh...
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:46.320]  get contracts
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:48.280]  and work within the military
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:52.520]  make big big money over there in americans to come over and actually work
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:54.080]  under these people
[02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:56.120]  in the egyptian military
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:56.800]  so
[02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:01.080]  that there's a lot of facets to this that a lot of brothers and sisters and
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:03.800]  yourself you're right on point for you
[02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:06.080]  for you not to be in the middle east
[02:46:06.080 --> 02:46:08.920]  you may have to be contact because you're not in the middle east and and
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:10.740]  obviously you're able to
[02:46:10.740 --> 02:46:15.600]  articulate what's going on even in the middle east but i want to say that
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:17.080]  americans
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:19.040]  have no idea
[02:46:19.040 --> 02:46:23.000]  whether what's what's going on on the outside of america and you don't know
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:27.440]  until you until you go someplace exactly but but uh... any comments on what
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:32.320]  lindsay williams is saying
[02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:35.320]  uh... i want to thank lindsay because
[02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:38.520]  the last thing he said it's key
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:40.240]  uh... uh...
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:43.680]  the last thing he said about what's going on with the oil
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:46.840]  and how they're going to double-cross
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:50.440]  let me tell you all the egyptians and the other middle eastern
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:52.400]  knew that it was staged
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:56.320]  and now they're starting to realize that they were
[02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:59.360]  cropped in america in the western world game
[02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.680]  and it's not going to end out like they think it is these people
[02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:05.120]  these people
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:08.240]  have some level of integrity and fighting
[02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:10.800]  and and i'll tell you
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:13.500]  when they find out that they were used
[02:47:13.500 --> 02:47:17.640]  it's going to be all out anarchy on another level i don't think the western
[02:47:17.640 --> 02:47:18.720]  world can control it
[02:47:18.720 --> 02:47:23.240]  all right now i certainly the dominoes were already there folks being angry
[02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:26.920]  now they've triggered it is google i mean here
[02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:28.600]  is on record
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:32.160]  and now google just admits that this government front is so incredible thank
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:32.800]  you
[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:34.080]  for the call
[02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:38.440]  uh... brother i recall from cairo uh... lindsay williams your comments on what
[02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:39.920]  he was saying
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:44.000]  well i i'm so glad that he confirmed the fact that the arabians realize they've
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.280]  been they are going to be double-crossed
[02:47:46.280 --> 02:47:49.320]  that would open up they want double-crossed yet
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:53.200]  big double-crossed has yet to take place whenever the dollar collapses and they
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:54.760]  lose all the paper
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:55.880]  that they've invested
[02:47:55.880 --> 02:47:58.080]  invested in
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:47:59.560]  many many years
[02:47:59.560 --> 02:48:00.480]  and they've become
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:04.240]  or literally paupers overnight and to be clear this is going to double-cross
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:06.860]  americans and others but we see china and others
[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:11.080]  moving away from the dollar right now but your sources saying into twenty twelve
[02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.520]  the dollar is going to not be the world reserve currency what else did he say
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:16.360]  about that any specifics
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:19.800]  yet by the end of twenty twelve you'll see this double-crossed with the old
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:21.560]  pack all producing countries
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:24.680]  they intern will literally become a great group of america
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.240]  the colleges from each of those exactly right america will not be able to
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:29.360]  control it
[02:48:29.360 --> 02:48:33.360]  our president has made some drastic mistakes but that's part of the plan is
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:36.520]  enraging them that way the oil gets shut off
[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:38.520]  that's exactly right and then
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.480]  the price of crude oil will be up to two hundred dollars a barrel so that the
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:44.760]  all companies the elite of the world
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:46.440]  as i call them can become
[02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:47.720]  you think they're rich now
[02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:49.200]  you don't see anything
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:51.720]  wait until all gets to two hundred dollars a barrel
[02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:56.560]  and they produce it for america's a giant tax directly to the globalist it's a
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:59.800]  giant tax directly to the globalist let's talk uh... it's incredible
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.720]  david in south carolina you're on the air with lindsay williams go ahead
[02:49:03.720 --> 02:49:05.600]  they had to go and uh...
[02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:08.920]  i've got a couple of quick points to make you first of all i was just over in
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:10.440]  europe uh...
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:13.320]  flew over to the former soviet union republic of bella ruse
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:16.520]  stop by in australia on the way
[02:49:16.520 --> 02:49:22.440]  gas there get this okay is twelve point nine five euros a leader
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:25.720]  okay which was all going down with the egyptian crisis
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:28.660]  that's over eighteen dollars
[02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:30.280]  american
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:32.360]  for a leader of gas over there
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:35.400]  and gas is always more expensive over there anyways but that's going to go
[02:49:35.400 --> 02:49:39.040]  through the roof when that happens and in bella ruse it was twice as much for
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:39.720]  a leader
[02:49:39.720 --> 02:49:42.560]  well david i don't mean to interrupt you put you back on hold we're gonna skip

[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:49.520]  that this is really incorrect
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:54.120]  but you know i like to ask him from the north of you because you know he is you
[02:50:54.120 --> 02:50:58.840]  know he is a religious person
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:02.680]  can you tell us i look at you know my islamic religious script
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:05.680]  uh... that time for you coming is really near

[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:12.160]  when the things are going to be set up for everything
[02:51:12.160 --> 02:51:14.760]  so there is a religious point in all this you don't care
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:18.680]  now i understand what do you think sir sir what do you think about
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:21.920]  the demonstrations do you think they're staged what's your view of what

[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:27.480]  look at it there is no doubt it is staged
[02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:31.280]  there is no doubt it is staged
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:36.200]  it is a progress in ten of ten years and nineteen years ago
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:40.600]  that was not incised for two years and you know that communism works

[02:52:13.640 --> 02:52:17.720]  and they've seen a dramatic increase in fuel over there i think the deal from
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:19.240]  russia with china
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:22.880]  has affected that because they're not sending as much down in so of course you
[02:52:22.880 --> 02:52:24.680]  have the whole supply and demand issue
[02:52:24.680 --> 02:52:28.280]  and now with this issue with libya which as you said support supplies a lot of
[02:52:28.280 --> 02:52:29.520]  oil to the
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:31.400]  european um...
[02:52:31.400 --> 02:52:34.600]  union uh... countries that's going to get cut off
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:36.920]  so you're gonna see a major issue there
[02:52:36.920 --> 02:52:38.560]  uh...
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:41.720]  and it was just it was all just kind of you know coming
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:45.280]  you know on as i was over there for two and a half weeks uh... from july to the
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:48.840]  beginning of all did you hear lindsay as many listeners did four months ago say
[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:51.200]  this was all coming and lay it all out
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:53.040]  yeah i've i've listened to you every day
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:56.800]  so i've got called you you know i've talked to many times i wanted that
[02:52:56.800 --> 02:52:58.880]  to to kind of um...
[02:52:58.880 --> 02:53:00.400]  uh... couch
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:03.920]  on what uh... lindsay said i want to point out two other things
[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:08.080]  i was the guy that was going to get the uh... optical uh... stimulated
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:11.720]  luminescence to go through the x-ray scanners at the airport when i'm flying
[02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:13.640]  over i told you about that
[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:17.480]  well guess what they shut down all the x-ray scanners and i think what has to
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:20.280]  do with this with lindsay saying is that they're trying to put kate the
[02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:22.640]  american public for the time being
[02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:26.800]  so they're now kind of you know that's right i talk to some airline pilots
[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:28.240]  uh...
[02:53:28.240 --> 02:53:31.440]  because somebody in hollywood flew a private jet editor picked me up and fly
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:33.040]  me out there a few weeks ago
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:36.280]  and i was talking to them because they also flew for uh... major airlines and
[02:53:36.280 --> 02:53:37.160]  they said look
[02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:40.280]  they've turned the scanners off at lax they're still off
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:43.600]  and and i'm hearing that most places they basically turned them off because
[02:53:43.600 --> 02:53:46.200]  they know it was sparing a rebellion
[02:53:46.200 --> 02:53:50.000]  but in austria and the vienna airport they have police dogs everywhere
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.640]  but in the former soviet union where we were
[02:53:52.640 --> 02:53:56.680]  they've heard nothing about our problems with the tsa or the x-ray uh...
[02:53:56.680 --> 02:54:00.600]  backscatter scanners and i got a job but i appreciate your call
[02:54:00.600 --> 02:54:04.360]  uh... yeah the the controllers don't want to give us an issue we can come
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:05.160]  together
[02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:08.680]  because liberals don't like the tsa conservatives don't like it
[02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:11.160]  they want to make everything left right so we fight with each other
[02:54:11.160 --> 02:54:14.440]  this was a perfect issue that i launched over a year ago seeing that it was the
[02:54:14.440 --> 02:54:15.480]  perfect issue
[02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:18.440]  to get people together and that's why they're backing off
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:21.600]  but i guess that's the good news lindsay if we have this information and get
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:22.360]  it out
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:24.720]  you know the globalist can be stopped
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:27.440]  they can and uh...
[02:54:27.440 --> 02:54:29.120]  which not too late
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:31.960]  they've that timeline is the end of twenty twelve
[02:54:31.960 --> 02:54:36.200]  we do have time and programs like yours alexa the only hope
[02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:38.800]  that we've got a getting this information out
[02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:43.840]  and it wouldn't be able to know the issues they they know the entire picture
[02:54:43.840 --> 02:54:47.600]  then they could do something about it you must take care of certain things in
[02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:50.560]  your household immediately
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:53.600]  now we're gonna do a final segment coming up here we got five minutes left to
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:56.720]  take calls and five more minutes but i want to just point out people do want to
[02:54:56.720 --> 02:55:00.280]  get pre-ordered that dvd should be done the next week to see it all in one place
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:01.080]  without
[02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:04.400]  new news breaks and my interruptions and calls and things
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:07.080]  uh... though this is interesting and informative as well you can go to
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:08.640]  prophecyclub dot com
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:10.080]  and uh... pre-order
[02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:14.160]  and the name of the new production breaking this down is lindsay williams
[02:55:14.160 --> 02:55:16.520]  the middle east the rest of the story will give you the number
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:18.320]  coming up in the final segment
[02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:21.480]  uh... but right now uh... let's go ahead and go back to the calls as
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:22.280]  promised
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:26.000]  delta in new jersey delta you're on the air
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.400]  by alex
[02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:33.720]  so uh... question is uh... in the same typical uh... playbook that they
[02:55:33.720 --> 02:55:38.400]  create the chaos and they play both sides
[02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:41.160]  you know create their order out of chaos are there any
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:45.280]  besides the middle east to date plan on
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:48.600]  here in the u l absolutely they're going to bring in economic things they're
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:52.160]  going to cause turmoil here that's why they got the police state in place
[02:55:52.160 --> 02:55:55.320]  as the solution because when people riot and burn stuff up
[02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:58.360]  that makes the economy get worse than the globalists get to buy it up for
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:02.560]  pennies in the dollar and then be the heroes rolling out their federal police
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:03.600]  and the rest of it
[02:56:03.600 --> 02:56:06.520]  as lindsay said the globalist like to buy things
[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:09.120]  when they're rock bottom prices lindsay
[02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:12.480]  yes everything you've just said it's true i haven't even had time to get into
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:14.080]  this part of it all but
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:16.800]  what you're going to see in the middle east is you're going to see a repeat of
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:19.280]  Egypt you're going to see a repeat of libya
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:23.960]  all over the middle east one of the last ones will be Saudi Arabia
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:27.280]  and no telling what will happen there at that point you're going to see the
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:28.960]  crude oil prices now
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:35.280]  it will spread to america we just had a very very small idea of this in
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:37.240]  wisconsin this past week
[02:56:37.240 --> 02:56:41.680]  i know nothing about whether that was incited or not i do not think it was
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:43.360]  but you'll see a repeat
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:45.880]  of problems across america
[02:56:45.880 --> 02:56:49.400]  just as you're going to see in the middle east well they're shutting down half the
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:50.320]  schools
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:53.920]  in detroit many cities are laying off more than half their police and sheriffs
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:58.000]  deputies and we haven't even begun to get into this depression yet
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:01.640]  that's exactly right it is going to spread to america from over there folks
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:03.160]  please be prepared
[02:57:03.160 --> 02:57:05.800]  you definitely need to do everything that you're going to do and do it
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:07.520]  immediately
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:11.240]  i don't know how to say anymore alex accepted yes what's in the middle east
[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:14.240]  will spread to america except in a different all right let's jam in one
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:18.160]  more call before this hour as we're going to come back i let's talk to a
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:20.840]  to fred in ohio fred you're on the air
[02:57:20.840 --> 02:57:22.880]  yes uh... good afternoon
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:26.280]  but since we know that we've been double-crossed and a-rabs know they've
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:27.720]  been double-crossed
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:32.200]  and we've got a twenty five million dollar bounty on ben laden and others
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:35.200]  why haven't these dictators and kings and a-rabs
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  put bounties on the elitists
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:39.760]  that have done all of this to us
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:42.520]  well because then in military would invite him overnight
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:46.040]  the globalists are very aware of that danger of people striking back that's
[02:57:46.040 --> 02:57:47.800]  why when saddam hussein
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:50.360]  you know talked about going after george herbert walker bush you saw what
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:51.120]  happened
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:54.360]  it's because they know the globalist run our country the nuclear weapons the
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:55.720]  assassination teams
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:57:59.200]  i think you answered your own question and i'm not calling for violence that's
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:57:59.960]  a game
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:03.480]  the globalist with all their security in the rest of it want to play they want
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:04.480]  us to get violent
[02:58:04.480 --> 02:58:07.440]  so they have an excuse to crack down they're spurring the violence in the
[02:58:07.440 --> 02:58:10.800]  middle east all you guys that call for violence constantly
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:13.200]  and tell me i'm a wimp because i don't do it
[02:58:13.200 --> 02:58:16.120]  you know and then they always do it with with uh... anonymity i'm not saying
[02:58:16.120 --> 02:58:17.600]  fred's bad i'm saying people that
[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:20.000]  alex you want to call for an uprising you wanna
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:23.960]  run out and start shooting people and they're doing it on message boards
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:26.720]  and if they're not feds they should worry because i've seen folks that aren't
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:28.200]  feds go to jail for that
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:29.800]  uh... i'm here to get the word out

[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:09.440]  violence
[03:01:09.440 --> 03:01:10.960]  all positively
[03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:13.560]  what you're seeing happen right now in libya
[03:01:13.560 --> 03:01:17.200]  i'm sure you must have heard even on the national news this morning
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:19.600]  from airplanes they're shooting
[03:01:19.600 --> 03:01:21.000]  at civilians
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.360]  uh... kadafi says i positively will not step down under any circumstances
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:26.480]  whatsoever
[03:01:26.480 --> 03:01:29.400]  as a result all prices went up so much this morning
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:32.960]  libya sells one point six million barrels of day
