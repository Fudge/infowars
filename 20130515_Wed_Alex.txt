[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  You're listening to GCN, the world leader in independent talk radio.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[00:17.000 --> 00:19.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  Strap yourselves in, my friends.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  It is already Wednesday, the 15th day of May, 2013.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  Hard to believe we're almost halfway into 2013.
[00:50.000 --> 00:52.000]  Halfway into the rest of our lives.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  It is an adventure, and there is no turning back.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  So embrace it, live it with gusto, and leave your mark for liberty and freedom and constructive development for human society.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  That's what marks a human being from a globalist animal who is out of control, operating as a cancer on the face of this globe.
[01:13.000 --> 01:35.000]  Well, it's information overload as the quickening accelerates, as more and more happens across the world, and as the absurdist whitewashing of the corporatist press and of the White House intensifies, trying to make excuses for the manifest lying that's going on.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  And there's a Hill article, you know, talking about the fact of why is the press all starting to turn against Obama?
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's because they realize that they have no relevance if they don't.
[01:50.000 --> 02:02.000]  They already realize they've lost relevance, and the article goes into how Drudge is able to focus on the White House corruption, and so the media then follows that.
[02:02.000 --> 02:13.000]  What Drudge is able to do, what Infowars is able to do, what any other real media is able to do, is show you what they said a month ago versus what they're saying now.
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.000]  And then we'll show you what they say tomorrow in context right next to each other.
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  The headline is, Obama needs a Drudge.
[02:27.000 --> 02:41.000]  But Obama doesn't want a Drudge because Drudge is showing how Obama changes his story and gets caught lying every day.
[02:42.000 --> 02:55.000]  It's like a time capsule or something, and all they do at Drudge and all we do at Infowars and all you do out there in your own life is have a memory and go, wait a minute.
[02:55.000 --> 03:04.000]  They admitted they were going after libertarian and conservative tax-free groups three years ago.
[03:05.000 --> 03:21.000]  They've had MSNBC call for a purge, but now America, because of all the other Benghazi gates and everything else, and breaking into the media and spying on the media and persecuting whistle-blowers,
[03:21.000 --> 03:27.000]  now the public is ready to see it in the light for which it really is out of control.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  Extremely dangerous, authoritarian.
[03:31.000 --> 03:41.000]  So that is just some of the news that we are going to be covering and going over today.
[03:41.000 --> 03:54.000]  And Infowars.com has been having intermittent issues. A few weeks ago we were being hacked or attacked different ways, and right now we can punch it up on screen.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  We need to let IT know. They probably never will. I'm being sarcastic.
[03:59.000 --> 04:07.000]  Service unavailable. This server temporarily unable to service your request due to maintenance downtime or capacity problems. Please try again later.
[04:07.000 --> 04:16.000]  So you will need to go to DrudgeReport.com to find a lot of the stories I'm going to be covering, obviously.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  Look at this headline. What are these weird street signs being installed in Las Vegas?
[04:22.000 --> 04:31.000]  And they look just like the Intellistreets designs that Homeland Security is spending billions of dollars on where streetlights and power poles become surveillance grids.
[04:31.000 --> 04:41.000]  And then they also give the public orders and in the future of these companies, or several, admit you'll waive your ID card in front of it or stand for a face scan.
[04:42.000 --> 04:47.000]  And what they do is they bark orders demanding you line up in front of the computer or a SWAT team is coming.
[04:48.000 --> 04:55.000]  I'm not joking. And there's also a video of people out in California. The cops come to the door, the kids are playing in the yard.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  They go, we're going to come in and make sure there's no disturbance. They say there is no disturbance.
[04:59.000 --> 05:06.000]  So the cops bust in and then taser both the man and woman who are doing nothing as punishment.
[05:07.000 --> 05:19.000]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[05:19.000 --> 05:32.000]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective, and perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[05:40.000 --> 05:49.000]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter. It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.000]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune system support.

[06:07.000 --> 06:11.000]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[06:22.000 --> 06:25.000]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[06:26.000 --> 06:27.000]  The fact is you are. We all are.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[06:30.000 --> 06:38.000]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoods Direct.
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from eFoods Direct.
[06:51.000 --> 06:58.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or visit them on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex and check out their spring specials.
[06:58.000 --> 07:04.000]  Again, that number is 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  Check out Simply Safe. It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  Go to GetSimplySafe.com.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  Simply Safe is independent and off the grid.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.

[07:44.000 --> 07:45.000]  GetSimplySafe.com.
[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  Simply Safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes.

[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[08:13.000 --> 08:32.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host, Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:35.000 --> 08:44.000]  It is the 15th day of May 2013, and I'm going to open the phones up throughout the three hours today.
[08:45.000 --> 08:57.000]  Dr. Corey Gold's talk show host in his own right is going to be joining us to give us his take on Benghazi gate, IRS gate, media spying, persecution gate, whatever you want to call it.
[08:58.000 --> 08:59.000]  What is behind all this and where is it going?
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  There's now talk, which is good.
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  That's where it should be going by Boehner of all people.
[09:05.000 --> 09:21.000]  The Speaker of the House to go after Obama or people in his party, in his criminal government with criminal charges.
[09:22.000 --> 09:24.000]  They're talking about who is going to go to jail.
[09:24.000 --> 09:31.000]  Someone needs to go to jail and national polls are out showing the majority of Americans want jail time for these criminals as well.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  We have footage up on Infowars.com about in California.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  The police come and say we heard there's a report of loud voices.
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  And the family says, well, nothing's going on here.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  Kids are playing in the yard. We don't need any help.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  The cops say we're going to come in.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  You're going to get on the floor.
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  And they say, no, you need a warrant for that.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  And that's what the courts have ruled.
[09:56.000 --> 10:01.000]  And they kick the door down and the people have their hands up and they both taser them as punishment.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  We're going to play that video and audio later.
[10:06.000 --> 10:14.000]  And then there's new footage up on Infowars.com of a reporter who went to an area northwest of London to actually visit a friend.
[10:14.000 --> 10:22.000]  And while he was at it, thought, well, nearby is the Grove Hotel where Bilderberg is going to be meeting in a few weeks.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  Google is already set to meet there next week.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  And a helicopter came over and then police.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  First he's like, oh, is that helicopter hovering over me for them as I walk down a country road just wanting to videotape a golf course?
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  And then police show up and say, we've got to put you basically in a database.
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.000]  Give us your info. Why are you here?
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  And secret police all over the place.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  And this is the essence of secret police where they just say, hi, we're here to look into what you're doing.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  We're here to put you in a database.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  We're here to make you answer questions.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  And you say, well, I'm not going to answer your questions.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  Well, we're going to beat you up and say that you said that you resisted us.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.000]  It doesn't matter if it's on tape.
[11:07.000 --> 11:08.000]  They have kept juries that will put you in jail.
[11:08.000 --> 11:13.000]  We have the biggest prison population in the world here in the U.S. and it's only getting worse.
[11:14.000 --> 11:23.000]  And the system wants the police to act in a thuggish way against the public and train us that we're all criminals when the real criminals in government are above the law.
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  And again, I'm not saying all police are bad.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  Most police are actually good people that sign up for the real reasons.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  But the thugs, the bullies are being promoted to the top and they are protecting the thugs.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  And there's a conversion over to the way police forces are in North Korea or Mexico.
[11:42.000 --> 11:52.000]  Now, that said, we reported last year on Intellistreets and other companies getting Homeland Security grants to put microphones in cameras and face scanning cameras.
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  And New York's already putting these up in systems that scan through your clothes, quote, looking for weapons.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  So again, guilty until proven innocent, piercing your clothes, violating the Fourth Amendment.
[12:03.000 --> 12:10.000]  Because your person, you know, the clothing over you is your privacy, is your privacy.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  It's very, very simple.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  And we need your help up on Infowars.com with an article that we've got posted.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  What are these weird street signs being put up all over Las Vegas?
[12:27.000 --> 12:36.000]  And you look at them, they have the symbol of a badge on them with computer screens above, in the center and below.
[12:37.000 --> 12:44.000]  And they then have wiring going up to what looks like little command pods on the top of them.
[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  These are clearly police communication hub slash spy grids.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  But we need to identify exactly what company it is.
[12:53.000 --> 13:00.000]  The folks that sent us these images, I wish they would have gone to the back of the panels and looked for the stamp of manufacture.
[13:01.000 --> 13:09.000]  Because that would let us know. This is definitely some type of, you know, Google type wireless grabbing spy pod command pod.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Because we can see the communications arrays.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  But it's also clearly there to give orders and commands to the public.
[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  A decade ago in England, they put up as the test ground thousands of telescreens that actually bark orders at you.
[13:25.000 --> 13:35.000]  And that it has a computer with sent messages, but then also the police can come over it and demand as it barks orders.
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  There's the headline, talking surveillance cameras coming to US streets.
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.000]  That's May 14th, 2012, almost exactly a year ago.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  Wow. Talking surveillance cameras coming to US streets.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  IntelliStreet system now being installed with DHS backing.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  And it looks like the IntelliStreet or one of the other companies, but we need to confirm that.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  That indeed these are going in.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  And then it tells you, presents yourself, show ID, the new IDs, and we have the RFID chips in them in every state.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  And then you present yourself via the digital photo of your driver's license and it scans you.
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  It takes a digital photo and that's the new system where you're walking and it goes, stand up straight up against the wall.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  Don't introduce a will respond in police presence.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  And the cops pull up. They're like, why didn't you stop back there? Well, I'm going somewhere.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  All right, buddy, up against the wall.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  Hey, welcome to America.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  And by the way, we have video this happening more and more, and then they'll beat somebody to death.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  And if you videotape it, they'll beat you to death or they'll put you in jail.
[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  Even when the footage comes out, I mean, they'll put a guy in handcuffs, shoot him right in the back and then grab everybody's video cameras.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  I mean, you've seen those cases.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  This is all a giant control grid for us where we are the hunted.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  And again, oh, it's going to stop crime.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  The government runs the motorcycle gangs, runs the gangs, runs the drugs, launders the money.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  They run the child kidnapping, all of it.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  All of it. I mean, look it up.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  Help me. Homeless man begs as cops fatally beat him in videotaped incident.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  Now, that was one of the famous ones out in California.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  It was just another one where they grabbed everybody's video tapes, all their phones.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  Took people to jail, you name it.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  And I think that's good. I think anybody videotaping police should be executed.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  By the way, I've got some articles. I'm going to get to make sarcastic, folks.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  I've got some articles. Are Austin police shootings a growing trend? K.I.
[15:33.000 --> 15:34.000]  A growing trend? They are way up.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  And I've said we've got a better department here in Austin than the many cities I've been to.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  But still, I mean, look at the benchmark we're at.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Like, yeah, OK, Austin police are a lot better than North Korea.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  They're a lot better than New York police.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  But I don't want to become that.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  Exclusive. Shootings by Philly police soar as violent crime plummets.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  Philly dot com. Philadelphia Inquirer.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  And it goes through how they just pull people over and just shoot them.
[16:03.000 --> 16:04.000]  And that's the same thing happening in Austin.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  They pulled a guy over.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  And he got out, didn't do anything.
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.000]  And then they started shooting at him.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  Because he reportedly put his cell phone in his pocket.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  You know, you get out of the car, you get your cell phone. All right.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Oh, boom, boom.
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  And because they're so afraid, because they all go watch Olympus has fallen.
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.000]  They all go watch these movies and they really believe that there are people trying to kill them everywhere.
[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  As the violent crime rate has dropped forty nine percent.
[16:32.000 --> 16:33.000]  I've been reporting this for months.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  The Justice Department finally put out a full report on it.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  The L.A. Times. Here's the L.A. Times headline.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Gun crime has plunged, but Americans think it's up.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  Study says. And it's cops as well.
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.000]  I mean, if you talk to a cop now, like you'll see a cop walking down the street like, hey, how's it going?
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  They're like. Why are you talking to me?
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  I mean, it's fear because, you know, they go watch 24 and they watch all these cop shows.
[16:58.000 --> 17:01.000]  And it's not just the cops, it's the general public.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  They literally believe terrorists are everywhere.
[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  Of course, I've seen the numbers. It varies year to year.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  But usually in an average year, you're about 13, 14 times.
[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  You can look this up, folks.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  You're more likely to die as a police officer in a car wreck or being run over by a driver.
[17:20.000 --> 17:22.000]  And cops know this. We really think about it.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  Then you are to be shot.
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  Then you are to be shot.
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  And it's just the wicked flee when none pursue.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  And if you're not wicked, that message isn't for you.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  But I just don't get it.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  I mean, this isn't real. The video games aren't real.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.000]  The TV shows aren't real.
[17:40.000 --> 17:45.000]  There aren't really terrorists except for ones that globalists manufacture 99 percent of the time.
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.000]  I have found real terror attacks that have happened in the Middle East where it's asymmetrical warfare, where people fight.
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  It's just war. But to demonize somebody you're in a war with, I'm not taking sides here, I'm just saying they're really asymmetrical.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  There is asymmetrical combat that goes on, and that is called terrorism.
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  Now, when the West funds al-Qaeda to attack Libya and Syria and engage in, we look at the number.
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  120,000 dead, most of them civilians, by al-Qaeda.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  120,000 dead in the last two years in Syria and growing.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  Lining the Alawite minority up, killing them, killing Christians, Jews, and it's called a protest.
[18:24.000 --> 18:31.000]  When they attacked the ambassador over the six to eight hours in Libya, it was called a protest.
[18:31.000 --> 18:39.000]  So real terrorists are called protesters, and there it is, Syrian death toll likely as high as 120,000, group says.
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.000]  That is from just yesterday out of the Huffington Post, but I think it's an AP article in Huffington Post.
[18:48.000 --> 18:53.000]  The point is, is that, see, I'm glad you pulled that up, guys, people don't think I'm making this stuff up.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  People just get amazed, I can rattle off statistics.
[18:56.000 --> 19:06.000]  You can rattle off baseball scores, but you can't rattle off 69% drop in wounding fatalities, I mean, in a wounding.
[19:07.000 --> 19:15.000]  39% in shooting fatality drops, and 49% overall violent crime rate drop since 1992.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  Look it up, I covered this last week, it's LA Times now.
[19:20.000 --> 19:28.000]  We've been telling you this since these statistics came out a few months ago, but now here it is, mainstream news, mainstream news.
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  So that's just some of the videos and some of the articles that are up on infoawars.com right now.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  Shock video, California police break into home, tase victims, and the people are like, calm.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  They're like, okay, you just broke in our house, nothing's going on.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  People have their hands up, like good victims, and the cops taser them both.
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  And people are even on my website defending it, going, well, we don't know what was going on in there.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  Hey, everybody, they show up at your house, hands up, come out, we're going to search your home without a warrant.
[20:01.000 --> 20:02.000]  It's the new America.
[20:03.000 --> 20:05.000]  And it's all getting you ready to take your bank accounts.
[20:06.000 --> 20:07.000]  So don't worry, cops, you're going to get it too.

[20:47.000 --> 20:53.000]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[23:58.000 --> 24:07.000]  MyPatriotSupply.com. MyPatriotSupply.com.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  The reading list and private thoughts of Tea Party groups they were harassing and auditing.
[24:34.000 --> 24:41.000]  You see, they're turning the census into a yearly and then monthly government interrogation with threats of arrest
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  if you don't violate your own Fifth Amendment and waive your rights as well as your Fourth Amendment.
[24:46.000 --> 24:53.000]  They are turning the IRS into something that runs your healthcare and spies on you and enforces everything and is a political control arm.
[24:53.000 --> 25:02.000]  They're taking all these federal agencies and they're metastasizing right now as the country is bankrupted by design.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  Obama campaign co-chair attacked Romney with leaked docs. No kidding.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  IRS approved liberal groups with Tea Party in limbo. GOP impeachment not off the table.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  Prominent Catholic professor claims IRS audited her after speaking out against Obama. Absolutely.
[25:19.000 --> 25:28.000]  This is all part of the intimidation. Demand to know who was paying for her.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  IRS asked for Facebook post. Demanded list of students that were part of libertarian and conservative groups.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  This is what a free country does? Well, they're just making sure.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  IRS wants you to share everything. Politico reports.
[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  And again, they're hoping to just bring all this out and normalize it.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  And so many people I talk to now go, you're absolutely right about this, but I better not visit info wars dot com.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  I better not speak out. They'll get me. No, if you give in to the fear, they will get everyone.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  This is what an authoritarian normalization looks like.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  I mean, it's like sheriffs in Palm Beach County.
[26:10.000 --> 26:22.000]  The sheriff comes out and says, if anyone criticizes the government, call us and we'll drop by to see what they're up to and have a nice little talk with them.
[26:23.000 --> 26:31.000]  What they'll do is force their way in your house without a warrant, grab you for a forced psychological evaluation by one of their hired psychiatrist or psychologist and take your guns.
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  And there'll be no judge, no jury. You will now be listed as a mental patient in their fake database.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  People go, well, the sheriff also said if somebody talks about shooting the mayor.
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  Now, what they say is if someone says they don't like the government or that they're angry at the government or they want to shoot the mayor.
[26:48.000 --> 26:57.000]  It's like if somebody says they want the Constitution and to kill their kids, see, they they add that into it to demonize the earlier point.
[26:57.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's all semantical con games with these people. And now all over the country, they're putting up microphones and cameras and and and telescreens and and and and telling you how they're going to prosecute you for this and prosecute for that.
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.000]  And we're watching you and you can't be trusted and you better do what the government says and you better.
[27:18.000 --> 27:30.000]  And oh, there's. There's all sorts of rulings like town hall reporting court rules against German homeschooling family seeking asylum who face prison time for homeschooling their children.
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  And Obama is turning the family back, who's been here for three years from asylum.
[27:37.000 --> 27:45.000]  Oh, if you are if you're running from North Korea or you're running from stuff in Germany, which is an incredible police state now on many fronts, you're not allowed to get away.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  Oh, you're going to stay there because they want to make America like Germany is.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  They're trying to ban homeschooling. California a few years ago tried to ban it, but it got defeated in court.
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.000]  And they said in the court argument at the state level, I remember reading the the filing, they said the state has jurisdiction over your children and they are the primary guardians.
[28:07.000 --> 28:17.000]  And then now MSNBC in promo says the community, the state is the parents, not you. Your children are not yours.
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  We need to get over this idea that your children are yours.
[28:22.000 --> 28:34.000]  And I'm glad you're upset out there. You know, I tell my entire crew who sits in there and gets upset about all this and they watch the videos, we're getting ready to play and they get upset and they say something's got to be done and they're all in there talking angry.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  And I looked at them all and I said, hey, everywhere I walk around in this office, people are in the coffee room, wherever looking at articles discussing it.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  And I'm glad I've got a crew that cares about this information. I'm glad I've got a crew that works so hard.
[28:47.000 --> 28:57.000]  I'm glad I've got a crew that is upset. But I say this, don't just sit around at your office or don't just sit around at church or wherever and talk with a few friends about how you're upset about what's going on.
[28:57.000 --> 29:08.000]  Go to the city council, go to the county commissioners, let them know that you're the boss and they're the servant. Set up your own YouTube channel, do your own radio podcast, go do your own YouTube channel.
[29:09.000 --> 29:21.000]  Because I've told particular people in this office that are constantly walking around talking to everybody else, everybody goes to them to talk about the New World Order and I'm like, when do all these great ideas get on air?
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  When do all these discussions fight the New World Order? When are you going to put that on air? Put that on air.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  Because let me tell you something, it's the time for sitting around with people you know are already awake and talking about this is over.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  It's time to hit the bricks. It's time to get on the street. It's time to get on the air.
[29:40.000 --> 29:50.000]  And I don't, even if you reach 100 people a week on YouTube, it'll grow into tens of thousands. Even if you get a local radio show, Access TV, use a venue. Get out there.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  You are the resistance. You are the hope. You are the leaders. You're the soldiers we need.
[29:57.000 --> 30:06.000]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[32:06.000 --> 32:32.000]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[32:32.000 --> 32:46.000]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Younggevity. The Younggevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[33:07.000 --> 33:25.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:25.000 --> 33:36.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time, we're here live. Back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central.
[33:37.000 --> 33:41.000]  By the way, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you're not fighting the prison planet.
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  Everything I do, everything I try to do is about getting people off their butts in action in the fight for liberty worldwide.
[33:48.000 --> 33:59.000]  It's an intellectual, cultural, ongoing, ancient battle. All of our ancestors, no matter where you come from in the world, were involved either on the side of tyranny or the side of liberty.
[34:00.000 --> 34:09.000]  And I'm asking you to be involved in the side of liberty right now against these control freaks and a PrisonPlanet.tv membership is $5.95 a month.
[34:09.000 --> 34:18.000]  That pays for the bandwidth and the cameras, the crew and things, or at least it pays for part of it. And then our mission is to get more people to tune in and wake up.
[34:19.000 --> 34:26.000]  You can have 11 people watch simultaneously, any time of day, with one PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[34:26.000 --> 34:38.000]  12 different people technically can tune in because I actually had them turn it up to 12. I haven't announced that yet. I just announced it right then.
[34:39.000 --> 34:48.000]  But what's happening is most people don't use it all the time, so you can have 30 or 40 people using it.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  And then if you try to go log in and you're locked out, that's good news. It means you shared your username and passcode.
[34:54.000 --> 35:02.000]  The unique code you create for PrisonPlanet.tv that you can share, and that means people have now gone and used it so much that you're not able to log in.
[35:03.000 --> 35:11.000]  Then the answer is go get another $5.95 membership and share that with others. We call it Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant.
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.000]  So if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, the site just gets better and better. It's been up for over 10 years now.

[37:12.000 --> 37:18.000]  Again, I want to give first-time callers a chance to get involved on air today. 800-259-9231.
[37:18.000 --> 37:28.000]  Now, let me run over the latest on the changing stories, the lies, and the good news that because of grassroots pressure,
[37:29.000 --> 37:36.000]  Boehner, who's been an insider and always whitewashing things, is being forced to talk about people need to be arrested, people need to go to jail.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  The problem is then those people will squeal like Fast and Furious when they're facing jail time and say,
[37:42.000 --> 37:47.000]  I was ordered to by the Attorney General and by the head of Homeland Security, Mr. Napolitano.
[37:48.000 --> 37:54.000]  Well, of course you were. Of course you were. Of course you were ordered to.
[37:55.000 --> 38:05.000]  And this is their Waterloo. This is their Watergate. To continue the water analogies here, we have to continue to hammer this.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  Let's go over some of these headlines here.
[38:08.000 --> 38:20.000]  Justice Department defends seizure of phone records. So they're now defending that while saying they didn't know it was going on that underlings did it.
[38:21.000 --> 38:28.000]  But they're now changing that story. That's the New York Times. Holder isn't sure how often reporters' records are seized.
[38:29.000 --> 38:36.000]  Just amazing, ladies and gentlemen. And again, they're already spying illegally on everything. We've confirmed that.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  Just from our whistleblowers with them finding out who they are almost instantly.
[38:41.000 --> 38:53.000]  I mean, you literally have to meet people in parking lots. Or folks mail us stuff from mailboxes with fake return addresses and then we call the phone numbers on it and confirm their real documents.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  That's really the way the old-fashioned Manila envelope lay.
[38:58.000 --> 39:08.000]  Continuing, Eric Holder points finger at deputy who secretly obtained journalists' phone records as Obama is forced to say he has confidence in the Attorney General.
[39:09.000 --> 39:16.000]  So we're going to have the Attorney General of Fast and Furious and the Oklahoma City cover-up that came out in court.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  He ran that cover-up of what really went on there. These are very nice people, folks.
[39:21.000 --> 39:33.000]  And now they know nothing. But they're defending it. Continuing here with the news on the media being harassed front.
[39:34.000 --> 39:41.000]  Holder defaced Capitol Hill grilling today. We're going to follow that. That's out of the Hill newspaper. They report on that front.
[39:41.000 --> 39:50.000]  Also, there's another headline here that White House on AP probe, Obama firm believer in press freedom.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  Well, thank goodness Kim Jong-un is a firm believer. I mean, Obama. Everything's fine now.
[39:57.000 --> 40:08.000]  Newsmax reporting. Again, what I just mentioned, the Justice Department to investigate not only the harassment of whistleblowers and the going after phone records of sources.
[40:08.000 --> 40:18.000]  Reporting on criminal activities by this government. A crime syndicate trying to protect itself. Now, Justice to investigate IRS targeting of the Tea Party.
[40:19.000 --> 40:28.000]  And again, there's a Hill article out going Obama needs his own drudge to be able to counter everybody getting on the bandwagon to attack him.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  It's because the media are a bunch of cowards. Just like the Boston bombing, our reporter goes and says,
[40:34.000 --> 40:41.000]  Who are these other guys? You admit you had a drill. You don't want to talk about it. Why was there a stand down? Here are photos of the other people.
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  And the FBI guy was literally completely scared and goes, Do not listen to him. Do not talk to him. Do not look at his photos.
[40:50.000 --> 40:57.000]  And none of the press covered it or looked at the photos. Instead, they demonized us and said, How dare they ask?
[40:57.000 --> 41:11.000]  How dare info wars ask about a drill? Yeah, I mean, it looks like you got about 50 security people in black backpacks and black shirts and tan pants and boots.
[41:12.000 --> 41:19.000]  Staring right where the bomb goes off, disappearing minutes before it goes off, and then running around with radiation detectors and stuff.
[41:19.000 --> 41:31.000]  Let's just not even discuss that. And let's not discuss all these other suspects. And let's not discuss Saudi Arabians on no no fly list and stuff being visited by the first lady and visiting the White House eight times or whatever.
[41:32.000 --> 41:38.000]  Let's just not discuss that, because it's a conspiracy theory that they're spying on the media now confirmed. It's a conspiracy theory.
[41:39.000 --> 41:45.000]  They bought two billion bullets now confirmed. Now it's a conspiracy that I don't like that they bought that and that I'm suspicious of it.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.000]  First, it wasn't happening. Now, now it's I'm bad because I was right.
[41:50.000 --> 41:57.000]  Here it is. Justice to investigate IRS targeting of Tea Party. Isn't that just special?
[41:58.000 --> 42:08.000]  So they'll get to the bottom of it. Don't you worry your little your little boots about that. The very people doing this will investigate it.
[42:08.000 --> 42:16.000]  They call that Fox guarding the henhouse in my day. But nowadays, that's a conspiracy theory. If you can two plus two equals four is a conspiracy theory.
[42:17.000 --> 42:28.000]  Knowing how to tie your shoelaces is a conspiracy theory. When, whether it's the US or England, we have videos out today when you say you don't have a right to stop me randomly and ask me questions.
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  I'm walking down the sidewalk by a park. Is this part of an ongoing investigation? No, it's not. Then no, you don't have a right.
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.000]  And they go, oh, why are you a conspiracy theorist? That's what TSA does now when they want to take you over and grope you.
[42:42.000 --> 42:48.000]  And you're like, you know, the government got the underwear bomber on the plane. This doesn't protect us from terrorism. This violates my Fourth Amendment.
[42:49.000 --> 42:56.000]  They're on record on video after video we posted with other citizens and journalists going, that's enough of your conspiracy theories.
[42:56.000 --> 43:05.000]  And I've talked about this, having free will, having an opinion, having a view is a conspiracy theory.
[43:06.000 --> 43:15.000]  Sitting down, shutting up, taking all your vaccines, getting Parkinson's disease early, getting cancer early, eating your GMO, dying like the rats on record.
[43:15.000 --> 43:29.000]  That's a good citizen. And, you know, I see these videos of these cops all over the country, but also in Europe, when they come over and get in journalist's faces for no reason, they have this crazed enjoyment.
[43:30.000 --> 43:39.000]  And they're always like caressing their uniform and caressing, just enjoying it. I'm in an outfit. I'm in a suit. I'm in a costume.
[43:39.000 --> 43:48.000]  And I was watching video of these British cops and it's an attractive female cop. And you could tell a woman's jacked up, really excited.
[43:49.000 --> 43:57.000]  And she's just getting off on the power over this guy and just rubbing on the seat belt and rubbing on her uniform.
[43:58.000 --> 44:06.000]  And I mean, it's just like she's all excited. It's all about how she's got power. I mean, these are not people that need power, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:06.000 --> 44:14.000]  I mean, who wants to act like this? Idiots, that's who. People that would never have had real power in the world.
[44:15.000 --> 44:29.000]  Real power because they had power. In ancient times, if you could fight, you could hunt, you could plant crops better, you could tell the weather better, you could strategize how to defend the tribe better, you went to the top, it made humans stronger.
[44:29.000 --> 44:37.000]  Now, if you get in line and enjoy getting your power out of a corrupt system, not out of who you are, you go to the top.
[44:38.000 --> 44:45.000]  And that's why society is turning to North Korea. And pretty soon you can't even plant crops, you can't make automobiles, your cities don't have electricity anymore.
[44:45.000 --> 45:04.000]  But the upper class are all on uniforms with that same look in their eye of enjoyment and that same, I've been to Mexico, I've seen videos and footage out of North Korea, you've all seen it, and I see the same look in our cops now more and more of just the satisfaction.
[45:04.000 --> 45:22.000]  It's the same satisfaction when my daughters were three or four and would dress up like princesses and run around enjoying themselves with plastic rings on, you know, costume jewelry, having fun when their friends would come over, and it's cute when a three-year-old girl is on a power trip imagining they're a queen.
[45:22.000 --> 45:34.000]  It is not good when you're a 35-year-old cop acting like that. It is good when you're a three-year-old boy playing cops and robbers out in the yard to imagine you're a superhero.
[45:35.000 --> 45:39.000]  You've got to imagine you're going to be a powerful male and a warrior before you actually become one.
[45:39.000 --> 46:05.000]  But being a warrior who battles the journalist isn't a warrior. It's called being a North Korean thug. And look, I salute the police that do a good job out there in some of the crime-ridden areas, but more and more, once crime takes over, the police just become criminal because there's corrupt cops above them on the take, and then you collapse like Detroit or Chicago.
[46:05.000 --> 46:18.000]  I mean, these are now third-world areas with a lot of great people in them. I'm not bashing your cities, but they're all now fleeing here and then now trying to put me under their way of life.
[46:19.000 --> 46:31.000]  And I'm sorry. My ancestors went to war with people that tried to make them slaves. And come hell or high water, didn't back down. And that's just where I come from. That's who I am.
[46:31.000 --> 46:40.000]  I have an instinct to not be a slave. I have an instinct to want to be free. I have an instinct to disdain thugs.
[46:41.000 --> 46:52.000]  Gangs wear their uniforms. Motorcycle gangs wear their uniforms. Cops wear their uniforms. This is all ancient crud. And I'm done with it.
[46:52.000 --> 47:03.000]  And listen, do all of you think you're on a winning team, caressing your uniforms, getting off on fetishizing it? Let me tell you folks, you're dead already. You've all been injected with cancer viruses.
[47:04.000 --> 47:13.000]  You're all drinking sodium fluoride. You're eating GMO. You're going to watch your kids die young. See, because it's going to kill you 20, 30 years young. It's going to kill your kids.
[47:13.000 --> 47:24.000]  A lot of you cops are like 50 right now. Your 25-year-old son's dying right now. Your daughter, your 20-year-old daughter, your 18-year-old daughter, your 10-year-old son's dying right now and you're crying right now.
[47:25.000 --> 47:37.000]  You know, the neighbors die of cancer too. You're going, my God, it's true. They're killing us. That's right, buddy. Why don't you come in and join the team and really wake up to the whole system instead of caressing your uniform all day?
[47:37.000 --> 47:50.000]  There's no amount of tickets you're going to write. They're going to keep the country from going bankrupt. There's nothing you can do, okay? The only thing you can do is realize we're all under scientific attack and really get with the program and let's figure out how to fix this.
[47:51.000 --> 48:00.000]  The media is starting to get with the program and realizing, why are we letting Obama persecute journalists? Why are we letting Obama run Al-Qaeda? Why are we letting them spy on everybody?
[48:00.000 --> 48:12.000]  Why are they harassing college groups that promote the Constitution? That's in the manual. Those that promote the Constitution, see, those that promote the Constitution are Americans and the good guys.
[48:13.000 --> 48:19.000]  And those that say the Constitution is bad and is terrorist, they're obviously the bad guys.
[48:19.000 --> 48:36.000]  800-25-99231, we're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment, but here it is. Justice Department to investigate IRS targeting of the G party. Well, I feel safe now. I feel safe.
[48:36.000 --> 48:53.000]  Progressive group, IRS gave us conservative groups confidential docs. And that's Newsmax, Breitbart, Rasmussen reports 57% want IRS offenders jailed or fired.
[48:53.000 --> 49:05.000]  Oh, but they're not talking, are they? Because they were ordered to do that. I mean, give me a break. The president's the one that orders that. Boehner on IRS, who's going to jail over the scandal? Washington Times.
[49:06.000 --> 49:16.000]  House Speaker John A. Boehner said today that it will take more than firings to clear up the IRS scandal. It'll take someone ending up serving jail time. Okay, I never praised Boehner.
[49:16.000 --> 49:26.000]  I'm going to praise him right now. That's that's what we need right there. Jail, long jail terms, long jail terms.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  Get rid of the IRS. It's a collection agency for the private Federal Reserve. The big bankers are all exempt from it.
[49:32.000 --> 49:42.000]  All you people that hate wealth and think you're winning team against people that produce by joining the Democratic Party and the socialists and the collectivists, the mega banks that fund you are tax exempt.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  They're offshore. They want to get rid of the middle class as a tool of economic domination.
[49:48.000 --> 49:56.000]  Because once you break the middle class forever, you now have an enslaved North Korean or Mexican population like in Mexico.
[49:57.000 --> 50:05.000]  The IRS wants you to share everything. I already mentioned this Politico article, but here they are going, well, what is the big deal? They want your reading list.
[50:05.000 --> 50:13.000]  I mean, of course, the government comes and says without a warrant, you will tell us your reading list or we're going to take all the money out of your bank account.
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.000]  It's like when I get the business census and the public sends me emails going, I don't get a business census. That's not real.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  Well, you must not run a business, dumb dumb. The community surveys and the business surveys are now yearly.
[50:26.000 --> 50:35.000]  And it asked me stocks, bonds, everything I do, total violation of Fourth and Fifth Amendment. And it says penalty of perjury.
[50:36.000 --> 50:42.000]  So if I make a mistake, by the way, then I'm going to jail for that. You know what? I'm not answering your questions. FBI shows up here.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  They put Martha Stewart in jail. They said for lying to them when she didn't.
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  She didn't insider trade. They just burned her because you know her name. Try to scare people.
[50:52.000 --> 50:57.000]  They sent her to jail for not knowing every bit of stock she had in a questionnaire.
[50:58.000 --> 51:03.000]  Well, I'm not answering any of your questions, you crooks, you narcotics trafficking, child kidnapping.
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  Yeah, that's who fences the little kids, most of them for snuff films, the government.
[51:08.000 --> 51:15.000]  With health threats on the rise, such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China,

[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  And when burglars think someone is home watching television, they're likely to pass your house and move on to an easier target.

[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[53:07.000 --> 53:16.000]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about. Threats that trample the American dream.
[53:17.000 --> 53:25.000]  You know what we all face. A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes. Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.

[54:22.000 --> 54:34.000]  If it keeps on raining the love is going to break. Going down, going down now, going down, down to Chicago.
[54:35.000 --> 54:42.000]  Here it comes again. We're just woodpecker-ing at the globalist.
[54:42.000 --> 54:52.000]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls. This segment next. We'll take calls in the next hour or two. Dr. Corey Gold's joining us to talk about Benghazi Gate, all of it.
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  I want to focus on Benghazi because we are getting distracted with the IRS stuff and all the rest of it.
[54:58.000 --> 55:04.000]  But look, folks, when I end the last segment saying the government runs child kidnapping rings, type in NATO and child sex trade.
[55:04.000 --> 55:14.000]  U.N. child sex trade, BBC, Reuters, AP, Chicago Tribune, where defense contractors, U.S. defense contractors, whistleblowers will say,
[55:15.000 --> 55:22.000]  I saw them load 125 children, some as young as two, onto the aircraft, flying them into Saudi Arabia, out of Bosnia.
[55:23.000 --> 55:30.000]  From there they were broken up and sent to other areas and then they have Italian investigations on TV where they're shooting three-year-olds in the head after they rape them.
[55:30.000 --> 55:40.000]  I mean, it's like, whoa. The government grabs little kids, rapes them and shoots them in the head with.357 magnums.
[55:41.000 --> 55:47.000]  And I know that there's all sorts of national media listening. Hey, do an article how I'm a liar.
[55:48.000 --> 55:55.000]  Go ahead, just like the, go ahead. And then we'll show you and then I'll go show a bunch of news articles showing everything I just said.
[55:55.000 --> 56:03.000]  The government, that's who you signed on, all the tough guy groups, all the gangsters, all the, there's always somebody worse than you.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  And they are who gets in the seat of power.
[56:10.000 --> 56:16.000]  And then society collapses. And I'm so sick of this culture glorifying criminals, glorifying so-called tough guys.
[56:16.000 --> 56:24.000]  You're all walking dead. You're all nobodies. Real men stand up for innocence. Real men stand up for justice.
[56:25.000 --> 56:33.000]  And it's time for real men to get aggressive out there. Somebody tries to push you around, somebody tries to peck you into submission, you get in their face.
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  Playing games with the New World Order is over. And all the criminal classes, you're going to push it too far and you know what's going to happen to all of you.
[56:41.000 --> 56:48.000]  You know what's going to happen. You're all going to be brought to justice.
[56:51.000 --> 56:59.000]  When we restore this republic, there's going to be Nuremberg trials. You're all going to get a jury trial and you're going to get hung by your neck until you're dead.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  And a lot of us aren't going to make it to that point to see it, but you will be brought to justice for what you've done to innocents.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  We will not be transported to a state of liberty on a bed of feathers.
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Simon in Florida. You're on the air, sir. Thanks for holding. You've got about a minute and a half.
[57:18.000 --> 57:24.000]  Okay, I just wanted to point out Aleister Stevenson. You've had several articles about him on your website.
[57:25.000 --> 57:32.000]  And I think it's important to point out also, if someone pulls up a picture of this family, this Richard family, look at the father.
[57:32.000 --> 57:39.000]  What specifically are you getting at, sir? We don't screen calls, but I've got to know what you're talking about.
[57:40.000 --> 57:46.000]  Very similar looking, the father, the Martin Richard kid that died, the eight-year-old in the Boston bombing.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.000]  Man, you know, I appreciate your call, but I mean, look, for folks that don't know what this guy's talking about, new listeners,
[57:54.000 --> 58:00.000]  there is this new belief that everybody's an actor and they do have crisis actors and they have staged fake events
[58:00.000 --> 58:04.000]  and they have used PR people to be there at events they stage to hype it.
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  But they killed real people at Sandy Hook and they killed real people at the Boston bombing.
[58:10.000 --> 58:18.000]  They like killing people, okay? Yes, they provocateur events, but they don't completely stage them. Those are very rare.
[58:18.000 --> 58:29.000]  And again, I mean, there's people that say that I'm all these different actors and people while I work in here 18 hours a day.
[58:30.000 --> 58:35.000]  I was at work 18 hours yesterday, actually more than 18 hours.
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  And of course it was enjoyable work hanging out with Mike Judge again for about five hours.
[58:40.000 --> 58:49.000]  I've got the best Mike Judge interview ever. We're going to be airing next week. It is bombshell.
[58:50.000 --> 58:57.000]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:58.000 --> 59:05.000]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China,
[59:05.000 --> 59:09.000]  there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[59:10.000 --> 59:19.000]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[59:24.000 --> 59:30.000]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective and perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[59:30.000 --> 59:35.000]  The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.
[59:40.000 --> 59:45.000]  Supernatural Silver is the number one choice of thousands for improved health and immune system support.
[59:46.000 --> 59:51.000]  To find out how Supernatural Silver can change your life, go to SupernaturalSilver.com

[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:19.000]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  All right, I'm going to take calls throughout the hour. Riding shotgun with us is Dr. Corey Gold. We're going to look at all the big scandals.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Got a bunch of breaking news. Will Obama stage something to get himself out of this? I don't even know if that'll work at this point.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  People say, well, the whole government's corrupt. Why go after Obama? You got to start punishing him somewhere or they think they can get away with anything.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  So the arrogant liar-in-chief is politically in deep trouble and his whole agenda is in deep trouble.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  And I just want to salute Ted Cruz and I want to salute Rand Paul because if it wasn't for them and you, the American people, they would have passed that anti-gun garbage.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And they would have already passed the amnesty stuff. And people are like, well, why was Rand Paul at first, why was Rand Paul at first, like, in a pro-amnesty?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  He wasn't. He was for real, reasonable path to citizenship for legal folks. But then when he saw the bill was a double-cross, he was against it.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  And, you know, it's kind of like he went to a Christian group yesterday or a few days ago and said, you know, I'm not a total libertarian.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  I want to run around naked smoking pot because I guess he's trying to fight the aqua-buda stuff. It's okay, Rand. Everybody had fun in college.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  And then libertarians are like, you're demonizing libertarians. No, he was trying to wake up a group of mainline Christians that libertarianism is a good idea.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  There's the article, Rand Paul, libertarians advocate, everyone go out, run around with no clothes on and smoke pot.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  And Kurt Nemo wrote a critical article. I don't control my writers. I respect Kurt. We have a difference of opinion on this article.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  And I'm not saying play politics, but I want Rand Paul to become president. I know Rand Paul. I know he's the real deal.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  I know he's a real person. That's why they don't like him. That's why they probably won't let him become president.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  Because they know, basically, folks, you know, they've already had articles going, Jones knows Rand's trying to co-opt the Republicans, not the other way around.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  That's why we've got to get Rand Paul. Notice our enemies don't like Rand. Okay, I know Rand Paul's real, okay, as real as it gets.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And he's very smooth and he's presidential material. And I think it's good to, you know, criticize him like Nemo did. That's Nemo's right.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  But I just don't agree with it. I mean, because I know what, I mean, it's a figure of speech.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  It's like Rand Paul says, Rand Paul says, hey, you can't just use drones randomly circling around where everybody's a suspect.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  Now, if somebody was a suspect and just robbed a liquor store, you know, then you could send a drone in on them.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  People are like, what, now he wants to use drones on us? No, he was trying to explain to people you just can't have drones hovering around where everybody's a suspect.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  That's a police state. He's trying to argue with them in a way to convince them, in a way to win.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  But then you notice, always at the key point, he tries to kill the NDAA. He tries to kill the Patriot Act. He tries to end the illegal wars.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  He tries to kill the foreign funding of all these nations that's bankrupting us and helping the globalist corporations use us to fund their empire.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  We don't get the spoils of this empire. He's killing the immigration bill while saying he's for it.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  And again, I'm not for using deception in politics. He said, yes, if the bill actually, you know, legally, people that are here legally and aren't on welfare and want to be contributing members of society, we need immigration.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  I'm all for that. And then the bill doesn't do that. It creates 30 million Democratic voters to take our guns. Then he's got credibility to blow the bill up.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  Same thing with Ted Cruz. And I didn't trust Ted Cruz up front. And I was even critical of him a few years ago when he started running.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  And we did an interview with him. We did a serious interview with Ted Cruz. And I got to say, I'm sold now. And that's just the way it is.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  And again, we can all sit there and nitpick all day long. If I see Rand Paul or Ted Cruz get off the libertarian constitutional reservation in their actions, then I will criticize them and say, hey, we like you better than Chuck Schumer trying to take our guns and, you know, Michael Moore.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  But hey, don't become Boehner. You know, but when Boehner comes out and says we need criminal charges, we need to have criminal investigations, we need to have a congressional investigation, we can't trust the Justice Department.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  I'm like, because Boehner is a politician. I don't like him. But if we can take him over, if we can throttle him politically and make him do the right thing, good.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  I mean, we need to politically bullwhip that little guy into doing what we want. We need to muscle for the Republic. This is a war.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
