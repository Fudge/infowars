[01:35.600 --> 01:39.560]  the best of people and the worst separation of the wheat from the chaff

[01:47.480 --> 01:52.640]  FBI and it goes on to say the FBI's manufactured almost every terror
[01:52.640 --> 01:57.320]  threat and has led them and it's fake and it's doing it to get power and take
[01:57.320 --> 02:02.680]  people's liberties the New York Times sounds like Alice Jones so let me see

[02:55.600 --> 03:02.480]  up on the international Luciferian slash commie day May day when Obama announced
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.960]  they're saying is he announced it on a Sunday evening that this is the one your
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.200]  anniversary but technically it was on May 1st so let's come up in a few days
[03:12.200 --> 03:22.640]  and they are now announcing that the police are investigating again not just
[03:22.640 --> 03:31.840]  the suspicious death of Breitbart's coroner but now the system is rolling out
[03:31.840 --> 03:38.720]  a fresh anew the whole hoax on the bin Laden killing front and I shot another

[03:53.440 --> 03:58.040]  guy on al-Qaeda no if the Republicans wanted to destroy Obama but they can't
[03:58.040 --> 04:02.560]  as they destroy themselves they'd go you're using al-Qaeda in Syria you're
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.360]  using al-Qaeda in Iran you're using al-Qaeda in Libya you turn the country
[04:06.360 --> 04:09.960]  over to them you're putting al-Qaeda like the Muslim brotherhood so they can
[04:09.960 --> 04:15.840]  have sex with their wives after they're dead that's that's real total lunatics
[04:15.840 --> 04:22.680]  you're putting them in charge of Egypt and they're also announcing war on
[04:22.680 --> 04:28.200]  terror is over they said last week a new article out saying al-Qaeda is gone but
[04:28.200 --> 04:32.000]  TSA's got to be in your neighborhood sticking their hands down your pants and
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.080]  searching your bags without a warrant because of the terror threat but that
[04:37.080 --> 04:41.520]  terror threat is all the domestic groups look at yourself in the mirror you don't

[06:22.960 --> 06:31.840]  FEMA region 6 Austin Texas transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[06:32.440 --> 06:39.200]  this is a big live Sunday edition with a lot of good news and a lot of really
[06:39.200 --> 06:43.800]  bad news but the good news is we know what's happening and the sleeping giant
[06:43.800 --> 06:48.120]  that is America in free humanity worldwide not just here in the United
[06:48.120 --> 06:52.560]  States North America the awakening is happening everywhere against government
[06:52.560 --> 06:57.800]  tyranny and corrupt elites and no amount of police state surveillance will
[06:57.800 --> 07:03.560]  protect the system we will restore the republic you know I confirmed over the
[07:03.560 --> 07:11.440]  weekend that a veteran what in Montana 61 years old was handing out Bible
[07:11.440 --> 07:16.840]  tracks at and in one of my films police state three total enslavement and the
[07:16.840 --> 07:20.200]  police came at the VA and told him we'll basically take your benefits send
[07:20.200 --> 07:25.800]  homeland security to your house you don't have free speech here and I've seen
[07:25.800 --> 07:29.600]  other cases of things like this and the cops didn't you know little federal cops
[07:29.600 --> 07:33.760]  little security guards didn't like the fact that was called police state and
[07:33.760 --> 07:38.760]  see there's that ignorance that any amount of government corruption I mean
[07:38.760 --> 07:43.760]  they could order our guns turned into Mara you know 50% tax increases and if
[07:43.760 --> 07:47.360]  you said you didn't like it and by the way this is surveilling us with no
[07:47.360 --> 07:51.840]  warrant is a police state a lot of these so-called police nowadays think that
[07:51.840 --> 07:56.320]  means you don't like them they think if you say I don't want a police state that
[07:56.320 --> 08:01.400]  you hate them personally and like the police state is their identity that
[08:01.400 --> 08:05.760]  that tyranny is their identity but then meanwhile you've got a lot of police
[08:05.760 --> 08:09.760]  officers and people out there that are aware that the bill of rights belongs to
[08:09.760 --> 08:14.320]  you as well it's very precious very special it was fought for and paid for
[08:14.320 --> 08:19.040]  in blood and we're now basically seeing it trampled and removed at an
[08:19.040 --> 08:24.080]  extremely accelerated rate and now it's like oxygens being taken out of the
[08:24.080 --> 08:28.640]  room you take the freedom the prosperity goes out the door it's kind of
[08:28.640 --> 08:33.800]  like going out on a motorboat to go skiing or something and taking a 50
[08:33.800 --> 08:39.080]  caliber semi-auto Barrett out there with you and firing six or seven holes in the
[08:39.080 --> 08:43.440]  bottom of the boat the boat is going to start taking on water and it's going to
[08:43.440 --> 08:50.640]  end up sinking and you guys in government and the public allowing this to
[08:50.640 --> 08:54.000]  happen and sitting back and just saying well they're the officials they're the
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.680]  authorities not the public servants you have allowed this to take place and and
[09:00.680 --> 09:06.760]  the country is now taking on water very very fast now that's the image of a
[09:06.760 --> 09:12.800]  sinking ship another image is a burning house and now the fire is on all three
[09:12.800 --> 09:17.760]  floors shooting out the windows the roof is collapsing and finally some of the
[09:17.760 --> 09:24.280]  public saying you know what we might be in a little bit of trouble and wow those
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.640]  people that warned us about corrupt government and police states and world
[09:28.640 --> 09:33.320]  government and surveillance they must have had a point they must have known
[09:33.320 --> 09:37.440]  what they were talking about they must have been paying attention when the
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.560]  tyranny was a mile away see now the tyranny's already run over us and now
[09:41.560 --> 09:48.240]  it's got that you'll backup sound on like a trash truck and it's backing back
[09:48.240 --> 09:55.240]  over us and I'm like you know what I think we ought to change things driving
[09:55.240 --> 10:02.240]  into work today I didn't see one I didn't see two I didn't see three I didn't
[10:02.240 --> 10:10.080]  see four I saw five info wars comm bumper stickers driving in the studio this
[10:10.080 --> 10:16.280]  Sunday but it gets better I saw dozens I could I had to stop counting I think I
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.600]  saw no other political bumper stickers I saw dozens of Ron Paul stickers and I
[10:20.600 --> 10:30.960]  saw a car that said vote rattlesnake 2012 with a big giant don't tread on me
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.160]  flag flapping above it they rigged it where it was it was an ingenious thing
[10:35.160 --> 10:38.840]  where where the flag was flapping in the middle of the car and like a little TP
[10:38.840 --> 10:44.160]  over it and and then explain that you know the rattlesnake represents don't
[10:44.160 --> 10:47.400]  tread on me and what this country was founded on all these great points and
[10:47.400 --> 10:53.840]  the car was festooned with stickers and I was going over to visit my dad before I
[10:53.840 --> 10:57.560]  came over here with my son or not to get our teeth clean my dad's a dentist he
[10:57.560 --> 11:01.680]  comes up you know every six months or so on Sunday so he can just focus on us and
[11:01.680 --> 11:05.000]  get that done and I almost pulled out of the parking lot to follow the person so
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.440]  you get a photo of the rattlesnake car but I bet they're a listener because I
[11:10.440 --> 11:15.800]  was able to see they had a info wars calm prison planet calm don't tread on me
[11:15.800 --> 11:19.520]  sticker the one that's got the rattlesnake on it and they got both the
[11:19.520 --> 11:25.600]  websites I did spy that with my eyeballs and so that person ever sends us a
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.440]  photo of their car and we will Twitter it out at real Alex Jones we will tweet
[11:30.440 --> 11:36.280]  it out if you send it to something like show tips at info wars calm and we're
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.440]  getting reports and photos and videos without even asking for them so now I'm
[11:40.440 --> 11:43.840]  going to start asking for them from all over the country of people for studying
[11:43.840 --> 11:48.440]  their barns their businesses their business signs sometimes other people's
[11:48.440 --> 11:53.880]  property and government buildings I'm not saying do that with info wars calm
[11:53.880 --> 11:59.280]  and I've got friends and family and neighbors my buddy changed down or the
[11:59.280 --> 12:03.320]  other day local friend go go back to high school years he had tweeted me no no
[12:03.320 --> 12:07.920]  we know he texted me a photo that tweeted out of a guy with a sign plugging
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.440]  the local radio station I'm on in Austin and info wars calm and then I talked
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.240]  to family and they said yeah we saw a couple people and I talked to some crew
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.880]  I mean it's just everywhere this is the explosive grassroots action against
[12:21.880 --> 12:29.280]  tyranny that we're starting to see as Ron Paul peaks we realize he won by running
[12:29.280 --> 12:34.800]  and injecting real ideas of libertarian constitutional ideas but as that begins
[12:34.800 --> 12:42.160]  to crest and then dissipate dissipation hasn't begun yet we're going to see it
[12:42.160 --> 12:50.560]  shift into local activism like that idea vote vote vote rattlesnake 2012 of them
[12:50.560 --> 12:53.360]  people like well what does that mean well it means the founding of this
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.040]  country let me explain what don't try it on me means and it's shifting into info
[12:57.040 --> 13:02.760]  wars calm it's shifting into thousands of people are now shooting videos for
[13:02.760 --> 13:07.640]  info wars calm we've gotten over 500 entries and hundreds more just came in
[13:07.640 --> 13:10.200]  the last few days I don't know how I'm gonna pick winners for the reporter
[13:10.200 --> 13:13.840]  contest we're gonna hire one male one female reporter $10,000 in prizes but
[13:13.840 --> 13:17.280]  all these other folks are saying hey Alex we don't even care if we win we want
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.840]  to be correspondents and I'm like absolutely I mean again how do you
[13:20.840 --> 13:25.800]  organize something like this so I'm gonna go to break and come back with the
[13:25.800 --> 13:32.160]  good news and I'm gonna come back with the bad news as well but I just wanted
[13:32.160 --> 13:39.720]  to upfront break down the fact that the info war has just begun to rise and as
[13:39.720 --> 13:44.960]  Ron Paul's always said he is a focal point of liberty and freedom and just a
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.360]  lot of people that have discovered what he's discovered tyranny versus
[13:49.360 --> 13:57.000]  liberty collectivism versus freedom globalism fascism communism versus the
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.880]  republic that that the pendulum is beginning to swing and so everybody
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.360]  out there realize our time has come people are ready to now listen I mean
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.720]  world governments openly being announced to Jenna 21 global governance
[14:11.720 --> 14:17.000]  every form of tyranny people are finally getting it because Ron Paul myself and
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.160]  countless others many of you out there listening today who are live before I
[14:20.160 --> 14:26.320]  was even born you were made fun of you were laughed at the national dominant
[14:26.320 --> 14:32.960]  corporate whore Decepticon enemy sympathizer new world order banker media

[14:38.720 --> 14:46.160]  dominate us not anymore and so because you trailblazers out there stood up from
[14:46.160 --> 14:50.200]  day one and spoke out against all this we've got a real shot at defeating the
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.720]  globalist because we've planted so many seeds for so many decades and now as
[14:54.720 --> 14:58.280]  everything we talked about begins to unfold exactly as we said it would our
[14:58.280 --> 15:04.320]  credibility is beyond platinum the enemy's credibility is like dog
[15:04.320 --> 15:09.560]  droppings at the park nobody wants it it's it's it has a negative value
[15:09.560 --> 15:13.640]  Congress is a 9% approval rating the mainstream media is in free fall but
[15:13.640 --> 15:18.200]  danger the Empire is going to strike back with censorship attacks on talk

[15:28.640 --> 15:32.080]  telling the truth and you'd have an audience again we're actually starting
[15:32.080 --> 15:36.800]  to see that happen see there's nothing like the market to defeat tyrants and
[15:36.800 --> 15:41.800]  centralized systems CBS Republicans prepare contempt citation against Eric

[20:52.640 --> 20:56.960]  had instigators inside the protest that's why the new Black Panther Party was

[21:10.520 --> 21:16.240]  called the Hagellian dialectic we're gonna be going over that again after the
[21:16.240 --> 21:21.800]  break the big news because it gets into total propaganda Obama exploits bin
[21:21.800 --> 21:25.880]  Laden hoax for election propaganda I'm gonna go back over the fact that this is
[21:25.880 --> 21:30.760]  an admitted fraud sure nobody I know bought that they actually killed him
[21:30.760 --> 21:33.960]  then they had to kill the seals that were involved to cover it up later on
[21:33.960 --> 21:37.160]  that helicopter remember not the one they blew up at night but the next one
[21:37.160 --> 21:41.080]  they blew up with seals on it yeah I've talked to seals by the way they all
[21:41.080 --> 21:46.560]  know what happened oh yeah that's a big wake-up call inside the government but
[21:46.560 --> 21:53.520]  continuing here now we're gonna be going over all of that and
[21:53.520 --> 22:00.360]  Osama's supposed killer Obama bragging about it at the White House I'm a movie
[22:00.360 --> 22:07.280]  star correspondence dinner so that is all coming up also banks cooperate to
[22:07.280 --> 22:11.680]  track occupy protesters we have the big six Federal Reserve megabanks they are
[22:11.680 --> 22:18.520]  the government they took over all of that is coming up also have a report in
[22:18.520 --> 22:23.800]  the science stack this is a report out of Reuters how long I've been telling you
[22:23.800 --> 22:28.640]  this but here it is scientists call for a rethink on consumption and population
[22:28.640 --> 22:33.240]  reduction oh your scientific American Royal Society calls for redistribution
[22:33.240 --> 22:40.600]  of wealth and more British control more birth control to save the planet and I
[22:40.600 --> 22:44.680]  had a Freudian slip there saying more British control more eugenics control
[22:44.680 --> 22:51.200]  out of England I'll be breaking that down but first let's get into these two
[22:51.200 --> 22:57.080]  reports right here here is the New York Times and when I saw this I pinched
[22:57.080 --> 23:03.040]  myself because I've known this I reported it at nauseam even some
[23:03.040 --> 23:06.960]  mainstream media has reported on if you follow each case they almost always get
[23:06.960 --> 23:12.360]  dropped they almost always find a mentally retarded person generally 75 to
[23:12.360 --> 23:16.960]  80 IQ mildly retarded who has been profiled been in prison or is on
[23:16.960 --> 23:21.360]  welfare or up or someone who's been had serious head trauma they've also used
[23:21.360 --> 23:24.880]  head trauma victims is one of their favorites and I've talked about it I
[23:24.880 --> 23:30.240]  could go to downtown Austin where I live and I could find a schizophrenic or a
[23:30.240 --> 23:34.200]  homeless person and offer them $10,000 and get them address up in a uniform and
[23:34.200 --> 23:38.840]  say they work for Al Qaeda and say that they're ready to blow stuff up if I give
[23:38.840 --> 23:43.480]  them $10,000 and that's what the FBI does they just take a year or so to get
[23:43.480 --> 23:47.080]  them an apartment and set them up and then try to get them to blow stuff up
[23:47.080 --> 23:51.000]  first World Trade Center FBI cooked a bomb trained the driver gave them the
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.440]  detonators that was in the New York Times and CBS News even at the time
[23:54.440 --> 23:58.640]  because the head guy they had to do it knew they were setting him up so he
[23:58.640 --> 24:02.400]  recorded the FBI ordering him to go ahead with the bombing and they let the
[24:02.400 --> 24:05.560]  two mentally retarded guys I'm sorry that's what happened go ahead and thank
[24:05.560 --> 24:08.280]  God they didn't park it up against the column like they were supposed to the
[24:08.280 --> 24:11.440]  globals had to come back and finish the job a few years later on 9-11
[24:11.440 --> 24:16.880]  continuing though the New York Times today terrorist plots hatched by the
[24:16.880 --> 24:23.160]  FBI wow sounds like info wars.com article David Shippler I guess the New
[24:23.160 --> 24:25.960]  York Times wants to stay in the game and actually cover some real news the
[24:25.960 --> 24:30.280]  United States has narrowly been saved from lethal terrorist plots in recent
[24:30.280 --> 24:37.960]  years or so it has seemed a would-be suicide bomber was intercepted on his
[24:37.960 --> 24:42.200]  way to the Capitol a scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot stinger missiles
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.840]  at military aircraft was developed by men in Newborough New York that's just
[24:47.840 --> 24:51.040]  like all the synagogues and and and black churches that get the swastikas
[24:51.040 --> 24:55.080]  put on them and in every case the groups do it themselves and people say well
[24:55.080 --> 24:59.240]  why why do it to yourself really why Hitler blow up his own Capitol building
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.520]  why did our government attack its own ships and say the Viet Cong did it to
[25:03.520 --> 25:09.640]  start the Vietnam War Gulf of Tonkin I mean you don't know why let me give you
[25:09.640 --> 25:15.160]  a final fantasies a cartoon pretty good movie and the head general wants to be
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.400]  able to take over so he lets the enemy into one of the main command bases
[25:19.400 --> 25:25.000]  children's movies understand this but adults go I just don't see why the
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.440]  government would let terrorists attack us because they use the terrorists it's
[25:29.440 --> 25:36.880]  not our government it's foreign banks continuing but all these dramas were
[25:36.880 --> 25:43.760]  facilitated by the FBI it goes on men in Newborough New York had a fancival idea
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.800]  to fly explosive-laden model airplanes in the Pentagon and the Capitol was
[25:48.800 --> 25:53.320]  hatched in Massachusetts but all these dramas were facilitated by the FBI
[25:53.320 --> 25:58.720]  whose undercover agents and informers posed as terrorists offering a dummy
[25:58.720 --> 26:04.080]  missile fake C4 explosives a dismantled suicide vest and rudimentary training
[26:04.080 --> 26:07.640]  suspects naively played their parts until they were arrested yeah the guy
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.400]  that was gonna blow up the Christmas tree in Portland turned out he had been
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.080]  totally picked told to attack the Christmas tree by the FBI that's the
[26:16.080 --> 26:22.200]  issue they go find literal loons or mentally retarded people they profile
[26:22.200 --> 26:28.240]  and then they tell them what to attack clan groups all of it black new black
[26:28.240 --> 26:35.080]  Panthers top white supremacist over and over again all over the country it's
[26:35.080 --> 26:42.560]  admitted when an Oregon student Mohammed Osama Muhammad I mean what a moron that
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.120]  changes name to that thought of using a car bomb to attack a festive Christmas
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.400]  tree lighting ceremony in Portland the FBI provided a van loaded with six fifty
[26:51.400 --> 26:55.280]  five gallon drums of inert material harmless blasting caps and detonator
[26:55.280 --> 26:58.680]  record and a gallon of diesel fuel to make the van smell flammable
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.920]  undercover FBI agent even at the driving but mr. Muhammad the passenger
[27:03.920 --> 27:10.160]  sheet to trigger the bomb they go is this legal is it legitimate folks of
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.560]  course it's not the point is the FBI has carried out the attacks before I
[27:14.560 --> 27:18.880]  point you back to the New York Times back in 1993 for the first World Trade
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.880]  Center attack now let me bring into the next little little tidbit
[27:23.880 --> 27:28.160]  remember I pointed out that Breitbart was just saying he was going to release
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.080]  that day stuff with Obama at Communist meetings and and and calling for you
[27:33.080 --> 27:37.960]  know communism and race war and stuff like that he died hours before he was
[27:37.960 --> 27:42.800]  going to release it and the media said within an hour and a half not more than
[27:42.800 --> 27:46.200]  two hours that don't worry it's natural causes nothing to see her move along
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.240]  even though it takes you three four weeks with Whitney Houston months for
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.440]  Michael Jackson anybody else they within an hour and a half just the media just
[27:54.440 --> 27:58.880]  said listen he you know he died normally we don't know how he died but
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.360]  just go to sleep and then the main medical examiner's office came out said
[28:05.360 --> 28:08.920]  well our preliminary autopsy is done but the toxicology isn't there's not
[28:08.920 --> 28:13.280]  extreme trauma there's not too much blunt force trauma so we're we're saying
[28:13.280 --> 28:16.400]  that you know he wasn't killed by that but we'll have our final report that got
[28:16.400 --> 28:23.640]  spun into Alex Jones is wrong Breitbart you know Alex Jones is terrible
[28:23.640 --> 28:27.080]  conspiracy theorist Breitbart the coroner says natural causes and when
[28:27.080 --> 28:32.400]  that's not what they said all I said was we should look into this well well
[28:32.400 --> 28:36.920]  what's world net daily reporting it's also out in the LA papers Breitbart's
[28:36.920 --> 28:42.560]  coroner poisoned to death the police are looking into who may have killed the
[28:42.560 --> 28:48.560]  coroner who was poisoned and is dead from poison they've confirmed that oh oh
[28:48.560 --> 28:54.040]  oh but I'm sure it's a coincidence right I mean the government never lies to us

[33:06.640 --> 33:31.320]  Broadcasting Network thank you for spending part of your Sunday with us
[33:31.320 --> 33:35.520]  more and more of America and the rest of the world is waking up that you better
[33:35.520 --> 33:43.560]  be involved in politics or basically get enslaved and that the true American
[33:43.560 --> 33:49.720]  virtue is being informed and is being involved and is detesting the culture
[33:49.720 --> 33:54.360]  of dependency and big government but conservatives are waking up to the fact
[33:54.360 --> 34:00.800]  that big mega corporations are funding and manipulating and controlling the
[34:00.800 --> 34:06.480]  politicians who then turn government into a giant vacuum cleaner to suck up
[34:06.480 --> 34:10.560]  your wealth and transfer it to them in government contracts and bailouts but
[34:10.560 --> 34:17.200]  more importantly to shut down the mega corporations competition I'm a local
[34:17.200 --> 34:23.120]  Austin quote business I hire over 30 people here locally also have contractors
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.720]  in other countries and people like the Watson's over in England the Watson
[34:27.720 --> 34:33.440]  brothers Paul Watson Steve Watson but I can't even get a phone call back if I
[34:33.440 --> 34:36.960]  call the city of Austin and we've done it and said yeah I'd like one of your
[34:36.960 --> 34:41.920]  people to come out and talk about cutting my taxes or getting rid of my
[34:41.920 --> 34:47.040]  local taxes waving them like you do for all these big companies and I'll hire
[34:47.040 --> 34:52.720]  more people and they laugh at you but I was reading in California in a town
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.280]  where Apple only has 10 employees they pay no taxes and wherever they have them
[34:57.280 --> 35:02.680]  they pay no taxes because it's Al Gore who's on the board and they have suicide
[35:02.680 --> 35:06.520]  nets around the Apple factories in China some of the worst in the planet
[35:06.520 --> 35:12.280]  because they want pure giant profits and that pig Al Gore was here a few months
[35:12.280 --> 35:18.880]  ago and got over eight million dollars cut off in taxes for Apple that pig
[35:18.880 --> 35:23.360]  that's talking about how I need to have my taxes raised and Warren Buffett the
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.840]  biggest recipient of bailout money in the last four years trillions of
[35:27.840 --> 35:31.560]  dollars to his companies over three billion to him individually in one
[35:31.560 --> 35:37.600]  phase individually three billion of your tax money and that piece of trash gets
[35:37.600 --> 35:41.760]  up there and uses class warfare envy with ignorant working-class people and
[35:41.760 --> 35:46.440]  says gee my secretary pays a higher percentage than I do that's not fair
[35:46.440 --> 35:50.680]  because you wrote the stinking laws they changed in the 80s and 90s he
[35:50.680 --> 35:57.440]  literally wrote the change to get rid of Glass-Steagall he literally out of
[35:57.440 --> 36:02.240]  anybody is the author of this and then he sits there after he's done this to us
[36:02.240 --> 36:06.800]  and wants to raise my taxes anybody making over a hundred twenty five
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.280]  thousand dollars here individually quarter million collectively that's not
[36:10.280 --> 36:15.040]  the rich that's the people that buy cars and houses that's the people that go on
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.840]  vacations that's the people to get their hair done that come to your
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.000]  restaurant and all over Austin where I live one of the wealthiest cities in the
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.240]  country I see shops and places clothes closing places I've gone to for decades
[36:26.240 --> 36:31.800]  shutting down I see the big box stores half empty even this is the blight of
[36:31.800 --> 36:37.760]  big government in no amount of tens of trillions will ever pay off all the
[36:37.760 --> 36:41.880]  derivatives garbage these bankers have had a sign on to now continuing here
[36:41.880 --> 36:47.240]  none of that matters though none of that matters doesn't matter of America's
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.440]  brilliant depression or the housing market sinking faster or unemployment in
[36:51.440 --> 36:54.480]  close to 50 million on food stamps doesn't matter of the throw in the
[36:54.480 --> 36:58.160]  Bill of Rights the Constitution out the window and increasing all the domestic
[36:58.160 --> 37:03.320]  spy funding and TSA in every major city now running warrantless checkpoints on
[37:03.320 --> 37:06.640]  highways outside of the 10th Amendment not just the 4th Amendment they
[37:06.640 --> 37:17.040]  doesn't matter because being Latin got killed on international commie day mayday a year ago
[37:17.040 --> 37:22.680]  doesn't matter I had top State Department official and CIA black op you know
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.480]  trainer the guy that wrote Tom Clancy's books with him CFR member Dr. Steve
[37:27.480 --> 37:31.840]  Pachennick made headlines all over the country when he first came on my show in
[37:31.840 --> 37:36.560]  2002 and said bin Laden died of Marfan's a kidney failure the American hospital in
[37:36.560 --> 37:42.760]  Dubai then it came out on CBS later and confirmed it this broke here just like it
[37:42.760 --> 37:46.760]  broke that the underwear bomber was gotten on the plane by the US government
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.760]  Kurt Haskell it by the way's on tomorrow the lawyer with his wife sees all this
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.080]  happen he gets on with no no passport turns out the US government demanded
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.880]  they give him a visa Natalib and then a month and a half later on C-SPAN the
[38:00.880 --> 38:04.400]  Undersecretary of State admits they were ordered by an unnamed agency to get the
[38:04.400 --> 38:13.320]  underwear bomber on the plane drugged out of his mind I'm digressing Pachennick
[38:13.320 --> 38:16.160]  goes you got a lot of courage I want to come on your show and tell you something
[38:16.160 --> 38:20.640]  he comes on he says he died he's on ice Bush is gonna roll him out in the 0 for
[38:20.640 --> 38:24.680]  election this is Pachennick you can look up Steve Pachennick they have like
[38:24.680 --> 38:28.440]  times of London saying you know you know he could manipulate he manipulated the
[38:28.440 --> 38:31.640]  communist into killing the prime minister of Italy and stuff I mean this is a
[38:31.640 --> 38:36.200]  guy who's assassinated you know presidents and foreign countries a real
[38:36.200 --> 38:40.600]  mission impossible guy okay the real deal by the way I want to get Pachennick on
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.200]  this week I keep forgetting because it's this whole bin Laden thing then Walter
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.400]  Cronkite comes out and says yes Bush is gonna use this against Kerry don't you
[38:50.400 --> 38:55.400]  dare try it then Madeline Albright the former Secretary of State under
[38:55.400 --> 39:01.560]  hair Clinton comes out on CNN and NBC I played the clips here you look them up
[39:01.560 --> 39:04.360]  we've written articles about it and says yeah he's dead they're gonna roll him
[39:04.360 --> 39:14.440]  out so they backed off and later pulled him out but the issue here that I'm
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.360]  getting at is that if you go to info wars.com we've republished the articles
[39:18.360 --> 39:25.920]  from last year with the latest info about how ridiculously fake it is and how
[39:25.920 --> 39:35.000]  Obama at the correspondence banquet in a TV ad they're running what's the name
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.280]  of that stupid TV ever about to play it again one chance sounds like prom night
[39:40.280 --> 39:49.960]  or something one chance more like spring break the point is I'm sorry it's
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.560]  just this is this is so this is such theater there he is at the correspondence
[39:54.560 --> 39:57.700]  dinner with all these Hollywood people to make it look like government is
[39:57.700 --> 40:02.280]  Hollywood ever Bernays the head of the psychological warfare the Department of
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.640]  War pre-department of defense came up with all that he said we'll put Hollywood
[40:06.640 --> 40:09.840]  people up there with government will blur the lines will make it like their
[40:09.840 --> 40:13.720]  stars this will make the public submit to government plus they'll think the
[40:13.720 --> 40:16.920]  president actually runs everything so we can put a new one in every four day
[40:16.920 --> 40:21.840]  years and fool the public by the way the author of tragedy and hope the head of
[40:21.840 --> 40:25.560]  Georgetown political science Carol Quigley Bill Clinton's mentor also wrote
[40:25.560 --> 40:31.200]  that in tragedy and hope then Iran Paul comes along doesn't play ball with that
[40:31.200 --> 40:34.480]  and it screws up their whole fantasy lands they've got to cheat him in the
[40:34.480 --> 40:38.080]  first few primaries till it looks like he's not a winner sad issue though now
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.960]  it's admitted he wanted man in Iowa like I told you he did he was the leader he
[40:42.960 --> 40:46.440]  would have been the nominee that shows the power the Liberty movement now they
[40:46.440 --> 40:50.760]  had to steal it oh yeah this week it all got confirmed he really won what is it
[40:50.760 --> 40:54.160]  four states he really won they stole and the Republican leadership says we don't
[40:54.160 --> 41:00.640]  care if it's proof he won you're not getting it anyways continuing article up
[41:00.640 --> 41:06.520]  at info wars.com Obama exploits bin Laden hoax for election propaganda let's go
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.280]  over the lies there was that first situation room photo they released that
[41:11.280 --> 41:17.640]  Mayday Sunday evening a year ago and it was clearly a staged photo looked like
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.940]  a movie poster Hillary's covering her mouth Obama's looking all serious the
[41:21.940 --> 41:25.600]  generals looking down the computer everybody's you know it's like football

[41:29.240 --> 41:34.240]  live cams they all tell the lie on TV they watched him die people say release
[41:34.240 --> 41:37.440]  the footage they go we didn't tape it actually oh and bin Laden wasn't in a
[41:37.440 --> 41:41.200]  firefight he didn't use his wife as a shield and then there was no dialysis
[41:41.200 --> 41:45.040]  machine by the way in the house he'd been in for years almost on death's door
[41:45.040 --> 41:51.360]  with the CIA visiting 2001 CBS News report on it 2002 it's a fact Al-Qaeda's
[41:51.360 --> 41:55.120]  used to attack living in Al-Syria I have articles today where we're told Al-Qaeda's
[41:55.120 --> 41:59.320]  not a threat now they're our friends it's the American people are the new enemy so
[41:59.320 --> 42:04.640]  the war on terror is over but now the war is on you but side issue you get this

[42:43.800 --> 42:50.640]  we have a clip we'll play later of Obama laughing and saying you know my dad was
[42:50.640 --> 42:55.840]  born in Kenya but I was born in Hawaii and he winks everybody laughs he he's
[42:55.840 --> 42:59.400]  blocked all his high school college records it's on record he had two
[42:59.400 --> 43:02.400]  different names that's now been confirmed that was called a conspiracy

[48:43.840 --> 48:48.160]  spiking the football and producing a Hollywood movie with real Navy SEALs
[48:48.160 --> 48:52.360]  about the killing of bin Laden and releasing that just unbelievable
[48:52.360 --> 48:57.080]  propaganda you've got fake situation room photos so they watch live footage a
[48:57.080 --> 49:00.880]  totally fake story they go back on and later admit isn't true you've got the
[49:00.880 --> 49:05.800]  Navy SEAL helicopter that witnesses said was had somebody piled on board with
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.560]  them it blows up killing those then the Navy SEALs start speaking out a large
[49:11.560 --> 49:15.640]  portion of SEAL team 6 is packed suspiciously on a National Guard
[49:15.640 --> 49:19.720]  helicopter we're told they're flying out to save Army Rangers turned out that
[49:19.720 --> 49:25.120]  wasn't true it blows up killing all on board I've talked to a Navy SEAL who has
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.720]  a friend in SEAL team 6 and they say yes a bomb was on board and they think it
[49:29.720 --> 49:33.520]  could have been guess who some of them think oh it must have been Al Qaeda yeah
[49:33.520 --> 49:37.600]  that got on the basin did it or they're smart enough to understand no traders
[49:37.600 --> 49:43.480]  run the government so dead men tell no tales but but but think about it we have
[49:43.480 --> 49:47.520]  a government caught lying to us over and over again we have a so-called
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.680]  government caught stealing trillions of dollars we have a government caught
[49:50.680 --> 49:54.920]  doing thousands of different lethal tests on our own troops project shad
[49:54.920 --> 49:59.600]  chemical biological radiological atomic soldiers to ski experiments all the
[49:59.600 --> 50:05.560]  new experiments coming out a national security state based on eugenics where
[50:05.560 --> 50:09.200]  they believe we're dumb animals and openly brag about how they created
[50:09.200 --> 50:12.720]  bisphene all they to sterilize us and how they're putting sterilants in the
[50:12.720 --> 50:17.720]  water I've got articles on that today Reuters scientists call for rethink on
[50:17.720 --> 50:24.040]  consumption population reduction this is the religion of the people running
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.880]  things they think of you as animals and so we're just supposed to sit there when
[50:28.880 --> 50:35.360]  known liars tell us an official story we're supposed to just sit there and go
[50:35.360 --> 50:39.320]  well you you've lied to me hundreds of times that I've caught you before and
[50:39.320 --> 50:42.840]  you've been caught doing all these terrible things but I'm just going to
[50:42.840 --> 50:49.320]  believe you now because you say so and then if you question known liars you're
[50:49.320 --> 50:54.840]  called a supposed conspiracy theorist which means someone who questions known
[50:54.840 --> 51:01.680]  liars it'd be like if you went to the carnival and some carnival barker was
[51:01.680 --> 51:05.280]  saying come on get over here you're gonna win and when you don't win they make
[51:05.280 --> 51:08.680]  fun of you and say come on you can do it you can get something for the little
[51:08.680 --> 51:13.440]  lady if you say what you're being a carnival barker manipulating me you're
[51:13.440 --> 51:18.440]  a conspiracy theorist no you're making a judgment about known liars but they're
[51:18.440 --> 51:23.520]  saying don't have judgment don't have discernment you're walking down a dark
[51:23.520 --> 51:27.480]  alley at night to get to your car you see somebody creep into the shadows looks
[51:27.480 --> 51:31.640]  like they've got a club in their hand or a wrench maybe you go back the other
[51:31.640 --> 51:36.760]  direction oh you're a conspiracy theorist for making a judgment on known
[51:36.760 --> 51:40.960]  liars now again they won't show us the body they say they threw them in the
[51:40.960 --> 51:44.800]  ocean they discipline a bunch of people on the ship at record numbers who were
[51:44.800 --> 51:48.760]  starting to say it was a bunch of baloney a bunch of the Navy SEALs involved die
[51:48.760 --> 51:55.960]  in two separate incidents it's all scripted they change the story over and
[51:55.960 --> 52:02.600]  over again and I've got high-level government sources including this was
[52:02.600 --> 52:07.240]  bizarre when I got contacted by a currently serving super high-level CIA
[52:07.240 --> 52:11.080]  person to just say we want to tell you you're absolutely right about bin Laden
[52:11.080 --> 52:18.920]  and everything else that was the message and that was relayed to me that person
[52:18.920 --> 52:24.000]  was relayed through to me by a national talk show host
[52:26.800 --> 52:30.960]  national talk show host this person would like to talk to you this they are
[52:30.960 --> 52:35.320]  who they say they are they would like to turn and then I get on the telephone

[52:51.080 --> 52:57.040]  a psychiatrist he tells it's it's all fake then Walter Cronkite comes up and
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.960]  backs it up and then Marilyn Albright does and that doesn't even get news

[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.320]  poisoned man I tell you people are like Alex why are you still alive because of
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.040]  your prayers also I'm a talk show host not like I'm a coroner who could say
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:42.080]  hey they're covering this up they really killed him but I mean I saw him kill
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.040]  Gary Webb pull it surprised when her had his new book coming out totally gonna
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.840]  prove that government was shipping and even more drugs it already been admitted
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.240]  and I talked to him a couple months before they killed him and I was like
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:59.480]  can I get you on he goes hey are you good at websites I'd like to send you a
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:02.920]  disc of all my material and post on a website I never got around to it but he
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.080]  ended up having somebody else do it before he got killed and it was just a
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:10.840]  bunch of news articles and research and things and then hours after he's killed
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.360]  the media is like it's quite normal to shoot yourself twice in the head and
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.760]  it was a suicide note meanwhile I talked to his neighbors people been breaking in
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:24.760]  his house he said he'd been threatened he told me that he told friends that I've
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.280]  had on the show
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:33.800]  so nobody shoots me and twice in the head I was killed let's go to a phone
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.840]  call or two and we'll come back go to more calls and then I'm gonna get into
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.480]  the latest on Syspa a bunch of economic news and some eugenics news there's a
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:50.080]  lot of news here but right now let's go to Richard in Texas you're on the air
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.400]  thank you hi Alex how you doing man I'm glad I caught you on this Sunday I got
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.960]  a question I want you to answer for me have you noticed all these so-called
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:05.160]  security guards on his campus campus college campuses pulling cars over do
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.640]  they got the right to do that their security guards they're not 80 I don't
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.920]  believe they should be doing that but if they have signs posted see they have a
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:20.120]  citizen's arrest power just like police do and so technically I think they can
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.800]  pull you over and then hold you the and of course a lot of them are now packing
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.160]  heat and tasers and things and it's just the new economy is police and
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:36.200]  security guards and TSA type stuff what have you been witnessing I've been
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:39.920]  waiting simple and pulling the people over on side road they're not even on
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:44.280]  and I know the campus you know put loads and going through the cars searching
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:50.880]  and everything sir I mean I was out in Montana and they had foreigners in fake
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.440]  police cars pulling people over and everybody just bowed down to them it
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:59.040]  was on national news so yeah it's called just lawlessness I mean look when the
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:03.320]  feds come to your town with the TSA out of their jurisdiction it's just as
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:07.040]  illegal as some security guard police all over the place now are forcing their
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:13.960]  way in houses without warrants I mean the government is engaging in premeditated
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:19.440]  precedent-setting events to basically for lack of a better term defecate all
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.360]  over the Bill of Rights and Constitution to set a precedent they're
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.680]  like beetles or something just digging into everything well let me ask you this
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.160]  now to be on Bill to get a hundred percent a hundred percent real so what
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.240]  would you recommend somebody to go to the local PD station ask them do these
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:40.640]  security security guard got the right to pull you number one you have to look is
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.520]  at the University of Texas or are you this is a local University of Georgia down
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:52.160]  there to gain PLU that's the Lutheran I don't believe they do but don't go off
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:55.760]  my advice you to look at the specific area but I would just go in and follow
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.000]  complaint and I was I mean I would go into the Dean's office and I would I
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  would look at the law and I would do your own research and thank you they've
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.960]  been doing I know this too you should you have you should shoot video of this
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:16.400]  and put it on YouTube make a big issue out of it you know I'm like you but I'm
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.440]  I'm a little bit more extreme than you or I don't believe in computers man because
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.680]  I don't want things done but you can blame it in people track them any way
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.760]  they can't so I don't know I mean it is all designed to track us but it we're
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.080]  already such desperate straights we've got to use it against him inside the
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:36.560]  matrix like grid but listen I appreciate your call I'll have to look into that but
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.080]  when a security guard stops you at a store it's a citizen's arrest and if I
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.040]  catch somebody walking out of my neighbor's house with a safe in their
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:50.400]  arms I've got a right to stop them the police only arrest under under citizens
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.520]  arrest power they're just specially trained and then delegated by the city
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.600]  under the state charter they're just trying to train you you don't have a
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.040]  right to defend yourself so they have a monopoly a force Alex Jones with five
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.280]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.680]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.040]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is

[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.680]  like right barred and then my corner falls down and dies of being poisoned as
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.920]  of the LA Times and world net daily are reporting that you that I will get to
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:51.440]  your phone call so barring that I'm bright-barted or or or or or Arkansas
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.760]  did you know Bill Clinton I didn't have sex with that woman you know he had a
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:00.000]  medical examiner that you could be shot 26 times and have your arms and legs cut
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.040]  off and be found in a trash dump with your burning car and family Malik in
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:10.760]  Arkansas he'd say it was suicide so I and yes we just joined this bright bar
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:15.080]  they are reporting the police are saying he was poisoned to death and they're
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:19.480]  investigating who killed him or it was accidental poisoning the death show boy
[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.240]  we won't get that final report now right Bart says I got something to destroy
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.560]  the president drops dead hours before three weeks later they put out some
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.640]  milk toast video that wasn't what he said he would do and we're not supposed to
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.000]  question that though oh well governments involved there's no way
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.600]  anything's happening anybody knows governments never do anything wrong I
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.320]  mean our founding fathers said they're deadly dangerous and don't trust them
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:46.880]  and history shows governments the biggest unnatural killer 222 million
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.920]  people government killed the 20th century non-military related that's
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.520]  lining up men women and children and shoot them and stuff 262 million but
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.320]  don't you question them don't you be a conspiracy theorist because government
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:07.800]  loves you so your phone calls are coming up we're supposed to just believe that
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.840]  on the one-year anniversary a known liar Obama who said he wouldn't sign the
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:17.360]  NDA to secretly arrest Americans and then did sign it and it turned out lobbied
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.320]  for it and demanded the secret arrest provisions being there he says he won't
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:27.120]  sign SISPA that's to kill opposition so people let it pass the Senate it's past
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.680]  the house I mean all the top lawyers internet experts say oh it just it ends
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:36.600]  the fourth amendment and ends freedom on the web and Internet IDs total control
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.960]  everything else but you know what Obama says he'll veto it that means he'll sign
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.960]  it all he does is live I've never seen he makes Bill Clinton look truthful
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.320]  literally and as bad as Bush was I mean I thought nothing could be that bad oh
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.280]  it's far worse and he's just a puppet it means the elite have nothing but
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:01.680]  disdain for you again the Attorney General is on the verge of contempt
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:08.280]  charges by Congress on fast and furious for lying yeah it's drugs and
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:14.840]  hang grenades not just guns and that's in real papers since Chicago Tribune it's
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:22.040]  in El Paso times it was broken in info wars.com in February of 2011 one of our
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.560]  listeners said if you notice this in the Chicago federal court filings and in the
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.640]  Texas court filings that the federal government is admitting because we had
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.760]  listeners searching around in the Chicago filings on the white
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.560]  supremacist leader Hal Turner who was always attacking me it turned out he was
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.200]  a Fed it had come out in federal court that he was a high-level national
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.640]  security asset of the FBI trying to cause a race war you know they got that
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.000]  on the white side too not just new Black Panther Party it came out being run by
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.760]  the Justice Department that came out two weeks ago they had them out saying kill
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:54.760]  Whiting and all that they want to get a race war going they want to create a
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:59.040]  crisis like shipping now we learned 20 plus thousand guns in the Mexico and
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.680]  hang grenades trying to get a total war down there to then blame the Second
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:05.640]  Amendment and they don't care that they got caught they went ahead and just
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:14.000]  blamed it anyways but I do get a little ray of sunshine a little ray of hope when
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.920]  they are talking about contempt citation against Eric Holder who by the way is a
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:28.160]  very dangerous person I mean I don't enjoy getting up here and having to
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.840]  confront this guy he I was the deputy attorney general and the federal lawsuits
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.680]  have brought out documents where he was quote running the cover-up of Oklahoma
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.360]  City you know it's his emails going this is a D-day situation get down there and
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.120]  cover this up cover what up bud cover what up I mean you look I know who you
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:49.880]  are believe me I don't think sometimes you know the feds will threaten us or and
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:54.480]  they'll say you know we do this and that or we and I'm like what you don't think
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:59.840]  I don't know like yeah but we're killers aren't you scared I mean somebody's got
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:07.000]  to stand up to you okay so there is that piece of news so I thought I'd get to
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.520]  this because because these known liars are now coming out and telling us that
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.240]  they killed bin Laden and they've changed the whole story over and over again
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.600]  I've already gone over that and their whole new election campaign and I'm not
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:24.480]  even saying I like Mitt Romney the point is this is ridiculous now remember back
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.560]  in 2008 ABC News was reporting on this flashback
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.800]  Obama campaign accused Clinton of using bin Laden to score political points in
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:37.760]  08 saying he was dead and they killed him in a drone attack all the experts
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.760]  said he was dead oh but no they got his body but you can't see it and the Navy
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.760]  Seals that went and got him they're dead their helicopter blew up but again don't
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.680]  don't question that or Breitbart's coroner dropping dead a poisoning no big
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.280]  deal everything's fine DC madam's on my show she goes I've got names of all
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.320]  these top officials I'm not going to present and I said you better release
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:06.760]  them right now you're dead then I talked to her apartment manager she'd known
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.720]  for years he said yeah no they were following her they were threatened to
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.320]  kill her she's trying to get the documents to her mom they killed her you
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.600]  know this isn't a game ladies and gentlemen this is not a game let me
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.200]  play this disgusting clip and then we'll go to your phone calls this is the new
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:30.080]  ad called one chance but they're running with all the big Goldman Sachs JP
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.200]  Morgan banker bailout money they took from your taxes yeah that's where tax
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.120]  money goes that's why they're all lobbying to raise your taxes and they're
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.040]  telling you the war on terror is over I've got that in the New York Times today
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.760]  but it's expanding TSA's on the street now and you don't have any rights but
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.600]  Al Qaeda is not a threat because Al Qaeda works for the bankers that took the
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.560]  country over no now the whole Homeland Security apparatus is for you remember
[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.200]  all the TV ads where they show nothing but white terrorists now and minorities
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.840]  reporting them they're now rebranding it to the guy in the John Deere had
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:04.200]  literally most these videos almost pretty puts out it's a gun of John Deere
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.680]  had oh oh my gosh don't trust him they're everywhere I mean it's how

[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.200]  the president is the decider in chief oh nobody can make that decision for you
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:29.640]  he did it look he knew what would happen suppose the Navy SEALs had gone in
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:35.040]  there and it hadn't been Bin Laden suppose they've been captured or killed
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:38.880]  really all we had to do was blow the helicopter over horrible for oh but we

[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:31.360]  you can believe me my name is Bill Clinton the Easter Bunny's real Santa
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:38.080]  Claus is real and the president derrigly had the Easter Bunny who attacked us on
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.480]  9-11 he took him out with the Navy SEALs Navy SEALs helicopter blew up and
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:48.360]  then the others that survived they blew up too but never mind that and never mind
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:52.680]  Breitbart never mind his coroner dying being poisoned the police say he was
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.720]  killed with poison that's not a big deal either
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:01.320]  after all I'm your president Bill Clinton
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:05.600]  all right I gotta go to your calls but let me finish up with a ridiculous I
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:09.640]  thought I was gonna get a free house and free car and free health care remember
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:14.680]  his idiot followers in the election not the McCain was any better it's all like
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.440]  a Don King fight they own both of me can't lose your Don King or the mafia
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.520]  and they're gonna thank you president when he was president like I can't wait
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:31.040]  to get my free car and house and Obama's going you're gonna get it and now
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:35.720]  they're back saying they're gonna get free goodies and he killed bin Laden didn't
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.280]  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Conan the destroyer was it Conan the barbarian
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.600]  he fights that big one-horned monster and rips it off it's real Arnold
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.600]  Schwarzenegger really lived 6,000 years ago in the Iborian age and really killed
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:54.520]  a 70-foot goblin sloth and I saw it on television I mean it's all real I mean
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.200]  I believe all of it let's finish up with Bill Clinton who in the
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:05.040]  dictionary next to the word liar they have his picture I mean telling us what
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.920]  a hero Obama is the guy that makes jokes about nobody can find his real
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.200]  birth certificate and he hides all his college records and high school records
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:17.320]  and admittedly had all these other fake names but it's supposed to be cutesy and
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:23.200]  funny let's go ahead and go back to Bill Clinton the fountain of truth here it
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:30.000]  is he took the harder and the more honorable path to find the Easter Bunny one
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:36.760]  that produced in my opinion the best result he killed Santa Claus which path
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:41.760]  with Mitt Romney have taken Mitt Romney criticized Barack Obama for vowing to
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:46.560]  strike al-qaeda targets inside Pakistan if necessary Roy is not worth moving
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:50.960]  heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.840]  he was referring to the hunt for Osama bin Laden what did he mean by that
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.960]  pause right there that was the old talking point back when Bush would say
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:02.080]  dead or alive and if five years later like where has been lot and he goes I
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:07.520]  don't care I'm not really worried about it remember that quote because back then
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:11.920]  the Democrats were threatening to release the info Madeline Albright look
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.000]  it up if you're a journalist out there I'm like I've got articles up at info
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.360]  wars.com and have links to it there's one called the 10 facts that prove
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.800]  bin Laden fables a contrived hoax at info wars.com and prison planet.com
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:27.840]  front page with video analysis that I added today with the links to Walter
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:32.360]  Cronkite Madeline Albright shank don't roll him out we know you've got him or
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:38.480]  we'll expose it so they waited until they had it and rolled out the lie
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.880]  alright I'm digressing just just finish up with it it's so ridiculous he was
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:47.640]  referring to the hunt for Osama bin Laden what did he mean by that because
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:52.440]  it's generated a little controversy given Osama bin Laden's role in killing
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:58.760]  with 3,000 Americans on 9-11 and coming down the chimney oh look at him looking
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:06.240]  out the window and that's what you hire a president to do you hire the president
[01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:10.880]  to make the calls when no one else can do like Ron Bowne the Treasury Secretary
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:17.360]  who got shot in the head you mean like him oh and it's the truth team wait now
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:22.320]  he's not changed he's the truth third he'll give you the truth I mean Obama
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:26.520]  never lies man wouldn't hire any lobbyist hired nothing but lobbyist would
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.080]  have the most open administration ever the most closed wouldn't have signing
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:33.440]  statements the most signing statements wouldn't use executive power he now
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.840]  said last week I can't wait to get reelected I'll do whatever I want with
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.200]  executive order ignore Congress make it go with some lies here go to your calls
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:47.040]  I mean I don't want that NDAA turns out he demanded up the bad parts and then
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.920]  said he wouldn't sign it and I said he would sign it I mean BLZ bub may lies
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:25:00.240]  like this I mean only liar better would be the devil in hell and maybe that's
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.560]  what the Obama administration is maybe maybe all these preachers freaking out
[01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.040]  of right maybe he is like his whole administration is like some
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.760]  pus-filled boil on Satan's rump or something you know what it's just got
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:19.960]  to end sometime okay let's let's start going Todd Bob Gene will Jamie

[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:38.040]  listening to you I just had an idea and it's this it's an illustration we're
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.320]  looking over Obama's shoulder as he's writing a list and it has Obama you
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:46.160]  know so I didn't say that you did it has Osama Osama exed out and underneath it
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:53.480]  it says the list was on the Darth Vader Voldemort and for property as these are
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:26:00.640]  mythical bad men are exed out his family got over five billion dollars in the two
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.960]  years after to build US military bases they're on the biggest destruction
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:08.200]  company in the Middle East his family's best friends with the bushes when air
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.040]  traffic was grounded for three days or 9-11 only been lawdons were allowed to
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.680]  fly it out of the country that's on record it's all staged guess where George
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:23.880]  Herbert Walker Bush was on the morning of 9-11 in DC yes you want to hear
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:28.400]  London Guardian Associated Press having breakfast with the head of the
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.280]  bin Laden family I'm sorry it's just too rich yes he ran security in the World
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.520]  Trade Centers and his contract was up September 10th so you have no liability

[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:55.160]  paradigm shipping T-shirts which addresses both sides of what I was up in
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.840]  like some like Obama killed the Kibler elves or something I mean that's as
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:05.480]  real as I took it back to God it would be it would be Obama Bush 2013 but as you
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.400]  get closer underneath the Obama Bush you would say cellmates oh my gosh that's
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.000]  pure genius I want to give that to the kid can I have that idea hey man it's

[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.120]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.080]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their

[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:01.120]  1-877-327-0365
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.920]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:21.640]  broadcasting network network
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:29.920]  sometimes I wake up late at night 3 4 in the morning and I asked my shelf why
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:33.480]  are you doing this you know the world's always been corrupt you know it's getting
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:38.080]  more corrupt why are you sticking your neck out a little voice in my head says
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:42.600]  back off a little don't be so hardcore don't go on the air and call the
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.280]  attorney general a murderer and then go over the evidence don't have cops on
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.920]  saying the FBI threatened to kill them in Oklahoma City if they talked about the
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:53.320]  bombs you know they killed cops and people you need to you know you know
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:56.160]  you've been threatened they've threatened to kill you and your family you
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:02.480]  need to you need to back off and then my overall spirit says no because we've
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:06.160]  got to stand against these people they're gonna wreck all of society my
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:10.880]  children have no future and no one's children have a future unless I get all
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.160]  in against this enemy because once you give into fear of what your neighbors
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:19.640]  think I mean imagine the general public how cowardly they are they won't even
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.520]  talk about politics or issues because they just want to see hey sports yeah
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.760]  about the weather oh saw you mojo lawn Bob and that's why our society's falling
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:32.680]  apart and so I know how real the new world order is you know I've been
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.480]  offered the jobs I've been offered Glenn Beck's job before Glenn Beck existed in
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:43.280]  media in his current incarnation I was told you'll be the big TV guy with the
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:46.600]  book should be the new Rush Limbaugh and I said oh you tell that to all the
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.280]  girls they're like no this was in three different groups over the years well as
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:55.040]  four total but the point is it's always the same you're gonna go nowhere on this
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.920]  crusade or you can be a star well let me tell you something I am now known
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.160]  worldwide I can go to any country and people hey Alex Jones all over the
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:09.080]  place I can hardly buy myself dinner in Austin Texas I can I can't walk my dog
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.920]  down the street without cars stopping and that is not who I'm a celebrity it's
[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:17.560]  wow we really have reached a lot of people and then it's like wow I've got a
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:22.840]  big responsibility to do a good job but when I think about the fact that they
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.640]  know the vaccines are causing an autoimmune response and causing gut
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.600]  fauna problems I've had all these top scientists on that they know it's
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:35.480]  causing chronic brain damage when I know that they you know full well the
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.600]  sodium fluoride's causing massive brain damage and bone cancer and IQ
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.880]  reduction in all their own government documents and then I find out it's a
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.120]  plan and the White House science are brags about it and wrote books on it in
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.680]  the 70s and I've got scientific American basically calling for it right here
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.000]  Royal Society calls for redistribution of wealth and more birth control to save
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:00.440]  planet just an excuse to grab power they don't care about the planet then I just
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:04.560]  think you know what it's that old human instinct for the men to defend against
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.000]  evil and so I'm doing what you're supposed to do that's why I'm fulfilled
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.400]  and I'm not worried I'm not really looking forward if they kill me or set me
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:18.080]  up or put me in a dungeon but somebody's got to fight these people's when you get
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.400]  a nation of cowards a nation of sheep they'll be ruled by a nation of wolves
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.080]  now I got to get to the calls to Bob and Michigan Gene will Jamie cell Henry
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:29.040]  Berry mr. Contreras that'll be it for calls but let's start going now Bob
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:33.240]  briefly in a minute or two tell folks what happened with your grandson what
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.560]  you heard what you discovered what you were able to do go ahead let me impress
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:42.680]  upon you folks out there the timetable two and a half years ago I stumbled upon
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.680]  your radio program two and a half years ago my daughter was having a baby I ran
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.440]  to her and I said I just heard something let's be careful she managed to say no
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:37:01.200]  to the HEP virus but when he was one day old he she managed to say no to the
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:10.040]  three months a wellness visit what a joke at the seven months my son-in-law
[01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.240]  bless his heart took him because he didn't know it's time to get your IQ
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.560]  reduction most children just get an IQ reduction some will be they're now saying
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.600]  a lot of you're gonna have seizures now this is part of the new freedom Billy
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:28.880]  may not talk again but it's healthy I'm sorry go ahead she came handy the baby
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:33.560]  at seven months was crying because of the inflammation in his gut and brain the
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:41.680]  next morning he woke up in convulsions and from that moment on we lost him we
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:50.560]  lost the soul in his eyes and this is happening when every 58 children if this
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:55.240]  rate continues in four years it'll be one out of ten but that's what that's a
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:58.200]  blessing no no no it was in the Associated Press two weeks ago they
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:02.160]  said you're supposed to have a convulsion now go get the shot they're
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:05.240]  gonna have a little convulsion centers at the schools and we'll all have
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.680]  convulsions together and the diabetes and neurological disorders 10,000 plus
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:14.920]  percent increase in pediatric cancer it's the blessing of the love of the
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:18.720]  eugenics and we have all the documents are doing on purpose the cancer viruses
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.400]  they add but but but instead of me you know getting off into a rant about that
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:28.120]  from one in 25,300 to one in 58 now and as you said in four to five years it
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:32.160]  will be one out of ten and then a few years later one out of two and then I
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:35.840]  mean this is a gift you're being given though by the loving government that
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.560]  openly says they want to kill you but but you're saying you were able to
[01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:42.800]  reverse some of this or did I misunderstand you I'm sorry thanks to you I
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.800]  went to 10 pennies website from 10 to me I went to medical doctor just carry
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:53.440]  10 penny yeah yeah yeah it took me to operas and rescue to Jenny McCarthy
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:59.480]  saying I found out that this could be taken care of yeah well I mean I mean I
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.640]  mean if they've had the gut inflammation because the virus is the stuff
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.640]  growing in there you know for five six years they're gonna be way behind but
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:11.280]  yeah there are a lot of things they can detox them exercising them the I'm not
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:15.600]  gonna give the stuff that doctors have said this to me the infrared treatments
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:21.680]  the sweating they're getting it out the probiotics no television all of that you
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:24.920]  can get them back and it's really freaking the system out that the body's so
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.000]  resilient that we're able to stop this course you know the Bill and Melinda
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.880]  Gates Foundation who are open to eugenics is you know they're the heaviest
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.720]  investors now in gut flora infection studies they're gonna give you the cure
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:39.120]  though give you the disease give you the does you hear an india alone this is
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:44.600]  mainstream news guys pull it up 46,000 plus children last year alone we're
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:51.200]  given paralysis polio by the bill by the Bill and Melinda Gates vaccine how's
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.240]  that sound for you in india polio is already gone sir sir they line them up
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.320]  you might as well line them up and machine gun them I'm sorry go ahead drop
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.760]  your football drop your baseball drop your Stanley Cup drop your series drop
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:08.040]  all that nonsense they're not going to do it most of them out there the new
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.000]  listeners their kids brain damage they'll thank the government and go watch
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.640]  TV well thank you for recovering my my grandson I appreciate it he's a lot
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:22.240]  he's alive but he still can't speak he lost his speaking ability at seven months
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:26.560]  but you were able to reverse a lot of that how much was reversed how much was
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:32.040]  reversed get a syllable out of his voice how much was reversed though we have him
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:38.120]  all the way he his speech he can't he can't speak yet it shut him down and see
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.720]  he has a 50% chance of never speaking again but see here's here's the plan and
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.440]  God bless you you notice now all the news has said it's very reasonable to kill
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:50.320]  babies up to three they plan to brain damage your kid and then say euthanize
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:53.720]  them and that's the eugenics plan look it up people are like you got to be
[01:40:53.720 --> 01:41:00.320]  kidding folks it's real okay government killed 262 mil last century that was
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:05.080]  just a warm-up let's go to gene in Texas gene what you think of that call well
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:10.160]  that was that was pretty pretty awesome that that guy had a remedy for that but
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.960]  you know when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the Lord's gonna
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.000]  lift up a standard against him and that's what this is all about getting
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.760]  this information out and also the heathen they imagine a vain thing you
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.640]  know I mean why do the heathen heathen rage and the kings of the earth they
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:35.080]  imagine a vain thing read that Psalms chapter 2 that speaks to our day no I
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:39.480]  was just reading that yesterday somebody posted it in the message forum yeah
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:43.500]  that's an awesome that's an awesome prophecy that's the Psalms is very
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:46.680]  prophetic you know I mean elites throughout history are totally insane
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:51.840]  on power trips every ancient society would demand firstborn sons to be
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.880]  sacrificed every culture well now they just sacrifice our sons with a chemical
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:02.680]  weapon they sacrifice their brains that's right I was I was listening
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:07.960]  listening to a fellow who was on your show a while back got a mark corner key
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.100]  and he was talking about internal exile you know in the in the Soviet Union you
[01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:16.600]  know in the 30s I think it was yeah they wouldn't let you travel basically
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:19.360]  outside of your house to your neighborhood and that's the new IRS
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.280]  passport law the TSA says you're not gonna be able to have a job drive your car
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:28.440]  unless the potbellies at the TSA say you can yeah and he also mentioned that
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:35.440]  about Molotov how that guy lived all throughout the whole thing I think he
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:40.360]  died yeah no everything we saw in the Soviet Union listen the federal
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:45.600]  government nine years ago hired former Soviet KGB and Marcus Wolfe the head of
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.640]  the Stasi on record this was in I heard this it didn't believe it and I went and
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:53.840]  looked it up the federal purchase orders they hired them to come set this up I
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:43:00.960]  mean that's why it looks just like that because they hired him to set it up right

[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.600]  day and then wrap their tyranny in American flags simultaneously will in
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:13.880]  Oklahoma we got to move quick we'll go Jamie shall Henry Barry and Michigan
[01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:17.200]  truther will you're on the air thanks for holding hey thanks for taking my
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:20.880]  call Alex just real quick to touch on what the caller to call to go was
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.680]  talking about with the vaccinations I just had a daughter born about three
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:28.400]  weeks ago and we're going through all that right now and I originally went to
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.480]  a establishment type doctor which basically shot down all the research that
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:37.720]  I bought to him and spoke to him about my concerns with no lie and tell you
[01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.680]  there's not mercury in it when it's on the insert you got a search vaccine free
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:46.400]  doctors in and then in the name of your area you'll find them go ahead I found a
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.120]  doctor on that website there's only two in the state of Oklahoma one of them
[01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:55.160]  jinx and I just went and saw him him this last week and basically said
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.680]  everything that I had studied and found through my own research and through
[01:48:58.680 --> 01:49:03.680]  listening to the show and it basically valid the government admits that over
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.800]  200 million Americans contracted cancer from the polio vaccine alone that's
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.840]  CDC this is not debatable I'm sorry go ahead oh I'm not and you're exactly right
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.600]  and the crazy thing was when we went to the establishment doctor I spoke about
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.200]  by Mirasol and some of the concerns I had with that and he basically said that
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.880]  it was just mercury based and that was actually basically kind of good for you
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:29.280]  and I mean it blew me away which is what led no that's a talking point have you
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:32.120]  heard me play the clip where CBS News says mercury is good for children's
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:35.720]  brains yeah oh yeah it was like a flashback when he told me that because
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.080]  I was like wow I just heard about this like a week ago on the show all we do is
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.920]  repeat what these psychopaths say and the only reason we were doing this is I'm
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:47.800]  trying to get my girlfriend who's really not awake yet to come at least to you
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:51.760]  know see you know what we're up against and yeah well here's an example
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.560]  California court has an epidemic of whooping cough that's there were a
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:58.200]  couple hundred cases and then it came out in the news but back of the paper it
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.280]  was the kids that it had the shot the shot was giving it to him my mother
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:07.240]  triathlete never gets sick she took a flu shot because the triathlon folks like
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.240]  the decade ago said do it you want to stay you know really good for this
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.320]  coming up in a month she almost she was sick for a month from it okay
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.360]  everybody you know but then at the studies show if you take the vaccine an
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:23.440]  average flu shot it doubles your chances of getting the flu next three shots and
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:26.680]  you double your chances of getting Alzheimer's look it up I appreciate your
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:32.680]  call and you you folks you cannot make up the magnitude of this okay look I just
[01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:36.280]  read to you top scientist you know Reuters says reduced population they're
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:40.800]  already doing it it's funny to them you know about all the medical experiments
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.400]  on the troops they're doing it to us okay it's a death sentence the entire US
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:49.560]  military takes decades off their life the DU be better to smoke 10 packs of
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.840]  camels every day and drink Jack Daniels statistically I've had top scientists
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.200]  on the DU is a death sentence and they have a musette they didn't until 1990
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.560]  because they don't care anymore psychos are in control you can say what you
[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:06.280]  wanted about our government pre-1990 but they really got evil after that let's
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:10.960]  go ahead and talk to Jamie in Canada let's move quick go ahead hi Alex you're
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:16.440]  a bulldog man I love you love you I wanted to bring some near-tension there
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:22.000]  was a how film I watched it was called House of Numbers I don't know if you've
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.840]  ever heard of it I haven't haven't definitely watch it I call it the loose
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:33.200]  change of the AIDS virus or the AIDS epidemic if you watch this thing I was
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:38.240]  really blown away by it because it basically shows that HIV's been kind of
[01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:43.560]  marketed from both the 1980 on as you know it's it's a cover for a wide
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:48.440]  spectrum bio attacks but I just I just clicked on it actually found it it was
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:54.040]  playing it yeah House of Numbers calm my dad in the late 80s was like show me
[01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:57.480]  medical documents and stuff he's a physician about how it was all made up
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:02.240]  and I knew that then it's a totally made up go ahead these people they're
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:07.640]  diagnosed with HIV they get the scare of their life that stresses them out and
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:10.760]  they kill you with chemotherapy drugs yeah they shoot them up basically it's
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.360]  the same as cancer if you know exactly but but you notice I've never seen the
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.720]  film but already know what's in it because it's totally true it's a race
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:23.040]  there are some race specific viruses separate from HIV that are designed for
[01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:25.800]  Africans and we have the government documents that's why you've got African
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:28.360]  countries would have the population they've been medical studies where the
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:32.880]  girls have never had sex but they've had a vaccine they give them a bio weapon
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:37.240]  kill them but also have HIV in it to say that's what's killing them see it's a
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:41.240]  cover it's a bit and some argue it's a binary weapon as well I appreciate your
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:46.440]  call great points gee let's go to a Sal in Oklahoma Sal you're on the air hey
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:49.800]  Alex it's a pleasure to talk with you pleasure to talk to you brother go
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:55.200]  ahead hey I just wanted to really make this point and hope that you can
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:00.240]  emphasize on this there's gonna be a false flag attack in Chicago this month
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:04.920]  you really need to do the research because all the information is there and
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:09.920]  it's I mean I'm sure on the high we may stop them from the false flag yes it
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:13.160]  leaked from the Red Cross they're preparing for the evacuation of Chicago
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:17.360]  that CBS news we covered it all last week you must have missed it and yes
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:20.640]  they've they've got martial law prepared but that doesn't mean they're gonna pull
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:25.360]  the trigger you understand yeah well not just that I mean if you look at all the
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:29.520]  propaganda movies and stuff it's all Chicago plus well I know that Larry
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:34.600]  Silverstein on the World Trade Center did by the Sears tower so they
[01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:40.280]  certainly move the G8 which was supposed to be there that's David yeah they
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:44.000]  moved it there but they're still gonna go through with the G20 there and that's
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.640]  where the attack's gonna be I'm sure of it the it's all there and that's why
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:53.320]  they're moving just the fast so they can censor the web after the fall I hear
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:56.760]  you Sal that's what they're getting the cybersecurity in place they admit to
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:01.840]  shut down the web or redirect it that's all happening I said they were I said
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.440]  they were gonna blow up I appreciate your call I said they were gonna blow up the
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:08.240]  World Trade Center before 9-11 I said they do it the next two months they
[01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:12.120]  blame it on Ben Lawton so I understand you know when you can see the pieces
[01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:16.120]  going together and I think Chicago is Ron Paul we talked to Ron Paul as he said
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:19.640]  he's worried about false flag in Chicago but because we're talking about it they
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.400]  may back off okay that's all I'm saying so get the word out good job Henry in
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:29.840]  Canada go we're lost in your dorms get possible get past so to you what's on
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.800]  your mind I'm just sitting in the kitchen here chopping up some dandelion
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.840]  root from the garden good for what else yeah that sounds al-Qaeda-ish yep that's
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:44.400]  good for digestion isn't it I just stuff's getting pretty real here it's
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.000]  also getting kind of twilight zone I just posted the coroner story on my
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:54.280]  Facebook so who knows I might be next because I think they'll get me and Ron
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:57.520]  Paul long before you but we're so visible maybe not that's what Jim Garrison
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:01.800]  taught us what's on your mind they got some dirt on me I'm a bad man I give
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.040]  food to a homeless guy the other day well they're banning that everywhere you
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.640]  don't do that yeah they might take me up in one of those crappy Sea King
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.800]  helicopters owned by Larry Silverstein I appreciate your call we're gonna jump
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.040]  now who's up next here I want to get everybody before we end like I said I
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:21.240]  would Barry in Texas you're on the air go ahead
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.280]  so I'm sorry to go and just real quick I'll be lighting fast here I can speak
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:27.760]  real quickly to the call about the police pulling people over in the
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:32.640]  university yes I used to do that job basically a security officers on
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:37.320]  campuses are acting as agents of the property owner yes so it's a private
[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:40.480]  property issue but if it's a state college I know that's been thrown out in
[01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:44.480]  court correct right yes exactly there's no fourth amendment when it's private
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.480]  security because they don't they're not agents of the government they're private
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:51.920]  citizens and they're using a citizen's arrest power correct correct exactly but
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.640]  basically the question shouldn't be kind of pull you over the question be what
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:58.400]  cash do you have to pull over because what the consequences of not pulling over
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:01.120]  basically you could just leave their property and they no longer have authority
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.360]  over you at that point but don't be surprised if they give you trespass
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.640]  warning you're not allowed back on the property the reason I was called
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.320]  the quickies I'm a I'm a government employee down and I received an email from
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:15.920]  the AFGE American Federation government employees yes and they're basically
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:19.920]  asking us to fill out a survey to tell them who we think they should support
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:24.200]  they're gonna support one of the two candidates they said Romney or Obama I
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:27.920]  basically responded with the with essentially like a manifesto telling
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:31.000]  them you know all the different reasons basically like a text version of the
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.960]  Obama deception your movie how Obama's committee trees and how Romney is so
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:39.120]  much like him it's almost like the same person and basically telling them that
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:43.400]  we should support Ron Paul and that sent that back to him I it's just one
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:47.680]  email they're gonna get but it felt good to at least give you Ron Paul he just
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:51.560]  won two more states he won all the first states that's now been admitted he
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:56.400]  would have been the guy they cheated him but again we run we show there's fraud
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.560]  we educate but it shows we're winning that they had to steal it from him
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.080]  people are bummed out about that no they shouldn't be bummed out because he's
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:09.240]  really the winner it shows we're winning let's talk to Michigan truth or you got
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:13.960]  30 seconds on the show's over go ahead Alex greetings from Grand Rapids
