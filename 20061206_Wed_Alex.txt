[00:00.000 --> 00:11.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:11.640 --> 00:12.640]  You want answers?
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.640]  Well, so does he.
[00:14.640 --> 00:19.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:19.000 --> 00:29.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.000 --> 00:36.400]  Welcome, it is December 6th, 2006.
[00:36.400 --> 00:39.800]  We will be live for the next three hours.
[00:39.800 --> 00:45.840]  We have Dr. Nick Begich joining us to talk about all of the declassified and patented
[00:45.840 --> 00:55.560]  admissions of mind control and ongoing mind control operations, both passive and captive
[00:55.560 --> 01:00.720]  here in the United States and worldwide, and then Pastor Butch Paul joins us.
[01:00.720 --> 01:06.200]  Coming up to talk about a report that came out in their mainstream news, and they got
[01:06.200 --> 01:10.560]  some documents associated with it, how they're retina scanning and thumb scanning the school
[01:10.560 --> 01:11.560]  children.
[01:11.560 --> 01:13.560]  I have about 30 pages of documents here.
[01:13.560 --> 01:14.560]  He has over 1,000.
[01:14.560 --> 01:15.960]  He couldn't fax them all to me.
[01:15.960 --> 01:16.960]  He was offering to.
[01:16.960 --> 01:18.460]  I said, no, don't worry about it.
[01:18.460 --> 01:19.460]  But I've got the 30 pages.
[01:19.460 --> 01:22.360]  I'm trying to read over them right now.
[01:22.360 --> 01:26.600]  And guess who's running the program to buy what we scan your children in?
[01:26.600 --> 01:34.480]  Ah, yes, a government department that deals with human experimentation and testing.
[01:34.480 --> 01:37.000]  Same folks that brought you eugenics.
[01:37.000 --> 01:40.080]  So it all ties together with both guests today.
[01:40.080 --> 01:47.280]  We'll also have open phones in this first hour and with both of our guests today.
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.520]  Flatulence, not turbulence, forces plane landing in Nashville.
[01:51.520 --> 01:54.200]  This is out of the Tennesseean.
[01:54.200 --> 01:58.440]  Flatulence brought 99 passengers on an American Airlines flight to an unscheduled visit to
[01:58.440 --> 02:00.600]  Nashville early Monday morning.
[02:00.600 --> 02:02.560]  We're now learning the details.
[02:02.560 --> 02:06.000]  The woman was in the bathroom and did what old folks do.
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.800]  They like to be friendly and strike a match so the next person doesn't have to smell the
[02:10.800 --> 02:20.200]  methane gases that are produced in the intestines lower and, well, they're in the large and
[02:20.200 --> 02:22.840]  small intestine.
[02:22.840 --> 02:25.640]  And they landed the plane and they're considering charging her.
[02:25.640 --> 02:27.040]  They're not charging her at this time.
[02:27.040 --> 02:30.400]  You can have matches, but striking them is illegal.
[02:30.400 --> 02:31.400]  And so everyone panicked.
[02:31.400 --> 02:39.400]  And of course, they found out that she wasn't LCIA about to attack.
[02:39.400 --> 02:41.160]  And that dovetails with this report.
[02:41.160 --> 02:46.600]  Police told me my cricket ball was a potentially lethal weapon, a middle class businessman.
[02:46.600 --> 02:49.880]  No criminal record in his suit.
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.160]  He was leaving work going to cricket practice with a ball in his hand because he said he
[02:55.160 --> 02:57.360]  was practicing throwing and spinning.
[02:57.360 --> 03:02.640]  And I don't really know the game of cricket, but he was practicing with it in his hand.
[03:02.640 --> 03:03.640]  That's why he had it.
[03:03.640 --> 03:06.960]  And he was walking up the escalator to the tube station with the ball in his hand.
[03:06.960 --> 03:12.920]  And he got ticketed and interrogated and, well, this is the new world order.
[03:12.920 --> 03:14.280]  Everything is a crime.
[03:14.280 --> 03:16.880]  All of us are treated like five-year-old children.
[03:16.880 --> 03:22.600]  All of us are prodded and poked by low IQ, low grade morons that have shined up so they
[03:22.600 --> 03:28.560]  can engage in their control freak fantasies for the larger government whose open plan
[03:28.560 --> 03:33.640]  is to set up a worldwide police state, one-shot policies for psychological testing, drugging,
[03:33.640 --> 03:35.880]  total destruction of the nation state.
[03:35.880 --> 03:41.160]  And all these idiots that push world government, the low-level minions who, well, I'm a citizen
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.160]  of the world.
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.160]  It's trendy.
[03:43.160 --> 03:47.960]  America says she is, you're a man without a country then.
[03:47.960 --> 03:51.360]  You're a woman without a country because this new world order is about taking your bill
[03:51.360 --> 03:53.840]  of rights, taking your national sovereignty.
[03:53.840 --> 04:00.240]  It's about making you being basically a chattel, flotsam and jetsam being born on the global
[04:00.240 --> 04:03.240]  tides of the new world.
[04:03.240 --> 04:04.240]  But you get it.
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.840]  Well, then, just be ready.
[04:05.840 --> 04:08.440]  See how far it gets you.
[04:08.440 --> 04:16.920]  Yes, that trendiness won't put food on your table or, as Bush says, food on your family.
[04:16.920 --> 04:17.920]  But again, you're trendy.
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.000]  You've got it all figured out.
[04:21.000 --> 04:22.000]  So we'll get into that report.
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.200]  Also, a huge article out by Paul Watson dealing with our interview yesterday.
[04:26.200 --> 04:35.080]  Ex-agent CIA seed money helped launch Google and he fingered the head point man for the
[04:35.080 --> 04:40.440]  Google CIA operation.
[04:40.440 --> 04:41.440]  So that's up on prisonplanet.com.
[04:41.440 --> 04:47.040]  We'll be recapping that in case you missed the interview yesterday.
[04:47.040 --> 04:50.960]  The Iraq study group has not just published its preliminary findings as it did two weeks
[04:50.960 --> 04:51.960]  ago.
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.480]  Now, the complete report has been issued and surprise, surprise, it recommends absolute
[04:56.480 --> 05:08.680]  escalation of the war.
[05:08.680 --> 05:20.800]  I was a highwayman along the coast roads I did ride with sword and pistol by my side.
[05:20.800 --> 05:45.800]  I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide, I was a sailor, I was a sailor, I was a sailor,
[05:45.800 --> 05:55.800]  I was born upon the tide, with the sea I did buy.
[05:55.800 --> 06:05.000]  I sailed a school around the horn of Mexico, I went along the furlough and made some little
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.000]  blows.
[06:06.000 --> 06:20.000]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed, but I am living still.
[06:20.000 --> 06:30.000]  I was a damn building across the river deep and wide, we're stealing water, didn't
[06:30.000 --> 06:48.800]  the force of my life pass on?
[06:48.800 --> 06:51.800]  But I'm still around.
[06:51.800 --> 06:54.800]  I'll always be around.
[06:54.800 --> 06:57.800]  Actually, it's a gentleman's lab that you have tuned in.
[06:57.800 --> 07:02.800]  We're now nine minutes, 58 seconds into this first hour.
[07:02.800 --> 07:05.800]  Two big guests coming up for you today, Pastor Butch-Paw,
[07:05.800 --> 07:09.800]  talk about the human experimentation program
[07:09.800 --> 07:12.800]  that the federal government involved in the biometric scanning
[07:12.800 --> 07:16.800]  and retina scanning of your children.
[07:16.800 --> 07:20.800]  We have the documents and Dovetails with it.
[07:20.800 --> 07:23.800]  Our first guest in the second hour will be Dr. Nick Baggich
[07:23.800 --> 07:26.800]  on his new Mind Control book and his new Mind Control video,
[07:26.800 --> 07:29.800]  all off of open source documentation.
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.800]  This is all admitted and there's massive Mind Control programs
[07:33.800 --> 07:37.800]  going on at multiple levels publicly against us right now
[07:37.800 --> 07:39.800]  that is not hidden.
[07:39.800 --> 07:41.800]  Much of it is not hidden.
[07:41.800 --> 07:45.800]  It is hidden in plain view, as they say.
[07:45.800 --> 07:49.800]  But right now, let's get into the war
[07:49.800 --> 07:53.800]  here in the great adventure of fighting the globalist.
[07:53.800 --> 07:56.800]  Now, if you really listen to what Democrats had to say
[07:56.800 --> 08:00.800]  and then kind of the bridge between the two parties,
[08:00.800 --> 08:03.800]  the two mafias that work for the larger mafia bosses
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.800]  globally above them,
[08:05.800 --> 08:08.800]  it's basically what McCain has been saying.
[08:08.800 --> 08:12.800]  We have to build up for a build down.
[08:12.800 --> 08:15.800]  And that's actually the Pentagon public strategy,
[08:15.800 --> 08:17.800]  that is their propaganda.
[08:17.800 --> 08:20.800]  For two and a half plus years, they've been saying,
[08:20.800 --> 08:22.800]  oh, we'll be out in a few years.
[08:22.800 --> 08:27.800]  We just have to increase troops and train the Iraqi brigades
[08:27.800 --> 08:29.800]  before we can leave.
[08:29.800 --> 08:31.800]  And so now they know that you're onto their fraud,
[08:31.800 --> 08:34.800]  onto their lie, and so you're demanding the troops be removed.
[08:34.800 --> 08:37.800]  And they're saying, okay, we failed.
[08:37.800 --> 08:39.800]  We were losing the war.
[08:39.800 --> 08:41.800]  You're right. We're listening to you.
[08:41.800 --> 08:43.800]  We're doing what you've asked.
[08:43.800 --> 08:45.800]  We're going to put it into a process now,
[08:45.800 --> 08:47.800]  an independent process,
[08:47.800 --> 08:51.800]  with James Baker and Robert Gates and Bush Sr.
[08:51.800 --> 08:53.800]  and everybody else.
[08:53.800 --> 08:56.800]  And they're going to come in and publicly spank Georgie Boy
[08:56.800 --> 08:59.800]  and Georgie Porgy put in pie.
[08:59.800 --> 09:01.800]  And boy, we've listened to you.
[09:01.800 --> 09:03.800]  And it's the same process they've been pushing
[09:03.800 --> 09:06.800]  for two and a half years.
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.800]  Again, they just have a big debate and say,
[09:08.800 --> 09:10.800]  boy, we heard what you said.
[09:10.800 --> 09:13.800]  And the Iraq study group's recommendation
[09:13.800 --> 09:15.800]  is to pull the troops out.
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.800]  And then they go on to say,
[09:17.800 --> 09:19.800]  it's kind of like a contract where there's the big print
[09:19.800 --> 09:21.800]  at the top and then you read the little bitty print.
[09:21.800 --> 09:23.800]  You can get out your huge magnifying glass
[09:23.800 --> 09:25.800]  and it says the opposite.
[09:25.800 --> 09:28.800]  But the big print says, we're going to pull the troops out.
[09:28.800 --> 09:31.800]  And Bush can make it look like it has validity.
[09:31.800 --> 09:33.800]  I mean, it's theater, folks. They play a theater.
[09:33.800 --> 09:36.800]  It comes out and says, I don't like this recommendation.
[09:36.800 --> 09:39.800]  At first, it doesn't need to keep troops.
[09:39.800 --> 09:42.800]  And I'm a little angry about this.
[09:42.800 --> 09:45.800]  And you see how this works.
[09:45.800 --> 09:47.800]  And then what does it actually say?
[09:47.800 --> 09:49.800]  We're going to pull the troops out
[09:49.800 --> 09:52.800]  after we put 20,000 to 30,000 more in
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.800]  and train the 18 groups of Iraqi National Guard.
[09:58.800 --> 10:00.800]  And they've only effectively trained two
[10:00.800 --> 10:02.800]  and they never intend to train them.
[10:02.800 --> 10:03.800]  And they're building permanent bases
[10:03.800 --> 10:04.800]  in the actual Pentagon documents
[10:04.800 --> 10:06.800]  that if you want to go dig them up or available,
[10:06.800 --> 10:09.800]  say we will be there in 20 plus years
[10:09.800 --> 10:11.800]  with a contingent built down
[10:11.800 --> 10:14.800]  when they're finally done of about 30,000 U.S. troops
[10:14.800 --> 10:17.800]  garrisoned in armored compounds
[10:17.800 --> 10:19.800]  running the genocide operations.
[10:19.800 --> 10:22.800]  And in 20 years at current extermination rates,
[10:22.800 --> 10:27.800]  so it's 600 plus thousand in three and a half years,
[10:27.800 --> 10:30.800]  you will see only about half
[10:30.800 --> 10:33.800]  of the Iraqi population left that's currently there.
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.800]  The extermination operations killed 2.15 million
[10:36.800 --> 10:39.800]  conservatively in the last 16 years.
[10:39.800 --> 10:41.800]  Now they've stepped up the extermination.
[10:41.800 --> 10:44.800]  And but it'll be a minor footnote.
[10:44.800 --> 10:46.800]  I mean, it may end up where, you know,
[10:46.800 --> 10:49.800]  some swored robotic armored unit,
[10:49.800 --> 10:51.800]  which they already have in places
[10:51.800 --> 10:54.800]  cracking down the last Iraqi who's shot in the back
[10:54.800 --> 10:55.800]  and falls down bleeding.
[10:55.800 --> 10:58.800]  And there'll be a big battle command victory
[10:58.800 --> 10:59.800]  in America.
[10:59.800 --> 11:01.800]  Homeland base scores another hit
[11:01.800 --> 11:04.800]  against the Islamofascist threat.
[11:04.800 --> 11:07.800]  The big, huge potbellied new order minions
[11:07.800 --> 11:10.800]  will sit in their houses looking at huge plasma screen,
[11:10.800 --> 11:12.800]  you know, drinking, beer, eating pizza.
[11:12.800 --> 11:15.800]  Yeah, feeling physically powerful as if, you know,
[11:15.800 --> 11:17.800]  by the extermination they've gotten
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.800]  some type of great victory.
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.800]  I mean, that's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.800]  And of course, I'm trying to lead it to its absurd extreme,
[11:25.800 --> 11:30.800]  but I mean, 2.15 million down, 2.15 million.
[11:30.800 --> 11:37.800]  I mean, just the 1.5, 150,000 is quite a piece of change.
[11:37.800 --> 11:45.800]  Yeah, 2 million, 150,000 plus dead and counting.
[11:45.800 --> 11:46.800]  Great job.
[11:46.800 --> 11:47.800]  New World Order.
[11:47.800 --> 11:49.800]  Total precision.
[11:49.800 --> 11:51.800]  But no, they haven't failed.
[11:51.800 --> 11:54.800]  They haven't screwed up an Iraq.
[11:54.800 --> 11:56.800]  There's a little concern by the Pentagon
[11:56.800 --> 11:58.800]  that they've overcooked the cake, as I say.
[11:58.800 --> 12:00.800]  They meant to break it in three parts.
[12:00.800 --> 12:03.800]  They meant to have sectarian and religious war and strife.
[12:03.800 --> 12:05.800]  That's the strategy of tension and balkanization,
[12:05.800 --> 12:07.800]  divide and conquer for the entire region.
[12:07.800 --> 12:11.800]  Pentagon Document 2002 is really an original plan.
[12:11.800 --> 12:15.800]  1983, it's been major Israeli papers.
[12:15.800 --> 12:17.800]  There is a concern that they wanted to bake the cake,
[12:17.800 --> 12:20.800]  and that's balkanization, mass murder, extermination.
[12:20.800 --> 12:23.800]  But it's a little, it's overcooking it
[12:23.800 --> 12:26.800]  and breaking down even faster than they wanted.
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.800]  It's a little embarrassing to have hundreds of thousands
[12:29.800 --> 12:33.800]  being killed a year, so they want to get it off the front pages
[12:33.800 --> 12:36.800]  and put it into some type of procedural debate
[12:36.800 --> 12:40.800]  and depoliticize it where the Democrats were all hating the war,
[12:40.800 --> 12:42.800]  mainly just to hate Bush,
[12:42.800 --> 12:46.800]  because they didn't hate it when Clinton was doing the same thing.
[12:46.800 --> 12:50.800]  In fact, almost a million of that 2.15 million died
[12:50.800 --> 12:51.800]  under his eight-year watch.
[12:51.800 --> 12:53.800]  Remember Madeleine Albright?
[12:53.800 --> 12:56.800]  We had 700 plus thousand dead Iraqis,
[12:56.800 --> 12:58.800]  500,000 of them children.
[12:58.800 --> 13:00.800]  Is that a good price to pay for stability?
[13:00.800 --> 13:02.800]  And she said on NBC, she said, yes, it's a,
[13:02.800 --> 13:04.800]  we ought to find that clip.
[13:04.800 --> 13:07.800]  We got a YouTube Madeleine Albright,
[13:07.800 --> 13:08.800]  good price to pay,
[13:08.800 --> 13:10.800]  dead Iraqis, good price to pay, it should pop up.
[13:10.800 --> 13:12.800]  So folks can hear that again.
[13:12.800 --> 13:14.800]  I've got it somewhere here in the office.
[13:14.800 --> 13:15.800]  It's having trouble finding it.
[13:15.800 --> 13:16.800]  I was trying to find it the other day and couldn't.
[13:16.800 --> 13:17.800]  Do you have it out there, listeners?
[13:17.800 --> 13:19.800]  Would you mail us a copy if you do?
[13:19.800 --> 13:21.800]  I bet one of you does right now.
[13:21.800 --> 13:24.800]  I do honor our request and dig out that stuff and send it to us.
[13:24.800 --> 13:28.800]  So, you know, they don't even joke about it.
[13:28.800 --> 13:30.800]  I mean, they just openly admit it.
[13:30.800 --> 13:32.800]  They make no bones.
[13:32.800 --> 13:33.800]  It's a good price to pay.
[13:33.800 --> 13:35.800]  Half of middle kids, you know.
[13:35.800 --> 13:37.800]  That was in 97.
[13:37.800 --> 13:39.800]  Here we are, what, six, seven, eight years later,
[13:39.800 --> 13:44.800]  and the enjoyment has only intensified.
[13:44.800 --> 13:46.800]  So on the heels of that,
[13:46.800 --> 13:49.800]  it's not enough to have the quote independent group,
[13:49.800 --> 13:52.800]  the Iraq study group appointed by Bush.
[13:52.800 --> 13:53.800]  It's very independent.
[13:53.800 --> 13:55.800]  And now we have to have the Democrats line up,
[13:55.800 --> 13:58.800]  from Hillary, to Schumer, to Lieberman,
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.800]  to Representative Sylvester Reyes,
[14:04.800 --> 14:07.800]  leading Democrat wants more troops in Iraq.
[14:07.800 --> 14:10.800]  This is Newsweek in a surprise.
[14:10.800 --> 14:14.800]  Oh, it's so surprising.
[14:14.800 --> 14:17.800]  There'll be no investigations, no abolishing Patriot Act,
[14:17.800 --> 14:19.800]  no abolishing Military Commissions Act.
[14:19.800 --> 14:22.800]  And when Hillary gets in, or another Democrat,
[14:22.800 --> 14:24.800]  the very Democrats you know that hate Bush
[14:24.800 --> 14:26.800]  and are against the Military Commissions Act,
[14:26.800 --> 14:31.800]  will turn to you and say that either the powers don't exist now,
[14:31.800 --> 14:34.800]  or that they need them to fight the militias.
[14:34.800 --> 14:36.800]  Oh, it's going to be bad.
[14:36.800 --> 14:39.800]  That's why we need to break their conditioning now.
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.800]  Those that are listening, before you go under the mass mind control
[14:42.800 --> 14:44.800]  of the coffee and tea parties you have,
[14:44.800 --> 14:47.800]  with your other cyborg liberal friends,
[14:47.800 --> 14:51.800]  you know, you're a den of un-American scum.
[14:51.800 --> 14:53.800]  If you go along with wars, and you go,
[14:53.800 --> 14:56.800]  I don't see it isn't, I was against the war
[14:56.800 --> 14:58.800]  when they attacked Serbia.
[14:58.800 --> 15:00.800]  You see, and I was against the sanctions,
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.800]  and I'm against all, I'll be the same today and tomorrow,
[15:05.800 --> 15:07.800]  and I was the same a month ago, as I was five years ago,
[15:07.800 --> 15:10.800]  because I know the new war plan, it's just common sense.
[15:10.800 --> 15:12.800]  So I'm begging Democrats out there,
[15:12.800 --> 15:15.800]  I'm begging you, please.
[15:15.800 --> 15:17.800]  They're passing the torch now.
[15:17.800 --> 15:19.800]  They're passing the baton of the Democrats.
[15:19.800 --> 15:21.800]  They're going to intensify the agenda.
[15:21.800 --> 15:23.800]  Please stay awake.
[15:23.800 --> 15:25.800]  Please.
[15:25.800 --> 15:29.800]  Please don't let them neutralize you doing this,
[15:29.800 --> 15:31.800]  as the Republicans were neutralized
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.800]  in fighting the globalist when Bush was put in.
[15:33.800 --> 15:36.800]  Just the double team continues.
[15:36.800 --> 15:39.800]  Leading Democrat wants more troops in Iraq
[15:39.800 --> 15:43.800]  in a surprise twist in the debate over Iraq.
[15:43.800 --> 15:46.800]  Representative Sylvester Reyes,
[15:46.800 --> 15:49.800]  suckering Suckatash, soon to be
[15:49.800 --> 15:51.800]  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,
[15:51.800 --> 15:53.800]  said he wants to see an increase
[15:53.800 --> 15:55.800]  of 20,000 to 30,000 troops.
[15:55.800 --> 15:57.800]  Again, he just parrots what McCain and Bush say.
[15:57.800 --> 16:00.800]  U.S. troops as part of a step-up effort
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.800]  to dismantle the militias
[16:02.800 --> 16:04.800]  when all of the internal CIA reports
[16:04.800 --> 16:06.800]  that have now been made public,
[16:06.800 --> 16:08.800]  said that our presence makes it worse.
[16:08.800 --> 16:10.800]  Add some fuel to that fire.
[16:10.800 --> 16:12.800]  Throw a big old yule log on there,
[16:12.800 --> 16:14.800]  which is our troops.
[16:14.800 --> 16:16.800]  The soft-spoken Texas Democrat
[16:16.800 --> 16:18.800]  was an early opponent of the Iraq War
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.800]  and voted against October 2002
[16:22.800 --> 16:24.800]  resolution authorizing President Bush
[16:24.800 --> 16:26.800]  to invade that country.
[16:26.800 --> 16:29.800]  And it says that Dover's record got prominently cited
[16:29.800 --> 16:32.800]  last week when Speaker-designant Nancy Pelosi
[16:32.800 --> 16:35.800]  chose Reyes as the new head of the Intelligence Panel.
[16:35.800 --> 16:37.800]  But in an interview with Newsweek on Tuesday,
[16:37.800 --> 16:39.800]  Reyes
[16:39.800 --> 16:42.800]  potently distanced himself
[16:42.800 --> 16:44.800]  from many of the Democratic colleagues
[16:44.800 --> 16:46.800]  who have called for fixed timetables
[16:46.800 --> 16:48.800]  and withdrawal of U.S. troops.
[16:48.800 --> 16:51.800]  You took your 30 pieces of silver, didn't you?
[16:51.800 --> 16:53.800]  Yeah, now that blood's on your hands.
[16:53.800 --> 16:56.800]  You're now a murderer, too, Reyes.
[16:56.800 --> 16:58.800]  We'll be right back.
[16:58.800 --> 17:01.800]  We'll be right back.
[17:28.800 --> 17:33.800]  Sun down on the Union.
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.800]  Sun down on the Union.
[17:36.800 --> 17:39.800]  And what was made in the USA
[17:39.800 --> 17:42.800]  was a massive development.
[17:42.800 --> 17:45.800]  A massive development for 9-11 Truth.
[17:45.800 --> 17:47.800]  It just took place.
[17:47.800 --> 17:50.800]  My thanks to the loose change commandos
[17:50.800 --> 17:53.800]  who called our office to let us know about this
[17:53.800 --> 17:55.800]  and just sent us the video clip.
[17:55.800 --> 17:58.800]  But with comments going to be uploading it to the web
[17:58.800 --> 18:01.800]  in the next hour, you will be able to see it
[18:01.800 --> 18:05.800]  up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[18:05.800 --> 18:09.800]  We're getting an emergency report out on this right now.
[18:09.800 --> 18:13.800]  David Lynch, who is a huge director
[18:13.800 --> 18:16.800]  in Hollywood and television.
[18:16.800 --> 18:19.800]  I mean, we tried to list all the films
[18:19.800 --> 18:22.800]  and movies he's made.
[18:22.800 --> 18:25.800]  We have about Twin Peaks, the TV shows.
[18:25.800 --> 18:29.800]  Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, Wild at Heart,
[18:29.800 --> 18:33.800]  Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire.
[18:33.800 --> 18:35.800]  Unbelievable.
[18:35.800 --> 18:39.800]  He has gone public on 9-11.
[18:39.800 --> 18:43.800]  I think this is great news
[18:43.800 --> 18:46.800]  because it will just get more people who are on the fence
[18:46.800 --> 18:49.800]  that know it's an inside job to speak out.
[18:49.800 --> 18:52.800]  And he was interviewed, I guess they kept it quiet
[18:52.800 --> 18:54.800]  for Dutch TV.
[18:54.800 --> 18:56.800]  And the loose change boys didn't know about it
[18:56.800 --> 18:58.800]  until they were just sent the clip.
[18:58.800 --> 19:00.800]  They were interviewed for it and they played it,
[19:00.800 --> 19:02.800]  I guess, part of the loose change on Dutch television.
[19:02.800 --> 19:05.800]  I bet Queen Beatrix really loved that.
[19:05.800 --> 19:09.800]  Man, look, it's like a major touchdown
[19:09.800 --> 19:11.800]  getting scored here.
[19:11.800 --> 19:13.800]  It spiked the ball right now.
[19:13.800 --> 19:16.800]  This is fabulous because I know so many.
[19:16.800 --> 19:19.800]  I don't know so many, I guess.
[19:19.800 --> 19:22.800]  I know probably 30 or 40 Hollywood people,
[19:22.800 --> 19:25.800]  some of them huge, as big as they get.
[19:25.800 --> 19:27.800]  And they all know about 9-11.
[19:27.800 --> 19:30.800]  And then they all tell me everybody they know about 9-11.
[19:30.800 --> 19:32.800]  So that's how I come to the statement on CNN
[19:32.800 --> 19:34.800]  that hundreds are awake.
[19:34.800 --> 19:36.800]  Because I'll be talking to some famous person
[19:36.800 --> 19:38.800]  and they go, how many people know?
[19:38.800 --> 19:40.800]  Oh, we all know. He knows, she knows.
[19:40.800 --> 19:42.800]  Oh, really? You have discussions?
[19:42.800 --> 19:44.800]  Oh, yeah.
[19:44.800 --> 19:46.800]  It's amazing.
[19:46.800 --> 19:48.800]  Only Charlie Sheen, though, had the courage
[19:48.800 --> 19:50.800]  to hit that barbed wire first.
[19:50.800 --> 19:52.800]  I mean, Dean Haglund had the courage.
[19:52.800 --> 19:55.800]  He's been in a lot of big TV shows and in some movies.
[19:55.800 --> 19:58.800]  But, you know, he's not as big as, obviously,
[19:58.800 --> 20:00.800]  somebody like Charlie Sheen.
[20:00.800 --> 20:05.800]  He's been eclipsed by him, but just, oh,
[20:05.800 --> 20:07.800]  feels good. I'm having adrenaline.
[20:07.800 --> 20:09.800]  I'm having endorphin.
[20:09.800 --> 20:11.800]  My brain, see, I don't need to use drugs, folks.
[20:11.800 --> 20:13.800]  When you do the right thing,
[20:13.800 --> 20:15.800]  when you fight evil, you get rewarded.
[20:15.800 --> 20:19.800]  And I'm just seeing this victory, seeing this happen.
[20:19.800 --> 20:21.800]  Right now, I am, I'm just going to pause
[20:21.800 --> 20:23.800]  and enjoy this for a minute. Excuse me, hold on.
[20:23.800 --> 20:25.800]  Oh.
[20:25.800 --> 20:27.800]  Oh.
[20:27.800 --> 20:29.800]  Oh.
[20:29.800 --> 20:31.800]  Oh.
[20:31.800 --> 20:33.800]  Oh, I'm serious.
[20:33.800 --> 20:35.800]  Oh, just enjoyment.
[20:35.800 --> 20:37.800]  This is better than any drug I've ever heard of out here.
[20:37.800 --> 20:39.800]  Oh.
[20:39.800 --> 20:45.800]  Oh.
[20:45.800 --> 20:48.800]  Oh, we're going to take you all to prison.
[20:48.800 --> 20:50.800]  We're going to try you.
[20:50.800 --> 20:53.800]  And a whole bunch of you are going to get strung up.
[20:53.800 --> 20:57.800]  Oh.
[20:57.800 --> 21:00.800]  I'm sorry. I'm just not going to, I enjoy this.
[21:00.800 --> 21:02.800]  I have to enjoy it.
[21:02.800 --> 21:04.800]  I deserve a little bit of victory,
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.800]  occasionally a little bit of a victory dance.
[21:06.800 --> 21:09.800]  I'm going to be having one tonight now
[21:09.800 --> 21:12.800]  because every person that steps forward,
[21:12.800 --> 21:14.800]  every big shot that goes public,
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.800]  and it's happening every few weeks now,
[21:16.800 --> 21:18.800]  is one inch closer.
[21:18.800 --> 21:20.800]  And we're only a foot or two away now
[21:20.800 --> 21:22.800]  from slitting the New World Order's throat
[21:22.800 --> 21:24.800]  and surviving and living
[21:24.800 --> 21:26.800]  and being able to not work as hard,
[21:26.800 --> 21:28.800]  you know, not fight the New World Order as hard,
[21:28.800 --> 21:30.800]  not be able to have a life
[21:30.800 --> 21:34.800]  and not worried about getting drug off to some FEMA camp.
[21:34.800 --> 21:36.800]  But anyways, you know, he's a very quiet,
[21:36.800 --> 21:39.800]  pensive person, very reserved.
[21:39.800 --> 21:41.800]  But if you hear what he has to say,
[21:41.800 --> 21:42.800]  you know, he's saying,
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.800]  look, it is what it is,
[21:44.800 --> 21:46.800]  and a lot of people think it is.
[21:46.800 --> 21:48.800]  So he went about 95% of the way,
[21:48.800 --> 21:49.800]  and it's an exciting clip.
[21:49.800 --> 21:52.800]  And I've never, I think I've ever done a five-minute segment
[21:52.800 --> 21:55.800]  where I'm just giddily basically supine,
[21:55.800 --> 21:58.800]  basically on my back, figuratively,
[21:58.800 --> 22:03.800]  in a something akin to rapture.
[22:03.800 --> 22:08.800]  But I do enjoy seeing
[22:08.800 --> 22:10.800]  their House of Cards fall.
[22:10.800 --> 22:12.800]  It's like I'm watching a dam,
[22:12.800 --> 22:14.800]  and bigger and bigger chunks are busting out
[22:14.800 --> 22:17.800]  larger gouts of water
[22:17.800 --> 22:20.800]  as it is spraying through the orifice
[22:20.800 --> 22:22.800]  as it gets larger.
[22:22.800 --> 22:24.800]  And frankly, I'm just up there
[22:24.800 --> 22:27.800]  with my little ball peen hammers smacking away,
[22:27.800 --> 22:29.800]  and the more water sprays in my face,
[22:29.800 --> 22:31.800]  the happier I get.
[22:31.800 --> 22:33.800]  So you get all giddy and dance around
[22:33.800 --> 22:34.800]  when your football team scores,
[22:34.800 --> 22:36.800]  which means nothing to your children's future,
[22:36.800 --> 22:38.800]  nothing to this country, and you're normal.
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.800]  I'm bad when I have a tribal victory dance on air
[22:43.800 --> 22:47.800]  for another great salvo,
[22:47.800 --> 22:50.800]  another capital ship of the New World Order,
[22:50.800 --> 22:54.800]  listing and capsizing and sinking.
[22:54.800 --> 22:55.800]  We're on the march.
[22:55.800 --> 22:58.800]  The Empire's on the run.
[22:58.800 --> 23:05.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[23:05.800 --> 23:07.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[23:07.800 --> 23:11.800]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show,
[23:11.800 --> 23:14.800]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[23:14.800 --> 23:17.800]  You see, normally, it only happens every few weeks or so.
[23:17.800 --> 23:19.800]  I get one of those euphoric rushes of victory,
[23:19.800 --> 23:21.800]  but it's usually when I'm off air.
[23:21.800 --> 23:24.800]  When I dance around, there's lots of back slapping.
[23:24.800 --> 23:26.800]  But I just got word, heard part of the clip
[23:26.800 --> 23:30.800]  during the last break came in with the news
[23:30.800 --> 23:33.800]  and just had to share it with you.
[23:33.800 --> 23:34.800]  This is life and death.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.800]  See, imagine how excited people get
[23:36.800 --> 23:38.800]  about a basketball or football game
[23:38.800 --> 23:41.800]  when there's a grand slam or a sudden death over time,
[23:41.800 --> 23:44.800]  you know, last second on the clock running it in.
[23:44.800 --> 23:47.800]  Imagine that euphoria that people have.
[23:47.800 --> 23:49.800]  You see, that's misplaced euphoria.
[23:49.800 --> 23:54.800]  That's because that tribal symbolic mock battle you're seeing,
[23:54.800 --> 23:56.800]  it has those feelings of euphoria for you,
[23:56.800 --> 23:58.800]  because it's a counterfeit of what you're really
[23:58.800 --> 24:00.800]  supposed to get excited about,
[24:00.800 --> 24:02.800]  and that's real warfare for your family,
[24:02.800 --> 24:05.800]  your tribe, your country.
[24:05.800 --> 24:08.800]  That's what we're talking about here.
[24:08.800 --> 24:11.800]  And the New World Order is taking our families from us,
[24:11.800 --> 24:12.800]  breaking down the family,
[24:12.800 --> 24:14.800]  they're taking our countries from us,
[24:14.800 --> 24:16.800]  they're taking our states from us,
[24:16.800 --> 24:18.800]  and then all we serve is the state,
[24:18.800 --> 24:20.800]  the all-powerful global state,
[24:20.800 --> 24:23.800]  and the state then knows that we want to make war,
[24:23.800 --> 24:24.800]  that's how we're designed,
[24:24.800 --> 24:27.800]  and so they make us make war with weak third-world countries,
[24:27.800 --> 24:29.800]  which is really a war against the people that they're attacking,
[24:29.800 --> 24:32.800]  and the slaves themselves, that's us,
[24:32.800 --> 24:35.800]  and then they wage war against us domestically
[24:35.800 --> 24:39.800]  by divide and conquer, playing us all off against each other.
[24:39.800 --> 24:43.800]  This is how they operate, this is their program.
[24:43.800 --> 24:45.800]  All right, here's David Lynch of the Elephant Man,
[24:45.800 --> 24:48.800]  Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway,
[24:48.800 --> 24:50.800]  Blue Velvet, Eraserhead.
[24:50.800 --> 24:55.800]  I mean, we're talking hundreds of credits,
[24:55.800 --> 24:58.800]  well, over 50 major films, TV.
[24:58.800 --> 25:02.800]  I mean, I can't go over all of it here.
[25:02.800 --> 25:04.800]  And here he is talking about 9-11 and saying,
[25:04.800 --> 25:06.800]  yeah, well, a lot of people think it is,
[25:06.800 --> 25:08.800]  you know, the buildings fell like that.
[25:08.800 --> 25:10.800]  They said they pulled it.
[25:10.800 --> 25:14.800]  I mean, this is really strong word for somebody I've seen interviewed
[25:14.800 --> 25:18.800]  who is very introspective, you could say.
[25:18.800 --> 25:20.800]  Here it is.
[25:20.800 --> 25:21.800]  What do you think?
[25:21.800 --> 25:23.800]  Do you think it's convincing,
[25:23.800 --> 25:26.800]  what I tell in the film?
[25:26.800 --> 25:31.800]  It's not so much what they say.
[25:31.800 --> 25:35.800]  It's the things that, you know,
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.800]  make you look at what you thought you saw in a different light.
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.800]  And those things for me that bother me
[25:45.800 --> 25:49.800]  is the hole in the Pentagon being too small for a plane,
[25:49.800 --> 25:51.800]  the lawn isn't messed up,
[25:51.800 --> 25:54.800]  and the government's not showing the plane hitting
[25:54.800 --> 25:57.800]  when many cameras photographed it.
[25:57.800 --> 25:59.800]  At the World Trade Center,
[25:59.800 --> 26:04.800]  three buildings came down like demolition.
[26:04.800 --> 26:07.800]  And two of them were hit by a plane,
[26:07.800 --> 26:09.800]  but the third one, they said,
[26:09.800 --> 26:11.800]  do you want us to pull it?
[26:11.800 --> 26:14.800]  And they pulled it, and it looked just like the other two.
[26:14.800 --> 26:16.800]  Those things bother me.
[26:16.800 --> 26:19.800]  In Pennsylvania, the plane that went down,
[26:19.800 --> 26:21.800]  it was just a hole in the ground.
[26:21.800 --> 26:24.800]  There wasn't any wreckage, there wasn't any skid marks,
[26:24.800 --> 26:27.800]  there wasn't any tear in the earth.
[26:27.800 --> 26:32.800]  And no one's ever really found out about that.
[26:32.800 --> 26:37.800]  So every place, there's questions coming from this documentary.
[26:37.800 --> 26:43.800]  And you don't have to believe everything in the documentary
[26:43.800 --> 26:45.800]  to still have questions come up.
[26:45.800 --> 26:48.800]  And you look back and you remember what you saw
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.800]  and what you were told, and now you have questions.
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.800]  And the event itself was, did it change your life
[26:57.800 --> 26:59.800]  or did it change your view of...
[26:59.800 --> 27:05.800]  And now it's just an event that has many questions
[27:05.800 --> 27:07.800]  and no answers.
[27:07.800 --> 27:12.800]  And the suggestion that the American government is behind it,
[27:12.800 --> 27:16.800]  it's too big for people to think about.
[27:16.800 --> 27:19.800]  It's too big.
[27:19.800 --> 27:21.800]  What do you mean?
[27:21.800 --> 27:28.800]  It's just, you know, it's like something no one must think about.
[27:28.800 --> 27:29.800]  Unbelievable.
[27:29.800 --> 27:31.800]  So that's what Charlie Sheen said.
[27:31.800 --> 27:33.800]  Look, it just doesn't fit.
[27:33.800 --> 27:35.800]  There's too many questions.
[27:35.800 --> 27:36.800]  The story's a lie.
[27:36.800 --> 27:39.800]  So who stands to gain?
[27:39.800 --> 27:42.800]  That is just amazing.
[27:42.800 --> 27:44.800]  And this just hit us out of the blue.
[27:44.800 --> 27:45.800]  We just learned of this.
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.800]  We'll be posting the video up on infowars.com
[27:49.800 --> 27:52.800]  and prismplanet.com and jonesreport.com.
[27:52.800 --> 27:53.800]  Aaron's doing it right now.
[27:53.800 --> 27:57.800]  So the first place you'll see it will be at jonesreport.com.
[27:57.800 --> 28:00.800]  I don't make Aaron work 18 hours a day,
[28:00.800 --> 28:02.800]  but he likes to four or five days a week.
[28:02.800 --> 28:06.800]  So that's why so many times, if you want to see the latest breaking news,
[28:06.800 --> 28:09.800]  jonesreport.com.
[28:09.800 --> 28:13.800]  I mean, that's where you'll see a lot of things I'm here at the office working on
[28:13.800 --> 28:15.800]  first because he's always there.
[28:15.800 --> 28:19.800]  Lord Slickheisen, it's a joke around here.
[28:19.800 --> 28:20.800]  I shouldn't joke around.
[28:20.800 --> 28:21.800]  We all tease each other because, you know,
[28:21.800 --> 28:23.800]  they call each other British lords and all that over in England.
[28:23.800 --> 28:26.800]  The New World Order does, so we joke around and do that.
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.800]  Ryan Slickheisen works on info wars off and on,
[28:31.800 --> 28:33.800]  I'd say about 10, 12 hours a day.
[28:33.800 --> 28:34.800]  Sometimes he updates late at night.
[28:34.800 --> 28:36.800]  Sometimes in the morning he updates multiple times daily.
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.800]  The Watson's update, like a newspaper,
[28:42.800 --> 28:45.800]  at about nine o'clock central in the morning,
[28:45.800 --> 28:49.800]  and it's six o'clock, the 6.30 central at night.
[28:49.800 --> 28:53.800]  And of course, breaking news as it develops.
[28:53.800 --> 28:56.800]  infowars.net is updated once a day,
[28:56.800 --> 29:00.800]  but it always has original reportage by Steve Watson
[29:00.800 --> 29:04.800]  and then other little signature of news that he thinks is important.
[29:04.800 --> 29:06.800]  So that's why we have so many sites.
[29:06.800 --> 29:08.800]  The real reason we developed so many sites is because we had
[29:08.800 --> 29:11.800]  so many denial of service attacks, hack attacks,
[29:11.800 --> 29:13.800]  where I mean they'd go in and bring the site down
[29:13.800 --> 29:16.800]  and post, you know, a naked woman on a motorcycle,
[29:16.800 --> 29:17.800]  stuff like that.
[29:17.800 --> 29:19.800]  And we had to trigger it where if somebody went in
[29:19.800 --> 29:21.800]  and did that, it would just bring the site down.
[29:21.800 --> 29:25.800]  So if it was hacked, we had a failsafe to just bring the site down.
[29:25.800 --> 29:26.800]  So I said, you know what?
[29:26.800 --> 29:29.800]  Every time I'm attacked, I just launch more websites.
[29:29.800 --> 29:32.800]  You know, it's a superhero analogy, you know,
[29:32.800 --> 29:34.800]  I guess Marvel and the others, you know,
[29:34.800 --> 29:36.800]  all have their characters where you hit it,
[29:36.800 --> 29:38.800]  you attack it, it just gets stronger.
[29:38.800 --> 29:41.800]  We work harder when we're attacked.
[29:41.800 --> 29:44.800]  I think a lot of times with stalkers and disinfo agents
[29:44.800 --> 29:46.800]  attack us, I go, that's it.
[29:46.800 --> 29:48.800]  I'm just going to work till three in the morning.
[29:48.800 --> 29:51.800]  In fact, you give us our strength.
[29:51.800 --> 29:53.800]  And I know you can't stop at your nature.
[29:53.800 --> 29:55.800]  You just keep giving us the strength
[29:55.800 --> 29:58.800]  because your curses, we turn into blessings, God does.
[29:58.800 --> 30:03.800]  And you need to know that because it just enrages you
[30:03.800 --> 30:06.800]  to do any fun more.
[30:11.800 --> 30:15.800]  Sorry, some aftershocks from the celebration earlier.
[30:15.800 --> 30:18.800]  Yeah, thank you, God. Thank you, Jesus.
[30:18.800 --> 30:21.800]  I love it. I love what's happening.
[30:21.800 --> 30:23.800]  We just believe in victory, have the information,
[30:23.800 --> 30:25.800]  move forward without fear.
[30:25.800 --> 30:27.800]  We're concerned for our own lives.
[30:27.800 --> 30:30.800]  We will have victory.
[30:33.800 --> 30:35.800]  I'm not doing this to lose.
[30:35.800 --> 30:38.800]  I'm not doing this because I don't think
[30:38.800 --> 30:39.800]  the enemy can't be beaten.
[30:39.800 --> 30:42.800]  I'm doing this because I know we can win.
[30:45.800 --> 30:47.800]  Woo, yeah.
[30:47.800 --> 30:49.800]  I need to compose myself a bit
[30:49.800 --> 30:51.800]  and then later get more into this.
[30:51.800 --> 30:54.800]  I got Nick Beggage coming up, Dr. Beggage and Butch Paw.
[30:54.800 --> 30:55.800]  Butch will want to talk about this.
[30:55.800 --> 30:56.800]  We'll talk about it with Beggage.
[30:56.800 --> 30:57.800]  We'll open the phones up for you.
[30:57.800 --> 31:00.800]  Do you want to talk about this?
[31:00.800 --> 31:01.800]  And see, it's a chain reaction.
[31:01.800 --> 31:03.800]  It's hardest for the first person to do it.
[31:03.800 --> 31:05.800]  The Trailblazer.
[31:05.800 --> 31:06.800]  Lewis and Clark.
[31:06.800 --> 31:08.800]  They don't remember the guys that came right after them,
[31:08.800 --> 31:10.800]  which was just as hard.
[31:10.800 --> 31:12.800]  The Trailblazer.
[31:12.800 --> 31:16.800]  The guy that hit the barbed wire.
[31:16.800 --> 31:20.800]  Charlie Sheen.
[31:20.800 --> 31:24.800]  No, it wasn't Mel Gibson.
[31:24.800 --> 31:27.800]  It wasn't Rick Linklater.
[31:27.800 --> 31:29.800]  It wasn't the Dixie Chicks,
[31:29.800 --> 31:30.800]  who, listen, right here in Austin,
[31:30.800 --> 31:32.800]  and are great people and we know their folks,
[31:32.800 --> 31:34.800]  who know all about it and have seen
[31:34.800 --> 31:35.800]  Rotority four years ago,
[31:35.800 --> 31:37.800]  who will not go public on it.
[31:37.800 --> 31:40.800]  That's fine.
[31:40.800 --> 31:44.800]  It isn't Keanu Reeves.
[31:44.800 --> 31:52.800]  It isn't Mr. Downey.
[31:52.800 --> 31:56.800]  Or Woody Harrelson.
[31:56.800 --> 32:01.800]  Or folks like...
[32:01.800 --> 32:02.800]  I won't even say their names.
[32:02.800 --> 32:04.800]  I shouldn't.
[32:04.800 --> 32:08.800]  No, they didn't go public
[32:08.800 --> 32:10.800]  when they knew about it,
[32:10.800 --> 32:14.800]  for whatever reasons.
[32:14.800 --> 32:16.800]  They didn't.
[32:16.800 --> 32:17.800]  And that's okay.
[32:17.800 --> 32:21.800]  Nobody said they had to.
[32:21.800 --> 32:25.800]  Charlie Sheen did.
[32:25.800 --> 32:31.800]  And that's why I admire him so much.
[32:31.800 --> 32:34.800]  That's why I admire Charlie Sheen.
[32:34.800 --> 32:36.800]  Because he has got so much courage,
[32:36.800 --> 32:38.800]  and he knew what would happen.
[32:38.800 --> 32:42.800]  And boy, you saw what happened to him
[32:42.800 --> 32:44.800]  after he didn't shut up.
[32:44.800 --> 32:45.800]  A few weeks after he went public,
[32:45.800 --> 32:46.800]  they told him,
[32:46.800 --> 32:48.800]  you shut your mouth
[32:48.800 --> 32:49.800]  through the grapevine other ways.
[32:49.800 --> 32:51.800]  I shouldn't even get into it.
[32:51.800 --> 32:52.800]  It's hard to hold your tongue.
[32:52.800 --> 32:55.800]  You know, just how much a hero somebody is.
[32:55.800 --> 32:57.800]  When somebody's told point blank,
[32:57.800 --> 32:58.800]  and then he went on Jimmy Kimmel,
[32:58.800 --> 32:59.800]  and I told him,
[32:59.800 --> 33:00.800]  I said, don't do it, Charlie.
[33:00.800 --> 33:02.800]  You don't need to say anything.
[33:02.800 --> 33:03.800]  They threatened him.
[33:03.800 --> 33:04.800]  He said, you know what?
[33:04.800 --> 33:05.800]  And he went on there,
[33:05.800 --> 33:06.800]  and they brought it up,
[33:06.800 --> 33:07.800]  and he talked about it.
[33:07.800 --> 33:08.800]  The Pentagon.
[33:08.800 --> 33:11.800]  And World Trade Center seven.
[33:11.800 --> 33:13.800]  And the next day,
[33:13.800 --> 33:16.800]  they attacked him with the most vicious lies
[33:16.800 --> 33:24.800]  you can imagine.
[33:24.800 --> 33:26.800]  But I tell you,
[33:26.800 --> 33:28.800]  getting the silver medal still good.
[33:28.800 --> 33:33.800]  David Lynch.
[33:33.800 --> 33:38.800]  It's wonderful.
[33:38.800 --> 33:40.800]  The house of cards is falling.
[33:40.800 --> 33:43.800]  I mean, listen, you heard
[33:43.800 --> 33:47.800]  Steel, the founder of Marine Corps Intelligence on high-level
[33:47.800 --> 33:50.800]  C.I.A. Glandestine in the field.
[33:50.800 --> 33:52.800]  You know, Dachville James Bond type.
[33:52.800 --> 33:54.800]  Highly respected.
[33:54.800 --> 33:56.800]  Tell you clearly they could indict Dick Cheney for doing it.
[33:56.800 --> 33:58.800]  You've heard German defense ministers.
[33:58.800 --> 34:00.800]  You've heard members of parliament.
[34:00.800 --> 34:02.800]  You've heard members of Blair's cabinet.
[34:02.800 --> 34:05.800]  You've heard members of the last Bush administration,
[34:05.800 --> 34:07.800]  George W's first term.
[34:07.800 --> 34:10.800]  You've heard all these scientists and experts,
[34:10.800 --> 34:12.800]  but people don't listen to them like they listen.
[34:12.800 --> 34:15.800]  Like they listen to somebody from Hollywood.
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.800]  But it resonated that much stronger
[34:19.800 --> 34:22.800]  because people knew the courage it took
[34:22.800 --> 34:29.800]  for Charles Sheen to do what he did.
[34:29.800 --> 34:31.800]  Unbelievable.
[34:31.800 --> 34:33.800]  Just, oh.
[34:33.800 --> 34:35.800]  I mean, that type of example.
[34:35.800 --> 34:37.800]  Just exemplary.
[34:37.800 --> 34:39.800]  Everything that's good about man.
[34:39.800 --> 34:41.800]  Everything that's good about our history.
[34:41.800 --> 34:45.800]  The finer things, the finer attributes that God's given us.
[34:45.800 --> 34:52.800]  Just absolutely fabulous.
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.800]  And you're here to hear news and information.
[34:56.800 --> 34:59.800]  I'm just, normally I learn these type of things,
[34:59.800 --> 35:02.800]  you know, when I'm off air and would be busy
[35:02.800 --> 35:05.800]  working on getting a text report out,
[35:05.800 --> 35:07.800]  working on getting a story out,
[35:07.800 --> 35:10.800]  and would kind of consume myself with those,
[35:10.800 --> 35:12.800]  you know, consume my energy and the action,
[35:12.800 --> 35:16.800]  but just being here on air,
[35:16.800 --> 35:18.800]  I'm almost speechless here.
[35:18.800 --> 35:20.800]  This is just so good.
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.800]  You realize that the dam is breaking.
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.800]  The dam is breaking.
[35:27.800 --> 35:31.800]  In every way, on every subject.
[35:31.800 --> 35:39.800]  And it's getting faster and faster in its implosion.
[35:39.800 --> 35:41.800]  Meanwhile, we have a disgusting example
[35:41.800 --> 35:45.800]  of traitorous, lecherous, scrupulous filth
[35:45.800 --> 35:47.800]  with the Democrats saying,
[35:47.800 --> 35:50.800]  we're going to increase the troops.
[35:50.800 --> 35:53.800]  We're going to stay there many more years.
[35:53.800 --> 35:56.800]  We can't let the Iraqis down
[35:56.800 --> 35:59.800]  when Ray McGovern, high-level CIA analyst,
[35:59.800 --> 36:02.800]  gave the presidential brief to Reagan and Bush Sr.
[36:02.800 --> 36:04.800]  that told you that clearly our government
[36:04.800 --> 36:06.800]  and other Western governments
[36:06.800 --> 36:08.800]  are staging terror attacks in Iraq.
[36:08.800 --> 36:10.800]  They will stage the trigger events
[36:10.800 --> 36:17.800]  to kick off escalating conflict
[36:17.800 --> 36:19.800]  between the Sunnis, the Shiite, the Kurds,
[36:19.800 --> 36:25.800]  and even the subgroups of those three main groups.
[36:25.800 --> 36:27.800]  The plan was to break it in three parts.
[36:27.800 --> 36:29.800]  The plan was to balkanize it.
[36:29.800 --> 36:31.800]  The plan was to take a first-world nation
[36:31.800 --> 36:35.800]  with 60% of their college graduates being women,
[36:35.800 --> 36:38.800]  60 plus percent, I think the number was 64%,
[36:38.800 --> 36:41.800]  of their new doctors being women.
[36:41.800 --> 36:45.800]  That's higher than the US.
[36:45.800 --> 36:47.800]  I mean, if you judge it by Western standards,
[36:47.800 --> 36:49.800]  shopping malls, rock and roll music,
[36:49.800 --> 36:54.800]  playboy on the shelves,
[36:54.800 --> 36:57.800]  becoming a big tourist destination
[36:57.800 --> 37:02.800]  for Europeans and Americans to go see the Babylonian ruins,
[37:02.800 --> 37:05.800]  because Saddam was a CIA boy put in
[37:05.800 --> 37:07.800]  back when there was another policy
[37:07.800 --> 37:09.800]  to just take over nations and set them up and develop them.
[37:09.800 --> 37:11.800]  Well, that policy changed,
[37:11.800 --> 37:13.800]  and the new policy was to set him up,
[37:13.800 --> 37:15.800]  tell him to go ahead and go into Kuwait,
[37:15.800 --> 37:17.800]  like we told him to go into Iran,
[37:17.800 --> 37:19.800]  and then pull the rug out from under him.
[37:19.800 --> 37:20.800]  And he was a murderer,
[37:20.800 --> 37:22.800]  but compared to the other people in that region,
[37:22.800 --> 37:27.800]  the guy was a choir boy.
[37:27.800 --> 37:30.800]  And now you don't have any Jews living in peace in Iraq.
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.800]  Now the Christians are getting kicked out,
[37:32.800 --> 37:39.800]  the Christians that have been there for 2,000 years.
[37:39.800 --> 37:43.800]  There have been Christians for over 1,900 years in Iraq.
[37:43.800 --> 37:49.800]  There are 1,800-year-old chapels
[37:49.800 --> 37:54.800]  in the mountains in the north.
[37:54.800 --> 37:57.800]  There are no Christians there now,
[37:57.800 --> 38:01.800]  because the globalists back the Islamists.
[38:01.800 --> 38:03.800]  They took them after World War II.
[38:03.800 --> 38:04.800]  Hitler had used them.
[38:04.800 --> 38:06.800]  Our government funded them.
[38:06.800 --> 38:07.800]  The British funded them.
[38:07.800 --> 38:09.800]  The Israelis, when they got in, funded them
[38:09.800 --> 38:11.800]  to radicalize and bring down leaders,
[38:11.800 --> 38:13.800]  whether they were good, bad, or indifferent.
[38:13.800 --> 38:15.800]  They weren't controlled by the globalists.
[38:15.800 --> 38:16.800]  They were brought down,
[38:16.800 --> 38:20.800]  and now they use this threat that they have forged,
[38:20.800 --> 38:23.800]  that they took a little seed and grew it into a mighty oak,
[38:23.800 --> 38:27.800]  and now they threaten the West with it
[38:27.800 --> 38:29.800]  while bringing in record numbers of Muslims
[38:29.800 --> 38:32.800]  into Europe and the U.S. and Canada,
[38:32.800 --> 38:34.800]  until you give up all your rights
[38:34.800 --> 38:37.800]  and let the police order you around
[38:37.800 --> 38:38.800]  and let them database you
[38:38.800 --> 38:39.800]  and let them search you and track you
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.800]  while the border stays wide open,
[38:42.800 --> 38:50.800]  or these limo fascists will get us.
[38:50.800 --> 38:52.800]  It's disgusting.
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.800]  It's so obvious,
[38:54.800 --> 38:56.800]  but forget the obviousness of it.
[38:56.800 --> 38:57.800]  It's admitted.
[38:57.800 --> 38:58.800]  It's documented.
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.800]  Operation Cyclone and all the other declassified programs
[39:02.800 --> 39:08.800]  to do just what you now see happening.
[39:08.800 --> 39:10.800]  The new older crime syndicate that runs our country
[39:10.800 --> 39:12.800]  is getting rid of our borders.
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.800]  We're in the North American Union now.
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.800]  They have the bureaucracies merging.
[39:18.800 --> 39:21.800]  The very people destroying our country's sovereignty
[39:21.800 --> 39:24.800]  are the ones that are bringing in the foreigners at record clips
[39:24.800 --> 39:26.800]  and then funding the organizations
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.800]  for the last 50 years plus,
[39:31.800 --> 39:36.800]  maybe 52 years as you can track definite funding,
[39:36.800 --> 39:38.800]  and then meanwhile radicalizing these people
[39:38.800 --> 39:40.800]  when many of them don't even understand
[39:40.800 --> 39:42.800]  who they're controlled by
[39:42.800 --> 39:44.800]  and they can't even see the strings
[39:44.800 --> 39:49.800]  that lead back to the New World order.
[39:49.800 --> 39:51.800]  So that's the score.
[39:51.800 --> 39:52.800]  That's what we're dealing with.
[39:52.800 --> 39:55.800]  That's what we're looking at right now.
[39:55.800 --> 39:56.800]  Here's another one.
[39:56.800 --> 39:57.800]  Jerusalem Post.
[39:57.800 --> 40:00.800]  Israel and Iran holding secret talks.
[40:00.800 --> 40:02.800]  Iran continues to deny that Israel has the right to exist.
[40:02.800 --> 40:05.800]  Iran and Israeli representatives are holding clandestine talks
[40:05.800 --> 40:07.800]  in Europe to settle the old Israeli debt.
[40:07.800 --> 40:09.800]  Iraq's reported Wednesday.
[40:09.800 --> 40:13.800]  Iran is still owned hundreds of millions of dollars for oil.
[40:13.800 --> 40:16.800]  It's supplied to Israel in the years before the Islamic Revolution in 79.
[40:16.800 --> 40:18.800]  Representatives of the two countries
[40:18.800 --> 40:21.800]  now sworn enemies are holding contacts
[40:21.800 --> 40:26.800]  between to settle the debt according to reported harass.
[40:26.800 --> 40:29.800]  Isn't that interesting?
[40:29.800 --> 40:32.800]  They're in a mediation process.
[40:32.800 --> 40:34.800]  Here's an interesting tidbit on 9-11.
[40:34.800 --> 40:35.800]  A sad one.
[40:35.800 --> 40:40.800]  New York Daily News blaze kills daughter of 9-11 pilot.
[40:40.800 --> 40:42.800]  The 9-11 pilot, my friends,
[40:42.800 --> 40:44.800]  we'll tell you about that when we get back.
[40:44.800 --> 40:46.800]  Tragedy struck a 9-11 family
[40:46.800 --> 40:50.800]  for the second time when the daughter of one of the hijacked pilots
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.800]  was killed in a suspicious, suspicious blaze.
[40:55.800 --> 40:59.800]  New Jersey yesterday.
[40:59.800 --> 41:02.800]  Wendy Merlin game.
[41:02.800 --> 41:04.800]  A clear hit of there ever was one.
[41:04.800 --> 41:06.800]  We'll tell you about it when we get back.
[41:06.800 --> 41:16.800]  Stay with us.
[41:36.800 --> 41:47.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to stand out in the light
[41:47.800 --> 41:49.800]  because it's an inside job.
[41:49.800 --> 41:55.800]  Keep rolling.
[41:55.800 --> 42:13.800]  It came and took it all away.
[42:13.800 --> 42:28.800]  And it's an inside job.
[42:28.800 --> 42:53.800]  It came and took it all away.
[42:53.800 --> 43:08.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[43:13.800 --> 43:26.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[43:26.800 --> 43:34.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[43:34.800 --> 43:42.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[43:42.800 --> 43:52.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[43:52.800 --> 44:02.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[44:02.800 --> 44:11.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[44:11.800 --> 44:21.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[44:21.800 --> 44:31.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[44:31.800 --> 44:41.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[44:41.800 --> 44:51.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[44:51.800 --> 45:01.800]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light,
[45:01.800 --> 45:11.800]  but if you don't, you're going to be enslaved.
[45:11.800 --> 45:21.800]  You're going to be enslaved.
[45:41.800 --> 45:51.800]  We're going in through and beyond.
[45:51.800 --> 45:55.800]  We're engaging the New World Order.
[45:55.800 --> 46:03.800]  We are having victory after victory after victory.
[46:03.800 --> 46:13.800]  Horrible news, though.
[46:13.800 --> 46:15.800]  It's a basic analysis.
[46:15.800 --> 46:19.800]  Blaze kills a daughter of a 9-11 pilot,
[46:19.800 --> 46:22.800]  and they go on to say it is suspicious.
[46:22.800 --> 46:24.800]  The tragedy stuck in the 9-11 family.
[46:24.800 --> 46:29.800]  It's the second time the daughter of one of the hijacked pilots was killed.
[46:29.800 --> 46:34.800]  And it's, of course, the pilot was Mr. Burlingame,
[46:34.800 --> 46:38.800]  Chick Burlingame, who was playing Crash of the Pentagon on September 11th.
[46:38.800 --> 46:43.800]  It's just an example of extreme tragedy, said Tim Sumner,
[46:43.800 --> 46:46.800]  who knew Wendy Burlingame from the 9-11 family survivor group.
[46:46.800 --> 46:50.800]  Oh, of course, the head of that group, Mr. Doyle,
[46:50.800 --> 46:52.800]  says the majority of them believe it's a total inside job.
[46:52.800 --> 46:54.800]  You can't fire about them all, can you?
[46:54.800 --> 46:57.800]  It's just an extreme tragedy, said Tim Sumner,
[46:57.800 --> 47:00.800]  who knew Wendy Burlingame from the 9-11 family survivor group.
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.800]  It's an amazing blow to that family.
[47:02.800 --> 47:04.800]  Wendy Burlingame's aunt, Deborah Burlingame,
[47:04.800 --> 47:06.800]  a member of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation Board,
[47:06.800 --> 47:09.800]  was too heartbroken to speak last night.
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.800]  The fire broke out at about 12.30 a.m. in the Galaxy Towers apartment building,
[47:14.800 --> 47:17.800]  shared with her fiance, Kevin Roderick.
[47:17.800 --> 47:19.800]  I wonder when she met Kevin.
[47:19.800 --> 47:22.800]  Met the handsome young man, taking good care of her,
[47:22.800 --> 47:24.800]  I would imagine, the last year or so.
[47:24.800 --> 47:27.800]  Neighbors said Burlingame moved in the apartment,
[47:27.800 --> 47:29.800]  overlooking the Hudson River about a month ago.
[47:29.800 --> 47:31.800]  Roderick escaped the fire.
[47:31.800 --> 47:34.800]  They say suspicious.
[47:34.800 --> 47:37.800]  The paper does not mean the police are saying suspicious.
[47:37.800 --> 47:40.800]  But they'll quiet down quickly, I would imagine.
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.800]  Firefighters battled the stubborn blaze for about three hours
[47:44.800 --> 47:46.800]  before bringing it under control.
[47:46.800 --> 47:49.800]  Firefighters found Burlingame's body in a hallway
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.800]  between the kitchen and the bathroom.
[47:51.800 --> 47:54.800]  The investigators said it is suspicious at this point
[47:54.800 --> 47:57.800]  because the cause of the origin had not been established.
[47:57.800 --> 48:01.800]  Hudson County Prosecutor Edward Defazio said Defazio said
[48:01.800 --> 48:03.800]  the fire damaged neighboring apartments.
[48:03.800 --> 48:05.800]  A neighbor reported hearing a commotion coming
[48:05.800 --> 48:09.800]  from Burlingame's apartment just before the fire alarms
[48:09.800 --> 48:13.800]  in the building sounded.
[48:13.800 --> 48:17.800]  Her father took part in CIA drills.
[48:17.800 --> 48:21.800]  This is mainstream news.
[48:21.800 --> 48:23.800]  There were multiple drills in the year before 9-11,
[48:23.800 --> 48:24.800]  of course drills that morning.
[48:24.800 --> 48:27.800]  He took part in drills.
[48:27.800 --> 48:30.800]  We've always said this is a key player,
[48:30.800 --> 48:33.800]  one of the few key points.
[48:33.800 --> 48:36.800]  We have attempted to contact family members and they won't talk.
[48:36.800 --> 48:38.800]  You get them on the phone, they'll say no, no.
[48:38.800 --> 48:39.800]  They'll say it's dangerous.
[48:39.800 --> 48:40.800]  I can't talk. Firefighters.
[48:40.800 --> 48:42.800]  No, my wife doesn't want me to.
[48:42.800 --> 48:43.800]  And I've had women screaming at me.
[48:43.800 --> 48:44.800]  It's happened multiple times.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.800]  Get off the phone and they told you.
[48:46.800 --> 48:47.800]  You want to get on the phone.
[48:47.800 --> 48:52.800]  I remember that when I talked to Cacioli.
[48:52.800 --> 48:55.800]  I remember when we got on the phone with the head
[48:55.800 --> 48:57.800]  of the defense language school briefly,
[48:57.800 --> 49:00.800]  right after he was in the AP talking about how they were forced
[49:00.800 --> 49:08.800]  to train some of the hijackers in high level spy signals training.
[49:08.800 --> 49:11.800]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[49:11.800 --> 49:15.800]  I wonder how many people will be fire bombed.
[49:15.800 --> 49:17.800]  I wonder how many people will die.
[49:17.800 --> 49:20.800]  This is, I would say, because of who she is
[49:20.800 --> 49:23.800]  and her father being one of the keys.
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.800]  I'd have to say with this 90% chance.
[49:28.800 --> 49:34.800]  I'm even more sure, but let's just say 90% that she was murdered.
[49:34.800 --> 49:39.800]  And I would be talking to her boyfriend right now
[49:39.800 --> 49:40.800]  just to see what he saw.
[49:40.800 --> 49:42.800]  I'm sure he's a nice person.
[49:42.800 --> 49:44.800]  He probably is a nice person.
[49:44.800 --> 49:45.800]  Probably not a problem.
[49:45.800 --> 49:48.800]  Might have been a gas main or something.
[49:48.800 --> 49:50.800]  Who knows what it was.
[49:50.800 --> 49:54.800]  I mean, maybe someone planted a fire bomb in the building.
[49:54.800 --> 49:55.800]  He knew nothing about it.
[49:55.800 --> 49:58.800]  It could probably be not connected.
[49:58.800 --> 50:03.800]  Just the police are saying it's suspicious.
[50:03.800 --> 50:05.800]  People should talk to him.
[50:05.800 --> 50:29.800]  We'll be right back on our shows.
[50:29.800 --> 50:34.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[50:34.800 --> 50:35.800]  You want answers?
[50:35.800 --> 50:37.800]  Well, so does he.
[50:37.800 --> 50:41.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[50:41.800 --> 50:50.800]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[50:50.800 --> 51:01.800]  The top tier director of scores of films and TV programs
[51:01.800 --> 51:04.800]  has gone public questioning.
[51:04.800 --> 51:06.800]  The official 9-11 story is huge.
[51:06.800 --> 51:10.800]  The video is going up on jonesreport.com right now for you.
[51:10.800 --> 51:13.800]  David Lynch speaks out on 9-11.
[51:13.800 --> 51:15.800]  There are many questions.
[51:15.800 --> 51:16.800]  No answers.
[51:16.800 --> 51:19.800]  We'll play that again before this hour ends.
[51:19.800 --> 51:25.800]  Also, the daughter of the Flight 77 pilot, Charles Chick Berlingame,
[51:25.800 --> 51:28.800]  who had been part of government drills of flying hijacked jets
[51:28.800 --> 51:32.800]  for buildings in the year before, can't make this type of stuff up.
[51:32.800 --> 51:35.800]  I mean, that is unbelievable.
[51:35.800 --> 51:40.800]  She was consumed in flame.
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.800]  Her boyfriend got out of the apartment.
[51:42.800 --> 51:46.800]  The police and the district attorney are calling it suspicious.
[51:46.800 --> 51:49.800]  And she is now dead.
[51:49.800 --> 51:57.800]  Consumed by flame, extremely, extremely, extremely suspicious.
[51:57.800 --> 51:59.800]  We haven't had him on in about a year.
[51:59.800 --> 52:01.800]  I'm always honored to have him join us.
[52:01.800 --> 52:06.800]  And we're carrying, in time for you to get it, before Christmas.
[52:06.800 --> 52:09.800]  Remember, I didn't plug last hour, my film's Terror Storm.
[52:09.800 --> 52:12.800]  The other books and videos, like America Freedom to Fascism, we're carrying.
[52:12.800 --> 52:16.800]  Our new 9-11 Inside Job t-shirt is lowest 9.95.
[52:16.800 --> 52:19.800]  It's about getting the word out this holiday season.
[52:19.800 --> 52:22.800]  It's Christmas holiday that's coming up.
[52:22.800 --> 52:26.800]  And we guarantee that you will get materials shipped to you days before Christmas.
[52:26.800 --> 52:28.800]  We ship at UPS Ground.
[52:28.800 --> 52:34.800]  If you order by the 15th, any orders that come in by, you know, the midnight of the 15th,
[52:34.800 --> 52:37.800]  we will then ship it out overnight.
[52:37.800 --> 52:42.800]  That is, we'll work that night and then that's Saturday to make sure it all gets out.
[52:42.800 --> 52:46.800]  So you get it days before Christmas.
[52:46.800 --> 52:53.800]  Please go to infowars.com and produce a secure online, safe video and bookstore there.
[52:53.800 --> 52:58.800]  Or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[52:58.800 --> 53:02.800]  About a month ago, I got a copy of the book.
[53:02.800 --> 53:07.800]  And finally, in two nights, I had to steal time for myself to be able to read books.
[53:07.800 --> 53:12.800]  My bedside read it quickly, but still a substantive book.
[53:12.800 --> 53:16.800]  It's all in little info nodes or nodules.
[53:16.800 --> 53:19.800]  And I knew a lot of it, but learned a lot.
[53:19.800 --> 53:22.800]  Because he uses open and government source and declassified documents to prove it,
[53:22.800 --> 53:26.800]  it reads like some scary science fiction movie.
[53:26.800 --> 53:33.800]  And that's controlling the mind, the technology, political control or tools for peak performance.
[53:33.800 --> 53:37.800]  And that's a paperback book, handsome book.
[53:37.800 --> 53:41.800]  And then mind control, the brave new world for enhancing human performance, the DVD,
[53:41.800 --> 53:46.800]  which is most people watch videos, so most you'll probably be getting that as a gift.
[53:46.800 --> 53:50.800]  But if you're a reader, one of those dangerous alkytotypes,
[53:50.800 --> 53:53.800]  then you'll probably want to get the book and the DVD.
[53:53.800 --> 53:59.800]  You can get them both separately or get them together, and there's a big discount when you get them together.
[53:59.800 --> 54:02.800]  And we've got the UPS tracking number.
[54:02.800 --> 54:07.800]  They are scheduled to arrive here in my office tomorrow, and we will start shipping them out to you.
[54:07.800 --> 54:12.800]  So order them today via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart at infowars.com.
[54:12.800 --> 54:16.800]  We've gotten a parcel of these from Dr. Nick Baggage, which there's no way to go over his bio.
[54:16.800 --> 54:20.800]  His dad was a famous congressman who died under suspicious circumstances,
[54:20.800 --> 54:24.800]  who'd been trying to make sure that the people of Alaska and America got some of the oil.
[54:24.800 --> 54:29.800]  He has been elected to office. His brother is in high office in Alaska.
[54:29.800 --> 54:34.800]  He is a scientist, a doctor, has published and written a score of books
[54:34.800 --> 54:40.800]  and made a whole parcel of powerful videos as a frequent guest on national television and radio.
[54:40.800 --> 54:47.800]  And he works also with the Inuit Indigenous population, and he is also a professor.
[54:47.800 --> 54:50.800]  And we are honored to have Dr. Nick Baggage on with us.
[54:50.800 --> 54:53.800]  And I hope everybody will go get his book and video at infowars.com.
[54:53.800 --> 54:54.800]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[54:54.800 --> 54:57.800]  Well, thank you for having me, and it has been a while.
[54:57.800 --> 55:01.800]  You know, we've been busy working on this project for now a couple of years,
[55:01.800 --> 55:08.800]  and I consider it the best we've put together because it really encapsulates, I think, the most important issue.
[55:08.800 --> 55:14.800]  The domain of the human mind is certainly what everyone is trying to influence one way or the other,
[55:14.800 --> 55:20.800]  but the technology and the things that have happened over the decades makes this really, I think,
[55:20.800 --> 55:24.800]  for this century the most important story going into the century.
[55:24.800 --> 55:30.800]  It is. And before we get into it, and I'm going to try to sedate myself and lean back here
[55:30.800 --> 55:35.800]  and let you go over it, the different types of mind control, the programs, the stuff that's admitted,
[55:35.800 --> 55:43.800]  would you like to mention or comment on the breaking news of the Flight 77 pilot's daughter dying in a huge flash of fire,
[55:43.800 --> 55:47.800]  but her boyfriend escaping and the police calling it suspicious?
[55:47.800 --> 55:53.800]  And would you like to comment on the legendary director, David Lynch, speaking out on 9-11?
[55:53.800 --> 55:57.800]  Well, you know, I think a lot of this, it's really about government accountability.
[55:57.800 --> 56:01.800]  I think it's been an essential theme in a lot of our work, and I know in your work,
[56:01.800 --> 56:07.800]  the idea of hiding and being behind and then people disappearing or something happening,
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.800]  I personally experienced that with my dad during a time when things were pretty controversial.
[56:12.800 --> 56:14.800]  In fact, it reminds me of the time we're in today.
[56:14.800 --> 56:19.800]  It was back during that first, the Watergate and the Nixon administration,
[56:19.800 --> 56:22.800]  the abuses of the CIA and FBI that came out later.
[56:22.800 --> 56:30.800]  It's a repeat. We're going through the same thing, but on top of it is a 30-plus year layer of new technologies
[56:30.800 --> 56:35.800]  that make the invasiveness even more extreme.
[56:35.800 --> 56:42.800]  And when you look at the sort of the national scene, we've seen this sort of creep come in
[56:42.800 --> 56:50.800]  where we're really engaged in an environment of fear and paranoia being thrust on us by the government.
[56:50.800 --> 56:53.800]  It's not from average people. It's coming from the top down.
[56:53.800 --> 56:59.800]  Exactly. There's overt mind control with the TV, the fear, the basic opera conditioning.
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.800]  Let's run through the gamut of the different types of mind control manipulation
[57:04.800 --> 57:06.800]  that you break down in the book and the video.
[57:06.800 --> 57:10.800]  And let's go through the patented, admitted technologies that are now in place.
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.800]  Well, when you start to look at what's possible, you've got to look right into the Air Force in their own documents.
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.800]  And what they talk about in the most recent materials are what are called controlled effects.
[57:21.800 --> 57:27.800]  And they address sort of three aspects, hardware, computers, but then ultimately the human being.
[57:27.800 --> 57:31.800]  And there's a publication that the Air Force puts out.
[57:31.800 --> 57:34.800]  It's their publication, Technology Horizons.
[57:34.800 --> 57:41.800]  And there was an article in June 2004 from their electromagnetic directorate down in Maxwell Air Force Base.
[57:41.800 --> 57:44.800]  And most people don't even know such a directorate exists.
[57:44.800 --> 57:50.800]  But these are the guys that develop various forms of energy-based weapons technologies.
[57:50.800 --> 58:00.800]  And as a result, what we've seen is this sort of view that maybe, just maybe, manipulating the human being is the ultimate target.
[58:00.800 --> 58:03.800]  Here's the quote from that particular issue.
[58:03.800 --> 58:04.800]  And it's an interesting one.
[58:04.800 --> 58:08.800]  It says, by studying and modeling the human brain and nervous system,
[58:08.800 --> 58:11.800]  the ability to mentally influence a confused personnel is also possible.
[58:11.800 --> 58:17.800]  Through sensory deception, it may be possible to create synthetic images or holograms
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.800]  to confuse an individual's visual sense, or in a similar manner, confuse his senses of sound, taste, touch, or smell.
[58:24.800 --> 58:31.800]  In other words, they can create complete sensory experiences in the direction of this research.
[58:31.800 --> 58:34.800]  And what we've seen in the open literature is sort of the direction of it.
[58:34.800 --> 58:40.800]  Back in the 90s when we were engaged in our battle over the harp issue,
[58:40.800 --> 58:47.800]  one of those aspects of harp, a high-frequency, active or rural research project here in Alaska,
[58:47.800 --> 58:52.800]  was this idea that in certain ranges it could influence some human mental activity,
[58:52.800 --> 58:55.800]  either as a purposeful activity or a side effect.
[58:55.800 --> 58:59.800]  And as we began to look at that, we ran into so much material.
[58:59.800 --> 59:07.800]  I mean, there was work from Persinger at Laurentian University talking about sending energy into the magnetic field lines of the Earth
[59:07.800 --> 59:15.800]  in such a way that you could literally cover the planet and change the entire attitude of millions, billions of people.
[59:15.800 --> 59:22.800]  And that work actually at Laurentian kind of took the overview, you know, it was really affecting emotional states.
[59:22.800 --> 59:31.800]  And when you looked at Persinger's work, you can even go back to the work being done by J.F. Gordon McDonald at UCLA as a geophysicist,
[59:31.800 --> 59:36.800]  saying the same things back in 1969 in a book called, Unless Peace Comes.
[59:36.800 --> 59:42.800]  When you start to look at sort of where this all begins, it begins, you know, in terms of mind control,
[59:42.800 --> 59:50.800]  you've got to go back to the very early days of the real serious research in hypnosis, which is what we did in the book.
[59:50.800 --> 01:00:00.800]  We started in the 1880s, worked our way up into Harvard's labs in the mid-20s where we run into a character by the name of George H. Esther Brooks.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:06.800]  And this guy continues to surface from the 20s all the way to the early 60s.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:16.800]  We looked at his material, kind of looked at what he was doing, and his idea was to create sort of the ultimate by using hypnosis as the tool.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:22.800]  And what he did is take people down into a very deep hypnotic state and split their personalities deliberately.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:31.800]  He talked about this in his 1943 book called Hypnotism, which was revised in 1957.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:39.800]  And then his other book, which gets into split personality, an interesting title, 1947, it was called Spiritism by Esther Brooks.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:49.800]  By 1961, he had written the book, The Future of the Human Mind, where he actually in 61 was suggesting LSD be used for behavior modification.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:58.800]  And if people remember, that was the same time frame that the CIA was engaged in MK alters programs and doing exactly that.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:07.800]  And introduced not just a pharmacological grade LSD, but also put out the recipe.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:15.800]  Right, right. And not only did they do all this, but in conjunction with it, there was a major, major investigation of this.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:23.800]  You know, when Watergate happened, people need to remember it was CIA, excuse me, ex-CIA, if there ever is such a thing, that was supposed to break in.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:32.800]  There was a big report, and it was June 1975, it was issued, and it was a report to the President by the Commission on CIA Activities within the United States.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:42.800]  And within that, it dealt with, of course, all the standard stuff the CIA was doing to abuse us, like intercepting our mail and our phone communications and infiltrating various groups around the country.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:54.800]  Kind of sounds familiar, sounds like today, but they also talked about the use and the MK ultra program and the use of military and civilian personnel, unwitting victims.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.800]  As we began to look at that whole story, we went into tremendous amount of data.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:08.800]  And it runs the gamut. I mean, there are program plans, you know, to have helicopters fly around and spray hallucinogens on whole cities or knock out opiate gases.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  There are plans to have different antenna arrays manipulating our minds, the fluoride and the water, the mass drugging.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:24.800]  There are so many different layers to this, so I want to go from low-tech to high-tech, which the book and the film runs the gamut of, with Dr. Nick Badge, the baggage.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:45.800]  We're honored to have him stay with us.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:52.800]  Our lives mean nothing to the globalists. They revel in being ruthless.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:03:05.800]  If they'd sterilized 400 plus thousand women in America secretly and keep it secret for 40 years, plus really longer, went on from the 20s into the mid-80s when it went public, so that's 60-something years,
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:17.800]  then what will they do today? I mean, if they have the power to have antenna arrays to make us nauseous, to make us happy, to make us sleepy, to make us docile, to damage us, they will do it.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:32.800]  Again, I go off past activities, past behavior. Hitler got his ideas from scientists here and scientists in England, and John D. Rockefeller funded the big institutes of eugenics in Germany before Hitler even came to power.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:42.800]  So, understand, they have developed it. It is here. The question is, how far along is it? How will they use it against us? Dr. Nick Badge, please continue.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:49.800]  Yeah, you know, it's gone much further. Hypnosis is very crude compared to what is happening today.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  The ability to affect both in terms of private parties, being able to develop this technology, that is probably the most proliferating technology around, because it's pretty flat.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:12.800]  It's a big tech in terms of big dollars and billion-dollar laboratories. There's enough data that's been developed over the years to allow many to take a look at this technology, begin to apply it.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:29.800]  I believe that many of these things have been applied. When you look at early reports on mind control and control defensive behavior, I've got a paper from 1972, it's a declassified defense intelligence agency paper.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:49.800]  It's 175 pages from, again, 1972, discussing methods for influencing human behavior using these areas that I find particularly interesting, electromagnetic energy, sound, and light, and along with affecting the spirit condition.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:59.800]  And there are public patents from the 50s where you project sound into the human middle ear without anyone else being able to hear it.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:05.800]  Now, Coke Machines in Tokyo, I had the CEO on, are projecting audio directly into your head.
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:19.800]  And I thought about this. In Shomer Tech, the big law enforcement catalog, and I put this in my film, Road to Tierney, talk about low tech. They say, oh, law enforcement uses this to disrupt crowds and to mess up political speakers.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:32.800]  And the cops are openly saying this. And it's the sonic nausea machine, the supersonic nausea, and it's funded torture people and prisons. And that's just a low-tech system being sold in the law enforcement catalog.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:44.800]  The way that happened is a joint protocol was evolved starting in the mid-80s between the Department of Justice, which opened the dialogue, with the Department of Defense, to try and get access to non-lethal weapons systems.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:57.800]  And they had a series of conferences we documented in the book, Controlling the Human Mind, and through these conferences, they recognized that they really probably ought to keep these things open because the public would immediately be suspicious.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:06.800]  Well, of course, the next call. Exactly. Who was the big, before I forget under baggage, I think it was the head of the Air Force. It was about a month ago.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:21.800]  It was September 13th, you're right. Yeah, and said, we need to use our microwave guns on the American people because then that hides it, this was in the Associated Press, then that hides it in plain view and convinces foreigners it's okay to use in war.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:31.800]  So now they're deploying these to the police departments, and then meanwhile, people ask what Camp X-ray is because they admit everybody there is totally innocent, and then they came out and admitted it is a mind-control laboratory.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:47.800]  But sorry, go ahead. Yeah, and these, the dish that's being on the top of these humvees produces radio frequency energy in the microwave range, and what they didn't bother to tell anyone is that by adjusting the frequency pulse rate or intensity of the beam,
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:59.800]  you can have a much different effect than just crowd control, heating on the surface of the skin. You know, we reported on that device in 1999, in December 1999, in the book, Earth Rising the Revolution.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:14.800]  And what we said is, based on what had been done by the Air Force at the University of Utah when they developed the radio frequency dosimetry handbook, the big thick 400 page book, showing the dosages of radio frequency necessary to override every vital organ of the body.
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:20.800]  It's only a matter of tuning. I mean, the operator can have a ninth grade education to know which button to pull.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.800]  Oh no, they admit that it goes from narrow beam, which will hurt you, to wide beam for just causing excruciating pain.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:35.800]  And I mean, next, and I saw DARPA talk about this, we'll just have the microwave towers, but just in case we have a riot, they just flip the switch.
[01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:45.800]  And this also allows a tiny elite, a tiny group, even the police and military don't follow their orders for tyranny, a tiny group has these automated systems.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:55.800]  That's correct. And you know, we also looked at another paper. This is an unpublished paper. It's by one of the world's leading physicists and biophysics.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:04.800]  It's called the Danger Benefits of Encounter Measures for Artificial and Natural Specific Frequency and Wave Form Magnetic Field Interaction with Biological Systems.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:12.800]  Stay there. Stay there. All over the country. All over the country. They got monkeys and other mammals strapped up constantly testing it.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:19.800]  And it's all being tested to be used on you.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:48.800]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:59.800]  Let me put it in layman's terms. DARPA in the military, i.e. the government, is funding over 80% of the raw research going on at major universities.
[01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:06.800]  And my friend is in a high-level position at the UT Psychology Department. That's all I'll say.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:18.800]  And a few years ago, I was given a tour of it, of the non-classified areas, and it was all at the entrance to each of these labs, and these are research labs, aren't students involved, or in some cases graduate students assist.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:25.800]  You will have posted on the door who's funding it. DARPA. DARPA. DARPA. Department of Defense. Air Force. Army.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:34.800]  And they weren't hiding it. Across the street that's monitored by cameras, across the street they have got a whole underground building just full of monkeys.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:47.800]  And they put wires into their brain. They strap them in front of the screens. And it's a huge, just endless project, just testing the flickering rate of televisions to register brainwaves on monkeys.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:55.800]  And they admit that is then used by the government. They don't ask why. Again, we know television puts you into a mesmerized state.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:04.800]  That's admitted video games in an even lower state because of the concentration involved combined with the flicker. And Dr. Beggus is an expert on all that.
[01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:15.800]  Okay, I remember the Baltimore Sun about four years ago saying, oh, there's a plan with DARPA to put up towers that will put out different wavelengths of energy to soothe crowds during crises.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:26.800]  So imagine, people put these in. They don't even know what they're putting in. They're now going into mechanized, I wouldn't call them robots, but mainly remote control mini tanks, combat droids.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:37.800]  These are being used in Iraq. The South Koreans just came out with a policeman robot and they show video of it threatening to blow people's heads off.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:48.800]  For a tiny elite, you thought they were bad on 9-11 flying remote control planes into buildings with hijackers who were really U.S. government agents thinking they were taking part in a drill, an infiltration drill.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:56.800]  Just like the BATF practices taking bombs on planes, the same thing was an infiltration drill. I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:04.800]  Okay, these grids are going in for control. Dr. Beggus, am I exaggerating? Am I kidding? I mean, what does your research show?
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:11.800]  No, in fact, you're dead on right. Starting with the flicker rate on television, this is something people don't recognize. You know, subliminals.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:20.800]  Words that you hide in the screen were made illegal back in the 50s when they used to use them in movie theaters to get you to buy more soda pop and popcorn.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:28.800]  And what happened is they realized that this violated the rules because it bypasses the conscious, goes right into the subconscious.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:38.800]  And according to Shmirnoff at the Psycho Correction Institute, now part of the Russian Academy of Sciences, he actually said that it's so compelling, it's like a commandment of God.
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:51.800]  It cannot be disobeyed. But getting rid of that, you remember the first Bush election where Junior was running and they got caught using a subliminal where he used the word wrath and an ad talking about Democrats.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:12:00.800]  He got caught and he said, oh, it was a mistake. It was the advertised company. Well, there's more to it than that. The flicker rate is even more important because here's what they can do with just an advertisement.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:18.800]  You're sitting there watching passively. Your brain goes into this passive state. If you maintain a light flicker rate based on the changing of the scene at a certain pulse rate, the brain will go into a very suggestive state, almost a hypnotic type state where then the message, the overt message,
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:28.800]  just what's spoken and everyone can hear, nothing hidden, will be absorbed and integrated into the subconscious. And most people who sit on the fence on most issues, it's enough to push them over the edge.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:40.800]  And when you see billions of billion dollars spent in the presidential election, everyone involved in advanced research in psychology and advanced research in advertising understands these principles and applies them.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:51.800]  Well, here's an example. Six years ago, this is one of the highly publicized ones, remember Toyota ran a group of ads in Europe and a group of film students were slowing it down frame by frame.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:59.800]  And it was talking about kill your baby, bloody baby, bloody moon, human sacrifice. And folks, that was times of London. Okay, we're not kidding.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:11.800]  Now, when the company got caught, they said, well, our ad agency in London did it. And we don't mean this to be satanic. We found it gets your attention when you see your baby is going to die, which it does.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:22.800]  So it's a way to force you when you see that subconscious, your brain reads it. Suddenly, you get attention. Now, I've seen this with other people, children, my own children, my children hardly ever watch television.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:32.800]  A few times they're able to see network news or ads, especially when they were young, because they were so innocent, one of them would start crying and be scared, especially baby Einstein.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:42.800]  There's definitely stuff in that, folks. They would turn it off, turn it off, please. And that's why we don't really let them watch TV now, because there are subliminals in it all, folks.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:53.800]  Right. You know, there's very simple methods are really applied. It's just mainly dealing with the flicker rate or the oscillations within the broadcast signal. You can do a lot.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:14:02.800]  There's actually a paper, and I'm sure you've reported on it, was from the spring of 98 in perimeters, the U.S. Army War College, quarterly, called The Mind Has No Firewalls.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:13.800]  And they illustrated the best with a one-line statement where they say, and I quote, a psychotronic generator which produces a powerful electromagnetic emanation capable of being sent through telephone lines, TV radio networks,
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:29.800]  supply pipes, and incandescent lamps. This signal would manipulate the behavior of those in contact with the signal. In other words, any electromagnetic carrier can be used to sort of piggyback another signal that affects us on an emotional level.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:40.800]  And then now they have authorized or using it information transmission over power lines, which can also easily mask and be a carrier signal for the main signal.
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:50.800]  That's exactly right. And it came up actually in a documentary I participated in. It was by CBC TV, which is the public television in Canada on a show called Undercurrents.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:59.800]  In fact, their highest rated segment ever run was the one they ran on Mind Control, where they interviewed me, Smirnoff, the Morris's, a number of other people.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:12.800]  But the Morris's were interesting. They were the ones who went to the Reagan White House with decline and proposed this whole initiative in non-lethal weapons that eventually became, in fact, the very systems we're talking about.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:20.800]  And their real name is less lethal, but they've changed it to non-lethal, but we see how non-lethal they are at the Red Sox game where they blow the girl's head off.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:36.800]  Right. You know, non-lethal is a loose term. When we testified in February 5, 1998 in the European Parliament on non-lethal weapons, as a guest of the European Parliament, we got a resolution passed on security and disarmament.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:43.800]  Within that resolution were three sections on harp, and then the fourth section, the most important from my perspective, reads as follows.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:50.800]  It's from the European Parliament Resolution A40005 forward flash 99, and it says, and I quote,
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:16:01.800]  It calls for an international convention and introducing a global ban on all developments and deployments of weapons which might enable any form of manipulation of human beings.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:14.800]  Now, to get the European Parliament to put that into a piece of legislation meant that we had to evidence it in a substantial way, and each paragraph of the resolution was passed by a vote.
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:22.800]  And what happened is we formed a coalition starting with conservatives who understand civil liberties from a very, very different perspective.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:32.800]  Then the Greens got involved for environmental considerations, and then the Social Democrats got involved. And in Europe, that's kind of like the Republicans and Democrats shaking hands.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:46.800]  And we got it passed by the highest percentages, and it's because we actually demonstrated in the hearing an infosound device, a device to transfer sound through the nervous system into the brain where you hear that proverbial voice in the head.
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:54.800]  And we suggested at that hearing that the United States would soon develop a wireless method, if they hadn't already, using microwaves.
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:15.800]  And last year, if people were paying attention, Woody Norris won the MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lemelson Prize for microwave heterodining, where he actually transferred voice just like people hear us today and dropped it right into the heads of an individual at a distance in a way that was never done before.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:23.800]  Now, he's one of the guys that runs, actually owns a company, it's publicly traded, it's called ATCO, ATCO is in the symbol, and you can look it up.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:34.800]  They've sold a number of these active denial systems to the military, and now you have the caveat of, hey, you can do this too. And that's how the technology is developing, is we're learning.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:47.800]  And as you said, 44 of the world's biggest hundred economies are not governments, they're corporations, we know they're heavily investing in secret espionage, counter espionage, and non-lethal weapons systems.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:55.800]  Right, and you know, it's not just because of, I mean, think about it from an advertising perspective, and think about it from a political perspective. The idea...
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:11.800]  Well, look, their argument is we have to develop it and use it or somebody else with, that's always their excuse. We know it's a criminal group, as Mr. Steele, you know, high level former CIA said yesterday, now about 30% of the economy is now totally criminal.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:20.800]  It's taking over the other 70%, and they're going to use this against us, they are using it against us, and we're in deep trouble.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:29.800]  Well, and it's just part of them, you know, as we looked at technology over the last 12 years and have written our material and compiled it, you know, there's a lot more to come, I can tell you that.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:42.800]  We're putting together a conference of people, a closed conference, actually, a closed conference of the good guys, and we're bringing together eight or nine of the top scientists that I've met in my career that have risen and fallen.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:53.800]  In other words, they've been challenged because they've challenged authority and been beaten down and risen out of the ashes of those defeats and the much more powerful and strong individuals who maintain their character.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:11.800]  In those tough times, we're bringing a number of biophysicists, and physicists, these are some of the top rated in their field in the world, and they've agreed to come to a closed conference in Dallas being hosted by the Lay Institute on Technology, which is a non-profit, Dallas non-profit,
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:22.800]  a Texas based non-profit that I serve as executive director of, and also I serve on the board, and it was founded by Dorothy Lay, whose family is well known in Texas.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:33.800]  She was the daughter and is the daughter of Herman Lay, who founded Lay Potato Chips and Merger with Frito and later PepsiCo, and she is so interested in these impacts on technology.
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.800]  Well, you've got to be.
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:45.800]  And she's decided that funding the public education effort to make sure that there's a good discussion and the direction of these technologies might be better said.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:54.800]  And what we found in all of this work is by bringing these experts together, and a few years ago they probably would not have come, but there's enough data now.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:06.800]  I've had two physicists review the book, Controlling the Human Mind, tops in biophysics, that say it's the best material written not just for lay people, but it's written in plain language in a way that everyone can understand.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:12.800]  But the footnotes are so compelling that it's exactly what's been needed for years to kick off this debate.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:26.800]  And Sonoma State University, which runs Project Censored, this week is releasing a study of a compilation of literature on this issue of mind control with the intent to push this issue into the public forum.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:35.800]  The Washington Post is scheduled for a cover story in the Washington Post magazine where we'll be quoted in February on the mind control issue.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:46.800]  So the mainstream is even starting to pay attention because people when they look at this issue, I don't care where your political background is, the domain of the human mind is sacred.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:21:07.800]  Look, it's simple. If we allow cloistered elites, the crime syndicate, to develop this which they have and then to implement which they are implementing boys and girls, their way past research and embedded testing in these systems, it's being used, it's going on, everybody knows there's something wrong, big time.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:16.800]  And this is it. This is the end of society, the end of freedom. This is the matrix. And again, there's so many levels to propaganda. There's the social conditioning.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:26.800]  Then you couple the social conditioning images through television with the flicker rate, which then directs it directly into the subconscious and blocks out any cognitive dissidents to what they're doing.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:37.800]  Now, Dr. Beckett's though getting conscious of this control and really not letting yourself fall back into that mesmerized state that sleepwalking states so many are under.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:52.800]  I mean, is that one of the effective things we can each individually do in our own lives to start becoming conscious and also removing the one eyed monster that sits in our living rooms and literally restricting it only to research, which is what I do.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:22:00.800]  I have to watch certain clips, certain things that were said, but I literally take it very serious. And folks, this isn't a joke. I'm being very serious here.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:09.800]  I watch TV in a very controlled manner and I even catch myself after a few minutes getting relaxed, setting back into, I mean, folks, this is serious.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:17.800]  I think when you look at sort of the low tech approaches, just fatiguing the population, getting us worn out.
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800]  Terror, terror, terror, terror.
[01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:32.800]  Yeah, and then fears are next thing. And if you look at the brain activity under fear and that kind of stress and anxiety, you get what are referred to as incoherent brain patterns, the kind that don't lend themselves to good thinking.
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:46.800]  On the other hand, when you experience the positive emotions, love, empathy, compassion, you find that the brain falls into these very rhythmic patterns, the kind that are apparent when you're involved in highly intellectual or creative work.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:57.800]  Delicious. When we're calm and focused, we can actually direct the traffic around us in a much more way, better way than the flight and flight response of an agitated personality.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:05.800]  And people know this, propagandists know this. And so the red alert and the yellow alert and the orange alert is all about agitating the population.
[01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.800]  So the six o'clock news when you come home.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.800]  It's lomo fascist, it's lomo fascist, it's lomo fascist.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:16.800]  Right, and it just feeds right into that subconscious and ends up, then every event that sort of amplifies that effect.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:27.800]  And when you look back historically, you can look at the document, the Revolution, military affairs in conflict, short of war, which Maxwell Air Force Base in 84 talked about these technologies.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:43.800]  You can go back to 1989 US Army War College and at the Revolution, military affairs in conflict, short of war, that talked about all these new technologies sort of emerging that would violate and fall in the face of American values and would be resisted.
[01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:50.800]  Well, you know, at the US Army War College, you would think at that point, well, it doesn't fit American values, can't do it, but that's not what they did.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:57.800]  The rest of that report, in fact, the copy of that report is on the CD-ROM that goes with the...
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:09.800]  Yeah, let's be clear. Everybody's got to get the video, Mind Control, the Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance because it's a book in and of itself because it comes with a CD-ROM with thousands of pages and documents.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:24.800]  And it's all footnoted in the film. I mean, we've done this online with Marshall Law. My last big film, you know, a volunteer did it. He went and found every article we cited, every document we cited, and then on timecode did it online at Marshall Law 911.info.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:35.800]  Dr. Begich includes with the DVD film another CD that has all the documents. This is invaluable for especially professors and teachers and law enforcement personnel.
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:44.800]  Everybody needs to be aware of these technologies. They are being used against us right now. Many of them are. And folks are available at infowars.com right now.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:55.800]  Get the book, get the film. The film's the best to get the film and the CD-ROM. When you get the film, available at infowars.com, we're by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:05.800]  That's mind control, a brave new world, or enhancing human performance DVD, the book, controlling the human mind, the technologies, political control, or tools for peak performance.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  And let's briefly talk about peak performance. You put a positive thing there. We had Wired Magazine about six years ago, an article called The Marshall Plan, a pun, but it was the Pentagon Futurist, 80-something years old.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:33.800]  Looks like Dr. Evil. Mr. Marshall saying in the future, it won't be what weapons we have, but what drugs and what systems we have our soldiers under, and it's talking about literally the bionic man.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:41.800]  And now I've talked to Special Forces and other families in the military. My friend, they told me they were going to get the chip. Now they've told me they've gotten the chip.
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:26:01.800]  Right. This was, you can see it again, 1989. It's in the Revolutionary Military Affairs Conflict, short of war. And that document basically said the only way these new technologies would be allowed, or be permitted, or be accepted by the American population, was an environment of fear created by international terrorism and international drug trafficking.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:14.800]  All they were waiting was for an event, and 9-11 gave them their event, and then they basically began to implement the control of this population, a way that no civilization has ever seen before.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:32.800]  You're under attack from every angle, from the social worker trying to grab your children, Dr. Begich clearly having his father killed, to the daughter of the 77 pilot being firebombed. We're under attack, ladies and gentlemen. They're not playing games. It's about survival. Stay with us.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:27:01.800]  Okay, I want to take a call or two. We're under Nick Begich. We'll be with us five minutes to the next hour. The pastor's book pause joining us, because he found out about some mind control type stuff.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:15.800]  The group retina scanning and thumb printing the children at the schools in West Virginia and nationwide is the human experimentation group out of the university. I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:35.800]  Dr. Begich, I think really the biggest illustration of how evil this elite is, is the admissions of black men to ski, the atomic soldiers, project Shad, nerve-gassing our own troops. You know well about it. You've written about it. I mean, this is a cold-blooded technocracy that sees humans as a scourge, and a human life is cheaper than dirt.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:45.800]  And so folks, I think, don't need to judge the world according to their own meek view. They need to see it from these inbred elitists.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:28:01.800]  You know, that whole issue of where it's gone, it is gone much further than anything that most anticipated. You know, the chemical means and the old methods have been replaced now with much more sophisticated technologies that can dial in to the human brain,
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:17.800]  almost the same as dialing in to radio stations. I mean, it's that precision. What's coming in what we talk about in the book is the full integration of mind and consciousness with computers, something that they're actually actively pursuing.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  The idea of being able to interface the human brain with a computer directly, that's the direction we're going. In other words, figuring out enough about how information transfers to the brain to replicate it.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:44.800]  They're using three supercomputers next year in Switzerland. Tied together, they'll start to look at the human brain. And one of these supercomputers, to do the same thing that it does in a second, would take 6.6 billion people and calculators 60 hours to accomplish.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:29:03.800]  Now, at the same time, we have these elites basically combining their resources because of them, it's about total domination. And so what percentage of the total defense budget, as many other funding sources, is pumped into this under different hospices?
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:13.800]  Well, you know, it's literally billions of dollars. I mean, black projects and the Air Force equipment budget alone amount to about 40% of their budget as of the late 90s.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.800]  Looking at it, isn't it over a trillion dollars in the last 50 years?
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:36.800]  Probably easily that. I mean, I would say easily that because these are crossover technologies. They affect a lot of different areas. And when you start to look at them and literally connect the various technologies, which is what we try to do, you can see how that literal matrix appears on the planet.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:47.800]  And it's a technology matrix, you know, and I talk about, and for 12 years, I've been talking about technology. And during the break, we were talking about the fact that, you know, I've been doing this a long time.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:58.800]  We've been covering these issues a long time trying to get them out. And fortunately, fortunately, programs like this give us a chance to get into these issues and debate them.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:12.800]  Well, there is a dual edge. You know, DARPA invented what the Internet is today, and it's double-edged sword, which they thought would be, you know, a worldwide wiretap has turned out to be something that's really, you know, causing the globalist problems.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:37.800]  You talk about the first, you know, inorganic brain, billions of humans on the Internet uploading information, photos, integrating, has turned Google really into a type of artificial intelligence that's an artificial intelligence once it merges with people interfacing with it and has created a giant, global, independent intelligence complex that is rivaling anything the government can put together.
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:48.800]  In fact, they funded some of the seed money for that whole operation, but you're right. I mean, it's a better system than the government has, and it's been, the government system has been widely criticized for their inefficiency.
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:58.800]  You know, technology, technology in 21st century is, in fact, where the action is. In democratic republics like ours, it's either going to make us slaves or make us free.
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:10.800]  Absolutely. Folks, get the DVD, and it comes with a free CD with all the documents and proof on it. Mind Control, the Brave New World, or enhancing human performance, and the book. It's available at infowars.com.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:32.800]  Or by calling this old free number, we'll be right back.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:55.800]  In Boston, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:10.800]  Pastor Butch Paul is going to be joining us coming up with very important revelations. I'm going to recap some of the top stories. Another huge director has gone public on 9-11. There's been a suspicious death. We'll be talking about all of it.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:23.800]  One hour is never enough time. We'll get Dr. Nick Beggach up in the next few weeks again if we can. We are carrying his new film, Mind Control. It's unbelievable. You need to get it. It's all documented.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:30.800]  Let's take a final call. Brian in Maryland. Thanks for holding. Go ahead. You're on the air with Dr. Nick Beggach.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:41.800]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing? I'd like to report a breaking news item from Maryland about a crisis management preparedness exercise.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:54.800]  So they're having another takeover drill? That's exactly right. It's going to happen in Bethesda area tomorrow, December 7th, between 10.30 a.m. and 3 o'clock p.m.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:04.800]  And personnel from various local and national emergency service organizations, hospitals, and military will be participating in the exercise.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:16.800]  And what that does is condition everybody to go under military control, the local constabulary to go under federal control. And all these constant drills, thousands of them in the news, creates the illusion of a real terror threat.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:22.800]  So it's also a form of operant conditioning or mind control. Dr. Beggach, would you like to speak to drills?
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:36.800]  Yeah, you know, it's all part of the conditioning, you know, process. You know, it's like very standard stuff. You know, you want to drill, drill, drill, because then when it does happen, people are, you know, more organized to follow the orders and follow the school.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.800]  I.e. Jim Jones and the Kool-Aid drills.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:47.800]  Yep. You know, and all of this stuff leads to people to do things that maybe otherwise they might not do, or they might click in the cognizant mind and start thinking a little bit more.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:52.800]  Have you seen all the reports of where they go into schools and scream at elementary students and put guns in their heads, unannounced?
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:34:04.800]  Oh, the nonsense has gotten totally out of control. It's about control, ultimately. You know, we've barely touched the surface of this issue, and I know we'll be doing it again soon, I hope.
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:08.800]  Well, that's a domestication trauma, trauma-based mind control. That's classic.
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:18.800]  Yep, yep, and it's kind of an old style, but when you have that going on and you overlay these other systems, you increase the efficiency of that dramatically.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:25.800]  Yes, up the nexus points, I mean, of all the different layers, from low-tech to high-tech, what is the most dominant or core?
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:34.800]  I think the biggest things are the electromagnetic systems where any carrier can be used. This is where the action is. This is where the breakthroughs are being made.
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:46.800]  On the flip side of this, we know that we can increase our human capacity in terms of mental capacity by 50 to 100% above what it is now with technologies that are available today.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:54.800]  And that's what's being lost in this shuffle, is we're using it to destroy humankind when we ought to be able to enhance our performance, enhance our capabilities.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.800]  We use 7 or 8% of our time.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:05.800]  But do it in a way that keeps the core of what it is to be human there. Instead, they're going into all the dark technologies meant to destroy humanity and take free will.
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:16.800]  That's exactly right. And to have these technologies individually, and I say that with emphasis, individually available where we could amp up our brains in ways that are unprecedented,
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.800]  and some of the ways that it's being done are very simple, and it's not like something coming in and controlling you.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:30.800]  It's you learning how to control that activity between our ears in a much more precision way, just like learning how to ride a bicycle.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:38.800]  And that kind of knowledge is out there. The very end of this book deals with some of that, the very end of the video, deals with some of this indefinitely.
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:42.800]  Let me tell the caller something real quick. Caller, will you send me an email about that? We'll post it.
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:45.800]  Yes, sir. I did. I sent it to Ryan.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.800]  Okay. Anything else?
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.800]  That's it, Alex. Thanks a lot. And thanks to both of you guys. You're right on.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.800]  Dr. Baggage, if I could do this, just keep you ten more minutes. I want to get Pastor Butch Paul on right now.
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:01.800]  And then I want him to tell you about what he discovered in West Virginia because it dovetails into everything you're talking about.
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.800]  Sounds great. You know, and I was just on with Pastor Butch.
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.800]  I heard you about a week and a half ago.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:08.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:22.800]  Yeah, I listened to the broadcast. All right, we'll be right back with Dr. Nick Baggage and a good old Pastor Butch.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.800]  We're going to take a look at the little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.800]  We fired our guns and the British kept coming. There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.800]  We fired once more and they forget to run it.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.800]  We're down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.800]  We looked down a river and we see the British come and they must have been a hundred of them beating on the drums.
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:06.800]  They stepped so high and they made the bugle ring. We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.800]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming. There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:19.800]  We fired once more and they began to run it. We're down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:25.800]  Old Hickree said we could take them by surprise if we didn't fire muskies till we looked them in the eye.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:31.800]  We held our fire till we see their faces well. Then we opened up the squirrel guns and really gave them well.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:36.800]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming. There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:44.800]  We fired once more and they began to run it. We're down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.800]  Yeah, they ran through the priors and they ran through the brambles and they ran through the bushes where rabbit couldn't go.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them all. We're down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.800]  We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down so we grabbed an alligator and we pulled another round.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.800]  We filled his head with cannonballs and piled our kids behind and when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:17.800]  We fired our guns and the British kept becoming. There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:24.800]  We fired once more and they began to run it. We're down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:31.800]  Yeah, they ran through the priors and they ran through the brambles and they ran through the bushes where rabbit couldn't go.
[01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:35.800]  I dedicate this song to Paul Watson. I'm just teasing.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.800]  Having a little bit of fun, you've got to joke around every once in a while.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.800]  Dr. Nick Beggage has agreed to stay with us through this segment and we've got Pastor Butch Pah on with us from West Virginia.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:49.800]  Butch, why don't you encapsulate it for Dr. Nick Beggage, the world expert, really, I have to say,
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:57.800]  a wide spectrum analysis of these emerging and well-developed technologies of control.
[01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:03.800]  All over the country, universities and law enforcement groups are getting federal grants, the thumb scan, retina scan the children.
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:06.800]  They basically come in and force it on the kids.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:09.800]  The parents, a lot of times, are sent the letter the day before.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:13.800]  I know it's for their safety. We're just getting them into the system.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.800]  This is all part of the control and then you discovered the group doing it was tied into human experimentation.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:24.800]  The name of protecting the children, of course, and now I have a whole bunch of documents on that subject.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:26.800]  Introduce us to this, Pastor Butch.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.800]  Sure, and thank you, Alex, for having me. I appreciate it. How's that, Dr. Nick? How are you doing?
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.800]  I'm doing good. It's good to be talking to you again. I didn't think it would be quite so soon,
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.800]  and I certainly didn't expect to be running into you on the traffic corner of Alex Jones' show.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.800]  That's a busy corner, too, by the way.
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.800]  Yeah, it is. It sounds that way. It's good to be talking with both of you guys again today.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.800]  Well, anyway, to get on this very topic, now, I have, literally beside me,
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.800]  literally beside me in the hard copy, over a thousand pages of documentation,
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.800]  and I'm sure there's probably ten times more than that out there if I had the poor to get it all out here.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:01.800]  But what brought this to my attention was a form that I received back in August.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.800]  It's called Amberview. I'm sure every school in the nation is doing this.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:11.800]  It's returning children to the safety of their families, prenatal or garden consent and information form.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.800]  The prints filled out, they send this in with the children. They're retina scan, thumb scan,
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.800]  put into the FBI database.
[01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.800]  Yeah, I forgot. A lot of schools like Westlake now here in Austin make you do it,
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.800]  and the parents have to thumb scan and retina scan to get in to get your children.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:31.800]  It's a literal prison now, but let's talk about who's behind this.
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:35.800]  Well, as I read this paper that was given to me, I looked up at the right-hand corner,
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.800]  top right-hand corner, small print. You have a coffee in front of you there, Alex.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.800]  This is from the West Virginia Post. This is very carefully.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.800]  And I have massive documentation to prove this.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:46.800]  Yeah, I spent hours looking through it.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:54.800]  West Virginia University Institution Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.800]  And right here in front of me, too, is a bill introduced in 1997 by Senator John Wynn,
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:03.800]  Human Research Subject Protections Act, 1997.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:10.800]  Another page here is the Belmont Report on the ethical principles and guidelines
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.800]  for protection of human subjects of research.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  I'm looking, and I'm not gargling. We can spend hours this federal-wise.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.800]  And basically, when you sign this, you wave your kids into being experimentation,
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.800]  and people think they're signing their kid up for a safety program,
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.800]  and now they're trying to say, oh, you've got to do it. This is incredible. Please continue.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:34.800]  And I also have a friend of mine here from the Healthy Human Services website.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:38.800]  The underwriters, subcommittees, as you can see, all the people involved in this,
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.800]  and my goodness, it's a three- to four-page document,
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.800]  involved in this are the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture,
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.800]  every federal department you think of is involved in this.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.800]  The reason it's Veterans Affairs is they admit they're tracking them
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:55.800]  and their scores for enlistment later.
[01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.800]  But that's one small part. Go ahead.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:01.800]  That is overwhelming.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.800]  This article, April 19, 1979, the summary of this article,
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.800]  for the National Commission for Protection of Human Subjects,
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:12.800]  Biomedical and Behavioral Research, on July 12, 1974,
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:15.800]  the National Research Act was signed in law
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.800]  thereby creating a National Commission for Protection of Human Subjects,
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.800]  Biomedical and Behavioral Research.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.800]  But all of that is wave. It's like the UN Declaration of Human Rights
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:27.800]  gives you all these rights until 29 and section 30,
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:35.800]  because under U.S. Code Title 50, Chapter 32, subsection 1520A, paragraph B,
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:38.800]  it authorizes the use of chemical and biologicals, even lethal,
[01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:41.800]  in quote research on the American people.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.800]  Let's get Dr. Beggage to jump in here real quick before you continue, butch.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:49.800]  You know, this whole issue of human experimentation has come up periodically.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:55.800]  We mentioned it in Earth, Rights, and Revolution when the administration of Bill Clinton
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:59.800]  admitted that over half a million Americans, Secretary of Energy O'Leary,
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.800]  said that over half a million Americans have been unwitting victims of human experimentation.
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:08.800]  And, you know, these kinds of consent forms that they're trying to get parents to sign,
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:12.800]  people need to look very, very closely when it comes to your children,
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.800]  because historically, children have been used in human experiments.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:21.800]  And they've admitted it. And the fact is, when they admit a half a million,
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:26.800]  you can multiply that by 10 or 20 and get maybe close, but maybe not.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.800]  I mean, I think that this is the problem is, why should the government be able to announce
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.800]  that we've had a half a million unwitting victims of human experiments in the United States
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.800]  and nobody being jailed?
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:39.800]  The government doesn't fall.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.800]  Yeah, I mean, it's basically they grant immunity to these folks, they hide who they are.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.800]  The end of the day is, it's all about accountability.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:50.800]  And it's neat to flip the other direction.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.800]  We need the transparent government, not an opaque one,
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.800]  filled with too much smoke and mirrors to find the truth.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.800]  We need the kind of open government.
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.800]  Well, here's an analogy. The cop pulls you over for no reason and wants to search your car,
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.800]  quote, because we're in a post-911 world.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:06.800]  How about we search the government?
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:10.800]  I mean, these people killed us over and over again, premeditatedly.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.800]  They can't be trusted. Now, but continue with what you found.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:18.800]  Well, as I looked through this, these massive amounts of documents have been from me.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:21.800]  As a matter of fact, I was on a computer listening to Dr. Nick talk, I've digged up some more.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:27.800]  They are now saying that they're explaining who are considered children,
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.800]  and they want to basically right now go with wards of the state.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.800]  Children who maybe had no parents will say they are in the VPS service systems.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.800]  Well, that came out of New York papers where they make the little black kids drink pesticides till they die.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:43.800]  That's right. This should not be an infirmary.
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:46.800]  I've got thousands of pages here. I'm telling you folks, this is for real.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:52.800]  And they also said that because ethics change, they can go further into this as time goes along.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:56.800]  In other words, the principles and laws of it by today will change tomorrow,
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:02.800]  so we'll continue this research in more depth as the people are more immoral.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:06.800]  And then I talked to the principal up there in Michigan where they put the guns to the kids' heads,
[01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.800]  unannounced as they wet themselves crying and begging,
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.800]  and he said, oh, this is good training for them.
[01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.800]  You see how mutated that principal's brain is, Dr. Baggich?
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:22.800]  Yeah, absolutely. Trauma-based conditioning is a classic method of controlling the human brain.
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:29.800]  And the fact of the matter is, when you look at this and you see just the overt nature of it,
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.800]  traumatizing children is not the answer.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:35.800]  In fact, just the opposite. Children need a nurturing.
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:40.800]  You have kids, and I have five children, and I know that kids do not need a trauma.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:46.800]  I mean, we have enough trauma coming at us just by living our normal lives to inflict it on children.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:53.800]  Somebody belongs, not in the principal's office, they belong in jail for this kind of stuff.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.800]  Well, Nick, the reason I like having you on is I can mention an article and you've read it,
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:01.800]  and you even know more than I do on this subject, and I'm one of the people who knows more than almost anybody,
[01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:06.800]  because I research it every day, and you know, I'm sitting here, and I mean,
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.800]  I remember reading New York Daily News, folks, they take little black kids and they kill them.
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.800]  I mean, they murder them, and this is not hidden.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.800]  Okay, and finally, CPS workers move the whistle, so we heard about it,
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.800]  but then the state granted the biomedical companies doing the test protection.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.800]  I mean, this isn't stopping, folks, and I'm sick of it.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:29.800]  Does anybody out there think you're safe while these psychopaths are running things,
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.800]  and they got a bunch of idiots and uniforms to enforce whatever they say?
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.800]  Dr. Baggage?
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.800]  Absolutely true.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:41.800]  You know, there's an article, and it was the Washington Times, September 29th, 1994,
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.800]  and this is the quote,
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.800]  children and orphanages were used to test experimental vaccines
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:50.800]  for the theory and whooping cough for several decades after World War II,
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.800]  and then it goes on at least 500,000 people were used in the Cold War era,
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:59.800]  radiation, biological and chemical experiments sponsored by the federal government,
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:03.800]  a congressional agency said yesterday, this is from a 1997 report.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:07.800]  This shows up in our book from 1999, Earth Rising and Revolution,
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:14.800]  and orphanages, prisoners, minorities, people who essentially were considered disenfranchised
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:18.800]  from the mainstream population were the ones who became the victims.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.800]  And you know, this whole sense, I mean, we hung people at Nuremberg in Germany
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.800]  after World War II for these very same offenses,
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:32.800]  and then the CIA brought 700 Nazi scientists over here to continue this work
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.800]  in this country for the last 60 years.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:37.800]  It's time to end the tyranny.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  It's time to get mad.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:42.800]  Actually, we're doing much worse in Hitler than every dream we're doing.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.800]  I have here a draft that I sent a house copy of.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.800]  I'll tell you what, but cover it when we get back,
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:48.800]  because I'm going to let Dr. Baggage go now,
[01:47:48.800 --> 01:47:50.800]  and so you can have the rest of the time to cover this.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.800]  Dr. Baggage, we'll talk to you again real soon.
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:54.800]  Huge 9-11 news just broke.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.800]  It's breaking.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:01.800]  Another huge Hollywood power has gone public on 9-11 on national TV today.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.800]  We just learned of it.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.800]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.800]  This is huge.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.800]  Dr. Baggage, thanks for coming on.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.800]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:09.800]  Take care.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800]  You bet.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800]  I mean, this is an exciting day.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:13.800]  It was David Lynch, the huge director earlier.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:20.800]  Now, we'll cover something just as big on the other side.
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:23.800]  Oh, praise God, it's coming out.
[01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:26.800]  Oh, man.
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:28.800]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:57.800]  What would you do if you knew all the things we knew?
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:10.800]  Oh, would you turn away from me, and then what if you don't?
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.800]  I see a message from the government.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:16.800]  Like every day, I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.800]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:21.800]  Picture me buying this scam, I said never.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.800]  You ain't going through a hard truth, so just spit it.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.800]  I stay committed, give up because I lose commission.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:29.800]  It's all a part of fighting devil state mind control.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.800]  And all about the battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.800]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:37.800]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us days and rapists.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:40.800]  Another push, season, mean another war for profit.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  All a secret, so the public never fit to stop it.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:45.800]  The Illuminati triple six, all connected.
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:48.800]  Stole a post, they control the race and take elections.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.800]  It's the Skull and Bones remakes and kill committee.
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.800]  See the dragon get in every city.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.800]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.800]  Pastor Butch Paul is our guest and I apologize to him
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:01.800]  because he's bringing us such vital info.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:04.800]  He's been researching this for the last month when he discovered it.
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.800]  It integrates in with everything we're talking about today.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:11.800]  On the view, huge national broadcast TV show.
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.800]  James Borden, we've gotten a bunch of emails about this.
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.800]  We're confirming it right now, but it is confirmed he was a guest today.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:21.800]  He just broke 9-11 Truth on the top rated TV show, The View.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:24.800]  At the end of his stint on the program show, he announced to the audience
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:27.800]  the website 9-11-weno.com.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.800]  And I've gone to the site.
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.800]  It exposes 9-11 Inside Job.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.800]  And so now James Borden, and that's the big Hollywood actor, producer,
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:40.800]  husband of Barbara Streisand has gone public.
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.800]  Earlier today, we just discovered that over the weekend on national Dutch television,
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:53.800]  another huge individual, director and producer, went public there as well.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.800]  We'll tell you more about that before the broadcast ends.
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:58.800]  Pastor Butch, this is exciting.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:02.800]  I mean, the evil's coming down on us, but more and more people are having the courage to speak up.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:03.800]  Is it not amazing?
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.800]  Absolutely.
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.800]  It's exciting, but a little bit scary too because other side is not going to back up.
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.800]  I wonder what the next move's going to be.
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.800]  You know, I want to talk about you personally.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:16.800]  I know you can't talk about a lot of it because it was classified, but I mean, you volunteered for Vietnam.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:22.800]  You were in covert operations in countries around Vietnam.
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:23.800]  You did a lot of things.
[01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.800]  I mean, back then, I've heard you talk about it.
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:28.800]  You totally believed patriotism was doing whatever the government said.
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.800]  What did you say to police and military that are serving the Black Dragon?
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.800]  Well, I will say, I didn't volunteer for Vietnam, but yes, I was a Vietnam communications expert.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:44.800]  And I would pray with everything in me, these people would quit walking blindly behind these leaders and take a look at what's going on.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:50.800]  I know for a fact, when I was there, the CIA was flying in massive amounts of drugs in Vietnam.
[01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:51.800]  They did it.
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:58.800]  They stuffed the caskets full of drugs, shipped them home to the U.S. or where they're shipped them to as dead soldiers.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.800]  And I thought it was okay because I was an American service man.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:08.800]  Now, let's be clear. I mean, you're not just all the other CIA guys we've had on who had met it or seen the Bushes involved.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:12.800]  No, no, you were there. You were there and knew about this.
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:20.800]  I was stationed in partly in New York, Thailand, next to the largest airport base in South East Asia at the time.
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.800]  And these planes flew in out there all the time.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:24.800]  I mean, it was no big secret.
[01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.800]  I mean, it was like you couldn't have the health in the front room.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.800]  Everyone knew it was there.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:31.800]  They just ignored it.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:36.800]  There's no big deal. Everybody thought that we were doing well because we're Americans and we were up to the gooks.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:39.800]  We were up to the bad guys, just as are in Iraq today.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.800]  That's why they take children in, Alex.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.800]  That's why they take 19-year-old boys in and girls in.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:47.800]  They're naive and their mom and dad fought in World War II.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.800]  They thought they did the right thing back then, too.
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.800]  So naivety will destroy you.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  Hosea 4-6, my people, destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.800]  That's what's happened in this country.
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:52:59.800]  When did you wake up?
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:02.800]  About 1991.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:04.800]  What was it when Pastor Butch Bob?
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.800]  Then we'll go to break and come back and talk about the story.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:09.800]  What woke me up, I guess, was Randy Weaver.
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:11.800]  Was that 1991, 1992?
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:12.800]  Yeah, 1992, yeah.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.800]  Yeah, that's when I started to question what was going on.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:21.800]  And looking behind the scenes, and my gosh, the deeper I dug, the more it stunk.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:23.800]  And I realize now how deceived I was.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.800]  And I apologize to many people because of the deception I was involved in.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:31.800]  But I did it ignorantly. Now I'm trying to turn around and do something righteously.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.800]  Well, that's absolutely.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.800]  So you guys knew about the government dealing drugs,
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:37.800]  but it was just kind of like, well, we're the good guys.
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:38.800]  There must be a good reason for it.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:39.800]  Absolutely.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.800]  We trusted our government.
[01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:45.800]  One thing our forefathers warned us about, and so did the scriptures many times,
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.800]  never put trust in man.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:52.800]  Jeremiah 17.5 said, curse be the man that puts trust in man.
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.800]  It makes place his arm, restraint.
[01:53:54.800 --> 01:54:00.800]  We cursed ourselves through our ignorance and apathy with following man's and man's laws, ignoring God's laws.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.800]  Okay, let's get into this experimentation where they trick the parents when they sign up for security procedures
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:10.800]  with the retina scans and thumb scans to get your kids happening right here in Austin now,
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:12.800]  or in a suburb.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:17.800]  And you're really signing them up for human experimentation.
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.800]  We're on the march.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.800]  The empire's on the run.
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:25.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:56.800]  I wish that I could fly into the sky.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.800]  I'm very high.
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.800]  Just like a dragonfly.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:10.800]  I fly above the trees, over the seas, and on the breeze.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:13.800]  To anywhere I please.
[01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:19.800]  Oh, I want to get away.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:21.800]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:24.800]  This is the Info War on the Frontlines.
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:30.800]  Just like Paris was saying in the last segment, it's a battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.800]  The enemies of God and pre-humans traffic in the souls of men.
[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:38.800]  They brainwash you. They destroy your destiny.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:44.800]  They control your life. They make you petty, mindless creatures who only lost after the things of the world.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:47.800]  They take everything away from you, all of God's gifts.
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:54.800]  My friends, we are under attack, and we rise to the challenge with God's help to fight this new world order.
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:57.800]  That David Lynch has spoken out on 9-11.
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:02.800]  In fact, get that cued up. I want to play that before this segment ends and get Butch's take on it.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:07.800]  Saying there are many questions, no answers on 9-11, bringing up how the buildings fell, the hole at the Pentagon,
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:11.800]  and saying that the government could be involved in it.
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:17.800]  This aired just three days ago, Sunday on Dutch television. We just learned of it earlier today.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:21.800]  And then now, I'm cleaning all the calls out. We haven't taken a lot of calls today.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:24.800]  We will only take your call if you saw the view this morning.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:27.800]  We've gotten a bunch of emails on this. We've confirmed he was on the show.
[01:56:27.800 --> 01:56:30.800]  We're trying to confirm. He did say this. We're trying to get an audio clip of it.
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:34.800]  James Brolin just broke 9-11 Truth on the top rated TV show, The View.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:41.800]  At the end of his stint this morning show, he announced to the audience that the website, 9-11-Weno.com.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:46.800]  Thank you. That is massive right there. So it looks like the dam is breaking.
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:52.800]  We have to confirm that. Again, Charlie Sheen hit the bar bar first.
[01:56:52.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  Incredible courage. He was told to basically shut up.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.800]  And then they dropped all those lies on him after that. Just amazing courage.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.800]  He hit the bar bar first in that whole guild of people.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.800]  I mean, obviously there are former German defense ministers and former members of Congress.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:13.800]  And the members of Congress and all these high level people, you know, the head economist
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:18.800]  for the Department of Labor going public and the father of Reaganomics and the Reagan administration
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:21.800]  who headed up the Treasury Department, Dr. Paul Crick, Robert's going public.
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:28.800]  All these CIA people going public here on the show, widows, victims, firemen going public here.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:33.800]  But when you get big Hollywood people now, like Barbara Streisand's husband,
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:42.800]  who again has produced just been in hundreds of TV shows, been in scores of movies.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:49.800]  I mean, it's list in the hundreds here of the movies and films he's been in.
[01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:57.800]  And of course, that is James Brolin doing that. I mean, it is amazing.
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:02.800]  And before we go back to Butch, I had her schedule. I appreciate her coming on briefly.
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:07.800]  That is Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts, the Made in America water filters.
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.800]  They also have the British ones that you choose. They support patriotism. They support this broadcast.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:16.800]  And this is key. This is key.
[01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:21.800]  It's Made in America. They support this broadcast. And the water is full of poison, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:27.800]  Stop drinking it and you get the equivalent of what distributors are getting these for.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:32.800]  These are like 320 bucks in stores. You get them $195, $199.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:36.800]  If you want the really fancy one with all the bells and whistles, $259.
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:41.800]  Just free gifts with it. Sports bottle filters with the big unit.
[01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:45.800]  Takes a few minutes. Debbie, they're nuts if they don't call and get this.
[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:49.800]  They're insane if they don't call and order it for friends and family.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:52.800]  I mean, how many have I bought? I know it's more than 10 over the years.
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.800]  Just to give as gifts to family.
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:59:00.800]  In fact, just a month ago, we gave one to family. My parents did.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.800]  It's just absolutely essential. Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:05.800]  Hi, Alex. Thank you very much for having me.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.800]  You bet. Tell folks about Berkey and tell them how they get it.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:14.800]  Well, you can call us at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:19.800]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:24.800]  Or they can go to our website at www.berkeywater.com.
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:29.800]  It's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.800]  We do have a lot of holiday specials.
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:37.800]  Please give us a call and ask us what the Alex Jones holiday specials are.
[01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:41.800]  We'll be glad to answer any questions.
[01:59:41.800 --> 01:59:45.800]  Berkey water filters are gravity-fed water filters.
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:47.800]  They don't have to be plumbed in.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.800]  You can take them anywhere and use them in any water situations.
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:56.800]  They're for everyday use, as well as for in case of an emergency,
[01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.800]  and you need to use any type of local water.
[01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.800]  You are insane if you don't purify your water,
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:04.800]  and that doesn't mean some cheap charcoal thing
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:07.800]  that just takes out some of the dead bacteria and the bad flavor.
[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.800]  This is to non-detectable levels.
[02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:12.800]  If you use non-microscubs, they can't find bacteria,
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:15.800]  or what normally would show up in other filters, even their excrement.
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:19.800]  This is unprecedented, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.800]  You need to give them a call 888-803-4438,
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.800]  triple-8803-4438,
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:29.800]  or order via infoawards.com or berkeywater.com,
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:33.800]  and tell us what free gift you want in the comments section of potassium iodate
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:35.800]  to protect when there's a radiological event.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.800]  You take it at that time. Your pets can take it to your children.
[02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:40.800]  It's the medical core type that's recommended,
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.800]  so it doesn't make you upchuck it.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.800]  The type that gives the military doesn't work as even a grown man.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.800]  It's trouble holding it down if there is an attack.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:49.800]  There's portable sports bottles that make the water safe to drink,
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:52.800]  not completely pure, like the purifiers, the larger units.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.800]  Give her a call 888-803-4438.
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.800]  Debbie, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:00:58.800]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:00:59.800]  God bless you.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:00.800]  Bless you, too.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:02.800]  You bet. Going back to Pastor Butch, Paul Butch,
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.800]  let's continue with...
[02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:06.800]  You discover they make the parents,
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:09.800]  they make you like Westlake here in Austin, outside Austin,
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:12.800]  the richest area in the suburb of Austin.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:37.800]  Thumb scans, retina...
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.800]  Especially these people that say we should worship government
[02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:41.800]  and do whatever it says.
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:43.800]  I want you to tell them about that teaching, that video you did,
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:45.800]  render unto Caesar explained,
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:48.800]  but right now, please continue.
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.800]  I just hope Troy here in Westlake
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.800]  will listen to this program today.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.800]  You remember Troy?
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.800]  What do you think of him calling in and threatening to quote,
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:55.800]  to beat me up?
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:58.800]  Well, we have some jerks in this state, too, I'm afraid.
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.800]  What's he going to do when he finds out I'm running for governor in this state?
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.800]  He's going to scare him to death.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:06.800]  Anyway, and the topics I have here,
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:09.800]  and I sit this to you, some of these two used to be attacks,
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.800]  and later they're written by John C. Fletcher,
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.800]  that was not to be quoted or cited without permission,
[02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.800]  yet to contact some people, certain from them, to do this,
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:18.800]  in this letter.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:22.800]  Now, this insults me to know that our children, and us,
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:24.800]  not just the children, but now adults,
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:27.800]  are now considered human research subjects.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:29.800]  We're no longer people, actually,
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:31.800]  we're considered animals,
[02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:33.800]  many of my chapter 9 said that one day they would own our bodies.
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.800]  Well, now they do.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:38.800]  Back in 1998, President Clinton
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.800]  requested the NBAC to include implications of a reported attempt
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:45.800]  to fuse a human cell with a cow egg.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.800]  Researchers claim an embodied cell makes a human and cow.
[02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.800]  It goes on to say that if such a fusion did result
[02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:58.800]  in a primary organism that was not human embryo,
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:01.800]  then it saw no ethical problems of continued experiments.
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:06.800]  Also, from a speech made by a gentleman named Harlan Gerard,
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:10.800]  back in October, 1997, he said this,
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:13.800]  Now, I want to point out that we have an unblemished history
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.800]  of human experimentation, now dating 65 years ago,
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:18.800]  without relief.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.800]  I will tell you, you'll be happy to know,
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.800]  the government is no longer experimenting on the poor
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:23.800]  and the vulnerable.
[02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:25.800]  It's not experimenting on the nice, middle-class people
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:28.800]  like yourselves, psychologists, engineers, social workers,
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:31.800]  black, white, Asian, Christians, Jews, Buddhists,
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:33.800]  and it's an equal opportunity killer.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:36.800]  Now, this is for a man who was there and saw this and done this
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:38.800]  from an effective contact if it's possible.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.800]  Now, let's be clear though, let me stop you there.
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:43.800]  The reason they have to give their minions these documents
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:45.800]  is the average psychologist or psychiatrist
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:47.800]  or cops coming to grab your CPS workers,
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:50.800]  they've got to be given some signed piece of paper
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:52.800]  saying doing this is okay.
[02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:56.800]  Okay, so this is just a policy.
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.800]  Well, the policy doesn't legalize murder or torture.
[02:03:59.800 --> 02:04:02.800]  Well, and the same document here by John Fletcher says
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:06.800]  morals must be a growing science if it is to be a science at all,
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:10.800]  not really because all truth has not yet been appropriated
[02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.800]  by the mind of man, but because life is a moving affair
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:16.800]  in which an old moral truth ceases to apply.
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:19.800]  If you don't want to say that principles exist as a hypothesis
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:21.800]  with which to experiment.
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:23.800]  In other words, they're going to make this worse
[02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:25.800]  as time goes along, but they'll stop it.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.800]  They're tearing down all things.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:29.800]  And they're saying there's no moral.
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:31.800]  They say we're not bad doing this
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:33.800]  because we decide what's bad.
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:35.800]  We're the immoral ones now.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:36.800]  We're the ones crying out to stop this
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:38.800]  and we're the ones who now are being immoral
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:39.800]  because we're selfish.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:40.800]  We don't want to do these things
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.800]  because we believe it's wrong to murder
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.800]  and to pillage someone's mind
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.800]  or to destroy their bodies with drugs or whatever.
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:48.800]  This is pure evil.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:49.800]  Pure evil.
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.800]  It's pure evil.
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.800]  It's absolutely pure evil.
[02:04:51.800 --> 02:04:53.800]  It's hard to unionize as some moral people,
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:55.800]  I guess you can say, to comprehend
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.800]  that people could be this evil, but they are.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.800]  They're here.
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:01.800]  And why else would John Glenn, who's also an evil man, by the way,
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:04.800]  introduce a bill to protect human research subjects?
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.800]  I don't like being a human research subject.
[02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.800]  I am a man.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:09.800]  I'm not an animal.
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:10.800]  And I don't like it.
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:11.800]  I'm not going to tolerate it.
[02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:15.800]  My gosh, I just haven't had a driver's license since 1998
[02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:17.800]  because I won't take a biometric scan
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:19.800]  and put on computers to be traced off the world.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:22.800]  I've been fighting this with the DMV in the state for years.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:24.800]  We made a few inroads in the last few months.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:28.800]  In my teaching, which is always on our website, pastorbutch.com,
[02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:30.800]  Rendering Under Caesar Explains is on there.
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.800]  They can watch it for free.
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:34.800]  Rendering Under Caesar Explains is a 3-hour video.
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:37.800]  Watch it all on pastorbutch.com.
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:38.800]  Folks, please watch that.
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:40.800]  It can save your soul from hell.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:42.800]  Let me talk about denial here.
[02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:47.800]  We have video of Dick Cheney saying that he was the head of the CFR,
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:50.800]  the director, and that he didn't tell his constituents
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:51.800]  when David Rockefeller was laughing.
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:54.800]  And then I get emails saying it's not real video.
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:55.800]  It isn't true.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:57.800]  I mean, these people are delusional.
[02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:01.800]  1994, 1995, some of the CFR, trial and error commission,
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.800]  all the rest of it, and they didn't exist.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:04.800]  No one's ever heard of them.
[02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:05.800]  They're not real.
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:09.800]  Now they're out on TV saying, yes, remember CFR.
[02:06:09.800 --> 02:06:10.800]  As you said, Cheney said it.
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:12.800]  That people still are in denial, Alex.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:17.800]  They just cannot grasp the idea that we have become this evil
[02:06:17.800 --> 02:06:19.800]  and so far down the road in the tyranny.
[02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.800]  And I hope people will watch.
[02:06:21.800 --> 02:06:22.800]  We're in a seizure.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:23.800]  It's free.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.800]  I'm not trying to sell it.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:26.800]  And right above it's another teaching entitled,
[02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:28.800]  Are We Humanist?
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.800]  You want to know how we got where we are in this country today?
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:33.800]  Watch through our teaching of humanism.
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.800]  Yeah, once you get rid of God's standards,
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:37.800]  it's man's standards, and that's in the toilet.
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:38.800]  There's nothing left.
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:43.800]  After that, there is nothing left except total destruction of a society.
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:47.800]  And I almost say this as a pastor and a preacher, which I am, by the way.
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:52.800]  If we as Christians, the church, do not judge the evil in society,
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:56.800]  then a righteous God will judge the whole nation and us along with it.
[02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:58.800]  And that's the way it is.
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:02.800]  Continuing with your research, and again, they tell the parents,
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:03.800]  oh, it's a program for your kids' safety.
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.800]  Sign this form, and really you're signing them into this whole program.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.800]  Oh, yes.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.800]  And they finally made it.
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:15.800]  In Clarksburg, West Virginia, we have the headquarters for all the biometric
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:17.800]  information of this whole nation.
[02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:21.800]  Yeah, I remember seeing that six years ago that the biometric database was to be there.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.800]  Yes, and it's operating course.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:25.800]  There's three stories on the ground.
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:29.800]  As a matter of fact, I talked to an engineer that helped develop that complex up there.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:32.800]  When I mentioned this on the ground, he was shocked that I knew that.
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:34.800]  He said, yeah, how did you know that?
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:40.800]  I remember back in, like, 99 hearing that they were going to build a national base there,
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:43.800]  a command base, to store all the national ID card info.
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:45.800]  Yes, ladies, it's already here and operating.
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:50.800]  But now they want me to find out that the information from my children go right into this database.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.800]  This is not for the protection of anybody.
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:57.800]  This is for data up on every human being in this nation and eventually around the world.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:07:59.800]  And now they're even trying to get tissue samples at the schools,
[02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:04.800]  and that way, if David Rockefeller needs an organ, your child's going to get snatched, folks.
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:05.800]  Oh, my, yes.
[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.800]  This is all in this material I've got in front of me, and I'm going to be, it's going to take a while.
[02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.800]  I've only got about 30 pages, and I told you not to fax me the whole thousand.
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:15.800]  But I do know from the other stuff, they do tissue type.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:18.800]  Take China, where they're taking national DNA databases,
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:21.800]  and they come charge you with a crime when some elitist needs it,
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:23.800]  and needs your organs, and needs your goods.
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:25.800]  Tell us about that part, then.
[02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:28.800]  Well, this is a database.
[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:30.800]  Again, they're not admitting they're going to do this,
[02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:32.800]  but they are taking, of course, DNA and other tissues.
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:36.800]  But it's run by the West Virginia Institution Review Board
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:38.800]  of the Protection of Human Research Subjects.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:41.800]  That's from the West Virginia University Institute
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:43.800]  for the Protection of Human Research Subjects, yes.
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:47.800]  And this, I read, I discussed in a Bible studies over two years ago.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:50.800]  And you know why so much of this happens in Texas and Arkansas and West Virginia,
[02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:52.800]  because they think we're a bunch of dumb hillbillies.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:54.800]  Well, joy kind of proved that.
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:09:01.800]  But as I read this, I become angry, I become frustrated,
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:05.800]  and I become very agitated because I see this happening,
[02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:08.800]  and the masses, again, are in denial.
[02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:11.800]  Thank God some people are now seeing that 911 was an inside job.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:15.800]  As you mentioned, the actor is on the view,
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:18.800]  and they watched the view, but you mentioned his name this morning,
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:20.800]  and we exposed this.
[02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:22.800]  Some people are getting their eyes open to some truth.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:26.800]  Again, either the other side must move with a great thrust
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:30.800]  to put us back into the cage, or we're going to break out
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:31.800]  and break this thing down.
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:32.800]  One or the other.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.800]  There can't be anything between ground here.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.800]  And that's one of the biggest problems is,
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:36.800]  when Hitler was doing what he was doing,
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:39.800]  the churches said lay down, he's the Antichrist, don't fight.
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:42.800]  Whenever Nero was doing something, they said lay down, he's the Antichrist.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:44.800]  No, that's a lie.
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:47.800]  They told the founding fathers lay down, the British or the devil.
[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:49.800]  No, you're to fight evil regardless.
[02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:53.800]  If we do not fight evil, we are partakers of that evil
[02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.800]  and also consenting to that evil.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:58.800]  And that absolutely is something that Christians must learn.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:02.800]  I've gotten a lot of flack over the years because I preach this and teach this.
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:04.800]  We are put here on earth not to save souls.
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:06.800]  Now, that's going to make a lot of people just going to shock them.
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:07.800]  You're not fighting.
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:09.800]  We're in the Bible where the church said to save souls.
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:11.800]  We're here, according to Matthew 28, in a great commission,
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:13.800]  to go out and disciple.
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:16.800]  That means discipline the nations, teaching the laws of the Almighty God.
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:19.800]  Because once you know the laws, they know that they need a savior.
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:21.800]  Until then, they don't know that they're even sinners.
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:23.800]  We're not here to save.
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:25.800]  We're here to discipline, to teach the laws of God,
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.800]  and see that his laws are the ones that are in power that are in authority.
[02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:32.800]  Well, I've found that if you show somebody how evil the New World Order is,
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.800]  they get religion real fast.
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:37.800]  Absolutely. That's the whole job of the church.
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:39.800]  Most pastors won't touch what I do.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:41.800]  They're scared to death of this.
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.800]  I've wasted a lot of time.
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:47.800]  Here's an example. People tell their kids not to smoke
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:49.800]  because they're not old enough and it's too much fun.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:51.800]  Then they go out and smoke.
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:54.800]  If you explain to your children that it's there to destroy them,
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:57.800]  that the government's against them, that the system is there to trap them,
[02:10:57.800 --> 02:10:59.800]  they will then listen to you.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:01.800]  Oh, absolutely. Again, that's a pastor's job.
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:03.800]  We have very few real pastors in America today, Alex.
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:05.800]  We have a lot of pulpit pimps,
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:07.800]  paying the waste of pulpit prostitutes
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:09.800]  that are paid against salary to keep them out shut
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:11.800]  in their taxiderm status by one of the three churches.
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:13.800]  We're not speaking out there.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:15.800]  They're cowards there. They're moral corrupt cowards.
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:17.800]  Pat Robertson was one of them.
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:19.800]  We go on from being here all bunch of them.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:21.800]  Stay there. We've got to break and come back.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:23.800]  Final segment. I want to plug your numbers, your ministry.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:25.800]  Let folks know how to listen to you tonight
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:27.800]  from 8 to 9 central.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.800]  We will recap all this,
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:31.800]  and I'll talk a little bit about 9-11
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:33.800]  and the top stories.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:35.800]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:59.800]  Let's go to the website.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:07.800]  Just a little southeast of Nome.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:11.800]  He talked to his team of huskies
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:13.800]  as he marched on through the snow
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.800]  with the northern lights running wild
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.800]  in the land of the midnight sun.
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:29.800]  Your Santa Claus was a body man in the year of 1901.
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:31.800]  Do you think it's convincing
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:35.800]  what they tell in the film?
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:39.800]  It's not so much what they say.
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.800]  It's the things that, you know,
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:47.800]  make you look at what you thought you saw
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:49.800]  in a different light.
[02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:53.800]  And those things, for me,
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:55.800]  that bother me
[02:12:55.800 --> 02:12:59.800]  is the hole in the Pentagon being too small for a plane.
[02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:01.800]  The lawn isn't messed up,
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:03.800]  and the government's not showing the plane hitting
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:07.800]  when many cameras photographed it.
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:09.800]  At the World Trade Center,
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.800]  three buildings came down like demolition,
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:16.800]  and two of them were hit by a plane,
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.800]  and the third one, they said,
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:20.800]  do you want us to pull it?
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:23.800]  And they pulled it, and it looked just like the other two.
[02:13:23.800 --> 02:13:25.800]  Those things bother me.
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:28.800]  In Pennsylvania, the plane that went down,
[02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.800]  it was just a...
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:32.800]  Confirming, but it looks like it's accurate
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:35.800]  that James Brolin, huge himself,
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:37.800]  also put out a 9-11 truth site this morning
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:40.800]  when he was hosting a view on national television.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.800]  But it's exciting!
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:44.800]  Yes, it is, sir. I'm glad we're in the battle.
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.800]  I know for a fact that we were not born in our time-basting.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:49.800]  Our creator had us here for a purpose.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:51.800]  I think we're feeling his purpose.
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:53.800]  I intend to fight this battle until I die.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:55.800]  I'll tell you, the old devil fights dirty, though,
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.800]  with all this mind control and propaganda.
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:59.800]  It's unbelievable.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.800]  The only protection we have,
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:03.800]  and is the Holy Spirit in us,
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:05.800]  if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't survive five minutes.
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.800]  As Nick Begic said in his book,
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:09.800]  the mind has no firewalls.
[02:14:09.800 --> 02:14:11.800]  The only firewall we have around us is the protection of a holy God.
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:13.800]  And that's where I stand.
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.800]  I know I'm not going out of this world until my time is up,
[02:14:15.800 --> 02:14:17.800]  and I'm going to battle until I do leave this world.
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:19.800]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:20.800]  It is unbelievable.
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:22.800]  Give out your phone number and show them.
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:23.800]  Sure.
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:25.800]  People can contact us to call to the station
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:29.800]  at 800-777-4403.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:32.800]  That's 800-777-4403.
[02:14:32.800 --> 02:14:34.800]  Website pastrabuch.com.
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:37.800]  They list a program at 9 o'clock p.m. eastern
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:40.800]  every night on pastrabuch.com, GCNLive.com.
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:42.800]  They scroll down by the page there
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:44.800]  and find out what stations we're on,
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:45.800]  at least the ones I know of.
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:48.800]  We're on 3.215 shortwave, 9 o'clock p.m. every night,
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:50.800]  3.215 shortwave.
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:53.800]  And again, we're here to help people with anything they need
[02:14:53.800 --> 02:14:56.800]  if they just call 800-777-4403.
[02:14:56.800 --> 02:14:58.800]  We offer our news magazine once a month.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:00.800]  We don't charge for extra donations.
[02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:01.800]  It's huge.
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.800]  It's full of information I can share with you today.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:05.800]  We're out of time, but I want to tell you,
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:07.800]  I love your spirit and I love you
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:09.800]  and your great wife and everybody.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:11.800]  It was good having you on with us today.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:13.800]  We'll get it numbered out quickly because you said it so fast.
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:17.800]  It's at the phone number 800-777-4403
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.800]  at your butch.com.
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:21.800]  We're out of time. Salute should keep it up.
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:23.800]  Will you write some report up on this for us?
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  I certainly will.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:26.800]  If you write it, we'll publish it
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:28.800]  and get it out to people about this.
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:29.800]  Just one more thing.
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:31.800]  There's so much evil I can't even cover it all anymore, folks.
[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:33.800]  I'm just wallowing in it.
[02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:35.800]  There's so many victories we're having
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:37.800]  and so many stories I want to break.
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:38.800]  We're just on fire.
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.800]  We'll see you back tonight at 9 o'clock p.m.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:41.800]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:43.800]  Get out there and take on the new old order.
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:16:12.800]  God bless you all.
