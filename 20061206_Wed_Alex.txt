[00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:08.054]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:09.835]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:11.596]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:13.176]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:14.737]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:18.939]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:28.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:29.225]  Welcome.
[00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:30.525]  It is December 6, 2006.
[00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:39.734]  We will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:58.162]  We have Dr. Nick Begich joining us to talk about all of the declassified and patented admissions of mind control and ongoing mind control operations, both passive and captive, here in the United States and worldwide.
[00:00:58.162 --> 00:01:01.083]  And then Pastor Butch Paul joins us coming up.
[00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:08.217]  To talk about a report that came out of their mainstream news and they got some documents associated with it.
[00:01:08.217 --> 00:01:11.138]  How they're retina scanning and thumb scanning school children.
[00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.599]  I have about 30 pages of documents here.
[00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:14.739]  He has over a thousand.
[00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:15.960]  He couldn't fax them all to me.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.800]  He was offering to.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.400]  I said, no, don't worry about it.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.461]  But I've got the 30 pages.
[00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.282]  I'm trying to read over them right now.
[00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:26.023]  And guess who's running the program to biometrically scan your children in?
[00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:28.124]  Ah, yes.
[00:01:28.124 --> 00:01:34.330]  A government department that deals with human experimentation and testing.
[00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.892]  Same folks that brought you eugenics.
[00:01:36.892 --> 00:01:40.155]  So it all ties together with both guests today.
[00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:47.142]  We'll also have open phones in this first hour and with both of our guests today.
[00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:51.446]  Flatulence, not turbulence, forces plane landing in Nashville.
[00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:52.567]  This is out of a Tennessean.
[00:01:53.695 --> 00:02:00.521]  Flatulence brought 99 passengers on an American Airlines flight to an unscheduled visit to Nashville early Monday morning.
[00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.522]  We're now learning the details.
[00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.945]  The woman was in the bathroom and did what old folks do.
[00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:17.815]  They like to be friendly and strike a match so the next person doesn't have to smell the methane gases that are produced in the intestines.
[00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:20.978]  Lower and, well, they're in the large and small intestine.
[00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:25.557]  And, uh, they landed the plane and they're considering charging her.
[00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:26.978]  They're not charging her at this time.
[00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:30.299]  You can have matches, but striking them is illegal.
[00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.320]  And so everyone panicked.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:39.284]  And, of course, uh, they found out that she wasn't Al-Cieda about to attack.
[00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:40.885]  And that dovetails with this report.
[00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:44.367]  Police told me my cricket ball was a potentially lethal weapon.
[00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:46.529]  A middle-class businessman.
[00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:48.930]  No criminal record in his suit.
[00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:57.267]  He was leaving work, going to cricket practice with a ball in his hand because he said he was practicing throwing and spinning.
[00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:02.490]  I don't really know the game of cricket, but he was practicing with it in his hand.
[00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.413]  That's why he had it, and he was walking up the escalator to the tube station with the ball in his hand.
[00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:09.415]  He got ticketed and interrogated.
[00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:12.476]  This is the new world order.
[00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.198]  Everything is a crime.
[00:03:14.198 --> 00:03:16.259]  All of us are treated like five-year-old children.
[00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:44.157]  All of us are prodded and poked by low-IQ, low-grade morons that have shined up so they can engage in their control freak fantasies for the larger government, whose open plan is to set up a worldwide police state, one-child policies, forced psychological testing, drugging, total destruction of the nation-state, and all these idiots that push world government, the low-level minions who, well, I'm a citizen of the world, it's trendy, Miss America says she is!
[00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:47.854]  You're a man without a country, then.
[00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:53.759]  You're a woman without a country, because this New World Order is about taking your Bill of Rights, taking your national sovereignty.
[00:03:53.759 --> 00:04:03.166]  It's about making you being basically a chattel, Flotsam and Jetsam being born on the global tides of the New World Order.
[00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:04.807]  But you can't do that.
[00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:05.788]  It's just trendy!
[00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:09.311]  See how far it gets you!
[00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:10.672]  Yes.
[00:04:10.672 --> 00:04:15.716]  That trendiness won't put food on your table, or as Bush says, food on your family.
[00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:17.915]  But again, you're trendy.
[00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.896]  You've got it all figured out.
[00:04:20.896 --> 00:04:21.956]  So we'll get into that report.
[00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:25.937]  Also, huge article out by Paul Watson dealing with our interview yesterday.
[00:04:25.937 --> 00:04:30.118]  Ex-agent CIA seed money helped launch Google.
[00:04:30.118 --> 00:04:40.400]  And he fingered the head point man for the Google CIA operation.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.080]  So that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.101]  We'll be recapping that in case you missed the interview yesterday.
[00:04:46.898 --> 00:04:58.822]  Uh, the Iraq Study Group has not just published its preliminary findings, as it did two weeks ago, now the complete report has been issued, and surprise, surprise, it recommends absolute escalation of the war!
[00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:04.643]  I was a highway man, along the coach roads I did ride,
[00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:35.985]  With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:05:37.748 --> 00:05:44.410]  But I am still alive.
[00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.450]  I was a sailor.
[00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.431]  I was born upon the tide.
[00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:56.033]  With the sea I did abide.
[00:05:56.033 --> 00:06:02.094]  I sailed a schooner around the whole of New Mexico.
[00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:05.435]  I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow.
[00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.473]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:20.137]  But I'm living still.
[00:06:20.137 --> 00:06:26.920]  I was a dam building, across the river deep and wide.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.003]  Where steel and water didn't collide.
[00:06:32.003 --> 00:06:35.265]  A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:43.022]  Ladies and gentlemen, glad that you have tuned in.
[00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:45.884]  We're now 9 minutes, 58 seconds into this first hour.
[00:06:45.884 --> 00:06:51.028]  Two big guests coming up for you today, Pastor Butch Paw,
[00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:16.489]  Talk about the human experimentation program of the federal government involved in the biometric scanning and retina scanning of your children.
[00:07:17.327 --> 00:07:20.509]  I mean, we have the documents and dovetails with it.
[00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:29.273]  Our first guest in the second hour will be Dr. Nick Begich on his new Mind Control book and his new Mind Control video, all off of open source documentation.
[00:07:29.273 --> 00:07:37.437]  This is all admitted, and there's massive Mind Control programs going on at multiple levels publicly against us right now.
[00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:39.938]  That is not hidden.
[00:07:39.938 --> 00:07:41.178]  Much of it is not hidden.
[00:07:41.178 --> 00:07:44.120]  It is hidden in plain view, as they say.
[00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:53.635]  But right now, let's get into the war here in the great adventure of fighting the globalists.
[00:07:53.635 --> 00:08:08.425]  Now, if you really listen to what Democrats had to say, and then kind of the bridge between the two parties, the two mafias that work for the larger mafia bosses globally above them, it's basically what McCain has been saying.
[00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:11.948]  We have to build up for a build down.
[00:08:12.751 --> 00:08:16.453]  And that's actually the Pentagon public strategy.
[00:08:16.453 --> 00:08:19.855]  That is their propaganda for two and a half plus years.
[00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:21.917]  They've been saying, oh, we'll be out in a few years.
[00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:28.941]  We just have to increase troops and train the Iraqi brigades before we can leave.
[00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:35.105]  And so now they know that you're on to their fraud, on to their lie, and so you're demanding the troops be removed.
[00:08:35.105 --> 00:08:35.585]  And they're saying,
[00:08:36.326 --> 00:08:38.047]  Okay, well, we failed.
[00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:39.447]  We're losing the war.
[00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:39.947]  You're right.
[00:08:39.947 --> 00:08:41.348]  We're listening to you.
[00:08:41.348 --> 00:08:43.388]  We're doing what you've asked.
[00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:51.911]  We're going to put it into a process now, an independent process, with James Baker and Robert Gates and Bush Sr.
[00:08:51.911 --> 00:09:01.434]  and everybody else, and they're going to come in and publicly spank Georgie Boy and Georgie Porgie Pudding Pie, and boy, we've listened to you.
[00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:05.275]  And it's the same process they've been pushing for two and a half years.
[00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:15.966]  Again, they just have a big debate and say, boy, we heard what you said, and the Iraq Study Group's recommendation is to pull the troops out.
[00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:22.010]  And then they go on to say, it's kind of like a contract, you know, where there's the big print at the top, and then you read the little bitty print.
[00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.033]  You can get out your huge magnifying glass, and it says the opposite.
[00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:29.396]  But the big print says, we're going to pull the troops out.
[00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:31.637]  And Bush to make it look like it has validity.
[00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.878]  I mean, it's theater, folks.
[00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:33.619]  They play a theater.
[00:09:34.813 --> 00:09:37.555]  I don't like this recommendation.
[00:09:37.555 --> 00:09:40.617]  It doesn't need to keep troops.
[00:09:40.617 --> 00:09:45.239]  I'm a little angry about this.
[00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:47.361]  You see how this works?
[00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:48.521]  What does it actually say?
[00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.243]  We're going to pull the troops out after we put 20,000 to 30,000 more in.
[00:09:53.904 --> 00:10:14.950]  And train the 18 groups of Iraqi National Guard, and they've only effectively trained two, and they never intend to train them, and they're building permanent bases in the actual Pentagon documents that if you want to go dig them up are available, say we will be there in 20 plus years with a contingent built down, when they're finally done, of about 30,000 U.S.
[00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:20.152]  troops garrisoned in armored compounds running the genocide operations.
[00:10:20.732 --> 00:10:34.038]  And in 20 years at current extermination rates, so it's 600 plus thousand in three and a half years, you will see only about half of the Iraqi population left that's currently there.
[00:10:34.038 --> 00:10:40.041]  The extermination operations killed 2.15 million conservatively in the last 16 years.
[00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.021]  Now they've stepped up the extermination.
[00:10:44.136 --> 00:10:45.397]  But it'll be a minor footnote.
[00:10:45.397 --> 00:10:56.321]  I mean, it may end up where, you know, some SWORD robotic armored unit, which they already have in place, is tracking down the last Iraqi who's shot in the back and falls down bleeding.
[00:10:56.321 --> 00:11:00.042]  And there'll be a big, Battle Command victory in America!
[00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:05.384]  Homeland Base scores another hit against the Islamo-fascist threat.
[00:11:05.384 --> 00:11:12.767]  And big, huge, pot-bellied New World Order minions will sit in their houses looking at huge plasma screen, you know, drinking beer and eating pizza.
[00:11:13.587 --> 00:11:19.170]  Feeling physically powerful, as if, you know, by the extermination they've gotten some type of great victory.
[00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.312]  I mean, that's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[00:11:22.312 --> 00:11:27.534]  And, of course, I'm trying to lead it to its absurd extreme, but, I mean, 2.15 mil down!
[00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:27.694]  2.15 mil!
[00:11:27.694 --> 00:11:29.255]  I mean, just the 1.5, 150,000's quite a piece of change!
[00:11:38.658 --> 00:11:46.205]  Yeah, but 2,150,000 dead and counting.
[00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.327]  Great job, New World Order.
[00:11:48.327 --> 00:11:50.469]  Total precision.
[00:11:50.469 --> 00:11:51.950]  But no, they haven't failed.
[00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.412]  They haven't screwed up an IRAC.
[00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:59.307]  There's a little concern by the Pentagon that they've overcooked the cake, as I say.
[00:11:59.307 --> 00:12:00.668]  They meant to break it in three parts.
[00:12:00.668 --> 00:12:03.510]  They meant to have sectarian and religious war and strife.
[00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:08.233]  That's the strategy of tension and balkanization, divide and conquer for the entire region.
[00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:12.676]  Pentagon document 2002, Israeli original plan 1983.
[00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:16.138]  It's been in major Israeli papers.
[00:12:16.138 --> 00:12:23.043]  There is a concern that they wanted to bake the cake, and that's balkanization, mass murder, extermination, but it's a little... it's overcooking it
[00:12:24.213 --> 00:12:26.594]  And breaking down even faster than they wanted.
[00:12:26.594 --> 00:12:30.936]  It's a little embarrassing to have, you know, hundreds of thousands being killed a year.
[00:12:30.936 --> 00:12:45.082]  So they want to get it off the front pages and put it into some type of procedural debate and depoliticize it where the Democrats were all hating the war, mainly just to hate Bush, because they didn't hate it when Clinton was doing the same thing.
[00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:51.878]  In fact, almost a million of that 2.15 million died under his 8-year watch.
[00:12:51.878 --> 00:12:53.500]  Remember Madeleine Albright?
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.264]  They said, 700 plus thousand dead Iraqis, 500,000 of them children.
[00:12:58.264 --> 00:13:00.406]  Is that a good price to pay for stability?
[00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:02.388]  And she said on NBC, she said, yes.
[00:13:02.388 --> 00:13:04.530]  We ought to find that clip.
[00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.615]  We've got a YouTube, Madeleine Albright, good price to pay, dead Iraqis, good price to pay.
[00:13:09.615 --> 00:13:11.737]  It should pop up so folks can hear that again.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.861]  I've got it somewhere here in the office.
[00:13:13.861 --> 00:13:15.062]  I was having trouble finding it.
[00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:16.483]  I was trying to find it the other day and couldn't.
[00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:17.664]  Do you have it out there, listeners?
[00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.145]  Would you mail us a copy if you do?
[00:13:19.145 --> 00:13:21.006]  I bet one of you does right now.
[00:13:21.006 --> 00:13:25.509]  Thanks to all the listeners that do honor our request and dig out that stuff and send it to us.
[00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:28.511]  So, you know, they don't even joke about it.
[00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:31.373]  I mean, they just openly admit it.
[00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:32.474]  They make no bones.
[00:13:32.474 --> 00:13:34.075]  It's a good price to pay, you know.
[00:13:34.075 --> 00:13:35.656]  Half a mil, kids, you know.
[00:13:35.656 --> 00:13:37.658]  That was in 97.
[00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:41.100]  Here we are, what, six, seven, eight years later, and the enjoyment
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.022]  Has only intensified.
[00:13:45.022 --> 00:13:52.386]  So, on the heels of that, it's not enough to have the, quote, independent group, the Iraq Study Group, appointed by Bush.
[00:13:52.386 --> 00:13:53.627]  It's very independent.
[00:13:53.627 --> 00:14:04.494]  Now we have to have the Democrats line up, from Hillary, to Schumer, to Lieberman, to Representative Sylvester Reyes.
[00:14:04.494 --> 00:14:07.495]  Leading Democrat wants more troops in Iraq.
[00:14:07.495 --> 00:14:08.316]  This is Newsweek.
[00:14:09.602 --> 00:14:10.802]  In a surprise!
[00:14:10.802 --> 00:14:14.503]  Oh, it's so surprising!
[00:14:14.503 --> 00:14:20.145]  There'll be no investigations, no abolishing Patriot Act, no abolishing Military Commissions Act.
[00:14:20.145 --> 00:14:34.529]  And when Hillary gets in, or another Democrat, the very Democrats you know that hate Bush and are against the Military Commissions Act, will turn to you and say that either the powers don't exist now, or that they need them to fight the militias.
[00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:35.889]  Oh, it's going to be bad.
[00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:48.907]  That's why we need to break their conditioning now, those that are listening, before you go under the mass mind control of the coffee and tea parties you have with your other cyborg liberal friends.
[00:14:48.907 --> 00:14:54.829]  You're a den of un-American scum if you go along with wars.
[00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:59.792]  I was against the war when they attacked Serbia.
[00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:00.952]  And I was against the sanctions.
[00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:09.895]  I'll be the same today and tomorrow, and I was the same a month ago, as I was five years ago, because I know the new war plan.
[00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:11.075]  It's just common sense.
[00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:13.037]  So I'm begging Democrats out there.
[00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.498]  I'm begging you.
[00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:16.119]  Please.
[00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:17.900]  They're passing the torch now.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.162]  They're passing the baton to the Democrats.
[00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:22.463]  They're going to intensify the agenda.
[00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.264]  Please stay awake.
[00:15:24.264 --> 00:15:25.005]  Please.
[00:15:26.448 --> 00:15:34.650]  Please don't let them neutralize you doing this, as the Republicans were neutralized in fighting the Globalists when Bush was put in.
[00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.831]  Just the double team continues.
[00:15:37.831 --> 00:15:46.154]  Leading Democrat wants more troops in Iraq, in a surprise twist in the debate over Iraq, Representative Sylvester Reyes,
[00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:55.625]  Suckering Succotash, soon to be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said he wants to see an increase of 20,000 or 30,000 troops.
[00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:58.867]  Again, he just parrots what McCain and Bush say.
[00:15:58.867 --> 00:15:59.028]  U.S.
[00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:08.276]  troops as part of a stepped-up effort to dismantle the militias, when all of the internal CIA reports have now been made public, say that our presence makes it worse.
[00:16:08.276 --> 00:16:09.497]  Well, of course!
[00:16:09.497 --> 00:16:14.001]  Add some fuel to that fire, throw a big ol' yule log on there, which is our troops.
[00:16:15.265 --> 00:16:27.249]  The soft-spoken Texas Democrat was an early opponent of the Iraq War and voted against October 2002 resolution authorizing President Bush to invade that country.
[00:16:27.249 --> 00:16:36.071]  And it says that dovish record got prominently cited last week when Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi chose Reyes as the new head of the intelligence panel.
[00:16:36.071 --> 00:16:38.912]  But in an interview with Newsweek on Tuesday, Reyes
[00:16:40.985 --> 00:16:47.567]  Potently distancing himself from many of the Democratic colleagues who have called for fixed timetables and withdrawal of U.S.
[00:16:47.567 --> 00:16:48.888]  troops.
[00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:52.469]  You took your 30 pieces of silver, didn't you?
[00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:54.629]  Yeah, now all that blood's on your hands.
[00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:57.350]  You're now a murderer too, Reyes.
[00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:58.130]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:05.572 --> 00:17:28.122]  The union's our big business plan And it's going down like a dinosaur Well, they used to grow food in Kansas And they want to grow it on the moon in Iraq I can see the day coming when even your home country's gonna be in Iraq
[00:17:34.577 --> 00:17:36.839]  Sundown on the Union!
[00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:38.461]  And what was made in the USA.
[00:17:38.461 --> 00:17:41.904]  Alright, massive development.
[00:17:41.904 --> 00:17:45.368]  A massive development for 9-11 Truth.
[00:17:45.368 --> 00:17:47.670]  Just took place.
[00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:55.197]  My thanks to the loose change commandos who called our office to let us know about this and just sent us the video clip.
[00:17:55.197 --> 00:17:58.881]  We are, with comments, going to be uploading it to the web in the next hour.
[00:17:59.942 --> 00:18:05.406]  You will be able to see it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:09.529]  We're getting an emergency report out on this right now.
[00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:17.735]  David Lynch, who is a huge director in Hollywood and television.
[00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:21.117]  I mean, we tried to list all the films and movies he's made.
[00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:34.399]  I'm sure you know about Twin Peaks, the TV shows, Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, Wild at Heart, Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire.
[00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:36.081]  Unbelievable!
[00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:38.383]  He has gone public on 9-11.
[00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:49.692]  I mean, this is great news, because it will just get more people who are on the fence that know it's an inside job to speak out.
[00:18:50.265 --> 00:18:58.067]  And he was interviewed, I guess they kept it quiet for Dutch TV, and the Loose Change boys didn't know about it until they were just sent the clip.
[00:18:58.067 --> 00:19:02.968]  They were interviewed for it and they played it, I guess, part of Loose Change on Dutch television.
[00:19:02.968 --> 00:19:07.609]  I bet Queen Beatrix really loved that!
[00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:11.030]  And I just, look, it's like a major touchdown getting scored here, okay?
[00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.370]  I'd spike the ball right now.
[00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.451]  I just, this is, this is fabulous.
[00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:16.711]  Because I know so many
[00:19:17.472 --> 00:19:18.393]  I don't know so many.
[00:19:18.393 --> 00:19:22.517]  I guess, I know probably 30 or 40 Hollywood people.
[00:19:22.517 --> 00:19:23.698]  Some of them huge.
[00:19:23.698 --> 00:19:24.058]  Huge.
[00:19:24.058 --> 00:19:25.359]  As big as they get.
[00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:28.162]  And they all know about 9-11.
[00:19:28.162 --> 00:19:30.844]  And then they all tell me everybody they know about 9-11.
[00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:35.188]  So that's how I come to the statement on CNN that, you know, hundreds are awake.
[00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:38.991]  Because, you know, I'll be talking to some famous person and they go, and I go, how many people know?
[00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:40.032]  Oh, we all know.
[00:19:40.032 --> 00:19:41.273]  He knows, she knows.
[00:19:41.273 --> 00:19:41.533]  Oh, really?
[00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:42.514]  You have discussions?
[00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:43.335]  Oh, yeah, you know.
[00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:47.311]  It's amazing!
[00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:51.635]  Only Charlie Sheen, though, had the courage to hit that barbed wire first.
[00:19:51.635 --> 00:19:53.156]  I mean, Dean Haglund had the courage.
[00:19:53.156 --> 00:19:56.359]  He's been in a lot of big TV shows and in some movies.
[00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:01.464]  But, you know, he's not as big as, obviously, someone like Charlie Sheen.
[00:20:01.464 --> 00:20:02.484]  He's been eclipsed by him.
[00:20:06.665 --> 00:20:07.326]  I feel good.
[00:20:07.326 --> 00:20:08.607]  I'm having adrenaline.
[00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:09.968]  I'm having endorphin.
[00:20:09.968 --> 00:20:12.890]  My brain, see, I don't need to use drugs, folks.
[00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.473]  When you do the right thing, when you fight evil, you get rewarded.
[00:20:16.473 --> 00:20:22.858]  And just seeing this victory, seeing this happen, right now, I am just going to pause and enjoy this for a minute.
[00:20:22.858 --> 00:20:23.238]  Excuse me.
[00:20:23.238 --> 00:20:23.458]  Hold on.
[00:20:31.978 --> 00:20:32.599]  I'm sorry.
[00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:34.960]  I'm just not going to.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.881]  I enjoy this.
[00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:02.329]  I have to enjoy it.
[00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:06.211]  I deserve a little bit of victory occasionally, a little bit of a victory dance.
[00:21:06.211 --> 00:21:30.340]  You should all be having one right now because every person that steps forward, every big shot that goes public, and it's happening every few weeks now, is one inch closer, and we're only a foot or two away now, from slitting the New World Order's throat and surviving and living and being able to not work as hard, not fight the New World Order as hard, not be able to have a life.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.881]  I'm not worried about getting drug off to some FEMA camp.
[00:21:34.881 --> 00:21:46.865]  But anyways, he's a very quiet, pensive person, very reserved, but if you hear what he has to say, he's saying, look, it is what it is, and a lot of people think it is.
[00:21:46.865 --> 00:21:59.749]  So he went about 95% of the way, and it's an exciting clip, and I've never, I don't think I've ever done a five-minute segment where I'm just giddily, basically supine, basically on my back, figuratively in a
[00:22:01.684 --> 00:22:10.389]  Something akin to, uh, Rapture, but, uh, I do, I do enjoy seeing their House of Cards fall.
[00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:30.722]  It's like I'm watching a dam, and bigger and bigger chunks are busting out, and larger gouts of water is, uh, is spraying through the orifice as it gets larger, and, uh, frankly, I'm just up there with my little ball-peen hammer smacking away, and the more water sprays in my face, the happier I get.
[00:22:32.077 --> 00:22:39.080]  So you get all giddy and dance around when your football team scores, which means nothing to your children's future, nothing to this country, and you're normal.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:54.866]  I'm bad when I, uh, have a tribal victory dance on air for another great salvo, another capital ship of the new world order, listing and capsizing and sinking!
[00:22:54.866 --> 00:22:58.788]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:22:58.788 --> 00:23:01.509]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:23:06.069 --> 00:23:11.912]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:11.912 --> 00:23:15.374]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:23:15.374 --> 00:23:18.216]  You see, normally it only happens every few weeks or so.
[00:23:18.216 --> 00:23:22.479]  I get one of those euphoric rushes of victory, but it's usually when I'm off air.
[00:23:22.479 --> 00:23:25.300]  And I dance around, there's lots of back slapping.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:31.785]  But I just got word, heard part of the clip during the last break, came in with the news and just had to
[00:23:33.203 --> 00:23:33.744]  Share it with you.
[00:23:33.744 --> 00:23:35.586]  This is life and death.
[00:23:35.586 --> 00:23:44.677]  See, imagine how excited people get about a basketball or football game when there's a grand slam or a sudden death overtime, you know, last second on the clock, running it in.
[00:23:45.646 --> 00:23:47.787]  Imagine that euphoria that people have.
[00:23:47.787 --> 00:23:50.227]  You see, that's misplaced euphoria.
[00:23:50.227 --> 00:24:06.232]  That's because that tribal, symbolic, mock battle you're seeing, it has those feelings of euphoria for you, because it's a counterfeit of what you're really supposed to get excited about, and that's real warfare for your family, your tribe, your country.
[00:24:06.232 --> 00:24:07.312]  That's what we're talking about here.
[00:24:09.602 --> 00:24:13.223]  And the New World Order is taking our families from us, breaking down the family.
[00:24:13.223 --> 00:24:14.884]  They're taking our countries from us.
[00:24:14.884 --> 00:24:16.785]  They're taking our states from us.
[00:24:16.785 --> 00:24:21.327]  And then all we serve is the state, the all-powerful global state.
[00:24:21.327 --> 00:24:24.068]  And the state then knows that we want to make war.
[00:24:24.068 --> 00:24:25.308]  That's how we're designed.
[00:24:25.308 --> 00:24:32.411]  And so they make us make war with weak third world countries, which is really a war against the people that they're attacking and the slaves themselves.
[00:24:32.411 --> 00:24:32.851]  That's us.
[00:24:33.787 --> 00:24:41.092]  And then they wage war against us domestically by divide-and-conquer, playing us all off against each other.
[00:24:41.092 --> 00:24:42.433]  This is how they operate.
[00:24:42.433 --> 00:24:44.395]  This is their program.
[00:24:44.395 --> 00:24:50.880]  Alright, here's David Lynch of the Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Eraserhead.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:58.585]  I mean, we're talking hundreds of credits, over 50 major films, TV.
[00:24:58.585 --> 00:25:02.468]  I mean, I can't go over all of it here.
[00:25:03.209 --> 00:25:09.993]  And here he is talking about 9-11 and saying, yeah, well, a lot of people think it is, you know, the buildings fell like that.
[00:25:09.993 --> 00:25:11.454]  They said they pulled it.
[00:25:11.454 --> 00:25:19.700]  I mean, this is really strong word for somebody I've seen interviewed who is very introspective, you could say.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.061]  Here it is.
[00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:22.502]  What do you think?
[00:25:22.502 --> 00:25:26.844]  Do you think it's convincing, what they tell in the film?
[00:25:26.844 --> 00:25:30.787]  It's not so much what they say,
[00:25:31.927 --> 00:25:41.932]  Um, it's the things that, you know, um, make you look at what you thought you saw in a different light.
[00:25:41.932 --> 00:25:58.520]  And those things for me, um, that bother me, um, is the hole in the Pentagon being too small for a plane, the lawn isn't messed up, and the government's not showing the plane hitting when many cameras photographed it.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.621]  At the World Trade Center,
[00:26:00.572 --> 00:26:12.074]  Three buildings came down like demolition, and two of them were hit by a plane, but the third one, they said, do you want us to pull it?
[00:26:12.074 --> 00:26:15.275]  And they pulled it, and it looked just like the other two.
[00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:17.335]  Those things bother me.
[00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:22.076]  In Pennsylvania, the plane that went down, it was just a hole in the ground.
[00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:30.278]  There wasn't any wreckage, there wasn't any skid marks, there wasn't any tear in the earth, and no one's ever really
[00:26:30.854 --> 00:26:52.573]  found out about that so every place there's questions coming from this documentary and you don't have to believe everything in the documentary to still have questions come up and you look back and you remember what you saw and what you were told and now you have questions
[00:26:53.723 --> 00:26:58.165]  And the event itself, did it change your life?
[00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:00.326]  Or did it change your view?
[00:27:00.326 --> 00:27:00.747]  No.
[00:27:00.747 --> 00:27:08.751]  Now it's just an event that has many questions and no answers.
[00:27:08.751 --> 00:27:13.353]  And the suggestion that the American government is behind it?
[00:27:13.353 --> 00:27:17.295]  It's too big for people to think about.
[00:27:17.295 --> 00:27:20.496]  It's too big.
[00:27:20.496 --> 00:27:22.437]  What do you mean?
[00:27:22.437 --> 00:27:23.358]  It's just, you know...
[00:27:24.668 --> 00:27:27.050]  It's like something no one wants to think about.
[00:27:46.156 --> 00:27:52.879]  We'll be posting the video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com.
[00:27:52.879 --> 00:27:58.581]  Aaron's doing it right now, so the first place you'll see it will be at JonesReport.com.
[00:27:58.581 --> 00:28:08.125]  I don't make Aaron work 18 hours a day, but he likes to four or five days a week, so that's why so many times, if you want to see the latest breaking news, JonesReport.com.
[00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:16.454]  I mean, that's where you'll see a lot of things I'm here at the office working on first, because he's always there.
[00:28:16.454 --> 00:28:27.463]  Lord Slickheysen, it's a joke around here, I shouldn't joke around, we all tease each other because, you know, they call each other British Lords and all that over in England, the New World Order does, so we joke around and do that.
[00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:33.968]  Ryan Slickheysen works on Infowars off and on, I'd say about 10-12 hours a day.
[00:28:33.968 --> 00:28:37.611]  Sometimes he updates late at night, sometimes in the morning, he updates multiple times daily.
[00:28:37.611 --> 00:28:39.192]  The Watsons update like a newspaper.
[00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:50.243]  ...newspaper at about nine o'clock central in the morning and at six o'clock to six thirty central at night.
[00:28:50.243 --> 00:28:54.524]  Of course breaking news as it develops.
[00:28:54.524 --> 00:29:05.486]  Infowars.net is updated once a day but it is always has original reportage by Steve Watson and then other little, his little signature of news that he thinks is important.
[00:29:05.486 --> 00:29:06.927]  So that's why we have so many sites.
[00:29:06.927 --> 00:29:11.788]  The real reason we developed so many sites is because we had so many denial of service attacks, hack attacks,
[00:29:12.822 --> 00:29:17.986]  Well, I mean, they'd go in and bring the site down and post, you know, a naked woman on a motorcycle, stuff like that.
[00:29:17.986 --> 00:29:21.969]  And we had to trigger it where if somebody went in and did that, it would just bring the site down.
[00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:25.592]  So if it was hacked, we had a fail-safe to just bring the site down.
[00:29:25.592 --> 00:29:27.074]  So I said, you know what?
[00:29:27.074 --> 00:29:29.275]  Every time I'm attacked, I just launch more websites.
[00:29:29.275 --> 00:29:32.058]  You know, it's a superhero analogy.
[00:29:32.058 --> 00:29:39.383]  You know, I guess Marvel and the others, you know, all have their characters where you hit it, you attack it, it just gets stronger.
[00:29:39.383 --> 00:29:41.245]  We work harder when we're attacked.
[00:29:42.248 --> 00:29:48.112]  A lot of times with stalkers and disinfo agents attack us, I go, that's it, I'm just going to work until three in the morning.
[00:29:48.112 --> 00:29:51.834]  In fact, you give us our strength.
[00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:55.776]  And I know you can't stop it's your nature to just keep giving us the strength.
[00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:59.599]  Because your curses, we turn into blessings, God does.
[00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.500]  And you need to know that.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.942]  Because it just enrages you to do it even more!
[00:30:12.385 --> 00:30:16.307]  Sorry, some aftershocks from a celebration earlier.
[00:30:16.307 --> 00:30:16.808]  Yeah!
[00:30:16.808 --> 00:30:17.608]  Thank you, God!
[00:30:17.608 --> 00:30:19.069]  Thank you, Jesus!
[00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:19.749]  I love it!
[00:30:19.749 --> 00:30:21.970]  I love what's happening!
[00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:27.874]  We just believe in victory, have the information, move forward without fear or concern for our own lives.
[00:30:27.874 --> 00:30:33.877]  We will have victory!
[00:30:33.877 --> 00:30:35.158]  I'm not doing this to lose.
[00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:39.887]  I'm not doing this because I don't think the enemy can't be beaten.
[00:30:39.887 --> 00:30:42.409]  I'm doing this because I know we can win!
[00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:46.612]  Woo!
[00:30:46.612 --> 00:30:48.694]  Yeah!
[00:30:48.694 --> 00:30:52.277]  I need to compose myself a bit and then later get more into this.
[00:30:52.277 --> 00:30:53.418]  I got Dick Begich coming up.
[00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.899]  Dr. Begich and Butch Pa.
[00:30:54.899 --> 00:30:55.900]  Butch will want to talk about this.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.281]  We'll talk about it with Begich.
[00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:58.422]  We'll open the phones up for you.
[00:30:58.422 --> 00:31:01.384]  You want to talk about this?
[00:31:01.384 --> 00:31:02.745]  And see, it's a chain reaction.
[00:31:02.745 --> 00:31:04.386]  It's hardest for the first person to do it.
[00:31:04.386 --> 00:31:05.087]  The trailblazer!
[00:31:06.764 --> 00:31:07.464]  Lewis and Clark.
[00:31:07.464 --> 00:31:11.385]  They don't remember the guys that came right after them, which was just as hard.
[00:31:11.385 --> 00:31:13.086]  The trailblazer.
[00:31:13.086 --> 00:31:17.207]  The guy that hit the barbed wire.
[00:31:17.207 --> 00:31:21.428]  Charlie Sheen.
[00:31:21.428 --> 00:31:25.249]  No, it wasn't Mel Gibson.
[00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:28.910]  It wasn't Rick Linklater.
[00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.971]  It wasn't the Dixie Chicks, who, listen, right here in Austin, and they're great people, and we know their folks.
[00:31:33.755 --> 00:31:37.917]  Who know all about it and have seen Road to Tyranny four years ago who will not go public on it.
[00:31:37.917 --> 00:31:41.898]  That's fine!
[00:31:41.898 --> 00:31:45.320]  It isn't Keanu Reeves.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:53.523]  It isn't... Mr. Downing.
[00:31:53.523 --> 00:31:57.264]  Or Woody Harrelson.
[00:31:57.264 --> 00:32:03.027]  Or... Folks like... I won't even say their names.
[00:32:03.027 --> 00:32:03.367]  I shouldn't.
[00:32:04.608 --> 00:32:09.151]  No, they, they didn't go public.
[00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:10.712]  When they knew about it.
[00:32:10.712 --> 00:32:14.974]  For whatever reasons.
[00:32:14.974 --> 00:32:16.915]  They didn't.
[00:32:16.915 --> 00:32:17.936]  And that's okay.
[00:32:17.936 --> 00:32:21.498]  Nobody said they had to.
[00:32:21.498 --> 00:32:22.618]  But Charlie Sheen did.
[00:32:22.618 --> 00:32:31.363]  And that's why I admire him so much.
[00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:32.684]  That's why I admire Charlie Sheen.
[00:32:34.409 --> 00:32:38.312]  Because he has got so much courage, and he knew what would happen.
[00:32:38.312 --> 00:32:44.358]  And boy, you saw what happened to him after he didn't shut up.
[00:32:44.358 --> 00:32:49.822]  A few weeks after he went public, they told him, you shut your mouth through the grapevine of their ways.
[00:32:49.822 --> 00:32:52.124]  I shouldn't even get into it.
[00:32:52.124 --> 00:32:55.067]  It's hard to hold your tongue when you know just how much a hero somebody is.
[00:32:55.771 --> 00:33:02.575]  When somebody's told point-blank, and then he went on Jimmy Kimmel, and I told him, I said, don't do it, Charlie, you don't need to say anything.
[00:33:02.575 --> 00:33:04.175]  They threatened him, and he said, you know what?
[00:33:04.175 --> 00:33:07.297]  And he went on there, and they brought it up, and he talked about it.
[00:33:07.297 --> 00:33:08.278]  The Pentagon.
[00:33:08.278 --> 00:33:11.679]  And World Trade Center 7.
[00:33:11.679 --> 00:33:18.583]  And the next day, they attacked him with the most vicious lies you can imagine!
[00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:34.419]  But I tell you, getting the silver medal is still good, David Lynch.
[00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:39.502]  It's wonderful.
[00:33:39.502 --> 00:33:41.483]  The house of cards has fallen.
[00:33:41.483 --> 00:33:52.548]  I mean, listen, you heard Steele, the founder of Marine Corps Intelligence on, high-level CIA clandestine, in the field, you know, actual James Bond type.
[00:33:53.354 --> 00:33:54.675]  Highly respected.
[00:33:54.675 --> 00:33:57.216]  Tell you clearly they could indict Dick Cheney for doing it.
[00:33:57.216 --> 00:33:59.457]  You've heard German defense ministers.
[00:33:59.457 --> 00:34:00.797]  You've heard members of parliament.
[00:34:00.797 --> 00:34:02.698]  You've heard members of Blair's cabinet.
[00:34:02.698 --> 00:34:06.920]  You've heard members of the last Bush administration, George W.'
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.641]  's first term.
[00:34:08.641 --> 00:34:15.204]  You've heard all these scientists and experts, but people don't listen to them like they listen to somebody from Hollywood.
[00:34:16.144 --> 00:34:30.310]  But it resonated that much stronger because people knew the courage it took for Charles Sheen to do what he did.
[00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.271]  Unbelievable.
[00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:34.292]  Just, uh!
[00:34:34.292 --> 00:34:37.853]  I mean, that type of example, just exemplary.
[00:34:37.853 --> 00:34:39.474]  Everything that's good about man.
[00:34:39.474 --> 00:34:41.335]  Everything that's good about our history.
[00:34:41.335 --> 00:34:44.336]  The finer things, the finer attributes that God's given us.
[00:34:46.027 --> 00:34:54.931]  Just absolutely fabulous.
[00:34:54.931 --> 00:34:58.093]  You're here to hear news and information.
[00:34:58.093 --> 00:35:14.361]  Normally I learn these type of things when I'm off air and would be busy working on getting a text report out, working on getting a story out, and would kind of consume myself with those, consume my energy in the action, but just being here on air
[00:35:17.272 --> 00:35:18.533]  I'm almost speechless here.
[00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:19.893]  This is just so good.
[00:35:19.893 --> 00:35:24.774]  Do you realize that the dam is breaking?
[00:35:24.774 --> 00:35:28.435]  The dam is breaking.
[00:35:28.435 --> 00:35:32.417]  In every way, on every subject.
[00:35:32.417 --> 00:35:40.139]  And it's getting faster and faster in its implosion.
[00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:44.120]  Meanwhile, we have a disgusting example of traitorous, lecherous, scrupulous,
[00:35:45.911 --> 00:35:51.254]  Filth with the Democrats saying, we're going to increase the troops.
[00:35:51.254 --> 00:35:54.536]  We're going to stay there many more years.
[00:35:54.536 --> 00:35:57.517]  We can't let the Iraqis down.
[00:35:57.517 --> 00:36:15.227]  When Ray McGovern, high-level CIA analyst, gave the presidential brief to Reagan and Bush Senior, has told you that clearly our government and other Western governments are staging terror attacks in Iraq, that they will stage the trigger events to kick off escalating conflict
[00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:26.392]  Between the Sunnis, the Shiite, the Kurds, and even the subgroups of those three main groups.
[00:36:26.392 --> 00:36:28.393]  The plan was to break it in three parts.
[00:36:28.393 --> 00:36:30.094]  The plan was to balkanize it.
[00:36:30.094 --> 00:36:36.136]  The plan was to take a first world nation with 60% of their college graduates being women.
[00:36:36.136 --> 00:36:41.998]  60 plus percent, I think the number was 64% of their new doctors being women.
[00:36:41.998 --> 00:36:43.119]  That's higher than the U.S.
[00:36:46.457 --> 00:36:55.244]  I mean, if you judge it by Western standards, shopping malls, rock and roll music, Playboy on the shelves.
[00:36:55.244 --> 00:37:01.990]  Becoming a big tourist destination for Europeans and Americans to go see the Babylonian ruins.
[00:37:03.456 --> 00:37:10.462]  Because Saddam was a CIA boy put in back when there was another policy to just take over nations and set him up and develop it.
[00:37:10.462 --> 00:37:20.229]  Well, that policy changed and the new policy was set him up, tell him to go ahead and go into Kuwait like we told him to go into Iran, and then pull the rug out from under him.
[00:37:20.229 --> 00:37:25.433]  And he was a murderer, but compared to the other people in that region, the guy was a choir boy.
[00:37:25.433 --> 00:37:30.878]  And now you don't have any Jews living in peace in Iraq.
[00:37:30.878 --> 00:37:32.479]  Now the Christians are getting kicked out.
[00:37:33.422 --> 00:37:39.889]  The Christians that have been there for 2,000 years.
[00:37:39.889 --> 00:37:44.553]  There have been Christians for over 1,900 years in Iraq.
[00:37:44.553 --> 00:37:54.803]  There are 1,800 year old chapels in the mountains in the north.
[00:37:54.803 --> 00:37:56.065]  There are no Christians there now.
[00:37:58.459 --> 00:38:02.081]  Because the Globalists back the Islamists.
[00:38:02.081 --> 00:38:03.922]  They took them after World War II.
[00:38:03.922 --> 00:38:05.864]  Hitler had used them.
[00:38:05.864 --> 00:38:06.924]  Our government funded them.
[00:38:06.924 --> 00:38:07.825]  The British funded them.
[00:38:07.825 --> 00:38:09.846]  The Israelis, when they got in, funded them.
[00:38:09.846 --> 00:38:14.209]  To radicalize and bring down leaders, whether they were good, bad, or indifferent.
[00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:15.649]  They weren't controlled by the Globalists.
[00:38:15.649 --> 00:38:16.830]  They were brought down.
[00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:24.595]  And now they use this threat that they have forged, that they took a little seed and grew it into a mighty oak, and now
[00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:31.225]  They threaten the West with it while bringing in record numbers of Muslims into Europe and the U.S.
[00:38:31.225 --> 00:38:33.226]  and Canada.
[00:38:33.226 --> 00:38:43.353]  Until you give up all your rights and let the police order you around and let them database you and let them search you and track you while the border stays wide open.
[00:38:43.353 --> 00:38:50.838]  Or the Islamofascist will get us!
[00:38:50.838 --> 00:38:51.939]  It's disgusting.
[00:38:53.473 --> 00:38:57.557]  It's so obvious, but forget the obviousness of it.
[00:38:57.557 --> 00:38:58.317]  It's admitted.
[00:38:58.317 --> 00:38:59.639]  It's documented.
[00:38:59.639 --> 00:39:09.547]  Operation Cyclone and all the other declassified programs could do just what you now see happening.
[00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:13.431]  The New World Order crime syndicate that runs our country is getting rid of our borders.
[00:39:13.431 --> 00:39:15.112]  We're in the North American Union now.
[00:39:15.112 --> 00:39:16.634]  They have the bureaucracies merging.
[00:39:19.272 --> 00:39:32.442]  The very people destroying our country's sovereignty are the ones that are bringing in the foreigners at record clips, and then funding the organizations for the last 50 years plus?
[00:39:32.442 --> 00:39:37.025]  Maybe 52 years, as you can track definite funding.
[00:39:37.025 --> 00:39:46.492]  And then, meanwhile, radicalizing these people when many of them don't even understand who they're controlled by, and they can't even see the strings that lead back to the New World Order.
[00:39:50.043 --> 00:39:56.345]  So that's the score, that's what we're dealing with, that's what we're looking at right now.
[00:39:56.345 --> 00:39:57.226]  Here's another one.
[00:39:57.226 --> 00:39:58.166]  Jerusalem Post.
[00:39:58.166 --> 00:40:00.807]  Israel and Iran holding secret talks.
[00:40:00.807 --> 00:40:08.270]  While Iran continues to deny that Israel has the right to exist, Iranian and Israeli representatives are holding clandestine talks in Europe to settle the old Israeli debt.
[00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.891]  Iraq's reported Wednesday.
[00:40:09.891 --> 00:40:10.571]  Iran is still
[00:40:12.058 --> 00:40:16.441]  Owned hundreds of millions of dollars for oil that's supplied to Israel in the years before the Islamic Revolution in 79.
[00:40:16.441 --> 00:40:27.248]  And representatives of the two countries, now sworn enemies, are holding contacts between to settle the debt according to the report in Haratz.
[00:40:27.248 --> 00:40:30.290]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.372]  They're in a mediation process.
[00:40:33.372 --> 00:40:36.274]  Here's an interesting tidbit on 9-11, a sad one.
[00:40:36.274 --> 00:40:39.235]  New York Daily News, Blaze Kills Daughter of 9-11 Pilot.
[00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:43.504]  The 9-11 pilot, my friends.
[00:40:43.504 --> 00:40:45.165]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[00:40:45.165 --> 00:40:56.134]  Tragedy struck a 9-11 family for the second time when the daughter of one of the hijacked pilots was killed in a suspicious, suspicious blaze.
[00:40:56.134 --> 00:41:00.017]  In New Jersey yesterday.
[00:41:00.017 --> 00:41:03.239]  Wendy Merlin game.
[00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:04.881]  A clear hit if there ever was one.
[00:41:04.881 --> 00:41:06.282]  We'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:41:07.168 --> 00:41:08.569]  Stay with us.
[00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:20.677]  It was an inside joke, by the well-connected.
[00:41:20.677 --> 00:41:26.641]  You're a bit of protest, so merrily rejected.
[00:41:26.641 --> 00:41:31.745]  It was an inside joke, like it always is.
[00:41:38.409 --> 00:41:49.974]  I know it's hard sometimes to stand out in the light because it's an inside job.
[00:41:49.974 --> 00:41:56.216]  Keep rolling.
[00:41:56.216 --> 00:41:57.636]  It came and took it all away.
[00:41:59.727 --> 00:42:00.868]  Disappear.
[00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:13.474]  While you are looking the other way, they'll take your right to own your own ideas.
[00:42:13.474 --> 00:42:24.920]  And if an inside job favors the left hand, your trusted servants have left you a prediction.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.621]  Was an inside job
[00:42:29.807 --> 00:42:30.387]  That's right.
[00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:11.148]  I know it's hard sometimes to live out in the light, but if you don't, you're gonna be enslaved.
[00:43:27.295 --> 00:43:30.098]  I know what I've done wrong.
[00:43:30.098 --> 00:43:33.641]  I am acquainted with the night.
[00:43:33.641 --> 00:43:39.186]  I know how hard it is to always walk out in the light.
[00:43:39.186 --> 00:43:46.072]  And it's an inside job to learn about forgiving.
[00:43:46.072 --> 00:43:50.596]  ...part in Drills, and then he supposedly was one of the pilots who then died.
[00:43:51.835 --> 00:43:58.239]  Tragedy struck a 9-11 family for the second time when the daughter of one of the hijacked pilots was killed in a suspicious blaze.
[00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:01.281]  This is New York Daily News saying that, by the way.
[00:44:02.071 --> 00:44:09.573]  Tragedy struck a 9-11 family for a second time when the daughter of one of the hijacked pilots was killed in a suspicious blaze in New Jersey yesterday.
[00:44:09.573 --> 00:44:18.456]  Wendy Burlingame, 32, and her two dogs died when flames ripped through the 10-floor apartment in Gutenberg, Hudson County.
[00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:24.098]  Burlingame was the daughter of American Airlines pilot Chuck Chick Burlingame, whose plane crashed in the Pentagon.
[00:44:25.177 --> 00:44:26.298]  On September 11th.
[00:44:26.298 --> 00:44:28.559]  I mean, I don't have enough riders to ride all this stuff up.
[00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:33.862]  I mean, this is the guy who ran drills or flying hijack jets in the World Trade Center months before.
[00:44:33.862 --> 00:44:38.765]  And then he's the supposed pilot on this non-existent plane that flies into it.
[00:44:38.765 --> 00:44:42.747]  And I wonder if Burlingame was like the majority of victims' family members.
[00:44:42.747 --> 00:44:44.248]  I wonder if she was about to go public.
[00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:46.870]  You know they got their phones tapped 24-7.
[00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:48.751]  Sounds like a firebombing to me.
[00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:51.313]  The neighbors hear a big commotion and then just flames.
[00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:57.313]  Just, I mean, folks, instant flame you can't even get out of.
[00:44:57.313 --> 00:45:21.873]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:45:28.474 --> 00:45:29.814]  Big Brother.
[00:45:29.814 --> 00:45:31.575]  Mainstream media.
[00:45:31.575 --> 00:45:33.336]  Government cover-ups.
[00:45:33.336 --> 00:45:34.917]  You want answers?
[00:45:34.917 --> 00:45:36.477]  Well, so does he.
[00:45:36.477 --> 00:45:40.699]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:46.082]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:45:46.082 --> 00:45:51.484]  We're going in, through, and beyond.
[00:45:51.484 --> 00:45:53.645]  We're engaging the New World Order.
[00:45:55.330 --> 00:46:03.794]  We are having victory after victory after victory!
[00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.975]  Ugh!
[00:46:04.975 --> 00:46:06.955]  Horrible news, though.
[00:46:06.955 --> 00:46:09.557]  I mean, this has got murder written all over it.
[00:46:09.557 --> 00:46:12.038]  And that's even what the New York Daily News is saying.
[00:46:12.038 --> 00:46:14.559]  We need to report out on this instantly.
[00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:16.320]  It's basic analysis.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.502]  Blaze kills daughter of 9-11 pilot.
[00:46:20.502 --> 00:46:22.803]  And they go on to say it is suspicious.
[00:46:23.661 --> 00:46:30.528]  Tragedy struck a 9-11 family the second time the daughter of one of the hijacked pilots was killed.
[00:46:30.528 --> 00:46:39.158]  And it's, of course, the pilot was Mr. Burlingame, Chick Burlingame, whose plane crashed in the Pentagon on September 11th.
[00:46:39.158 --> 00:46:41.981]  It's just an example of extreme tragedy, said Tim.
[00:46:42.962 --> 00:46:53.528]  Sumner, who knew Wendy Burlingame from the 9-11 Family Survivor Group.
[00:46:53.528 --> 00:47:00.572]  It's just an extreme tragedy, said Tim Sumner, who knew Wendy Burlingame from the 9-11 Family Survivor Group.
[00:47:00.572 --> 00:47:02.593]  It's an amazing blow to that family.
[00:47:02.593 --> 00:47:09.137]  Wendy Burlingame's aunt, Deborah Burlingame, a member of the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation Board, was too heartbroken to speak last night.
[00:47:10.074 --> 00:47:12.215]  The fire broke out at about 12.30 a.m.
[00:47:12.215 --> 00:47:17.479]  in the Galaxy Towers apartment building, shared with her fiancé, Kevin Roderick.
[00:47:17.479 --> 00:47:20.581]  I wonder when she met Kevin.
[00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:25.384]  Met the handsome young man, taking good care of her, I would imagine, in the last year or so.
[00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:29.987]  Neighbors said Burlingame moved into the apartment overlooking the Hudson River about a month ago.
[00:47:29.987 --> 00:47:31.428]  Roderick escaped the fire.
[00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:35.173]  They say suspicious.
[00:47:35.173 --> 00:47:36.275]  The paper does, not me.
[00:47:36.275 --> 00:47:38.037]  The police are saying suspicious.
[00:47:38.037 --> 00:47:40.721]  But they'll quiet down quickly, I would imagine.
[00:47:41.872 --> 00:47:47.454]  Firefighters battled the stubborn blaze for about three hours before bringing it under control.
[00:47:47.454 --> 00:47:52.895]  Firefighters found Burlingame's body in a hallway between the kitchen and the bathroom, investigators said.
[00:47:52.895 --> 00:47:57.496]  It is suspicious at this point because the cause and the origin have not been established.
[00:47:57.496 --> 00:48:03.818]  Hudson County Prosecutor Edward DeFazio said DeFazio said the fire damaged neighboring apartments.
[00:48:03.818 --> 00:48:10.180]  A neighbor reported hearing a commotion coming from Burlingame's apartment just before the fire alarms in the building
[00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:11.680]  Sounded.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:17.943]  Her father took part in CIA drills.
[00:48:17.943 --> 00:48:21.884]  This is mainstream news.
[00:48:21.884 --> 00:48:25.305]  There were multiple drills in the year before 9-11, of course drills that morning.
[00:48:25.305 --> 00:48:28.526]  He took part in drills.
[00:48:28.526 --> 00:48:32.808]  We've always said this is a key player, one of the few key points
[00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:36.248]  We have attempted to contact family members.
[00:48:36.248 --> 00:48:37.269]  They won't talk.
[00:48:37.269 --> 00:48:39.329]  You get them on the phone, they'll say, no, no.
[00:48:39.329 --> 00:48:40.229]  And they'll say it's dangerous.
[00:48:40.229 --> 00:48:40.749]  I can't talk.
[00:48:40.749 --> 00:48:41.450]  Firefighters.
[00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:42.710]  No, my wife doesn't want me to.
[00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:43.910]  And I've had women scream at me.
[00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.070]  It's happened multiple times.
[00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:45.971]  Get off the phone with them!
[00:48:45.971 --> 00:48:47.131]  They told you!
[00:48:47.131 --> 00:48:48.171]  You ought to get on the phone with them.
[00:48:48.171 --> 00:48:53.092]  I remember that when I talked to Cacioli.
[00:48:53.092 --> 00:49:04.055]  I remember when we got on the phone with the head of the Defense Language School, briefly, right after he was in the AP, talking about how they were forced to train some of the hijackers in high-level
[00:49:05.186 --> 00:49:06.026]  Spy.
[00:49:06.026 --> 00:49:06.647]  Signals.
[00:49:06.647 --> 00:49:09.088]  Training.
[00:49:09.088 --> 00:49:10.768]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:10.768 --> 00:49:11.809]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:16.711]  I wonder how many people will be firebombed.
[00:49:16.711 --> 00:49:18.211]  I wonder how many people will die.
[00:49:18.211 --> 00:49:33.117]  This is, I would say, because of who she is, and her father being one of the keys, I'd have to say with this, 90% chance, I'm even more sure, but let's just say 90% that she was murdered.
[00:49:35.703 --> 00:49:41.708]  And, uh, I would be talking to her boyfriend right now just to see what he saw.
[00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:43.990]  I'm sure he's a nice person.
[00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.170]  He probably is a nice person.
[00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:49.314]  Probably, you know, probably might have been a gas main or something.
[00:49:49.314 --> 00:49:50.655]  Who knows what it was?
[00:49:50.655 --> 00:49:55.478]  I mean, maybe someone planted a firebomb in the building.
[00:49:55.478 --> 00:49:56.619]  He knew nothing about it.
[00:49:56.619 --> 00:49:59.441]  Probably not connected.
[00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:04.185]  Just the police are saying it's suspicious.
[00:50:04.185 --> 00:50:05.266]  People should talk to him.
[00:50:06.468 --> 00:50:07.794]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:07.794 --> 00:50:08.717]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:50:30.261 --> 00:50:31.581]  Big Brother.
[00:50:31.581 --> 00:50:33.342]  Mainstream media.
[00:50:33.342 --> 00:50:35.102]  Government cover-ups.
[00:50:35.102 --> 00:50:36.703]  You want answers?
[00:50:36.703 --> 00:50:38.243]  Well, so does he.
[00:50:38.243 --> 00:50:42.445]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:42.445 --> 00:50:50.988]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:50:50.988 --> 00:50:56.850]  The top-tier director
[00:50:58.415 --> 00:51:02.418]  Scores of films and TV programs.
[00:51:02.418 --> 00:51:05.440]  It's gone public, questioning the official 9-11 story.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.000]  It is huge.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.104]  The video is going up on JonesReport.com right now for you.
[00:51:11.104 --> 00:51:14.186]  David Lynch speaks out on 9-11.
[00:51:14.186 --> 00:51:16.027]  There are many questions, no answers.
[00:51:16.027 --> 00:51:18.969]  We'll play that again before this hour ends.
[00:51:19.816 --> 00:51:29.921]  Also, the daughter of the Flight 77 pilot, Charles Chick Burlingame, who had been part of government drills of flying hijacked jets into buildings in the year before.
[00:51:29.921 --> 00:51:32.803]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[00:51:32.803 --> 00:51:35.664]  I mean, that is unbelievable.
[00:51:35.664 --> 00:51:39.386]  She was consumed in flame.
[00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:42.108]  Her boyfriend got out of the apartment.
[00:51:42.108 --> 00:51:46.830]  The police and the district attorney are calling it suspicious.
[00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:48.691]  And she is now dead.
[00:51:49.631 --> 00:51:51.532]  Consumed by flame.
[00:51:51.532 --> 00:51:58.874]  Extremely, extremely, extremely suspicious that this happened.
[00:51:58.874 --> 00:52:00.054]  We haven't had him on in about a year.
[00:52:00.054 --> 00:52:15.619]  I'm always honored to have him join us and we're carrying, in time for you to get it, before Christmas, remember any, I didn't plug last hour, my films, Terror Storm, the other books and videos like America Freedom to Fascism we're carrying, our new 9-11 inside job t-shirt as low as $9.95,
[00:52:17.418 --> 00:52:27.405]  It's about getting the word out this holiday season, this Christmas holiday that's coming up, and we guarantee that you will get materials shipped to you days before Christmas.
[00:52:27.405 --> 00:52:28.946]  We ship at UPS Ground.
[00:52:28.946 --> 00:52:38.213]  If you order by the 15th, any orders that come in by, you know, the midnight of the 15th, we will then ship it out overnight.
[00:52:38.213 --> 00:52:44.598]  That is, we'll work that night and then that Saturday to make sure it all gets out, so you get it days before Christmas.
[00:52:47.029 --> 00:52:55.158]  Please go to Infowars.com and peruse the secure online, safe video and bookstore there or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:52:55.158 --> 00:52:56.879]  About a month ago I got a copy of the book
[00:53:03.209 --> 00:53:08.332]  And finally, in two nights, I had to steal time for myself to be able to read books.
[00:53:08.332 --> 00:53:12.695]  I, on my bedside, read it quickly, but still a substantive book.
[00:53:12.695 --> 00:53:17.458]  It's all in little info nodes or nodules.
[00:53:17.458 --> 00:53:23.622]  And I knew a lot of it, but learned a lot, because he uses open and government source and declassified documents to prove it.
[00:53:23.622 --> 00:53:25.884]  It reads like some scary science fiction movie.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:34.442]  And that's controlling the mind, the technology, political control or tools for peak performance.
[00:53:34.442 --> 00:53:36.623]  And that's a paperback book.
[00:53:36.623 --> 00:53:38.343]  Handsome book.
[00:53:38.343 --> 00:53:47.846]  And then Mind Control, A Brave New World for Enhancing Human Performance, the DVD, which is, most people watch videos, so most of you will probably be getting that as a gift, but if you're a reader,
[00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:51.654]  One of those dangerous Al-Qaeda types.
[00:53:51.654 --> 00:53:53.777]  Then you'll probably want to get the book and the DVD.
[00:53:53.777 --> 00:53:58.705]  You can get them both separately or get them together and there's a big discount when you get them together.
[00:53:59.887 --> 00:54:02.508]  And, uh, we've got the UPS tracking number.
[00:54:02.508 --> 00:54:07.649]  They are scheduled to arrive here in my office tomorrow, and we will start shipping them out to you.
[00:54:07.649 --> 00:54:12.911]  So order them today via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:12.911 --> 00:54:16.712]  We've gotten a parcel of these from Dr. Nick Begich, which there's no way to go over his bio.
[00:54:16.712 --> 00:54:23.874]  His dad was a famous congressman who died under suspicious circumstances, who'd been trying to make sure that the people of Alaska and America got some of the oil.
[00:54:24.875 --> 00:54:26.296]  He has been elected to office.
[00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:30.301]  His brother is in high office in Alaska.
[00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:41.534]  He is a scientist, a doctor, has published and written a score of books, and made a whole parcel of powerful videos, and is a frequent guest on national television and radio.
[00:54:41.534 --> 00:54:45.178]  And he works also with the Inuit indigenous population.
[00:54:46.118 --> 00:54:53.904]  And he's also a professor, and we are honored to have Dr. Nick Begich on with us, and I hope everybody will go get his book and video at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:53.904 --> 00:54:55.165]  Thanks for coming on, sir.
[00:54:55.165 --> 00:54:57.726]  Well, thank you for having me, and it has been a while.
[00:54:57.726 --> 00:55:08.494]  You know, we've been busy working on this project for now a couple of years, and we consider it, I consider it, the best we've put together, because it really encapsulates, I think, the most important issue.
[00:55:08.494 --> 00:55:10.756]  I mean, the domain of the human mind is
[00:55:11.525 --> 00:55:23.477]  Certainly what everyone is trying to influence one way or the other, but the technology and the things that have happened over the decades makes this really, I think for this century, the most important story.
[00:55:24.419 --> 00:55:25.459]  Going into the century.
[00:55:25.459 --> 00:55:33.501]  It is, and before we... Yes, and before we get into it, I'm going to try to sedate myself and lean back here and let you go over it.
[00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:36.302]  The different types of mind control, the programs, the stuff that's admitted.
[00:55:36.302 --> 00:55:48.045]  Would you like to mention or comment on the breaking news of the Flight 77 pilot's daughter dying in a huge flash of fire, but her, quote, boyfriend escaping and the police calling it suspicion.
[00:55:48.045 --> 00:55:53.166]  Suspicious, and would you like to comment on the legendary director, David Lynch, speaking out on 9-11?
[00:55:54.315 --> 00:55:58.256]  Well, you know, I think a lot of this, um, it's really about government accountability.
[00:55:58.256 --> 00:56:01.117]  And I think it's been the central theme in a lot of our work.
[00:56:01.117 --> 00:56:08.699]  And I know in your work, uh, you know, the idea of, um, hiding, uh, and being behind and then people disappearing or something happening.
[00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:13.520]  You know, I personally experienced that with my dad during a time when things were pretty controversial.
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:15.641]  In fact, it reminds me of the time we're in today.
[00:56:15.641 --> 00:56:23.483]  It was back during, uh, that first, um, uh, the Watergate and the Nixon administration, the abuses of the CIA and FBI that came out later.
[00:56:24.228 --> 00:56:25.129]  It's a repeat.
[00:56:25.129 --> 00:56:35.976]  We're going through the same thing, but on top of it is a 30-plus year layer of new technologies that make the invasiveness even more extreme.
[00:56:35.976 --> 00:56:49.064]  And when you look at the national scene, we've seen this creep come in where we're really engaged in an environment of fear and paranoia being thrust on us.
[00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:50.566]  By the government.
[00:56:50.566 --> 00:56:52.168]  It's not from average people.
[00:56:52.168 --> 00:56:54.009]  It's coming from the top down.
[00:56:54.009 --> 00:56:54.550]  Exactly.
[00:56:54.550 --> 00:57:00.216]  There's overt mind control with the TV, the fear, the basic opera conditioning.
[00:57:00.216 --> 00:57:06.782]  Let's run through the gamut of the different types of mind control manipulation that you break down in the book and the video.
[00:57:06.782 --> 00:57:10.286]  And let's go through the patented, admitted technologies that are now in place.
[00:57:10.879 --> 00:57:16.705]  Well, when you start to look at what's possible, you've got to look right into the Air Force and their own documents.
[00:57:16.705 --> 00:57:21.910]  And what they talk about in the most recent materials are what are called controlled effects.
[00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:23.171]  And they address sort of
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:28.182]  Three aspects, hardware, computers, but then ultimately the human being.
[00:57:28.182 --> 00:57:32.083]  And there's a publication that the Air Force puts out.
[00:57:32.083 --> 00:57:35.284]  It's their publication, Technology Horizons.
[00:57:35.284 --> 00:57:42.207]  And there was an article in June 2004 from their Electromagnetic Directorate down in Maxwell Air Force Base.
[00:57:42.207 --> 00:57:45.088]  And most people don't even know such a directorate exists.
[00:57:45.088 --> 00:57:49.229]  But these are the guys that develop various forms of energy-based
[00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:51.050]  weapons technologies.
[00:57:51.050 --> 00:58:00.673]  And as a result, what we've seen is this sort of view that maybe, just maybe, manipulating the human being is the ultimate target.
[00:58:00.673 --> 00:58:04.934]  Here's the quote from that particular issue, and it's an interesting one.
[00:58:04.934 --> 00:58:12.355]  It says, By studying and modeling the human brain and nervous system, the ability to mentally influence or confuse personnel is also possible.
[00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:14.856]  Through sensory deception, it may be possible
[00:58:15.396 --> 00:58:25.232]  To create synthetic images or holograms to confuse an individual's visual sense or in a similar manner confuse his senses of sound, taste, touch, or smell.
[00:58:25.232 --> 00:58:29.459]  In other words, they can create complete sensory experiences.
[00:58:30.263 --> 00:58:31.804]  is the direction of this research.
[00:58:31.804 --> 00:58:35.045]  And what we've seen in the open literature is sort of the direction of it.
[00:58:35.045 --> 00:58:56.172]  Back in the 90s when we were engaged in our battle over the harp issue, you know, one of those aspects of harp, a high-frequency active auroral research project here in Alaska, was this idea that in certain ranges it could influence human mental activity, either as a purposeful activity or a side effect.
[00:58:56.172 --> 00:58:57.493]  And as we began to look at that,
[00:58:58.075 --> 00:58:59.977]  We ran into so much material.
[00:58:59.977 --> 00:59:16.033]  I mean, there was work from Persinger at Laurentian University talking about sending energy into the magnetic field lines of the Earth in such a way that you could literally cover the planet and change the entire attitude of millions, billions of people.
[00:59:16.033 --> 00:59:18.756]  And that work, actually, at Laurentian
[00:59:19.718 --> 00:59:23.121]  Kind of took the overview, you know, it was really affecting emotional states.
[00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:29.105]  And when you looked at Persinger's work, you can even go back to the work being done by J.F.
[00:59:29.105 --> 00:59:37.650]  Gordon MacDonald at UCLA as a geophysicist, saying the same things back in 1969 in a book called Unless Peace Comes.
[00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:45.616]  When you start to look at sort of where this all begins, it begins, you know, in terms of mind control, you've got to go back to the very early days
[00:59:46.178 --> 00:59:46.919]  Thank you for having me.
[01:00:01.278 --> 01:00:06.702]  And this guy continues to surface from the 20s all the way to the early 60s.
[01:00:06.702 --> 01:00:16.748]  We looked at his material, kind of looked at what he was doing, and his idea was to create sort of the ultimate spy by using hypnosis as the tool.
[01:00:16.748 --> 01:00:23.332]  And what he did is take people down into a very deep hypnotic state and split their personalities deliberately.
[01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:24.833]  He talked about this in his 1943 book,
[01:00:26.774 --> 01:00:29.856]  It's called Hypnotism, which was revised in 1957.
[01:00:29.856 --> 01:00:40.721]  And then his other book, which gets into split personality, an interesting title, 1947, it was called Spiritism by Esther Brooks.
[01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:50.286]  By 1961, he had written the book The Future of the Human Mind, where he actually in 61 was suggesting LSD be used for behavior modification.
[01:00:50.286 --> 01:00:54.268]  And if people remember, that was the same time frame that the CIA was
[01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:59.058]  engaged in MK Alters programs and doing exactly that.
[01:00:59.058 --> 01:01:07.965]  And introduced not just pharmacological grade LSD, but also put out the recipe.
[01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:08.705]  Right, right.
[01:01:08.705 --> 01:01:16.551]  And not only did they do all this, but in conjunction with it, there was a major, major investigation of this.
[01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:24.277]  When Watergate happened, people need to remember it was CIA, excuse me, ex-CIA, if there ever is such a thing, that was supposed to break in.
[01:01:25.064 --> 01:01:33.606]  There was a big report, and it was June 1975, it was issued, and it was a report to the President by the Commission on CIA Activities within the United States.
[01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:43.829]  And within that, it dealt with, of course, all the standard stuff the CIA was doing to abuse us, like intercepting our mail and our phone communications and infiltrating various groups around the country.
[01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:46.150]  Kind of sounds familiar, sounds like today.
[01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:56.071]  They also talked about the use and the MKUltra program and the use of military and civilian personnel, unwitting victims.
[01:01:56.071 --> 01:02:00.776]  As we began to look at that whole story, we ran into a tremendous amount of data.
[01:02:01.946 --> 01:02:02.847]  And it runs the gamut.
[01:02:02.847 --> 01:02:10.051]  I mean, there are program plans, you know, to have helicopters fly around and spray hallucinogens on whole cities or knock out opiate gases.
[01:02:10.051 --> 01:02:17.495]  There are plans to have different antenna arrays manipulating our minds, the fluoride in the water, the mass drugging.
[01:02:17.495 --> 01:02:19.216]  There's so many different layers to this.
[01:02:19.216 --> 01:02:25.499]  So I want to go from low-tech to high-tech, which the book and the film runs the gamut of, with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:02:25.499 --> 01:02:26.580]  We're honored to have him stay with us.
[01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:47.815]  Our lives mean nothing to the globalists.
[01:02:47.815 --> 01:02:52.660]  They revel in being ruthless.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:03:04.814]  And if they'd sterilized 400 plus thousand women in America, secretly, and keep it secret for 40 years, plus, really longer, went on from the 20s into the mid-80s when it went public, so that's 60-something years.
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.471]  Then, what will they do today?
[01:03:08.471 --> 01:03:18.254]  I mean, if they have the power to have antenna arrays to make us nauseous, to make us happy, to make us sleepy, to make us docile, to damage us, they will do it!
[01:03:18.254 --> 01:03:21.175]  Again, I go off past activities, past behavior.
[01:03:21.175 --> 01:03:26.177]  Hitler got his ideas from scientists here, and scientists in England.
[01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:32.339]  And John D. Rockefeller funded the big institutes of eugenics in Germany, before Hitler even came to power.
[01:03:34.608 --> 01:03:36.769]  Understand, they have developed it.
[01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:37.509]  It is here.
[01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:39.710]  The question is, how far along is it?
[01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:41.471]  How will they use it against us?
[01:03:41.471 --> 01:03:43.092]  Dr. Nick Baggage, please continue.
[01:03:43.092 --> 01:03:44.912]  Yeah, you know, it's gone much further.
[01:03:44.912 --> 01:03:49.054]  You know, hypnosis is very crude compared to what is happening today.
[01:03:49.054 --> 01:04:02.199]  I mean, the ability to affect both in terms of private parties being able to develop this technology, that is probably the most proliferating technology around, because it's pretty flat.
[01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:03.660]  It's not high-tech in terms of
[01:04:04.335 --> 01:04:06.536]  Big dollars and billion dollar laboratories.
[01:04:06.536 --> 01:04:12.679]  There's enough data that's been developed over the years to allow many to take a look at this technology, begin to apply it.
[01:04:12.679 --> 01:04:16.121]  And I believe that many of these things have been applied.
[01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:23.965]  When you look at, you know, early reports on mind control and controlling offense, controlled offensive behavior.
[01:04:23.965 --> 01:04:25.046]  I've got a paper from 1972.
[01:04:25.046 --> 01:04:29.388]  It's a declassified Defense Intelligence Agency paper.
[01:04:29.855 --> 01:04:30.075]  We're good.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:46.680]  I think so.
[01:05:08.127 --> 01:05:13.772]  Uh... Ian Shomertek, the big law enforcement catalog, and I put this in my film Road to Tyranny, talk about low-tech.
[01:05:13.772 --> 01:05:27.683]  They say, oh, law enforcement uses this to disrupt crowds and to mess up political speakers, and the cops are openly saying this, and it's the sonic nausea machine, the supersonic nausea, and it's fun to torture people in prisons, and that's just a low-tech
[01:05:28.123 --> 01:05:28.983]  Right.
[01:05:28.983 --> 01:05:32.164]  You know, system being sold in the law enforcement catalog.
[01:05:32.164 --> 01:05:32.385]  Right.
[01:05:32.385 --> 01:05:45.289]  Now, the way that happened is a joint protocol was evolved starting in the mid-80s between the Department of Justice, which opened the dialogue, with the Department of Defense to try and get access to non-lethal weapon systems.
[01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:50.351]  They had a series of conferences, we documented in the book, Controlling the Human Mind, and
[01:05:51.001 --> 01:05:57.867]  Through these conferences, they recognize that they really probably ought to keep these things open, because the public would immediately be suspicious.
[01:05:57.867 --> 01:05:59.369]  Well, of course, the next conference... Exactly!
[01:05:59.369 --> 01:06:05.715]  Who was the big, uh... Before I forget, under Megitch, he's... I think he was the head of the Air Force.
[01:06:05.715 --> 01:06:06.976]  It was about a month ago.
[01:06:06.976 --> 01:06:08.698]  Came out in September 13th.
[01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:09.018]  You're right.
[01:06:09.278 --> 01:06:33.446]  Yeah, and said, we need to use our microwave guns on the American people, because then that hides it, this was in the Associated Press, then that hides it in plain view, and convinces foreigners it's okay to use in war, so now they're deploying these to the police departments, and then meanwhile, people ask what Camp X-ray is, because they admit everybody there is totally innocent, then they came out and admitted it is a mind-control laboratory, but, sorry, go ahead.
[01:06:33.446 --> 01:06:37.948]  Yeah, and that's, you know, the dish that's being, you know, on the top of these Humvees,
[01:06:38.456 --> 01:06:38.796]  I think so.
[01:06:56.386 --> 01:06:56.626]  I don't
[01:07:18.692 --> 01:07:21.074]  Ninth grade education didn't know which button to push.
[01:07:21.074 --> 01:07:28.860]  Oh no, they admit that it goes from narrow beam, which will hurt you, to wide beam for just causing excruciating pain.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:36.065]  And I mean, next, and I saw DARPA talk about this, we'll just have the microwave towers, but just in case we have a riot, they just flip the switch.
[01:07:36.065 --> 01:07:46.213]  And this also allows a tiny elite, a tiny group, even the police and military don't follow their orders for tyranny, a tiny group has these automated systems.
[01:07:46.213 --> 01:07:47.113]  That's correct.
[01:07:48.484 --> 01:07:50.166]  We also looked at another paper.
[01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:52.127]  This is an unpublished paper.
[01:07:52.127 --> 01:07:55.690]  It's by one of the world's leading physicists in biophysics.
[01:07:55.690 --> 01:08:04.838]  It's called the Dangerous Benefits and Countermeasures for Artificial and Natural Specific Frequency and Waveform Magnetic Field Interaction with Biological Systems.
[01:08:04.838 --> 01:08:05.339]  Stay there!
[01:08:05.339 --> 01:08:05.879]  Stay there!
[01:08:05.879 --> 01:08:08.221]  All over the country.
[01:08:08.221 --> 01:08:09.022]  All over the country.
[01:08:09.022 --> 01:08:12.705]  They got monkeys and other mammals strapped up constantly testing it.
[01:08:12.705 --> 01:08:15.547]  And it's all being tested to be used on you.
[01:08:20.194 --> 01:08:24.122]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:08:24.122 --> 01:08:26.847]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:48.895 --> 01:08:51.878]  Let me put it in layman's terms.
[01:08:51.878 --> 01:08:53.759]  DARPA and the military, i.e.
[01:08:53.759 --> 01:09:16.319]  the government, is funding over 80% of the raw research going on at major universities, and my friend is in a high-level position at the UT Psychology Department, that's all I'll say, and a few years ago I was given a tour of it, of the non-classified areas, and it was all at the entrance to each of these labs, and these are research labs, there aren't students involved,
[01:09:16.943 --> 01:09:19.466]  Or in some cases graduate students assist.
[01:09:19.466 --> 01:09:21.669]  You will have posted on the door who's funding it.
[01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:25.894]  DARPA, DARPA, DARPA, Department of Defense, Air Force, Army.
[01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:27.335]  And they weren't hiding it.
[01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:34.444]  Across the street that's monitored by cameras, across the street, they have got a whole underground building just full of monkeys.
[01:09:35.262 --> 01:09:51.674]  And they put wires into their brain, they strap them in front of screens, and it's a huge, just endless project, just testing the flickering rate of televisions to register brainwaves on monkeys, and they admit that is then used by the government.
[01:09:51.674 --> 01:09:53.815]  They don't ask why.
[01:09:53.815 --> 01:09:56.457]  Again, we know television puts you into a mesmerized state.
[01:09:56.457 --> 01:09:57.358]  That's admitted.
[01:09:57.358 --> 01:10:04.183]  Video games are in an even lower state because of the concentration involved, combined with the flicker, and Dr. Begich is an expert on all that.
[01:10:04.978 --> 01:10:16.542]  Okay, I remember the Baltimore Sun about four years ago saying, oh, there's a plan with DARPA to put up towers that will put out different wavelengths of energy to soothe crowds during crises.
[01:10:16.542 --> 01:10:20.444]  So imagine, people put these in, they don't even know what they're putting in.
[01:10:20.444 --> 01:10:27.666]  They're now going into mechanized, I wouldn't call them robots, but mainly remote-controlled mini-tanks, combat droids.
[01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:28.927]  These are being used in Iraq.
[01:10:29.891 --> 01:10:38.618]  Uh, the South Koreans just came out with a policeman, a robot that's, you know, and, and, I mean, they show video of it, threatening to blow people's heads off.
[01:10:38.618 --> 01:10:45.183]  For a tiny elite, you thought they were bad on 9-11, flying remote-controlled planes into buildings, with hijackers who were really U.S.
[01:10:45.183 --> 01:10:49.546]  government agents, thinking they were taking part in a drill, an infiltration drill.
[01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:53.569]  Just like the BATF practices taking bombs on planes, it was the same thing, it was an infiltration drill.
[01:10:53.569 --> 01:10:57.672]  Uh, I mean, we're in deep trouble, okay?
[01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:00.736]  These grids are going in for control.
[01:11:00.736 --> 01:11:02.618]  Dr. Begich, am I exaggerating?
[01:11:02.618 --> 01:11:03.279]  Am I kidding?
[01:11:03.279 --> 01:11:05.281]  Or, I mean, what does your research show?
[01:11:05.281 --> 01:11:07.343]  No, in fact, you're dead on right.
[01:11:07.343 --> 01:11:11.047]  Starting with the flicker rate on television, this is something people don't recognize.
[01:11:11.047 --> 01:11:20.636]  You know, subliminals, words that you hide in the screen, were made illegal back in the 50s when they used to use them in movie theaters to get you to buy more soda pop and popcorn.
[01:11:21.383 --> 01:11:29.672]  And what happened is they realized that this violated the rules because it bypasses the conscious, goes right into the subconscious.
[01:11:29.672 --> 01:11:40.964]  And according to Smirnoff at the Psychocorrection Institute, now part of the Russian Academy of Sciences, he actually said that it's so compelling, it's like a commandment of God, it cannot be disobeyed.
[01:11:41.533 --> 01:11:52.417]  But getting rid of that, you remember the first Bush election where Junior was running and he got caught using a subliminal where he used the word rats in an ad talking about Democrats.
[01:11:52.417 --> 01:11:55.879]  He got caught and he said, oh, it was a mistake, it was the advertise company.
[01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:57.239]  Well, there's more to it than that.
[01:11:57.239 --> 01:12:01.541]  The flicker rate is even more important because here's what they can do with just an advertisement.
[01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:05.823]  You're sitting there watching passively, your brain goes into this passive state.
[01:12:05.823 --> 01:12:09.084]  If you maintain a light flicker rate based on the changing of the
[01:12:09.608 --> 01:12:10.449]  We're good to go.
[01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:41.688]  Everyone involved in advanced research in psychology and advanced research in advertising understands these principles and applies them.
[01:12:41.688 --> 01:12:42.669]  Here's an example.
[01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:56.958]  Six years ago, this is one of the highly publicized ones, remember Toyota ran a group of ads in Europe and a group of film students were slowing it down frame by frame and it was talking about kill your baby, bloody baby, bloody moon, human sacrifice,
[01:12:58.022 --> 01:12:59.662]  And folks, that was Times of London, okay?
[01:12:59.662 --> 01:13:00.623]  We're not kidding.
[01:13:00.623 --> 01:13:07.544]  Now, when the company got caught, they said, well, our ad agency in London did it, and we don't mean this to be satanic.
[01:13:07.544 --> 01:13:12.705]  We've found it gets your attention when you see your baby's gonna die, which it does.
[01:13:12.705 --> 01:13:19.006]  So it's a way to force you, when you see that subconscious, your brain reads it, suddenly you get attention.
[01:13:19.006 --> 01:13:21.946]  Now, I've seen this with other people's children, with my own children.
[01:13:21.946 --> 01:13:23.606]  My children hardly ever watch television.
[01:13:23.606 --> 01:13:26.887]  A few times they're able to see network news, or ads especially,
[01:13:27.627 --> 01:13:27.987]  Right.
[01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:30.069]  You know, there's a very simple method really applied.
[01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:32.590]  It's just mainly dealing with the flicker rate or the oscillations within
[01:13:51.861 --> 01:13:52.382]  I think so.
[01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:16.372]  A psychotronic generator which produces a powerful electromagnetic emanation capable of being sent through telephone lines, TV radio networks, supply pipes and incandescent lamps.
[01:14:16.372 --> 01:14:21.617]  This signal would manipulate the behavior of those in contact with the signal.
[01:14:21.617 --> 01:14:22.198]  In other words,
[01:14:23.055 --> 01:14:30.099]  Any electromagnetic carrier can be used to sort of piggyback another signal that affects us on an emotional level.
[01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:40.965]  And then now they have authorized, and are using it, information transmission over power lines, which can also easily mask and be a carrier signal for the main signal.
[01:14:40.965 --> 01:14:41.885]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:41.885 --> 01:14:45.887]  It came up actually in a documentary I participated in.
[01:14:45.887 --> 01:14:48.849]  It was by CBC TV, which is the public television
[01:14:49.409 --> 01:14:50.050]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:15:03.543 --> 01:15:13.327]  Reagan White House with decline and proposed this whole initiative in non-lethal weapons that eventually became in fact the very systems we're talking about.
[01:15:13.327 --> 01:15:21.390]  And their real name is less lethal, but they've changed it to non-lethal, but we see how non-lethal they are at the Red Sox game where they blow the girl's head off.
[01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:23.811]  Right, you know, non-lethal is a loose term.
[01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:32.875]  When we testified in February 5, 1998 in the European Parliament on non-lethal weapons, as a guest of the European Parliament,
[01:15:33.514 --> 01:15:37.115]  We got a resolution passed on security and disarmament.
[01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:44.137]  Within that resolution, with three sections on HAARP, and then the fourth section, the most important from my perspective, reads as follows.
[01:15:44.137 --> 01:15:59.101]  It's from the European Resolution, European Parliament Resolution A40005 forward slash 99, and it says, and I quote, it calls for an international convention introducing a global ban on all development and deployment of weapons which might enable any form
[01:15:59.668 --> 01:15:59.949]  Of course.
[01:16:12.382 --> 01:16:15.083]  ...was passed by a vote.
[01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:23.228]  And what happened is, we formed a coalition, starting with conservatives who understand civil liberties from a very, very different perspective.
[01:16:23.228 --> 01:16:29.391]  Then the Greens got involved for environmental considerations, and then the Social Democrats got involved.
[01:16:29.391 --> 01:16:33.713]  And in Europe, that's kind of like the Republicans and Democrats shaking hands.
[01:16:33.713 --> 01:16:40.176]  And we got it passed by the highest percentages, and it's because we actually demonstrated in the hearing
[01:16:40.678 --> 01:16:47.460]  An infosound device, a device that transfers sound through the nervous system into the brain, where you hear that proverbial voice in the head.
[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:55.502]  And we suggested at that hearing that the United States would soon develop a wireless method, if they hadn't already, using microwaves.
[01:16:55.502 --> 01:17:08.105]  And last year, if people were paying attention, Woody Norris won the MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lemelson Prize for microwave heterodyning, where he actually transferred voice, just like people hear us today,
[01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:16.279]  Drop it right into the heads of an individual at a distance in a way that was never done before.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.240]  We're good to go.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.084]  Well, look, their argument is we have to develop it and use it or somebody else with.
[01:18:01.084 --> 01:18:02.244]  That's always their excuse.
[01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:04.526]  We know it's a criminal group.
[01:18:04.526 --> 01:18:12.691]  As Mr. Steele, a high-level former CIA said yesterday, now about 30% of the economy is now totally criminal.
[01:18:12.691 --> 01:18:15.773]  It's taking over the other 70%.
[01:18:15.773 --> 01:18:17.414]  And they're going to use this against us.
[01:18:17.414 --> 01:18:18.695]  They are using it against us.
[01:18:19.969 --> 01:18:21.090]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:29.337]  Well, and it's just part of, you know, as we looked at technology over the last 12 years and have written our material and compiled it, you know, there's a lot more to come.
[01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.118]  I can tell you that.
[01:18:30.118 --> 01:18:41.307]  We're putting together a conference of people, a closed conference actually, a closed conference of the good guys, and we're bringing together eight or nine of the top scientists that I've met in my career.
[01:18:41.877 --> 01:18:43.438]  that have risen and fallen.
[01:18:43.438 --> 01:18:54.687]  In other words, they've been challenged because they've challenged authority and been beaten down and risen out of the ashes of those defeats into much more powerful and strong individuals who maintain their character.
[01:18:54.687 --> 01:18:59.171]  In those tough times, we're bringing a number of biophysicists and physicists.
[01:18:59.171 --> 01:19:11.621]  These are some of the top rated in their field in the world, and they've agreed to come to a closed conference in Dallas being hosted by the Lay Institute on Technology, which is a nonprofit, a Dallas nonprofit.
[01:19:12.194 --> 01:19:17.476]  Texas-based nonprofit that I serve as Executive Director of, and also I serve on the board.
[01:19:17.476 --> 01:19:22.539]  And it was founded by Dorothy Lay, whose family is well-known in Texas.
[01:19:22.539 --> 01:19:30.682]  She was the daughter and is the daughter of Herman Lay, who founded Lay Potato Chips and merged it with Frito and later PepsiCo.
[01:19:30.682 --> 01:19:33.984]  And she is so interested in these impacts on technology.
[01:19:33.984 --> 01:19:36.105]  Well, you've got to be!
[01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:40.847]  And she's decided that funding the public education effort to make sure that there's
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:46.683]  A good discussion and the direction of these technologies might be better set.
[01:19:46.683 --> 01:19:55.828]  And what we found, you know, in all of this work, is by bringing these experts together, and a few years ago they probably would not have come, but there's enough data now.
[01:19:55.828 --> 01:20:09.516]  I've had two physicists review the book, Controlling the Human Mind, Thompson Biophysics, that say it's the best material written not just for laypeople, but it's written in plain language in a way that everyone can understand, but the footnotes are so compelling.
[01:20:10.032 --> 01:20:13.575]  That is exactly what's been needed for years to kick off this debate.
[01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:27.245]  And Sonoma State University, which runs Project Censored, this week is releasing a study of a compilation of literature on this issue of mind control with the intent to push this issue into the public forum.
[01:20:27.245 --> 01:20:36.472]  The Washington Post is scheduled for a cover story in the Washington Post magazine where we'll be quoted in February on the mind control issue.
[01:20:36.472 --> 01:20:39.575]  So the mainstream is even starting to pay attention because
[01:20:40.447 --> 01:20:47.539]  People, when they look at this issue, I don't care where your political background is, the domain of the human mind is sacred.
[01:20:47.539 --> 01:20:48.401]  Look, it's simple.
[01:20:48.401 --> 01:20:52.468]  If we allow cloistered elites, the crime syndicate,
[01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:53.187]  I think so.
[01:21:13.855 --> 01:21:15.876]  And again, there's so many levels to propaganda.
[01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:28.301]  There's the social conditioning, then you couple the social conditioning images through television with the flicker rate, which then directs it directly into the subconscious and blocks out any cognitive dissonance to what they're doing.
[01:21:28.301 --> 01:21:35.784]  Now, Dr. Begich, though, getting conscious of this control and really not letting yourself fall back into that mesmerized state, that sleepwalking,
[01:21:36.804 --> 01:21:44.549]  I mean, is that one of the effective things we can each individually do in our own lives to start becoming conscious?
[01:21:44.549 --> 01:21:53.693]  And also, removing the one-eyed monster that sits in our living rooms and literally restricting it only to research, which is what I do.
[01:21:53.693 --> 01:21:58.376]  I have to watch certain clips, certain things that were said, but I literally take it very serious.
[01:21:58.376 --> 01:21:59.576]  And look, this isn't a joke, okay?
[01:21:59.576 --> 01:22:01.297]  I'm being very serious here.
[01:22:01.297 --> 01:22:01.898]  I watch TV.
[01:22:03.119 --> 01:22:10.725]  In a very controlled manner, and I even catch myself after a few minutes, you know, getting relaxed, shutting back into... I mean, folks, this is serious!
[01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:20.334]  Yeah, I think, you know, when you look at sort of the low-tech approaches, you know, just fatiguing the population, getting us worn out every day... Terror, terror, terror, terror, yeah.
[01:22:20.334 --> 01:22:29.502]  Yeah, and then fear is the next thing, and if you look at the brain activity under fear and that kind of stress and anxiety, you get what are referred to as incoherent
[01:22:30.183 --> 01:22:33.026]  Brain patterns, the kind that don't lend themselves to good thinking.
[01:22:33.026 --> 01:22:47.239]  On the other hand, when you experience the positive emotions, love, empathy, compassion, you find that the brain falls into these very rhythmic patterns, the kind that are apparent when you're involved in highly intellectual or creative work.
[01:22:47.239 --> 01:22:55.267]  In other words, when we're calm and focused, we can actually direct the traffic around us in a much more way, better way than the flight
[01:22:55.769 --> 01:22:58.751]  Uh, and fight response of an agitated personality.
[01:22:58.751 --> 01:22:59.772]  And people know this.
[01:22:59.772 --> 01:23:01.073]  Propagandists know this.
[01:23:01.073 --> 01:23:05.957]  And so, the red alert and the yellow alert and the orange alert, it's all about agitating the population.
[01:23:05.957 --> 01:23:08.639]  So the 6 o'clock news, when you come home... Islamofascist!
[01:23:08.639 --> 01:23:09.420]  Islamofascist!
[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:10.481]  Islamofascist!
[01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:10.801]  Right.
[01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:17.606]  And it just feeds right into that subconscious and ends up... Then, every event that sort of amplifies that effect.
[01:23:17.606 --> 01:23:21.930]  And when you look back, historically, you can look at the document, the Revolutionary Military Affairs,
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:28.221]  In Conflict Short of War, which Maxwell Air Force Base in 84 talked about these technologies.
[01:23:28.221 --> 01:23:30.941]  You can go back to 1989 U.S.
[01:23:30.941 --> 01:23:43.944]  Army War College and it's the Revolutionary Military Affairs in Conflict Short of War that talked about all these new technologies sort of emerging that would violate and fall in the face of American values and would be resisted.
[01:23:43.944 --> 01:23:45.244]  Well, you know, at the U.S.
[01:23:45.244 --> 01:23:48.584]  Army War College, you would think at that point, well, it doesn't fit American values.
[01:23:48.584 --> 01:23:49.585]  Can't do it.
[01:23:49.585 --> 01:23:50.905]  But that's not what they did.
[01:23:50.905 --> 01:23:51.985]  The rest of that report
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:57.523]  In fact, a copy of that report is on the CD-ROM that goes with the Mind Control.
[01:23:57.523 --> 01:23:58.403]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:23:58.403 --> 01:24:12.510]  Everybody's got to get the video, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance, because it's a book in and of itself, because it comes with a CD-ROM with thousands of pages and documents, so it's all footnoted in the film.
[01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:14.131]  We've done this online with Marshall Law.
[01:24:14.651 --> 01:24:17.592]  My last big film, you know, a volunteer did it.
[01:24:17.592 --> 01:24:25.075]  He went and found every article we cited, every document we cited, and then on timecode did it online at marshalllaw911.info.
[01:24:25.075 --> 01:24:27.516]  Dr. Begich includes with the DVD film,
[01:24:28.388 --> 01:24:30.749]  Another CD that has all the documents.
[01:24:30.749 --> 01:24:36.593]  This is invaluable for especially professors and teachers and law enforcement personnel.
[01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:39.314]  Everybody needs to be aware of these technologies.
[01:24:39.314 --> 01:24:41.236]  They are being used against us right now.
[01:24:41.236 --> 01:24:42.236]  Many of them are.
[01:24:42.236 --> 01:24:44.818]  And folks, they're available at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:24:44.818 --> 01:24:45.258]  Get the book.
[01:24:45.778 --> 01:24:46.359]  Get the film.
[01:24:46.359 --> 01:24:46.959]  The film's the best.
[01:24:46.959 --> 01:24:49.741]  You'll get the film and the CD-ROM when you get the film.
[01:24:49.741 --> 01:24:54.905]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:24:54.905 --> 01:25:06.794]  That's Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance DVD, the book, Controlling the Human Mind, The Technologies of Political Control, or Tools for Peak Performance.
[01:25:06.794 --> 01:25:08.556]  And let's briefly talk about peak performance.
[01:25:08.556 --> 01:25:11.138]  You put a positive thing there.
[01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:11.498]  We had
[01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:41.398]  Wired Magazine, about six years ago, an article called the Marshall Plan, a pun, but it was the Pentagon Futurist, eighty-something years old, looks like Dr. Evil, Mr. Marshall, saying in the future, it won't be what weapons we have, but what drugs and what systems we have our soldiers under, and it's talking about, literally, the bionic man, and now I've talked to special forces and other families in the military, my friend, they told me they were going to get the chip, now they've told me they've gotten the chip.
[01:25:41.838 --> 01:25:47.964]  Right, this was, you can see it again, 1989, it's in the Revolution of Military Affairs, Conflict Shore to War.
[01:25:47.964 --> 01:26:01.858]  And that document basically said the only way these new technologies would be allowed or be permitted or be accepted by the American population was an environment of fear created by international terrorism and international drug trafficking.
[01:26:01.858 --> 01:26:04.260]  All they were waiting was for an event.
[01:26:04.756 --> 01:26:15.165]  And 9-11 gave them their event, and then they basically began to implement the control of this population in a way that no civilization has ever seen before.
[01:26:15.165 --> 01:26:17.307]  You're under attack from every angle.
[01:26:17.307 --> 01:26:27.075]  From the social worker trying to grab your children, Dr. Begich clearly having his father killed, to the daughter of the 77 pilot being firebombed.
[01:26:27.075 --> 01:26:28.736]  We're under attack, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:28.736 --> 01:26:29.757]  They're not playing games.
[01:26:29.757 --> 01:26:31.278]  This is about survival.
[01:26:31.278 --> 01:26:31.739]  Stay with us.
[01:26:34.324 --> 01:26:34.724]  I think so.
[01:26:52.429 --> 01:26:54.270]  Okay, I want to take a call or two for Dr. Nick Beggars.
[01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:55.891]  He'll be with us five minutes to the next hour.
[01:26:55.891 --> 01:27:01.895]  The pastor, Bush Paws, joining us because he found out about some mind control type stuff.
[01:27:01.895 --> 01:27:13.022]  The group Retina Scanning and Thumbprinting the Children at the schools in West Virginia and nationwide is the human experimentation group out of the university.
[01:27:13.022 --> 01:27:15.084]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:27:15.924 --> 01:27:26.772]  Dr. Begich, I think really the biggest illustration of how evil this elite is, is the admissions of black men to Skigi, the atomic soldiers, Project Shad, nerve-gassing our own troops.
[01:27:26.772 --> 01:27:28.593]  You know well about it, you've written about it.
[01:27:28.593 --> 01:27:36.419]  I mean, this is a cold-blooded technocracy that sees humans as a scourge, and as human life is cheaper than dirt.
[01:27:36.419 --> 01:27:42.303]  And so folks, I think, don't need to judge the world according to their own meek view.
[01:27:42.303 --> 01:27:44.965]  They need to see it from these inbred elitists.
[01:27:46.074 --> 01:27:53.721]  You know, that whole issue of where it's gone, it is gone much further than anything that most anticipate.
[01:27:53.721 --> 01:28:05.752]  You know, the chemical means and the old methods have been replaced now with much more sophisticated technologies that can dial in to the human brain, almost the same as dialing in the radio stations.
[01:28:05.752 --> 01:28:10.156]  I mean, at that precision, what's coming and what we talk about in the book is
[01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:11.232]  I think so.
[01:28:23.261 --> 01:28:24.542]  That's the direction we're going.
[01:28:24.542 --> 01:28:29.084]  In other words, figuring out enough about how information transfers to the brain to replicate it.
[01:28:29.084 --> 01:28:35.827]  They're using three supercomputers next year in Switzerland, tied together to start to look at the human brain.
[01:28:35.827 --> 01:28:45.171]  And one of these supercomputers, to do the same thing that it does in a second, would take 6.6 billion people with hand calculators 60 hours to accomplish.
[01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:49.973]  Now, at the same time, we have these elites
[01:28:51.053 --> 01:28:52.814]  Well, you know, it's literally billions of dollars.
[01:28:52.814 --> 01:28:58.616]  Black projects in the Air Force equipment alone amount to about 40% of their budget as of the late 90s.
[01:29:13.542 --> 01:29:14.282]  I was looking at it.
[01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:16.964]  Isn't it over a trillion dollars in the last 50 years?
[01:29:16.964 --> 01:29:18.405]  Probably easily that.
[01:29:18.405 --> 01:29:22.787]  I mean, I would say easily that, because these are crossover technologies.
[01:29:22.787 --> 01:29:36.855]  They affect a lot of different areas, and when you start to look at them and literally connect the various technologies, which is what we tried to do, you can see how that literal matrix appears on the planet.
[01:29:36.855 --> 01:29:43.179]  It's a technology matrix, you know, and I talk about, and for 12 years I've been talking about technology and
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:51.268]  During the break we were talking about the fact that, you know, I've been doing this a long time, we've been covering these issues a long time, trying to get them out.
[01:29:51.989 --> 01:29:59.096]  Unfortunately, unfortunately, programs like this give us a chance to get into these issues and debate them.
[01:29:59.096 --> 01:30:00.318]  Well, there is a dual edge.
[01:30:00.318 --> 01:30:12.750]  You know, DARPA invented what the Internet is today, and its double-edged sword, which they thought would be a worldwide wiretap, has turned out to be something that's really causing the globalist problems.
[01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:13.551]  You talk about the first
[01:30:14.091 --> 01:30:14.451]  In fact, they
[01:30:39.264 --> 01:30:42.609]  They funded some of the seed money for that whole operation, but you're right.
[01:30:42.609 --> 01:30:46.054]  I mean, it's a better system than the government has.
[01:30:46.054 --> 01:30:49.018]  The government system has been widely criticized for their inefficiency.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:54.722]  You know, technology, technology in the 21st century is in fact where the action is.
[01:30:54.722 --> 01:30:59.303]  In democratic republics like ours, it's either going to make us slaves or make us free.
[01:30:59.303 --> 01:31:00.004]  Absolutely.
[01:31:00.004 --> 01:31:05.105]  Folks, get the DVD and it comes with a free CD with all the documents and proof on it.
[01:31:05.105 --> 01:31:09.107]  Mind Control, The Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance and the book.
[01:31:09.107 --> 01:31:12.368]  It's available at InfoWars.com or by calling the toll free number.
[01:31:12.368 --> 01:31:13.088]  We'll be right back.
[01:31:15.285 --> 01:31:17.708]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:17.708 --> 01:31:20.451]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:27.044 --> 01:31:28.364]  Big Brother.
[01:31:28.364 --> 01:31:30.125]  Mainstream media.
[01:31:30.125 --> 01:31:31.885]  Government cover-ups.
[01:31:31.885 --> 01:31:33.486]  You want answers?
[01:31:33.486 --> 01:31:35.047]  Well, so does he.
[01:31:35.047 --> 01:31:39.248]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:39.248 --> 01:31:43.329]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:31:56.548 --> 01:32:00.351]  Pastor Butch Pong is going to be joining us coming up with very important revelations.
[01:32:00.351 --> 01:32:02.112]  I'm going to recap some of the top stories.
[01:32:02.112 --> 01:32:05.615]  Another huge director has gone public on 9-11.
[01:32:05.615 --> 01:32:08.817]  There's been a suspicious death.
[01:32:08.817 --> 01:32:11.139]  We'll be talking about all of it.
[01:32:11.139 --> 01:32:12.380]  One hour is never enough time.
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:15.442]  We'll get Dr. Nick Begich up in the next few weeks again if we can.
[01:32:16.634 --> 01:32:19.276]  We are carrying his new film, Mind Control.
[01:32:19.276 --> 01:32:21.198]  It's unbelievable.
[01:32:21.198 --> 01:32:21.998]  You need to get it.
[01:32:21.998 --> 01:32:22.979]  It's all documented.
[01:32:22.979 --> 01:32:26.021]  And let's take a final call.
[01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:27.983]  Brian in Maryland, thanks for holding.
[01:32:27.983 --> 01:32:31.165]  Go ahead, you're on the air with Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:32:31.165 --> 01:32:34.027]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:32:34.027 --> 01:32:41.213]  I'd like to report a breaking news item from Maryland about a crisis management preparedness exercise.
[01:32:41.213 --> 01:32:44.115]  So they're having another takeover drill?
[01:32:44.696 --> 01:32:45.978]  That's exactly right.
[01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:52.345]  It's going to happen in the Bethesda area tomorrow, December 7th, between 10.30 a.m.
[01:32:52.345 --> 01:32:54.968]  and 3 o'clock p.m.
[01:32:54.968 --> 01:33:02.056]  and personnel from various local and national emergency service organizations, hospitals, and military
[01:33:02.802 --> 01:33:04.944]  We'll be participating in the exercise.
[01:33:23.516 --> 01:33:26.778]  Yeah, you know, it's all part of the conditioning, you know, process.
[01:33:26.778 --> 01:33:30.300]  You know, it's like very standard stuff.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:37.364]  You know, you want to drill, drill, drill, because then when it does happen, people are, you know, more organized to follow the orders and follow the script.
[01:33:37.364 --> 01:33:37.685]  I.E.
[01:33:37.685 --> 01:33:39.266]  Jim Jones and the Kool-Aid drill.
[01:33:39.266 --> 01:33:39.706]  Yep.
[01:33:39.706 --> 01:33:48.151]  You know, and all of this stuff leads people to do things that maybe otherwise they might not do, or they might click in the cognizant mind and start thinking a little bit more.
[01:33:48.151 --> 01:33:52.814]  Have you seen all the reports of where they go into schools and scream at elementary students who put guns in their heads?
[01:33:53.474 --> 01:33:57.677]  No, the nonsense has gotten totally out of control.
[01:33:57.677 --> 01:34:00.259]  It's about control, ultimately.
[01:34:00.259 --> 01:34:04.963]  We've barely touched the surface of this issue, and I know we'll be doing it again soon, I hope.
[01:34:04.963 --> 01:34:08.185]  Well, that's a domestication trauma-based mind control.
[01:34:08.185 --> 01:34:09.206]  That's classic.
[01:34:09.206 --> 01:34:15.210]  Yep, and it's kind of old-style, but when you have that going on and you overlay these other systems,
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:21.224]  You increase the efficiency of that dramatically.
[01:34:21.224 --> 01:34:31.593]  I think the biggest things are the electromagnetic systems where any carrier can be used.
[01:34:31.593 --> 01:34:33.174]  This is where the action is.
[01:34:33.174 --> 01:34:35.416]  This is where the breakthroughs are being made.
[01:34:35.416 --> 01:34:36.657]  On the flip side of this,
[01:34:37.225 --> 01:34:46.973]  We know that we can increase our human capacity in terms of mental capacity by 50 to 100 percent above what it is now with technologies that are available today.
[01:34:46.973 --> 01:34:52.397]  And that's what's being lost in this shuffle, is we're using it to destroy humankind when we ought to be able
[01:34:52.797 --> 01:34:55.519]  To enhance our performance, enhance our capabilities.
[01:34:55.519 --> 01:34:56.820]  We use 7 or 8% of our mind.
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:01.303]  But do it in a way that keeps the core of what it is to be human there.
[01:35:01.303 --> 01:35:06.526]  Instead, they're going into all the dark technologies meant to destroy humanity and take free will.
[01:35:06.526 --> 01:35:07.547]  That's exactly right.
[01:35:07.547 --> 01:35:17.414]  And you know, to have these technologies individually, and I say that with emphasis, individually available where we could amp up our brains in ways that are unprecedented.
[01:35:17.414 --> 01:35:22.577]  And some of the ways that it's being done are very simple, and it's not like something coming in and controlling you.
[01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:28.613]  It's you learning how to control that activity between our ears in a much more precision way.
[01:35:28.613 --> 01:35:30.873]  Just like learning how to ride a bicycle.
[01:35:30.873 --> 01:35:33.555]  And that kind of knowledge is out there.
[01:35:33.555 --> 01:35:36.076]  The very end of this book deals with some of that.
[01:35:36.076 --> 01:35:38.877]  The very end of the video deals with some of this.
[01:35:38.877 --> 01:35:40.358]  Let me tell the caller something real quick.
[01:35:40.358 --> 01:35:42.278]  Caller, will you send me an email about that?
[01:35:42.278 --> 01:35:43.559]  We'll post it.
[01:35:43.559 --> 01:35:43.859]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:43.859 --> 01:35:44.459]  I did.
[01:35:44.459 --> 01:35:46.040]  I sent it to Ryan.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:46.420]  Okay.
[01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:47.721]  Anything else?
[01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:48.441]  That's it, Alex.
[01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:49.001]  Thanks a lot.
[01:35:50.583 --> 01:35:52.264]  To both of you guys, you're right on there.
[01:35:52.264 --> 01:35:54.746]  Dr. Baggage, if I could do this, just keep you 10 more minutes.
[01:35:54.746 --> 01:36:02.291]  I want to get Pastor Butch Paul on right now, and then I want him to tell you about what he discovered in West Virginia, because it dovetails into everything you're talking about.
[01:36:02.291 --> 01:36:03.152]  Sounds great.
[01:36:03.152 --> 01:36:06.294]  You know, and I was just on with Pastor Butch Paul.
[01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:08.215]  I heard you about a week and a half ago.
[01:36:08.215 --> 01:36:09.176]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:09.176 --> 01:36:10.937]  Yeah, I listened to the broadcast.
[01:36:10.937 --> 01:36:14.680]  All right, we'll be right back with Dr. Nick Baggage and good old Pastor Butch.
[01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:36.953]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:36:36.953 --> 01:36:42.415]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[01:36:42.415 --> 01:36:45.135]  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'.
[01:36:45.135 --> 01:36:47.836]  There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.
[01:36:47.836 --> 01:36:52.837]  We fired once more and they forget to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:36:55.726 --> 01:37:17.397]  We looked down a river and we see'd the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drum They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[01:37:20.368 --> 01:37:23.071]  Old Hickory said we could take them by surprise.
[01:37:23.071 --> 01:37:25.953]  If we didn't fire muskets till we looked them in the eye.
[01:37:25.953 --> 01:37:28.475]  We held our fire till we see their faces well.
[01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:31.618]  Then we opened up the swirl guns and really gave them well.
[01:37:31.618 --> 01:37:34.921]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[01:37:34.921 --> 01:37:37.643]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[01:37:37.643 --> 01:37:40.326]  We fired once more and they forget to run it.
[01:37:40.326 --> 01:37:42.608]  From down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:50.934]  Yeah, they ran through the priors, and they ran through the brambles, and they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.
[01:37:50.934 --> 01:37:55.938]  They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch them, down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:38:01.079 --> 01:38:02.640]  All right!
[01:38:28.492 --> 01:38:32.699]  Having a little bit of fun there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:32.699 --> 01:38:34.803]  I dedicate this song to Paul Watson.
[01:38:34.803 --> 01:38:36.185]  I'm just teasing.
[01:38:36.185 --> 01:38:37.086]  Having a little bit of fun.
[01:38:37.086 --> 01:38:38.569]  You gotta joke around every once in a while.
[01:38:39.304 --> 01:38:44.891]  Dr. Nick Begich has agreed to stay with us through this segment, and we've got Pastor Butch Paugh on with us from West Virginia.
[01:38:44.891 --> 01:38:57.827]  Butch, why don't you encapsulate it for Dr. Nick Begich, the world expert, really, I have to say, at wide-spectrum analysis of these emerging and well-developed technologies of control.
[01:38:58.689 --> 01:39:04.297]  All over the country, universities and law enforcement groups are getting federal grants to thumb scan, retina scan the children.
[01:39:04.297 --> 01:39:07.001]  They basically come in and force it on the kids.
[01:39:07.001 --> 01:39:09.945]  The parents, a lot of times, are sent the letter the day before.
[01:39:09.945 --> 01:39:10.926]  No, it's for their safety.
[01:39:10.926 --> 01:39:13.150]  We're just, you know, getting them into the system.
[01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:25.357]  This is all part of the control, and then you discovered the group doing it was tied into human experimentation, quote, in the name of protecting the children, of course, and now I have a whole bunch of documents on that subject.
[01:39:25.357 --> 01:39:26.957]  Introduce us to this, Pastor Butch.
[01:39:26.957 --> 01:39:27.858]  Sure, and thank you Alex.
[01:39:27.858 --> 01:39:29.018]  I really appreciate it.
[01:39:29.018 --> 01:39:29.378]  Hi, Doc.
[01:39:29.378 --> 01:39:30.378]  Dr. Nick, how are you doing?
[01:39:30.378 --> 01:39:30.898]  I'm doing good.
[01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.039]  It's good to be talking to you again.
[01:39:32.039 --> 01:39:39.381]  I didn't think it would be quite so soon, and I certainly didn't expect to be running into you on the traffic corner of Alex Jones Show.
[01:39:39.381 --> 01:39:40.961]  That's a busy corner, too, by the way.
[01:39:41.161 --> 01:39:41.801]  Yeah, it is.
[01:39:41.801 --> 01:39:42.701]  It sounds that way.
[01:39:42.701 --> 01:39:45.662]  It's good to be talking with both of you guys again today.
[01:39:45.662 --> 01:39:58.245]  Well, anyway, to get on this very topic, now I have literally beside me, literally beside me in the hard copy, over a thousand pages of documentation, and I'm sure there's probably ten times more than that out there, if I can afford to get it all out here.
[01:39:58.245 --> 01:40:02.466]  But what brought this to my attention was a form that I received back in August.
[01:40:02.466 --> 01:40:03.687]  It's called Amberview.
[01:40:03.687 --> 01:40:06.007]  I'm sure every school in the nation is doing this.
[01:40:06.007 --> 01:40:08.808]  It's for returning children to the safety of their families.
[01:40:09.383 --> 01:40:12.124]  Pre-roll or garden consent and information form.
[01:40:12.124 --> 01:40:19.648]  The parents fill it out, they send this in with the children, they have their retina scanned, thumb scanned, put into the FBI database.
[01:40:19.648 --> 01:40:28.151]  Yeah, I forgot, a lot of schools like Westlake now here in Austin make you do it, and the parents have to thumb scan and retina scan to get in to get your children.
[01:40:28.151 --> 01:40:31.833]  It's a literal prison now, but let's talk about who's behind this.
[01:40:31.833 --> 01:40:37.515]  Well, as I read this paper that was given to me, I looked up at the right-hand corner, top right-hand corner, small print.
[01:40:37.515 --> 01:40:38.856]  You have a copy in front of you there, Alex.
[01:40:39.454 --> 01:40:44.777]  This is from the West Virginia, now folks listen very carefully, and I have massive documentation to prove this.
[01:40:44.777 --> 01:40:47.438]  Yeah, I've spent hours looking through it.
[01:40:47.438 --> 01:40:55.343]  West Virginia University Institution Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects.
[01:40:55.343 --> 01:41:02.887]  And right here in front of me too is a bill introduced in 1997 by Senator John Wynn, Human Research Subject Protections Act, 1997.
[01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:14.072]  Another page here is the Belmont Report on the Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research.
[01:41:14.072 --> 01:41:16.973]  I'm looking, and I have my guard down, as we can spin out of this.
[01:41:16.973 --> 01:41:26.675]  Federal law... And basically when you sign this, you wave your kids into being experimentation, and people think they're signing their kid up for a safety program, and now they're trying to say, oh, you've got to do it.
[01:41:26.675 --> 01:41:27.455]  This is incredible.
[01:41:27.455 --> 01:41:28.475]  Please continue.
[01:41:28.475 --> 01:41:31.076]  And I also have in front of me here from the Health and Human Services website,
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:42.688]  The underwriters, subcommittees, as you said, all the people involved in this, and my goodness, it's a three or four page document.
[01:41:42.688 --> 01:41:48.573]  Involved in this are the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, every federal department you can think of is involved in this.
[01:41:48.573 --> 01:41:55.819]  The reason it's Veterans Affairs is they admit they're tracking them and their scores for enlistment later.
[01:41:55.819 --> 01:41:58.221]  But that's one small part, go ahead.
[01:41:58.221 --> 01:42:00.503]  It's overwhelming.
[01:42:01.094 --> 01:42:13.053]  Uh, this article, April 19, 1979, the summary of this article, uh, from the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects, uh, Biomedical and Behavioral Research, on July 12, 1974, the National Research Act,
[01:42:14.622 --> 01:42:15.142]  We're good to go.
[01:42:34.773 --> 01:42:42.298]  Paragraph B, it authorizes the use of chemical and biologicals, even lethal, in quote, research on the American people.
[01:42:42.298 --> 01:42:45.500]  Let's get Dr. Begich to jump in here real quick before we continue, Butch.
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.020]  Okay, sure.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:50.743]  You know, this whole issue of human experimentation has come up periodically.
[01:42:50.743 --> 01:43:04.092]  We mentioned it in Earthrise and the Revolution when the administration of Bill Clinton admitted that over half a million Americans, Secretary of Energy O'Leary, said that over half a million Americans have been unwitting victims of human experimentation.
[01:43:04.813 --> 01:43:12.719]  And, you know, these kinds of consent forms that they're trying to get parents to sign, people need to look very, very closely when it comes to your children.
[01:43:12.719 --> 01:43:16.782]  Because, historically, children have been used in human experiments.
[01:43:16.782 --> 01:43:18.023]  Radiated!
[01:43:18.023 --> 01:43:18.584]  Yep.
[01:43:18.584 --> 01:43:19.565]  And they've admitted it.
[01:43:19.565 --> 01:43:26.730]  And the fact is, when they admit a half a million, you can multiply that by ten or twenty and get maybe close, but maybe not.
[01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:28.872]  I mean, I think that this is the problem.
[01:43:29.682 --> 01:43:37.888]  Why should the government be able to announce that we've had a half a million unwitting victims of human experiments in the United States and nobody be in jail?
[01:43:37.888 --> 01:43:39.989]  The government doesn't fall.
[01:43:39.989 --> 01:43:43.752]  Yeah, I mean, it's basically they grant immunity to these folks.
[01:43:43.752 --> 01:43:44.953]  They hide who they are.
[01:43:44.953 --> 01:43:48.776]  At the end of the day, it's all about accountability.
[01:43:48.776 --> 01:43:50.677]  And it needs to flip the other direction.
[01:43:50.677 --> 01:43:52.218]  We need a transparent government.
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:57.361]  Not an opaque one that's filled with too much smoke and mirrors to find the truth.
[01:43:57.361 --> 01:43:59.801]  We need the kind of open government... Well, here's an analogy.
[01:43:59.801 --> 01:44:05.242]  The cop pulls you over for no reason and wants to search your car, quote, because we're in a post-9-11 world.
[01:44:05.242 --> 01:44:07.443]  How about we search the government?
[01:44:07.443 --> 01:44:11.443]  These people killed us over and over again, premeditatedly.
[01:44:11.443 --> 01:44:12.443]  They can't be trusted.
[01:44:12.443 --> 01:44:14.364]  Now, Butch, continue with what you found.
[01:44:14.364 --> 01:44:21.065]  Well, as I look through these massive amounts of documents I have in front of me... As a matter of fact, I was on the computer listening to you, Dr. Nick, talk.
[01:44:21.065 --> 01:44:21.985]  I was digging up some more.
[01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:31.596]  They are now saying that they're explaining who are considered children, and they want to basically right now go with wards of the state.
[01:44:31.596 --> 01:44:37.939]  Children who maybe had no parents would say are in the VPS service systems.
[01:44:37.939 --> 01:44:41.661]  That came out of New York papers where they make the little black kids drink pesticide.
[01:44:41.661 --> 01:44:42.721]  That's right.
[01:44:42.721 --> 01:44:44.162]  That's all this is talking about.
[01:44:44.162 --> 01:44:45.643]  I've got thousands of pages here.
[01:44:45.643 --> 01:44:47.204]  I'm telling you folks, it's for real.
[01:44:47.204 --> 01:44:49.965]  And they also said that because ethics change,
[01:44:50.785 --> 01:44:53.087]  They can go further into this as time goes along.
[01:44:53.087 --> 01:45:03.095]  In other words, the principles and laws laid by today will change tomorrow, so we'll continue this research in more depth as the people are more immoral.
[01:45:03.095 --> 01:45:12.222]  And then I talked to the principal up there in Michigan where they put the guns to the kids' heads unannounced as they wet themselves crying and begging, and he said, oh, this is good training for them.
[01:45:12.222 --> 01:45:15.545]  You see how mutated that principal's brain is, Dr. Baggage?
[01:45:15.825 --> 01:45:16.745]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:16.745 --> 01:45:22.688]  Trauma-based conditioning is a classic method of controlling the human brain.
[01:45:22.688 --> 01:45:32.733]  And the fact of the matter is, when you look at this and you see just the overt nature of it, traumatizing children is not the answer.
[01:45:32.733 --> 01:45:34.014]  In fact, just the opposite.
[01:45:34.014 --> 01:45:35.855]  Children need nurturing.
[01:45:35.855 --> 01:45:38.656]  You have kids, and I have five children, and I know
[01:45:39.167 --> 01:45:41.331]  That kids do not need a trauma.
[01:45:41.331 --> 01:45:46.962]  I mean we have enough trauma coming at us just by living our normal lives to inflict it on children.
[01:45:47.805 --> 01:45:54.231]  Somebody belongs, not in the principal's office, they belong in jail for this kind of thing.
[01:45:54.231 --> 01:46:03.520]  Well, Nick, the reason I like having you on is I can mention an article and you've read it, and you even know more than I do on this subject, and I'm one of the people who knows more than almost anybody because I research it every day.
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:11.167]  And, you know, I'm sitting here, and I remember reading New York Daily News, folks, they take little black kids and they kill them.
[01:46:11.167 --> 01:46:13.409]  I mean, they murder them in plain, and this is not hidden.
[01:46:14.009 --> 01:46:22.173]  Okay, and finally, CPS workers blew the whistle so we heard about it, but then the state granted the biomedical companies doing the test protection.
[01:46:22.173 --> 01:46:25.714]  I mean, this isn't stopping, folks, and I'm sick of it!
[01:46:25.714 --> 01:46:33.358]  Does anybody out there think you're safe while these psychopaths are running things, and they've got a bunch of idiots in uniforms that will enforce whatever they say?
[01:46:33.358 --> 01:46:34.839]  Dr. Begich?
[01:46:34.839 --> 01:46:35.879]  Absolutely true.
[01:46:35.879 --> 01:46:40.741]  You know, there's an article, and it was the Washington Times, September 29th, 1994, and this is the quote.
[01:46:43.081 --> 01:46:51.526]  Children in orphanages were used to test experimental vaccines for diphtheria and whooping cough for several decades after World War II.
[01:46:51.526 --> 01:47:00.011]  And then it goes on, at least 500,000 people were used in Cold War era radiation, biological and chemical experiments sponsored by the federal government.
[01:47:00.011 --> 01:47:04.133]  A congressional agency said yesterday, this is from a 1997 report.
[01:47:04.133 --> 01:47:07.875]  This shows up in our book from 1999, Earth Rising and the Revolution.
[01:47:08.391 --> 01:47:08.531]  I don't
[01:47:22.475 --> 01:47:35.405]  I mean, we hung people at Nuremberg in Germany after World War II for these very same offenses, and then the CIA brought 700 Nazi scientists over here to continue this work in this country for the last 60 years.
[01:47:35.405 --> 01:47:37.607]  It's time to end the tyranny.
[01:47:37.607 --> 01:47:38.788]  It's time to get mad!
[01:47:40.269 --> 01:47:42.870]  Actually, we're doing much worse than Hitler could ever dream of doing.
[01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:45.771]  I have here a draft I sent Alex a copy of.
[01:47:45.771 --> 01:47:51.392]  I'll tell you what, Butch, cover it when we get back, because I'm going to let Dr. Begich go now, and so you can have the rest of the time to cover this.
[01:47:51.392 --> 01:47:53.273]  Dr. Begich, we'll talk to you again real soon.
[01:47:53.273 --> 01:47:55.333]  Huge 9-11 news just broke.
[01:47:55.333 --> 01:47:55.993]  It's breaking.
[01:47:55.993 --> 01:48:01.995]  Another huge Hollywood power has gone public on 9-11 on national TV today.
[01:48:01.995 --> 01:48:03.755]  We just learned of it.
[01:48:03.755 --> 01:48:05.276]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[01:48:05.276 --> 01:48:06.296]  This is huge.
[01:48:06.296 --> 01:48:07.897]  Dr. Begich, thanks for coming on.
[01:48:07.897 --> 01:48:08.837]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[01:48:08.837 --> 01:48:09.217]  Take care.
[01:48:09.557 --> 01:48:10.058]  You bet.
[01:48:10.058 --> 01:48:11.619]  I mean, this is an exciting day.
[01:48:11.619 --> 01:48:13.922]  It was David Lynch, the huge director, earlier.
[01:48:13.922 --> 01:48:21.569]  Now, we'll cover something just as big on the other side.
[01:48:21.569 --> 01:48:24.012]  Oh, praise God, it's coming out.
[01:48:24.012 --> 01:48:24.492]  Oh, man.
[01:48:27.185 --> 01:48:29.926]  Federal agents!
[01:48:29.926 --> 01:48:30.906]  We are armed!
[01:48:48.591 --> 01:48:50.372]  We're good to go.
[01:49:09.629 --> 01:49:14.030]  I see a message from the government, like every day.
[01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:16.911]  I watch it and listen, and call them all suckers.
[01:49:16.911 --> 01:49:19.231]  They're warning me about Osama or whatever.
[01:49:19.231 --> 01:49:20.952]  Picture me buying this scam.
[01:49:20.952 --> 01:49:22.172]  I said, never.
[01:49:22.172 --> 01:49:24.833]  You in tune to a hard truth soldier spitting.
[01:49:24.833 --> 01:49:27.453]  I stay committed, give or take, as I lose commission.
[01:49:27.453 --> 01:49:30.114]  It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control.
[01:49:30.114 --> 01:49:32.655]  And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul.
[01:49:32.655 --> 01:49:35.435]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[01:49:35.435 --> 01:49:37.636]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and rapes.
[01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:39.476]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:39.476 --> 01:49:44.458]  Pastor Butch Paul is our guest, and I apologize to him because he's bringing us such vital info.
[01:49:44.458 --> 01:49:47.379]  He's been researching this for the last month when he discovered it.
[01:49:47.379 --> 01:49:49.519]  It integrates in with everything we're talking about today.
[01:50:08.437 --> 01:50:12.719]  On The View, huge national broadcast TV show.
[01:50:12.719 --> 01:50:21.984]  James Borden, we've gotten a bunch of emails about this, we're confirming it right now, but it is confirmed he was a guest today, just broke 9-11 truth on a top rated TV show, The View.
[01:50:21.984 --> 01:50:31.069]  At the end of his stint on the program show, he announced to the audience the website 911weknow.com, and I've gone to the site, it exposes a 9-11 inside job.
[01:50:32.686 --> 01:50:40.929]  And so now James Borland, and that's the big Hollywood actor, producer, husband of Barbra Streisand, has gone public.
[01:50:40.929 --> 01:50:44.771]  Earlier today we just discovered that over the weekend on national Dutch television,
[01:50:45.752 --> 01:50:54.014]  Another huge individual, a director and a producer, went public there as well.
[01:50:54.014 --> 01:50:56.575]  We'll tell you more about that before the broadcast ends.
[01:50:56.575 --> 01:50:58.335]  Pastor Butch, this is exciting.
[01:50:58.335 --> 01:51:02.896]  I mean, the evil's coming down on us, but more and more people are having the courage to speak up.
[01:51:02.896 --> 01:51:04.096]  Is it not amazing?
[01:51:04.096 --> 01:51:05.437]  Absolutely.
[01:51:05.437 --> 01:51:09.238]  It's exciting, but a little bit scary, too, because the other side is not going to back up.
[01:51:09.238 --> 01:51:10.898]  I wonder what the next move's going to be.
[01:51:11.676 --> 01:51:12.837]  You know, I want to talk about you personally.
[01:51:12.837 --> 01:51:16.379]  I know you can't talk about a lot of it because it was classified, but I mean, you volunteered for Vietnam.
[01:51:16.379 --> 01:51:23.123]  You were in covert operations in countries around Vietnam.
[01:51:23.123 --> 01:51:23.943]  You did a lot of things.
[01:51:23.943 --> 01:51:28.846]  I mean, back then, I've heard you talk about it, you totally believed patriotism was doing whatever the government said.
[01:51:28.846 --> 01:51:32.528]  What do you say to police and military that are serving the black dragon?
[01:51:32.528 --> 01:51:36.530]  Well, I will say, I didn't volunteer for Vietnam, but yes, I was in Vietnam and communications expert.
[01:51:38.163 --> 01:51:44.592]  I would pray that these people would quit walking blindly behind these leaders and take a look at what's going on.
[01:51:44.592 --> 01:51:50.400]  I know for a fact that when I was there, the CIA was flying in massive amounts of drugs in and out of Vietnam.
[01:51:51.455 --> 01:51:52.236]  They did it.
[01:51:52.236 --> 01:51:56.538]  They stuffed caskets full of drugs, shipped them home to the U.S.
[01:51:56.538 --> 01:51:59.019]  or where they shipped them to as dead soldiers.
[01:51:59.019 --> 01:52:04.001]  And I thought it was okay because I was an American serviceman.
[01:52:04.001 --> 01:52:04.982]  Let's be clear.
[01:52:04.982 --> 01:52:09.524]  You're not just all the other CIA guys we've had on who have admitted or seen the Bushes involved?
[01:52:09.524 --> 01:52:10.785]  No, no.
[01:52:10.785 --> 01:52:12.946]  You were there and knew about this.
[01:52:13.346 --> 01:52:21.368]  I was stationed partly in New Dorn, Thailand, next to the largest airsport base in Southeast Asia at the time.
[01:52:21.368 --> 01:52:23.088]  And these planes flew in and out of there all the time.
[01:52:23.088 --> 01:52:24.529]  I mean, it was no big secret.
[01:52:24.529 --> 01:52:28.610]  I mean, it was like a... You couldn't just have the elephant in the front room.
[01:52:28.610 --> 01:52:29.630]  Everyone knew it was there.
[01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:32.011]  They just ignored it.
[01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:32.951]  It was no big deal.
[01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:36.812]  Everybody thought that we were doing well because we're Americans and we were up to the gooks.
[01:52:36.812 --> 01:52:38.612]  We were up to the bad guys.
[01:52:38.612 --> 01:52:40.513]  Just as we are in Iraq today.
[01:52:40.513 --> 01:52:41.933]  That's why they take children in, Alex.
[01:52:42.472 --> 01:52:45.775]  That's why they take nine-year-old boys in and girls in.
[01:52:45.775 --> 01:52:50.459]  They're naive, and their mom and dad fought in World War II, and they thought they did the right thing back then, too.
[01:52:50.459 --> 01:52:54.122]  So, naivety will destroy you.
[01:52:54.122 --> 01:52:57.345]  Hosea 4-6, my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[01:52:57.345 --> 01:52:58.826]  That's what's happened in this country.
[01:52:58.826 --> 01:53:00.768]  When did you wake up?
[01:53:00.768 --> 01:53:02.970]  About 1991.
[01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:04.511]  What was it, Pastor Butch Paul?
[01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:06.373]  Then we'll go to break and come back and talk about the story.
[01:53:06.373 --> 01:53:08.034]  What woke me up, I guess, was Randy Weaver.
[01:53:10.009 --> 01:53:11.950]  Is that 91, 92, somewhere in that area?
[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:12.410]  Yeah, 92, yeah.
[01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:13.310]  Yeah.
[01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:22.233]  That's when I started questioning what was going on, and looking behind the scenes, and my gosh, the deeper I dug, the more it stunk.
[01:53:22.233 --> 01:53:29.055]  And I realize now how deceived I was, and I apologize to many people because of the deception I was involved in, but I did it eagerly.
[01:53:29.055 --> 01:53:32.176]  Now I'm trying to turn around and do something righteously.
[01:53:32.176 --> 01:53:33.976]  Well, that's absolutely.
[01:53:33.976 --> 01:53:38.858]  So you guys knew about the government dealing drugs, but it was just kind of like, well, we're the good guys, there must be a good reason for it.
[01:53:38.858 --> 01:53:39.178]  Absolutely.
[01:53:40.188 --> 01:53:41.749]  We trusted our government.
[01:53:41.749 --> 01:53:47.471]  One thing our forefathers warned us about, and so does the scriptures, many times, never puts trust in man.
[01:53:47.471 --> 01:53:55.075]  Jeremiah 17, verse 5 said, Cursed be the man that puts trust in man and makes place in his arm, his strength.
[01:53:55.075 --> 01:54:01.038]  We've cursed ourselves through our ignorance and empathy with following man's and man's laws, ignoring God's laws.
[01:54:01.619 --> 01:54:18.736]  Okay, let's get into this experimentation where they trick the parents when they sign up for security procedures with the retina scans and thumb scans to get your kids, happening right here in Austin now, or in a suburb, and you're really signing them up for human experimentation.
[01:54:18.736 --> 01:54:20.118]  We're on the march.
[01:54:20.118 --> 01:54:22.660]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:54:22.660 --> 01:54:25.343]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:52.922 --> 01:55:04.729]  I wish that I could fly, into the sky, so very high, just like a dragonfly.
[01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:12.594]  I'd fly above the trees, over the sea, in all degrees, to anywhere I please.
[01:55:12.594 --> 01:55:13.814]  Oh, I want to
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:21.461]  Welcome back.
[01:55:21.461 --> 01:55:22.541]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:25.844]  This is the InfoWar on the front lines.
[01:55:25.844 --> 01:55:31.468]  Just like Paris was saying in the last segment, it's a battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[01:55:31.468 --> 01:55:36.471]  The enemies of God and free humans traffic in the souls of men.
[01:55:36.471 --> 01:55:37.412]  They brainwash you.
[01:55:37.412 --> 01:55:39.393]  They destroy your destiny.
[01:55:39.393 --> 01:55:40.594]  They control your life.
[01:55:40.594 --> 01:55:42.235]  They make you petty, mindless creatures.
[01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:45.671]  Uh, who only, uh, you know, lust after the things of the world.
[01:55:45.671 --> 01:55:48.793]  They take everything away from you, all of God's gifts.
[01:55:48.793 --> 01:55:55.777]  My friends, we are under attack, and we rise to the challenge with God's help to fight this new world order.
[01:55:55.777 --> 01:55:57.818]  Now, David Lynch has spoken out on 9-11.
[01:55:57.818 --> 01:55:59.939]  In fact, get that queued up.
[01:55:59.939 --> 01:56:03.241]  I want to play that before this segment ends and get Butch's take on it.
[01:56:03.241 --> 01:56:10.705]  Saying there are many questions, no answers on 9-11, bringing up how the buildings fell, the hole at the Pentagon, and saying that the government could be involved in it.
[01:56:12.586 --> 01:56:15.969]  This aired just three days ago, Sunday, on Dutch television.
[01:56:15.969 --> 01:56:20.032]  We just learned of it earlier today, and then now, I'm cleaning all the calls out.
[01:56:20.032 --> 01:56:21.933]  We haven't taken a lot of calls today.
[01:56:21.933 --> 01:56:24.735]  We will only take your call if you saw The View this morning.
[01:56:24.735 --> 01:56:26.056]  We've gotten a bunch of emails on this.
[01:56:26.056 --> 01:56:27.377]  We've confirmed he was on the show.
[01:56:27.377 --> 01:56:29.199]  We're trying to confirm he did say this.
[01:56:29.199 --> 01:56:31.000]  We're trying to get an audio clip of it.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:35.224]  James Brolin just broke 9-11 truth on the top-rated TV show, The View.
[01:56:35.224 --> 01:56:41.829]  At the end of his stint this morning's show, he announced to the audience that the website 911weknow.com.
[01:56:41.829 --> 01:56:42.169]  Thank you.
[01:56:43.064 --> 01:56:45.485]  That is massive right there.
[01:56:45.485 --> 01:56:46.746]  So it looks like the dam is breaking.
[01:56:46.746 --> 01:56:49.788]  We have to confirm that.
[01:56:49.788 --> 01:56:52.909]  Again, Charlie Sheen hit the barbed wire first.
[01:56:52.909 --> 01:56:54.310]  Incredible courage.
[01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:58.872]  He was told to basically shut up and then they dropped all those lies on him after that.
[01:56:58.872 --> 01:56:59.993]  Just amazing courage.
[01:57:01.505 --> 01:57:05.248]  He hit the bar bar first in that whole guild of people.
[01:57:05.248 --> 01:57:21.919]  I mean, obviously there are former German defense ministers and former members of Congress and members of Congress and all these high-level people, you know, the head economist for the Department of Labor going public, and the father of Reaganomics in the Reagan administration, who headed up the Treasury Department, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, going public.
[01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:28.825]  All these CIA people going public here on the show, widows, victims, firemen going public here.
[01:57:28.825 --> 01:57:38.753]  But when you get big Hollywood people now, like Barbra Streisand's husband, who again has produced hundreds of TV shows, scores of movies, it's in the hundreds here.
[01:57:47.605 --> 01:57:50.067]  Of the movies and films he's been in.
[01:57:50.067 --> 01:57:54.049]  And of course, that is James Brolin doing that.
[01:57:54.049 --> 01:57:57.991]  I mean, it is AMAZING!
[01:57:57.991 --> 01:58:01.132]  And before we go back to Butch, I had her schedule.
[01:58:01.132 --> 01:58:03.013]  I appreciate her coming on briefly.
[01:58:03.013 --> 01:58:08.156]  That is Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts, the Made in America water filters.
[01:58:08.156 --> 01:58:10.077]  They also have the British ones if you choose.
[01:58:10.077 --> 01:58:11.578]  They support patriotism.
[01:58:11.578 --> 01:58:13.099]  They support this broadcast.
[01:58:13.099 --> 01:58:14.760]  And this is key!
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:15.260]  This is key!
[01:58:17.685 --> 01:58:22.528]  It's made in America, they support this broadcast, and the water is full of poison, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:28.512]  Stop drinking it, and you get the equivalent of what distributors are getting these for.
[01:58:28.512 --> 01:58:30.474]  These are like $320 in stores.
[01:58:30.474 --> 01:58:31.254]  You get them $195, $199.
[01:58:31.254 --> 01:58:35.817]  If you want the really fancy one with all the bells and whistles, $259.
[01:58:37.879 --> 01:58:39.720]  Just free gifts with it.
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.583]  Sports bottle filters with the big unit.
[01:58:42.583 --> 01:58:43.463]  Takes a few minutes.
[01:58:43.463 --> 01:58:46.166]  Debbie, they're just nuts if they don't call and get this.
[01:58:46.166 --> 01:58:50.009]  They're insane if they don't call and order it for friends and family.
[01:58:50.009 --> 01:58:51.250]  I mean, how many have I bought?
[01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:55.994]  I know it's more than ten over the years just to give as gifts to family.
[01:58:55.994 --> 01:58:58.556]  In fact, just a month ago we gave one to family.
[01:58:58.556 --> 01:58:59.297]  My parents did.
[01:58:59.297 --> 01:59:02.520]  It's just absolutely essential.
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.080]  Debbie, thanks for coming.
[01:59:05.225 --> 01:59:06.686]  Thank you so much for having me.
[01:59:06.686 --> 01:59:06.886]  You bet.
[01:59:06.886 --> 01:59:09.067]  Tell folks about Berkey and tell them how to get it.
[01:59:09.067 --> 01:59:13.509]  Well, you can call us at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:13.509 --> 01:59:16.030]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:30.097]  Or they can go to our website at www.berkeywater.com and it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[01:59:30.097 --> 01:59:32.258]  And we do have a lot of holiday specials
[01:59:33.187 --> 01:59:41.912]  And so please give us a call and ask us what the Alex Jones Holiday Specials are and we'll be glad to answer any questions.
[01:59:41.912 --> 01:59:45.533]  Berkey water filters are gravity-fed water filters.
[01:59:45.533 --> 01:59:47.995]  They don't have to be plumbed in.
[01:59:47.995 --> 01:59:51.296]  You can take them anywhere and use them in any water situations.
[01:59:51.296 --> 01:59:54.578]  They're for everyday use as well as for
[01:59:55.129 --> 01:59:59.870]  In case of an emergency and you need to use any type of local water.
[01:59:59.870 --> 02:00:07.332]  You are insane if you don't purify your water and that doesn't mean some cheap charcoal thing that just takes out some of the dead bacteria and the bad flavor.
[02:00:07.332 --> 02:00:09.212]  This is to non-detectable levels.
[02:00:09.212 --> 02:00:15.594]  With electron microscopes they can't find bacteria or what normally would show up in other filters, even their excrement.
[02:00:16.114 --> 02:00:19.718]  This is unprecedented, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:19.718 --> 02:00:32.331]  You need to give them a call, 888-803-4438, 888-803-4438, or order via InfoWars.com or BerkeyWater.com, and tell us what free gift you want in the comment section.
[02:00:32.331 --> 02:00:35.394]  Potassium iodide to protect when there's a radiological event.
[02:00:35.394 --> 02:00:36.315]  You take it at that time.
[02:00:36.315 --> 02:00:37.516]  Your pets can take it, your children.
[02:00:38.537 --> 02:00:42.179]  This is the medical core type that's recommended so it doesn't make you upchuck it.
[02:00:42.179 --> 02:00:43.460]  The type they give the military.
[02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:44.041]  Doesn't work.
[02:00:44.041 --> 02:00:46.642]  Even a grown man has trouble holding it down if there is an attack.
[02:00:46.642 --> 02:00:49.725]  The portable sports bottles that make the water safe to drink.
[02:00:49.725 --> 02:00:51.806]  Not completely pure like the purifiers.
[02:00:51.806 --> 02:00:52.887]  The larger units.
[02:00:52.887 --> 02:00:53.567]  Give her a call.
[02:00:53.567 --> 02:00:56.149]  888-803-4438.
[02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:57.370]  Debbie, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:00:57.370 --> 02:00:58.791]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:00:58.791 --> 02:00:59.632]  God bless you.
[02:00:59.632 --> 02:01:00.753]  You bet.
[02:01:00.753 --> 02:01:02.094]  Going back to Pastor Butch Paul.
[02:01:03.004 --> 02:01:13.419]  Let's continue with, you discover they make appearance, in some areas they make you, like Westlake here in Austin, outside Austin, richest, you know, area, suburb of Austin.
[02:01:13.419 --> 02:01:14.360]  Thumb scans, retina...
[02:01:38.230 --> 02:01:41.812]  Especially these people that say we should worship government and do whatever it says.
[02:01:41.812 --> 02:01:46.315]  I want you to tell them about that teaching, that video you did, Render Unto Caesar Explained.
[02:01:46.315 --> 02:01:49.136]  But right now, please continue.
[02:01:49.136 --> 02:01:52.298]  I just hope Troy here in Washington doesn't listen to this program today.
[02:01:52.298 --> 02:01:52.938]  Remember Troy?
[02:01:52.938 --> 02:01:56.580]  Yeah, what do you think of him calling in and threatening to quote, beat me up?
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:59.202]  Well, we have some jerks in this state too, I'm afraid.
[02:01:59.202 --> 02:02:01.403]  What's he going to do when he finds out I'm running for governor in this state?
[02:02:01.403 --> 02:02:03.564]  It's going to scare him to death.
[02:02:03.564 --> 02:02:04.985]  But anyway.
[02:02:05.855 --> 02:02:19.063]  In the topics I have here, and I sent some of these to you via fax, in that letter there written by John C. Fletcher, that was not to be quoted or cited without permission, he had to contact some people, a certain number of people to do this, in this letter.
[02:02:19.063 --> 02:02:28.129]  Now, this insults me to know that our children, and us, not just the children, but now adults, are now considered human research subjects.
[02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:31.411]  We're no longer people, actually, we're considered animals.
[02:02:31.411 --> 02:02:35.073]  Nehemiah chapter 9 said that one day they would own our bodies, well now they do.
[02:02:35.791 --> 02:02:46.483]  Back in 1998, President Clinton requested the NBAC to include implications of a reported attempt to fuse a human cell with a cow egg.
[02:02:46.483 --> 02:02:49.347]  Researchers claim an embryonic cell mixed a human and cow.
[02:02:53.271 --> 02:03:02.494]  If such a fusion did result in a chimeric organism that was not a human embryo, then it saw no ethical problems of continued experiments.
[02:03:02.494 --> 02:03:18.520]  Also, from a speech made by a gentleman by the name of Harlan Gerard, back in October 19, 1997, he said this, Now I want to point out that we have an unblemished history of human experimentation, now dating 65 years ago, without relief.
[02:03:19.306 --> 02:03:24.428]  I will tell you, you'll be happy to know, the government is no longer experimenting on the poor and the vulnerable.
[02:03:24.428 --> 02:03:34.153]  It's not experimenting on the nice middle class people like yourselves, psychologists, engineers, social workers, black, white, asian, christians, jews, buddhists, it's an equal opportunity killer.
[02:03:34.153 --> 02:03:39.055]  Now this is from a man who was there and saw this and done this, in fact I'm going to try to contact him as soon as possible.
[02:03:39.295 --> 02:03:41.276]  Now let's be clear though, let me stop you there.
[02:03:41.276 --> 02:03:53.283]  The reason they have to give their minions these documents is the average psychologist or psychiatrist or cops coming to grab you or CPS workers, they've got to be given some signed piece of paper saying doing this is okay.
[02:03:53.283 --> 02:03:56.865]  Okay, so this is just a policy.
[02:03:56.865 --> 02:04:00.426]  Well, a policy doesn't legalize murder or torture.
[02:04:00.426 --> 02:04:08.751]  Well, and on the same document here by John Fletcher it says, morals must be a growing science if it is to be a science at all, not merely because all truth
[02:04:09.082 --> 02:04:09.543]  We're good to go.
[02:04:26.662 --> 02:04:29.784]  And they're saying there's no moral.
[02:04:29.784 --> 02:04:33.666]  They say we're not bad doing this because we decide what's bad.
[02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:35.266]  We're the immoral ones now.
[02:04:35.266 --> 02:04:40.089]  We're the ones crying out to stop this and we're the ones who now are being immoral because we're selfish.
[02:04:40.089 --> 02:04:47.773]  We don't want to do the same because we believe it's wrong to murder and to pillage someone's mind or to destroy their bodies with drugs or whatever.
[02:04:47.773 --> 02:04:48.793]  This is pure evil.
[02:04:48.793 --> 02:04:49.393]  Pure evil.
[02:04:49.393 --> 02:04:50.174]  It's pure evil.
[02:04:50.174 --> 02:04:51.094]  It's absolutely pure evil.
[02:04:51.094 --> 02:04:51.875]  It's hard for you and I.
[02:04:52.595 --> 02:04:57.961]  Somewhat moral people, I guess you could say, to comprehend that people could be this evil, but they are.
[02:04:57.961 --> 02:04:58.962]  They're here.
[02:04:58.962 --> 02:05:05.490]  And why else would John Glenn, who's also an evil man, by the way, introduce a bill to protect human research subjects?
[02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:07.852]  I don't like being a human research subject!
[02:05:07.852 --> 02:05:08.793]  I am a man!
[02:05:08.793 --> 02:05:09.955]  I'm not an animal!
[02:05:09.955 --> 02:05:10.796]  And I don't like it!
[02:05:10.796 --> 02:05:11.797]  I'm not going to tolerate it!
[02:05:12.412 --> 02:05:20.494]  My gosh, Alex, I haven't had a driver's license since 1998 because I won't take a biometric scan and put it on computers to be traced all over the world.
[02:05:20.494 --> 02:05:23.035]  I've been fighting this with the DMV in this state for years.
[02:05:23.035 --> 02:05:25.396]  We made a few inroads in the last few months.
[02:05:25.396 --> 02:05:31.517]  In my teaching, which by the way is on our website, PastorButch.com, Rendering Under Caesar Explained is on there.
[02:05:31.517 --> 02:05:33.318]  They can watch it for free.
[02:05:33.318 --> 02:05:35.438]  Rendering Under Caesar Explained is a three-hour video.
[02:05:35.438 --> 02:05:37.479]  Watch it all on PastorButch.com.
[02:05:37.918 --> 02:05:39.659]  Folks, please watch that.
[02:05:39.659 --> 02:05:41.220]  It can save your soul from hell.
[02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:42.861]  Let me talk about denial here.
[02:05:42.861 --> 02:05:52.507]  We have video of Dick Cheney saying that he was the head of the CFR, the director, and that he didn't tell his constituents, with David Rockefeller laughing.
[02:05:52.507 --> 02:05:56.229]  And then I get emails saying it's not real video, it isn't true.
[02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:57.970]  I mean, these people are delusional!
[02:05:57.970 --> 02:06:02.553]  1994, 95, I was talking about the CFR, Trial and Error Commission, and all the rest of it.
[02:06:02.553 --> 02:06:04.254]  They didn't exist!
[02:06:04.254 --> 02:06:05.054]  No one's ever heard of them!
[02:06:05.054 --> 02:06:05.755]  They're not real!
[02:06:06.448 --> 02:06:11.134]  Now they're out on TV saying, yes, remember CFR, as you said, Cheney said it.
[02:06:11.134 --> 02:06:13.537]  But people still are in denial, Alex.
[02:06:13.537 --> 02:06:20.245]  They don't want to, they just cannot grasp the idea that we have become this evil and so far down the road into tyranny.
[02:06:20.245 --> 02:06:22.388]  And I hope people will watch Renew the Seizure.
[02:06:22.388 --> 02:06:24.050]  I'm not trying to, it's free!
[02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.871]  I'm not trying to sell it.
[02:06:25.185 --> 02:06:29.348]  Yeah, once you get rid of God's standards, it's man's standards, and that's in the toilet.
[02:06:41.182 --> 02:06:43.843]  Total destruction of a society.
[02:06:43.843 --> 02:06:47.824]  And I'm going to say this as a pastor and a preacher, which I am, by the way.
[02:06:47.824 --> 02:06:56.466]  If we, as Christians, the church, do not judge the evil in society, then a righteous God will judge a whole nation and us along with it.
[02:06:56.466 --> 02:06:58.607]  Now that's the way it is.
[02:06:58.607 --> 02:07:07.069]  Continuing with your research, and now again, they tell the parents, oh, it's a program for your kids' safety, sign this form, and really you're signing them into this whole program.
[02:07:07.779 --> 02:07:18.024]  Oh yes, and they finally admitted that this goes... See, in Clarksburg, West Virginia, we have the headquarters for all the biometric information of this whole nation.
[02:07:18.024 --> 02:07:22.225]  Yeah, I remember seeing that six years ago that the biometric database was to be there.
[02:07:22.225 --> 02:07:26.047]  Yes, and it's operating course is three stories underground.
[02:07:26.047 --> 02:07:30.389]  As a matter of fact, I talked to the engineer that helped develop that complex up there.
[02:07:30.389 --> 02:07:32.770]  When I mentioned it's underground, he was shocked that I knew that.
[02:07:33.597 --> 02:07:35.300]  Yeah, how did you know that?
[02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:44.051]  I remember back in like 99 hearing that they were going to build a national base there, a command base to store all the national ID card info.
[02:07:44.051 --> 02:07:49.498]  Yes, it's already here and operating, but now they want me to find out the information from their children and go right into this
[02:07:49.958 --> 02:07:50.478]  I don't know.
[02:08:06.334 --> 02:08:09.376]  That's all, this is all in this material I've got in front of me.
[02:08:09.376 --> 02:08:10.957]  And I'm going to be, it's going to take a while.
[02:08:10.957 --> 02:08:12.118]  I've only got about 30 pages.
[02:08:12.118 --> 02:08:14.140]  I told you not to fax me the whole thousand.
[02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:16.381]  But I do know from the other stuff, they do tissue type.
[02:08:16.381 --> 02:08:22.125]  Take China, where they're taking national DNA databases and they come charge you with a crime when some elitist needs it.
[02:08:22.125 --> 02:08:24.687]  Needs your organs, needs your goods.
[02:08:24.687 --> 02:08:25.628]  Tell us about that part then.
[02:08:26.008 --> 02:08:29.150]  Well, this is a database.
[02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:33.393]  Again, they're not admitting they're going to do this, but they are taking, of course, DNA and other tissue.
[02:08:33.393 --> 02:08:39.057]  But it's run by the West Virginia Institution Review Board of the Protection of Human Research Subjects.
[02:08:39.057 --> 02:08:40.758]  Yeah, that's from the West Virginia University.
[02:08:41.398 --> 02:08:44.179]  Uh, Institute for the Protection of Human Research Subjects, yes.
[02:08:44.179 --> 02:08:51.262]  And this, I read, I discussed in our Bible studies over two years ago... And you know why so much of this happens in Texas and Arkansas and West Virginia?
[02:08:51.262 --> 02:08:53.643]  Because they think we're a bunch of dumb hillbillies.
[02:08:53.643 --> 02:08:55.424]  Well, Joy can approve that.
[02:08:55.424 --> 02:09:04.248]  But anyway... But as I read this I become angry, I become frustrated, and I become very agitated.
[02:09:04.801 --> 02:09:08.342]  Because I see this happening and the masses, again, are in denial.
[02:09:08.342 --> 02:09:11.843]  Thank God some people are now seeing that 9-1-1 was an inside job.
[02:09:11.843 --> 02:09:21.326]  As you mentioned, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
[02:09:29.721 --> 02:09:31.902]  Well, we're going to break out and break this thing down.
[02:09:31.902 --> 02:09:33.763]  One of the other things, there can't be an in-between ground here.
[02:09:33.763 --> 02:09:39.666]  And that's one of the biggest problems is, when Hitler was doing what he was doing, the churches said, lay down, he's the Antichrist, don't fight.
[02:09:39.666 --> 02:09:40.186]  Yes.
[02:09:40.186 --> 02:09:43.168]  Whenever Nero was doing stuff, they said, lay down, he's the Antichrist.
[02:09:43.168 --> 02:09:44.548]  No, that's a lie!
[02:09:44.548 --> 02:09:47.570]  They told the Founding Fathers, lay down, you know, the British are the devil.
[02:09:47.570 --> 02:09:50.191]  No, you're to fight evil regardless.
[02:09:50.191 --> 02:09:55.494]  If we do not fight evil, we are partakers of that evil and also conceding to that evil.
[02:09:55.894 --> 02:09:59.235]  And that absolutely is something that Christians must learn.
[02:09:59.235 --> 02:10:03.016]  I've gotten in a lot of flack over the years because I've preached this and teach this.
[02:10:03.016 --> 02:10:05.197]  We are put here on earth not to save souls.
[02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:06.397]  Now that's going to make a lot of people.
[02:10:06.397 --> 02:10:07.598]  It's going to shock them.
[02:10:07.598 --> 02:10:09.858]  You're not finding we're in a Bible where the church is to save souls.
[02:10:09.858 --> 02:10:13.619]  We're here according to Matthew 28 in the Great Commission to go out and disciple.
[02:10:13.619 --> 02:10:15.280]  That means discipline the nations.
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.221]  Teach them the laws of the Almighty God.
[02:10:17.221 --> 02:10:20.061]  Because once they know the laws, they know that they need a Savior.
[02:10:20.061 --> 02:10:21.782]  Until then, they don't know that they're even sinners.
[02:10:22.236 --> 02:10:29.820]  We're not here to save, we're here to discipline, to teach the laws of God, and see that His laws are the ones that are in power.
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:36.143]  Well, I've found if you show somebody how evil the New World Order is, they get religion real fast.
[02:10:36.143 --> 02:10:36.863]  Absolutely!
[02:10:36.863 --> 02:10:38.664]  That's the whole job of the church.
[02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:41.605]  Most pastors won't touch what I do, they're scared to death of this.
[02:10:43.346 --> 02:10:46.470]  Well, here's an example.
[02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:51.355]  People tell their kids not to smoke because they're not old enough and it's too much fun, then they go out and smoke.
[02:10:51.355 --> 02:10:59.203]  If you explain to your children that it's there to destroy them, that the government's against them, that the system is there to trap them, they will then listen to you.
[02:10:59.203 --> 02:10:59.984]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:59.984 --> 02:11:03.888]  And again, that's a pastor's job, but we have very few real pastors in America today, Alex.
[02:11:04.212 --> 02:11:12.434]  We have a lot of pulpit pimps, painted-waisted pulpit prostitutes that are paid a good salary to keep their mouths shut in their tax-exempt status, following C3 churches.
[02:11:12.434 --> 02:11:13.474]  We're not speaking out there.
[02:11:13.474 --> 02:11:14.295]  They're cowards.
[02:11:14.295 --> 02:11:16.255]  They're moral, corrupt cowards.
[02:11:16.255 --> 02:11:17.495]  Pat Robertson is one of them.
[02:11:17.495 --> 02:11:19.176]  We go on from Benny Hinn, a whole bunch of them.
[02:11:19.176 --> 02:11:20.316]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:11:20.316 --> 02:11:20.596]  Stay there.
[02:11:20.596 --> 02:11:21.637]  We've got them right when we come back.
[02:11:21.637 --> 02:11:22.337]  Final segment.
[02:11:22.337 --> 02:11:26.398]  I want to plug your numbers, your ministry, let folks know how to listen to you tonight from 8 to 9 Central.
[02:11:27.857 --> 02:11:32.999]  And we will recap all this and I'll talk a little bit about 9-11 and the top stories.
[02:11:32.999 --> 02:11:36.240]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com is the website.
[02:11:45.983 --> 02:11:51.725]  With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too.
[02:11:51.725 --> 02:11:57.466]  They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold.
[02:11:57.466 --> 02:12:07.529]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[02:12:08.869 --> 02:12:12.251]  Do you think it's convincing, what they tell in the film?
[02:12:12.251 --> 02:12:13.011]  It's not so much...
[02:12:38.374 --> 02:12:50.800]  Um, what they say, um, it's the things that, you know, um, make you look at what you thought you saw in a different light.
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:59.384]  And those things for me, um, that bother me, um, is the hole in the Pentagon being too small for a plane.
[02:12:59.384 --> 02:13:06.047]  The lawn isn't messed up and the government's not showing the plane hitting when many cameras photographed it.
[02:13:07.387 --> 02:13:08.488]  at the World Trade Center.
[02:13:31.052 --> 02:13:41.236]  Confirming, but it looks like it's accurate that James Brolin, huge himself, also put out a 9-11 truth site this morning when he was hosting The View on national television.
[02:13:41.236 --> 02:13:42.737]  Butch, it's exciting!
[02:13:42.737 --> 02:13:43.477]  Yes it is, sir.
[02:13:43.477 --> 02:13:44.878]  I'm glad to be in the battle.
[02:13:44.878 --> 02:13:48.599]  I know for a fact that we were not born in our time-basting.
[02:13:48.599 --> 02:13:50.340]  Our Creator had us here for a purpose.
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.600]  I think we're fulfilling His purpose.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.401]  I intend to fight this battle until I die.
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:58.541]  I'll tell you, the old devil fights dirty, though, with all this mind control and propaganda.
[02:13:58.541 --> 02:13:59.762]  It's unbelievable.
[02:13:59.762 --> 02:14:03.483]  The only protection we have is the Holy Spirit in us.
[02:14:03.483 --> 02:14:05.843]  If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't survive five minutes.
[02:14:05.843 --> 02:14:08.824]  As Dick Vedick said in his book, the mind has no firewalls.
[02:14:08.824 --> 02:14:11.765]  Well, the only firewall we have around us is the protection of the Holy God.
[02:14:11.765 --> 02:14:12.685]  And that's where I stand.
[02:14:12.685 --> 02:14:14.006]  That's where I'm going to stand until I'm dead.
[02:14:14.006 --> 02:14:17.827]  And I know I'm not going out of this world until my time is up, and I'm going to battle until I do leave this world.
[02:14:19.369 --> 02:14:20.210]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:20.210 --> 02:14:21.610]  It is unbelievable.
[02:14:21.610 --> 02:14:22.991]  Give out your phone number and show them.
[02:14:22.991 --> 02:14:23.492]  Sure.
[02:14:23.492 --> 02:14:29.936]  People can contact us to call to decision at 800-777-4403.
[02:14:29.936 --> 02:14:33.418]  That's 800-777-4403.
[02:14:33.418 --> 02:14:35.660]  Website pastrabutch.com.

[02:14:48.944 --> 02:14:50.345]  every night.

[02:14:51.486 --> 02:14:53.948]  And again, we're here to help people with anything they need.
[02:14:53.948 --> 02:14:57.291]  If they'll just call 800-777-4403.
[02:14:57.291 --> 02:14:59.112]  We offer our news magazine once a month.
[02:14:59.112 --> 02:15:00.053]  We don't charge for it.
[02:15:00.053 --> 02:15:01.254]  We ask for donations.
[02:15:01.254 --> 02:15:01.934]  It's huge.
[02:15:01.934 --> 02:15:03.575]  It's full of information I can share with you today.
[02:15:03.575 --> 02:15:06.798]  Well, Butch, we're out of time, but I want to tell you, I love your spirit.
[02:15:06.798 --> 02:15:09.440]  And I love you and your great wife and everybody.
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.901]  And it was good having you on with us today.
[02:15:10.901 --> 02:15:11.541]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:15:11.541 --> 02:15:13.563]  Give that number out quickly, because you said it so fast.
[02:15:14.464 --> 02:15:16.126]  Phone number is 800-777-4403.
[02:15:16.126 --> 02:15:18.168]  AndrewButch.com.
[02:15:18.168 --> 02:15:20.671]  Alright, we're out of time.
[02:15:20.671 --> 02:15:21.152]  Salute you.
[02:15:21.152 --> 02:15:21.933]  Keep it up.
[02:15:21.933 --> 02:15:24.095]  Will you write some report up on this for us?
[02:15:24.095 --> 02:15:24.976]  I certainly will.
[02:15:24.976 --> 02:15:29.001]  If you write it, we'll publish it and get it out to people about this.
[02:15:29.001 --> 02:15:30.222]  Just one more thing.
[02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:32.385]  There's so much evil I can't even cover it all anymore, folks.
[02:15:32.385 --> 02:15:33.847]  I'm just wallowing in it.
[02:15:34.307 --> 02:15:37.390]  And then there's so many victories we're having and so many stories I want to break.
[02:15:37.390 --> 02:15:38.932]  I mean, we're just on fire.
[02:15:38.932 --> 02:15:40.774]  We'll see you back tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:15:40.774 --> 02:15:42.075]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:15:42.075 --> 02:15:43.577]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:15:43.577 --> 02:15:47.721]  God bless you all!
