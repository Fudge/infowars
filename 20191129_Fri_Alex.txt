[00:00.000 --> 00:28.160]  It is Friday the 29th day of November 2019. I am your host Alex Jones live from the road.
[00:28.160 --> 00:46.360]  In her short political career Ilhan Omar has juggled campaign finance violations, the
[00:46.360 --> 00:52.120]  defrauding of her immigration status and engaging in an affair with a married white male on
[00:52.120 --> 00:58.360]  her staff. The very type of person Omar claims is the scourge of western civilization.
[00:58.360 --> 01:07.040]  Our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually
[01:07.040 --> 01:13.120]  causing most of the deaths within this country. She said that the pro-Israel lobby in the
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.640]  United States is pushing for allegiance to a foreign country. And this is the latest
[01:18.640 --> 01:22.760]  in an ongoing struggle between the Democratic leadership and a small number of freshman
[01:22.760 --> 01:28.840]  Democrats who have been evocable about pushing the party further to the left.
[01:28.840 --> 01:36.760]  Representative Omar embodies a vile, hate-filled, anti-Semitic, anti-Israel bigotry. This is
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.880]  not a time for politics. This is a time for the Democratic leaders and this institution
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.080]  to do the right thing. They should remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
[01:46.080 --> 01:51.200]  They should stand up to her. They should stop empowering her disgusting hatred before it
[01:51.200 --> 01:52.880]  turns into horror.
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.160]  Just when you thought this leader of the socialist left-leaning squad of the Democratic
[01:57.160 --> 02:02.480]  Party couldn't vilify herself any further, court documents from a trial in Florida have
[02:02.480 --> 02:08.400]  dropped jet fuel on that fire. The Jerusalem Post reported the claims came during testimony
[02:08.400 --> 02:13.640]  by Kuwaiti-born Canadian businessman Alan Bender, who was giving evidence in the trial
[02:13.640 --> 02:19.120]  of Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad al-Thani. The Qatari Amir's brother stands accused of ordering
[02:19.120 --> 02:24.400]  his American bodyguard to murder two people and of holding an American citizen hostage.
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.720]  His deposition obtained by Al Arabiya English was authenticated by the attorney for the
[02:29.720 --> 02:32.320]  plaintiffs, according to the publication.
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.600]  The Washington Examiner reported Bender said Qatar's secretary to the Amir for security
[02:37.600 --> 02:44.040]  affairs Mohammed bin Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Masnad told him that the country recruited Ilhan
[02:44.040 --> 02:49.440]  Omar from even way before she thought about becoming a government official. They groomed
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.680]  her and arranged the foundation, the grounds for her to get into politics way before she
[02:54.680 --> 03:00.720]  even showed interest. They convinced her. He alleged that Omar cooperated with Qatar's
[03:00.720 --> 03:05.880]  request and received cash payments. He also claimed that she used her position in the
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.560]  House of Representatives to access sensitive information, which she relayed to Qatar and
[03:11.560 --> 03:15.640]  through them Iran. According to the deposition, Bender further
[03:15.640 --> 03:21.320]  told the court that Omar actively recruited other politicians on behalf of the nation.
[03:21.320 --> 03:27.160]  If it wasn't for our cash, Ilhan Omar would be just another black Somali refugee in America
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.880]  collecting welfare and serving tables on weekends, he claimed. The officials told him. Omar has
[03:32.880 --> 03:38.120]  predictably denied the allegations as her office responded saying since the day she
[03:38.120 --> 03:43.520]  was elected Saudi Arabian trolls and mouthpieces have targeted Omar with misinformation and
[03:43.520 --> 03:47.680]  conspiracy theories. The latest outlandishly absurd story from
[03:47.680 --> 03:53.280]  a Saudi funded media outlet is of course false and only the latest in that trend. The thing
[03:53.280 --> 04:00.600]  that was interesting in the class was every time the professor said okay that he sort of
[04:00.600 --> 04:07.360]  looked like his shoulders went up. He's in command here. Al Qaeda. He's an expert.
[04:07.360 --> 04:13.280]  You don't say America with an intensity. You don't say England with an intensity. You
[04:13.280 --> 04:22.440]  don't say the army with an intensity. But you say these names because you want that
[04:22.440 --> 04:32.600]  word to carry weight. I am not part of all Shabbat. I do not participate. I do not participate
[04:32.600 --> 04:38.000]  in there. Shabbat is young. Unfortunately for Omar, she has already cast herself in
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.400]  this role. She's done everything in her power to present economy crippling Green New Deal
[04:43.400 --> 04:48.640]  socialism. Her latest proposal, a trillion dollars for affordable housing, which in the
[04:48.640 --> 04:54.080]  hands of the liberal left would be used to wreak havoc on what little property rights
[04:54.080 --> 04:58.000]  Americans have. All right folks, full report on infowars.com. We're taking you to London
[04:58.000 --> 05:04.320]  Bridge next. I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell
[05:04.320 --> 05:10.240]  you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball. I could see
[05:10.240 --> 05:14.840]  where the globalists were going. I could see what their in game agenda was, what their
[05:14.840 --> 05:20.960]  goal was. And I knew that when they were setting a sub PD platform that they were really setting
[05:20.960 --> 05:28.800]  the pressure to take everybody off air to silence everyone to ban words and names and
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.920]  information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[05:33.920 --> 05:40.480]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future. It was
[05:40.480 --> 05:46.720]  the model of infowars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need
[05:46.720 --> 05:51.720]  total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed
[05:51.720 --> 05:56.400]  and that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than
[05:56.400 --> 06:17.280]  ever big brother mainstream media government cover ups you want to stop tyranny will so
[06:17.280 --> 06:33.080]  does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Ladies and gentlemen, it
[06:33.080 --> 06:41.600]  is Friday, November 29, 2019. I'm your host Alex Jones coming to you from the road here
[06:41.600 --> 06:49.800]  in San Diego visiting my wife's family. I'll be back in the ATX tonight. Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:49.800 --> 06:56.040]  again, thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide Friday broadcast. It is
[06:56.040 --> 07:02.160]  Black Friday. We have lots of stampeding crowds running over each other already. Lots of women
[07:02.160 --> 07:08.800]  in the jibs battling each other over goodies at Walmart and so much more. Lots of people
[07:08.800 --> 07:13.240]  having to have their butts amputated because of illegal butt injections. It's the total
[07:13.240 --> 07:19.280]  decadence of the Hollywood poison cup that has been turned over. We also have someone
[07:19.280 --> 07:25.240]  screaming Allah Akbar stabbing five people with a reported bomb vests. They're now saying
[07:25.240 --> 07:31.360]  it's fake on the London Bridge, a favorite Islamic attack point. We've been told it's
[07:31.360 --> 07:41.320]  not Islamic and elephants aren't elephants and skies not blue. That's all coming up.
[07:41.320 --> 07:47.080]  And then just some incredible stories out in the open. Former Obama operatives creating
[07:47.080 --> 07:52.640]  fake news sites to help Democrats win election. They admit they're putting out fake stories
[07:52.640 --> 07:58.200]  and that Facebook, Twitter and Google are promoting them. They're proud of what they're
[07:58.200 --> 08:02.840]  doing. Steve Watson article that was up yesterday. I'm going to have reposts to the front page
[08:02.840 --> 08:07.480]  of m4wars.com. It's so incredible. So there you have them admitting that they're lying.
[08:07.480 --> 08:11.560]  Of course, that's what mainstream media already does. They're just getting with the program.
[08:11.560 --> 08:15.800]  Angela Merkel says freedom of speech must be curtailed to keep society free. Paul Joseph
[08:15.800 --> 08:19.120]  Watson is going to be hosting the fourth hour today. She used to be covering that. She actually
[08:19.120 --> 08:25.280]  said that. This is not satire. In a speech, we're going to be playing that coming up.
[08:25.280 --> 08:30.600]  So they're going to lie to us openly. They're going to silence our speech. Then they're
[08:30.600 --> 08:34.960]  going to bully everybody that speaks up against it. Internet crybabies upset NFL quarterback
[08:34.960 --> 08:40.960]  supports Trump. They want him fired for serious discussions of it happening. Meanwhile, teacher
[08:40.960 --> 08:46.680]  who supported drag queen visiting school without parents being told to exchange phone numbers
[08:46.680 --> 08:51.600]  and contact info with the man dressed as a woman wanted to discuss sexuality with their
[08:51.600 --> 08:55.760]  children says that parents don't have a right and that the school is going to do what they
[08:55.760 --> 09:03.520]  want. And the Texas school and the Texas principal support them and say, we're going to have
[09:03.520 --> 09:09.520]  access to your children. So we're going to lie to you. We're going to give you fake news.
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.840]  We're going to silence you. Then we're going to have contact with your children and exchange
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.760]  phone numbers and other information with them. And you're not going to stop jack crab actually
[09:18.760 --> 09:24.000]  says some of you don't know what is best for your kids. Close quote all up on info wars
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.480]  dot com news wars dot com and Paul's amazing site summit dot news. China folds Beijing
[09:32.480 --> 09:39.000]  does nothing after Trump signs Hong Kong bill. That's a big, big deal. That's just some of
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.520]  what's coming up. Meanwhile, this story is so huge. It's hard to believe, but I went
[09:42.520 --> 09:48.120]  and read the whole bill showed it to a lawyer last night and to law enforcement. They said,
[09:48.120 --> 09:55.760]  I'm right at Charlottesville. Any type of defense training with firearms, Krav Mago,
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.000]  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, kickboxing, Tai Chi, firearms instruction, self-defense now terrorism
[10:01.000 --> 10:11.320]  under Virginia proposed law. That's all coming up today. Trump makes surprise visit to Afghanistan
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.160]  trying to end the war. He's attacked by the left for trying to end the war. What a criminal.
[10:16.160 --> 10:21.320]  And so much more coming out today. Joining us though, he'll be hosting the fourth hour
[10:21.320 --> 10:26.400]  is Paul Joseph Watson, who is in London to give us the latest London Bridge terror stabbing
[10:26.400 --> 10:31.960]  suspect shot dead by police was wearing hoax bomb Euro news. Guardian London Bridge police
[10:31.960 --> 10:38.000]  shoot stabbing suspect after five injured. And of course, last time the lion of London
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.800]  Bridge fought back when they'd already killed a bunch of people. He was taken for reeducation
[10:42.800 --> 10:47.960]  for daring fight back against the jihadis. I'm not joking. Paul, give us the latest
[10:47.960 --> 10:54.600]  information from London stand. Well, good to be back, Alex. Yeah, they
[10:54.600 --> 10:59.600]  are they tackled the man. He stabbed somebody. They're reporting nearby London Bridge. So
[10:59.600 --> 11:05.040]  it sounds like he went into some kind of shop or premises and tried to stab a bunch of people.
[11:05.040 --> 11:09.560]  I've seen one image of a woman that basically looks severely injured or dead. So they're
[11:09.560 --> 11:12.880]  not saying how many people have been stabbed. They're just saying injuries at the moment.
[11:12.880 --> 11:18.880]  So it looks like he then ran onto the bridge and was immediately tackled by a bunch of
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.920]  brave citizens who grabbed the knife from him. And he was wearing what they now call
[11:23.920 --> 11:28.320]  a fake explosives vest. They wouldn't have known that it was fake at the time, obviously.
[11:28.320 --> 11:32.760]  So they got the knife off him, then the police arrived, got the public to stand back and
[11:32.760 --> 11:38.800]  basically double tapped him in the head and shot him dead, which has caused some consternation
[11:38.800 --> 11:43.440]  over quite a few people on Twitter, Alex, who said that the terrorists should not have
[11:43.440 --> 11:49.920]  been killed and that he should have been arrested or handcuffed. Given that he just stabbed,
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.240]  they're saying I guess at least five people at the moment. He was wearing a fake explosives
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.400]  vest. They're saying he should have been arrested, apprehended without deadly force, which is
[11:59.400 --> 12:05.240]  interesting because we've got an election coming up here in about 10 days time where
[12:05.240 --> 12:09.520]  the leader of one side of the parties that are running the two major parties, Jeremy
[12:09.520 --> 12:15.680]  Corbyn of the Labour Party, also said back, I think it was last month, correct, when Baghdadi
[12:15.680 --> 12:21.480]  was killed, that Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, should not have been killed and should have
[12:21.480 --> 12:26.320]  been arrested. So that kind of rhetoric is now being mirrored in the aftermath of this
[12:26.320 --> 12:30.880]  terrorist attack in London. What was the exact term? They called him what an austere scholar,
[12:30.880 --> 12:36.320]  a great leader. Oh, yeah. Immediately after he was killed, the Washington Post reported
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.480]  that he was an austere scholar. I guess we've had the death of another austere scholar on
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.040]  London Bridge today. But here's an example of some of what I picked up on Twitter. These
[12:45.040 --> 12:50.320]  people are all Jeremy Corbyn supporters, obviously. One person said, well done to the public and
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.440]  the police on the fast response on London Bridge. But was there any need for the police
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.960]  to kill the man? They could have easily arrested him, but murdered him instead. State murder
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.680]  doesn't sit well with me. Again, he'd literally just been running around foaming at the mouth.
[13:05.680 --> 13:10.320]  We don't know if he was chanting Alarakbar yet, but it's distinct possibility. He'd
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.840]  ran into premises, police rushed to the scene, passes by, grabbed the man, pinned him to
[13:15.840 --> 13:20.320]  the ground. He had a giant, what they call, zombie knife. But no, he shouldn't have been
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.800]  shot apparently, Alex. That was too much deadly force and he should have merely been
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.440]  arrested. So this is the narrative that we're dealing with. The other aspect of this is
[13:29.440 --> 13:36.000]  as you said, the guy, the guy who tackled the London Bridge terrorists on the previous
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.560]  attack, which was more deadly two years ago, he was later put in a right wing extremist
[13:40.560 --> 13:47.440]  database. So you have that tie in as well. You also also sent to reeducation classes.
[13:47.440 --> 13:53.080]  And again, how many people died? How many times was he brutally stabs? He took on the
[13:53.080 --> 13:57.320]  two individuals with huge knives that were running around stabbing people screaming
[13:57.320 --> 14:01.280]  Alarakbar. And again, we have the footage. The man is going for a suicide vest. They
[14:01.280 --> 14:05.240]  didn't know what it was. They told him over and over again to stop. You see the officer
[14:05.240 --> 14:09.640]  get in the position and killing should have shot him before that when he had his hands
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.520]  on what looked like a suicide vest was saying he was going to detonate it. Obviously wanted
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.960]  suicide by cop had just reportedly stabbed a bunch of people. What the hell planet are
[14:18.960 --> 14:23.800]  these leftist living on, lionizing people like this comeback?
[14:23.800 --> 14:29.680]  Well, we had after the previous attack, which was more deadly. I think it was 11 people
[14:29.680 --> 14:35.320]  killed dozens injured. The lion of Millwall, the guy who tackle one of the terrorists stabbed
[14:35.320 --> 14:40.600]  himself multiple times. And in fact, during that incident, while the terrorists were rushing
[14:40.600 --> 14:45.360]  into the restaurants and attacking people, some people who are hiding in the back were
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.880]  offended that other people were calling these individuals Muslims. And while the attack
[14:50.880 --> 14:55.200]  was taking place, we're screaming out how dare you call them Muslims. There's literally
[14:55.200 --> 14:59.920]  a video of that. But then after that attack, the London Metropolitan Police, who've done
[14:59.920 --> 15:04.520]  an astounding job in this instance, came out and you've seen this in America with school
[15:04.520 --> 15:08.880]  shootings and said, in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack while it's happening,
[15:08.880 --> 15:15.360]  the public should run, hide and tell. That's the advice they gave them. I'm thankful and
[15:15.360 --> 15:19.560]  I'm sure a lot of people who may have been caught up in this today are thankful that
[15:19.560 --> 15:24.000]  those people on London Bridge didn't follow that advice. They didn't run away. They didn't
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.360]  hide. They thought they cackled and they fought. And thanks to that, the terrorist is dead
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.160]  and the casualty list is thankfully quite low. That's right. Or he would have found
[15:34.160 --> 15:37.800]  women and children and taken his time. I want to do five more minutes with you on the other
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.720]  side and then let you get ready. So he really prepared for when you host an hour. Paul Watson
[15:41.720 --> 15:46.200]  is hosting the fourth hour today. I want to come back and ask him some other geopolitical
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.720]  questions and Merkel openly saying we have to take people's speech to protect freedom,
[15:51.720 --> 15:55.480]  freedom for the Islamic globalist invasion of Europe. We'll talk about it all with Paul
[15:55.480 --> 15:58.280]  Joseph Watson. Stay with us.

[17:52.400 --> 18:07.360]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars, the family of listeners and viewers that without
[18:07.360 --> 18:11.560]  you we won't be on the air. And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think
[18:11.560 --> 18:15.520]  you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for
[18:15.520 --> 18:19.560]  the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres. But something I should spend
[18:19.560 --> 18:26.080]  more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing. You've got that
[18:26.080 --> 18:29.800]  pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.200]  filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you
[18:35.200 --> 18:41.360]  can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's
[18:41.360 --> 18:49.160]  not a burden to support InfoWars. It really is something that is good for everybody that

[19:58.440 --> 20:12.520]  infowarsstore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:12.520 --> 20:19.680]  One war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info
[20:19.680 --> 20:32.400]  war. We are back live broadcasting worldwide. Paul Joseph Watson is in London. He'll be
[20:32.400 --> 20:36.640]  hosting the fourth hour today. I know I'm going to be listening always one of the most
[20:36.640 --> 20:42.240]  powerful hours of radio and TV. You're going to listen or see anywhere. I want to hit a
[20:42.240 --> 20:46.280]  few other subjects briefly with Paul here. Then I'll tell you about the other guests
[20:46.280 --> 20:53.640]  and what's coming up today. It's unprecedented to have Merkel come out and say, we've got
[20:53.640 --> 21:01.160]  to restrict speech for freedom. That is true 1984. And that ties in with the Democrats
[21:01.160 --> 21:03.920]  just being honest about what they've been doing all along. We've seen articles in The
[21:03.920 --> 21:08.800]  New York Times, Washington Post, countless others saying the Republicans lie so well.
[21:08.800 --> 21:14.040]  The right wingers lie so well. Alex Jones lies so well, which isn't true. I tell the
[21:14.040 --> 21:19.720]  truth so well, that we've got to start lying better than they do. They have big articles
[21:19.720 --> 21:28.400]  with Charlie Wurzel and others talking about how they're going to be deceptive in The New
[21:28.400 --> 21:33.640]  York Times. It's simply amazing how they're getting their own people to be recruited to
[21:33.640 --> 21:39.200]  be liars in the name of fighting bad guys. Former Obama operatives creating fake news
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.360]  sites to help Democrats win election. It's the info wars.com article and Steve Watson
[21:43.360 --> 21:47.880]  has all of it saved. It's all public. The fake news they're putting out, promoted by
[21:47.880 --> 21:53.480]  Facebook, promoted by Twitter, promoted by Google. Then we put out videos showing Obama
[21:53.480 --> 21:58.920]  saying build a wall five years ago. That's blocked as fake news, even though it's real.
[21:58.920 --> 22:03.720]  So they're putting out fake news while they silence us. And then while they bully and
[22:03.720 --> 22:09.600]  call for the firing of a quarterback that supports Trump four years ago. And while they say that
[22:09.600 --> 22:14.800]  our children belong to them, it's simply incredible. Let's go to a clip of Merkel and then get Paul
[22:14.800 --> 22:40.480]  Joseph Watson's take on this. There you go. But freedom of speech expression has limits.
[22:40.480 --> 22:45.840]  Those limits begin where hatred is spread. Oh, they begin when the dignity of other people
[22:45.840 --> 22:53.040]  is violated. The house must oppose extreme speech. Otherwise, our society will no longer
[22:53.040 --> 22:59.400]  be the free society that it was. Wow. So you have all lived to see the leader of the most
[22:59.400 --> 23:03.800]  powerful nation in Europe, Merkel, who can never be removed from power because they have
[23:03.800 --> 23:08.840]  a parliament, dozens of parties or the 25 big parties. So she always just buys off the other
[23:08.840 --> 23:13.360]  little parties every time she loses an election to stay in power and parliament. That's how
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.120]  that works. One reason the two party system is terrible, but better than a 10 party system,
[23:18.120 --> 23:22.560]  20 party system. Paul Watson, this is simply incredible. They define whatever they want
[23:22.560 --> 23:28.960]  is hate in Europe, in the UK, then they ban it. Now that's actually happening here with
[23:28.960 --> 23:33.960]  the ADL, Southern Barbara Law Center and others saying arrest big tech ads and totally silence
[23:33.960 --> 23:38.400]  all of us. This isn't coming. This is here. What do you see happening next? How do we
[23:38.400 --> 23:45.280]  combat this? Well, of course, with Germany, Alex, they've literally got a constitution
[23:45.280 --> 23:50.640]  which says, quote, there shall be no censorship. They lived under the Gestapo. They lived under
[23:50.640 --> 23:55.720]  the Stasi. They're supposed to have one of the most, you know, liberal, classically liberal
[23:55.720 --> 24:01.120]  constitutions when it comes to free speech imaginable. In fact, Merkel herself back in
[24:01.120 --> 24:08.120]  2010 said multiculturalism has failed. Now she says any speech that offends the dignity
[24:08.120 --> 24:13.960]  of somebody is hate speech. I'm wondering if what she herself said back in 2010 would
[24:13.960 --> 24:19.320]  now be considered hate speech in Germany. And listen, they tried to pass laws in Germany
[24:19.320 --> 24:25.320]  just a couple of months ago where it would make insulting the EU anthem. Yes, the EU
[24:25.320 --> 24:32.040]  actually has an anthem and burning the EU flag a crime punishable up to three years
[24:32.040 --> 24:39.040]  in prison. So this is the situation in Germany. You had also, of course, back in 2015, New
[24:39.040 --> 24:45.440]  Year's Eve 2015, the mass molestation of women in cologne primarily carried out by migrants
[24:45.440 --> 24:50.360]  from North Africa and the Middle East. People who have spoken out about that, including
[24:50.360 --> 24:56.520]  AFD members of parliament who have tweeted about that have had their tweets deleted.
[24:56.520 --> 25:02.280]  People have been arrested interrogated for hate speech for questioning that. In fact,
[25:02.280 --> 25:08.480]  in this article, Alex, which you just cited today, my video, which is called the mass
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.600]  brainwashing of Germany, which talks about how not only through police action, but also
[25:13.600 --> 25:19.680]  through, for example, inserting storylines into soap operas and putting out commercials
[25:19.680 --> 25:26.360]  with German women wearing hijabs and Islamic gobs. There was an effort to kind of make
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.280]  people accept it and stop complaining about it as they let in over a million migrants
[25:30.280 --> 25:35.680]  from the Middle East from these cultures. That video is banned in Germany. You can't
[25:35.680 --> 25:42.200]  even watch it in Germany. And the amount of times I've had messages from Twitter and Facebook
[25:42.200 --> 25:48.000]  when I was on Facebook saying this tweet is illegal in Germany and nobody in Germany can
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.440]  see it. So from going from there shall be no censorship. They are probably just behind
[25:54.440 --> 25:59.120]  Sweden, one of the most censored countries in Europe. And it's absolutely chilling given
[25:59.120 --> 26:01.480]  their history.
[26:01.480 --> 26:07.520]  And we know what's happened. The ADL and other international organizations are setting the
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.600]  standard. They give an awards to Merkel and now they're bringing it to the United States.
[26:12.600 --> 26:18.320]  It's insane to see Sacha Berikoin who made all his money with really absolutely unbelievable
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.400]  stuff trying to set people up for terrorism, saying throw Jews down the well. He'll go
[26:23.400 --> 26:27.120]  okay, well, it's comedy. Well, it's really incitement to violence. We've never done that.
[26:27.120 --> 26:32.840]  I don't dislike Jews. I dislike censors who happen to be Jewish. How should this be countered?
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.000]  I mean, Sacha Berikoin is as close to Hitler as I've seen in my lifetime.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.720]  Well, it should be countered by pointing out that, I mean, he was upset of all things about
[26:44.720 --> 26:49.040]  Mark Zuckerberg saying he supported free speech as if that was a genuine statement in the
[26:49.040 --> 26:53.920]  first place. But that speech has gone far and wide. I'm still hearing about it now.
[26:53.920 --> 27:00.480]  The ironic thing about it, as you said, he actually played characters and made big movies
[27:00.480 --> 27:05.240]  based on characters based on stereotypes, what some people, a lot of people would call
[27:05.240 --> 27:12.240]  racist stereotypes in terms of Borat. And he did another movie called Bruno, which the
[27:12.240 --> 27:19.200]  entire movie was based on a stereotypical gay man. The content of that movie would probably
[27:19.200 --> 27:23.760]  not be shown in cinemas today, because the same kind of woke crowd that he's trying to
[27:23.760 --> 27:30.800]  pander to would find it bigoted and homophobic. So this is this is a guy who's made a career
[27:30.800 --> 27:37.400]  on creating bigoted stereotypes about people in modern day parlance. And now he's trying
[27:37.400 --> 27:42.640]  to say that Facebook and Twitter is allowing extremism on its platform. Of course, their
[27:42.640 --> 27:48.720]  definition of extremism is so entirely vague that it includes anything that basically counters
[27:48.720 --> 27:53.920]  their narrative to the point where you had the ADL respond to that and come out with
[27:53.920 --> 28:00.440]  a list of Twitter personalities and YouTube channels that they demand be banned off the
[28:00.440 --> 28:04.680]  back of this Sasha Baron Cohen speech. And again, it has nothing to do with stopping
[28:04.680 --> 28:11.720]  actual extremism. Some of these organizations have actually incited extremism and incited
[28:11.720 --> 28:17.560]  shootings with this propaganda against Chris Southern, probably also. Yeah, as PLC, where
[28:17.560 --> 28:22.080]  they actually incited a guy to go out and try to shoot up the place. So that I cut a
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.800]  video saying pro Jews down the well, I get arrested. That's incitement to violence. He
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.120]  does it. It's OK because he's Hollywood. No, it's sick. It's dangerous. What are you going
[28:30.120 --> 28:35.400]  to be covering in the fourth hour today? We're going to be covering Greta Thunberg
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.800]  is now part of a religious course in Sweden, again, proving that climate change is religion
[28:40.800 --> 28:46.400]  and all the latest from the London terror attack. All right, summit dot news. Spread

[31:56.480 --> 31:59.960]  wars store dot com. Fear of missing out is a serious condition. It can only be treated
[31:59.960 --> 32:06.040]  in the info wars store dot com. Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going
[32:06.040 --> 32:10.520]  to confiscate all your semiautomatic rifles and he got all the other democrats on the
[32:10.520 --> 32:16.800]  stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero. Think about that. Now those democrats
[32:16.800 --> 32:21.480]  have taken all the guns in the cities they control. Their blue cities are literal crap
[32:21.480 --> 32:28.200]  holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent
[32:28.200 --> 32:33.800]  crime. They know what they're doing. And now the supreme courts come out and ruled that
[32:33.800 --> 32:39.080]  gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[32:39.080 --> 32:43.600]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country's under such incredible attack. But more and
[32:43.600 --> 32:48.560]  more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment and they're going
[32:48.560 --> 32:52.680]  to follow the original bill of rights and constitution and they're not going to help
[32:52.680 --> 32:57.480]  in the confiscation of guns. So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[32:57.480 --> 33:04.360]  Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws. You're listening to the Alex Jones
[33:04.360 --> 33:22.920]  show crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[33:22.920 --> 33:38.720]  front lines of the info. By now it has become crystal clear to everyone that our worst most
[33:38.720 --> 33:43.560]  frightening analysis of the globalist and who they are and what their in game is was
[33:43.560 --> 33:48.960]  in fact completely true, except it was far worse than we even thought. So I have to apologize
[33:48.960 --> 33:55.560]  to listeners and viewers that we really steered you wrong the last 25 years, that things were
[33:55.560 --> 34:03.880]  far worse than we even thought. And if anything, we held back. We held back because it just
[34:03.880 --> 34:13.520]  sounded too fantastical. And if we do lose, if we do end up losing, that's a big reason
[34:13.520 --> 34:20.400]  why because we held back. You see, when you're faced with absolute pure evil and it admits
[34:20.400 --> 34:27.440]  it's evil, and then you think it's going to sound crazy if you tell people, you begin
[34:27.440 --> 34:33.520]  almost aiding the evil by not being completely honest and truthful about what we're facing
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.000]  and what we're dealing with because you want to be comfortable at the dinner table with
[34:37.000 --> 34:42.480]  your family at Thanksgiving because you don't want to ruffle any feathers. You then create
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.480]  a climate where the globalists can come in and bully and dominate and control and get
[34:47.480 --> 34:54.880]  whatever they want done. Now I want to be clear. I am not lecturing this amazing audience
[34:54.880 --> 35:01.320]  who are not an audience who are warriors and brothers and sisters in awakening and in fighting
[35:01.320 --> 35:08.200]  tyranny and in really having a true desire, a spirit, a will that wants to see justice
[35:08.200 --> 35:13.920]  and freedom into the future. That's really what this comes down to. And I cannot praise
[35:13.920 --> 35:19.560]  you enough. Just the fact that you're conscious. Just the fact that you have a connection to
[35:19.560 --> 35:25.760]  God. Just the fact that you know God's real. Just the fact that you love God. That itself
[35:25.760 --> 35:31.040]  is the most powerful thing in the universe and everything else flows from that. So I
[35:31.040 --> 35:36.680]  want to say this before I get into all this news. God is in charge of the universe. We
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.520]  have just been given free will. So we've been doing bad things because that's the nature
[35:40.520 --> 35:46.320]  of what babies do. That's what toddlers do. And there are some of us that are conscious
[35:46.320 --> 35:52.200]  of this and who've decided to actively join evil for whatever sick reasons. There's always
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.720]  going to be degeneracy and aberrant behavior in the universe. And Hollywood and the culture
[35:57.720 --> 36:04.080]  teaches that aberrant behavior is sex. That's only one small part of an aberrant sex. Aberrant
[36:04.080 --> 36:09.800]  behavior is being decadent, is being lazy, is knowing the truth and not caring or aiding
[36:09.800 --> 36:17.200]  evil and corruption for temporal physical gain. That really is satanic because it goes
[36:17.200 --> 36:24.160]  against your own common sense. It goes against your own understanding of what's right. It
[36:24.160 --> 36:31.000]  goes against what's good for us to do in the beginning. The wages of sin are death. And
[36:31.000 --> 36:39.560]  we see that. Big studies out that the population of the United States is plummeting. That life
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.800]  expectancy is plummeting. The cancer rates are exploding. The neurological disorder rates
[36:45.800 --> 36:52.840]  are exploding. Well, of course, we don't value the unborn. We don't value the born. We don't
[36:52.840 --> 37:01.880]  value the old. Suicide rates in white males are at stratospheric levels because white
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.000]  males everywhere are told they're worthless, they're bad, they're obsolete. And if men are
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.200]  told they're worthless, they're bad, they're obsolete, they're not needed, they will kill
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.920]  themselves. But I tell the men of the world, whether you're black, whether you're white,
[37:13.920 --> 37:23.640]  whether you're old, whether you're young, your communion with God, your connection to
[37:23.640 --> 37:30.880]  God, and your spiritual energy, your worship is all that matters in this universe. Your
[37:30.880 --> 37:37.440]  spiritual decision to join with God as a free, sentient being that is the seed of the universe.
[37:37.440 --> 37:43.800]  That's real creation. God creates new, sentient, free will beings that have incredible potential
[37:43.800 --> 37:53.200]  made in the image and likeness of God. How heavy is that? And how real is that? The ancients
[37:53.200 --> 37:59.600]  didn't all just recognize this. They knew it and look at what we envision from the microchip
[37:59.600 --> 38:05.320]  to the jet airplane, to the artificial heart, to genetic engineering, to nuclear weapons,
[38:05.320 --> 38:13.760]  to Beethoven, to Metallica, the good, the bad, and the ugly, art, cinema, literature, sex,
[38:13.760 --> 38:23.320]  love between men and women, all of these incredibly transcendent, powerful spiritual communions.
[38:23.320 --> 38:28.880]  And they're the globalists trying to counteract it. They've got people running around on Black
[38:28.880 --> 38:35.120]  Friday everywhere, running over each other, trampling each other, stabbing each other,
[38:35.120 --> 38:43.200]  running in a jib, battling and hitting each other over dollar and a half packages of socks.
[38:43.200 --> 38:48.680]  This isn't the land of the free, the home of the brave. This is a group of people transmuted
[38:48.680 --> 39:00.000]  by demonic alchemy into slugs, transmuted and turned into vassal slaves, believing that
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.080]  they can only get fulfillment through the establishment, only get fulfillment through
[39:06.080 --> 39:11.960]  the lottery ticket, only get fulfillment through the fake big box store church, only get fulfillment
[39:11.960 --> 39:18.560]  by believing in the system, but it's all empty. There's only a hysteria. There's only a mad
[39:18.560 --> 39:28.040]  dashing over the edge of a cliff. There's only the foaming at the mouth, crazed spirit.
[39:28.040 --> 39:33.320]  There's nothing real that builds. There's nothing real that sustains. There's nothing
[39:33.320 --> 39:40.760]  real at the end of it that is pro-human, pro-God, pro-justice. And that's what it comes down
[39:40.760 --> 39:47.040]  to. So I'm going to cover all this news, get to all these clips and more, ladies and gentlemen,
[39:47.040 --> 39:51.240]  after this break that's coming up. Then we have a special guest joining us as well that
[39:51.240 --> 39:55.960]  I'll tell you about at the start of the next segment. But on this Black Friday, I want
[39:55.960 --> 40:01.680]  to challenge the listeners. I want to challenge the viewers. I want to challenge people to
[40:01.680 --> 40:06.640]  understand how fundamental it is when you have that relationship with God, when you
[40:06.640 --> 40:11.720]  open up that channel of free will saying, I want to be in touch with the real Creator,
[40:11.720 --> 40:18.200]  the real Master, God, not the fallen system, not the fallen entities, not all the space
[40:18.200 --> 40:24.680]  junk, but the real deal. That's the most important thing. Then opening channels up to others
[40:24.680 --> 40:28.400]  who are depressed, who are down, who are beaten down by the system that have been told that
[40:28.400 --> 40:34.120]  they're worthless when they're so incredible. And then spreading the word about outlets
[40:34.120 --> 40:39.440]  and institutions that the enemy and the world wants to silence, those are the institutions
[40:39.440 --> 40:46.280]  and the systems that need to be promoted like infowars.com, like newswars.com. And then financially
[40:46.280 --> 40:52.240]  support the broadcast, which is so easy. Everything God gives us, everything that's good, everything
[40:52.240 --> 41:02.000]  that's wholesome is self-generating, self-healing, and is a genesis system. So you notice what
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.280]  funds us is t-shirts that spread the word and that help you meet like-minded people.
[41:09.280 --> 41:14.080]  It's literally a uniform to where your color is proud. It can also get you assaulted, get
[41:14.080 --> 41:21.040]  you attacked. It's powerful to, to, to affiliate with what you stand. The water filters we

[42:17.480 --> 42:22.000]  heightened consciousness, the more you live in those high realms, the quiet place of the
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.240]  most high, the King David talked about, where you can see for trillions of miles and have
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.880]  deep understanding, so great, you almost forget the world you're in, you have to go back into
[42:31.880 --> 42:38.040]  the matrix to save others. That's what these products do. They literally fund our operation
[42:38.040 --> 42:43.880]  itself incredible, but help you regenerate, help you be more focused, help you be more

[42:49.040 --> 42:54.000]  silver, iodine, fortified, and then now the new whitening toothpaste, m4store.com, store
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.720]  white free shipping, it is Black Friday, triple-patreon points, biggest sales ever.
[42:59.720 --> 43:08.640]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.800]  will take humanity to? How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the
[43:13.800 --> 43:23.360]  limit to which other men and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to evil, it
[43:23.360 --> 43:31.560]  is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.040]  or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God, but those very same people
[43:36.040 --> 43:43.120]  have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and
[43:43.120 --> 43:48.040]  what our houses can be like. They just don't want us to have any values so they can run
[43:48.040 --> 43:54.600]  over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University of the US has banned 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[43:54.600 --> 43:59.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them. Black Friday is
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.680]  here and the sales are so numerous there is no way to go over all of them, but let me
[44:04.680 --> 44:12.560]  just give you an example of some of the sales we have running right now. DNA Force Plus,
[44:12.560 --> 44:19.800]  our flagship product, 50% off, free shipping, triple patriot points, that's 15% off on your
[44:19.800 --> 44:25.560]  next order. If you sign up for auto ship additional 10% off on that order, making it a loss leader,
[44:25.560 --> 44:30.600]  but on top of it, I'm offering a free bottle of Brain Force Plus, our number one best selling
[44:30.600 --> 44:36.920]  product so that those of you that haven't tried it can see how it gives you clean focused
[44:36.920 --> 44:42.800]  mental stamina is the term that I use with none of the hangovers. Again, that's just
[44:42.800 --> 44:50.840]  one of the sales going right now, 50% off, free shipping, triple patriot points, free
[44:50.840 --> 44:55.560]  bottle of Brain Force Plus with DNA Force Plus at infowarstore.com. Please take action
[44:55.560 --> 45:03.960]  and fund this operation. infowarstore.com. We have a new product and we got several thousand
[45:03.960 --> 45:07.280]  of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[45:07.280 --> 45:12.640]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game changing toothpaste
[45:12.640 --> 45:17.240]  and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine
[45:17.240 --> 45:23.040]  and fluoride free, the adult or the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates
[45:23.040 --> 45:27.360]  that don't have fillers. People love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the
[45:27.360 --> 45:34.240]  above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also re mineralizes the teeth. Then it
[45:34.240 --> 45:39.320]  has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis.
[45:39.320 --> 45:44.360]  This is all proven. You can make claims with this, but I had to tell you no one has a toothpaste
[45:44.360 --> 45:49.920]  this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy
[45:49.920 --> 45:55.360]  way that doesn't strip away the enamel. So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation
[45:55.360 --> 45:59.880]  infowarstore.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[45:59.880 --> 46:06.080]  The anti defamation league is one of the most powerful, globalist, leftist, anti American
[46:06.080 --> 46:11.480]  organizations on the face of the planet. And they have declared that info wars is public
[46:11.480 --> 46:18.520]  enemy number one. They gave Tim Cook of Apple an award specifically for deplat forming me
[46:18.520 --> 46:23.920]  to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show. And now they've had
[46:23.920 --> 46:30.280]  Sasha Barat-Cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that do not turn
[46:30.280 --> 46:37.240]  full control over to the globalist ADL and they've called for a complete purge of anyone
[46:37.240 --> 46:42.160]  promoting Americana. We are being demoralized. We are being conquered. And the enemy wants
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.480]  to shut info wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to
[46:46.480 --> 46:51.080]  defeat their paradigm. You have helped keep us on the air, but now the attacks are more
[46:51.080 --> 46:55.560]  insane than ever. So please visit infowarstore.com during Black Friday for the biggest sales
[46:55.560 --> 47:01.800]  of the year and fund the info war. Please take action.
[47:01.800 --> 47:23.800]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show. Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[47:23.800 --> 47:32.680]  We want answers. Well, so does he live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's
[47:32.680 --> 47:41.680]  Alex Jones. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, again, welcome
[47:41.680 --> 47:47.640]  to this live Black Friday worldwide broadcast. I'm coming to you from my hotel room in San
[47:47.640 --> 47:59.000]  Diego, California, where my wife and my youngest daughter are visiting with her mom. And of
[47:59.000 --> 48:03.160]  course, I'll be back in Austin, Texas tonight and I'm going to be up there on Saturday and
[48:03.160 --> 48:08.640]  Sunday. Not just for the normal Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., but other special broadcasts because
[48:08.640 --> 48:18.640]  so much is breaking. We've got 244 days left, excuse me, 344 days left. I'm telling you
[48:18.640 --> 48:27.800]  I'm probably free here. 344 days left until the 2020 election and the globalist are just
[48:27.800 --> 48:34.100]  making their moves on every front. The censorship has hit spectacular levels and Trump not taking
[48:34.100 --> 48:39.360]  action against it is a dereliction of duty and has gotten me hopping mad at the president
[48:39.360 --> 48:44.120]  as a lot of you know, know a lot of you are upset. I also intend to open the phones up
[48:44.120 --> 48:49.080]  today to talk about that. But I want to be very, very, very clear about where I stand
[48:49.080 --> 48:55.280]  on the president because I think if we can navigate this, we can understand where the
[48:55.280 --> 49:01.520]  president is, where he needs to go and where we all need to push him to go and just how
[49:01.520 --> 49:07.320]  serious this is, the equivalent of a sudden death over time game for the Super Bowl. I
[49:07.320 --> 49:17.160]  mean, this is, this is nail biter extraordinaire time that we've reached here. And again, I
[49:17.160 --> 49:22.960]  don't normally have butterflies, but trying to get into a subject like this and really
[49:22.960 --> 49:34.760]  trying to nail it is daunting. But I'm going to really do my best to lay this out right
[49:34.760 --> 49:45.880]  now. President Trump has signed the Hong Kong Freedom Bill that Congress passed last week.
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.720]  It's a very good bill, very common sense bill. And communist China had threatened all sorts
[49:51.720 --> 49:55.880]  of hell was going to break, most of Trump signed it. They have now basically back down
[49:55.880 --> 50:01.960]  since Trump signed it because the United States holds almost all the cards, but not for long
[50:01.960 --> 50:08.200]  if we don't play those cards. And so Trump's been trying to get us out of Afghanistan for
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.000]  three years, as he promised to do. He's been bucked by the whole establishment and by the
[50:12.000 --> 50:19.920]  Democrat and Republican parties, but at least he's tried. He's gotten us out of Syria to
[50:19.920 --> 50:24.280]  a great extent. That's wonderful. He went visit the troops. As you know, yesterday on
[50:24.280 --> 50:30.200]  Thanksgiving in Afghanistan, that's a really good thing. He's tried to shore up our borders.
[50:30.200 --> 50:35.600]  He's defended the Second Amendment. He's gotten two good Supreme Court justices appointed
[50:35.600 --> 50:40.760]  compared to what Hillary would have put in. It looks like Ginsburg is long for this world.
[50:40.760 --> 50:48.760]  So you've got that. I am extraordinarily thankful for President Trump being elected. We fought
[50:48.760 --> 50:54.800]  hard to get that done. You fought hard to get that done. If Hillary would have gotten
[50:54.800 --> 50:59.040]  in, she would have started a bunch of big wars. She would have accelerated the censorship.
[50:59.040 --> 51:05.120]  She would have opened the borders fully. But that said, Hillary didn't get in. And so it's
[51:05.120 --> 51:12.000]  Trump that has to answer for the things he's done. And we've now seen three plus years
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.680]  of draconian, un-American cartel activity by the big six tech companies working in criminal
[51:19.680 --> 51:26.760]  coordination, and that's illegal, to suppress nationalist Christians, pro-lifers, conservatives,
[51:26.760 --> 51:33.720]  pro-gun groups, pro-veteran groups, pro-America groups. So it's also disgusting how these
[51:33.720 --> 51:38.360]  globalists hate America, how they thought they had the country down, and how they keep
[51:38.360 --> 51:44.080]  trying to demoralize us. And so this argument, oh, these are private companies. Oh, really?
[51:44.080 --> 51:48.880]  Google putting out that the Republican Party's political affiliation is the Nazi Party? That
[51:48.880 --> 51:54.560]  was up for almost a year. Or how they de-list all the corrupt information about Hillary
[51:54.560 --> 52:00.800]  artificially and then lie about it to Congress. And now I said they're going to go after Republican
[52:00.800 --> 52:07.000]  advertising. They're going to not let Republicans advertise in the 2020 election. And now they've
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.680]  done that at Twitter and now Google. Democrats don't call it campaign ads. They just have
[52:11.680 --> 52:20.440]  thousands of subgroups with big budgets producing so-called short news pieces via now this and
[52:20.440 --> 52:25.400]  Facebook-funded groups. They're spending billions of dollars currently. Several billion of
[52:25.400 --> 52:32.400]  it was spent last year on all this fake news that's really campaign ads. And you see because
[52:32.400 --> 52:37.320]  the Democrats aren't really collecting a lot of money, Trump's two to one right now, the
[52:37.320 --> 52:43.320]  decision has been made, well, don't even let Republicans buy ads to counter what we're
[52:43.320 --> 52:48.600]  doing. And so now they're openly manipulating the election. They're openly engaged in election
[52:48.600 --> 52:55.840]  fraud. They're openly engaged in voter suppression. And we've seen a press release from Brad Parscales
[52:55.840 --> 53:01.560]  and a couple statements and tweets from Trump. So we're failing that test again. And so what's
[53:01.560 --> 53:06.360]  going to happen next is already happening. Hundreds of millions of accounts on Instagram
[53:06.360 --> 53:11.680]  and Facebook, hundreds of millions have been deleted in the last few months. Every major
[53:11.680 --> 53:16.960]  meme site's been deleted off there. Members of Congress are having their Twitter frozen
[53:16.960 --> 53:24.000]  routinely blocked. Republican ads are being blocked everywhere. And it's just going to
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.520]  get worse and worse and worse. And you now see the ADL and others saying that's not enough
[53:30.520 --> 53:37.040]  from Facebook. We want the big tech heads arrested if they don't give us full control.
[53:37.040 --> 53:44.200]  You see, that's an incredibly arrogant out of control statement. Wow, that should wake
[53:44.200 --> 53:49.520]  America up. No, the ADL knows what they're doing. So does the Southern primary law center.
[53:49.520 --> 53:55.040]  If Trump and the American people put up with this and the NRA has had bank accounts taken,
[53:55.040 --> 53:58.800]  it's had merchant accounts taken, barely made the news this year, and thousands of other
[53:58.800 --> 54:03.920]  prominent conservatives, nationalists, pro-livers have had their bank accounts and their shopping
[54:03.920 --> 54:11.240]  carts taken. We're being heard in the digital ghettos and Trump does nothing. Well, what
[54:11.240 --> 54:19.600]  comes next? More economic bullying, more economic targeting. And as you see on screen, AI computer
[54:19.600 --> 54:25.480]  programs developed by Stanford, developed by MIT with taxpayer money given to the ADL
[54:25.480 --> 54:32.520]  and Southern primary law center now in place where AI in live time isn't just blocking
[54:32.520 --> 54:37.240]  when they have Alex Jones in positive mention. That was four months ago, five months ago.
[54:37.240 --> 54:43.560]  Now it's white rights. If you put out an article showing white people being beaten, being attacked,
[54:43.560 --> 54:50.160]  being called names, Facebook blocks it. If you put out a video showing someone screaming
[54:50.160 --> 54:53.920]  a la Akbar when they run people over, it's blocked. If you put out an article saying
[54:53.920 --> 54:57.960]  a Muslim attacked people in New York. Remember two years ago, screaming a la Akbar, running
[54:57.960 --> 55:02.120]  folks over in the truck? Paul Watson put out an article that he was screaming a la Akbar,
[55:02.120 --> 55:06.920]  showed a local news club, Twitter banned it. They had a congressional hearing with Congressman
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.280]  Quigley. He said, during lunch, I saw the number one thing was in full force, Paul Watson,
[55:11.280 --> 55:15.920]  about a la Akbar. That's fake news. And they had a Twitter, Facebook and YouTube in there
[55:15.920 --> 55:20.160]  of the technical heads. They go, sir, we erased it. He goes, I know, but how did it get up
[55:20.160 --> 55:26.400]  there? And they said, sir, the AI will be in place within six months. It is now in place.
[55:26.400 --> 55:30.240]  So we've noticed with our listeners and stuff, if they tweet out a video of ours, saying,
[55:30.240 --> 55:36.240]  wow, a powerful video on this subject, it doesn't get flagged. If you say Alex Jones
[55:36.240 --> 55:41.040]  or info wars, it does. So don't say Alex Jones or info wars. Send out a band on video links
[55:41.040 --> 55:44.720]  and got a news wars link and just say, wow, did you hear about what happened here? This
[55:44.720 --> 55:50.640]  is really powerful. And that's why they don't like memes because AI and the ADL has been
[55:50.640 --> 55:54.280]  bitching about this. So Europe just passed a law banning memes this year. Now they're
[55:54.280 --> 56:00.320]  trying to enforce it with huge fines. It has to be pre approved. You have to upload it
[56:00.320 --> 56:04.640]  through Facebook, Twitter or Google. And then in Europe, this is already in place. Paul
[56:04.640 --> 56:10.200]  Watson videos are already banned in Germany. And they have to upload it through a system
[56:10.200 --> 56:14.200]  that then decides whether we can go through or not. And all it is is memes, is jokes,
[56:14.200 --> 56:24.120]  is comments, pre approved, because AI doesn't know a joke. It doesn't get a joke. It doesn't
[56:24.120 --> 56:29.760]  get that stuff. So the system doesn't even want you joking. It doesn't even want normal
[56:29.760 --> 56:34.760]  human control. This is, this is the communist Chinese social score. This is beyond 94. And
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.280]  we're already living in it. Having a debate about, oh, they're private companies, really.
[56:39.280 --> 56:44.120]  So you let AT&T that already has AI software recording everything you do. That's admitted.
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.880]  Start cutting your call off in live time or time delaying and erasing words you say. It
[56:49.880 --> 56:53.840]  was not approved. It already happens on droids and iPhones when you're sending a message.
[56:53.840 --> 56:59.320]  You try to say F something to somebody. It says, you say F-ing. It says ducking. It's
[56:59.320 --> 57:04.200]  already there, folks. We're already being put into this. And now they're turning it on.
[57:04.200 --> 57:08.600]  They're now flipping the switches to implement this. And Congress, quite frankly, are a bunch
[57:08.600 --> 57:13.120]  of neophyte troglodytes that don't even know what the hell is going on. I'm not against
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.200]  technology. I don't like how it's being deployed against us in a total takeover. So I'll come
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.800]  back and get more into what Trump has to do to counter all this or he will lose the 2020
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.920]  election. And if you don't amplify this message, we're going to lose. They wanted us off the
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.000]  air for a critical reason. I'm going to reveal on the other side of this break, infowars.com,
[57:33.000 --> 57:48.640]  sports.show, newswars.com, sports.show, band.video. Remember, share the band.video live link and share the infowars.com, sports.show, but be sure and show the newswars.com, sports.show, because that's harder to censor.
[57:48.640 --> 58:01.720]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War, when three million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines. More than 50 to one, some
[58:01.720 --> 58:19.200]  estimates have it. But the point is, they were outnumbered and the general was told, General, we're completely surrounded. He said, good, we can attack in all directions. Well, that's the point that infowars has reached. And it really is epic. It really is biblical. And we
[58:19.200 --> 58:31.320]  wouldn't have gone this far without all your support. But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete. And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the
[58:31.320 --> 58:46.360]  world are completely silenced. When it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile, or speaking out against dangerous vaccines, because by infowars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalists.
[58:50.680 --> 59:01.280]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true. But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball. I could see where the globalist
[59:01.280 --> 59:17.720]  were going. I could see what their in game agenda was what their goal was. And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed, that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and
[59:17.720 --> 59:30.800]  names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed. What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future. It was the
[59:30.800 --> 59:46.640]  model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed. And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than
[59:46.640 --> 59:47.320]  ever.
[59:47.320 --> 59:55.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.520 --> 1:00:17.960]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:47.880]  We have to educate President Trump before it's too late. We have to convince the president not to commit sepico not to commit political, cultural suicide and not to destroy the Trump name forever. It will not be synonymous.
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:01:07.960]  It will not be synonymous with overcoming adversity as a Trump card will be associated with upheaval and disaster. Trump has bet his entire family name on restoring the Republican. I believe Trump means well and is for real.
[1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:23.960]  Trump is trying to be a peace maker is trying to get our troops home from endless no win wars is trying to restore our sovereignty is trying to make the president the president again and not just have it be a rubber stamp of the permanent bureaucracy and there's no doubt that the president has
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:42.960]  gotten. The establishment in rage and made them show their hand but if they show their globalist criminal censorship race war divide and conquer pedophile hand. And then we don't rise up and politically culturally economically beat them.
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:58.960]  Well then we have just simply summoned the whirlwind summoned the hurricane the typhoon and allowed ourselves to be destroyed we didn't summon this fight to lose.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  We initiated this countdown to win. President Trump has gotten the establishment to come out and openly admit their aims to silence us to in free speech to break down the family to turn the Internet into a giant surveillance grid and a huge open air reeducation camp
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:38.960]  over that next segment. Well we don't let them then just normalize all of this. And you know sit up there and watch Trump send out interesting tweets and he physically and personally overcomes them.
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:52.960]  We ourselves are hung out to dry and thrown to the wolves thrown overboard. President Trump will stand up for his constituency that's being bullied and attacked and lied about.
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:57.960]  Not from a position of a victim but from the position of troops left behind.
[1:02:57.960 --> 1:03:10.960]  And President Trump must move against big tech for their racketeering they're lying to Congress for their monopolies for their antitrust behavior. The trust they've set up the monopolies.
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:18.960]  And they're working with foreign governments to suppress other foreign populations and we see the beginning of that with the Hong Kong resolution but.
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:31.960]  There's a matter of Trump's good on 90% of issues if he's derelict in his duty to stand up against this globalist onslaught than President Trump.
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:36.960]  Is his own worst enemy and is committing political suicide.
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:39.960]  I want to open the phones up.
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:48.960]  A little bit later in the hour to get your take on this Black Friday of where all this is headed and your view of Trump and what you think he needs to do but it's truly a love hate relationship.
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:51.960]  I know he's for real. I want to see what he does in the second term.
[1:03:51.960 --> 1:04:04.960]  I'm really blessed to be persecuted to support Trump and I'll continue on no matter what but I want Trump to do the right thing and I won't sit here silently and do nothing.
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:15.960]  The main pushes when the globalists were able to get some of their moles in the winehouse was to try to keep info wars information and other populist pro America commonsense information from the president.
[1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:17.960]  What does that tell you about info wars.
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:22.960]  It tells you the globalists see it as kryptonite to their system they see it as coffin nails.
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:26.960]  They see it as silver bullet to a werewolf.
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:28.960]  That's why we've got to keep it on air.
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.960]  That's what we've got to get it out front.
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:35.960]  That's why we've got to continue to follow the model of info wars in other systems that are set up.
[1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:43.960]  When I come back I'm going to explain why they're so scared of info wars and why in their fear of info wars is the seeds of their destruction.
[1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:47.960]  In what they fear and they fight we learn their weak points.
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:48.960]  It's so critical.
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:51.960]  We're going to break it all down on the other side.
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:54.960]  But you do remember you are the light and the dark of the night.
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:55.960]  You are the answer.
[1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:59.960]  You are info wars Black Friday is here with the biggest sale.

[1:05:54.960 --> 1:06:05.960]  Take action now.
[1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:24.960]  A meeting of frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:35.960]  Might as well take a double edged dagger to his crowded arteries and slice his own throat from his left ear.
[1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  To his right ear and watch the large gouts of black red blood spray out on the floor.
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:54.960]  I don't wish that to happen to the president but I'm saying that to be illustrative and to get the president's attention.
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:07:02.960]  Remember three years ago two years ago in a year ago it was all over the news that.
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:09.960]  McMaster, Kelly, Fiona Hill and others were trying to bring in as many Soros people as they could we were exposing that.
[1:07:09.960 --> 1:07:17.960]  And they were desperate to not have Trump get access to our information to our analysis.
[1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:21.960]  Because Trump then would go check what we were saying and find it was true and take action.
[1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:26.960]  We said fire every never Trump or can't believe he didn't check that can't believe he believed.
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:34.960]  His own people like rents previous and others when he first got in the totally sold the country out.
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:43.960]  Now why are they so scared of that because it's real advice it's real research it's people that study globalist that have top guests top experts on over the years.
[1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:49.960]  Insiders who aren't globalist to give the president something he doesn't have advice that's real.
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:51.960]  It's discipline.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:56.960]  The average globalist is just a yes man that plays golf all day and drives around on yachts.
[1:07:56.960 --> 1:08:02.960]  And it's just an insider from an Ivy League school that might work five hours a day.
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.960]  And they just know their own little policy area and do what they're told from the CFR.
[1:08:07.960 --> 1:08:08.960]  They're very lazy.
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:09.960]  They're very stupid.
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:11.960]  We can run circles around them.
[1:08:11.960 --> 1:08:13.960]  All I do is read policy papers.
[1:08:13.960 --> 1:08:14.960]  All I do is read legislation.
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.960]  All I do is talk to other experts that are patriots.
[1:08:17.960 --> 1:08:23.960]  Pentagon CIA foreign leaders engineers top academics.
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:25.960]  Hell you hear and see them here every day.
[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:27.960]  I'm in the game.
[1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  18 hours a day while I'm away.
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.960]  Always in the game.
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:35.960]  I sleep and I think about stuff.
[1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:38.960]  Dedication can run circles around anything.
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:41.960]  You've got intelligence and you've studied history.
[1:08:41.960 --> 1:08:42.960]  And you're not afraid.
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.960]  You can do anything as well.
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:47.960]  It just takes time and focus and energy.
[1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:51.960]  And so like a laser beam we've been burning through the enemy defenses.
[1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  And we've broken through their defenses on many fronts and they know we have proven we have the weapons system.
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:04.960]  A hammer of truth and justice that has tasted their political blood over and over again.
[1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:08.960]  And so if you want to know what the new order fears it fears you.
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:15.960]  It fears highly motivated focused individuals that are dedicated and know they're right and don't care about being attacked.
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:19.960]  Don't care about being lied about and just keep fighting.
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  Nothing can stand against that when we've got God on our side like winds.
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:28.960]  A spiritual interdimensional wind in our sails.
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:34.960]  And God will give us any amount of energy and power we can handle in this fight.
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:37.960]  God will give you unlimited discernment.
[1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.960]  But can you handle it?
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:41.960]  I know I can.
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:43.960]  And that's why I've just turned myself completely over to God.
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:47.960]  I've said you're in control of the control panel.
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:49.960]  Whatever I can take, you're going to do it.
[1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:52.960]  And it's amazing.
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:10:01.960]  I can every day now see switches being flipped on and everything being prepared and load balanced so that I can handle it and don't go insane.
[1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, because the discernment, the clairvoyant abilities that the Bible talks about, all of it is super intense.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:12.960]  Can you really handle it, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:15.960]  Can you really handle the full Holy Spirit?
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:18.960]  Can you really handle the true anointing of God?
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:22.960]  Can you truly handle it? And I'm not saying I'm some wonderful, great person.
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:25.960]  I'm an imperfect vessel that this powerful light shines through.
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:33.960]  And it is awe-inspiring to begin to just look at maybe the edge of God's little toe.
[1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  That's the archetype of Moses couldn't look at God.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:37.960]  He'd look at God through a burning bush.
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:39.960]  So they killed him.
[1:10:39.960 --> 1:10:41.960]  Imagine actually looking at God.
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:47.960]  By looking, that means taking on God, interfacing with God.
[1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:57.960]  That's why the Bible says Moses came down and looked like he'd aged 50 years stumbling around because of the intensity, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:06.960]  of actually interfacing, downloading, and then God's face moving across like a glacier.
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  The enemy fears the Christ energy.
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  And they had to get us off the air, which they haven't been able to do thanks to you,
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:22.960]  ahead of them taking everybody else off.
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:29.960]  And so they've been incrementally taking a few hundred people off, a few thousand people off, a few hundred thousand, a few million.
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:31.960]  Now it's hundreds of millions.
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:33.960]  Now it's going to be everyone.
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:37.960]  And they're saying, Facebook will not allow you to talk about pro-life,
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:43.960]  expose any drug companies, glyphosate, GMO,
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  drag queen story time that is pedophilic, perch testing, grooming.
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:50.960]  They say their own words.
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:51.960]  We're here to groom your kids.
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.960]  Pedophilic grooming.
[1:11:53.960 --> 1:11:56.960]  Anyone puts that out on Facebook or their Twitter.
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  You're restricted to your band.
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.960]  They have to do it.
[1:12:01.960 --> 1:12:06.960]  Basically all human activity that's not AI approved is now going to be banned by early next year.
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:09.960]  It's here, the Chinese Global Social Credit Score.
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:17.960]  And AP is reporting on a guide that no free speech should be allowed at your Thanksgiving table.
[1:12:17.960 --> 1:12:23.960]  You need to instruct conservatives when they come that no speech is allowed that's political.
[1:12:23.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  And the moderator is the liberal because they know best.
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  It's actually a big article about it on m4wars.com with the AP story.
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:39.960]  And they say that if there will be debate, there's a free speech zone in a bedroom or a room.
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:41.960]  And then the liberal will take you there.
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:42.960]  They're the referee.
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.960]  They're the priest.
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:47.960]  They'll be ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center approved.
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:51.960]  They even have a guide that's ADL approved now at your Thanksgiving dinner.
[1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:53.960]  And this is a reeducation camp.
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:55.960]  Your house is now a reeducation camp.
[1:12:55.960 --> 1:12:57.960]  And these are little control freaks.
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:02.960]  And then they will tell you if you want to talk politics, you go to this special room.
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:10.960]  Twitter users mock AP for P suggesting designated rooms and moderators for impeachment talk on Thanksgiving, Breitbart.
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:17.960]  And AP, the AP spoke to adequate coach Elaine Swan in an article titled on the Thanksgiving menu,
[1:13:17.960 --> 1:13:20.960]  Turkey with a side of impeachment.
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:25.960]  Thanksgiving hosts should designate a specific room for all potentially heated political discussions
[1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:28.960]  and establish a moderator, according to Los Angeles based etiquette coach.
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:31.960]  And it goes on telling you how to do it.
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:33.960]  They want in your life.
[1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:35.960]  They want to tell you how to raise your children.
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:37.960]  In fact, they say you shouldn't be able to raise your children.
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.960]  They say that when the men dresses women come to pre-puddle your children and exchange emails,
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:46.960]  pass codes, Facebook numbers with them and phone numbers,
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:53.960]  you're not to be told that a man came to your school and that your child sat in their lap and that they want to meet with them.
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:56.960]  That's coming up.
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  So that's why M4s has to stay on the air.
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:04.960]  How many outlets are there that have radio, TV, with radio and TV satellites,
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:07.960]  have their own studios and their own reporters and crew?
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:08.960]  Almost no one.
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:09.960]  The NRA had it.
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:12.960]  The globalists infiltrated it, almost overthrew it.
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.960]  And so the NRA board has basically silenced everybody.
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:17.960]  I'm not allowed to get into the details.
[1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:19.960]  I'll just leave it at that.
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:24.960]  But I've confirmed from high level NRA board members that they're not just allowed to do my show.
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  They're not allowed to do anybody's shows.
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:32.960]  The NRA has ordered them.
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:33.960]  That's right.
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  Everyone's being silenced.
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:35.960]  We had the NRA.
[1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:38.960]  Fox News is pretty horrible now other than a few shows.
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.960]  And Imports is there.
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:41.960]  Drugs Report is out there.
[1:14:41.960 --> 1:14:43.960]  There's Daily Call or stuff like that.
[1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:45.960]  Who has multimedia?
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:46.960]  Us.
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.960]  And as things get worse and worse and as everyone's shut down,
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:49.960]  last man's standing.
[1:14:49.960 --> 1:14:53.960]  And we're seeing traffic to info wars go up and up and up and up.
[1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:55.960]  Because now people are like, oh, that was just,
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:56.960]  Jones got shut down.
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  Now everybody's getting shut down.
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  And others are self-censoring so they won't get shut down or basically becoming globalists.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:08.960]  So there's not rumors of massive censorship coming in December.
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:09.960]  It's already here.
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:11.960]  It's logarithmic.
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:12.960]  It's exponential.
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:20.960]  And Trump not acting on system-wide upfront AI controlling basically what words you can use,
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:22.960]  what letters in the alphabet are authorized.
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:23.960]  It's that level.
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:26.960]  It is a total AI takeover of all language and information.
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:31.960]  The electronic straitjackets going into place because it was done incrementally.
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  Like the frog in the pot, people aren't noticing.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  Congress isn't acting.
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:37.960]  They failed every test allowing the censorship.
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:39.960]  And so all hell is here.
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:43.960]  But even though Trump's standing down and Congress is standing down, they're a teriatric stupor.
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:44.960]  We're not.
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:48.960]  We're hitting third dimension rallies, taking over live TV events legally and lawfully.
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:49.960]  You're doing it as well.
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:53.960]  Just like we jumped up on stage and said, you know, Bill Clinton's a rapist who's similar stuff.
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  Take over the internet.
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:55.960]  Take over the third dimension now.
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:56.960]  Maybe not today.
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:57.960]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:01.960]  But soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:02.960]  Forget bunkers.
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:04.960]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:10.960]  You need survivalist camps, the ultimate fully functional off the grid mobile survival bug outhouse

[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:55.960]  United States of Empire by James Dunn available at Amazon books.
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:57.960]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:02.960]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:04.960]  But the symptoms are there.
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:10.960]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:12.960]  that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:18.960]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.960]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:22.960]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:27.960]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[1:17:56.960 --> 1:18:05.960]  The Anti-Defamation League is one of the most powerful, globalist, leftist, anti-American organizations on the face of the planet.
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:10.960]  And they have declared that Info Wars is public enemy number one.
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:20.960]  They gave Tim Cook of Apple an award specifically for de-platforming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show.
[1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:30.960]  And now they've had Sasha Baron Cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that do not turn full control over to the globalist ADL.
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  And they've called for a complete purge of anyone promoting Americana.
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:38.960]  We are being demoralized. We are being conquered.
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:44.960]  And the enemy wants to shut Info Wars down because they understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat their paradigm.
[1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:49.960]  You have helped keep us on the air, but now the attacks are more insane than ever.
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.960]  So please visit infowarstore.com during Black Friday for the biggest sales of the year and fund the Info War.
[1:18:54.960 --> 1:18:55.960]  Please take action.
[1:18:55.960 --> 1:19:03.960]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[1:19:03.960 --> 1:19:09.960]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:10.960]  Think about that.
[1:19:10.960 --> 1:19:14.960]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:23.960]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:25.960]  They know what they're doing.
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:33.960]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:37.960]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[1:19:37.960 --> 1:19:42.960]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment,
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:46.960]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:49.960]  and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:55.960]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:40.960]  How many times must I tell you, baby? How many bridges I got to cross? How many times must I explain myself?
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:43.960]  Putting Trump into power was only the beginning.
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:47.960]  Now we have to restore the republic. Now we have to kick the globalist out.
[1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:56.960]  We have to realize the communist program that these mega banks use to bring down civilizations and remove it before it's too late.
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:21:04.960]  We're going to be joined by E. Michael Jones, who is a world-renowned Catholic historian and Amazon bestselling author,
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:10.960]  best known for a whole string of amazing books, culturewars.com.
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:18.960]  One of the books that I have actually read, I'm looking forward to reading the others, is Monsters from the Id.
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:25.960]  So he looks at the attempted breakdown of civilization and culture, and some of the forces that are involved in that,
[1:21:25.960 --> 1:21:31.960]  and why the massive censorship of the Southern Property Law Center, the ADL, and others that he's been targeted by,
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:36.960]  he will be joining us coming up in the second hour today.
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:41.960]  We'll also talk about Sacha Baron Cohen, who set a rest, Mark Zuckerberg, and the other big tech heads,
[1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:49.960]  if they don't turn full control of big tech to these leftist organizations.
[1:21:49.960 --> 1:21:53.960]  And of course, they're also calling for myself and others to be fully purged as well.
[1:21:53.960 --> 1:21:57.960]  So E. Michael Jones will join us today from culturewars.com.
[1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:04.960]  All of you listening on the Internet or on local radio or TV stations, please tell folks that he's coming on by tweeting about it,
[1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:09.960]  by putting it out on Facebook, by putting it out on YouTube, or by word of mouth, or by email or text message.
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:12.960]  Just don't put infowars.com or Alex Jones in the byline.
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:19.960]  Just say, hey, big guest is coming on to discuss the attempted takedown of civilization and why culture is undermined.
[1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:24.960]  Here's the link at band.video and send out the link of the live show today.
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:29.960]  Band.video or newswars.com forward slash show.
[1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:36.960]  Those URLs are not blocked by the sensors for now, and so you won't get banned or censored using those links in our experience,
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:40.960]  newswars.com forward slash show or band.video.
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.960]  So please share those links.
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:43.960]  It's so pivotal.
[1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:50.960]  E. Michael Jones coming up and joining us at the start of the next hour.
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.960]  Then Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting the fourth hour from summit.news.
[1:22:55.960 --> 1:23:00.960]  Okay, getting back to Trump, then I'll let all the other news and come back from break.
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:05.960]  President Trump could do all these great things, do all these wonderful things,
[1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:11.960]  but if he doesn't get reelected, we allow the Democrats to have people vote in the names of millions of dead people
[1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:15.960]  and folks off the voting rolls, which is confirmed.
[1:23:15.960 --> 1:23:25.960]  If we allow the massive systemic censorship of all nationalist patriots and Christians and pro-ifers, which is now going on with AI systems that
[1:23:25.960 --> 1:23:33.960]  pre-screen and block people up front, and we're allowing the Revolution of tyranny to take place.
[1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:40.960]  And then Trump just becomes a figurehead to make us feel like somebody's fighting for us while we're being strangled,
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:50.960]  kind of like folks in both cells on either side of Epstein said that when they were attacking him and he was fighting for his life,
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:56.960]  screaming and begging, then they started saying, breathe, Epstein, breathe as, of course, a joke.
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:03.960]  So is Trump really got a tourniquet around our necks, strangling us to death, and then saying breathe, breathe, breathe?
[1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:06.960]  I don't think he personally is doing that.
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:11.960]  But he's definitely got the deep state mad at him. That's a very, very positive point.
[1:24:11.960 --> 1:24:18.960]  Very, very good point showing he's for real, that they're so angry and so mad, and their attacks on him are very, very real.
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:21.960]  He's getting people a lot better in the Supreme Court than Hillary would.
[1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:27.960]  He's trying to secure the borders. He got us out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, global government, that Hillary helped write and bragged about.
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:32.960]  He's done so many other good things. He's saying we deserve to have a border, that it's okay to have a nation state.
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:39.960]  He's challenging MSM lies. He's challenging political correctness. I love it. It's wonderful.
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:48.960]  So it's kind of like having your dad or something you love, and he's a great guy, but if he's not taking the medication or something that will kill him,
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:55.960]  if he doesn't take it, you're mad at dad for not doing the thing he needs to do, like standing up to the censorship, taking action.
[1:24:55.960 --> 1:25:02.960]  And why they're paralyzed is because the biggest lobbyists in D.C. now are big tech. They're burrowed into everything.
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  They're spying on everybody, and they've gotten away with murder for 30 years. They can do whatever they want.
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:13.960]  Illegal spying. They're hooked into the government. They work with the NSA, and there's all those secrets and all those consultants in government.
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:20.960]  And the deep state that also work at big tech and are making millions and millions apiece, in some cases, billions apiece.
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:28.960]  You've got 800,000-plus private intelligence operatives with top-level security clearances from all these big think tanks and all these big groups
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:33.960]  that are interfaced and are getting away with murder and the sell-off of the country.
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:37.960]  And Trump said no to China and no to the one side of deals, and now NATO is going to pay part of its share.
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:45.960]  And so South Korea, Trump's doing a lot of good things, but he's not addressing the jewel in the crown, the suppression of voters,
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:57.960]  the suppression of the election, the suppression of his voters, and the criminal activity taking place that Professor Epstein has exposed last year and this year.
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:04.960]  So that's really the most critical point here, is that they're able to suppress what everybody's doing.
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  They're able to suppress the voters at a level never before seen. In fact, we have that two-minute piece that Harrison put together.
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  It's got air raid sirens and drum beats under it. Maybe you guys can find that during the break. I want to air that next segment.
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:21.960]  We probably aired it 30, 40 times, but it's been months since we aired it.
[1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:27.960]  Maybe Owen aired it. I listened to most of the show, but he didn't listen to all of it. I had asked him to air it.
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:37.960]  But where it is two minutes, he lays out how Google can steal elections by just not sending voter notifications to conservatives but sending it to liberals,
[1:26:37.960 --> 1:26:42.960]  which they're doing. They're gaming every level at every point.
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:46.960]  And again, Trump doing nothing has greenlit this whole thing.
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:49.960]  So if he doesn't take action on that, we're screwed.
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:55.960]  Now, I'm very, very pleased about what he's doing in Hong Kong. Again, it's all wonderful.
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:27:01.960]  It's kind of like, you know, you have a great life and everything's good and you exercise every day and you take care of yourself and you take a cyanide pill.
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:02.960]  It's going to kill you.
[1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:12.960]  So I'm just saying, please, Trump, don't keep feeding a cyanide. Please do something, do your job, take action, do something, do something, do something, do something, do something, do something, do something.
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:16.960]  People ask, why is Matt Drudge showing both sides on Trump?
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:19.960]  I haven't talked to Matt. He's very reclusive.
[1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:23.960]  And I get why. Hell, I wish I was. I wish I'd have gone on that same path.
[1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:31.960]  But Drudge has told us why he's mad six months ago when he would put up videos where I'd say, Trump, why are you committing political suicide?
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:34.960]  Why aren't you fighting the censorship? Why the hell are you supporting red flag laws?
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:39.960]  He backed off. Why are you not doing anything about all of this?
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.960]  Why are you not indicting the deep state? Why, why, why, why, why, why?
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:50.960]  Because if I'm getting massively harassed and persecuted, and I'm sitting there taking it because we're in a war,
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  imagine what it's like for everybody else getting persecuted.
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:28:05.960]  You know, I'd imagine if they've run dirty tricks against me and all sorts of stuff behind the scenes and fake private investigators in New York Times and Washington Post reporters camped out in Austin for years and trying to pay people to make stuff up.
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:11.960]  I could imagine being a Tucker Carlson is not very fun. I could imagine being a Matt Drudge isn't very fun.
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  I could imagine being a Sean Hannity is not very fun. I could imagine being a Rush Limbaugh is not very fun.
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:23.960]  I could imagine if you're just loyal to America and care about what's happening and care about the president that you're being persecuted.
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:28.960]  Well, Mr. President, we need to hear solidarity from you. We need to hear that you understand what's happening.
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:35.960]  And we need to see some damn action because it's serious and they're going to steal the election from you.
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:40.960]  And I don't want that to happen because they're not just going to leave you alone once they steal the election.
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:47.960]  You know you can't resign. They want to destroy the image of Trump and a populist nationalist and they're never going to stop us.
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:52.960]  They're going to get your family. They're going to get everybody. And if your family's dumb enough to believe, they're not going to get destroyed.
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:29:14.960]  If you get destroyed, they're idiots. And I don't think they are.
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:34.960]  Plus, Flash Routers also enhances your wireless network performance and unlocks powerful router management tools to let you take total control of your network.

[1:30:15.960 --> 1:30:30.960]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached. And it really is epic. It really is biblical. And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:49.960]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete. And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:56.960]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalists.
[1:30:56.960 --> 1:31:08.960]  Black Friday is here. And the sales are so numerous, there is no way to go over all of them. But let me just give you an example of some of the sales we have running right now.

[1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:56.960]  That's right, triple-patria points, only this Black Friday at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:32:59.960]  Fear of missing out is a serious condition it can only be...
[1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:03.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:03.960 --> 1:33:29.960]  We are back live. I'm your host Alex Jones. You know, it's got to be a bummer for people like Professor Epstein to have the name Epstein, which is a pretty common name.
[1:33:29.960 --> 1:33:47.960]  And then be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, but he's a great guy, a great professor, and has absolutely documented how the election fraud, how the voter suppression really is what it is, is going on by Google, by design, everything the left claims that they're trying to stop.
[1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:53.960]  And so that's why I'm harping on this. I've got so much amazing news. It's very important. I'm going to get to it right now.
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:34:15.960]  It's just that this is an organized event, and you have the heads of Google in a video conference going out to the entire Google employee system the day after Hillary lost on November 9th, 2016, saying we're never going to allow this to happen again.
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:31.960]  And then you've got all the internal videos by Veritas, the smoking guns, the lying to Congress, the everything. And Google and Apple are helping suppress the Chinese people at levels as big as World War II.
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:45.960]  I mean, this is, this is Nazi level stuff. And there's not a damn thing heard out of him because Tim Cook literally talks like a Nelly and I don't care that Tim Cook's gay, but there's this thing where the guy's super skinny and like, oh, I'm lippid.
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:51.960]  Oh, it's like, oh, that's okay then that you have factories that have suicide nets around.
[1:34:51.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  But again, the left is expert at acting non-threatening. If Tim Cook was in a black uniform, he would be in prison.
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:15.960]  But because Tim Cook looks like, you know, again, that he's an interior decorator or something, because he acts like a flaming interior decorator, it's okay that he runs death camps basically.
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:22.960]  And he's really pissed at me for pointing that out. But man, dude, I don't care if you're heterosexual or homosexual, you're a frickin' tyrant.
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:31.960]  And you're bulldozing our free speech and I want your ass in prison. You know, Sasha Barrico and once Big Tech in jail, if they don't censor everybody, he talks about Martin Zuckerberg.
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:46.960]  Zuckerberg just hasn't given control over to the ADL. You know who has? Tim Cook. And he got their Torch of Liberty Award for censoring me.
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:36:02.960]  And how it's holy, he said. I played the clip last week. He actually says it's holy, but it's sacred, which is the same thing as holy.
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:13.960]  But it's sacred. He'll do what's right and take him off the air. Why? Because I'm going to point out how frickin' dangerous you are, dude.
[1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:19.960]  The left walks up to me in the streets of America and they go, you Russian agent, you piece of trash. You're going to prison.
[1:36:19.960 --> 1:36:26.960]  Or they go, how dare you say that about Sandy Hook and hurt people's feelings. And I go, I barely ever talked about that. You're the people that hype it up constantly.
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:32.960]  But yeah, I question events because the government lies so much about things. And I'm proud that I've questioned things.
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:42.960]  And I'm sorry that we have to question things we've been lied to so much that sometimes we're wrong and hurt people's feelings. But that's the way it is.
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:52.960]  And I looked at the very person that last kid in front of me about that this week. That's on Tuesday to my face.
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:37:00.960]  And I went, you know, just like Syria and the chemical weapons attack really being launched by the White Helmets.
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:06.960]  And they went, oh, that's it. I'm so sick of you. You need to be arrested.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:17.960]  And I went, no, it's declassified. It's come out that the last four chemical attacks were not launched by the rebels. Obama puts a red line, says if there's a chemical attack, we're going to invade.
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:25.960]  The rebels do it to get us to invade. The person was just cussing at me and saying, leave me alone. They'll always come over and get in my face.
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  And then as soon as I go, hey, let's talk.
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:37.960]  They start calling me names, Russian agent, Sandy Hook, Ukraine, white supremacist.
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:43.960]  And then I go, listen, I'm a human. I want to be able to break through to you. I care. What about the fake WMDs?
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:49.960]  And they just, they won't listen. They begin cussing and then say, get away, get away, get away. You've seen it on video.
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:38:00.960]  It's like, it's like I'm a TV show. It's like I'm homeland character who is supposedly based on me, you know, this criminal liar on the opposite.
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:09.960]  But again, they project that onto me. And then I'm not supposed to talk back. I'm just supposed to sit there. I'm supposed to just take it.
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:15.960]  And again, I'm not a victim. I'm an overcomer. I don't tell you the bad things happening to me.
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:24.960]  Because I'm a victim. I'm telling you because how I've been attacked is the blueprint on how to beat them.
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:29.960]  They don't want standalone independent multimedia. We're basically it.
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:36.960]  You know how many chills I just got saying that I don't take any pleasure being the only thing like us.
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:42.960]  Do you understand how much danger we're in because of that? I want to be made obsolete. I pray to that every night.
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:47.960]  I want to see other talk show host. I want to see other multimedia that's pro-American, pro-freedom, pro-human.
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:52.960]  And I want to be made obsolete. I don't want to work taking hours a day. But I'm not exhausted. It's the opposite.
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:58.960]  I am literally overcome and basically possessed with resistance in a good way.
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:03.960]  But I just want to beat these people. And I can't do it without you.
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:08.960]  I need you to really get aggressive. Spread the word about news wars.com and force.com and band.video.
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:15.960]  I need businesses to run ads for us. I need you just to take action. Put it on the side of your bar and pay for an airplane to toeinfoors.com behind it.
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:20.960]  Start your own website. Start your own website and scrape in force. It's fully authorized.
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:25.960]  We should put a code out where everybody can actually grab our site and syndicate it easier.
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:32.960]  You just take everything we do. It's free to air. You put it out under a new URL. They won't be able to stop it as easy.
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:41.960]  Here's what I'm trying to get at. The fact that they want us shut down shows their weak point.
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:46.960]  They don't want the president getting good intel. It shows how weak they are, how easy they are to beat.
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:52.960]  Their global authoritarianism is illegitimate. But it has to operate unopposed.
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:59.960]  So if you simply third dimensionally speak out, get involved, don't back down, you're going to win. They know that.
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:04.960]  That's why they beta tested on me the last few years. Then they moved on to nationalists and patriots.
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:12.960]  Now they're moving on to everybody. The total AI control can do this. You don't need millions of moderators to control billions of people.
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:20.960]  AI watching in live time can do it. And it's going to get better doing it. That's why it's got to be outlawed, folks.
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:27.960]  And it can be done. We need moratoriums now. This is the takeover. It's not coming. The AI takeover isn't coming.
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:37.960]  The censorship singularity, you heard that here first, is now. The singularity just means it's ubiquitous, it's total, it's maximum, it's omnipresent.
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:50.960]  And within their sandboxes that are 96% of the internet is the big six tech companies. They have basically omnipotent control.
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:55.960]  Do you understand what that means? You must exercise speech now as a prime imperative.
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:41:03.960]  We'll come back and play the clip of the professor breaking this down. But again, I say it, if we don't have a rapid awakening in Congress,
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:13.960]  a rapid awakening with the president, if we don't slap ourselves in the face, you don't say, wake up, put some cold water on our head,
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.960]  do an ice bucket challenge, whatever the hell you want, if we don't do that and get serious, we're going to lose it all.
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:26.960]  You understand? They're already putting cancer viruses and all the vaccines. They're already killing you. Most of us are already walking dead.
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:35.960]  We're losing years off our life, expecting to see basically every year now. You understand how that compounds? People are going to be dying at 50 in just a few years on average.
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:40.960]  You know, your kids are all going to die. Everybody's going to die. You understand? They already killed us.
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:45.960]  We've got to reverse this now because they're exponentially escalating the soft kill right now.
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:52.960]  We're entering the frog point when the water gets so hot that if he doesn't jump out now, he passes out and dies.
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:59.960]  We're passing out right now. Wake up. Man, if I had to cut my fingers off, get your attention, I'd do it. You understand that?
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:06.960]  I'm serious, folks. People say, why are you willing to die for this? Because it's death for everybody.
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:12.960]  The only way out of this is saying no. The only way out of it is having an epiphany and admitting they're this evil.
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:17.960]  I know you aren't like that, so you can't believe it. I understand that.
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:26.960]  But now it's all out in the open, and you better find your humanity, and you better find God's strength, and you better find out ways to get this out, or we're going to lose everything.
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:34.960]  Do you understand me? I'm not going to stand by and watch my children committed to being slow killed and poisoned, and I swear to God to all the globalists,
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:42.960]  if we don't fix this peacefully and you pieces of demonic filth continue to win, you will be helped as a big animal, and you know it. I swear to God.
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:50.960]  I'm the altar of God that everyone needs to pray for your destruction and your downfall and you to be punished for serving evil and what you've done.
[1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:56.960]  The children need us, and the children demand and cry out to God for justice, and we are God's answer.
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:04.960]  The Anti-Defamation League is one of the most powerful, globalist, leftist, anti-American organizations on the face of the planet.
[1:43:04.960 --> 1:43:19.960]  And they have declared that Info Wars is public enemy number one. They gave Tim Cook of Apple an award specifically for de-platforming me to make sure that tens of millions of people could not hear the show.
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:29.960]  And now they've had Sasha Baron Cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads that do not turn full control over to the globalist ADL,
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:39.960]  and they've called for a complete purge of anyone promoting Americana. We are being demoralized, we are being conquered, and the enemy wants to shut Info Wars down
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:48.960]  because they understand that we've got their number and know how to defeat their paradigm. You have helped keep us on the air, but now the attacks are more insane than ever.
[1:43:48.960 --> 1:43:55.960]  So please visit infowarstore.com during Black Friday for the biggest sales of the year and fund the Info War. Please take action.
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:44:08.960]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:17.960]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:28.960]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist,
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:42.960]  or that there's no free will, there's no devil or the God. But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:51.960]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping. University's the U.S. have banned 21 Gun Salutes for veterans.
[1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:55.960]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:45:12.960]  Info War's Black Friday is here with the biggest sales of the year. 50% off on DNA Force Plus. Triple Patriot Points, free shipping and a free bottle of our best-selling,

[1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:57.960]  This is the big Black Friday sale at infowarstore.com. The biggest sale of the year and it funds the Info War. Take action now.
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:06.960]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true. But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:13.960]  I could see where the globalists were going. I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:21.960]  And I knew that when they were setting us up to be deplatformed, that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air,
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:31.960]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:37.960]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:46.960]  It was the model of Info Wars as much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies
[1:46:46.960 --> 1:47:08.960]  and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping Info Wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:25.960]  You are either with the Republic or against it. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:33.960]  Alright, I've aired this a lot but not enough because Trump's finally starting to get it as soon as they started blocking Republican political ads.
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:43.960]  All the Democrats simply run all their ads under a different name. If he doesn't act now, it doesn't matter whether he's compromised or not,
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:48.960]  it's the same effect. So we've got to put maximum heat on the White House. The globalists are scared of that because the president does listen.
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:57.960]  Everybody should just travel and just bullhorn Marlago whenever he's there, bullhorn the White House, whatever it takes and say act against the damn censorship now.
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:48:04.960]  We've only got 344 days to the election. We've only got really a month or two for him to take action. It's all over.
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:12.960]  And I'm not going to be doom and gloom. I think we all agree. We all know that and it's just outrageous. It's a lot bigger than political censorship.
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:22.960]  It's the AI takeover that is here. Here's Professor Robert Rosenstein. Robert Epstein breaking this down. Here it is.
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:33.960]  Google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016. Is that correct?
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:48.960]  2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum. The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:49:01.960]  They control these and no one can counteract them. These are not competitive. These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:11.960]  Your testimony is that Google is through bias in search results manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of.
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:24.960]  On a massive scale in 2020 if all these companies are supporting the same candidate there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:33.960]  and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace. Without monitoring systems in place we'll never know what these companies are doing.
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:50.960]  And in 2020 you can bet that we have the one with their returns. Get ready. I'm going to hear it again.
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:50:05.960]  Most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years. A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars if not billions of dollars collectively.
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:10.960]  Massively influencing the results of elections.
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:23.960]  Senator with respect I must correct you please. If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go vote reminder just to Democrats on Election Day that doesn't cost him a dime.
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:31.960]  Now we made a little mistake today but it's a very illustrative and so it's it's a good thing we're going to make.
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:47.960]  We're going to eliminate elements here back when one of our great crew members reporters Harrison Smith put together that report six seven months ago. I said you know why is it kind of happy comfortable music like I'm walking through a park or something.
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:51:03.960]  Why don't we put air raid sirens and drum beats to it because this is globalist marching to steal our birthright to steal our election and literally enslave us and take our speech. I want drum beats and air raid sirens but to it and they did then put drum beats and air raid sirens to it.
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:18.960]  And it went viral and got millions of views. We should probably have somebody put that back out on Twitter or Facebook but they'll probably call it election meddling to have a computer scientist and psychologist you know expose that you know congressional testimony can't see that that's fake news.
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:21.960]  They're actually starting to do that at Facebook.
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:40.960]  But it's so important so at the end of the next hour after our guest leaves this I'm going to air the one with the air raid sirens because that gives you the earnestness you know in the past armies came in ships and they came in armored vehicles and they came in in airplanes and helicopters and boy you saw that you'd get motivated.
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:51.960]  But when it comes with computers and oh non threatening effeminate sounding men oh they're not like that behind the scenes folks they're smart.
[1:51:51.960 --> 1:51:53.960]  They're camouflaged.
[1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:56.960]  They know what they're doing.
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:01.960]  And that goes back to the whole British aristocracy would talk in effeminate voices and be very polite.
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:11.960]  That was so they'd notice normal people they got in their midst. They wouldn't let you get near them. But they need to pull their sword out and chop you up. Believe me they do it very quickly with a big demonic smile on their face.
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:19.960]  And they wouldn't be talking in the little you know tart voice anymore a little candy ass voice anymore.
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:29.960]  And I'm telling you that it's the same facade the same people behind the scenes are just like I mean believe me I've seen some of them.
[1:52:29.960 --> 1:52:34.960]  And as soon as people start realizing people running things are.
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:40.960]  I mean you see at Pito story time when they get your kids they're going.
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:50.960]  You have to understand that's their face I make that face you know Skelter does it in public so do others Skelter will be sitting there on the red carpet and he he loves me worshipped.
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:59.960]  He'll he'll he'll he'll suddenly just go because that you have to understand that's who they are.
[1:52:59.960 --> 1:53:09.960]  Look at look at Jimmy Savell and Prince Charles you know Prince Andrew is being thrown out he's all in trouble blah blah blah for a 17 year old girl which he should get in trouble for she was really 14 when it started.
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:19.960]  But they're doing that to make it all about him to cover up that his best buddy was a pedophile and actually again would torture the hell out of kids and bring children to Prince Charles.
[1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:22.960]  Who's gonna be the king of England.
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:31.960]  So let's get into that right now teacher who supported drag queen visiting school says parents shouldn't have final say close quote in raising their children.
[1:53:31.960 --> 1:53:45.960]  Some of you as a quote don't know what is best for your kids aren't going to tell you that a full grown man's coming dresses a woman to have your kids sit in their laps and then exchange contact information without you knowing with them.
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:56.960]  I mean if your daughter 17 had moved out of the house and some 40 year old dude showed up at the school and gave his number to her you go listen buddy she ain't 18 stay away from my daughter you creep.
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:54:04.960]  But when it's a 40 year old man dresses a woman a lot of cases these people are convicted pedophiles in Houston other areas there's been cases.
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:09.960]  And they get up on TV and say we're here to hide we're here to groom your kids dressed up like clowns.
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:15.960]  It's so over the top of the schools condoning it oh it's the authority people give in.
[1:54:15.960 --> 1:54:20.960]  The Texas principal has defended this.
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:27.960]  Just like in Colorado they have them unannounced access on career day with elementary students.
[1:54:27.960 --> 1:54:32.960]  You can look at the statistics the average third grader has a cell phone.
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:39.960]  In middle school it's over 80% and by high school it's over 90% have phones and so.
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:41.960]  Hey how you doing.
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:43.960]  I'm going to give you my number.
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:44.960]  Okay.
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:45.960]  Come on.
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:48.960]  Give me your ears.
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:50.960]  And they make feeding faces.
[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:53.960]  I know your children.
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:55.960]  Very friendly.
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:55:04.960]  It's all in your face all out in the open they're taking over every major institution.
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:08.960]  And this is what goes on ladies and gentlemen in America and in the world.
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:12.960]  Meanwhile Merkel says criticizing it should be made illegal and they have to ban speech to protect freedom.
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:15.960]  That's a quote in full wars dot com.
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:20.960]  But don't worry remember last election all the fake news it wasn't us.
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:25.960]  We might have gotten like five stories wrong out of thousands we admitted it when we did they went oh look he's fake.
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:28.960]  No we correct things when we're wrong.
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:35.960]  Remember that former Obama operatives creating fake news sites to help Democrats win election.
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:39.960]  And they've got all these dozens and dozens of fake sites that put out fake headlines.
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:43.960]  Trump cutting veterans benefits from actually increased them.
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:46.960]  Trump you know killing kids in cages not true.
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:51.960]  They spoke Twitter and all them. Oh the ADL isn't worried about that.
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.960]  They're all for it.
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:57.960]  And again all these Democrats are doing is what MSM already does.
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:03.960]  All these fake news sites to put out fake info but none of that's election airing.
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:05.960]  They're all allowed to do it.
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:08.960]  Remember Universal Pictures Chai com funded.
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:11.960]  Remember last election four years ago.
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:19.960]  Trump has caught running hundreds of fake sites putting out incredible fake news as well that left to see and then believe we're going to go to break.

[2:00:01.960 --> 2:00:30.960]  So the globalists are just people that have turned their humanity over to tyrants and they're people that have given up on their own humanity and they want us to give up on it.
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:35.960]  They've given their godless hateful demonic world.
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:40.960]  And they're pushing harder and harder than ever before to bully us into submission.
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:44.960]  They've got a lot of people just in the position of laying down and taking it.
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:47.960]  And now what they're demanding is more and more fantastical.
[2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:51.960]  Don't say mother and father on entrance forms for kids.
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:56.960]  You know don't even have church steeples that are crosses those are offensive.
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:58.960]  Don't clap at university events.
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:04.960]  It's always seeing what they can get you to do when they say jump you say how high.
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:10.960]  And then Merkel as I mentioned comes out and says in a speech it's time to take everybody's speech away to protect freedom.
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:12.960]  That's an assault on reality.
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:18.960]  Obama's people and list who's doing it from his last campaign putting up all these fake sites to demonize and lie about people.
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:24.960]  There won't be any news articles about that criticizing because it's a good thing to lie to us.
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:28.960]  That's what mainstream media already does but in info wars we're exposing it.
[2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:32.960]  You see but they don't want it called out.
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:34.960]  But here's the big one.
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:39.960]  Tyranny alert info wars dot com news wars dot com.
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:43.960]  People saw this article and didn't believe it went and checked the bill and thought it was true.
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:46.960]  I got a lot of calls about this the last two days.
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:49.960]  Virginia to outlaw Krav Maga.
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:56.960]  Billions jujitsu kickboxing Tai Chi firearms instruction and self defense training.
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:04.960]  That's after Charlottesville and because a woman died they're claiming the right wing new paramilitary fighting techniques which isn't even true.
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:10.960]  It's an attempt to have Antifa trained to attack us but then not everybody else knows self defense.
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:14.960]  It would even criminalize a father teaching his own son how to use a hunting rifle.
[2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:19.960]  Specifically the losses that a person is guilty of unlawful paramilitary activity.
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:30.960]  If the person assembles with one or more persons for the purpose of training with practicing with are being instructed in the use of any firearm.
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:38.960]  Explosive or incendiary device or technique capable of causing injury or death to persons.
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:45.960]  The phrase technique capable of causing injury or death to persons covers all forms of martial arts self defense training.
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:53.960]  Including Krav Maga BJJ boxing and other contact martial arts such as Taekwondo and Tai Chi.
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:03:01.960]  The proposed law again run by Democrats now in Virginia all forms of self defense training including hand to hand and martial arts training.
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:10.960]  Would be considered paramilitary activity even the training consists of private classes involving just one instructor and one student.
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:16.960]  That's because every form of martial arts training impart skills which should be used to cause injury to other persons.
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:27.960]  In fact according to language in the law just one person learning such an art is a felony crime which means that watching a DVD on Krav Maga would be a felony crime.
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:35.960]  Here's the full text of the proposed law it's Senate bill number 64 offer January 8 2020.
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:42.960]  That's when they go into session pre filed November 21 2019.
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:45.960]  And would it surprise you know they're introducing similar laws around the country.
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:53.960]  It's illegal to know how to breathe how to walk how to defend yourself they want you domesticated indoors plugged into the matrix.
[2:03:53.960 --> 2:04:05.960]  Depressed and unhappy believing whatever lies they tell you in these Facebook echo chambers where most of them are bots controlling you and their own chief executive Sean Parker admitted previously.
[2:04:05.960 --> 2:04:09.960]  That they set it up to make you depressed and control you that's what it's all about.
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:18.960]  I'm here to empower you I'm here to tell you you're under attack not so you're a victim but so you realize how important you are and energized to resist the globalist.
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:25.960]  You simply activate decide you want to start resisting this not to overthrow yourself overnight.
[2:04:25.960 --> 2:04:28.960]  You'll do it by small steps many hands make light work.
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:31.960]  We don't have a choice the children are counting on us let's do it.
[2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:35.960]  They'll speak at city council go run for office call the talk radio.
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:44.960]  Go make blog post go bullhorn the Capitol go in and speak to members of Congress when they're there just take action they're not royalty they work for us.
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:51.960]  You can walk into the Senate walk into the House you go into their offices you can talk to them let them know where we stand you can fall suits against them.
[2:04:51.960 --> 2:04:55.960]  You can teach people how to use firearms you can take people out do stuff.
[2:04:55.960 --> 2:05:07.960]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi automatic rifles and he got all the other Democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero.
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:08.960]  Think about that.
[2:05:08.960 --> 2:05:21.960]  Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:23.960]  They know what they're doing.
[2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:31.960]  And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[2:05:31.960 --> 2:05:35.960]  My goodness ladies and gentlemen this country is under such incredible attack.
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:47.960]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[2:05:47.960 --> 2:05:50.960]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens.
[2:05:50.960 --> 2:06:03.960]  Well we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[2:06:03.960 --> 2:06:06.960]  We're going through the lies and disinformation.
[2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:16.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:16.960 --> 2:06:17.960]  We are live.
[2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:20.960]  Ladies and gentlemen we are broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:25.960]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Friday Black Friday global transmission.
[2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:41.960]  Please remember the establishment is battling around the clock to silence info wars because we are the only multimedia radio TV pro America pro freedom network in the world of its time.
[2:06:41.960 --> 2:06:49.960]  The NRA has basically shut down its multimedia platform because of insider infiltration and other things that are going on.
[2:06:49.960 --> 2:07:04.960]  They want us off the air so that when they bring in total censorship this year and next year if Trump doesn't take action there'll be no one there to challenge their false narratives for race war societal collapse civil war and so much more.
[2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:21.960]  Now there has been a bill introduced to ban Krav Magab, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, kickboxing, Tai Chi, all firearms training in Virginia and again that shows you where all of this is going.
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:29.960]  They want to outlaw citizens being able to defend themselves from antifra from the communist scourge from all the rest of it.
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:38.960]  There are giant packs of communist in black and red mask beating people up attacking buildings where white people live.
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:49.960]  These are white people by the way almost all of them in the in the black mask has been revealed saying that if you have a cat sanctuary in East Austin or you build a new building there that it's gentrification.
[2:07:49.960 --> 2:08:02.960]  They're going to city council members homes and threatening them they're splitting people's heads open in Austin the police indicted one of them and the city drop charges under orders by the prosecutor who's on board with them.
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:12.960]  Once they get the police in place the prosecutors in place they have total reign of terror over you and your only recourse will be defending yourself with deadly force when they try to kill you.
[2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:21.960]  They are so pissed that their Soros funded method devil wars per armies cannot have their way with us and so they are making their move.
[2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:27.960]  Now joining us this hour is E. Michael Jones.
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:40.960]  He was recommended to me off and on a few times and I'd forgotten that even read one of his books years ago, Monsters from the Id and his website is culturewars.com.
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:48.960]  He was a professor and he was removed because he was pro life and he's been massively persecuted.
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:55.960]  He's been a big target of the ADL that's been calling for big text arrest that they don't submit who've been called for my quote purging.
[2:08:55.960 --> 2:09:05.960]  So I wanted to get him on about this big move for total censorship total control but really he's an expert on societal collapse.
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:10.960]  The plan to take our morals away so we can be easily enslaved and controlled.
[2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:15.960]  That's always been known and it was put into an allegory a parable in Pinocchio.
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:31.960]  Back when Hollywood wasn't as corrupt that first big one of the first big Disney films and you notice that the thugs have to trick Pinocchio and his friend to rob some people to break some things.
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:36.960]  And then they're turned into jackasses and loaded on slave ships to go work in mines.
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:46.960]  An allegory for what happens and how the system will induct you into a life of crime like Hollywood and others who today to be able to have you enslaved in a form of modern slavery.
[2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:55.960]  Then the left comes in and says they'll free you all from prison once they put you into their college of criminality are now ready to form their armies of control.
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:57.960]  So we're entering a very dangerous time.
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:04.960]  Please an expert on that as well. I appreciate you Michael Jones of culture wars dot com joining the info war today.
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:09.960]  So sir thanks for coming on with us. You've got the floor here to start wherever you'd like first.
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:11.960]  Thank you Alex.
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:16.960]  We just saw a major move on the part of the ADL just this past week.
[2:10:16.960 --> 2:10:23.960]  They gave an award to Sasha Baron Cohen and he in response gave a speech that I thought was kind of chilling.
[2:10:23.960 --> 2:10:31.960]  He starts demanding that censorship be imposed on the Internet and that the ADL be in charge of the censorship.
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:38.960]  And then he goes on to say if you big tech people don't do it we're going to throw you in jail.
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:51.960]  This was kind of a shocking turn of events by an organization that suddenly is supposed to be put in charge of what we are thinking about what we're allowed to say on the ADL.
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:11:01.960]  I'm sorry what we're allowed to say on the Internet. Who is the ADL. What is this organization. It's an organization that was founded to protect the pedophile.
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:14.960]  The name of the pedophile was Leo Frank. In 1913 he was arrested for sexually molesting and then murdering a 13 year old girl who worked in his pencil factory.
[2:11:14.960 --> 2:11:25.960]  At this point he went on trial. He was found guilty and then a series of attempts to overturn appeals took place.
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:32.960]  The appeals went all the way to the Supreme Court. Every single appeal reaffirmed the original decision.
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:39.960]  And at that point the governor of Georgia commuted his sentence one day before he was leaving office.
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:46.960]  At this point the people of Georgia rose up an army of about 2000 armed men approached the governor's mansion.
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:54.960]  And at that point the governor fled to New York City where the Jewish media basically created him as a hero.
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:12:08.960]  This is an organization that began by protecting the pedophile and then continued in an operation where the main point of this operation was to make sure the Jewish criminals did not go to jail.
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:16.960]  Meyer Lansky as an example of one person I'm talking about gave the ADL a lot of money. It didn't work at that time.
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:24.960]  So then they tried it again with a man by the name of Mo Dallas. Mo Dallas was head of the Jewish Navy in Cleveland during prohibition.
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:35.960]  He went to Covington, Kentucky across from Cincinnati was driven out of town and ended up in Las Vegas, which the Jews had created.
[2:12:35.960 --> 2:12:41.960]  Bugsy Siegel was there. Meyer Lansky had him killed because he wasn't producing fast enough.
[2:12:41.960 --> 2:12:49.960]  And in 1984 the ADL gives Mo Dallas its torches of Liberty Award.
[2:12:49.960 --> 2:12:57.960]  1984 is also the in exchange I have to say in exchange for money. Okay, this is casino money now going to the ADL.
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:13:04.960]  The ADL gives Mo Dallas an award and now from now on if you criticize Mo Dallas, you're an anti-Semite.
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:14.960]  This is the same year that the ADL gets in bed with the FBI. At this point the ADL starts going after people they don't like.
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:26.960]  The FBI is now going after people the ADL doesn't like rather than going after criminals all the way up so they get involved with criminal with prosecution with the police.
[2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:36.960]  And there's a scandal in Los Angeles a couple of years after that where basically the ADL is getting police inside information and it's using it to attack people.
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:51.960]  It goes all the way up to the present. The man who gave Jeffrey Epstein his sweetheart deal which landed him in this kind of executive prison where he had female visitors every day.
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:14:08.960]  That man was given an award by the ADL. So here we've got this organization with this type of past now pushing to the head of the line and saying we are the ones who are going to be in charge of what anyone is allowed to say on the internet.
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:20.960]  Well, I'm sorry this is outrageous. They've gone too far. And I think that the fact that they are now attacking the head of these high tech firms is a sign that they know they've gone too far.
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:34.960]  Now they're pushing the agenda in a way that is going to be counterproductive. But I think we have to know who they are first and then ask ourselves why are these people allowed to determine what we're allowed to say.
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:46.960]  Well, we know I mean we know what's happened. And again I'm not anti Israel. I'm not anti Jewish anything. This is a group set up by mafia knowing that Americans don't want to persecute people for religion or for race or anything.
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:58.960]  To then as you said be a money laundering operation for international mafia international crime to go after anyone that exposes any of these criminal activities. And now this mafia wants to arrest the big tech heads. This is extortion.
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:07.960]  It's a racket. Just like the mafia says I'll burn down your grocery store if you don't pay me protection money. They're saying to Mark Zuckerberg who by the way is Jewish is a Jewish man being threatened with arrest.
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:16.960]  If he doesn't give this group of pirates full control over his company so it's it's a very dangerous mafia just like the Southern probably law center is as well.
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:29.960]  And some of the law center was involved in Oklahoma City bombing Elohim City all that's come out. These groups are tied into foreign intelligence operatives and really now they're in a very viral program they're funding lawsuits against different
[2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:42.960]  groups to try to sue us take us off the air. They are really trying to silence us ahead of something really big. And I think American Jews need to know about this. A lot of which are my listeners so they can speak out against the ADL and say you do not speak for us.
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:53.960]  The Southern probably law center does not speak for liberals in this country as well. E. Michael Jones is our guest. Stay with us as this rain of terror against free speech expands ahead of the election. Will Trump take action.
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:16:04.960]  Attention GCN self reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up. This will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:13.960]  Bill Hyde here. I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[2:16:13.960 --> 2:16:25.960]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi because of the flooding. We've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse.
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:36.960]  We thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at my own power grid dot com.

[2:20:23.960 --> 2:20:33.960]  I want to just remind listeners that without you we will not be on air. We are the main focal point of the attack. Tim Cook was given an award last December by the ADL for quote taking me off the Internet.
[2:20:33.960 --> 2:20:35.960]  Now they've called for my urge.
[2:20:35.960 --> 2:20:38.960]  That's right a program against the info wars.
[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  Very very sad very very frightening very very powerful group that we're standing firm promoting American values unity and justice the things that Martin Luther King Jr.
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:55.960]  Judging people according to their character of their deeds. They call me a white supremacist they call Stephen Miller a white nationalist call for his firing.
[2:20:55.960 --> 2:21:01.960]  It really is defamation by these groups. I'm a Christian. I believe everybody can be saved by Christ.
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:15.960]  But I tell you it's very very dangerous what's going on. Please don't forget we have the biggest sales of the year. This is our biggest sale ever we keep topping the sales but this is as good as it'll ever get triple Patriot points free shipping 50% off is the bare minimum.
[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:27.960]  DNA force plus free shipping 50% off free bottle of brain force plus our great new traffic with that in a bottle of X2 X3 with a free bottle of brain force plus info or store.com so many big sales so many big specials.
[2:21:27.960 --> 2:21:38.960]  It's your purchase funds this info we really need the funds to go into 2020 and fight hard in the election and get around the sensors and really kick butt politically in the third dimension but we need your prayers.
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:54.960]  Read your word of mouth. Tell the folks about the show. You're watching us however you are right now. Tell people about it. That is so critical that overrides the sensors and by the products in four store.com and get Michael Jones books and read them while you still can because this is the age of digital book burning
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:22:09.960]  Merkel in Germany has said get rid of speech to protect freedom. That's a quote. So going back to Michael Jones. This is a shorter segment long segment coming up when you go over the history of the ADL everything you said is historically a fact.
[2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:25.960]  And now they're saying we're going to arrest big tech heads and you know that he was going over the ADL talking points everything he said the ADL has said Sasha Mary Cohen who made his money being a filthy comedian saying throw Jews down wells and trying to get my listeners to kill people he admits.
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:37.960]  I mean this is a monstrous dude who used free speech to hurt America. Now he just wants to take our speech. He's beyond a hypocrite.
[2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:52.960]  What do you think about that Mr. Jones. The problem is you can't object so so they they attack me on one day last week and then I go on another YouTube show and I say look the ADL just attacked me.
[2:22:52.960 --> 2:23:02.960]  This is not fair. I don't think they should have this power over who gets on the Internet or not. So guess what happens that YouTube video gets gets pulled.
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:18.960]  Wait a minute. Can I object to what these people just did to me. Don't I don't have the right to do that. I mean you're going you're going into a situation where no one under any type of legal situation would be allowed to have this type of power.
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:30.960]  And suddenly these people have this power over you can't even object to what they're doing. So I think I think what we're seeing is a pushback because they should have been insiders here in the tech world.
[2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:44.960]  There's a big grant they got in 2017 to team up with all the big players. And why are they saying that they're going to send them to jail. If you're on the inside. Why are you doing this to the people you're working with.
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:54.960]  I think what we're seeing here is pushback. I think that the people the tech people are saying wait a minute. We're the ones who are taking the fall year for these guys. They get all the credit.
[2:23:54.960 --> 2:24:05.960]  They determine what hate speech is. They get to fight their enemies and we get to pay the bill. We're the ones who look bad because we're censoring people dancing to their tune.
[2:24:05.960 --> 2:24:25.960]  I think that notice. Notice. Notice that Sasha Barrett Cohen said nothing is enough. It doesn't matter what you do. You have to let us run everything. They've already brought the ADL Southern Barbery Law Center on literally hundreds of thousands of moderators trained by them.
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:30.960]  And it's all secretive and shadowy and they're in our personal records which the ADL as you said it has been caught stealing police department files. I mean God help us.
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:41.960]  So if you if you at a certain point you're going to have to say no this is enough. We are going to stop. This is completely antithetical to what we hold as Americans completely antithetical.
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:56.960]  If you disagree with these people you're going to go to jail. Well the people who came here didn't come here under those conditions. This is not part of what we're talking about here as part of the last freedoms that we have as Americans.
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:10.960]  We have now people who are trying to pass laws that make you illegal to criticize the state of Israel. Israel can do whatever it ever wants. If you criticize him on a campus in Florida you're going to lose your job.
[2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:19.960]  I'm saying you're they're pushing it too far. There's going to be a reaction. There has to be a reaction to this because that's my next point.
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:29.960]  Dr. Jones is that I I'm pragmatic about this. I know the Islamists would probably all kill each other now the endless war over Jerusalem. I know Israel has a lot of different diverse groups and religious backgrounds.
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:39.960]  People I'm not even against Israel. But then when you're bullied and told you're an anti-Semite and told you're going to be quote purged and then people claim that they speak for all Jews.
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:45.960]  I have to say to that group no you don't. And you're the closest thing to Hitler I've ever seen.
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:55.960]  Yeah that's that's the problem here. They take this extreme position. They take it in the name of Jews and then all Jews have to bear the burden of what they've done.
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:26:04.960]  This isn't fair. This isn't fair to the Jews. And if if these people do not represent the Jews and the Jews are going to stand up and say no.
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:20.960]  Now this there this you can't have it both ways. OK. You can't have this type of basically tyrannical rule over the Internet and then say well we're a private organization even though you basically have the force of law.
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:31.960]  You can overturn laws. That's we've entered a new era of history where basically the oligarchs can if they want to overturn your law they bring in the shock troops.
[2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:42.960]  Mainly the groups like the homosexual activists that overturned the law in the state of Indiana. They're doing the same thing in Ireland and they're doing the same thing at Silicon Valley.
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:53.960]  So we're in a war. There's no news to you. But I mean we're in a war. And these are one of the people who are the directors of that warfare against the people of the United States of America.
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:27:09.960]  And now the Internet's gone from being millions of diverse sides to six having ninety six percent control. We're now in a Panopticon prison being spied on with leftist wardens in all our personal messages all our data we've invested all our
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:19.960]  promotion into their platforms. And now they're saying we have no speech and now they're coming after the few platforms they don't control. This is a very dangerous combination of evil.
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  Yeah. And that's why we have to stand up to it right now. So we're going to see is this is not in the interest of Silicon Valley to go along with this.
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:42.960]  Well I mean I totally agree with you that a Rubicon has been has been crossed here. This is this is super dangerous for everybody. This is war. This is pushing it into the streets. This is not going to go well.
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:56.960]  Yeah. I mean I just did an article on Ireland. Ireland was conquered. It was conquered by a combination of of multinational firms tax exempt foundations and big tech like Google and Facebook.
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:28:06.960]  They didn't need an army. They just come in there. They got a beachhead because of low taxes. They invited all these firms in and then suddenly their firms are telling him you have to overturn the
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:18.960]  constitution of Ireland. So the first thing they did with the family, then they gave them homosexual marriage and then the last referendum was on abortion. All of those rights were just taken out of the Irish
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:31.960]  Constitution. And then now it's let grown men hate speech. And now it's let grown men hate speech in Ireland. They're going they're going to remove the freedom of speech that's in the Irish
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:44.960]  Constitution. This is the way war is waged in our day. Exactly. This is how war is waged and the new sacrament is full grown men with our children. The next booty they're demanding literally is our
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:52.960]  children. If we put up with that we'll put with anything. Stay there. We'll come back and talk about the hate speech laws of Europe now about to be passed here and Americans to be arrested by the
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:29:04.960]  millions prepared. Attention GCN self reliance listeners. If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up. This will be the most important message you'll ever

[2:31:54.960 --> 2:32:09.960]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines more than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:28.960]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told general were completely surrounded he said good we can attack in all directions well that's the point that info wars has reached and it really is epic it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:39.960]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete and it's not just Americans but folks all over the world are completely silenced.
[2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:56.960]  When it comes to speak in the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines because by info wars having its own platform that checkmates the globalist.
[2:32:56.960 --> 2:33:12.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:12.960 --> 2:33:20.960]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:26.960]  You know there's not really a way to be more animated about this.
[2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:31.960]  I mean this is so un-American so authoritarian.
[2:33:31.960 --> 2:33:42.960]  And then you know they call everybody a Nazi that doesn't agree with communism with socialism with sexualization of children and the ADL comes out and brands Trump in a speech.
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:54.960]  Stephen Miller Alex Jones Breitbart is Nazis I mean Stephen Miller is a conservative Jewish guy that's pro-Israel and they say he is a white nationalist he's be taken off the air and he's be fired by Trump.
[2:33:54.960 --> 2:34:01.960]  And then they start getting what they want and then you look at the ADL and it's such a criminal organization.
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:05.960]  Literally run by the Jewish mafia.
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:14.960]  And then the media always spends it Jones claims Jews are a mafia. No the Irish have mafia is the Russians have mafia is the Jews have a mafia.
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.960]  The Italians have mafia.
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:19.960]  There's the Dixie mafia in the south of the US.
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:23.960]  We call the wasp lead aristocracy in America.
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:28.960]  You know the ruling class that's a mafia skull and bones is a mafia CIA is a mafia.
[2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:36.960]  But the ADL imagine if the Scientologists were out doing stuff like this I'd be after him.
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:44.960]  I mean just just you think of the Scientologists got up to the speech and said we're going to arrest have the big tech heads arrested if they don't turn themselves over to Scientology.
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:47.960]  Well the Scientologists would be arrested in about a week.
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:49.960]  That's mafia tactics.
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:53.960]  So that's a cult get them stop them that's dangerous.
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:58.960]  But when the ADL says they're going to destroy you if you don't submit we bend over.
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:02.960]  Well I'm done bending over ladies and gentlemen I've tried to stay out of this.
[2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:09.960]  I'm trying to just unify Americans around freedom and justice and I don't care if you're old young black white Jewish whatever.
[2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:16.960]  If you care about freedom and you believe in the Bill of Rights Constitution and you like the free market and you're great.
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:18.960]  And then hopefully you don't want to kill babies.
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:29.960]  But our guest E. Michael Jones was a university academic coming in professor and he got removed at a Catholic University because he was pro life.
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:30.960]  That was decades ago.
[2:35:30.960 --> 2:35:34.960]  That's where this reign of tyranny is ladies and gentlemen.
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:37.960]  That's where it is.
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:42.960]  And we need to get upset and motivated but Americans are so used to.
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:44.960]  Oh don't want me to say the n word.
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:46.960]  Sure I'm not saying n word anyways.
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:48.960]  Then it's oh don't say homosexual.
[2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:54.960]  That's a scientific name for it like heterosexual but OK I've hurt your feelings I won't do that.
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:56.960]  And then it's don't say mother or father.
[2:35:56.960 --> 2:35:57.960]  Don't say they're two genders.
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:35:58.960]  Don't say America should exist.
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:35:59.960]  Don't say illegal alien.
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:00.960]  Do what we say.
[2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:01.960]  Do what we say.
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:02.960]  Do what we say.
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:10.960]  And our guest points out the shock troops aren't the gay lobby now the homosexual lobby it's the pedo lobby.
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:20.960]  And the last frontier give us control your children public schools in Texas say parents will have a right to know when men dress as women come have their elementary students so in our labs that's in the news today.
[2:36:20.960 --> 2:36:27.960]  We're going to have time alone with your kids without you knowing same group took over the Catholic church same groups taken over the Boy Scouts.
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:29.960]  It's a pedophile ring.
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:33.960]  And so E. Michael Jones you were explaining we're in a war.
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:41.960]  The war is here and now it's the hate speech laws and now it's being introduced by the ADL and American soil.
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:45.960]  We're going to arrest anybody that doesn't do what we say.
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:51.960]  And if you point out that these groups are staging hate crimes against themselves we're going to arrest you for that too.
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:53.960]  That's what that's what's happening here.
[2:36:53.960 --> 2:36:55.960]  So please continue.
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:37:02.960]  Yeah I mean you're right it is a war and in order to understand it you have to take it back to the end of the Second World War.
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:05.960]  Germany is a conquered country.
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:10.960]  We have complete United States has complete control over whatever goes on there.
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:14.960]  And the first plan is basically the Morgenthau plan.
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:16.960]  They're going to starve the Germans to death.
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:24.960]  And at that point the the the adults in the room realize well we need Germany against the communists OK.
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:30.960]  So they introduced the Marshall plan and this is the beginning of social engineering.
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:32.960]  All right this is warfare.
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:34.960]  This is psychological warfare.
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:36.960]  We call it social engineering.
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:40.960]  We are going to take complete control over the flow of information in Germany.
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:48.960]  This means that any book any newspaper any play any TV show any movie has to get a license.
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:56.960]  It gets a license from a man by the name of David Mardekai Levy who was a Jewish psychiatrist from New York City.
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:02.960]  He hands out the licenses and therefore they determine the flow of information.
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:04.960]  At the same time this is happening.
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:13.960]  Germany is now flooded with pornography flooded with material as soon as the valons reform took place as soon as they got the currency reform.
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:20.960]  The pornography came in tons of it come in from Austria and the place is flooded with pornography.
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:30.960]  The church objects and over this period of time you have a battle for the mind of the German people being seduced by sexual liberation.
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:37.960]  It gets more and more intense over this period of time until you reach the 70s when it's the movies.
[2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:39.960]  This is when I was in Germany.
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:49.960]  I was a teacher at a gymnasium in Germany and the girls that are coming into class here are holding a magazine called Bravo which is for
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:51.960]  for teens.
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:39:00.960]  There's an advice column by a man by the name of Dr. Somer whose real name is Martin Weinstein and he's teaching the girls how to masturbate.
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:02.960]  This all happened in Germany.
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:11.960]  It was all part of the psychological warfare campaign that was orchestrated by the United States government to destroy the morals of the German people.
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:18.960]  And if you want to look at what happened in Germany.
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:22.960]  Dr. I want you to have the floor and I'll have you back again soon because you're right on about this.
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:26.960]  I want to explain to new viewers and new listeners or liberals that will make a joke about this.
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:30.960]  We're not scared of women and we're not scared of sex.
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:33.960]  The point is this is a real psychological warfare plan.
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:43.960]  George Arwell wrote about it in 1984 because he saw the plan as a top propagandist in OSS and then MI6 and that was later declassified.
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:48.960]  To totally break down society and in the family.
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:50.960]  And that's what he wrote about in 1984.
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:58.960]  So this early sexualization and all this is about people not developing the higher centers of their brains and having dreams.
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:05.960]  It's about destroying them while they're young destroying their innocence so they don't have time to flower and fully develop.
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:07.960]  That's why they're now targeting in the U.S.
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:14.960]  And saying we're going to teach your children how to masturbate at age five sexualization of children pedophilia and you're not going to stop us.
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:18.960]  So it's again a psychological warfare plan developed.
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:19.960]  So break it down.
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:24.960]  Explain how Germany was the model that it was done a few decades later here in the 60s.
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:25.960]  Please continue.
[2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:26.960]  Yeah.
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:34.960]  I mean basically what they saw they realized they were extremely successful in Germany when I got there in the early 70s teaching there.
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:37.960]  They had movies like the Shulmation report.
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:38.960]  You know.
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:41.960]  And it's all this quasi scientific stuff.
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:44.960]  The crucial figure in Germany was Alfred Kinsey.
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:50.960]  Alfred Kinsey was the sexologist the bug doctor from Indiana University.
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:54.960]  He was got funding by the Rockefeller as he came out with the Kinsey report.
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:58.960]  And at this point the word report entered the German language.
[2:40:58.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  It's not a German word.
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:00.960]  The German word is Bericht.
[2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  But all the magazines started promoting this and you had the ore of science.
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:11.960]  And then when it passed in Germany when they succumbed to it then it got brought back over here 10 years later.
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:25.960]  So what started in the 50s in Germany ended up in the 60s in the United States as basically they eroded all of the traditional guard guard rails again protecting sexual morality in this country.
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:28.960]  The beginning of the introduction of pornography.
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:30.960]  Let's be clear.
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:34.960]  All of those all those famous psychologists admitted they were into pedophilia.
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:36.960]  They were into everything.
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  You know one of the famous ones locked his son in a box for most of his life.
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:43.960]  I mean these are monstrous people.
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:44.960]  One of them wrote the book.
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:47.960]  I forget who wrote it beyond evil.
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:51.960]  I mean I mean I mean these guys are literally monsters.
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:58.960]  Judith Riesma was a Jewish psychologist and she exposed the Kinsey report.
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:07.960]  There was a whole graph there a whole table there of children being brought to orgasm.
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:08.960]  Well that's a crime.
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:10.960]  That's criminal activity.
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:14.960]  How come nobody noticed this the Kinsey was involved in some type of criminal activity.
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:16.960]  She was the one who brought it up.
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  At that point Kinsey's Kinsey's star started to fade and then James Jones came out with
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:28.960]  the biography and it turns out Kinsey's a homosexual and so he's got an axe to grind
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:30.960]  in this whole operation.
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:32.960]  So that that's right.
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:35.960]  Kinsey was a pedophile and we're going to come back and talk about that.
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:40.960]  And so this is a pedophile cult and it'll take anything over and people need to understand it
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:41.960]  and talk about their in game.

[2:43:56.960 --> 2:44:06.960]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson what is the level of tyranny that a tyrant
[2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:12.960]  will take humanity to how far will they go what's their limit and he said it is the limit
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:21.960]  to which other men and women will submit the answer is there is no limit to evil it is
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:23.960]  a bottomless pit.
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:29.960]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no
[2:44:29.960 --> 2:44:34.960]  free will there's no devil or the god but those very same people have all these rules
[2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:41.960]  for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:47.960]  be like they just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us oxford's band

[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:06.960]  globalist leftist anti-american organizations on the face of the planet and they have declared
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:13.960]  that info wars is public enemy number one they gave tim cook of apple an award specifically

[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:26.960]  and now they've had Sasha barat cohen come out and call for the arrest of big tech heads
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:32.960]  that do not turn full control over to the globalist adl and they've called for a complete
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:38.960]  purge of anyone promoting americana we are being demoralized we are being conquered and
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:43.960]  the enemy wants to shut info wars down because they understand that we've got their number

[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:23.960]  to the alex jones show
[2:47:23.960 --> 2:47:30.960]  pornography as a weapon you know they have no nut no member it's getting really popular
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:35.960]  with men and women to not masturbate people are finding it's destroying their quality
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:41.960]  of life it's taking their essence away literally making fun of general jack t ripper in dr strange
[2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:46.960]  love hey you really need your fluoride and hey you really need to let go of your essence
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:51.960]  what's the psychology joke there what are we being told by Stanley Kubrick because there's
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:55.960]  something a lot deeper there why don't boxers have sex for a few weeks before they have a boxing
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:48:01.960]  match what's what's going on here ladies and gentlemen we're going over all of it today
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:07.960]  with a michael jones culture wars dot com want to invite him back to get more into the culture
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:15.960]  wars more into the sexualization of children while this is being done it's an exact formulae
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:19.960]  and now it's the trendiest thing with all the big corporate media saying take your son chop his
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:25.960]  genitals off that's not child abuse if the Aztecs did it we'd call them psychotics a thousand
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:30.960]  years ago but we do it it's liberal and it's trendy this is true institutionalized pedophilia
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:36.960]  and dismembering of children going on what's at the bottom of the rat hole where is all this
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:44.960]  going dr jones yeah you're right it's a weapon pornography is a weapon and this became clear
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:52.960]  when the Israelis invaded remala in 2002 they come into town they take over the TV stations
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:57.960]  and they start broadcasting pornography now wait a minute I thought pornography was freedom
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:02.960]  I thought it meant freedom so does this mean the Israelis want to bring freedom to the palestinians
[2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:08.960]  no this proves that it's a weapon okay that it subjugates the people it's supposed to derail
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:14.960]  them it's supposed to derange them and it's also supposed to block any type of rational
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:22.960]  response to what's going on I gave this talk it began to talk with that incident in Europe
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:27.960]  like in the United States I had Palestinians come up to me and tell me it was worse than I
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:32.960]  even talked about because there were snipers on top of the hospital in remala and if people
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:37.960]  came out they they couldn't come out of doors because they'd be shot so the only source of
[2:49:37.960 --> 2:49:43.960]  information they have is the television and there it is it's pornography okay this generation
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:49.960]  okay the generation of 20 year olds have been raised with pornography on their phones they
[2:49:49.960 --> 2:49:55.960]  have unlimited access to pornography and at a certain point they realized that something
[2:49:55.960 --> 2:50:01.960]  was wrong here and I wrote a book it's called libido dominante sexual liberation and political
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:08.960]  control and in a sense all I had to say was sexual liberation is a form of political control
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:14.960]  and everybody understood me because they were already slaves to their passions they were already
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:20.960]  addicted to pornography they already had a bad masturbation well I mean but pornography
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:28.960]  they started to work against it it ruins sexuality it ruins the real thing absolutely
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:33.960]  absolutely so they said well we're going to take back we're going to take back our own minds
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:37.960]  we're going to take back our own bodies we're going to take control of our lives rational
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:44.960]  moral control of our lives and they organized this boycott well guess what the pornographers
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:50.960]  are upset the people who instituted this regime are upset and there was an actually an article
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:59.960]  in Rolling Stone in which the author says that these people are anti-semites if you don't
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:06.960]  masturbate if you boycott pornography you're an anti-semite I didn't make this up okay this is
[2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:14.960]  in that Rolling Stone article so what you're seeing here in general is the oligarchs losing
[2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:21.960]  control of the narrative one of the most powerful subjugating narratives of our time was pornography
[2:51:21.960 --> 2:51:27.960]  it made an entire generation docile to the commands of their rulers and now people are
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:33.960]  waking up to understand that sexual liberation is a form of control and they don't like it
[2:51:33.960 --> 2:51:39.960]  and they're breaking up their own chains and escaping from the jail that the culture has
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:44.960]  created for them and it's beautiful because people realize that they're getting outside again
[2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:49.960]  they're getting away from their phones they're realizing all of this is meant to give you
[2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:54.960]  fake satisfaction so you don't go out and form real relationships and people are finding it's
[2:51:54.960 --> 2:52:00.960]  the real relationships it's the real world that are actually going to form that yes and why are
[2:52:00.960 --> 2:52:05.960]  why are 20 year olds especially being targeted because this is the time in your life when you
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:11.960]  form real relationships the most important relationship you will have in your life is
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:18.960]  marriage that because you are trying to link in your life with another person and that person
[2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:23.960]  is going to you're going to enter into a fertile union that will create people for the next
[2:52:23.960 --> 2:52:29.960]  generation and that's how that's what builds the civilization that's what builds people having
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:35.960]  relationships being honorable being fulfilled they want you atomized alone all by yourself
[2:52:35.960 --> 2:52:41.960]  depressed where they can control you Facebook documents even admit that yes the best and
[2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:46.960]  it's also Wilhelm Reich if you want to talk about the man who cooked up this idea he wrote
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:55.960]  a book called the mass psychology of fascism in the 1930s he was a psychiatrist a student of
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:53:01.960]  Sigmund Freud also a communist nobody I explain to people Hitler Hitler wanted sexual
[2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:05.960]  liberation and they use porn and stuff as well and wanted men to have a whole bunch of
[2:53:05.960 --> 2:53:13.960]  relationships why is that why the fascist wanted as well one of the one of the books that
[2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:19.960]  Hitler burned were the books of Magnus Hirschfeld Magnus Hirschfeld was the head of it was a
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:26.960]  Jew who was the head of the Institute for sex while this and shaft and if he didn't exist
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:33.960]  Hitler would have to create him this was the type of abuse in Germany a conquered country
[2:53:33.960 --> 2:53:38.960]  after World War one suddenly these people are let loose people like Magnus Hirschfeld
[2:53:38.960 --> 2:53:43.960]  are let loose and suddenly the people are resentful they don't want the corruption of
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:47.960]  their morals and they turn to somebody like Hitler because he said he would straighten
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:52.960]  them out now this this this it could have happened to could have been stopped earlier
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:57.960]  the uncle of Pope Benedict the great uncle of Pope Benedict wrote a book called
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:54:04.960]  judicious a verbsleben Georg Rossinger and he said if the church doesn't step in and
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:10.960]  defend the people by enforcing the laws to protect the moral order the pure German people
[2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:16.960]  going to look for a leader well guess what the German word for leader is it's fear and
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:21.960]  they found it they found their leader this is the type of reaction we want to prevent
[2:54:21.960 --> 2:54:28.960]  here in America and the way we prevent this is by open dialogue and able to where we're
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:37.960]  able to to criticize the people who have subjected us to this reign of pornographic terror
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:43.960]  well dr. Jones with the it's going to get worse with the left and their final hunger
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  across the board is children the ADL says let fat men dress as clowns have access to
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:54.960]  your children the southern primary law center says that's a particular sacrament is unannounced
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:55:00.960]  fat men generally dresses clowns having children so in their laps then they exchange contact
[2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:06.960]  numbers with them literally letting obese pedophiles and others have access to your
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:10.960]  children now in Texas they're saying they're going to have access parents aren't going
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:16.960]  to know quote some of you don't know what's best for your kids this is the new sacrament
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:20.960]  what do you expect to come next I mean is this just meant to see what we'll put up with
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:26.960]  no I expect a reaction this is the way God works in human history you let something go
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:33.960]  too far and then suddenly there's a reaction so you let the whole agenda of sex education
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:38.960]  the first generation of sex education you make it mandatory in the schools and what did
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:43.960]  you do you created the home schooling movement in places like like Indiana across the United
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:48.960]  States I was involved in this in the 1980s when my children were small at that time you
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:52.960]  were thinking maybe I'm going to get arrested because my kids not going to school well we
[2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:57.960]  won that battle that battle was one and now in the state of Indiana the state will give

[2:59:49.960 --> 3:00:02.960]  show the globalist great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity they end up
[3:00:02.960 --> 3:00:10.960]  on top the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them on our journey
[3:00:10.960 --> 3:00:23.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show all right paul joseph watch that's taken over some
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:28.960]  upset that london bridge terrace to adjust stabbed numerous people was killed by police
[3:00:28.960 --> 3:00:33.960]  that's coming up also gretta thunberg now worshiped as a god in european schools the
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:38.960]  children are then mounted to computers and told to battle online promoting her as part
[3:00:38.960 --> 3:00:45.960]  of going to school giant murals of her being painted everywhere that's coming up next segment
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:52.960]  talk about creepiness the michael jones the left is also using weaponized islam incompatible
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:57.960]  with the west but as you said it's the islamicist saying no to the pedophile trainings that seems
[3:00:57.960 --> 3:01:04.960]  to be going caddy wampus or derailing some of the left's operations the left is not invincible
[3:01:04.960 --> 3:01:10.960]  now from my experience they're satanic compulsions they try to codify that into a political plan
[3:01:10.960 --> 3:01:16.960]  but as you said all they ever do is summon their own destruction though that's summon
[3:01:16.960 --> 3:01:21.960]  destruction normally wrecked civilization as well so i can see what you're saying that
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:27.960]  the wrath of god like giant thunder heads rolling in and a typhoon towards the shore isn't long
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:33.960]  from colliding into civilization look it's good news it's not bad news it's good news
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:40.960]  because god is in charge of human history and he he brings he constantly brings good
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:47.960]  out of evil and so one of the best examples is this this whole flooding of of europe with
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:53.960]  these islamic immigrants whose background is just not compatible with the dominant culture
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:58.960]  in these european countries so they come to a place like london they take over the neighborhood
[3:01:58.960 --> 3:02:04.960]  and then suddenly the schools try to teach sex ed and suddenly the muslims react and
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  they don't like it and now there's a protest so it backfired on them this is the way god
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:14.960]  works in human history he takes evil and he turns it into good just the way he did in
[3:02:14.960 --> 3:02:21.960]  joseph's life in the bible you're absolutely right the lord works in mysterious ways and
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  now that i've had time to see how god works it's it's it's going to be get your popcorn
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:32.960]  out folks because the next few years dot level we got a few minutes left what do you expect
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:38.960]  next what do you think about the election what do you think about trump not acting on censorship
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:44.960]  i was in south bend indiana when donald trump arrived it was the biggest biggest assembly
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:49.960]  biggest group of people ever in the history of south bend and they all were there and
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:54.960]  they all had one thing in common they all recognize that there were two parties that
[3:02:54.960 --> 3:03:00.960]  supported the oligarchs and no party that supported the people of indiana and that's
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  why they voted for donald trump the biggest cheer of the night came when donald trump
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:10.960]  talked about carrier air conditioning sending his plant to mexico these are the people that
[3:03:10.960 --> 3:03:14.960]  put donald trump in office and the minute he got into office the deep state has been
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:19.960]  trying to remove him and so what we have here is one more attempt now the impeachment where
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:25.960]  the oligarchs want to overturn the verdict of the people i mean trump has made lots of
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:30.960]  mistakes but that doesn't change the fact that that's what's going on right now time after
[3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:35.960]  time we had it in indiana before with the religious freedom restoration act when the
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:40.960]  people the representatives of indiana passed a law that said you cannot chorus people to
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:46.960]  bake cakes for gay weddings as soon as the governor signed the ink wasn't even dry and
[3:03:46.960 --> 3:03:52.960]  then the oligarchs descended on indianapolis and said you've got to change your law the
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:58.960]  ceo of sales wars elie lily all the big oligarchs came in and overturned representative
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:03.960]  government this is what notice the left wants to make us all the left wants all its rights
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:07.960]  but we never have any rights these people want total control and total power they're
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:12.960]  going to lose please come back again soon to get more into the decline of civilization
[3:04:12.960 --> 3:04:17.960]  and what you think is coming in the future e michael jones culture wars dot com thank
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:23.960]  you for joining us thank you all right folks well that was a very informative interview
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:28.960]  paul joseph watson is coming up recommend more host you'd like us to have on its show

[3:04:38.960 --> 3:04:43.960]  so look the special reports at bandot video and why feeds bandot video whatever you do
[3:04:43.960 --> 3:04:48.960]  share that link the globalist can't stand it once we archive this interview just heard
[3:04:48.960 --> 3:04:54.960]  please share that all watson's coming up please tell folks he's coming up i've made a lot of
[3:04:54.960 --> 3:04:59.960]  predictions that have come true but i'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't
[3:04:59.960 --> 3:05:04.960]  predictions that came out of a crystal ball i could see where the globalists were going
[3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:10.960]  i could see what their in-game agenda was what their goal was and i knew that when they
[3:05:10.960 --> 3:05:14.960]  were setting us up to be deplatformed that they were really setting the precedent to
[3:05:14.960 --> 3:05:22.960]  take everybody off air to to silence everyone to ban words and names and information on
[3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:28.960]  fake whistleblowers so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed but the globalists really
[3:05:28.960 --> 3:05:35.960]  feared was independent media and platforms in the future it was the model of info wars as
[3:05:35.960 --> 3:05:41.960]  much as the information that had to be silenced because they need total information dominance
[3:05:41.960 --> 3:05:45.960]  for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed and that's why keeping
[3:05:45.960 --> 3:05:59.960]  info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever lie from london england
[3:05:59.960 --> 3:06:10.960]  it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news well today we had a austere religious scholar
[3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:15.960]  committing an act of peace in london now it appears as if there's been another stabbing
[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:20.960]  in the haig in the netherlands headline multiple people stabbed on shopping street in the haig
[3:06:20.960 --> 3:06:26.960]  as out of bnl at bnl news multiple people have been injured in a stabbing incident on
[3:06:26.960 --> 3:06:30.960]  shopping street in the haig dutch officials say major incident has been declared but details
[3:06:30.960 --> 3:06:35.960]  are still limited the incident began at 7 45 p.m. on friday when police and other emergency
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:40.960]  services were called for a stabbing incident at on your Hudson's bay in the city centre
[3:06:40.960 --> 3:06:46.960]  multiple ambulances responded to the scene they're saying there's at least three injured
[3:06:46.960 --> 3:06:53.960]  people there in the haig so we'll continue to look at that the latest on the london incident
[3:06:53.960 --> 3:06:58.960]  with the attacker having not been named of course this occurred earlier this afternoon
[3:06:58.960 --> 3:07:04.960]  there were reports of a stabbing in premises nearby london bridge the police rushed to the
[3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:10.960]  scene it appeared as if the attacker had fled to london bridge itself there he was tackled
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:17.960]  by a group of brave passersby and then when the firearms police arrived he was double
[3:07:17.960 --> 3:07:22.960]  tapped in the head and shot dead people are very upset about that on the left which we'll
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:27.960]  get to in a moment but the latest out of bbc news is london bridge two killed in stabbing
[3:07:27.960 --> 3:07:32.960]  attack two members of the public have died after a stabbing attack at london bridge in
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:37.960]  which police also shot dead the suspect I saw a picture of one of the victims hours
[3:07:37.960 --> 3:07:42.960]  ago and she didn't look in a great state so I presume that she was one of those victims
[3:07:42.960 --> 3:07:47.960]  who was unfortunately died met police declared the attack a terrorist incident the suspect
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:52.960]  who died at the scene was believed to have been wearing a hoax explosive device videos
[3:07:52.960 --> 3:07:57.960]  on social media appeared show passes by holding down a man an officer arrived seems to indicate
[3:07:57.960 --> 3:08:02.960]  the group to move and fires a shot you've probably seen that video by now it's all over twitter
[3:08:02.960 --> 3:08:10.960]  and now you're seeing it on screen right now so the terrorist shot dead but only unfortunately
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:15.960]  after he appears to have killed two members of the public again it probably would have
[3:08:15.960 --> 3:08:21.960]  been a bigger attack if those members of the public the ones who are passing by had not
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:28.960]  tackled him the whole way in which the terrorists was neutralized has upset a lot of people
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:33.960]  they're not happy that this bloodthirsty terrorist who'd been running around screaming stabbing
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:39.960]  people while wearing a fake explosives vest which of course the police did not know that
[3:08:39.960 --> 3:08:44.960]  it was fake at the time just as they were wearing fake explosive vests in the previous
[3:08:44.960 --> 3:08:50.960]  london bridge attack back in 2017 where dozens of people were injured and I think it was 11
[3:08:50.960 --> 3:08:56.960]  people eventually who died and we're going to get into the line of london bridge who of
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:01.960]  course was later put on the right wing extremist terrorist watch list after he tackled one of
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:06.960]  the terrorists remains to be seen if that's going to happen again headline up on summit
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:12.960]  dot news some upset that london bridge terrorists who had just stabbed numerous people was killed
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:19.960]  by police and these are real comments I screenshot a couple of them knowing that they'd been deleted
[3:09:19.960 --> 3:09:24.960]  in fact one's been deleted I embedded since I embedded it in this article because that's
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:29.960]  what they always do some people are upset that the london bridge terrorists and that's
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:35.960]  by the way I tweeted about this earlier because I saw the comments before I wrote this article
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:40.960]  and then people responded like oh you've seen these comments of people claiming the terrorists
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:46.960]  should been arrested where are they well if you respond to them on Twitter then they immediately
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:51.960]  delete the tweets and lock down their accounts and I did post screenshots later on which are in
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:55.960]  this article some people are upset london bridge terrorists who was wearing a fake explosives
[3:09:55.960 --> 3:10:00.960]  vest and had stabbed multiple victims with shot dead by police arguing they should have been
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:06.960]  arrested because he was really complying wasn't he with literally like five people on top of him
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:12.960]  still struggling wearing a bomb vest police didn't know it was fake at the time the attack
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:17.960]  was apprehended by brave citizens who disarmed him of his weapon before police moved into gun
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:25.960]  down the assailant in fact the image of one of those individuals with the knife a really
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:30.960]  massive knife disarmed from the victim taking it away from the scene has gone viral on Twitter
[3:10:30.960 --> 3:10:35.960]  he's for the moment being held as a hero but given the track record maybe he'll be put
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:41.960]  on a terrorist watch list if he's not careful but the fact that the assailant was gunned
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:47.960]  down disturbed numerous leftists on Twitter who were upset that the terrorist was killed
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:54.960]  once said by the name of Hassan Nawaz wonder what religion he practices how can they shoot
[3:10:54.960 --> 3:11:01.960]  one man publicly they could have arrested or use rubber bullets he labeled it madness
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:07.960]  yes it was complete madness that this screaming maniac who had just knifed numerous people
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:15.960]  and killed two while wearing what police thought was a bomb vest was killed that's madness
[3:11:15.960 --> 3:11:21.960]  another said was there any need for the police to kill the man this was Laura Whitehawk
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:26.960]  who added they could have easily arrested him but murdered him instead state murder doesn't
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:35.960]  sit well with me says Laura Whitehawk with the LGBT rainbow flag on her profile meanwhile
[3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:41.960]  Twitter user called skid Row radio who has an image of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:47.960]  his profile said this everyone already knows the shooting was clearly reckless and unnecessary
[3:11:47.960 --> 3:11:53.960]  he could easily be arrested while he also suggested the incident was suspicious because
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:58.960]  it helped Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson well it doesn't really help Johnson
[3:11:58.960 --> 3:12:03.960]  because every time this kind of thing happens Labour just comes out and said well the Tories
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:08.960]  didn't allocate enough money for police so this is why these attacks are happening that's
[3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:16.960]  not really going to wash given the rapid response of the police in this example but again another
[3:12:16.960 --> 3:12:21.960]  individual on Twitter lamenting the fact that the terrorist is dead somebody with Jeremy Corbyn
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:28.960]  in his profile another Twitter user who has now deleted his tweet after I embedded in this
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:36.960]  article said the police could have easily arrested him not shoot him in the nuts again a fan of
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:42.960]  Jeremy Corbyn which is interesting because Jeremy Corbyn got some heat last month or in
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:48.960]  fact it was earlier this month when the leader of the terror group ISIS was killed by US
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:56.960]  special forces Jeremy Corbyn the later Labour leader came out and said that it was wrong to
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:02.960]  have killed him and that detaining him would have been quote the right thing to do so you
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:09.960]  got the leader of ISIS hold up again putting at risk the lives of the US special forces
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:16.960]  this is a guy who I presume is not going to go quietly Jeremy Corbyn the Labour leader
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:23.960]  who on numerous occasions shared a platform with actual ISIS supporters back in 2014
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:29.960]  the guy who has shown sympathy for terrorists across the globe he was upset that Baghdadi
[3:13:29.960 --> 3:13:35.960]  was killed and now it appears that many of his supporters on Twitter are upset that this
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:43.960]  terrorist was killed in London today by the way the brave citizens who tackled the terrorists
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:48.960]  ignored the advice of police who after the previous London Bridge attack near Borough
[3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:54.960]  market and in fact in and around Borough market again way more deadly back in 2017 they warned
[3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:59.960]  the public after that attack in the event of a weapons or firearms attack so I presume
[3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:08.960]  that means guns or knives they told the public to quote run hide and tell the brave citizens
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:13.960]  on London Bridge did not follow that advice and that's why the terrorists was killed very
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:21.960]  quickly again I presume many of the supporters of Jeremy Corbyn were not happy that people
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:27.960]  didn't run hide and tell and the unfortunate reality of this is that London is extremely
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:32.960]  prepared for people being stabbed because we've had a knife crime epidemic for the last
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:38.960]  three years which continues to so in fact I had this article up on summit news about
[3:14:38.960 --> 3:14:44.960]  ten days ago 320 bleed control kits to be given to bars in London these were handed
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:50.960]  out to bars in the city of London which is like a square mile within the city of London
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:57.960]  itself because knife crime in the city of London jumped by 43% in the last year during
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:02.960]  the same time period England saw a record high of 43,000 knife crimes across the country
[3:15:02.960 --> 3:15:13.960]  we are very much used to this funny thing about it is don't tend to see 320 bleed control
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:21.960]  kits being handed out to bars in cities like Warsaw Poland or cities like Budapest Hungary
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:27.960]  don't recall seeing many diversity barriers or diversity bollards on the streets on the
[3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:37.960]  streets of Warsaw very interesting to compare and contrast the two isn't it something missing
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:41.960]  Warsaw's missing something can't quite put my finger on it we're going to get back into
[3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:46.960]  this and more after the break see what's going on with that knife attack in the Hague Netherlands

[3:19:54.960 --> 3:20:03.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:13.960]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:19.960]  so we had what looks like an austere religious scholar committing an act of peace on london bridge
[3:20:19.960 --> 3:20:24.960]  he was tackled by brave citizens who disarmed him of his what they're calling a zombie knife
[3:20:24.960 --> 3:20:30.960]  and pictures of the primary individual who did so are going viral on twitter
[3:20:30.960 --> 3:20:37.960]  should we fear for his future reputation given what happened after the previous london bridge attack back in 2017
[3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:43.960]  and we're talking about an article which was up on summit dot news back in july entitled
[3:20:43.960 --> 3:20:48.960]  man who bravely fought off islamic terrorists is put on terror watch list by uk government
[3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:54.960]  this was the lion of london bridge a 49 year old man called roy larner
[3:20:54.960 --> 3:21:01.960]  who bravely fought off islamic terrorists back in 2017 and was later put on an anti radicalization terror watch list
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:07.960]  by the uk government over fears he could become a right-wing extremist
[3:21:07.960 --> 3:21:11.960]  and i spoke about this earlier on the show with alex
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:17.960]  there are actually videos from the 2017 london bridge attack borough market attack
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:23.960]  where people are hiding at the back of a restaurant or a bar while the attack is taking place
[3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:26.960]  while people are being stabbed to death
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:33.960]  and one individual shouts out i can't remember the exact words but it's something to the effect of effing muslims
[3:21:33.960 --> 3:21:39.960]  and the guy nearby reprimands him for being politically incorrect
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:44.960]  by suggesting that it was an islamic terror attack when it was obviously an islamic terror attack
[3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:49.960]  that is the level of absolute clown world insanity that we're dealing with
[3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:56.960]  when during the very process of a terror attack when people are being knifed to death by islamic terrorists
[3:21:56.960 --> 3:22:01.960]  somebody who dares suggest that it might be an islamic terrorist attack that's taking place
[3:22:01.960 --> 3:22:05.960]  is reprimanded for being politically incorrect
[3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:11.960]  roy larner wasn't being politically incorrect when he screamed f u i millwall
[3:22:11.960 --> 3:22:19.960]  the americans millwall is a soccer team or a football team as it's rightly called in east london
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:27.960]  which has a reputation for having fans who let's just say don't back down when it comes to
[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:32.960]  scrapping or fighting so he was caught up in this terror attack
[3:22:32.960 --> 3:22:38.960]  as he defended himself against jihadis who killed eight and injured 38 others during the attack
[3:22:38.960 --> 3:22:46.960]  he ended up with 80 stitches to the head, ear, arms and hands after two of the terrorists slashed at his head and neck
[3:22:46.960 --> 3:22:54.960]  following the attack larner revealed that the terrorists had shouted quote this is for Allah and islam islam islam during the rampage
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:22:57.960]  hashtag nothing to do with islam
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:23:01.960]  now larner himself is being treated as a potential terrorist by the uk government
[3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:06.960]  he was allegedly contacted by far right anti islam activists
[3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:13.960]  and as a result part of the government's prevent terror watch list over fears he might become an extremist
[3:23:13.960 --> 3:23:18.960]  he later said to newspapers they treat me like a terrorist but i'm not political at all
[3:23:18.960 --> 3:23:25.960]  he was then forced to attend deradicalization classes, reeducation and is being monitored by the police
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:34.960]  so i hope the same thing doesn't happen to some of the brave individuals who tackled that terrorist in london today
[3:23:34.960 --> 3:23:40.960]  of course before the break i was mentioning how we're so used to knife crime
[3:23:40.960 --> 3:23:47.960]  that if only two people die as a result of this knife attack horrific though that is in london over this weekend
[3:23:47.960 --> 3:23:52.960]  that will probably be in comparison a low total
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:55.960]  we had this article from back in may
[3:23:55.960 --> 3:24:01.960]  somali parents sending their kids back to africa to escape london knife crime epidemic
[3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:09.960]  hundreds of somali teenagers are being sent back to east africa by their parents in order to avoid becoming victims of london's spiraling knife crime epidemic
[3:24:09.960 --> 3:24:17.960]  one mother told the bbc how her son was stabbed four times in just 17 days in london
[3:24:17.960 --> 3:24:24.960]  she said they damaged his bladder his kidneys his liver he's got permanent damage he was safer in somali land than he was here
[3:24:24.960 --> 3:24:28.960]  100% more safe than in london
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:37.960]  another 21-year-old man called usuf told his mentor jamal hasan he moved to Nairobi because he was seeing people get stabbed in london quote every other day
[3:24:37.960 --> 3:24:46.960]  is linked to mayor rakia ishmael a somali immigrant says that around 40% of somali families are sending their children back home
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:53.960]  even though somalia is listed as the 13th most dangerous country in the world and has big problems with violent crime and terrorism
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:25:04.960]  apparently though for many it's not nearly as terrifying as london figures show there are two killings every day on the streets of britain the highest level in a decade
[3:25:04.960 --> 3:25:12.960]  and while it's true that most of the stabbings most of the knife attacks are gang on gang
[3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:20.960]  it's not uncommon for ordinary members of the public to get caught up in this to get caught up in confrontations between drug dealers for example
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:25.960]  and get knifed or beaten to death it happens on a routine basis
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:31.960]  figures show three-quarters of knife crime offenders are from minority ethnic groups
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:38.960]  53% of victims are from a black or ethnic minority background as I mentioned before the break
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:47.960]  amazing that Warsaw Poland and Budapest hungry don't seem to be suffering the same epidemic interesting that isn't it
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:56.960]  meanwhile this article went up on summit news just about an hour ago and it concerns Desmond is amazing
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:26:05.960]  I know you really want to see more information about Desmond amazing Desmond is amazing the 12 year old drag queen kid don't you you've been eagerly anticipating that
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:11.960]  well now Desmond is amazing appears in front of painting with Ro Hipnol written on it
[3:26:11.960 --> 3:26:20.960]  this is a video that was posted to Twitter in which Desmond who again is 12 years old appears alongside Michael Alec
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:30.960]  the 53 year old former club promoter who served 17 years in prison for manslaughter but killing his drug dealer and then chopping up his dead body
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:35.960]  that's the kind of person you really want your child to be hanging around with isn't it
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:46.960]  Alec's website features numerous other paintings including one of a glowing demon baby that's how he describes it several that feature
[3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:55.960]  pills or packets of Ro Hipnol and another entitled and I can't even say that on the radio you'll have to read it in the article
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:03.960]  earlier this year we highlighted how a convicted child porn peddler wrote an article in which he described Desmond is amazing as quote hot
[3:27:03.960 --> 3:27:16.960]  and that was posted on believe it was Tumblr or similar website was not removed literally it was convicted child porn peddler calling a child hot
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:23.960]  as we reported back in June and you've probably seen the video reacting to concerns of Desmond's performance at a gay nightclub in New York
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:30.960]  where attendees threw money at the child his mother defended the decision telling an Australian TV show
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:42.960]  I don't understand what the controversy is it's not controversial at all is it to have a 12 year old dressed in drag dancing around at a gay nightclub
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:50.960]  and having money thrown at him that's not controversial Desmond was previously involved in drag queen story time in which drag queens visit schools
[3:27:50.960 --> 3:27:56.960]  and libraries across America to read to children which again is completely normal
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:28:05.960]  he also appeared on camera with a drag queen and mimicked snorting ketamine the horse tranquilizer that has become popular as a psychedelic drug
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:15.960]  he literally went like that on camera to simulate taking ketamine while sat in front of a middle aged drag queen again completely normal
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:28.960]  one of the participants at drag queen story time in Houston was 32 year old Albert Garza who later turned out to be a registered sex offender who was convicted of assaulting an 8 year old boy in 2008
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:41.960]  and now Desmond is amazing is palling around with 53 year old men who killed their drug dealer and chopped up his dead body in front of a painting with the word row hipnol
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:48.960]  written on the front of it which again is completely normal don't go away summit dot news will be back

[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:23.960]  think about that now those democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime they know what they're doing
[3:32:23.960 --> 3:32:41.960]  and now the supreme courts come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms my goodness ladies and gentlemen this country is under such incredible attack but more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the second amendment
[3:32:41.960 --> 3:32:55.960]  and they're going to follow the original bill of rights and constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns so you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens well we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws
[3:32:55.960 --> 3:33:11.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show you're listening to summit dot news with paul joseph watson
[3:33:11.960 --> 3:33:31.960]  we're back and we're going to shift to talking about our lord and savior greta sunberg because there's a new article up on summit dot news called swedish school kids tasked with defending greta from critics the eco activists becomes part of religious curriculum yes
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:45.960]  part of the religious course being introduced in schools across sweden where kids are being taught as part of the course about quote religious knowledge they're being tasked with mocking her opponents
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:34:03.960]  the 16 year old climate activist is now included in the school curriculum and is being portrayed in an overtly sympathetic light well of course she is because that's how you kind of have to do it or you'll get banned on youtube
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:17.960]  with the course describing her as an a quote alarm clock that quote allows us to discuss talk and reflect on what is happening to our world according to one student greta is practically painted as a saint
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:37.960]  again students are tasked with making memes about greta that mock her opponents and disprove criticism that has been leveled at her for example criticism like why are you hanging out with Arnold Schwarzenegger if you care about climate change when he literally has a garage full of muscle cars and tanks
[3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:53.960]  hanging out with Leonardo DiCaprio the guy who lectures everyone else about their lifestyle but literally goes on holidays on 40 foot yachts owned by oil billionaire shakes from the Middle East
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:35:09.960]  the guy who literally goes on private jet trips to collect environmental awards that kind of criticism in one task the students are asked to find a picture to illustrate the sentence one simply doesn't mess with Greta and not to an outdated
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:25.960]  orimia meme from Lord of the Rings according to education publisher Liber including Greta in lessons is quote important to constantly offer materials and teaching materials that reflect the contemporary so it's not enough that Greta is basically immune from criticism because
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:41.960]  she's a child and presumably will forever be a child no matter how old she is they're putting up murals of her in San Francisco like a cult leader it's not enough to just shield her from criticism now the kids literally have to take reeducation courses
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:57.960]  to learn how to make propaganda in her favor of course churches in Sweden as we previously reported and now literally ringing bells in her honor while last year the church of Sweden proclaimed Greta to be quote Jesus a successor
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  but it's not a religion at all seriously last month another mural of Thunberg was defaced in Edmonton Alberta with the bundle telling Greta to stop lecturing him on how to live his life and in this article you can watch the video about Greta which was banned by
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:31.960]  YouTube because she's now immune from criticism it's embedded from bit shoe meanwhile Breitbart reports alarmist proposed rebranding climate change for greater shock value because it's not enough apparently to say that the earth is literally going to end in 12 years
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:49.960]  we need more alarmism climate change alarmists are pushing for a change in vocabulary control vocabulary control reality to scare people into taking global warming more seriously starting with terms like global meltdown and climate collapse
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:37:05.960]  which goes to the point that nobody is taking it seriously because they recognize that it's hysterical alarmist BS but virtually every poll that you'd look at shows it's at the bottom of the list when it comes to people's concerns about their lives
[3:37:05.960 --> 3:37:19.960]  writing for adage this week Aaron Hall argues that in order to get people to take action against climate change rebranding is crucial since people have gotten too used to the idea that climate is changing and need to be shocked into the notion that the world as we know it is
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:37.960]  ending just as we saw back in the 1960s with Paul Erlich's population bomb which was the foundation for much of this alarmism in the first place where he literally said that millions and millions of people would starve to death because of climate change
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  of course never happened just like any of these alarmist predictions and proclamations never happened but they think as long as they pronounce them vehemently enough with enough panic in their voices and enough condemnation of anyone who doesn't go along with it
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:38:13.960]  then it's finally going to get through to people good luck with that. Sticking in Sweden stock home 51% of women feel unsafe going out at night that's according to the county's administrative board and new citizen survey more than half of women feel insecure in the evenings
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:28.960]  while the overall figure who feel unsafe rose from 33% to 44% since 2011 the proportion of citizens who feel unsafe in their own residential area during the daytime almost doubled from 11% to 20%
[3:38:28.960 --> 3:38:46.960]  now what possibly could have changed between 2011 and 2019 in Sweden, gee I wonder, the growing insecurity in stock home is also underscored by the fact that more and more county residents are refraining from activities due to concern about being exposed to crime such as walking,
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:39:04.960]  shooting, cinema or visiting acquaintances the report stated and as we previously covered Sweden continues to experience huge problems with violent crime shootings, explosions and grenade attacks. The Prime Minister came out recently and said that it was nothing to do with migrants.
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:20.960]  Swedes don't tend to believe that given a recent opinion poll which found that the anti mass migration Sweden Democrats are now the most popular party in Sweden with the Sweden Democrats getting 24% of the vote if an election was held today beating the ruling social Democrats
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:34.960]  the former CEO of trucking company Scania came out back in October and warned that Sweden is heading towards civil war due to uncontrolled mass immigration. He'll probably be brought upon hate crimes charges.
[3:39:34.960 --> 3:39:47.960]  He said we've taken in far too many people from outside and we have those who came from the Middle East and Africa Live in a society that we left almost 100 years ago. Meanwhile I found this interesting came out a couple of days ago.
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:40:01.960]  More Swedes than ever are on antidepressant drugs with a million of them taking SSRIs that's one tenth of the population, double the amount who took antidepressant in the early 2000s.
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:13.960]  So people in Sweden feel unsafe and unhappy that progressive utopia doesn't seem to be very effective does it. I wonder why.
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:19.960]  Meanwhile RT reports almost 50% of Sweden's homeless population is foreign born.
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:33.960]  I think it's time to do another video on Sweden there's so much information about how great is progressive utopia really is a damning new report suggests Sweden's integration policies are failing migrants who now account for almost 50% of the country's rising
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  homeless population. And of course that is at great cost to the economy. We were sold this idea by Merkel and others that it was not only necessary but absolutely imperative to bring in huge numbers of migrants to fund social liabilities
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:41:06.960]  to become manual labor. Of course I think the stat that I saw last time I checked was about 63% of welfare payments in Sweden went to migrants so that's not really being born out is it.
[3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:17.960]  Meanwhile Alex covered this during the show so I'll just go over it briefly but of course Angela Merkel came out and said freedom of speech must be curtailed to keep society free.
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  And of course as I made the point, Merkel herself, given that Germans are being arrested for hate speech for raising issues shall we say with events such as the mass molestation of women in Cologne Germany on New Year's
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:48.960]  they're being interrogated as potential hate criminals but we have to remember that Angela Merkel herself back in 2010 said that quote multiculturalism has failed.
[3:41:48.960 --> 3:42:03.960]  She then proceeded to import over a million migrants to make Germany more multicultural. And in fact there's a video at the bottom of this article which is banned in Germany even though Germany has a constitution which
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:20.960]  clearly says words to the effect of there should be no censorship whatsoever in which a member of parliament on the Green Party gets up in front of parliament in Germany and says that Germans in major cities will be a minority in their
[3:42:20.960 --> 3:42:39.960]  communities within 20 years and that's a good thing. Now to me celebrating the demographic decline of any particular race, race is bigoted, hateful and racist and maybe the member of the Green Party who said that should be subjected to these
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  new hate speech laws that apparently Angela Merkel is very keen to see passed. We'll be back breaking news at summit.news.inforwards.com and I'll go away.
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:26.960]  Women and women will submit. The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit. We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will.
[3:43:26.960 --> 3:43:42.960]  There's no devil or the God. But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like. They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:51.960]  Oxford's banned clapping. Universities in the US have banned 21 gun salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:44:10.960]  Info Wars Black Friday is here with the biggest sales of the year. 50% off on DNA Force Plus. Triple Patriot Points, free shipping and a free bottle of our best selling Neutropic Brain Boost Brain Force Plus.

[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:13.960]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free, the adult or the children's.
[3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:26.960]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it. This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:42.960]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this, but I had to tell you no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way.
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:52.960]  It doesn't strip away the enamel. So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation. Infowarstore.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[3:45:52.960 --> 3:46:03.960]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when three million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:16.960]  More than 50 to one, some estimates have it. But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, General, we're completely surrounded. He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[3:46:16.960 --> 3:46:26.960]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached. And it really is epic. It really is biblical. And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[3:46:26.960 --> 3:46:37.960]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete. And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced.
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:54.960]  When it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines, because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalist.
[3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:59.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:18.960]  Well, we've had a large dose of cultural enrichment. It appears today in Europe because now reports are emerging that the Gerdue Nord train station in Paris, France has been evacuated due to a suspected explosive device that just came out in the last few minutes.
[3:49:18.960 --> 3:49:32.960]  Meanwhile, 300 in stabbing attack on shopping street in the Hague. That's in the Netherlands. RT reports police are still on the lookout for the attacker who struck at the heart of the city shopping district during the Black Friday rush.
[3:49:32.960 --> 3:49:46.960]  The suspect is described as a lightly colored man to in 45 and 50 years old dressed in a gray tracksuit. In the Netherlands, lightly colored usually refers to a person of North African or Middle Eastern descent.
[3:49:46.960 --> 3:49:59.960]  That sounds pretty racist to me. Of course, in Germany, they describe them as Southern looking. So it remains to be seen what comes out of that and what the motive is.
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:06.960]  Switching now back to America. We had this article up on summit.news a couple of days ago.
[3:50:06.960 --> 3:50:17.960]  American life expectancy dropping dramatically thanks to white working class male suicides. The one demographic that they refuse to talk about.
[3:50:17.960 --> 3:50:35.960]  In fact, according to Lisa Britton who tweeted about this, when they study this, these new numbers came out about male suicides in America, CNN's coverage of the entire story omitted the crucial point that the numbers were being driven by male suicides.
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:50.960]  They deliberately sought to withhold the key crucial aspect of the story, which is that after increasing for decades, American life expectancy is now facing an alarming decline, thanks mainly to suicides of white working age men.
[3:50:50.960 --> 3:51:06.960]  This was published in the journal JMA, which found that life expectancy in America increased from 1959 to 2014, but the number plateaued in 2011 and then began decreasing in 2014.
[3:51:06.960 --> 3:51:21.960]  According to live science, the study found that the decline is mostly among working age Americans or those aged 25 to 64. In this group, the risk of dying from drug abuse, suicide, hypertension and more than 30 other courses is increasing.
[3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:28.960]  And again, that's the suicide driven by the depression driven by the opioid use.
[3:51:28.960 --> 3:51:36.960]  The decline in life expectancy for working age males has not been recorded in other developed countries and is a distinctly American phenomenon.
[3:51:36.960 --> 3:51:49.960]  That's according to study co-author Steven Wolfe, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine. Again, they're not talking about the main demographic that the depression epidemic, the opioid epidemic, the suicide epidemic is impacting.
[3:51:49.960 --> 3:52:01.960]  And it's mainly white working class middle aged Americans. I did an entire video about this, which is in this article called the truth about suicide, which really needs to get out there.
[3:52:01.960 --> 3:52:11.960]  Somebody else tweeted about this. They said CNN just did a piece on the declining life expectancy rate in the US and failed to mention it's the men's rate that is declining.
[3:52:11.960 --> 3:52:22.960]  Women have maintained a steady rate, although there's been an uptick in the women's overdose rate. So again, they're not identifying the main demographic that this is impacting.
[3:52:22.960 --> 3:52:37.960]  While the culture takes a giant dump all over white people at the same time, blames them for every historical and contemporary social ill, delegitimizing their trauma under the rubric of white privilege.
[3:52:37.960 --> 3:52:46.960]  And then when you look at the women, not looking too great for them either. Binge drinking doubles amongst American women without children.
[3:52:46.960 --> 3:52:56.960]  Binge drinking amongst American women without children has doubled in just over a decade, proving that the satirical wine ant meme is actually true.
[3:52:56.960 --> 3:53:13.960]  Now the wine ant meme for those of you who don't know is basically a take off of the Wojak meme, but it's a drunk ant and it's accompanied by a tweet, which really underscores how a lot of millennials have been sold this idea that having no kids,
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:18.960]  no family leads to happiness and freedom tends to lead in the opposite direction.
[3:53:18.960 --> 3:53:29.960]  This tweet says quote, and bearing in mind, it got 213,000 likes on Twitter. It says ladies, imagine this, it's 15 years from now and you have no kids.
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:36.960]  You're the cool wine ant that occasionally comes back to the country for a brief visit before leaving for another long exotic vacation.
[3:53:36.960 --> 3:53:41.960]  You have no commitments and a suspicious amount of money. Yeah.
[3:53:41.960 --> 3:53:51.960]  That's what they bought into the social engineering propaganda that not having children provides them with freedom and happiness when in reality only makes them miserable and lonely.
[3:53:51.960 --> 3:54:03.960]  And as I point out in this article, when those women who don't have any kids and think they're happy and have lives full of freedom reach their later years when they start to get ill and need hospital treatment,
[3:54:03.960 --> 3:54:09.960]  there will be absolutely nobody to take care of them and many of them will likely die alone.
[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:16.960]  Having lived a joyless barren life of meaningless hedonism, so happy you've seen the propaganda.
[3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:21.960]  You've seen the billboards encouraging white people to sterilize themselves.
[3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:32.960]  You've seen the Newsweek front pages, the Time magazine front pages conning women into believing this lifelong barren less existence is going to provide them with endless freedom.
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:39.960]  It doesn't. It does the opposite provides them with endless depression and loneliness.
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:47.960]  Meanwhile, and I did an entire article on this subject, basically the video, sorry, which is going to come out on Sunday.
[3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:53.960]  There's an entire process going on right now in Western culture, which is the infantilization of culture.
[3:54:53.960 --> 3:55:04.960]  And it gets to the question of why comic book superhero movies are so popular, despite the fact that they're blatantly aimed at children.
[3:55:04.960 --> 3:55:11.960]  Why is this parade of comic book superhero movies still resonating amongst millennials in their 30s and 40s?
[3:55:11.960 --> 3:55:17.960]  Well, I get into the reasons for that in that video, but here's an article that ties in.
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:19.960]  It's out of Sputnik.
[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:24.960]  Binge porn kills orgasm insects with real life partner new study finds.
[3:55:24.960 --> 3:55:30.960]  Now, we already know that habitual porn watching literally shrinks people's brains.
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:37.960]  Well, now in a report published in The Conversation, a researcher at Canada's University Laval, Rachel and Barr,
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:43.960]  ones that people who regularly watch adult movies often fall victim to brain damage.
[3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:51.960]  And once again, what does the culture, what does the media support, rampant hedonism, degeneracy and pornography,
[3:55:51.960 --> 3:55:59.960]  even though it's literally giving young people brain damage, more specifically to a region of it known as the prefrontal cortex,
[3:55:59.960 --> 3:56:06.960]  which is not formed until adulthood and is responsible for willpower, morality and impulse.
[3:56:06.960 --> 3:56:18.960]  And in fact, I did a video about this a few weeks ago called No, Not November, the kuma meme, which gets into some of the extremely damaging effects of excessive porn watching.
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:28.960]  And this study ties into it because after years of study, Barr has come to conclude that pornography could cause consumers to struggle with their impulses and emotions,
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:34.960]  possibly leading to compulsive behavior with adults degrading into a childish state.
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:43.960]  So this is one of the examples where they're literally putting out pornography, making people addicted to it, making it acceptable in the culture to be addicted to it.
[3:56:43.960 --> 3:56:53.960]  And again, for this to be one of the great freedoms that we're supposed to embrace, even though it's literally degrading, damaging people's brains,
[3:56:53.960 --> 3:56:58.960]  turning them into kumas and degrading them into a childish state.
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:06.960]  She said it's somewhat paradoxical that adult entertainment may revert our brain wiring to a more juvenile state.
[3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:14.960]  She said the much greater irony is that while porn promises to satisfy and provide sexual gratification, it delivers the opposite,
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:22.960]  which of course is now why we see problems even with young people in their early 20s, problems with erectile dysfunction,
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:29.960]  because it creates pathways in your brain where you can only get aroused by extreme, in many cases, pornography,
[3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:35.960]  and you can no longer get aroused by normal sexual activity with real humans.
[3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:36.960]  That's what they're doing to us.
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:37.960]  That's going to wrap it up.
[3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:53.960]  Coming up, Warren with I'll Enjoy Your Breaking News at Summit.News.
