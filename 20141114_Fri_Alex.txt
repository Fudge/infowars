[01:10.880 --> 01:13.600]  months wanted to get him on to talk about all the different health news
[01:13.600 --> 01:18.560]  GMO news you name it that is taking place so that's in the third hour
[01:18.560 --> 01:27.400]  compounding pharmacist Ben Fuchs where to begin well the whole gruber situation
[01:27.400 --> 01:32.360]  they've now found four clips we only played the first two I thought it was
[01:32.360 --> 01:36.480]  kind of pass a play the third they found yesterday now there's a fourth of him
[01:36.480 --> 01:41.040]  running around calling Americans dumb and teaching college students at MIT in
[01:41.040 --> 01:45.000]  places how to deceive people that's what you learn at college is how to lie and
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.640]  how to bring in a giant frauds that massively raise prices and hide that
[01:49.640 --> 01:54.880]  fact from people so he is certainly hurting Obamacare big time see the
[01:54.880 --> 01:58.200]  Republicans want to pretend like they're fighting it while not repealing it
[01:58.200 --> 02:02.800]  because they're run by the same special interest but something like this the
[02:02.800 --> 02:08.160]  open arrogance of something like this if we exploit it and use it and we were
[02:08.160 --> 02:12.480]  the first to be covering it when it was discovered on Facebook when just someone
[02:12.480 --> 02:16.320]  at the university noticed that it aired on university television and reportedly
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.600]  on some c-span branch and then people started to investigate gruber and they
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.440]  found him just everywhere saying the same thing so later in the broadcast if
[02:26.440 --> 02:29.960]  you can find I think there's maybe five clips now but I know there's four I've
[02:29.960 --> 02:35.400]  seen line all those up maybe we can play him in order I know CJ was saying hey
[02:35.400 --> 02:38.760]  play these clips yesterday I never ever got around to it so maybe we'll play
[02:38.760 --> 02:44.840]  some of the gruber clips groupers goober's Obamacare deception everybody
[02:44.840 --> 02:48.920]  knows Jonathan Gruber now he was a consultant who helped frame the Obamacare
[02:48.920 --> 02:55.080]  law and got paid $400,000 he was in the room with Obama it's now coming out when
[02:55.080 --> 03:00.240]  they came up with all the different deceptions for the American people but
[03:00.240 --> 03:04.720]  it's okay he wears glasses and kind of says it in a squeaky academic voice
[03:04.720 --> 03:09.520]  so it's okay you know if somebody wears a little suit and talks like this and
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.480]  giggles and sticks a knife in your back it's okay as well as long as it's in an
[03:14.480 --> 03:20.960]  NPR voice and it's scary everything's alright okay you know getting your car

[03:36.640 --> 03:41.400]  now we're hoping they can set up a terror attack in America so we can take
[03:41.400 --> 03:46.480]  more liberties and then turn it around on the Tea Party of course they don't
[03:46.480 --> 03:53.640]  really talk in that voice they talk in a high time to go to sleep everyone let's

[08:16.880 --> 08:24.840]  GCN radio network look at this headline ladies and gentlemen from the
[08:24.840 --> 08:29.600]  london guardians special u.n. meeting urges stricter controls over killer
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.640]  robots autonomous killer drone robots killer tanks hunter killer missiles are
[08:36.640 --> 08:44.680]  already in the field on the rocks comet battery could die in hours great
[08:44.680 --> 08:47.840]  victories they were able to land the probe on the comet but they're trying
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.800]  to deploy the drill desperately to get some samples before the battery dies
[08:52.800 --> 09:00.800]  because the lander went in between a crevice area basically a small canyon
[09:00.800 --> 09:07.440]  and sunlight is not getting to its solar panels they're saying that they think is
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.120]  the comet turns more towards the Sun it might get some power as the angle
[09:12.120 --> 09:17.400]  changes but still an incredible feat and first when you don't succeed try try
[09:17.400 --> 09:23.400]  again humans need a organizing motivating factor that comes organically from the
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.040]  people and I believe it should be cherishing our planet taking care of
[09:28.040 --> 09:33.400]  our planet cherishing humanity building up humanity and then our rock stars our
[09:33.400 --> 09:38.880]  hip-hop stars our sports stars should be explorer missions we've got the
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.880]  volunteers we've got the people ready 50 years ago to launch space colonies we've
[09:43.880 --> 09:49.200]  got the technology we've got the people committed ready imagine watching reality
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.360]  TV from a space station that left in 1975 with a couple hundred people on board
[09:54.360 --> 10:00.440]  that's got its own gravity based off a centrifugal force system that they
[10:00.440 --> 10:06.160]  developed under Werner von Braun in the 40s imagine they would already have left
[10:06.160 --> 10:10.760]  the solar system and be on their way to the nearest star systems with those
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.040]  colonies and of course undoubtedly probably will develop technologies so
[10:16.040 --> 10:20.240]  much more advanced that they'll be a tenth of the way to the nearest star
[10:20.240 --> 10:27.000]  system by the time that we get more powerful systems of not just light
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  speed interdimensional jumps you name it that the equations show are there and
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.320]  we'll meet up with those but in case we destroy the planet and kill each other in
[10:35.320 --> 10:40.480]  nuclear war it's good to fire those bases off now people say oh man I want to
[10:40.480 --> 10:45.840]  just go get drunk tonight listen you're meant to be a trailblazer you're meant
[10:45.840 --> 10:51.040]  to want to go on missions you're meant to want to explore and we can do this as
[10:51.040 --> 10:55.840]  a shared community through each other I want to play something that's really
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.200]  heavy on you to use this cheesy 60s term I know everyone knows this
[11:00.200 --> 11:06.840]  intrinsically but I want to just state it again you can be a time traveler in
[11:06.840 --> 11:16.920]  fact you are in the time space continuum a time traveler at the speed of life on
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.920]  this planet whether you live 50 years or 100 years or maybe five years you will
[11:22.920 --> 11:27.160]  travel through time you are traveling through time but not just your physical
[11:27.160 --> 11:33.120]  body they're always in the universe multiple repeats at different levels of
[11:33.120 --> 11:41.800]  the same thing you see this in nature just as you have genetic memories you
[11:41.800 --> 11:47.360]  also have family traits and cultural systems that are passed down person to
[11:47.360 --> 11:53.280]  person there is a physical connection to you going back son daughter to mother
[11:53.280 --> 11:58.840]  father all the way back to our original ancestors a physical bond from your
[11:58.840 --> 12:02.360]  father your mother to their parents to their parents to their great-grand
[12:02.360 --> 12:07.380]  parents it is incredible it is a time space continuum and I never read this
[12:07.380 --> 12:13.720]  in a book I just know this electrical dimensional connection unbroken all the
[12:13.720 --> 12:17.480]  way back to our beginning you can debate that beginning but that's
[12:17.480 --> 12:22.440]  incredible then there's genetic traits and genetic memories that have been
[12:22.440 --> 12:28.320]  proven epigenetics that are in all life forms but that are highly advanced in
[12:28.320 --> 12:35.640]  mammals and the most advanced in Homo sapiens sapiens and the globalist all
[12:35.640 --> 12:40.080]  know this and are programming it artificially with artificial stimuli and
[12:40.080 --> 12:45.880]  things trying to keep you from moving to the next level so when you write a book
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.320]  or when you communicate to someone or when you sit around the campfire and
[12:51.320 --> 12:56.080]  tell archetypal stories to your children they are primed to sit there and
[12:56.080 --> 13:01.720]  listen to fables that are archetypes of little foxes spoiled the grapes the
[13:01.720 --> 13:06.240]  tortoise in the hair all this stuff goes back to the Greeks little foxes
[13:06.240 --> 13:09.080]  spoil the grapes mean it's not the big enemy you see coming down the road
[13:09.080 --> 13:12.240]  that's going to bring you down usually it's the little the little people that
[13:12.240 --> 13:20.360]  you're not watching little foxes spoil the grapes none of these ancient common
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.280]  sense things are being passed on now we're being given false common sense
[13:24.280 --> 13:30.120]  meant to sabotage us but when you begin to communicate archetypal common sense
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.000]  information to people they're primed and ready to receive the truth like a
[13:34.000 --> 13:42.560]  plant is primed and ready to receive water and sunlight and nitrogen so all
[13:42.560 --> 13:47.360]  you've got to do is realize your whole life has been a system trying to keep you
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.880]  from reaching your potential trying to keep you you know first they would call
[13:51.880 --> 13:56.800]  you a young man or young woman when you were 13 then it was 18 then it's 20 now
[13:56.800 --> 14:06.920]  they call college graduates kids now they're calling 30 the new adulthood 30
[14:06.920 --> 14:13.440]  was the lifespan of the average human 50,000 years ago 10,000 years ago now
[14:13.440 --> 14:17.920]  some would be a hundred but on average it was so rough 30 35 most of the graves
[14:17.920 --> 14:26.680]  they dig up of early man they're 25 35 years old I was a man physically and
[14:26.680 --> 14:30.720]  mentally compared to men I see around me today when I was like 14 years old I
[14:30.720 --> 14:37.440]  had the desires of an amateur man I had the political desire to be informed and
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.480]  to be in charge of my life I was into my destiny I was into other people's
[14:41.480 --> 14:49.160]  destiny I was just absolutely into women and dating you know college women when
[14:49.160 --> 14:55.240]  I was 14 that I would have just been normal a hundred years ago ladies and
[14:55.240 --> 15:00.560]  gentlemen but now in the arrested development system I was a complete
[15:00.560 --> 15:08.080]  anomaly everything is geared to keep us not just childlike but in a stupor so
[15:08.080 --> 15:11.440]  you don't grow to the potential because if you grow to the potential you won't
[15:11.440 --> 15:18.160]  care about fads and and in fake status and and garbage and Kim Kardashian you
[15:18.160 --> 15:24.440]  will care about your honor and your genetic legacy of struggle and war and
[15:24.440 --> 15:30.440]  love and passion and art and exploration and trailblazing that is your
[15:30.440 --> 15:35.400]  ancestors gift I don't care where you come from in the world what your
[15:35.400 --> 15:41.600]  background is you are incredible you're not junk you're amazing and you need to
[15:41.600 --> 15:45.200]  realize it and you need to know it and you need to take it in your hands of
[15:45.200 --> 15:49.040]  the challenge the minute you tell your brain and your spirit tells your brain
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.840]  that hey I do have a destiny I'm important God made me in his image this
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.160]  is incredible I'm on a huge space-based platform orbiting a star this is only
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.800]  the beginning then you will feel yourself reaching forward in the time
[16:02.800 --> 16:06.760]  space continuum as all of those people back you all those people that came
[16:06.760 --> 16:12.440]  before us you will realize you are them you will have their memories their
[16:12.440 --> 16:17.360]  instincts everything you'll be a young man you'll be an old man you'll be a
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.560]  soldier you'll be a doctor you'll be a teacher all of that data is already there
[16:23.560 --> 16:28.120]  all of it is already there and the system flicks on like switches and I'm
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.560]  giving you the deep secrets here folks flips on and turns off the switches they
[16:31.560 --> 16:37.840]  want to use us as biological robots well I'm not their slave I was made by the
[16:37.840 --> 16:42.480]  creator of the universe I have a goal I have a mission and I will not be
[16:42.480 --> 16:46.840]  controlled by these people I will step into the destiny I've been given and I
[16:46.840 --> 16:51.120]  will try to build up humanity or I'll die trying and it's in that reaching out
[16:51.120 --> 16:58.920]  that the universe then joins you and providence comes into play but you've
[16:58.920 --> 17:05.040]  got to take that step and commit and it's a spiritual choice and everything the
[17:05.040 --> 17:09.760]  fake churches the media is all about shuddering that potential making you feel
[17:09.760 --> 17:16.800]  guilty and pathetic and then you just sit there and serve the system now the
[17:16.800 --> 17:22.440]  true is there's all these forms of ancestral genetics ancestral memory
[17:22.440 --> 17:30.280]  passing on culture memories person to person fable stories common sense then
[17:30.280 --> 17:34.680]  there's the written word passing on information the digital the spoken and
[17:34.680 --> 17:39.680]  then there's also what they've proven the transmission of the sixth sense the
[17:39.680 --> 17:43.680]  the spiritual energy the connection that we haven't been able to quantify yet but
[17:43.680 --> 17:49.760]  we know is there and as you do those things your spirit your information
[17:49.760 --> 17:54.720]  reaches into the future and I'll be communicating if the species survives a
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.240]  thousand years from now 10,000 years from now in whatever incredible thing we
[18:00.240 --> 18:12.040]  become in God's plan with those humans and that is simply my love it's not for
[18:12.040 --> 18:16.280]  arrogance it's not for ego that I want to be remembered and known I want to know
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.320]  my ancestors and I want our future children to know us I want to commune

[18:28.160 --> 18:32.480]  life after death that's what this is there may have been a French bulldog
[18:32.480 --> 18:36.440]  first developed 200 years ago in England popularized in France when the
[18:36.440 --> 18:40.600]  lace makers came over to England and bred dogs to create the French bulldog
[18:40.600 --> 18:47.560]  but my French bulldog is those French bulldogs of 200 years ago well with
[18:47.560 --> 18:51.440]  humans it's much more advanced ladies and gentlemen and then of course you see
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.800]  the layers then there's the spiritual energy then there is your spirit and it
[18:56.800 --> 19:02.680]  goes on to the next level see see God's plan how massive it is we are living

[19:27.840 --> 19:33.240]  over because your soul knows it's gonna come back on you and why would you want
[19:33.240 --> 19:37.440]  to do that because that person's you as well in that shared experience but you
[19:37.440 --> 19:42.240]  will pay in the next life as well in the spiritual realm because you'll be
[19:42.240 --> 19:45.800]  thrown in with all the bad people and that's hell God doesn't have to do
[19:45.800 --> 19:51.680]  anything God dumps you into what you were what you resonated with what you
[19:51.680 --> 19:56.200]  chose to be when we come back they're talking about impeachment now on the

[23:55.320 --> 24:14.680]  it's time to survive it's time to prepare
[24:14.680 --> 24:20.920]  I had intended to get directly into the impeachment news and then into what
[24:20.920 --> 24:25.080]  could be the collapse of Obamacare and to restart the engine of our economy we
[24:25.080 --> 24:29.040]  can do that it's a desperate situation not just the legislation itself but what
[24:29.040 --> 24:35.240]  it does to the economy that's all coming up we've put together with John Bowne
[24:35.240 --> 24:40.800]  a compilation of groupers four times now in public speaking events bragging
[24:40.800 --> 24:43.920]  about how dumb people are and how they deceive everybody with lack of
[24:43.920 --> 24:49.120]  transparency that's all coming up but think about that what you do now echoes
[24:49.120 --> 24:56.440]  through eternity it is ripples in a pond and the globalists are obsessed with
[24:56.440 --> 25:00.680]  this as well and they want the ultimate exclusivity of the life extension
[25:00.680 --> 25:04.680]  technologies the space travel all of it they've made a decision to let robots
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.400]  take over deal with the mass of humanity decide what humans are going to be like
[25:09.400 --> 25:13.520]  their god get rid of free will this is all public from Google Ray Kurzweil
[25:13.520 --> 25:19.600]  Microsoft I mean this is a cult this is what all the elites say I mean all of
[25:19.600 --> 25:30.120]  them wired magazine just British royalty this is all they talk about how they are
[25:30.120 --> 25:34.120]  going to be gods how they are going to take over the society and so all I'm
[25:34.120 --> 25:37.600]  saying is you need to know this is going on geoengineering of the earth's
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.160]  atmosphere engineering of all the major plant and animal life being
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.800]  manipulated open air release of extremely dangerous stuff that could
[25:45.800 --> 25:50.880]  create atmospheric blights that would kill the planet like the Andromeda strain
[25:50.880 --> 25:55.800]  or something right out of interstellar these people I can analyze what they're
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.720]  doing on every front and it is unspeakably dangerous and unspeakably
[26:00.720 --> 26:07.280]  wild and reckless and clearly demonically directed and even if you
[26:07.280 --> 26:11.440]  don't believe in physical demons it doesn't matter what they're doing is
[26:11.440 --> 26:17.520]  what I would expect a creature to do that wanted to destroy life on the planet
[26:17.520 --> 26:22.360]  dumbing people down poisoning everything while they say they're setting up a
[26:22.360 --> 26:26.800]  police state and setting up a total control grid to save the earth while
[26:26.800 --> 26:33.040]  they destroy it I mean I knew when Obama said I pledge no troops in Iraq that he
[26:33.040 --> 26:38.560]  would send a massive force he sent six thousand like a week later and now the
[26:38.560 --> 26:42.480]  Pentagon's come out and said they're ready to send masses of troops into
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.480]  Iraq to buy to battle ISIS now why would they lie so openly why wouldn't they
[26:48.480 --> 26:52.080]  just say we're sending troops because they want to train you that they lie to
[26:52.080 --> 26:57.040]  you and you just accept it they're basically bum rushing everybody trying
[26:57.040 --> 27:01.960]  to overwhelm us trying to make us break but instead that can boomerang back on
[27:01.960 --> 27:04.680]  them and it is starting to happen
[27:04.680 --> 27:10.280]  Boehner is weighing expanding a lawsuit over Obama executive orders to cover
[27:10.280 --> 27:14.040]  immigration House Speaker Boehner is considering expanding a proposed
[27:14.040 --> 27:17.200]  federal lawsuit over President Obama's executive orders to include action on
[27:17.200 --> 27:23.920]  immigration illegals have been caught on tape Washington examiner is reporting
[27:23.920 --> 27:29.840]  flipping off ice the headline is working for ice as hell right now as
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.400]  Obama plans amnesty for illegals the illegals are getting very arrogant just
[27:34.400 --> 27:39.240]  laughing at ice people that try to do their job meanwhile crowd hammer says
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.120]  it's an impeachable offense and that's more like it we don't need lawsuits we
[27:43.120 --> 27:49.040]  need hearings to start we need Congress to withdraw funding from the executive
[27:49.040 --> 27:54.000]  branch shut down the government and then Congress needs to begin impeachment as
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.920]  an emergency immediately because the president is lowering the borders that's
[27:57.920 --> 28:01.680]  like lowering the drawbridge to the kingdom and giving the people money to
[28:01.680 --> 28:06.200]  incentivize it and violating federal and state law I mean what do you do if the
[28:06.200 --> 28:11.240]  president starts snorting cocaine on the White House lawn you arresting doesn't
[28:11.240 --> 28:15.480]  matter he's the president he is not a dictator though though if we allow him
[28:15.480 --> 28:19.880]  to do this this has never been done even Jonathan Turley a big liberal says
[28:19.880 --> 28:26.920]  Obama has tripled the constitutional violations of George W Bush and believe
[28:26.920 --> 28:31.000]  me if he isn't punished the Republicans when they get in unless it's a Rand
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.960]  Paul or somebody that I trust are going to abuse these unfounded powers and
[28:34.960 --> 28:40.520]  Rand Paul doesn't want these unfounded powers here is crowd hammer talking
[28:40.520 --> 28:48.640]  about how it is a impeachable offense on Fox News look I believe it is an
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.240]  impeachable offense if the circumstances were different if we were at the
[28:53.240 --> 28:58.440]  beginning of a presidency if we hadn't had years when the Congress has been
[28:58.440 --> 29:05.680]  supine and unresponsive at other grabs of their authority by the executive like
[29:05.680 --> 29:12.440]  Obama unilaterally changing Obamacare after it was passed about 30 times with
[29:12.440 --> 29:18.120]  no response from the Congress the same as Obama sensually rewriting some of the
[29:18.120 --> 29:22.680]  drug laws this idea prosecutorial discretion is really a travesty
[29:22.680 --> 29:26.400]  what's up there and it for extreme case yeah that's it they're overthrowing the
[29:26.400 --> 29:29.880]  entire Constitution it's being done on purpose and if Congress doesn't act now
[29:29.880 --> 29:35.200]  they are ceremonial we and we have a Caesar now he'll leave office I believe
[29:35.200 --> 29:39.840]  but a new one will come in and they're making the office dictatorial we don't
[29:39.840 --> 29:43.600]  elect dictators okay we need checks and balances we're gonna come back with more

[34:47.120 --> 34:51.120]  and a lot of people now on talk radio realize
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.120]  that we just can't let Obama legalize
[34:54.120 --> 34:56.120]  tens of millions of illegals with the stroke of a pen
[34:56.120 --> 34:58.120]  who he's already done without the executive order
[34:58.120 --> 35:00.120]  but we can't have him even put it on paper
[35:00.120 --> 35:02.120]  and officially do it
[35:02.120 --> 35:04.120]  we can't have him shut down more power plants
[35:04.120 --> 35:06.120]  when Congress voted it down four years ago
[35:06.120 --> 35:07.120]  or five years ago
[35:07.120 --> 35:11.120]  we can't have him put our military under NATO command
[35:11.120 --> 35:12.120]  outside of law
[35:12.120 --> 35:14.120]  we can't have him set up the carbon taxes
[35:14.120 --> 35:17.120]  as he announced this week in China
[35:17.120 --> 35:19.120]  without congressional approval
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.120]  we can't have him go after the guns
[35:22.120 --> 35:26.120]  next year with the UN treaty that goes into effect December 24th
[35:26.120 --> 35:30.120]  we cannot have him ignore the courts
[35:30.120 --> 35:32.120]  and ignore the Congress
[35:32.120 --> 35:34.120]  not that they're perfect but
[35:34.120 --> 35:37.120]  this is an open flaunting as Krauthammer was saying
[35:37.120 --> 35:42.120]  Obama has changed Obamacare 30 plus times we know of
[35:42.120 --> 35:44.120]  it's a lie with 21 taxes
[35:44.120 --> 35:48.120]  seven of them on people making below the poverty line
[35:48.120 --> 35:50.120]  that should be on welfare
[35:50.120 --> 35:52.120]  there are a lot of folks just so hard working
[35:52.120 --> 35:53.120]  but so poor
[35:53.120 --> 35:55.120]  black folks, Hispanics, white folks
[35:55.120 --> 35:56.120]  I know a lot of them
[35:56.120 --> 35:58.120]  that they're below the poverty line
[35:58.120 --> 35:59.120]  but won't take welfare
[35:59.120 --> 36:01.120]  and they all just live together
[36:01.120 --> 36:03.120]  three or four families in a home
[36:03.120 --> 36:05.120]  and that's just what they do
[36:05.120 --> 36:06.120]  and they go out and they work
[36:06.120 --> 36:08.120]  and see at an emotional level
[36:08.120 --> 36:10.120]  I want to make the minimum wage 20 bucks
[36:10.120 --> 36:13.120]  but I realize that that's a scam
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.120]  that'll just shut down smaller businesses that can't pay it
[36:15.120 --> 36:17.120]  because when you pay somebody 20 bucks
[36:17.120 --> 36:19.120]  you got to pay Social Security, FICA
[36:19.120 --> 36:21.120]  all these matching funds on top
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.120]  so basically you're paying somebody 20 bucks an hour
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.120]  you're paying about $27 an hour
[36:25.120 --> 36:27.120]  you're paying somebody $10 an hour
[36:27.120 --> 36:29.120]  you're paying about 15 bucks an hour
[36:29.120 --> 36:30.120]  do folks know that?
[36:30.120 --> 36:32.120]  oh see most Americans don't run
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.120]  a operation with employees
[36:34.120 --> 36:36.120]  I do
[36:36.120 --> 36:38.120]  you pay somebody $25 an hour
[36:38.120 --> 36:40.120]  you're paying them $35 an hour
[36:40.120 --> 36:44.120]  $35 an hour
[36:44.120 --> 36:46.120]  you understand that?
[36:48.120 --> 36:50.120]  so they've devalued the dollar
[36:50.120 --> 36:52.120]  that Ron Paul kept warning of
[36:52.120 --> 36:54.120]  it's caused inflation
[36:54.120 --> 36:55.120]  look at what hamburger costs
[36:55.120 --> 36:57.120]  three times what it was 10 years ago
[36:57.120 --> 36:59.120]  cars are twice what they were 10 years ago
[36:59.120 --> 37:01.120]  only thing that is what it was a few years ago
[37:01.120 --> 37:02.120]  was oil
[37:02.120 --> 37:04.120]  because they've been artificially manipulating it down
[37:04.120 --> 37:06.120]  because they have a total global oligopoly
[37:06.120 --> 37:08.120]  to bankrupt Russia
[37:08.120 --> 37:10.120]  so that's a nice side effect for us
[37:10.120 --> 37:12.120]  to have lower fuel prices
[37:12.120 --> 37:14.120]  but it's done as a weapon
[37:14.120 --> 37:16.120]  just like they're shutting down the coal
[37:16.120 --> 37:18.120]  in this country because we got more
[37:18.120 --> 37:20.120]  in the whole world combined basically
[37:20.120 --> 37:22.120]  and it's clean and it doesn't put anything
[37:22.120 --> 37:24.120]  out of carbon dioxide that we exhale
[37:24.120 --> 37:26.120]  and water vapor so they're shutting that down
[37:26.120 --> 37:28.120]  do you understand the globalist
[37:28.120 --> 37:30.120]  have a rigged global economy to a great extent
[37:30.120 --> 37:32.120]  they're trying to get a total
[37:32.120 --> 37:34.120]  global rigged economy crony economy
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.120]  and if they get that Katie bar the door
[37:36.120 --> 37:38.120]  because they've told us what their ideology is
[37:38.120 --> 37:40.120]  it's codified
[37:40.120 --> 37:42.120]  in a worldwide treaty in 1992
[37:42.120 --> 37:44.120]  called Agenda 21
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.120]  stuff like Cloward and Piven
[37:48.120 --> 37:50.120]  that we talk about is just one of hundreds of their reports
[37:50.120 --> 37:52.120]  and their plans that got popularized
[37:52.120 --> 37:54.120]  you know a decade ago
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.120]  and then by Glenn Beck a few years ago
[37:56.120 --> 37:58.120]  but it's only one strategy
[37:58.120 --> 38:00.120]  to make you totally poor so they can control you
[38:00.120 --> 38:02.120]  well that's a classic communist strategy
[38:04.120 --> 38:06.120]  do you understand that folks this is
[38:06.120 --> 38:08.120]  weaponized premeditated
[38:08.120 --> 38:10.120]  does the average cop in on it no they're just
[38:10.120 --> 38:12.120]  trying to go out and generate revenue
[38:12.120 --> 38:14.120]  and go to calls
[38:14.120 --> 38:16.120]  does the
[38:16.120 --> 38:18.120]  average school teacher know this no
[38:18.120 --> 38:20.120]  does the average military person know does the average general
[38:20.120 --> 38:22.120]  even know this no
[38:22.120 --> 38:24.120]  they have their areas their responsibilities
[38:24.120 --> 38:26.120]  and they want to go play golf or they want to go see their
[38:26.120 --> 38:28.120]  mistress
[38:28.120 --> 38:30.120]  they want to go see a movie
[38:30.120 --> 38:32.120]  they want to go read a book they want to go to the Caribbean
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.120]  the average CEO does it you know
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.120]  goes to the meetings I mean really high level
[38:38.120 --> 38:40.120]  fortune 100 they're in board meetings the master plan
[38:42.120 --> 38:44.120]  the main shareholders of work
[38:44.120 --> 38:46.120]  I remember
[38:46.120 --> 38:48.120]  Rex Tillerson the head of ExxonMobil
[38:50.120 --> 38:52.120]  wouldn't sign on to carbon taxes about
[38:52.120 --> 38:54.120]  eight years ago seven years ago
[38:54.120 --> 38:56.120]  and David Rockefeller was in the news in the
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.120]  board meeting told him listen
[38:58.120 --> 39:00.120]  this isn't about
[39:00.120 --> 39:02.120]  keeping the economy going I don't
[39:02.120 --> 39:04.120]  care if you're saying this will shut down the US
[39:04.120 --> 39:06.120]  economy and it's meant to
[39:06.120 --> 39:08.120]  make us you know energy totally dependent
[39:08.120 --> 39:10.120]  you're going to do this or I will fire
[39:10.120 --> 39:12.120]  you
[39:12.120 --> 39:14.120]  because you know who the majority shareholder
[39:14.120 --> 39:16.120]  of ExxonMobil is
[39:16.120 --> 39:18.120]  ExxonMobil are standard
[39:18.120 --> 39:20.120]  oil folks when they broke those giants
[39:20.120 --> 39:22.120]  up in 1906
[39:22.120 --> 39:24.120]  all it was
[39:24.120 --> 39:26.120]  was 11 different
[39:26.120 --> 39:28.120]  signs on the gas stations the oil
[39:28.120 --> 39:30.120]  all came out of the same standard
[39:30.120 --> 39:32.120]  oil trucks
[39:32.120 --> 39:34.120]  and the only other oil companies
[39:34.120 --> 39:36.120]  out there
[39:36.120 --> 39:38.120]  there's some South American companies operating in the US
[39:38.120 --> 39:40.120]  but the big ones are Dutch Royal Shell and BP
[39:40.120 --> 39:42.120]  and do you know who
[39:42.120 --> 39:44.120]  co-owns Dutch Royal Shell and BP
[39:44.120 --> 39:46.120]  little hint one of them is called
[39:46.120 --> 39:48.120]  Dutch Royal Shell
[39:48.120 --> 39:50.120]  it's almost completely
[39:50.120 --> 39:52.120]  owned by the Royal Family
[39:52.120 --> 39:54.120]  and their wealth is secret
[39:54.120 --> 39:56.120]  but you know who the other owner
[39:56.120 --> 39:58.120]  of it is
[39:58.120 --> 40:00.120]  the Queen of England
[40:00.120 --> 40:02.120]  and do you know who the only other owners in BP
[40:02.120 --> 40:04.120]  are in the preferred
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.120]  central system in stock
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.120]  privately held system
[40:08.120 --> 40:10.120]  they have some publicly held subsidiaries
[40:10.120 --> 40:12.120]  the Queen of the Netherlands
[40:12.120 --> 40:14.120]  because they're cousins
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.120]  those two women
[40:16.120 --> 40:18.120]  one of them stepped down
[40:18.120 --> 40:20.120]  now they have a king
[40:20.120 --> 40:22.120]  that king and then his cousin Queen Elizabeth
[40:22.120 --> 40:24.120]  the Dutch King and the British Queen
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.120]  own
[40:26.120 --> 40:28.120]  the second and third largest oil companies
[40:28.120 --> 40:30.120]  in the world
[40:30.120 --> 40:32.120]  see that's the type of wealth we're talking about
[40:32.120 --> 40:34.120]  so much wealth
[40:34.120 --> 40:36.120]  they could lower oil prices after gouging us
[40:36.120 --> 40:38.120]  for all these years
[40:38.120 --> 40:40.120]  to now bankrupt Russia
[40:40.120 --> 40:42.120]  so Russia can't sell its oil cheap
[40:42.120 --> 40:44.120]  and undercut them
[40:44.120 --> 40:46.120]  we'll go even lower
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.120]  that's how this stuff
[40:50.120 --> 40:52.120]  operates and
[40:52.120 --> 40:54.120]  Obamacare is meant to blow our engine
[40:56.120 --> 40:58.120]  cutting our power plants off is meant to blow our engine
[40:58.120 --> 41:00.120]  any free sovereign nation
[41:00.120 --> 41:02.120]  while being exploited and funding the new world order
[41:02.120 --> 41:04.120]  at one level
[41:04.120 --> 41:06.120]  is also under attack by the globalist
[41:06.120 --> 41:08.120]  Russia is under attack
[41:08.120 --> 41:10.120]  the United States is under attack
[41:10.120 --> 41:12.120]  we are being deindustrialized just like the globalists
[41:12.120 --> 41:14.120]  have tried to block industrialization
[41:14.120 --> 41:16.120]  in Latin America
[41:16.120 --> 41:18.120]  in Asia in many areas
[41:18.120 --> 41:20.120]  and in Africa especially
[41:20.120 --> 41:22.120]  that's why there's a war on small business
[41:22.120 --> 41:24.120]  that's why there's a war on lemonade stands
[41:24.120 --> 41:26.120]  in farmers markets
[41:26.120 --> 41:28.120]  that's why there's a war on truck farms
[41:28.120 --> 41:30.120]  that's why there's all this bureaucracy
[41:30.120 --> 41:32.120]  and the bureaucrats
[41:32.120 --> 41:34.120]  are taught they're saving the world
[41:34.120 --> 41:36.120]  they're good people and why they're compartmentalized
[41:36.120 --> 41:38.120]  I'm here to decompartmentalize you
[41:38.120 --> 41:40.120]  and I challenge you
[41:40.120 --> 41:42.120]  to write notes on what I say
[41:42.120 --> 41:44.120]  and to go check it out
[41:44.120 --> 41:46.120]  because if you rationalize this
[41:46.120 --> 41:48.120]  and just say I'm a cook
[41:48.120 --> 41:50.120]  God's looking at you the universe is looking at you
[41:50.120 --> 41:52.120]  fate's looking at you your kids are looking at you
[41:52.120 --> 41:54.120]  and that's the same as joining it
[41:54.120 --> 41:56.120]  you can't cop out in this
[41:56.120 --> 41:58.120]  go look it up prove me wrong
[41:58.120 --> 42:00.120]  or join us
[42:00.120 --> 42:02.120]  and by joining us that just means admitting
[42:02.120 --> 42:04.120]  there's a scientific world government being established
[42:04.120 --> 42:06.120]  that if it gets into place
[42:06.120 --> 42:08.120]  Katie bar the door
[42:08.120 --> 42:10.120]  it's not even fully in place yet
[42:10.120 --> 42:12.120]  and I'm watching this
[42:12.120 --> 42:14.120]  singularity
[42:14.120 --> 42:16.120]  system being set up
[42:16.120 --> 42:18.120]  this weaponized electronic
[42:18.120 --> 42:20.120]  automated
[42:20.120 --> 42:22.120]  autonomous globalist kill grid
[42:22.120 --> 42:24.120]  and I read all their publications admitting
[42:24.120 --> 42:26.120]  that they're building the grid and it's almost in place
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.120]  and I'm sitting here
[42:28.120 --> 42:30.120]  giving you the sources
[42:32.120 --> 42:34.120]  we're under attack
[42:34.120 --> 42:36.120]  and we're not being conquered
[42:36.120 --> 42:38.120]  like the Normans conquered England
[42:38.120 --> 42:40.120]  and brought a lot of science
[42:40.120 --> 42:42.120]  and stuff in and we're oppressors at one level
[42:42.120 --> 42:44.120]  but also in powers at another
[42:44.120 --> 42:46.120]  it's not like they just want to run things
[42:48.120 --> 42:50.120]  and then you know marry our daughters
[42:50.120 --> 42:52.120]  and then we're not in charge anymore
[42:52.120 --> 42:54.120]  because it doesn't matter our kids are
[42:54.120 --> 42:56.120]  it's not a merger
[42:56.120 --> 42:58.120]  it's not a corporate takeover
[42:58.120 --> 43:00.120]  it's a corporate takeover
[43:00.120 --> 43:02.120]  to kill you
[43:02.120 --> 43:04.120]  do you understand that
[43:04.120 --> 43:06.120]  I think you're smart enough to face
[43:06.120 --> 43:08.120]  a scientific attack of this nature
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.120]  even though it's sophisticated once you're aware of it
[43:10.120 --> 43:12.120]  and admit it
[43:12.120 --> 43:14.120]  that's half the battle
[43:14.120 --> 43:16.120]  you've heard that saying that's not just a G.I. Joe saying in the cartoon
[43:16.120 --> 43:18.120]  that's an intelligence saying
[43:18.120 --> 43:20.120]  knowing is half the battle
[43:20.120 --> 43:22.120]  and then taking action
[43:22.120 --> 43:24.120]  is the other half
[43:24.120 --> 43:26.120]  so
[43:26.120 --> 43:28.120]  that's what's going on and
[43:28.120 --> 43:30.120]  it doesn't matter if it's Ezekiel a manual
[43:30.120 --> 43:32.120]  it doesn't matter if it's Gruber
[43:32.120 --> 43:34.120]  it doesn't matter who it is
[43:34.120 --> 43:36.120]  they get up there in the academics
[43:36.120 --> 43:38.120]  and this is what they teach in colleges
[43:38.120 --> 43:40.120]  they teach in corporate board rooms
[43:40.120 --> 43:42.120]  yes it's a fraud, yes it's a monopoly
[43:42.120 --> 43:44.120]  yes we scam people
[43:44.120 --> 43:46.120]  and what you really learn at MIT
[43:46.120 --> 43:48.120]  and what you really learn at the UT Business School
[43:48.120 --> 43:50.120]  and what you're really going to learn
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.120]  when you are
[43:52.120 --> 43:54.120]  you know at the Harvard Business School
[43:54.120 --> 43:56.120]  or what you're really going to learn at
[43:56.120 --> 43:58.120]  Chicago Business School or what you're really going to learn
[43:58.120 --> 44:00.120]  at the Ph.D. level
[44:00.120 --> 44:02.120]  what you're really going to learn
[44:02.120 --> 44:04.120]  is hey
[44:04.120 --> 44:06.120]  we're part of a secret crew of social engineers
[44:06.120 --> 44:08.120]  we're taken over
[44:08.120 --> 44:10.120]  so we can run your life in social engineer
[44:10.120 --> 44:12.120]  government's got to run healthcare
[44:12.120 --> 44:14.120]  that's going to take a lot of money
[44:14.120 --> 44:16.120]  we want to get rid of the old system to build a new
[44:16.120 --> 44:18.120]  command destruction, creative destruction
[44:18.120 --> 44:20.120]  and so we need you to get behind this
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.120]  of course you're only
[44:22.120 --> 44:24.120]  going to be given one compartmentalization
[44:24.120 --> 44:26.120]  just like the MIT engineers
[44:26.120 --> 44:28.120]  I knew 15 years ago
[44:28.120 --> 44:30.120]  really nice guys
[44:30.120 --> 44:32.120]  and then I moved to another neighborhood
[44:32.120 --> 44:34.120]  and another IBM engineer
[44:34.120 --> 44:36.120]  when IBM was still in Austin
[44:36.120 --> 44:38.120]  and they said yeah no I'm here to train
[44:38.120 --> 44:40.120]  all the Indian workers to replace the US workers
[44:40.120 --> 44:42.120]  but they tell us we'll still be in management
[44:42.120 --> 44:44.120]  over the Indians and I said no you won't
[44:44.120 --> 44:46.120]  and they said oh I think you're wrong Alex
[44:46.120 --> 44:48.120]  you know they want some Americans there running things
[44:48.120 --> 44:50.120]  and I said okay
[44:50.120 --> 44:52.120]  years later they apologized to me and said no you were right
[44:52.120 --> 44:54.120]  then I ran into another engineer
[44:54.120 --> 44:56.120]  who was one of the last ones
[44:56.120 --> 44:58.120]  and he said no I'm being trained now for the next year
[44:58.120 --> 45:00.120]  I'm training my final
[45:00.120 --> 45:02.120]  replacements and
[45:02.120 --> 45:04.120]  and I knew years ago this is what was happening but
[45:06.120 --> 45:08.120]  you know it's just sad because Henry Ford
[45:08.120 --> 45:10.120]  would pay people enough so they could buy the product
[45:10.120 --> 45:12.120]  we're going to talk about that when Jesse Ventura next time
[45:12.120 --> 45:14.120]  wants to get into it but
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.120]  now they don't want there to be an economy
[45:20.120 --> 45:22.120]  so this is designed
[45:22.120 --> 45:24.120]  to make you powerless
[45:24.120 --> 45:26.120]  so you accept the virtual reality
[45:26.120 --> 45:28.120]  so you accept the free drugs the government's going to give out
[45:28.120 --> 45:30.120]  so you just accept the whole drug culture
[45:30.120 --> 45:32.120]  the whole collapse culture
[45:32.120 --> 45:34.120]  the whole humans are ugly culture
[45:34.120 --> 45:36.120]  humans are junk
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.120]  humans are over humans are
[45:38.120 --> 45:40.120]  our yesterday's dish
[45:40.120 --> 45:42.120]  the new super trendy will merge with the computers
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.120]  well Gruber
[45:44.120 --> 45:46.120]  now admits Obama was in room
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.120]  when Cadillac tax lie was created
[45:48.120 --> 45:50.120]  but Jonathan Gruber is taking heat for now
[45:50.120 --> 45:52.120]  was planned out specifically
[45:52.120 --> 45:54.120]  with Barack Obama
[45:54.120 --> 45:56.120]  do you understand he was one of the main architects
[45:56.120 --> 45:58.120]  of 14 people
[45:58.120 --> 46:00.120]  in these boardrooms
[46:00.120 --> 46:02.120]  and he has such disdain for you
[46:02.120 --> 46:04.120]  he thinks you're so pathetic
[46:04.120 --> 46:06.120]  that even when he brags on TV
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.120]  that you will accept him
[46:08.120 --> 46:10.120]  rubbing it in
[46:10.120 --> 46:12.120]  let's play a compilation from the first video
[46:12.120 --> 46:14.120]  to the second video the third video
[46:14.120 --> 46:16.120]  to the newest fourth video
[46:16.120 --> 46:18.120]  that Gruber was in the room
[46:18.120 --> 46:20.120]  with our Democrats are saying
[46:20.120 --> 46:22.120]  do you want to cheat us
[46:22.120 --> 46:24.120]  to the Wall Street Journal
[46:24.120 --> 46:26.120]  this Democrats giving up on Obamacare
[46:26.120 --> 46:28.120]  giving up on it
[46:28.120 --> 46:30.120]  you mean you're a rat leaving the sinking ship
[46:30.120 --> 46:32.120]  most of you high level Democrats knew what this was
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.120]  you kind of like social engineering
[46:34.120 --> 46:36.120]  you kind of like I mean we're screwing people over
[46:36.120 --> 46:38.120]  that's kind of sexy
[46:38.120 --> 46:40.120]  let's go ahead and go to the tape
[46:40.120 --> 46:42.120]  lack of transparency is a huge political advantage
[46:42.120 --> 46:44.120]  how in the world
[46:44.120 --> 46:46.120]  can this be HIPAA compliant
[46:46.120 --> 46:48.120]  which HIPAA is designed to
[46:48.120 --> 46:50.120]  protect the patient's privacy
[46:50.120 --> 46:52.120]  and this explicitly says
[46:52.120 --> 46:54.120]  in order to continue you have to
[46:54.120 --> 46:56.120]  accept this condition
[46:56.120 --> 46:58.120]  that you have no privacy
[46:58.120 --> 47:00.120]  or no reasonable expectations of privacy
[47:00.120 --> 47:02.120]  three different people were given access to her account
[47:02.120 --> 47:04.120]  her address
[47:04.120 --> 47:06.120]  and her social security number
[47:06.120 --> 47:08.120]  and John Kerry said no no no we're going to tax your health insurance
[47:08.120 --> 47:10.120]  we're going to tax those evil insurance companies
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.120]  we're going to impose a tax this
[47:12.120 --> 47:14.120]  they say health insurance is too expensive
[47:14.120 --> 47:16.120]  we're going to tax them and conveniently the tax rate
[47:16.120 --> 47:18.120]  is a marginal tax rate under the income tax code
[47:18.120 --> 47:20.120]  so basically it's the same thing
[47:20.120 --> 47:22.120]  we just tax the insurance companies
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.120]  they pass it on higher prices
[47:24.120 --> 47:26.120]  that offsets the tax rate we get
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.120]  it ends up being the same thing
[47:28.120 --> 47:30.120]  so a very clever you know basic exploitation
[47:30.120 --> 47:32.120]  of the lack of economic understanding
[47:32.120 --> 47:34.120]  the American voter
[47:34.120 --> 47:36.120]  well first off the bill has 10 years
[47:36.120 --> 47:38.120]  of tax increases about half a trillion dollars
[47:38.120 --> 47:40.120]  with 10 years of Medicare cuts
[47:40.120 --> 47:42.120]  about half a trillion dollars
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.120]  to pay for six years of spending
[47:44.120 --> 47:46.120]  we will keep this promise
[47:46.120 --> 47:48.120]  to the American people
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.120]  if you like your doctor
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.120]  you will be able to keep your doctor
[47:52.120 --> 47:54.120]  period
[47:54.120 --> 47:56.120]  but for the average person many of folks
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.120]  who don't have health insurance initially
[47:58.120 --> 48:00.120]  um
[48:00.120 --> 48:02.120]  they're going to have to make some choices
[48:02.120 --> 48:04.120]  and they might end up having to switch doctors
[48:04.120 --> 48:06.120]  in part because they're saving money
[48:06.120 --> 48:08.120]  Supreme Court is going to take that case
[48:08.120 --> 48:10.120]  and the question is are they going to speak to the way it was written
[48:10.120 --> 48:12.120]  or are they going to rewrite
[48:12.120 --> 48:14.120]  the interesting thing about the bill
[48:14.120 --> 48:16.120]  all 2,000 pages
[48:16.120 --> 48:18.120]  it's a gigantic blank check
[48:18.120 --> 48:20.120]  their insurance is stronger, better
[48:20.120 --> 48:22.120]  or more secure than it was before
[48:22.120 --> 48:24.120]  premiums go up
[48:24.120 --> 48:26.120]  employers not going to want to pay those premiums
[48:26.120 --> 48:28.120]  they're going to pass on as much
[48:28.120 --> 48:30.120]  as possible to the employee
[48:30.120 --> 48:32.120]  we said well that's pretty much the same thing
[48:32.120 --> 48:34.120]  but why the matter is that you'll see
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.120]  and they're both going to back pass
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.120]  the American voter is too stupid to understand the difference
[48:38.120 --> 48:40.120]  the American voter is too stupid to understand the difference
[48:40.120 --> 48:42.120]  although we know it'll work
[48:42.120 --> 48:44.120]  go after this
[48:44.120 --> 48:46.120]  now the problem is it's a political nightmare
[48:46.120 --> 48:48.120]  and people say no you can't tax my benefits
[48:48.120 --> 48:50.120]  it feels like
[48:50.120 --> 48:52.120]  so what we did in that room was think about
[48:52.120 --> 48:54.120]  well how could we make this work
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.120]  and Obama's like well
[48:56.120 --> 48:58.120]  I mean he's really a realistic guy
[48:58.120 --> 49:00.120]  he's like look I can't just do this
[49:00.120 --> 49:02.120]  he said it's just not going to happen politically
[49:02.120 --> 49:04.120]  the bill will not pass
[49:04.120 --> 49:06.120]  how do we manage to get there through phasins
[49:06.120 --> 49:08.120]  and other things and we talked about it
[49:08.120 --> 49:10.120]  that ultimately became the genesis of what's called
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.120]  the Cadillac tax in the health care bill
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.120]  which I think is one of the most important
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.120]  and bravest parts of the health care law
[49:16.120 --> 49:18.120]  and doesn't get nearly enough credit
[49:18.120 --> 49:20.120]  lack of transparency
[49:20.120 --> 49:22.120]  is a huge political advantage
[49:22.120 --> 49:24.120]  and basically you know call it the stupidity
[49:24.120 --> 49:26.120]  of the American voter or whatever
[49:26.120 --> 49:28.120]  but basically that was really really critical
[49:28.120 --> 49:30.120]  to getting the thing to pass
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.120]  now
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.120]  now you notice that he's bragging
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.120]  that he helped with Obama come up with a plan
[49:40.120 --> 49:42.120]  to put it in phases so it's after the election
[49:42.120 --> 49:44.120]  just keep saying your premiums aren't going up
[49:44.120 --> 49:46.120]  and just keep saying that
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.120]  they love you and your races if you don't agree with them
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  and to deceive people
[49:50.120 --> 49:52.120]  Obama said I can't do this politically
[49:52.120 --> 49:54.120]  double and triple people's prices
[49:54.120 --> 49:56.120]  how do we lie
[49:56.120 --> 49:58.120]  and so Gruber's bragging he helped come up with
[49:58.120 --> 50:00.120]  the horse crap
[50:00.120 --> 50:02.120]  to shovel at everyone
[50:04.120 --> 50:06.120]  but we don't need Gruber to tell us
[50:06.120 --> 50:08.120]  we know there are death panels
[50:08.120 --> 50:10.120]  the prices are going up
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.120]  they're bringing in tens of millions of illegals
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.120]  to give them free health care while denying it
[50:14.120 --> 50:16.120]  to veterans because it's meant to
[50:16.120 --> 50:18.120]  bankrupt the country
[50:18.120 --> 50:20.120]  and I think Gruber probably knows
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.120]  the whole game plan he's only telling you
[50:22.120 --> 50:24.120]  to his students
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.120]  why we lie why we deceive
[50:26.120 --> 50:28.120]  because it's for a greater good
[50:28.120 --> 50:30.120]  no Gruber it's foreign
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.120]  insurance companies that wrote it
[50:32.120 --> 50:34.120]  they get half the money basically
[50:34.120 --> 50:36.120]  and government gets the other half
[50:36.120 --> 50:38.120]  and as he said it's a whole new
[50:38.120 --> 50:40.120]  income tax
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  what do you think it is when they've shut down
[50:42.120 --> 50:44.120]  400 power plants
[50:44.120 --> 50:46.120]  his first four years the last two
[50:46.120 --> 50:48.120]  another 300 or so they're set to shut down
[50:48.120 --> 50:50.120]  1000 more in his last two years
[50:50.120 --> 50:52.120]  look it up just type in Obama
[50:52.120 --> 50:54.120]  EPA set
[50:54.120 --> 50:56.120]  to close a thousand plants
[50:56.120 --> 50:58.120]  folks that's like half of what's left
[50:58.120 --> 51:00.120]  I mean people say I don't care
[51:00.120 --> 51:02.120]  about a power plant you buy electricity
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.120]  from it bozo
[51:04.120 --> 51:06.120]  and I'm not talking to our regular
[51:06.120 --> 51:08.120]  listeners I'm talking to folks that send me emails
[51:08.120 --> 51:10.120]  well I don't care there it is
[51:10.120 --> 51:12.120]  EPA plan to curb new coal fired power plants
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.120]  shut down
[51:14.120 --> 51:16.120]  or not allowed to open 1000
[51:18.120 --> 51:20.120]  oh it makes me remember Obama said
[51:20.120 --> 51:22.120]  if you want to build a coal plant that's fine
[51:22.120 --> 51:24.120]  you
[51:24.120 --> 51:26.120]  so
[51:26.120 --> 51:28.120]  and they can argue well we were
[51:28.120 --> 51:30.120]  over consuming we're hurting the earth it's not
[51:30.120 --> 51:32.120]  even about that though it's about screwing
[51:32.120 --> 51:34.120]  everyone over
[51:34.120 --> 51:36.120]  they're moving our jobs to China where they open
[51:36.120 --> 51:38.120]  multiple coal power plants
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.120]  get this a week and we're
[51:40.120 --> 51:42.120]  having them shut down every week
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.120]  so see if it's one earth they have
[51:44.120 --> 51:46.120]  totally dirty no scrubbers
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.120]  on the smokestacks pure mercury garbage
[51:48.120 --> 51:50.120]  goes out what comes out of ours
[51:50.120 --> 51:52.120]  the last 20 years nothing
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.120]  but water vapor they have sensors on them
[51:54.120 --> 51:56.120]  with carbon dioxide and I obsess over
[51:56.120 --> 51:58.120]  this because I own zero coal stock
[51:58.120 --> 52:00.120]  my family has a few gas wells
[52:00.120 --> 52:02.120]  that competes directly with coal
[52:02.120 --> 52:04.120]  clean burning natural gas
[52:06.120 --> 52:08.120]  and coal is actually what keeps natural gas
[52:08.120 --> 52:10.120]  prices down in competition
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.120]  and so the gas industry
[52:12.120 --> 52:14.120]  and the Saudi Arabians
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.120]  have been dumping billions
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.120]  in to shutting down coal in fact that's
[52:18.120 --> 52:20.120]  mainly who's behind it looking up
[52:20.120 --> 52:22.120]  so see if I thought
[52:22.120 --> 52:24.120]  like the average scumbag corporate guy
[52:24.120 --> 52:26.120]  I'd go
[52:26.120 --> 52:28.120]  first I would imagine that I was like some gas
[52:28.120 --> 52:30.120]  baron
[52:30.120 --> 52:32.120]  and then I would go yeah
[52:32.120 --> 52:34.120]  good yeah I mean I
[52:34.120 --> 52:36.120]  I would go to gas council
[52:36.120 --> 52:38.120]  you know meetings and you know
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.120]  hang out in the foyer like I was part of it
[52:40.120 --> 52:42.120]  and come scurrying in and lobby
[52:42.120 --> 52:44.120]  yeah let's shut down coal
[52:44.120 --> 52:46.120]  yeah let's let's have the
[52:46.120 --> 52:48.120]  most good clean energy we can have
[52:48.120 --> 52:50.120]  and coal is one of the best
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.120]  and natural gas is great as well
[52:52.120 --> 52:54.120]  great to run your cars on it I don't see
[52:54.120 --> 52:56.120]  the infrastructure being put in and all you
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.120]  people that shake your finger at me
[52:58.120 --> 53:00.120]  when you pull up at the front you know front
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.120]  parking and you get out of your electric
[53:02.120 --> 53:04.120]  car and you go plug it in
[53:04.120 --> 53:06.120]  they've done studies
[53:06.120 --> 53:08.120]  you can look them up that they use as much
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.120]  or more some studies a little bit less
[53:10.120 --> 53:12.120]  but generally it's about as much
[53:12.120 --> 53:14.120]  there's almost no difference
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.120]  depending on which way you go with which studies
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.120]  they're almost the same
[53:18.120 --> 53:20.120]  of the amount of carbon created
[53:20.120 --> 53:22.120]  on an electric car
[53:22.120 --> 53:24.120]  versus gasoline
[53:24.120 --> 53:26.120]  car I'm sorry
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.120]  I'm scientific I'm sorry I mean I'm sorry
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.120]  I'm informed
[53:30.120 --> 53:32.120]  if you come out with electric cars that are
[53:32.120 --> 53:34.120]  great and are cheaper and work
[53:34.120 --> 53:36.120]  good I'll buy one I'm not against your electric
[53:36.120 --> 53:38.120]  car I want I got solar panels
[53:40.120 --> 53:42.120]  I got a well a shotgun rifle
[53:42.120 --> 53:44.120]  and a four-wheel drive
[53:44.120 --> 53:46.120]  and a cattle ranch to boot
[53:48.120 --> 53:50.120]  I'm self-sufficient
[53:50.120 --> 53:52.120]  my family does
[53:52.120 --> 53:54.120]  the point is is that
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.120]  it's all a giant fraud
[53:56.120 --> 53:58.120]  and he should be impeached for the fraud
[53:58.120 --> 54:00.120]  I mean if they brought in these witnesses
[54:00.120 --> 54:02.120]  and brought in Gruber who's in the room with Obama coming up with the lies
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.120]  Gruber says he came up
[54:04.120 --> 54:06.120]  helped Obama come up with the lies
[54:06.120 --> 54:08.120]  that's really what that video says
[54:08.120 --> 54:10.120]  Gruber confesses
[54:10.120 --> 54:12.120]  to creating lies with Obama
[54:12.120 --> 54:14.120]  the video is going up on info wars.com
[54:14.120 --> 54:16.120]  it's sensational
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.120]  because they know people are ignorant and don't go look into this
[54:20.120 --> 54:22.120]  so they're like is Alex telling the truth or is Gruber
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.120]  who has the nicest tie
[54:24.120 --> 54:26.120]  who looks the most official well Alex doesn't
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  look as official
[54:28.120 --> 54:30.120]  so I'm gonna go with Gruber
[54:30.120 --> 54:32.120]  you know I love Obama
[54:32.120 --> 54:34.120]  but see when Gruber comes out and says ah you stupid idiot
[54:34.120 --> 54:36.120]  you schmuck
[54:36.120 --> 54:38.120]  I con you you idiot
[54:40.120 --> 54:42.120]  the Democrats are going what
[54:42.120 --> 54:44.120]  I did notice my
[54:44.120 --> 54:46.120]  I mean I know maids and people
[54:48.120 --> 54:50.120]  I know a bunch of folks who make like $20 an hour
[54:52.120 --> 54:54.120]  and they've got insurance and they live humbly
[54:54.120 --> 54:56.120]  but they live pretty good going on a few vacations
[54:56.120 --> 54:58.120]  got a decent car
[54:58.120 --> 55:00.120]  and give them some money to just humble
[55:00.120 --> 55:02.120]  frugal people and they cry
[55:02.120 --> 55:04.120]  now they can't get insurance
[55:04.120 --> 55:06.120]  and they were happy
[55:06.120 --> 55:08.120]  they had jobs they could live
[55:08.120 --> 55:10.120]  they could you know
[55:10.120 --> 55:12.120]  they can't school teachers
[55:12.120 --> 55:14.120]  that are making even $15-60 grand a year
[55:14.120 --> 55:16.120]  are being kicked off they're now
[55:16.120 --> 55:18.120]  talent teachers are going to be substitute now
[55:18.120 --> 55:20.120]  are going to be part time all over the country
[55:20.120 --> 55:22.120]  and they're going to their union saying you be your Democrats
[55:22.120 --> 55:24.120]  you're supposed to protect them
[55:24.120 --> 55:26.120]  they're like sorry honey
[55:26.120 --> 55:28.120]  all these Barton spring Democrats came up to me
[55:28.120 --> 55:30.120]  when it went in last year
[55:30.120 --> 55:32.120]  I was back down I was going there almost every day and swimming
[55:32.120 --> 55:34.120]  last year
[55:34.120 --> 55:36.120]  maybe 15-20 times so I used to go almost every day
[55:36.120 --> 55:38.120]  and swim up to two miles
[55:38.120 --> 55:40.120]  and
[55:40.120 --> 55:42.120]  these liberals all ran up to me
[55:42.120 --> 55:44.120]  not just the lifeguards but liberal Austin
[55:44.120 --> 55:46.120]  I just went listen I know you're a good guy
[55:46.120 --> 55:48.120]  not like a right wing extremist or anything
[55:48.120 --> 55:50.120]  but you know I kind of I'm going to get guns now
[55:50.120 --> 55:52.120]  I agree with you
[55:52.120 --> 55:54.120]  and I'm like why
[55:54.120 --> 55:56.120]  I just got put to part time
[55:56.120 --> 55:58.120]  and I had no exaggeration probably
[55:58.120 --> 56:00.120]  10 lifeguards in one day
[56:00.120 --> 56:02.120]  they come up during a busy summer day
[56:02.120 --> 56:04.120]  and the manager and all of them they go you're right
[56:04.120 --> 56:06.120]  they're cutting us all to part time now
[56:06.120 --> 56:08.120]  20 hours
[56:08.120 --> 56:10.120]  so that they don't have to pay
[56:10.120 --> 56:12.120]  for Obamacare
[56:12.120 --> 56:14.120]  and I went I know it's meant to bankrupt the country
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.120]  I'm sorry
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.120]  I'm sorry
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.120]  it's a year round pool
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.120]  in the summer they got like 15-20 lifeguards
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.120]  they're in the winter only 5 or 6 but
[56:24.120 --> 56:26.120]  I
[56:26.120 --> 56:28.120]  tried to help you and not because I'm a hero
[56:28.120 --> 56:30.120]  I don't want to be screwed either
[56:30.120 --> 56:32.120]  I read the bill I looked at the subsections
[56:32.120 --> 56:34.120]  we told you the truth
[56:36.120 --> 56:38.120]  we didn't want you to get conned we're not like that
[56:38.120 --> 56:40.120]  we don't sit around behind the scenes going
[56:40.120 --> 56:42.120]  we sit around behind the scenes going
[56:42.120 --> 56:44.120]  how can we really tell the truth how can we be hardcore
[56:44.120 --> 56:46.120]  you know this is dangerous
[56:46.120 --> 56:48.120]  what we're about to say but we got to do it
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.120]  we take risk to tell you the truth
[56:50.120 --> 56:52.120]  by the way
[56:52.120 --> 56:54.120]  the best sales pitch out there
[56:54.120 --> 56:56.120]  is to say you're selling out of something
[56:56.120 --> 56:58.120]  a Christmas toy scenario where the company
[56:58.120 --> 57:00.120]  will go out with a newscaster and say they've sold out
[57:00.120 --> 57:02.120]  there's people fighting over the turbo toy
[57:02.120 --> 57:04.120]  or whatever they made movies about it
[57:04.120 --> 57:06.120]  fictitious movies about real events
[57:06.120 --> 57:08.120]  we really
[57:08.120 --> 57:10.120]  are selling out of secret 12
[57:10.120 --> 57:12.120]  this proprietary most powerful form
[57:12.120 --> 57:14.120]  of vitamin B12 out there bar done
[57:14.120 --> 57:16.120]  it's the same type you inject basically
[57:16.120 --> 57:18.120]  and you're able to absorb it it's vegan based
[57:18.120 --> 57:20.120]  much more absorbable than any other sublingual
[57:20.120 --> 57:22.120]  you know taking it in the mouth under the tongue
[57:22.120 --> 57:24.120]  thing out there
[57:24.120 --> 57:26.120]  and we've never had something sell like this
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.120]  we had a limited run of it
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  it will sell out
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.120]  I would guess by Monday morning
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.120]  we're fighting to get more in
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.120]  so it'll probably just be sold out for a few weeks
[57:36.120 --> 57:38.120]  but if you want your secret 12
[57:38.120 --> 57:40.120]  that you've seen me taking the last four months on air
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.120]  but I couldn't tell you what it was

[57:54.120 --> 57:56.120]  X2, nascent iodine
[57:56.120 --> 57:58.120]  because of the 10% off we have

[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:56.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.120 --> 02:00:03.120]  Hi, I'm Janet Napolitano, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:29.120]  Homeland Security begins with hometown security.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:55.120]  How fast you move determines how long you live.
[02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:03.120]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:31.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:33.120]  We are here, live.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:36.120]  We've got some phone calls we're unable to get to when Ventura was on.
[02:01:36.120 --> 02:01:41.120]  I wish I had gone to coach, but I, you know, Jesse thinks the earth's changing
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:43.120]  and doesn't support the carbon taxes.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.120]  He just thinks we're hurting the earth.
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.120]  And I told him, I don't agree with everything Ventura says.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:48.120]  I should have gone to this call.
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  I overlooked it.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:53.120]  Next time he's on, I promise I will raise this point for Ventura.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:57.120]  But coach wanted to know why Jesse supports global warming agenda.
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.120]  Go ahead, coach, and make your point.
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:05.120]  Yeah, I mean, despite the fact that the founder of the weather channel, you know,
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:08.120]  says that it's all a bunch of bullocks, you know, he supports it.
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.120]  You know, and I love Jesse and I respect Jesse.
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:14.120]  So I kind of wanted to know, you know, why he supports that agenda.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  However, I do have another point that I've been trying to get a hold of you for a very long time.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.120]  And that's, you know, solutions.
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:26.120]  A lot of people call your show and they ask, what can I do?
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.120]  And you always give them good advice, you know, to, you know, put the word out and all that stuff.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:34.120]  But we know you and I both know, Alex, that this is going to collapse.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.120]  Our system is going to collapse.
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:42.120]  So my solution is I think we should facilitate that collapse in the big four banks.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:46.120]  All of your listeners should pool every bit of money that they have out of those big four banks.
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:51.120]  If you have a loan with that bank, you should refinance to a different bank and create a bank run.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:54.120]  I don't get their attention in my opinion.
[02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:57.120]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:03.120]  And we have to get the attention to the establishment to stop trying to start nuclear war with Russia,
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:09.120]  to stop funding al-Qaeda, to stop, you know, they go on TV and brag that Obamacare is a scam.
[02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:15.120]  I mean, think about that and laugh at us how they lied to us and then it isn't repealed because of the Republicans.
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:17.120]  We have to shake these people up.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.120]  Now, Hitler had to get shaken up with armies coming in on him.
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:24.120]  I mean, governments go crazy.
[02:03:24.120 --> 02:03:26.120]  They think they're godlike.
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:29.120]  The corporations running it think they're not going to get in trouble.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.120]  Trying to leverage U.S. wealth and capital to take over the planet while bankrupting us.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:38.120]  And it's just, and it's not just the corporations and the government.
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.120]  The people themselves have gotten decadent.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.120]  We all have.
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:50.120]  We've been living in such free countries with so much wealth for so long that we just stopped being serious people.
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  And started letting people do bad stuff.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:04:01.120]  And nobody's been watching this, you know, the shop and the inmates are running the asylum.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:04.120]  So I don't just sit here and blame the whole system.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:10.120]  I blame myself as well, even though I've been fighting to Ernie for 22 years, 20 years on air.
[02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:12.120]  That's what it comes down to.
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have pharmacist Ben Fuchs coming up.
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:21.120]  That's going to be a very informative interview to get a bunch of different medical news.
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:25.120]  We'll continue with your phone calls and we'll take phone calls.
[02:04:25.120 --> 02:04:30.120]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs on any questions you've got about vitamins, minerals, drugs that are out there.
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.120]  We're going to talk about a host of issues with him.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.120]  Getting us some economic news as well.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:40.120]  Straight ahead, the news websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:04:40.120 --> 02:04:43.120]  And we are broadcasting worldwide live on this Friday edition.
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.120]  I'll be back live in studio this Sunday.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:49.120]  Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m. Central and the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock.

[02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:17.120]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:22.120]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:27.120]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:30.120]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:17.120]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:25.120]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly. I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis. Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.120]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days, rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:40.120]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:43.120]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed. We will take all weapons.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:50.120]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in. Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.120]  Enough. Enough. Enough. Enough.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.120]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.120]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:09.120]  Anastasia's late news 12th Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem. Us.
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:14.120]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents,
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:18.120]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:23.120]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:30.120]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:35.120]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:40.120]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:53.120]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:10:01.120]  I am in my apartment, sir. I am inside. I have two words for you. Predator gloves.
[02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:06.120]  You will never see it coming.
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:11.120]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras, parents grabbing their children and running
[02:10:11.120 --> 02:10:18.120]  after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face to face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:24.120]  They let them in the area. They told them they could come in and now they're coming in like they're trespassers punching and shoving people.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:32.120]  We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want a commentator.
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:56.120]  We are on the march. The Empire is on the run. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:02.120]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.120]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:18.120]  I can't believe I'm doing a Nickelback video.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:28.120]  Well, it looks as if the apocalypse may finally be upon us.
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:36.120]  Nickelback is releasing their eighth studio album titled No Fixed Address, which will feature their new single, Edge of a Revolution.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:47.120]  That's right. The Vanilla Wal-Mart rockers from Canada are telling you it's time to stick your fist in the air and call for a revolution.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:54.120]  The lead singer, who now looks like actor Tim Roth, who borrowed a jacket from Bruce Springsteen, says the song touches upon the fat cats on Wall Street
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:59.120]  and inspired from current events as the war in Ukraine and how the government treats its citizens.
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:07.120]  But before we analyze this anthem for the people, written and produced by the biggest corporate rock act of the last 20 years, let's enjoy another snippet.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:13.120]  What do we want? Oh, we want change. And how are we going to get their revolution?
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:24.120]  Feeling inspired and revolutionary? Well, I have to admit, the song is pretty catchy, especially with that anthem at the end, and that video editing is really slick.
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:27.120]  But let's look at the inspiration for this song.
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:36.120]  As we've been pointing out all along, George Soros was involved in the coup in Ukraine, and he even admitted this in May to CNN's Fareed Zakaria.
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:44.120]  Zakaria asked Soros, first on Ukraine, one of the things that many people recognized about you was that you, during the revolutions of 1989,
[02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:51.120]  funded a lot of dissonant activities, civil society groups in Eastern Europe and Poland and the Czech Republic. Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:13:00.120]  Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia, and that foundation has been functioning ever since and played an important part in events now.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:09.120]  Soros responded, sorry, Nickelback, but I don't think a billionaire and admitted Nazi collaborator is interested in freedom or change or whatever the hell you're singing about.
[02:13:12.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  And as for the Fat Cats on Wall Street reference, the video flashes Occupy over and over again throughout different parts of the video,
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:24.120]  and seems to be paying homage to the Occupy Wall Street movement, which started back in 2011.
[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:31.120]  Its origins can be traced to the anti-consumerism magazine, Adbusters, who have since claimed they had nothing to do with it.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:38.120]  Basically, the Occupy movement was started by foundations in order to take the heat off the in the Fed movement, which was gaining steam with the people.
[02:13:38.120 --> 02:13:43.120]  And when the Obama administration could not control the movement, it was attacked and decimated.
[02:13:43.120 --> 02:13:46.120]  I'm not attacking the people who had participated in Occupy Wall Street.
[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:53.120]  There were a lot of good people involved who saw the system sucking off them, but capitalism is what built the foundation of this entire society.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:14:00.120]  Now, it's not perfect by any stretch, but when you have the government picking winners and losers, you will never have freedom, you only have tyranny.
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  And what we have now is a festering fascistic system called crony capitalism.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:09.120]  So you have Nickelback paying homage to two foundation-funded fake movements.
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.120]  What do you expect from a band who sings mostly about strippers and drinking?
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:18.120]  And if you think foundation-funded movements are harmless, look into the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace.
[02:14:18.120 --> 02:14:26.120]  One of its first moves was to lobby Woodrow Wilson not to end World War I too early so they could fundamentally change America.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.120]  Now, Nickelback did get it right with how the government treats its people. They mentioned the NSA.
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:37.120]  And recently, an Obamacare architect got caught on tape saying the stupidity of the American people got Obamacare passed.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:43.120]  The lack of transparency is a huge political advantage and basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever.
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:47.120]  But basically, that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  And for years, we've been documenting the rise of the police state.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:58.120]  While I was watching the edge of a revolution video, this is kind of how I imagine the song and video were inspired.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:07.120]  Hey marketing team, we gots to get a new album out for the remaining Nickelback fans that are left. Any ideas?
[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:14.120]  Well, people seem to be into revolution. Even our blue-collar fan base is angry.
[02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:20.120]  Yeah, revolution. That's a no-brainer.
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:26.120]  Uh, Mr. Moneybags, my cousin used to be in this thing called, uh, Occupy.
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:30.120]  Occupy? Yeah, add that in the video.
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  We'll make people think our corporate rock star cutouts really care about the people that had this vanilla rock forced on them.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:43.120]  I'm getting visions of more records being sold and more money in my bags.
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.120]  I like money.
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  Uh, Mr. Moneybags, no one but trendies and DJs buy records.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:57.120]  Techno, that's it. The next Nickelback record will be Techno.
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:07.120]  Enjoy your corporately created revolution brought to you by the 2011 number one musical turnoff and the band that was voted the second worst band of the 90s, Nickelback.
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:16.120]  And all you Nickelheads out there, before you start writing in the comments telling me how much you hate me, read a little bit about the tax-free foundations in the links provided below.
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:18.120]  You just might learn something.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:26.120]  And this is Rob Dew for Infowars Nightly News and Infowars.com. If you are watching this on YouTube, please consider becoming a member of PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:39.120]  The new album drops November 17th, so get ready for an onslaught of rapid Nickelback songs to flood corporate radio.
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:57.120]  We try to do entertainment coverage here. Now for the rest of the hour, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs joins us. We appreciate him coming on the transmission.
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:01.120]  I want to get into digestive system and mood and brain health.
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:09.120]  I want to talk about digestive system and skin health, weight gain and digestion, a lot of secrets out there that are pretty well known to folks that have investigated.
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:13.120]  Because we also want to talk about solutions here of trying to get our lives together.
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:20.120]  And I've been following all the stuff that Pharmacist Ben Fuchs has been talking about for about three years now, working with Dr. Group and others.
[02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:24.120]  But Fuchs has also been advising me and it's really helped me.
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:33.120]  I have lost tons of weight, people can see it, feel great, have more energy with really simple things. And a lot of it's getting my gut in line.
[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:40.120]  So we're going to discuss that. We're also going to talk about this article, Our Probiotics, The New Prozac.
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:46.120]  Think twice how the gut's second brain influences mood and well-being. Scientific American.
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:52.120]  Yeah, there's a brain in the gut basically. We're going to talk about all those secrets and more with Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:17:52.120 --> 02:17:54.120]  Ben, great to have you with us.
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.120]  Thank you. Good to see you again, Alex.
[02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:59.120]  Wow, so much happening. Where do you want to start when we come back from this break?
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:07.120]  Well, you know, I always say that health should be simple. And there's nothing more simple when it comes to how we live our lives than the food that we eat.
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:16.120]  We have such control over what we put into our mouth. And when you understand that the foods that we eat have an impact on our health and on our longevity and on our disease states.
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:28.120]  And then you combine that with the element of choice, lifestyle choice. It seems like a no-brainer to try to at least understand the impact that foods have on our bodies, on our mentality, on our emotions, as well as on our physical well-being.
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:34.120]  Well, that's right. Separately, your take on Ebola for a minute or two. They claim no more cases this week.
[02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:42.120]  We've talked to medical doctors and others, a bunch of them, and Forbes admitted they were in a meeting with the media and they said, no, we're going to cover up what the government believes are cases.
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:45.120]  Regardless, they're disappearing people. What do you think's really happening?
[02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:54.120]  Two words here, Alex. Immune system defenses. And we're going to get into talking about that, I hope. The gut is the house of your immune system. It's the bulk of your immune system.
[02:18:54.120 --> 02:19:06.120]  70 to 80% of your immunity is located in your gut. Fighting viruses, fighting bacteria, fighting toxicity, detoxification, all of this mandates that we take care of our immune system, which means take care of our gut.
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:21.120]  So if you're worried about the flu virus, HIV virus, Ebola virus, a shingles virus, now that's all in the news, you can do no better than take care of the immune system in your gut by making better food choices using probiotics as well as other nutritional supplements.
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:36.120]  Well, that's right. And again, most of our listeners know this, but a lot of new listeners don't. This is revolutionary stuff. And I knew all this knowledge years ago, but I just didn't follow it. Following it has changed my life. I want to discuss this all with pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:45.120]  He's the host of Right Side for an hour every day right before my syndicated broadcast, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and he's picked up by a lot of stations across the country putting a lot of our affiliates.
[02:19:45.120 --> 02:19:55.120]  We're very excited to have him here with us today. And we'll also open the phones up for your health questions for him coming up in a few segments from now. Stay with us.

Previous usage of antibiotics or steroids for exposure to mercury or other toxins can damage many cells in the GI tract and body that make you prone to Candida overgrowth.

[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:11.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:50.120]  Now, I'm going to give pharmacist Ben Fuchs the floor in the next segment. I'll be here, but if I end up talking any, I'll end up taking over. I want to give him an 18-minute run coming up the next long segment to really drill into this because Bill and Melinda Gates are investing in weather control, genetic engineering, you name it.
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:25:01.120]  But their biggest investment in the last two years is gut flora. They know the BT corn, they own part of Monsanto and the rest of it is manipulating the gut. They know this is all happening.
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:19.120]  And the gut, as our other guests have said, has basically connections to the spine to the brain. The two are connected. Autism with gut flora problems is connected to what's happened with the kids along with vaccines. Think twice how the gut's second brain influences mood and well-being. Scientific American.
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:37.120]  Our probiotics, the new Prozac. The gut brain axis can, probiotics affect your mood. Potential probiotic effects go beyond gut. How your skin health reflects your, I mean, this is everything I heard Fuchs saying six years ago, five years ago when I first became aware of him.
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:51.120]  And then now, this year, more and more of it is coming out. Very exciting. So this is a short segment. You've got the floor getting into this. And we're not even selling probiotics. I don't even have a probiotic, folks.
[02:25:51.120 --> 02:26:05.120]  I mean, even though B12, secret 12, I mean, is a probiotic overall, it's on a microbe. Explain to people what probiotics are. And I know they know what they are basically, but larger sense how the gut works.
[02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:20.120]  Alex, probiotics are so cool for on so many levels. First of all, how interesting is it that our, our entire lives are run by these little tiny bacteria that live in our gut. Trillions of bacteria. Do you know there's 10 times more bacterial cells in your body than there are human cells?
[02:26:20.120 --> 02:26:37.120]  So in many ways, we're just like carrying cases for these bacteria. Now, what do these bacteria do? Well, they make vitamins. They detoxify food. They help us derive energy from our food. They fight cancer. They communicate with the cells of our intestine to accelerate the healing process.
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:53.120]  And one of the coolest aspects of these gut bacteria is they act as a repository of genetic material that can literally be shared with our own genes. In other words, we transfer genes from our bacteria to arts, to our own cells.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:27:07.120]  In essence, we are a form of walking bacteria via these interactions. And almost everything we do on a regular basis conspires to kill off these incredibly critical elements that live in our digestive tract.
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  I'm talking chlorine and food, chlorine and water. I'm talking fluoride and water. I'm talking antibiotics that we take intentionally. I'm talking antibiotics that we take unintentionally. Antibiotics and fish and in dairy and in meat. All of these conspire to kill off the probiotics, which for most of us are already deficient because of how we, because of the birth process.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:40.120]  You know, one third of Americans are born caesarean section and now we have voluntary caesareans where people are getting caesarean sections just so they don't have scarring on their bellies.
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:47.120]  This is the latest trend in Hollywood to have an early caesarean section and pretty soon the average person is going to be encouraged to have a caesarean section.
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:28:07.120]  When a baby is born, Alex, it comes out of the womb and it's supposed to be bathed with a coating of bacteria. That coating of bacteria that comes in from the mother's birth canal as the baby passes through goes into the baby's nose and into the baby's mouth and it goes down the baby's digestive tract and implants in that baby's intestine.
[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:21.120]  And from that point forward, those bacteria become that baby's personal and I mean personal health angels. In the future, we'll actually be able to identify individual human beings by their specific bacterial population.
[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:36.120]  By the way, the bacterial population is technically called the microbiome and the microbiome, this universe of bacteria that lives in our gut that's responsible for so many aspects of good health is supposed to begin at the point we enter into the world.
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:54.120]  As we leave the birth canal and go into life. Now, if your born caesarean section, if a baby's born caesarean section, a third of babies are and more, the numbers are growing, that baby's going to be deprived of those initial bacteria and that means from that point forward that baby's health is going to be compromised.
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:29:07.120]  It gets even worse because the baby's digestive tract and the bacteria that have implanted or theoretically have implanted in the baby's digestive tract are supposed to proliferate via the activity of breast milk.
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:08.120]  That's one of the main roles of breast milk.
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:14.120]  But we don't give them that and then they eat GMO corn that has pesticide in it that kills the good bacteria.
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:24.120]  All of it. So here's the deal, Alex. The baby's a day old, two days old, a week old. His health is already compromised for the rest of his life and the baby hasn't even gotten out of the...
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:32.120]  They're not getting the colostrum. They're not getting the bacterial coat of all their mother's immunities. They're not sinking with mama.
[02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:39.120]  And of course the medical system at the top has no idea what's going on. It's all been planned and we even have all the documents.
[02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:44.120]  The average doctor doesn't know though their compartmentalized pharmacist Ben Fuchs is going to be hosting when he comes back.
[02:29:44.120 --> 02:30:13.120]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:26.120]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives, or worse.
[02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:33.120]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep. Oxy powder does not require time off work.
[02:30:33.120 --> 02:30:35.120]  And there's no need for bad taste incongructions.
[02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:41.960]  Instead, Oxipowder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:46.680]  Experience the astonishing cleansing power of superoxide and azanide technology.
[02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:56.280]  Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get started with Oxipowder or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:59.960]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:04.320]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:08.880]  When you put two and two together, Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including
[02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:13.920]  hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced and fully legal.

[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:25.800]  Body Armor just won't quit.

[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:36.840]  what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic supermail vitality formula.
[02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:42.800]  Supermail vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[02:31:55.320 --> 02:32:01.200]  Aging starts at the cellular level, when cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets
[02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:02.200]  in.
[02:32:02.200 --> 02:32:06.720]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:11.880]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve
[02:32:11.880 --> 02:32:13.920]  growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:19.240]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth
[02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:23.160]  factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:29.880]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:36.280]  is backed by major clinical studies, and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[02:33:12.280 --> 02:33:18.560]  Alright, thank you so much guys, thank you InfoWarriors, and thank you Alex, it's an
[02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:21.560]  honor to be sitting in for you here for the next 18 minutes or so, so I was just going
[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:25.320]  to continue talking about the importance of gut health, and you guys who have listened
[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:29.280]  to me on the bright side, you know that I love the simplicity of health.
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:34.560]  We get so confused by all the different aspects of disease states and all the different body
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:39.040]  parts and all the different chemical reactions and all the different molecular aspects of
[02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:42.560]  the human body that we forget that health is really a simple matter.
[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:46.760]  I call it the triangle of disease or the triangle of wellness depending on how you look at it.
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:52.080]  Fix your digestive system, stabilize your blood sugar system, and relax the adrenal
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.080]  glands.
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:55.920]  And it's really not a very difficult process, and once you start to do all of these things,
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:59.520]  beginning with digestive health, you'll notice that whatever your health condition is, whether
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:05.360]  it's something as benign, something as mild as acne or psoriasis or something as horrific
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:11.280]  as heart disease or cancer, symptoms will begin to ameliorate, mitigate, reduce, and
[02:34:11.280 --> 02:34:16.000]  ultimately you can reverse any health challenge, any health challenge.
[02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.320]  Even cancer, even stage 4 cancer has a history of remission, not that everybody remits, but
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:26.080]  people have remitted, and if one human being can remit, any human being can remit.
[02:34:26.080 --> 02:34:27.080]  So how do you do it?
[02:34:27.080 --> 02:34:31.480]  If you're dealing with a degenerative health crisis, if you're dealing with autoimmune
[02:34:31.480 --> 02:34:35.640]  disease, if you're dealing with a skin condition, what are the practical steps that you can
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:36.640]  take?
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:40.120]  Well, first and foremost, you've got to address digestive health.
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:43.040]  We are manipulated by food.
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:47.400]  We have an empire of food, and it's been that way historically, since the days of Sumeria
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:52.960]  going into ancient Egypt and then Rome and then Europe, and now the American empire.
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:58.920]  Humanity has been manipulated by food for eons for 10,000 or 12,000 years.
[02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:06.320]  So getting control of our food, getting control of our digestive health, learning to free
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:11.640]  ourselves from the tyranny and the hegemony of the empires of food is job number one.
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.040]  Not only if we're dealing with a degenerative health crisis, not only if we're dealing with
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:19.040]  a health issue, but simply for longevity.
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:23.040]  Simply if we're healthy and we want to stay healthy, learning how to control digestive
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:24.280]  health is job number one.
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:29.920]  As I was talking before the break, it all begins to tumble out of control woefully early.
[02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:34.240]  As soon as we leave the womb, for many of us, our digestive health becomes compromised
[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:39.840]  because we don't get that bacterial shower that's supposed to occur as we go down the
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:42.920]  birth canal in the birth process.
[02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:43.920]  We go down the birth canal.
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:48.400]  What's supposed to happen is bacteria are supposed to bathe the body, the baby's body,
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:52.680]  and those bacteria go into the baby's nostrils, into the baby's mouth, and plant in the gut.
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:58.120]  And from that point forward, those bacteria become that baby's best health friends.
[02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:03.640]  If that doesn't occur, either because the baby is born cesarean section or because
[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:08.320]  the mother is not healthy and the mother doesn't have the appropriate bacterial flora, that
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:11.280]  baby is going to become immediately compromised.
[02:36:11.280 --> 02:36:16.240]  As the baby goes through life or begins his or her life, the baby's gut is supposed to
[02:36:16.240 --> 02:36:21.680]  be further enhanced and further grow, growth is supposed to further be encouraged by breast
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:22.680]  milk.
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:24.640]  Well, we know one-third of babies aren't breastfed.
[02:36:24.640 --> 02:36:28.160]  So again, the baby becomes compromised at the digestive health level.
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:32.080]  Then the baby, of course, goes into the standard American diet and that's really when it all
[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:33.680]  tumbles out of control.
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:41.280]  And once the digestive system becomes compromised, the baby's and our ability to extract energy
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:44.240]  from food becomes compromised as well.
[02:36:44.240 --> 02:36:51.240]  Once we have a problem extracting energy from food, our blood sugar starts to become unstable.
[02:36:51.240 --> 02:36:55.760]  Once we have problems extracting energy from food and extracting sugars from food, extracting
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:01.280]  nutrients from food, the body's insulin processing and blood sugar processing get thrown off
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:05.040]  and eventually that leads to conditions of low blood sugar and high blood sugar.
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:08.720]  I call it the low blood sugar, high blood sugar roller coaster and eventually that leads
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:14.120]  to diabetes and we all know that diabetes is an epidemic just as much as digestive health
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:15.360]  conditions are epidemic.
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:20.280]  In fact, one-third of Americans are pre-diabetic or diabetic and this is related to obesity.
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:23.720]  In fact, it's related to pretty much almost every health condition you can name.
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:26.960]  The medical model will tell you that there's something called metabolic syndrome.
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:29.600]  Some of you guys may have heard of this condition, metabolic syndrome.
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:35.400]  The syndrome is a disease state that has various different symptoms associated with it.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:41.600]  Metabolic syndrome has symptoms like high blood pressure, obesity, autoimmunity, inflammatory
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:45.160]  diseases, movement disorders, mental health issues.
[02:37:45.160 --> 02:37:50.000]  Basically everything we suffer from is associated with this health condition called metabolic
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  syndrome.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  Well, if you Google metabolic syndrome, you're going to find that metabolic syndrome and
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:00.360]  dysglycemia or messed up blood sugar go hand in hand.
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:04.440]  So you got your digestive system gets whacked out and starts woefully early.
[02:38:04.440 --> 02:38:06.440]  The blood sugar system gets whacked out.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:10.000]  That's the next step and from there you go into almost every single health challenge
[02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  you can name.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.640]  But you know what, guys?
[02:38:12.640 --> 02:38:14.120]  That's great news.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:15.120]  That's not bad news.
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.680]  That's good news because it means that no matter what our health challenges are, we
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:24.200]  have an incredible aspect of control that we can employ.
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:26.240]  We can stabilize our blood sugar.
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:28.240]  We can work on our digestive health.
[02:38:28.240 --> 02:38:31.960]  And once we do that, almost every single health challenge you can name will begin to reverse.
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:34.640]  Now if you want to throw something else in, you can work with the adrenal glands which
[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:37.560]  are linked to the thyroid, but it's not even necessary.
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:41.880]  It's as simple as stabilizing blood sugar and working on digestive health.
[02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:42.880]  So how do you do it?
[02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:46.600]  Well, working backwards with the blood sugar system first, how do you work with the blood
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:47.600]  sugar system?
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:48.600]  How do you stabilize blood sugar?
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:54.480]  One of the most important things you can do to stabilize blood sugar is to eat less calories.
[02:38:54.480 --> 02:38:58.680]  Every time we eat anything, really, but every time we eat the standard American diet most
[02:38:58.680 --> 02:39:01.080]  especially, our blood sugar goes up.
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:05.080]  The body's response to elevated blood sugar is to pull that blood sugar down.
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:07.520]  We get tired or so-called hypoglycemic.
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:09.240]  We end up going to get some more food.
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:11.080]  Our blood sugar goes up.
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:12.640]  Body pulls that blood sugar down.
[02:39:12.640 --> 02:39:16.080]  By the way, sugar represents a toxic element to the body.
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:20.840]  There's very explosive, if you've ever put a marshmallow into a fire and watched that
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:27.920]  marshmallow go poof, you've witnessed visibly how explosive sugar is.
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:32.520]  There's a grain silos in the Midwest that you're not supposed to smoke in because the
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:37.920]  sugar which is the same thing as the grain dust is very, very explosive.
[02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:43.480]  The body has a way of eliminating sugar, of reducing sugar, and it does it very efficiently
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:45.000]  at least at first.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:49.680]  And as this high blood sugar, low blood sugar, roller coaster continues, this is where our
[02:39:49.680 --> 02:39:51.080]  health begins to degenerate.
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:55.680]  So by eating less calories, and I'm talking all calories here really, not just calories
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:39:59.980]  from processed food, by eating less calories we can begin to start to stabilize our blood
[02:39:59.980 --> 02:40:00.980]  sugar.
[02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:06.120]  A second great strategy for stabilizing blood sugar is to eat more protein and to eat more
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:07.120]  good fat.
[02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.040]  Yes, I said eat more good fat.
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:13.720]  Don't pay any attention to the nonsense about keeping your fat intake low as long as that
[02:40:13.720 --> 02:40:15.160]  fat is good.
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:19.520]  Coconut oil, for example, is a stupendously important fat, and not only is it a great
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:24.280]  fat just for giving your body a good source of fat and a good source of vitamin E, and
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:27.600]  a good source of something called medium chain triglycerides, which the body can use very
[02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:35.840]  effectively for energy, but coconut oil is also a great way to stabilize your blood sugar.
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:41.320]  In fact, if you want to eat less food, using a tablespoon or teaspoon full of coconut
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:45.680]  oil before you start your meals, it's a great way to decrease the amount of foods that you
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:48.000]  eat and improve your satiety.
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  By the way, when it comes to eating less calories, I don't like the idea of suffering or struggling.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:59.120]  I like the idea of satiety, of satisfaction, of making sure that you feel satisfied so
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:01.000]  eating less calories is easy.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:07.600]  Remember, your stomach is about this big, size of a fist, it can hold maybe two pints
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:11.280]  of food when it's maxed out, but you don't really need to have two pints of food.
[02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:12.280]  You need to feel satisfied.
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:15.920]  You don't really need to fill up that fist-sized stomach to feel satisfied.
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:19.240]  For most of us, we'll feel satisfied with one or two bites.
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:21.160]  Notice this the next time you're hungry.
[02:41:21.160 --> 02:41:26.680]  Notice the next time you're hungry when you decide to eat that after one bite or two bites,
[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:28.240]  you're pretty much satisfied.
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:29.520]  You pretty much don't need to eat.
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:33.840]  Now, most of us, including myself, will continue eating or basically finish the amount of food
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.680]  on our plate, or we'll just continue eating if we're in a social setting just because
[02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:41.400]  we want to be part of the crowd.
[02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:46.600]  As far as being satisfied, as far as being full, it only takes one or two bites.
[02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:49.720]  Eating less food is one of the most important strategies, not only for stabilizing your
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:53.320]  blood sugar, but for taking the load off of the digestive system.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:58.000]  You can also use micronutrients, that is, vitamins and minerals to help stabilize the
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  blood sugar.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  There's two very important minerals.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.240]  There's actually three very important minerals that are involved with blood sugar control.
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:06.480]  Magnesium is one, chromium is another, vanadium is another.
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.120]  If you go to infowarshealth.com, you'll find a really cool product called Sweet Ease, which
[02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:12.680]  is made with chromium vanadium.
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:17.840]  You'll find another product called the Beyond OsteoFX, which is made with magnesium.
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:21.360]  All three of these minerals are very important for sugar metabolism.
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:25.160]  Zinc is also very important for sugar metabolism, and zinc deficiency, by the way, along with
[02:42:25.160 --> 02:42:30.000]  magnesium deficiencies, are really, really common and very tragically common because
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.480]  they're so easy to replace via supplementation in foods.
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.560]  50 milligrams of zinc per colonnade is a great place to be.
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:38.960]  You always want to balance out your zinc with copper.
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:43.000]  Other nutrients that can help you stabilize sugar, there's an amino acid called taurine.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.520]  Taurine is a little bit difficult to find from foods.
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:50.080]  You'll find taurine in meats and seafood, organ meats.
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:53.160]  High protein foods will typically contain some taurine, but if you want to supplement
[02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:57.960]  with taurine, you can use 100 milligrams of taurine a day, maybe 200 milligrams of taurine
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:42:58.960]  a day.
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:01.560]  Great, great blood sugar stabilizing effects.
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:08.200]  Arginine, another super-duper amino acid, not only important for helping stabilize blood
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:12.200]  sugar, but arginine is also very important for building, for immunity.
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:14.360]  It's got antiviral properties.
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:20.520]  Arginine can also be helpful for helping the body secrete growth hormone, and arginine
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:22.880]  is stupendously important for heart health.
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.400]  These are all, by the way, nutrients whose deficiencies are really common, tragically
[02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:28.400]  common.
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:33.960]  And I'm telling you, as a nutritional pharmacist, as a pharmacist who uses nutrients in my practice,
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:43:39.080]  it's hard for me to believe that these nutritional deficiencies, which are so common, are not
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:45.400]  somewhere located, somewhere behind our absolutely abysmal state of health.
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:48.640]  This is why I have such a problem with physicians and with doctors and with medicalizing.
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:50.640]  We really don't need to be medicalized.
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:51.640]  Yeah, sure.
[02:43:51.640 --> 02:43:55.200]  If you get hit by a car, you get hit by a bus, you have some kind of accident, you may
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:59.800]  need to have some kind of surgical procedure done.
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:01.680]  I call it heroic medicine.
[02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:05.120]  Heroic medicine is where they stitch you up after you have some kind of traumatic injury.
[02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:10.360]  But in terms of chronic, long-term degenerative diseases, the kind of problems most of us
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:14.160]  are dealing with, whether they're blood sugar problems or heart problems or immune system
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:19.840]  problems, these are not issues that we need to be interfacing with the medical model for.
[02:44:19.840 --> 02:44:22.040]  These aren't doctor issues.
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.480]  These are issues that involve lifestyle and lifestyle choices around blood sugar and around
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:30.160]  food and around working with the adrenal glands as well, which hopefully I'll get to here
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:31.160]  in a second.
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:36.680]  So anyway, stabilizing blood sugar, eating less calories, using coconut oil, using micronutrients
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:40.760]  like chromium vanadium, which you'll find in the sweeties, using arginine and taurine.
[02:44:40.760 --> 02:44:47.760]  The B complex, by the way, is stupendously important for blood sugar control, especially
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:51.960]  thiamine, which is vitamin B1, and niacin, which is vitamin B3.
[02:44:51.960 --> 02:44:56.280]  That niacin is actually part of something called the glucose tolerance factor, which
[02:44:56.280 --> 02:45:00.440]  is a complex of chemicals that the body makes in order to process glucose.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:04.240]  Here's the really interesting thing about the B complex.
[02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:10.280]  The B complex is water soluble, which means it dissolves in water, which means it dissolves
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:16.880]  in the watery part of the body, which means it's excreted out of the body every time we
[02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:17.880]  urinate.
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:21.600]  This is so important because every time we go to the bathroom, every time we urinate,
[02:45:21.600 --> 02:45:23.320]  we lose our B complex.
[02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:27.720]  In other words, every time we urinate, we lose our ability to process sugar.
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:32.160]  Oh yeah, by the way, magnesium, which is also important for sugar processing, is water soluble
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:33.160]  too.
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.000]  So we lose our B complex, we lose our niacin, we lose our thiamine, we lose our magnesium
[02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.600]  every time we urinate.
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:42.840]  We lose our ability to process sugar every time we go to the bathroom.
[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:47.280]  Now how many folks are replacing their magnesium every time they go to the bathroom?
[02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:50.720]  How many folks are replacing their B complex every time they go to the bathroom?
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:56.000]  The B complex, by the way, is not just, it's not only important for sugar metabolism, the
[02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.800]  B complex is also important for energy, and it's also important for brain health, and
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:03.920]  it's also important for the immune system, and it's also important for the digestive
[02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:08.280]  system, which means every time we go to the bathroom, we lose our ability or reduce our
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:09.800]  ability to process sugar.
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:15.160]  We reduce our ability to think clearly, we reduce our ability to process foods via the
[02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:16.160]  digestive system.
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:20.640]  In fact, almost every single system in the body, because it depends on the B complex
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:26.200]  of vitamins, becomes compromised when we go to the bathroom if we're not replacing those
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  nutrients.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.200]  And this is one of the reasons why I'm such a big proponent of the beyond tangy tangerine,
[02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:36.600]  which is liquid nutrients, especially liquid B complex, and by the way, liquid B complex
[02:46:36.600 --> 02:46:38.920]  in very high concentrations.
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:43.480]  So controlling your blood sugar by eating less foods, using micronutrients, using liquid
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:47.240]  nutrients, making sure you're on the B complex, job number one.
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:52.440]  Job number two, focus on digestive health, and the same strategies, or some of the same
[02:46:52.440 --> 02:46:56.920]  strategies that you can use for improving sugar control, you can also use for improving
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:00.640]  digestive health, namely eating less food.
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:01.640]  This is so important.
[02:47:01.640 --> 02:47:06.640]  In fact, one of the craziest strategies that we hear we're supposed to do from the mainstream
[02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:09.960]  is to keep eating throughout the day, they call it grazing, some of you probably heard
[02:47:09.960 --> 02:47:13.640]  of this, where you eat five meals a day or six meals a day, and theoretically it's supposed
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:15.160]  to keep your blood sugar stable.
[02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:19.560]  This is one of the craziest medical strategies or health strategies you could ever use, because
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:24.000]  if you do something like eating throughout the day, you never give your digestive system
[02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.000]  a break.
[02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  Can you imagine this?
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:30.960]  For most of us, we've gone cradle to grave without giving our digestive system a break
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:33.360]  for more than one or two hours.
[02:47:33.360 --> 02:47:38.640]  This can do nothing but put a horrific load on the digestive system, and in my opinion,
[02:47:38.640 --> 02:47:43.120]  it's probably behind this idea of eating throughout the day, is probably behind much
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:47.760]  of our health crises, much of our epic, biblical, almost health crises.
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:50.880]  Eating less food, even to the point of fasting.
[02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:53.760]  Some folks will say, oh, I can't do a fast, it's too hard to do a fast.
[02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:54.840]  Guess what?
[02:47:54.840 --> 02:47:59.080]  When you do a fast, something very interesting happens to your brain.
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:07.920]  Examples called orexins, O-R-E-X-I-N-S, or some people call them hypo-cretins, H-Y-P-O-C-R-E-T-I-N-S.
[02:48:07.920 --> 02:48:12.720]  Hypo-cretins or orexins are secreted in the brain in response to fasting.
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:13.720]  Why is this important?
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:17.880]  Well, it turns out that orexins and hypo-cretins give you energy.
[02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:20.520]  They keep you awake, they keep you alert.
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:26.240]  In fact, orexins and hypo-cretins give you so much energy and keep you so alert that
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:32.400]  drug companies are now studying these compounds to use them as the latest form of speed in
[02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:34.720]  order to deal with things like narcolepsy.
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:38.000]  But you can make your own hypo-cretin, you don't need any pharmaceutical hypo-cretin.
[02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.640]  You can make your own orexins, you don't need any pharmaceutical orexins simply by giving
[02:48:42.640 --> 02:48:45.320]  yourself a food holiday, by fasting.
[02:48:45.320 --> 02:48:50.440]  In fact, if you have any kind of inflammatory health condition or autoimmune condition,
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:57.360]  the fastest way to reduce the symptoms and reverse the autoimmune condition itself is
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:58.600]  to stop eating.
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:48:59.600]  You don't believe me?
[02:48:59.600 --> 02:49:00.600]  Try it.
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:01.600]  Do it for one day.
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:05.280]  Watch what happens when you fast for one day if you're dealing with some kind of chronic
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:08.040]  autoimmune condition or chronic inflammatory condition.
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:14.360]  In fact, even WebMD has an article on their website about multiple sclerosis, MS in fasting.
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:16.120]  Fasting improves multiple sclerosis.
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:20.560]  Of course, WebMD is no fan of alternative medicine or nutritional medicine, but even
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:25.400]  they have it on their website about the power of fasting for reducing the symptoms of autoimmunity.
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:30.000]  Again, I don't like struggle, I don't like willpower, I like satiety.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.080]  So if you're trying to fast but you have a problem with it because you just can't force
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:40.600]  yourself to not eat, use soups or use vegetable juices or do what I call, use what I call
[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:45.720]  vegetable waters, vegetable waters where you take cucumber or celery or some kind of vegetable
[02:49:45.720 --> 02:49:49.600]  and you slice it up into thin slices and you put it into some distilled water and you let
[02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:54.360]  the electrolytes seep out of the vegetable, out of the cucumber, out of the celery and
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:55.960]  go into the water.
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:57.480]  You can also use a blender.
[02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:01.880]  If you use a blender with your vegetables, you'll blend up the vegetables and you'll
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:08.360]  spin those electrolytes that are in the vegetables in the vortex and when electrolytes and water
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:12.880]  are spun around in the vortex, they create electrical energy, when you drink that vegetable
[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:18.640]  water that's been blended, you'll get that electrical energy and you'll find that you're
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:20.880]  satisfied to the point where you don't feel like eating.
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:26.360]  So using vegetable waters, using soups, especially what I call bone soup where you take a car
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:27.360]  and stick it.
[02:50:27.360 --> 02:50:28.360]  Hold on, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:29.360]  Hold on.
[02:50:29.360 --> 02:50:30.360]  Hey, I did it.
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:31.360]  18 minutes, I didn't cut into somebody.
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:36.080]  We're going to come right back with Pharmacist Ben Fuchs in the final segment.
[02:50:36.080 --> 02:50:39.040]  This information is so simple but so revolutionary.

[02:52:54.760 --> 02:53:00.280]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes and surroundings without the right equipment.
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:02.000]  You'll never know it's there.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:06.520]  Natural and man-made nuclear radiation can find its way into our living environment.
[02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:11.840]  And maser instruments are your best line of defense, unlike lower cost products.
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:17.560]  Maser instruments detects all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma and
[02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:19.040]  x-rays.
[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:24.000]  Most products require you manually turn them on for each use, but maser instruments are
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  different.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:28.600]  They're designed to be always on, just like your smoke alarm.
[02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:32.360]  Detecting, measuring and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:33.520]  Made in America.
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:39.280]  Maser instruments are laboratory grade, EMP resistant and powered by common 9 volt batteries.
[02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:42.000]  Get the details at maserenstruments.com.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:45.520]  Spelled, M-A-C-U-R, instruments.com.
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:50.040]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[02:53:50.040 --> 02:54:07.640]  But now you can be at maserenstruments.com.
[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:30.320]  Now listen up, she's a razor sharp, she'll slice you apart, lose like a cat, she'll get
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:40.600]  your name, might not make it back, Monday through Friday we're here, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:41.600]  live.
[02:54:41.600 --> 02:54:44.800]  I'll be back this Sunday in studio for a live transmission.
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:48.200]  Sometimes David Knight says send us a great job, sometimes it's taped, most of the time
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:52.400]  it's live, and I'll be live as live last Sunday, be live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:57.920]  Central Standard Time, unless we get snowed in down here, all part of this global warming.
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:03.720]  Coming back to pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, I said earlier, hey, I promote probiotics
[02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:06.720]  even though I don't sell one at inforwarslife.com.
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:10.400]  But then I was looking over here as we're promoting Root Beer Belly and Flora FX from
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  Yongevity at inforwarshealth.com.
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:17.200]  I guess technically I do, but what I mean is I don't really promote it because I end
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:19.800]  up getting brands at Whole Foods and stuff.
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:26.640]  But I have started taking Flora FX and also the enzymes and I really, I don't know about
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:30.040]  these probiotics, so I just take randomly a whole bunch of different ones.
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:32.800]  I don't know if that's probably the best thing I'm doing.
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:35.320]  What's your view on that pharmacist Ben Fuchs?
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:36.960]  There's two ways to do your probiotics.
[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:39.920]  Number one, what you're talking about now by supplementing with them with the Root Beer
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:44.840]  Belly, the Flora FX, there's a product called BioLuminaidliacens, which is a Yongevity product,
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.840]  which is my favorite probiotic, and then there's the second way, which is to eat fermented
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:49.840]  food.
[02:55:49.840 --> 02:55:53.640]  Traditionally, indigenous cultures have always ingested fermented food.
[02:55:53.640 --> 02:55:54.640]  So, shower crowd?
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:55.640]  Exactly.
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:01.000]  So, it's a shower crowd, fermented cabbage, fermented beets, miso, tempeh, pickles, there's
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.640]  so many different ways that you can get fermented food to your diet.
[02:56:03.640 --> 02:56:05.440]  Okay, so I love all that, so I'm good.
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:06.440]  Go crazy with it.
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:08.720]  In fact, you can subsist on it.
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:13.480]  When bacteria act on these foods, they release the nutrients, so they make it easier for
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:17.240]  the body to absorb those nutrients, and that's really what it's all about, Alex.
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:19.440]  Making it easy for the body to get nutrition.
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:22.640]  These are all the things our ancestors developed over thousands of years.
[02:56:22.640 --> 02:56:23.640]  Yes.
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:27.000]  We've been doing it for thousands, for millennia, and it's only been the last 200 years that
[02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:32.160]  we've figured out artificially how to take the nutrients out of food and sell humanity,
[02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:34.920]  the carcass, the dead body of the food.
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:36.200]  You know why they do that, by the way?
[02:56:36.200 --> 02:56:39.920]  Do you know why food processors take the nutrients out of the food and leave us with
[02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:41.120]  the carcass?
[02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:44.840]  It's because when you take the nutrients, the micronutrients, the vitamins, and the
[02:56:44.840 --> 02:56:51.200]  minerals out in the fats out of the foods, and just, no, the foods last longer, the
[02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:52.600]  bugs won't eat them.
[02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:57.040]  The bugs aren't stupid, they're not going to eat food that has no nutritional value.
[02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:01.000]  Only we eat those foods, so the foods have their nutrients removed, so they'll have
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  shelf life.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:03.000]  Oh, exactly.
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:06.240]  That's why they're doing GMO tomatoes and tomatoes, but secondarily, I mean, I know
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:10.200]  McDonald's has admitted this, they like to take the nutrients out, because then, as
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:13.320]  you said, it lasts longer, but also people are hungry again.
[02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:15.440]  And they keep eating over and over and over again.
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:18.640]  This is why people lose weight once they start a micronutrient program.
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.840]  This is why the beyond tangy tangerine causes weight loss, even though you're not really
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:23.840]  a weight loss person.
[02:57:23.840 --> 02:57:27.080]  That's how I first lost my first 25, 30 pounds, and I've lost 20 more.
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:28.400]  You feel satisfied.
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:31.160]  You feel satisfied quicker, and that's really what it's all about.
[02:57:31.160 --> 02:57:37.320]  I was saying before you, when you were gone, it's not about willpower, it's about satisfaction.
[02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:40.280]  And satisfaction is regulated by nutrient content.
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:44.320]  A little less talk, a little more action, satisfaction, absolutely.
