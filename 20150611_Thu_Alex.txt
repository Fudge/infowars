[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Third day, Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:25.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:25.840 --> 00:26.840]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26.840 --> 00:31.920]  Welcome to thank you for joining us for another groundbreaking trailblazing tip of the spear
[00:31.920 --> 00:39.640]  global transmission fearlessly in the face of the tectonic technocracy takeover, the
[00:39.640 --> 00:42.720]  TTT that we're facing.
[00:42.720 --> 00:48.320]  Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter, who was basically escorted by the police
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.480]  down off the mountain miles away from Bilderberg yesterday, will be joining us to give us his
[00:54.480 --> 01:04.160]  take on the situation as the criminal confab prepares to get underway at noon our time.
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.600]  Already basically going, they begin arriving at noon, it kicks off at about six or seven
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.600]  at night.
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.520]  That's what time it is right now, seven hours ahead in Austria.
[01:12.520 --> 01:17.840]  So it's ongoing right now, we'll learn all the developments of the last 21 hours since
[01:17.840 --> 01:20.920]  we were live here with our reporters.
[01:20.920 --> 01:23.080]  There's the front page, London Guardian.
[01:23.080 --> 01:28.920]  At the G seven, we journalists were pampered at Bilderberg were harassed by police.
[01:28.920 --> 01:35.320]  So that's coming up Larry claiming founder of judicial watch heads of freedom watch USA
[01:35.320 --> 01:41.000]  has a cornucopia of breaking Intel that he's going to be joining us.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.480]  We know that two members of the US Supreme Court are being targeted by spies.
[01:45.480 --> 01:47.640]  And it's all part of a larger blackmail operation.
[01:47.640 --> 01:54.400]  This is over the top important information with Larry claiming a true trailblazer joining
[01:54.400 --> 02:00.600]  us in the third hour, Charlie Skelton for 30 minutes, Larry claiming for a full hour.
[02:00.600 --> 02:02.600]  We're working on getting Mark dice right now.
[02:02.600 --> 02:04.400]  We were working on getting him on tomorrow.
[02:04.400 --> 02:08.040]  Well we have him for tomorrow, but I want to move him to today.
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.040]  We're just so busy.
[02:09.040 --> 02:12.320]  We haven't done a story on this, but RT picked it up.
[02:12.320 --> 02:14.880]  He went out talk to Californians Obama voters.
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.360]  I mean, they're the dumbest people on earth.
[02:16.360 --> 02:17.360]  I'm sorry.
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.920]  Conservatives have their problems and can be horrible police state pushers, but they
[02:21.920 --> 02:23.640]  do know how to wipe their butts.
[02:23.640 --> 02:27.400]  And I hate to use that analogy, but man, it's the only one that fits.
[02:27.400 --> 02:29.360]  You go talk to random Californians.
[02:29.360 --> 02:33.400]  They are the stupidest, most fascistic people I've ever seen.
[02:33.400 --> 02:35.400]  And Californians will tell you those aren't Californians.
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.160]  They're idiots that have moved in there looking to get rich quick or whatever.
[02:39.160 --> 02:45.600]  But Obama's zombies American sign prankster petition to nuke Russia.
[02:45.600 --> 02:49.840]  And but I mean, he'll say, we need to put gun owners in forced labor camps.
[02:49.840 --> 02:50.840]  And the liberals would go, absolutely.
[02:50.840 --> 02:51.840]  I'm sick of them.
[02:51.840 --> 02:52.840]  Let's less enslave them.
[02:52.840 --> 02:54.040]  They are ready folks.
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.400]  If they arrest me tomorrow and put me in a forced labor camp, the average Democrat will
[02:58.400 --> 03:00.200]  hail it.
[03:00.200 --> 03:01.720]  Now is that liberal?
[03:01.720 --> 03:04.840]  No, these are sick freaks.
[03:04.840 --> 03:09.080]  I told you I've gone out to abortion clinics and every time people run up and say, I love
[03:09.080 --> 03:10.080]  Satan.
[03:10.080 --> 03:11.080]  I want to kill babies.
[03:11.080 --> 03:14.180]  So I said, we're going to go out to abortion clinic and see what happens.
[03:14.180 --> 03:16.040]  They show up.
[03:16.040 --> 03:20.600]  And I don't care where you're at that these demons come out from under rocks.
[03:20.600 --> 03:23.000]  It's the modus operandi.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  It's criminology.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.880]  It's psychology.
[03:26.880 --> 03:37.040]  The more insane, the more demented, the more demonic a soul is, the more predictable.
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.320]  And we just have to come to grips with how sick these people are.
[03:41.320 --> 03:43.700]  Now real liberals are great people.
[03:43.700 --> 03:48.600]  These folks are not it, but regardless, I'm playing the clip here.
[03:48.600 --> 03:51.600]  And Mark's really good at this because he just driving walks over and goes, turn all
[03:51.600 --> 03:58.400]  the guns in and burn Jews in ovens for Obama, open the borders and bring in world government
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.440]  and then have the communist manifesto be taught for Obama, throw children to woodchippers
[04:03.440 --> 04:04.440]  for Obama.
[04:04.440 --> 04:05.800]  I mean, he could go that far.
[04:05.800 --> 04:12.480]  You say for Obama, they go into mind control, peer pressure, mind control and begin signing.
[04:12.480 --> 04:17.360]  So regardless, let's just get the whole RT article posted at infowars.com and send Drudge
[04:17.360 --> 04:18.360]  a link to it.
[04:18.360 --> 04:21.680]  It'll probably just link to the, if he does, to the RT one.
[04:21.680 --> 04:26.760]  But it is just over the top to see this stuff.
[04:26.760 --> 04:32.000]  Speaking of Drudge, one of our top stories on Bilderberg when we return, it's up on drudgereport.com.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.600]  We're going to move it back to the front page of infowars.com.
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.360]  It broke last night.
[04:36.360 --> 04:39.400]  Bilderberg deploys high tech jamming to shut down communications.
[04:39.400 --> 04:42.320]  Now as soon as I saw the video of it, I knew what it was.
[04:42.320 --> 04:47.120]  Yes, it can jam, but that's not really what it is.
[04:47.120 --> 04:54.400]  It is a giant Stingray system on steroids and in major departments all over the world
[04:54.400 --> 04:55.400]  have these.
[04:55.400 --> 05:08.160]  And we're going to break it down when we come back.
[05:08.160 --> 05:13.960]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[05:13.960 --> 05:42.480]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[05:42.480 --> 05:50.360]  When the ink starts to itch, then the black will turn to red.
[05:50.360 --> 06:00.400]  I was born in the soul of misery, never had me a name.
[06:00.400 --> 06:05.840]  They just gave me the number when I was young.
[06:05.840 --> 06:19.800]  It's Johnny Cash bringing us in 13 got a long line of heartache, I carry it well, the list
[06:19.800 --> 06:26.560]  of lives I've broken reach from here to hell or live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[06:26.560 --> 06:33.240]  to 2 p.m. central bad luck when been blowing at my return weeknight 7 o'clock central infowars
[06:33.240 --> 06:37.440]  nightly news and Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m. central as well.
[06:37.440 --> 06:39.360]  Huge broadcast lined up today.
[06:39.360 --> 06:44.800]  We have Charlie Skelton, London Guardian reporter has been heavily harassed by police.
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.240]  This is best of the worst he's ever seen and he's writing in the Guardian at G7.
[06:50.240 --> 06:52.720]  We journalists were pampered at Bilderberg.
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.040]  We were harassed by police as the headline.
[06:55.040 --> 07:00.280]  He first started covering Bilderberg, I guess about 10 years ago, nine years ago.
[07:00.280 --> 07:03.640]  And at first he was making jokes about it and then when he got there he quit making
[07:03.640 --> 07:08.520]  jokes real quick and it totally politically changed his outlook.
[07:08.520 --> 07:11.000]  And now he's a serious journalist.
[07:11.000 --> 07:15.880]  He was a humor columnist for the Guardian.
[07:15.880 --> 07:19.720]  And then now he doesn't think things are funny.
[07:19.720 --> 07:24.440]  After he's been arrested and harassed and spied on and everything else that he's gone
[07:24.440 --> 07:29.720]  through you see one cannot be told about the matrix.
[07:29.720 --> 07:32.240]  One has to see it for themselves.
[07:32.240 --> 07:38.120]  You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I'll show you how deep the hole goes.
[07:38.120 --> 07:45.080]  You take the blue pill, you go back to Fantasyland.
[07:45.080 --> 07:52.240]  All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[07:52.240 --> 07:54.640]  And we see everything interconnected.
[07:54.640 --> 07:59.600]  Look at these headlines, Breitbart, and there's video of it.
[07:59.600 --> 08:06.440]  Paul Ryan's Pelosi Ask Obama Trade Moment.
[08:06.440 --> 08:08.040]  And here's the quote.
[08:08.040 --> 08:10.280]  Talk about Orwellian.
[08:10.280 --> 08:17.080]  It's declassified and made public once it's agreed to.
[08:17.080 --> 08:21.360]  And then he goes on, they have the quotes where he was saying it's not secret but now
[08:21.360 --> 08:23.160]  he's saying it's secret.
[08:23.160 --> 08:33.000]  Just like Senator Rubio getting up on the Senate floor and saying that there's no spying
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  period in America without warrants.
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.040]  I mean, that is an admitted lie, clapper-esque level fraud.
[08:41.040 --> 08:43.880]  When the head of the NSA got up and said, we don't spy on anybody.
[08:43.880 --> 08:44.880]  What is that?
[08:44.880 --> 08:45.880]  I've never heard of it.
[08:45.880 --> 08:48.600]  And then his lawyer came out and goes, he forgot.
[08:48.600 --> 08:57.200]  Yeah, he just heads the NSA building giant city size, you know, small town size complexes.
[08:57.200 --> 09:02.680]  Each building hundreds of thousands of square feet, in some cases 15 buildings, spying on
[09:02.680 --> 09:07.080]  everything on record, all the whistleblowers, all the documents, and he goes, what?
[09:07.080 --> 09:08.080]  Spying?
[09:08.080 --> 09:09.080]  What?
[09:09.080 --> 09:11.720]  I know nothing, nothing.
[09:11.720 --> 09:15.400]  It's ridiculous.
[09:15.400 --> 09:22.240]  But WikiLeaks has doled out another little doblet of part of a subsection.
[09:22.240 --> 09:24.520]  They have all 28 subsections.
[09:24.520 --> 09:25.760]  They said it was 33.
[09:25.760 --> 09:26.840]  Now it's 28.
[09:26.840 --> 09:29.560]  Now they released two full sections and part of another.
[09:29.560 --> 09:40.720]  And surprise, surprise, it makes Obamacare worse and it restricts all sorts of transactions.
[09:40.720 --> 09:41.960]  It's just horrible.
[09:41.960 --> 09:42.960]  Wow.
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.840]  Is that about climate taxes in it?
[09:46.840 --> 09:47.840]  Of course it does.
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.680]  I mean, we know what's in the EU, we know what's in the NAU, we know the agenda, it's always
[09:52.680 --> 09:53.680]  the same.
[09:53.680 --> 09:58.080]  And they won't let us see it like three times under Bush, the so-called immigration reform,
[09:58.080 --> 09:59.960]  but Senator Sessions would leak it each time.
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.920]  And then when we finally got Obama's new proposal, it was the exact same piece of legislation
[10:04.920 --> 10:06.560]  that they said was secret.
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.720]  Because they don't want you to see it because it's wildly unpopular, wildly unconstitutional.
[10:11.720 --> 10:19.720]  The only thing more wild is the 8% approval rating government in Gallup polls that continues
[10:19.720 --> 10:25.760]  to do this while amassing paramilitary force to try to illegitimately dominate a population
[10:25.760 --> 10:33.360]  that they have basically usurped.
[10:33.360 --> 10:34.360]  Here's another story.
[10:34.360 --> 10:40.440]  Revealed the secret immigration chapter in Obama's trade agreement.
[10:40.440 --> 10:46.880]  Revealed inside a huge tronch of secret of Obama trade documents released by WikiLeaks
[10:46.880 --> 10:53.640]  and key details on how technically a Republican voting for trade promotion authority, TPA,
[10:53.640 --> 10:57.400]  that would fast-track trade deals like the Trans-Soviet Partnership trade deal would
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.000]  technically also be voting to massively expand President Obama's executive authority when
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.840]  it comes to immigration matters.
[11:04.840 --> 11:06.240]  And it goes through the document.
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.400]  Of course, globalism gets rid of borders.
[11:10.400 --> 11:17.360]  Something we've seen out of TPP is a regurgitation of what we saw in 2007 when Judicial Watch,
[11:17.360 --> 11:24.400]  the founder of which is joining us today, Larry Klayman, sued and got 3,000-plus pages
[11:24.400 --> 11:25.400]  of the meeting.
[11:25.400 --> 11:31.960]  And let me tell you, I read, I scanned over most of it.
[11:31.960 --> 11:33.800]  I read hundreds of pages of the stinking thing.
[11:33.800 --> 11:37.400]  That's why I quote it constantly because I actually read it.
[11:37.400 --> 11:40.560]  Sometimes I just go to key subsections that other people have already read and go right
[11:40.560 --> 11:41.560]  to the points.
[11:41.560 --> 11:43.720]  I mean, there's just tens of thousands of pages of stuff a week to read.
[11:43.720 --> 11:44.720]  I can't read it all.
[11:44.720 --> 11:48.560]  But I spent time as I was making the in-game reading that.
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.120]  And talk about a skeleton key to open every door on this.
[11:52.120 --> 11:54.400]  It's how they run the whole show.
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.520]  The corporations come in, the Fortune 100, they vote in a Congress.
[11:58.520 --> 12:06.080]  Then the secretaries of states or the countries that are there actually just basically certify
[12:06.080 --> 12:08.720]  the whole thing.
[12:08.720 --> 12:11.720]  Take the orders, admit they're taking orders, and then vote.
[12:11.720 --> 12:19.640]  And then that vote certifying what they just said is seen as basically treaty law, outside
[12:19.640 --> 12:27.680]  of law, and then it's implemented by bureaucracies and agencies, even if it doesn't pass Congress.
[12:27.680 --> 12:30.760]  And that's their excuse whenever they ignore Congress, they go, we've already done deals
[12:30.760 --> 12:31.760]  with NATO.
[12:31.760 --> 12:32.760]  We've already done deals with the UN.
[12:32.760 --> 12:33.960]  We've already done this.
[12:33.960 --> 12:37.320]  We're going ahead with it, even if you don't ratify it.
[12:37.320 --> 12:41.440]  And Congress just wants to be able to not get the political heat, so they won't vote
[12:41.440 --> 12:46.480]  for carbon taxes or shutting down power plants or opening borders or putting our military
[12:46.480 --> 12:49.280]  under NATO or arming al-Qaeda.
[12:49.280 --> 12:52.880]  But they'll just kind of turn their head and watch it happen.
[12:52.880 --> 12:59.600]  But now they're transferring to the president incredible centralized control.
[12:59.600 --> 13:00.600]  Here it is.
[13:00.600 --> 13:09.040]  It releases more of Obama trade draft, altering healthcare, halting Medicare reform.
[13:09.040 --> 13:12.280]  Congress wouldn't be able to reform Medicare.
[13:12.280 --> 13:14.200]  It ends our country's sovereignty.
[13:14.200 --> 13:18.200]  It's one of the final world government documents.
[13:18.200 --> 13:25.360]  And Paul Ryan says you can't see it.
[13:25.360 --> 13:31.200]  Now we got Rupert Murdoch preparing to step down as CEO from 21st Century Fox, putting
[13:31.200 --> 13:32.200]  his son in.
[13:32.200 --> 13:33.200]  That's a big move.
[13:33.200 --> 13:34.440]  We've got huge Bilderberg news.
[13:34.440 --> 13:37.600]  Our reporters joining us.
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.840]  A bunch of special reports that are very important.
[13:42.840 --> 13:44.800]  New stingray systems that are even worse.
[13:44.800 --> 13:46.680]  And that's why I want to air this now.
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.200]  The minute I saw this report get filed last night, they were told by a quote informed local.
[13:52.200 --> 13:54.200]  They don't want to say by who.
[13:54.200 --> 13:57.920]  It was from someone who'd been inside the hotel high level.
[13:57.920 --> 13:59.520]  We're just going to leave it at that.
[13:59.520 --> 14:03.200]  There are always people that do care about freedom and whose conscience pushes them.
[14:03.200 --> 14:04.440]  I'm going to skip this network break.
[14:04.440 --> 14:05.440]  This is so important.
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.440]  Only break.
[14:06.440 --> 14:07.440]  I'm skipping.
[14:07.440 --> 14:10.360]  So station shouldn't leave us here in three minutes.
[14:10.360 --> 14:15.720]  This is a network break coming up.
[14:15.720 --> 14:22.400]  The minute I saw the truck, because I talked to Paul about it when I got the video yesterday,
[14:22.400 --> 14:24.480]  and it was near dark that they got up there.
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.800]  The only journalist so far to find a back road to get up and get actual video of the
[14:29.800 --> 14:30.800]  hotel.
[14:30.800 --> 14:31.800]  Notice all we have is photos.
[14:31.800 --> 14:32.800]  No one else has gotten video.
[14:32.800 --> 14:35.080]  Talk about something out of a science fiction movie.
[14:35.080 --> 14:37.360]  It looks like something from Geedy Prime.
[14:37.360 --> 14:45.160]  There's this big step pyramid Aztec style building.
[14:45.160 --> 14:54.800]  I expect they'll shoot Dustill Don too there, and the locals are really upset, and they
[14:54.800 --> 14:59.640]  go, no, we've been told directly by the federal police that this is to jam communications.
[14:59.640 --> 15:01.520]  Well, I looked at the truck.
[15:01.520 --> 15:06.040]  We're going to show it here in a moment and play the video of your radio listener, infowars.com
[15:06.040 --> 15:07.040]  forward slash show.
[15:07.040 --> 15:11.640]  We have the free video feed or drudgerport.com or infowars.com.
[15:11.640 --> 15:13.840]  Both have the article from infowars posted.
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.920]  You can go see the video in HD right there.
[15:17.920 --> 15:23.520]  But the minute I saw it, I said, guys, that doubles as basically a giant stingray.
[15:23.520 --> 15:24.680]  All the different arrays.
[15:24.680 --> 15:29.160]  Only one of the arrays is a jammer because I've talked to engineers in the past.
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.600]  I've been shown by folks, secret surveillance trucks that Dallas and Houston and Austin
[15:33.600 --> 15:39.800]  have that are basically like the size of a beer truck, and then the sides open up into
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.080]  a whole communications command center, these awnings come out.
[15:44.080 --> 15:52.720]  Well, the German systems got four masked on it, or the Austrian system, same group.
[15:52.720 --> 15:58.760]  And what it does is it basically makes everybody's cell phone data go through it first, and
[15:58.760 --> 16:03.320]  they've got two more of the trucks out there that have extended even bigger towers, but
[16:03.320 --> 16:04.960]  they're out past the tree lines.
[16:04.960 --> 16:09.280]  You can only see the towers, but I'll assure you those are mounted on trailers or trucks.
[16:09.280 --> 16:11.960]  Three of them we can see.
[16:11.960 --> 16:15.720]  One truck, but two masked that have been extended.
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.680]  And so it's their own internal communication system, because the federal government of
[16:19.680 --> 16:21.840]  Austria is putting this on.
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.280]  But it also grabs all the surrounding town's cell phone data and runs it through and spies
[16:26.280 --> 16:29.400]  on it for keyword right there at the site.
[16:29.400 --> 16:35.000]  So it's a giant stingray system to illegally harvest folks data.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.240]  That's what those trucks do.
[16:36.240 --> 16:42.640]  And they have a warrant, they go out and then follow the mafia around or whatever, or Russian
[16:42.640 --> 16:47.920]  smugglers or whatever, that's what Austrians deal with a lot, and then can track everything
[16:47.920 --> 16:48.920]  that's happening.
[16:48.920 --> 16:53.800]  No matter how many phones the criminal group is using, they've got a warrant to target
[16:53.800 --> 16:57.040]  that whole spectrum and to hone in on who it is.
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.680]  That's though how they've expanded this out so wide now that it includes everybody.
[17:01.680 --> 17:09.560]  So this is a big international story that NSA-style systems are being deployed to defend
[17:09.560 --> 17:12.920]  against the press and coverage of the secretive group.
[17:12.920 --> 17:18.640]  Just like TPP secret, this is secret because it's the very same group and they can't operate
[17:18.640 --> 17:20.680]  if their agenda continues to be in secret.
[17:20.680 --> 17:24.920]  And though I'm stating the obvious to our old listeners, but for new listeners, that's
[17:24.920 --> 17:26.960]  why Bilderberg is so important.
[17:26.960 --> 17:30.960]  First they said it didn't exist for decades, then they said it doesn't have any power.
[17:30.960 --> 17:35.880]  Now they admit it has power and they're trying to keep the public back miles away.
[17:35.880 --> 17:41.960]  But our reporters, who we're going to be talking to in about 10 minutes, 12 minutes to be precise,
[17:41.960 --> 17:48.640]  were able to get up to an area on the perimeter where they've put up a fence where they say
[17:48.640 --> 17:56.000]  you get two weeks in jail, 500 or 500 pound, 500 euro, excuse me, teleprompter free folks.
[17:56.000 --> 17:57.760]  So I go off memory.
[17:57.760 --> 18:01.440]  So fine.
[18:01.440 --> 18:04.080]  So great job to the crew getting this.
[18:04.080 --> 18:05.080]  So beautiful.
[18:05.080 --> 18:11.480]  I wish I was there looking at the HD video of the mist blowing over the pines and the
[18:11.480 --> 18:16.600]  fir trees and this bizarre pyramid building, it was like an alien spacecraft that's landed
[18:16.600 --> 18:17.600]  or something.
[18:17.600 --> 18:20.520]  And I mean, it just looks like a science fiction movie.
[18:20.520 --> 18:25.040]  And they're up there and it's just so gorgeous with the Alps in the background and then their
[18:25.040 --> 18:31.240]  surveillance imperial probe droid snorkels stuck up everywhere jamming because we talk
[18:31.240 --> 18:35.600]  to the locals, their cell phones, when you get right up the perimeter, don't work.
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.360]  We can't live stream from there.
[18:37.360 --> 18:39.280]  That's jammed.
[18:39.280 --> 18:43.160]  And when you start stepping because they've got it tuned to where as you start getting
[18:43.160 --> 18:46.320]  near the perimeter, cell phones stop working.
[18:46.320 --> 18:50.960]  And people that go to the hotel, I'll just leave it at that without giving away sources.
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.760]  Builderberg's probably really mad right now.
[18:55.760 --> 18:56.960]  Hey, not everybody's cowards.
[18:56.960 --> 18:57.960]  Okay.
[18:57.960 --> 19:01.760]  Not everybody's going to roll over to your takeover.
[19:01.760 --> 19:03.680]  And we know they are jamming.
[19:03.680 --> 19:04.680]  So the report's accurate.
[19:04.680 --> 19:07.560]  They are jamming.
[19:07.560 --> 19:11.100]  But the bigger issue is they're scooping all the data up.
[19:11.100 --> 19:18.000]  So let's go ahead and go to this report with our crew, Josh Owens, Rob Do and Paul Joseph
[19:18.000 --> 19:22.320]  Watson in Austria, Builderberg 2015.
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.160]  Rob Do here reporting for infoawards.com.
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.160]  We have some breaking news.
[19:26.160 --> 19:28.760]  First off, just over this way, we're going to show you some shots of this.
[19:28.760 --> 19:31.400]  We have a sighting of the Hotel Interalpen.
[19:31.400 --> 19:36.960]  We're able to see the site and it's along the road going to the golf course.
[19:36.960 --> 19:38.600]  But that's not the big breaking news.
[19:38.600 --> 19:40.600]  The big breaking news is actually standing behind me.
[19:40.600 --> 19:46.880]  And what it looks like we have here is a communications type van, but not to enable communications,
[19:46.880 --> 19:52.200]  and here with more on that is Paul Joseph Watson, who just landed from Innsbruck today.
[19:52.200 --> 19:53.200]  Paul, how are you doing?
[19:53.200 --> 19:54.200]  Good.
[19:54.200 --> 19:57.800]  Yeah, we were just talking to an informed local who told us a few other interesting things,
[19:57.800 --> 20:03.120]  but he directly said that this vehicle is basically designed to cut off communications
[20:03.120 --> 20:07.760]  for anybody in the nearby area trying to cover Builderberg as media.
[20:07.760 --> 20:10.880]  So this could be a transmitter, we're not sure, but we were told directly that this
[20:10.880 --> 20:15.920]  van is being used to cut cell phone signals so people can't broadcast and cover this
[20:15.920 --> 20:16.920]  event.
[20:16.920 --> 20:21.480]  So it's not enough that they have checkpoints six miles around the perimeter.
[20:21.480 --> 20:26.800]  Now we can't even cover the event via standard cell phone coverage because they're directly
[20:26.800 --> 20:28.720]  interfering in people's communications.
[20:28.720 --> 20:29.720]  It's ridiculous.
[20:29.720 --> 20:33.160]  And I'll tell you this, Paul, the Wi-Fi, we're supposed to have Wi-Fi at the place I'm
[20:33.160 --> 20:37.200]  staying at up on the mountain, and I haven't been able to get anything out of their only
[20:37.200 --> 20:39.160]  cell phone signals or the only thing that comes out.
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.120]  So I'm wondering if this has to do with that.
[20:41.120 --> 20:44.760]  There's also an antenna right over there, we'll shoot another long range shot of that
[20:44.760 --> 20:46.000]  so we can show you what that looks like.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.760]  It looks like it was pretty recent put up, but that could also be part of this triangulation
[20:50.760 --> 20:52.840]  grid that they're setting up to cut off communications.
[20:52.840 --> 20:57.520]  Yeah, there was speculation during the Bundy Ranch siege that this was happening, that
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.960]  they were cutting off communications.
[20:58.960 --> 21:00.280]  That was never confirmed.
[21:00.280 --> 21:05.600]  We were told directly by a very informed local who said that this is exactly what's happening.
[21:05.600 --> 21:10.440]  So if they have to go to this level to shut down independent media and mainstream press
[21:10.440 --> 21:15.040]  coverage of this event, again, it illustrates how paranoid they are about any information
[21:15.040 --> 21:17.880]  leaking out of Bilderberg 2015.
[21:17.880 --> 21:22.320]  And you know, I wouldn't be surprised if after we put out this report that suddenly this
[21:22.320 --> 21:26.880]  area becomes off limits, because right now we are free to travel in this area.
[21:26.880 --> 21:29.440]  You can actually see the barrier over here.
[21:29.440 --> 21:32.320]  You're not allowed to go over that way, and there's a barrier on the other side of the
[21:32.320 --> 21:33.760]  road over there.
[21:33.760 --> 21:37.440]  And those are basically, if you step over that line, or if you were caught on the other
[21:37.440 --> 21:42.280]  side of that line, it is a 500 euro fine, or two weeks in jail, whichever you prefer.
[21:42.280 --> 21:46.240]  Yeah, and it's obviously quite near the golf course, which is still open.
[21:46.240 --> 21:47.520]  That's outside the perimeter.
[21:47.520 --> 21:51.040]  But people could just wander into that security zone on a whim.
[21:51.040 --> 21:54.000]  You could get families out hiking on the weekend, not aware of what's going on with
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.560]  Bilderberg, and they could just wander in and be subject to a 500 euro fine.
[21:57.560 --> 21:58.560]  Again, it's insane.
[21:58.560 --> 22:02.240]  Or if you knock your golf ball over into the finery, and that's your last one, and
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.320]  hey, I could get my golf ball and boom, 500 euro fine, anything could happen.
[22:06.320 --> 22:08.400]  And guess what, Bilderberg is starting tomorrow.
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.400]  The elites will start landing at Innsbruck.
[22:10.400 --> 22:15.160]  They'll be taken here either by a car, they might come by helicopter.
[22:15.160 --> 22:16.680]  Who knows how they're going to be getting here.
[22:16.680 --> 22:19.560]  Henry Kissinger, I think, is coming by teleportation device.
[22:19.560 --> 22:22.400]  Well, I wouldn't put anything past 10.
[22:22.400 --> 22:26.840]  But I mean, this is a big story that, you know, we've been told that this van is there
[22:26.840 --> 22:28.360]  to cut out communications.
[22:28.360 --> 22:29.840]  There's nobody in it at the moment.
[22:29.840 --> 22:32.080]  I'm sure there has been at some point.
[22:32.080 --> 22:37.360]  So this is a major breaking story, Bilderberg directly interfering in communications to prevent
[22:37.360 --> 22:39.040]  coverage of their conference.
[22:39.040 --> 22:42.040]  Yeah, they're stifling all forms of communication.
[22:42.040 --> 22:45.240]  But what would you expect in the home of Adolf Hitler?
[22:45.240 --> 22:46.240]  I don't know.
[22:46.240 --> 22:49.320]  This is Rob Dew, reporting from Forrest.com with Paul Joseph Watson.
[22:49.320 --> 22:50.320]  Here's a shot.
[22:50.320 --> 22:53.480]  Once again, if anybody out there knows what this is, please tell us in the comments of
[22:53.480 --> 22:54.480]  this video.
[22:54.480 --> 22:58.720]  If we're wrong, but we've been told that this is a device, a communications device to cut
[22:58.720 --> 23:02.720]  off communication to the outside world exactly what the elites want.
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.440]  They want to stay in shadows.
[23:04.440 --> 23:08.000]  They don't want to step out in the light and just say, hey, we're here to control you.
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.040]  We're here to control all your money.
[23:10.040 --> 23:13.120]  We want to get rid of cash so we can control everything about your life.
[23:13.120 --> 23:14.920]  They want to keep that hidden from you out there.
[23:14.920 --> 23:17.120]  And that's why we need to see people out there speaking up.
[23:17.120 --> 23:20.800]  We thank everybody for calling the police and letting them know that they cannot stifle
[23:20.800 --> 23:22.160]  journalists here.
[23:22.160 --> 23:23.160]  That really helped us out.
[23:23.160 --> 23:24.160]  So we really do appreciate it.
[23:24.160 --> 23:27.480]  Once again, this is Rob Dew, reporting from Forrest.com and Paul Joseph Watson.
[23:27.480 --> 23:29.480]  Thank you.
[23:29.480 --> 23:35.240]  And we'll be talking to all those guys coming up here in about six, seven minutes after
[23:35.240 --> 23:37.480]  we got a break.
[23:37.480 --> 23:43.560]  But if you watch the video at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, you'll notice two other
[23:43.560 --> 23:45.400]  towers off in the distance.
[23:45.400 --> 23:51.920]  You can see the booms that they're telescopically hoisted on.
[23:51.920 --> 23:54.520]  And those are trucks or trailers that are out there guaranteed.
[23:54.520 --> 23:58.680]  We just can't see because the trees are blocking.
[23:58.680 --> 24:00.440]  And those are stingray systems.
[24:00.440 --> 24:06.280]  It may not be from the company Stingray, but popularly known, that's one of the most highly
[24:06.280 --> 24:08.880]  purchased by law enforcement units.
[24:08.880 --> 24:14.360]  Even some small towns, I was reading a few weeks ago, have purchased one town in California,
[24:14.360 --> 24:17.200]  purchased 50 of them.
[24:17.200 --> 24:21.520]  Another town in California, 40 of them, and they're expensive.
[24:21.520 --> 24:28.360]  So now they're just gonna have tons of police units without warrants, driving around, grabbing
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.760]  everybody's cell phone data and just listening to it.
[24:32.760 --> 24:35.120]  It's illegal for a PI to have it.
[24:35.120 --> 24:36.520]  It's illegal for a citizen to have it.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.520]  And I can see why.
[24:37.520 --> 24:41.440]  Of course, criminals, these have obviously fallen into the hands of criminals and hackers
[24:41.440 --> 24:44.440]  as well.
[24:44.440 --> 24:47.960]  And I get there's a bad criminal element out there and sure, I bet you can really catch
[24:47.960 --> 24:49.800]  a lot of criminals and stuff like this.
[24:49.800 --> 24:55.880]  But the government then becomes corrupt having this and ends up framing people, ends up consolidating
[24:55.880 --> 25:00.600]  power, every time things like this get turned against the people and the government itself.
[25:00.600 --> 25:04.640]  Look at how Congress is getting spied on by the CIA and the NSA.
[25:04.640 --> 25:06.320]  That's all come out.
[25:06.320 --> 25:08.400]  The British parliament's being spied on.
[25:08.400 --> 25:12.560]  The German Reichstag, the Bundestag is being spied on.
[25:12.560 --> 25:13.560]  It's come out.
[25:13.560 --> 25:17.920]  The bureaucracy and the private interest that get their people in control of it, that a
[25:17.920 --> 25:21.360]  corporate takeover of government.
[25:21.360 --> 25:22.440]  And it's mafia.
[25:22.440 --> 25:24.320]  It's not free market.
[25:24.320 --> 25:26.960]  And they want to meet in secret.
[25:26.960 --> 25:29.960]  It is a huge victory, though, that we're forcing it out in the open.
[25:29.960 --> 25:36.400]  I cannot reiterate that enough that we're forcing TPP out, that we're forcing Bilderberg
[25:36.400 --> 25:39.120]  out, that we're forcing these same players out.
[25:39.120 --> 25:43.320]  I mean, it's Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller at the bottom of all of this because they
[25:43.320 --> 25:49.920]  were handed the reins of power in the 50s by the retiring and dying Rockefellers and
[25:49.920 --> 25:51.440]  Rothschilds of that time.
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.760]  That's why everybody grovels to Kissinger and grovels to David Rockefeller.
[25:54.760 --> 25:59.080]  If you look up, the 30 plus organizations founded to push the UN, if you look at the
[25:59.080 --> 26:03.040]  organizations founded for the North American Union, every one of them was founded by the
[26:03.040 --> 26:04.920]  Carnegie's and Rockefellers.
[26:04.920 --> 26:09.960]  And David Rockefeller, you could go to C-SPAN speeches he's given 25 years ago, eight years
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.120]  ago, where he gets up there and talks about global government and all the organizations
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.120]  he founded.
[26:15.120 --> 26:20.440]  And I'm just a simple banker, but I'm proud to have founded this organization.
[26:20.440 --> 26:23.480]  And then you go, look, he's founded them all.
[26:23.480 --> 26:26.120]  His family gave him the land the UN's on.
[26:26.120 --> 26:33.640]  So all these billionaires grovel to him because almost the whole world, the system was chosen
[26:33.640 --> 26:37.640]  and designed by Henry Kissinger and David Rockefeller.
[26:37.640 --> 26:43.200]  It's almost 60 years, they've been running the Anglo-American power group.
[26:43.200 --> 26:45.480]  I mean, they're mega powerful.
[26:45.480 --> 27:00.960]  They're like Emperor Palpatine, folks.
[27:00.960 --> 27:07.360]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[27:07.360 --> 27:08.360]  the Info War.
[27:08.360 --> 27:17.360]  I was born in the soul of misery, and I never had me a name.
[27:17.360 --> 27:27.760]  They just give me a number when I was...
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.640]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[27:32.640 --> 27:41.200]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[27:41.200 --> 27:49.640]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[27:49.640 --> 27:57.120]  Bad luck when been blowing at my back.
[27:57.120 --> 28:02.440]  I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back.
[28:02.440 --> 28:03.440]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[28:03.440 --> 28:04.920]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[28:04.920 --> 28:09.560]  I was born in the soul of misery.
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.680]  Coming up, two very important reports.
[28:11.680 --> 28:18.200]  The delusions of King Barack Obama by John Bown and laser beams, bowings, weapons, get
[28:18.200 --> 28:20.160]  sci-fi sound effects.
[28:20.160 --> 28:22.640]  Leon McAdoo looks deeply into that.
[28:22.640 --> 28:28.840]  We have another police officer shot in the back, randomly, probably part of the war on
[28:28.840 --> 28:31.440]  local police, Soros is financing.
[28:31.440 --> 28:35.480]  It's out of the Houston Chronicle, we're going to be looking at that attempt.
[28:35.480 --> 28:41.000]  The officer is not dead, but is in the hospital, that's at least good news, because they want
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.720]  to kill a bunch of cops and get the cops all militarized, folks.
[28:43.720 --> 28:46.560]  It's the plan.
[28:46.560 --> 28:48.600]  People out there cheering, stuff like this are idiots.
[28:48.600 --> 28:53.240]  Once a civil war starts, it's not going to be a joke.
[28:53.240 --> 28:56.960]  Scientists in a major report say lack of good gut bacteria can be giving you cancer.
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.200]  We're going to look at that.
[29:00.200 --> 29:05.720]  We're going to look at Rupert Murdoch, preparing to step down as CEO of 21st Century Fox.
[29:05.720 --> 29:11.240]  Egyptian police arrest US Embassy worker on terror charges, yeah, the Obama administration
[29:11.240 --> 29:15.360]  is running Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood inside of Egypt.
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.960]  That's come out in an Egyptian court, we already knew that, but it's really crazy that our
[29:20.960 --> 29:27.200]  government would be funding the enemies of our allies to put horrible people in charge
[29:27.200 --> 29:33.800]  to destroy one of the most populous countries, the most populous country in the Middle East.
[29:33.800 --> 29:39.000]  You talk about a powder keg situation, this is dangerous.
[29:39.000 --> 29:46.000]  Coming up, Paul Ryan Pelosi ask moment, says it's declassified speaking of TPP, says it's
[29:46.000 --> 29:54.800]  declassified and made public, then they will release to the public.
[29:54.800 --> 29:58.960]  So there you go, it's declassified and made public when it's agreed to, so you can read
[29:58.960 --> 30:01.000]  it after we pass it.
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.200]  And we know what it gives Obama, dictatorial power over everything, and that's now coming
[30:05.200 --> 30:11.960]  out as WikiLeaks releases another piece of the puzzle.
[30:11.960 --> 30:18.920]  Now again, joining us from Austria is Paul Joseph Watson, Rob Do and Josh Owens, major
[30:18.920 --> 30:24.920]  new developments since we talked to them 21 hours ago here on the Wednesday, addition
[30:24.920 --> 30:34.800]  Bilderberg 2015, the very top, the paramount area of global power structure, the 150 members
[30:34.800 --> 30:42.880]  they say it's 130, it's usually 15, 20 extra secret attendees, fit on top all the major
[30:42.880 --> 30:47.920]  corporate boards, government boards, military boards and then have their minions under them
[30:47.920 --> 30:55.840]  carrying out money laundering, snuff films, weapons contracts, illegal deals, arms sales,
[30:55.840 --> 30:59.160]  the dictators, I mean you name it, they're involved.
[30:59.160 --> 31:02.720]  Just pick anybody they're involved at the top of Bilderberg and they're just involved
[31:02.720 --> 31:07.280]  in every nastiness, whether it's Hillary Clinton or Henry Kissinger or David Rockefeller,
[31:07.280 --> 31:08.280]  it only gets worse.
[31:08.280 --> 31:12.920]  And again, these are the people that went to the scientific technological elite that
[31:12.920 --> 31:21.840]  Eisenhower warned of in 1961 and his farewell address as Kennedy was coming in and decided
[31:21.840 --> 31:28.240]  to go with this eugenics plan, the computers, the checkpoints, the cell phones, the control
[31:28.240 --> 31:36.720]  grids, they've all, Brzezinski in 1976 wrote a book breaking it all down, the Technotronic
[31:36.720 --> 31:37.720]  Era.
[31:37.720 --> 31:42.960]  I remember being like 9 years old and my dad said when you get old enough son you need
[31:42.960 --> 31:47.280]  to read this and I was like what's the book about, he goes well the government brings
[31:47.280 --> 31:51.320]  in the drugs so they can control organized crime and the government launders the money
[31:51.320 --> 31:54.440]  and they're going to put in computers that control everything and track everyone, it's
[31:54.440 --> 31:59.480]  going to be just like Brave New World and then later when I was about, I don't know,
[31:59.480 --> 32:05.520]  11 or 12, I read the Brzezinski book, didn't understand much of it but it seemed wild.
[32:05.520 --> 32:11.880]  Do you understand, I mean he wrote books that they put Khmer Rouge in to kill a third of
[32:11.880 --> 32:17.720]  the Cambodian population, they write books bragging about their evil, that's who's at
[32:17.720 --> 32:23.480]  this meeting and they set all this up, I mean they are smart, they are powerful, there's
[32:23.480 --> 32:29.280]  a reason people worth $100 billion go to Bilderberg and grovel to them, Bill Gates has gone all
[32:29.280 --> 32:34.080]  of them because these guys built our world.
[32:34.080 --> 32:38.440]  I mean they are the ones that are turning our world into a nightmare, that's why they
[32:38.440 --> 32:45.120]  are important, every major U.N. property given to them by these people, all the corporate
[32:45.120 --> 32:52.200]  boards set up by these people since at least the late 50's, David Rockefeller, Zabigny
[32:52.200 --> 32:57.600]  Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger along with George Solz and a few others have run the
[32:57.600 --> 33:07.320]  entire country and thus the western world and they have set it all up and they don't
[33:07.320 --> 33:11.120]  want you to know about it, they don't want you to discuss it as they prepare to merge
[33:11.120 --> 33:15.320]  the three global unions into one super state under ten sub regions.
[33:15.320 --> 33:22.080]  Where did I read that, I remember being in Sunday school and I talked about the ten regions,
[33:22.080 --> 33:29.600]  the ten kings, I just, either it's all true and happening in prophecy or the globalists
[33:29.600 --> 33:36.040]  are following it as a blueprint, either way it's real, just like you could say with science
[33:36.040 --> 33:40.560]  fiction written a hundred years ago by Jules Verne's was he psychic or was he just a good
[33:40.560 --> 33:48.240]  guesser, doesn't matter what we envision ends up then manifesting, give it enough time.
[33:48.240 --> 33:56.640]  We take you now live to Austria in the Alps, outside of Telf, Paul Joseph Watson, give
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.560]  us your current location and what's happened in the last 21 hours.
[34:01.560 --> 34:06.040]  Yeah, we're currently back at the hotel Alex uploading some videos, we've actually
[34:06.040 --> 34:13.720]  gone on an interview with Charlie Ski, it was also a big story last night, he was basically
[34:13.720 --> 34:20.920]  raided at midnight by the cops in his hotel for the reason of simply going to retrieve
[34:20.920 --> 34:22.600]  something from his car.
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.680]  They searched his vehicle again, they had flashlights out in his face, they entered his
[34:26.680 --> 34:30.960]  hotel again, checked his pay, so there's a headline, London Guardian reporter raided
[34:30.960 --> 34:35.400]  in hotel room, get it up right now, bombshell information, the video, the video's already
[34:35.400 --> 34:40.240]  up, so the article's going to be up as soon as I get off the air here, but yeah, again,
[34:40.240 --> 34:44.520]  we've been generally more friendly to what it does, but we think that's obviously because
[34:44.520 --> 34:50.640]  you know, Rob and Josh got in their faces with the camera, and we had people on the
[34:50.640 --> 34:51.640]  world column.
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.640]  Yeah, you put all the numbers up, so they've generally been friendlier to what it does,
[34:56.640 --> 35:03.000]  but there was a protestor arrested earlier today, they had an armored personnel carrier,
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.640]  and again, just think how pathetic this is.
[35:10.640 --> 35:16.120]  Yeah, we've lost his Skype, right at the end, no, no.
[35:16.120 --> 35:19.520]  Stop for a moment, Paul, we're going to try to reconnect with you, or should you guys go
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.160]  back up to the roof, because I know we're interviewing Skelton in 20 minutes, perhaps
[35:23.160 --> 35:24.800]  is Skelton with you?
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.960]  No, Skelton's in a different hotel.
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.840]  So is he joining us by phone, guys?
[35:32.840 --> 35:37.120]  Let's try to get you now to be able to start over, maybe your Skype's stabilized.
[35:37.120 --> 35:40.720]  Go back to the beginning, and I'm going to try to shut up and let you report, Charlie
[35:40.720 --> 35:48.320]  Skelton raided at his hotel, London Guardian Reporter raided, nighttime raid, Bilderberg
[35:48.320 --> 35:53.400]  Police raid Guardian Reporter, I mean this is just insane at his hotel, and then go
[35:53.400 --> 35:57.160]  back over what's happened.
[35:57.160 --> 36:03.800]  Yeah, it was basically midnight to 1 a.m., he went out to retrieve something from his
[36:03.800 --> 36:10.080]  vehicle, the police immediately descended upon him, entered his lodge, started questioning
[36:10.080 --> 36:13.960]  all the people who were in there, demanded their papers, again, searched the vehicle,
[36:13.960 --> 36:19.320]  they had flashlights out, you know, shining them in their face, no, from what Skelton
[36:19.320 --> 36:23.160]  said, they were basically there for at least 20 minutes, maybe half an hour, he actually
[36:23.160 --> 36:29.480]  jumped in the shower because they were there so long.
[36:29.480 --> 36:33.440]  So we just got the video up on that today, shortly after I get off the air, so again
[36:33.440 --> 36:37.200]  another example of the harassment, and then after that I was saying they had an armoured
[36:37.200 --> 36:43.240]  personnel carrier driving up the road towards the Interalpen Hotel to deal with what was
[36:43.240 --> 36:49.840]  literally less than 10 bloggers and journalists at the entrance to the hotel, there were about
[36:49.840 --> 36:55.280]  three protesters at the checkpoint at the bottom of the hill, from what I saw from
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.400]  the images, because we were as close to the hotel as we could get, because they give us
[36:59.400 --> 37:04.280]  that permission because we're staying in the lodge nearby, but at the bottom checkpoint,
[37:04.280 --> 37:10.800]  the first checkpoint, I saw no more than three or four protesters, one of those was arrested,
[37:10.800 --> 37:16.640]  so again that's testament to the fact they've got 2,000 police out here to deal with probably
[37:16.640 --> 37:24.200]  a total of two dozen journalists, bloggers and protesters, 2,000 police.
[37:24.200 --> 37:30.960]  Well you know what proverb says, the wicked flea when none pursue, that's Proverbs 28
[37:30.960 --> 37:38.840]  1, obviously the police aren't idiots, obviously the Bilderberg group are not idiots, why are
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.000]  they doing this when it villainizes them, is it just because they're so disconnected
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.960]  and so arrogant they don't care, Paul?
[37:44.960 --> 37:50.160]  I don't know whether they're acting on direct orders from Bilderberg, they obviously were
[37:50.160 --> 37:55.360]  in relation to what was going on right at the entrance to the hotel, because there was
[37:55.360 --> 38:01.120]  a security screw up, not the first one, when one of the Bilderberg members arrived in a
[38:01.120 --> 38:06.080]  car and they couldn't confirm his papers or whatever, so he was literally sat there in
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.560]  the car, we were like two yards away, he was sat there for about 10, 15 minutes, then another
[38:11.560 --> 38:16.680]  Bilderberg member arrived behind him and they couldn't confirm his credentials, so that's
[38:16.680 --> 38:21.400]  not the first security screw up that they've had and we were basically right up against
[38:21.400 --> 38:26.120]  the car, but you can see absolutely nothing, even with the polarizing lens in because these
[38:26.120 --> 38:31.040]  blacked out windows are so intense, we did capture some individuals, sent them out on
[38:31.040 --> 38:38.200]  Twitter but again they're very difficult to identify, but we did get as close as physically
[38:38.200 --> 38:43.760]  possible at the only entrance to the hotel right as they were driving in, we were literally
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.000]  two yards away from all the cars and all those photos are on Twitter.
[38:47.000 --> 38:53.960]  And we're showing some of those Twitter's tweet photos right now at infowars.com and
[38:53.960 --> 38:59.480]  prisonplanet.com and directly from real Alex Jones on Twitter and also your Twitter account,
[38:59.480 --> 39:05.480]  Paul Joseph Watson, but that was my next question, you just got to it, a lot of them have started
[39:05.480 --> 39:12.800]  to arrive, we see photos of the bright green armored personnel carrier, that is a military
[39:12.800 --> 39:21.040]  type, that is a heavy armored vehicle, simply insane, I see Charlie Skelton out there surrounded
[39:21.040 --> 39:28.160]  by the police vans and the police watching and the armored vehicle, just simply ridiculous.
[39:28.160 --> 39:34.720]  No, there were bus loads of police going up and down all day, they were just sending more
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.680]  and more buses of police when literally nobody had turned up, I mean to compare it to Switzerland,
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.880]  there were at least 50 to 75 protesters who weren't just bloggers and journalists.
[39:46.880 --> 39:52.720]  Now right next to the hotel, it was a smattering, there were a few people from Italy, a few
[39:52.720 --> 39:58.160]  Americans there and us and that was basically it, it was less than 10 people at the peak
[39:58.160 --> 40:05.240]  time when all the Bilderberg members were arriving and Rob Dew was also able to hike up into
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.240]  the mountains and get some really good shots directly onto the Bilderberg hotel, really
[40:10.240 --> 40:12.240]  clear shots of the balconies.
[40:12.240 --> 40:16.240]  Well, you couldn't get the Bilderberg man, but you did get the female police and that
[40:16.240 --> 40:18.240]  you get a gold star for.
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.120]  There are a lot of female police around and in fact the one that they encountered in the
[40:23.120 --> 40:27.920]  police station was at the checkpoint today at the bottom, we saw her again.
[40:27.920 --> 40:35.000]  My goodness, it looks like the Swedish Katie team in dark blue uniforms, it's not bad on
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.000]  the eyes.
[40:36.000 --> 40:44.240]  Anyways, excuse me folks, I am a man, expanding on all this though, Paul, the police didn't
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.280]  get hysterical in England, they didn't get hysterical in the US, they didn't get hysterical
[40:48.280 --> 40:52.520]  in Turkey, they didn't get hysterical anywhere, they did a little bit in Greece, but what
[40:52.520 --> 40:53.520]  is up with the Austrians?
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.800]  I mean, they are really following the Germanic stereotype of flipping out, talking to Estal
[40:58.800 --> 41:06.200]  and others, he said Germany is even worse, just the hysteria of like 10 reporters and
[41:06.200 --> 41:11.440]  hundreds of police and armored vehicles, it's a joke, it'd be like armored vehicles showing
[41:11.440 --> 41:18.880]  up at a park where families are having picnics or something, I mean what is the issue here?
[41:18.880 --> 41:24.000]  I mean, they must realise how ridiculous it is seeing it today, and the other point is
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.520]  again, there are no mainstream journalists there whatsoever, there was one RT cameraman
[41:30.520 --> 41:35.160]  who was staying in the same hotel as us, who we talked to, and he compared it, he was talking
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.360]  about Botswana and all these other places where he'd been thrown in jail for filming,
[41:40.360 --> 41:55.040]  he said it was somewhat approaching that, but again, we've got him having a pause,
[41:55.040 --> 42:00.400]  he's going to have to reset, we're going to come back in the next break, finish up with
[42:00.400 --> 42:04.600]  him, then talk to the other reporters, then get Charlie Skelton on, but really important
[42:04.600 --> 42:08.840]  information coming across from Paul Joseph Watson, I think we should go ahead and call
[42:08.840 --> 42:13.520]  Rob Do on his cell phone, so when we come back he can be on video, but with the cell
[42:13.520 --> 42:18.760]  phone audio, or give Watson Do's cell phone or vice versa, let's do that, we're going
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.720]  to go to break and come back here in a moment and get some more of this intel, but looking
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.080]  at the Twitter photos that we're going to put into an article for infowars.com of the
[42:28.080 --> 42:38.800]  armored vehicle, armored vehicle joins Stingray snooping towers and jammers at Bilderberg,
[42:38.800 --> 42:45.480]  but the big headline is, London Guardian accredited reporter covering Bilderberg for nine years,
[42:45.480 --> 42:52.080]  no criminal record, media critic as well, well known, has TV shows in the UK, a part
[42:52.080 --> 42:57.560]  of TV shows, I mean the cops know who everybody is, they have dossiers, they know that Skelton's
[42:57.560 --> 43:05.920]  harmless, and they raided him last night at his hotel, and he came into it at 1 AM.
[43:05.920 --> 43:14.400]  This is pure intimidation and shameful, but again, what do you expect in Botswana or Somalia
[43:14.400 --> 43:24.320]  or Austria, and it is this love of authoritarianism that gave the world Adolf Hitler and hot
[43:24.320 --> 43:34.400]  blonde policewomen, but excuse me, but I'm just joking around folks, this is just ridiculous,
[43:34.400 --> 43:40.520]  I just want to believe in people, I want to think of the good in people, but man, government
[43:40.520 --> 43:44.440]  is just out of control and they're run by a bunch of crooks, but we do have the first
[43:44.440 --> 43:49.800]  video of the hotel, they've kept people back so far, our guys got it finally, that's up
[43:49.800 --> 43:56.080]  on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com right now, Paul Watson, he probably doesn't have more
[43:56.080 --> 43:58.960]  to add, let's just get doing here because I want to go ahead and get the Charlie Skelton
[43:58.960 --> 44:03.040]  article up first, I want to break that right now with Paul Watson's video, now I'm a
[44:03.040 --> 44:06.800]  sneaking suspicion this is going to go viral, where is the press though, will you stand
[44:06.800 --> 44:12.040]  up for each other and free speech worldwide or will you all aid the globalists in destroying
[44:12.040 --> 44:13.040]  freedom?
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.280]  Now before I go any further, briefly, I told you we were running out of survival shield
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.960]  X2, we ran out for a couple days, we had a limited amount that got finished, it is a
[44:21.960 --> 44:27.400]  very small amount compared to what we had last time, and group is working on then getting
[44:27.400 --> 44:31.560]  more of the deep earth crystals and manufacturing more, but that could take months, so if you
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.200]  want to get survival shield nasa and iodine X2, you've heard the right reviews, a lot
[44:35.200 --> 44:38.880]  of folks have deficiencies, if you're going to talk to your physician and take iodine,
[44:38.880 --> 44:44.840]  I would suggest this because it's so pure, it's what I take, infowarslife.com, it helps
[44:44.840 --> 44:59.880]  find the operation, you can't lose, bill de berg 2015, you'll never find a more wretched
[44:59.880 --> 45:14.080]  hive of scum and villainy, we must be cautious in austria
[45:14.080 --> 45:20.520]  And we are back live talking to rob do, paul watson and josh owens from their hotel outside
[45:20.520 --> 45:25.760]  bill de berg 2015, what the elite don't want you to see, they don't want you aware of
[45:25.760 --> 45:32.720]  this, they want you to know all about jenner and all about kardashian and all about lebron
[45:32.720 --> 45:37.520]  james and all this stuff that doesn't matter.
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.520]  We're in an epic battle against a scientific takeover that has decided to reduce world
[45:42.520 --> 45:49.760]  population by at least 90%, publicly they say 80, and you know what, you can look at
[45:49.760 --> 45:54.560]  their arguments and see how we're hurting the earth and seeing lazy people in overpopulated
[45:54.560 --> 46:02.240]  western countries in some areas that are overpopulated and argue yeah, we should reduce human population,
[46:02.240 --> 46:05.960]  but they're doing it through soft kill in the food and water, they're even targeting
[46:05.960 --> 46:11.360]  smart hard working people, you can't do that and not become evil, and it turns out they're
[46:11.360 --> 46:17.440]  the worst people for the earth with GMO, genetic engineering with all of it, so they're not
[46:17.440 --> 46:24.200]  even doing what they say they're doing, they're using that excuse to be totally machiavellian
[46:24.200 --> 46:30.880]  and kill whoever they want, and I'm not endorsing eugenics, I'm saying I see their perspective,
[46:30.880 --> 46:36.040]  I understand their perspective, I don't agree with it, but they don't even follow what they
[46:36.040 --> 46:41.880]  claim they're doing it for, they really just like to hurt people, and humans will be weak
[46:41.880 --> 46:48.800]  and decadent by themselves when it's encouraged and the skids are graced, we're in trouble,
[46:48.800 --> 46:53.400]  again it's very expensive for us to send our crew to Austria, we're able to do it because
[46:53.400 --> 46:59.600]  you do support infowars.com, we're running a 20% off special on ProPure G2 water pitchers,
[46:59.600 --> 47:05.320]  the best deal we've ever offered, we also are offering again the survival shield X2
[47:05.320 --> 47:09.600]  nation I-9 is back in, hopefully not for a limited time, but it looks like it'll be
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.600]  this last little run for a while, that truck is coming in to the fulfillment center today,
[47:14.600 --> 47:20.640]  in fact it's arriving any minute from the laboratory, so infowarslife.com, when it's
[47:20.640 --> 47:28.400]  sold out it's sold out, books, videos, t-shirts, it's all available there at the infowarstore.com
[47:28.400 --> 47:33.240]  shopping center and that's how we fund this operation, so thank you all for your support,
[47:33.240 --> 47:38.600]  but if you want your survival shield nation I-9 X2, you want to stockpile it or hold some
[47:38.600 --> 47:42.120]  back or share it with friends and family, now's the time to act, we're also about to
[47:42.120 --> 47:45.680]  sell out of Prostagard, it'll take a month or two to refill, and we're also about to
[47:45.680 --> 47:49.840]  sell out of oil of oregano or organic type, alright shifting gears, only a few minutes
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.960]  in this segment, Rob do give us your take on what you've seen the last 21 hours, things
[47:54.960 --> 48:01.160]  have escalated, armored vehicles, 1am raids of London Guardian reporter, this is getting
[48:01.160 --> 48:06.840]  crazy, yeah it definitely is, and right now actually outside our window, I've got Josh
[48:06.840 --> 48:12.000]  on standby with a camera, we saw, I saw two helicopters zip by real quickly, there's a
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.920]  big rainstorm coming in, we can see lightning over the mountains right now, and then another
[48:16.920 --> 48:20.720]  helicopter followed, I got the third helicopter, so there's a lot of helicopter activity right
[48:20.720 --> 48:25.360]  now outside which is in contrast to what we saw, we didn't see any helicopter activity
[48:25.360 --> 48:35.400]  all day, well they deliver a lot of people by helicopter, totally, and so today when
[48:35.400 --> 48:39.120]  we were at the entrance, I was talking to a German who spoke really good English and
[48:39.120 --> 48:42.680]  he said, you know earlier today I was up on the mountain, I saw a great vantage point,
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.920]  I said let's go, you know we already had the other guys there getting video, and we hiked
[48:47.920 --> 48:52.800]  up this mountain trail, beautiful hike, and we get about halfway up the mountain and there's
[48:52.800 --> 48:58.080]  just this amazing shot of the hotel, so I tweeted those out, sent them to the guys,
[48:58.080 --> 49:01.040]  hopefully I think they're turning them into backgrounds for you right now as well, we're
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.560]  trying to get this stuff out there as quick as we can, and on top of that this morning,
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.840]  early this morning we went to the golf course where the most likely the Bilderbergers will
[49:10.840 --> 49:15.800]  be there on Saturday from the intel we've received, and so we wanted to go scope out the place,
[49:15.800 --> 49:22.240]  we got probably within 150 yards of the actual hotel, that is the closest spot you can get
[49:22.240 --> 49:26.440]  but stay there, I want to talk about these surveillance trucks, stay there, there's a
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.840]  delay in audio folks, so that's why we're talking over each other, this is GCN Communications
[49:32.840 --> 49:47.640]  Radio Network, big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers, well
[49:47.640 --> 49:56.440]  so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin, Texas,
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.360]  Alex Jones, if you're a radio listener you're missing dramatic photos and video that are
[50:01.360 --> 50:08.400]  playing behind me of up close at the giant hotel, the armored limousines coming in, helicopters,
[50:08.400 --> 50:16.800]  you name it, it looks like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's real, these
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.760]  meetings shrouded in secret, merging what was left to the Nazi elite with the Anglo-American
[50:21.760 --> 50:28.000]  Empire at the end of World War II, the meetings began in 1945 but didn't officially kick off
[50:28.000 --> 50:33.920]  until 1954 in Usterbeck, Holland when the group was given the name the Bilderberg Group, Henry
[50:33.920 --> 50:39.560]  Kissinger and David Rockefeller, both attended the 1954 meeting with the father of Queen
[50:39.560 --> 50:44.400]  Beatrice of the Netherlands, Prince Bernhardt, the SS officer, and they're back in their
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.880]  home, Austria, beautiful country, amazing culture, really great people except they love
[50:49.880 --> 50:56.640]  black uniforms and tyranny for some reason, some of them do, that's just kind of the flavor,
[50:56.640 --> 51:02.800]  they think Darth Vader is cool, I'm sure, I guess Vader is a Germanic name for father,
[51:02.800 --> 51:08.280]  but let's just continue here now with Rob Do, Rob Do, please continue.
[51:08.280 --> 51:14.840]  Okay, while we were there we got some up close shots of the other antenna arrays, not the
[51:14.840 --> 51:21.400]  actual truck but the other one that was up closer and we also found a map, they had maps
[51:21.400 --> 51:26.160]  in the police lines strung up everywhere where the actual line is set now where if you go
[51:26.160 --> 51:31.120]  over this line, you're done, you're getting a $500 fine two weeks in jail and then we
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.280]  went back and went up back to the entrance of the hotel, shot some footage there, interviewed
[51:35.280 --> 51:39.040]  Charlie Skelton, I actually just put up an interview I did with an Italian parliament
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.480]  representative, his name was Apollo Burini, I think that is the right way to pronounce
[51:43.480 --> 51:47.560]  his name, he was actually up there, he's concerned, Mary O'Bonty is coming to this
[51:47.560 --> 51:53.840]  Bilderberg this year and also the Lilly Gruber, a news executive and anchor who's sort of
[51:53.840 --> 51:58.320]  like, she does a lot of political interviews, so of course they're inviting her up so she
[51:58.320 --> 52:03.440]  could help dish out the agenda in a nice, soft, tempering way that that Trendy's will
[52:03.440 --> 52:04.440]  agree with.
[52:04.440 --> 52:08.480]  They're also there so that other reporters can dream someday if they keep their mouth
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.600]  shut too, they might get invited as well and get to like worship Henry Kissinger.
[52:13.600 --> 52:17.840]  And rubbish speed or something, totally disgusting.
[52:17.840 --> 52:23.640]  And yeah, so we have two different vantage points in which we could perform some reconnaissance
[52:23.640 --> 52:28.360]  tomorrow during the event, hopefully we'll get some of them out on their balconies because
[52:28.360 --> 52:33.360]  we got, I know exactly where to go, it's about an hour hike from the bottom but we can get
[52:33.360 --> 52:38.680]  up there and I was told even that there is a radar station up higher up the mountain
[52:38.680 --> 52:43.560]  near, there's a cabin up the mountain that this guy goes up there and he sells beer to
[52:43.560 --> 52:48.200]  hikers and there's a radar station nearby and this guy's really pissed off about it.
[52:48.200 --> 52:51.640]  So now we know why you want to hike to the top, it's not to get video.
[52:51.640 --> 52:55.280]  Oh, of course, no, I mean I can bring my own beer with me.
[52:55.280 --> 52:56.280]  I'm joking.
[52:56.280 --> 52:59.880]  Everybody's just, everybody's just talking about this guy that he sells beer on top of
[52:59.880 --> 53:04.760]  the mountain so it sounds like a real hermit type person who is pissed off about the Bilderbergers.
[53:04.760 --> 53:09.000]  So I'd like to find an old person that's pissed off because I have yet to find an old person
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.360]  that's really pissed off about this.
[53:10.360 --> 53:12.880]  The only people I've found are young people that are concerned about this.
[53:12.880 --> 53:17.480]  The old people I've given up, they've submitted, okay, it's like that sculpture we shot a couple
[53:17.480 --> 53:22.160]  days ago of the globalist, giant globalist stepping on the peon.
[53:22.160 --> 53:25.040]  I mean, these people have just submitted and it makes me sick.
[53:25.040 --> 53:30.040]  So to find an old person that's really fed up about it, I can't wait to meet it.
[53:30.040 --> 53:32.160]  What kind of beer is he selling?
[53:32.160 --> 53:33.160]  I don't know.
[53:33.160 --> 53:34.160]  I'll find out tomorrow.
[53:34.160 --> 53:35.720]  I'll definitely tweet a picture out.
[53:35.720 --> 53:36.720]  And that's the problem.
[53:36.720 --> 53:40.640]  We can't, when we're on location, we can't send out a lot of tweets.
[53:40.640 --> 53:44.640]  My cell phone's not working, Josh's isn't working, Paul seems to be working but it might
[53:44.640 --> 53:46.920]  be because he's on a European plan.
[53:46.920 --> 53:51.360]  He can get tweets out but I mean, we're really having a hard time getting stuff out actually
[53:51.360 --> 53:52.680]  to come back to our hotel.
[53:52.680 --> 53:56.880]  So they admittedly, they admittedly have jamming equipment, I mean that is jamming equipment
[53:56.880 --> 54:00.160]  but it's also really stingray to grab all the cell phone data.
[54:00.160 --> 54:04.360]  It sounds like they're jamming you right now, Alex, I didn't make that out.
[54:04.360 --> 54:07.080]  I was just saying that that's also a stingray type system.
[54:07.080 --> 54:08.080]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[54:08.080 --> 54:13.080]  I'm gonna get Charlie Skelton on, if at the bottom of the hour Paul Watson, you or Josh
[54:13.080 --> 54:17.840]  want to add more, please come back but I want you to coordinate with the writers and folks
[54:17.840 --> 54:23.640]  right now, Steve Watson, Don Salazar, Kit Daniels and others to get all your photos and
[54:23.640 --> 54:29.960]  videos out to the world as we engage in real journalism because the corporate or media
[54:29.960 --> 54:30.960]  won't do their job.
[54:30.960 --> 54:36.880]  Now, London Guardian is doing their job so their guy got raided.
[54:36.880 --> 54:53.680]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[54:53.680 --> 54:59.920]  Infowars.com is barely up right now, we're getting massive traffic, we normally get
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.160]  over a million individual visitors a day, we're getting a million every few hours right
[55:05.160 --> 55:10.360]  now and the site's very interactive, we have free video feeds and more.
[55:10.360 --> 55:15.040]  Bilderberg deploys Giant Stingray to grab all digital communications, Surveillance Truck
[55:15.040 --> 55:19.160]  parked outside Bilderberg is a Giant Stingray type system.
[55:19.160 --> 55:24.920]  I would just add type system on steroids and you can see in the videos, we'll get some
[55:24.920 --> 55:32.880]  screen grabs of that as well, that there are other towers that have been put up from trucks
[55:32.880 --> 55:37.720]  or trailers, we just can't see because trees are in the way, we can see even bigger mast
[55:37.720 --> 55:42.240]  and we talked to locals that let's just say have access to the hotel, they say none of
[55:42.240 --> 55:45.440]  their cell phones work, it is a jammer.
[55:45.440 --> 55:52.960]  So very serious situation, violating all sorts of EU laws to have these systems because
[55:52.960 --> 55:58.920]  I've seen the EU laws and the UK laws as well that are similar, we have laws here as well
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.920]  on the illegal stingrays and when I say stingray it's like saying taser, people think of all
[56:04.920 --> 56:11.880]  electrical devices for defense or whatever as a taser, though there's dozens of companies,
[56:11.880 --> 56:18.760]  we don't know exactly what companies, machinery's involved, it's just commonly known as a stingray
[56:18.760 --> 56:21.640]  type device.
[56:21.640 --> 56:26.120]  Now we've had our reporters harassed at their hotel, the police have come there, they've
[56:26.120 --> 56:30.120]  stopped them, searched them at the checkpoints, knowing them by name, we then put out the
[56:30.120 --> 56:36.360]  police department, state police department's name and they call it state police, it's federal
[56:36.360 --> 56:41.320]  police but they're sub district over that state.
[56:41.320 --> 56:46.200]  In Austria, you called, they backed off, stopped harassing them but Charlie Skelton, award
[56:46.200 --> 56:54.560]  winning journalist for the London Guardian, wrote this story yesterday at the G7, we journalists
[56:54.560 --> 57:01.440]  were pampered at Bilderberg, were harassed by police and last night they got raided,
[57:01.440 --> 57:08.640]  they came into their lodge, hotel room, rousted everyone, this is unprecedented, they know
[57:08.640 --> 57:13.600]  exactly who Skelton is, they escorted him off the mountain top when he first arrived
[57:13.600 --> 57:19.200]  two days ago with a police escort in front and back of his car, even though he had a
[57:19.200 --> 57:26.320]  reservation up the mountain, he got back up to his reservation, again vguardian.com, Charlie
[57:26.320 --> 57:34.480]  Skelton joins us to talk about this situation, we now have a bright green armored vehicle
[57:34.480 --> 57:42.280]  showing up to menace, ten journalists, we have just squadrons of police stomping around
[57:42.280 --> 57:47.840]  and getting in everyone's face, Charlie has been detained in other countries, he's been
[57:47.840 --> 57:52.600]  stalked, harassed, like the late great Jim Tucker has been, they tend to really target
[57:52.600 --> 57:58.240]  Skelton because the Guardian is undoubtedly the number one paper in the UK and from talking
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.720]  to family that lives in Germany and talking to folks that go to Europe, a lot have been
[58:02.720 --> 58:08.880]  to Europe but not that much, the Guardian is the English speaking paper and people all
[58:08.880 --> 58:13.760]  speak English in Europe or try to communicate and so it's kind of the international language,
[58:13.760 --> 58:17.800]  so it's the biggest paper probably in Europe itself and so this is like them going after
[58:17.800 --> 58:24.840]  a New York Times reporter in New York City, it's very bold, it's very aggressive, it's
[58:24.840 --> 58:32.440]  very dangerous because if they can go after Charlie Skelton folks, they can go after anybody
[58:32.440 --> 58:36.800]  and so we either hang together or hang separate, he's a mild-mannered fellow as well, he's
[58:36.800 --> 58:42.720]  a comedy writer, journalist and actor from Suffolk, England, an Oxford University graduate,
[58:42.720 --> 58:46.800]  he started as a journalist writing features for the evening standard and the Guardian,
[58:46.800 --> 58:51.200]  he began reporting on the Bilderberg group many years ago and at first kind of thought
[58:51.200 --> 58:56.040]  it was a joke, very soon didn't think it was and so he joins us now, he works with his
[58:56.040 --> 59:00.960]  wife as well, getting out some of the hardest reporting out there, so thank you so much
[59:00.960 --> 59:02.200]  for coming on, sir.
[59:02.200 --> 59:05.680]  Thank you, can I just compliment you on your amazing-looking studio?
[59:05.680 --> 59:11.520]  Well, thank you, you know, so the Guardian coverage has gone to the front of the paper
[59:11.520 --> 59:16.480]  website, it's in the physical paper, this has got to really upset the Bilderberg group,
[59:16.480 --> 59:20.400]  tell us what happened to you and why you think they're so bold.
[59:20.400 --> 59:27.480]  Well, I think it's possibly because the juxtaposition of the G7 and Bilderberg this year has meant
[59:27.480 --> 59:32.720]  that the policing here is on an extremely heavy scale, I mean, there's a lot of it,
[59:32.720 --> 59:40.280]  it feels to me as heavy as it was back in 2009 in Greece and it's not as bad as that,
[59:40.280 --> 59:44.560]  but there's still a big police presence and yeah, I think it has something to do with
[59:44.560 --> 59:49.960]  the giant, gigantic security operation that was the G7.
[59:49.960 --> 59:54.600]  And for folks that don't know, the G7 just ended and this is basically a continuation
[59:54.600 --> 59:55.600]  of that.
[59:55.600 --> 01:00:00.440]  Yeah, it was only, it finished like a couple of days before and about 20 miles away just
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:05.160]  across the border in Germany, but you know, the experience of being a journalist in the
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:12.880]  two places could not be more extreme, I mean, there we were pampered and primped and helped
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:19.880]  out in every way imaginable by the government and here, you know, we're impeded and hindered
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.320]  and harassed by the government and it's very strange to have gone one from the other, it's
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:31.120]  like getting out of a hot bath and jumping into an ice bath, you know, it's quite a shock.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:35.560]  Why do you think it's so different, A, and then B, I mean, I know you got the classic
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.000]  British gentlemanly demeanor when stuff happens to Watson, everyone wants to talk about it,
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.520]  you got raided last night, so let's, let's, I mean, let's talk about what happened to
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.520]  you.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:51.480]  Well, it, I had ended up with three policemen in my hotel room and but they were checking
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.840]  a, checking my identification.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.480]  Now this bear in mind, my identification had been checked twice at two separate police
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.960]  checkpoints about 15 minutes before, no more than that.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.920]  So I was an extremely checked and identified person at this point, but it wasn't good enough.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:13.120]  So these three policemen and they, you know, fluorescent bibs and their sidearms decided
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.960]  to stand over me for, it must have been about a quarter of an hour.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.120]  This is at one in the morning, right, in my hotel room.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:23.280]  I got so bored and I was so annoyed, I wanted to say something but I didn't want to be aggressive.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.960]  So I just took my trousers and shirt off and stripped down my pants and said, I'm taking
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.120]  a shower and went and got into the shower, had a shower, came out in my towel and they
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.040]  were still in my room, still checking me out, possibly checking me out in my towel, I don't
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.040]  know.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.560]  But so I, they said, no, I'm sorry, Mr. Scott, you've got to put your clothes on and come
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.560]  to your car.
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:47.840]  So I put my clothes on and the interview continued out at the car where they, they searched the
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840]  car.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.320]  I don't know quite what they were expecting me to have put in the car somewhere after
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:53.320]  the.
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.880]  And I know full well you're writing cover stories for the biggest newspaper in Europe and they're
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.880]  acting like this.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:02.600]  Well, I did say to them, look, I mean, I know this is annoying for me, but at least you're
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]  giving me something to write about.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:08.560]  So I mean, I, and also I was out there for so long that I decided to just start talking
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:12.120]  to them about, about Bilderberg and I just said, look, I know you're treating me like
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.720]  a criminal right now, but there are actual criminals up in the hotel.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.560]  You happen to be pointing the wrong way, you guys, you know, there, there are convicted
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:28.520]  felons up in, in the Bilderberg, Kissinger, Petraeus, the list goes on and on.
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:34.840]  Yeah, and there's a, there's an Austrian guy as well, who's just been handed out a René
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:35.840]  Benco.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:42.280]  He's just been handed out a one year suspended sentence for bribery, you know, so there's
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:45.520]  they knew him and they said they were aware of that and they started looking a bit embarrassed
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]  at that point.
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.280]  And then I just started talking about HSBC, there's a lot of HSBC there this year and
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:55.280]  they've literally just a few days ago had to pay 28 million pounds to the Swiss banking
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.760]  authorities for money laundering.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.120]  And that's just right over the mountains in Switzerland.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]  That's going on.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120]  Yeah.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.520]  And in fact, if you look at the list of participants, you'll see that there's a member of the very
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:12.280]  senior banking, Swiss banking official from Geneva is, is also one of the attendees.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.920]  So we've got the people basically over the regulations of banking.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.520]  They're meeting with the HSBC people.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.200]  I mean, this is, this isn't a conflict of interest.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.200]  Yeah.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.200]  Not just that.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:27.520]  There's these chief legal officers there, as well as the group chairman and the British
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:33.080]  for the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who's over banking.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:40.480]  So it couldn't be a more sort of sick little cluster going on for three days in private,
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.680]  in absolute private.
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.280]  This is not your granddaddy, smoky room as a reporter to Cary Jackson put it.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.800]  I mean, this is, this looks like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:57.000]  If folks have seen Dune, the movie with the spaceships on the landing field, the hotel
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.840]  looks like some bizarre science fiction spaceship that's landed and it's there in the middle
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840]  of the Alps.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.840]  It's just a bizarre scene.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:10.400]  But it doesn't look like it's about to sort of retract its wheels and take off into the
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]  skies.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:16.520]  But yeah, it's a strange place and this, you know, when you think about the amount of money
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:22.960]  being spent by the state on policing this and on essentially stopping reporting happening.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:28.400]  And things like the, there's a, I know you reported on one radar master, I know there's
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.520]  also a military radar station, which we found out about a couple of months ago, just, just
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.440]  again down from the hotel.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.880]  So there's a lot of military here.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:40.520]  There's a lot of, there's a lot of state police, but then all of this money they're putting
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.520]  into it.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:47.080]  All of that money, they can't find a line in their budget for a press center and some
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:50.800]  proper accreditation, like the G7 does, you know.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.000]  Well, and what about England?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.680]  I mean, the police were so nice.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.120]  We had 3,500 people there.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.280]  You helped put on the whole event.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.760]  It was a huge success.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.760]  We exposed it.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.320]  The media said, yeah, it's a criminal lobbying group.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.280]  I mean, what's the difference between the UK police who aren't perfect by any stretch
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:09.200]  of imagination compared to the Austrian police?
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.760]  Well, clearly the decision had been made in, in the UK and I think also in Denmark the year
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:21.400]  after to, to liaise with the press and with protesters and to enable their actions.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:28.240]  So in both cases of Copenhagen and Watford, we were, we were given a hand by, you know,
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:33.560]  I'm not being an apologist for, for, for when the police do bad things, of course, but in
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:39.720]  those two instances, it did seem like the police were working to help us both cover
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.720]  the conferences.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.560]  Well, I had the police tell me, I had the state, federal and locals all tell me they
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.800]  don't like Bilderberg.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800]  Absolutely.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:55.560]  I mean, I remember hearing that in, in citrus in 2010, the head of the police, some people
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.480]  were arrested up crawling through the bushes, taken to the head of the police and he just
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.240]  went, yeah, look, I'm with you guys.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:05.600]  So I mean, you get a lot of sympathy from people, but you know, the Bavarian police
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.320]  on seeming to be the most sympathetic at the moment.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320]  Yeah.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.240]  No, it's the famous, it's the famous cliche and it's cliche because it's true.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:18.080]  Certain percentage of the Germanic folks love authority and all they know is it's the big
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.400]  evil hotel with the big wigs there and they're going to grovel to it.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.400]  We'll be back.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.400]  Stay there.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.240]  I want to learn what you think's on the agenda that we haven't learned yet, who may be on
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:31.960]  the list and not on the list, Charlie Skelton from the Guardian, rated at 1 a.m. drug out
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.240]  in his underwear and he's calmly taking it.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:45.440]  All right, Charlie Skelton, final segment with him, he's on a deadline to get out his
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.280]  latest report, Charlie, you know, they come into your place, they take you back out of
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.280]  the car.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.200]  I mean, this is really outrageous in a Western country.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.880]  It's what I expect to hear from a third world nation.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.200]  I mean, I know you don't like to draw attention to yourself, but I think journalists should
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.200]  rally to your aid and others' aid because we've really seen an attack on journalists
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.800]  the last few years across the Western world that's unprecedented.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:17.960]  Yeah, I mean, I think that the way to do it, I think, is to try and push, in this instance,
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:23.120]  to push for press accreditation and for a press center and to build relationships because
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:26.800]  the more you can build relationships, the less exposed you feel.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.240]  And I guess that's also what applies to relationships between journalists.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:37.120]  But you know, this precious little journalism going on in the mainstream media, when you
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.560]  look at what went on in the G7, where there was this kind of prepackaged stuff being fed
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:48.040]  out from the government, all this pulled footage and photos being kind of regurgitated and
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:54.480]  chewed over, and it didn't strike me that that was particularly real journalism.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:58.640]  Whereas, you know, seeing your guys out there and climbing up a mountain and taking photos
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.560]  of radar masts and that kind of thing, that's actually, you know, it's not easy to do.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.400]  And I think, I don't think journalism should be that easy.
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.400]  That's a good point.
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.560]  Modern so-called journalists just sit there, get a government or corporate press release,
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.800]  republish it and put their name on it.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800]  It's all press releases.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:18.400]  And the whole of the G7 was a huge press release.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.640]  And it was to be incited and to be in that, within the press center, this giant thing
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.160]  held in an ice skating center, it was very surreal at times, and it was surreal because
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.320]  everyone was taking it seriously.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.520]  It was like they were looking at photos of a pantomime, and Goldilocks was up on the
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:37.240]  screen and they were all going, oh my God, Goldilocks looks like he's in trouble.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.440]  You know, it was like that kind of seriousness of the whole thing.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.440]  And that's what was...
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.120]  It was like cognitive dissonance, I felt.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.680]  Sure, what do you make of the armored vehicle rolling up to you and nine other journalists
[01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.200]  like you were terrorists?
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:50.800]  Well, it's kind of bizarre.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.360]  I mean, it's part, I suppose, of the general militarization of police.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:58.160]  I suppose there's so much of this equipment that's just finding its way and trickling
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.080]  back into the domestic police forces, which is a bit grim.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.040]  And I guess in America, you have a lot more of that.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.200]  Every town has one store and a tank.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.400]  But it's kind of weird.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.400]  I mean, it's just such overkill.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:13.400]  I mean, it's so unnecessary.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:18.280]  In fact, the policing and the checkpoints are so heavy that there's precious little
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.440]  few people out here, you know, sang even by the gates.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:28.280]  It's very small, you know, and I have seen one mainstream journalist, which is good,
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.280]  but unfortunately she was in a Mercedes being driven up to the hotel.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:34.720]  She's the editor of a Norwegian newspaper.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.120]  So yeah, I guess I've seen one mainstream journalist.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120]  So that's good.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.120]  That's a start.
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.240]  I didn't promise not to talk in closing.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.320]  We know some of their agenda.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.280]  What do you think this year's Bilderberg's really all about?
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.680]  And how would you summarize other key points as a journalist that you're witnessing?
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:59.960]  Well, from the agenda, obviously, the AI leaps out and with Google DeepMind and the general
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.520]  shift of Bilderberg towards high tech and towards those fears, you know, with the people
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:09.600]  like Peter Thiel from Facebook and Alex Karp from Palantir and Schmidt from Google, etc.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:10.600]  and Mundi from Microsoft.
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.200]  These are big players in the tech field and it's very interesting to see their presence
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.360]  and their power is growing within Bilderberg.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:17.360]  So that's interesting.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.360]  And I guess also Greece is a big thing and you've got a member of the executive board
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.400]  of the European Central Bank, you've got two European finance ministers, three European
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.400]  prime ministers.
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.800]  They're going to be talking about Greece and the Grexit, and they're going to be talking
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.640]  about it with all these creditors, like people like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank and Morgan
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.520]  Stanley and Lazard and HSBC, etc., etc., the list goes on.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.680]  But, you know, not a single Greek-serving politician will be there.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:47.960]  So, you know, if I was the, you know, the finance minister, Yanis of Greece, I'd be
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.600]  wanting to come here now.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.640]  It can't make them happy that the UK wants to get a vote on staying in the EU, something
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.920]  that never got to be put in the EU before.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.520]  I notice they've got some of the media people there as well that are big on keeping the
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.520]  UK in the EU.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.400]  I notice some of those folks got invited into Bilderberg and we know that it ties into
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.400]  TPP as well.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:10.400]  Absolutely.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400]  Well, everything does.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  At the moment, yeah, everything ties into the big trade agreements, and there's some
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.560]  key lobbyists for that here at Bilderberg, you know, at the very top level.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:26.320]  And you could almost describe the whole meeting as a lobbying opportunity for these trade groups.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.480]  Why do you think they're targeting you so much?
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.560]  Because my reporters said it days ago when you first got there that they were seeming
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.240]  to be targeting you, and I don't think there's any doubt of that now.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.440]  Well, I'm just flattered to get any kind of attention.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.160]  I suppose once a year I get, you know, I get shipped to my underwear and chat to a policeman
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.360]  and it's nice.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.640]  And I should point out, by the way, that I stripped, that wasn't stripped.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640]  I was...
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640]  No, I understand.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.240]  But you're in your place and then they take you back outside.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.800]  I was being a bit sarcastic there.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:56.800]  What are you going to do next?
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.640]  Or maybe you can't say.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]  Next now.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.640]  Yes.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.040]  I just carry on trying to report.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]  But you know, it's all you can do.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:11.640]  All you can do is turn up and do your best to report on events.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.840]  I mean, it's very simple.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:19.000]  We're talking to a rare man, a real journalist who works for a major media outlet, Charlie
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.600]  Skelton from The Guardian.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.760]  We'll cover your action here every day.
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.760]  Thank you.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.760]  We're on the march.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]  Mark Dice coming up.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:43.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.480]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:54.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:01.280]  I went out walking through streets paved with gold.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:10.280]  Lifted some stones, saw the skin and bones of a city without a soul.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:22.280]  I went out walking under an atomic sky where the ground won't turn and the rain it burns
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.280]  like the tears when I said goodbye.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:34.280]  Yeah, I went with nothing, nothing but the thought of you.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:43.280]  I went wondering.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:56.280]  I went drifting through the capitals of Tim where men can't walk or freely talk and sons
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.280]  turn their fathers in.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:07.280]  I stopped outside a church house where the citizens like to sit.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:15.280]  They say they walk the kingdom, but they don't walk God in it.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:18.280]  I went out riding.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.280]  Johnny Cash bringing us in.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:24.280]  Bilderberg deploys Giant Stingray to grab all digital communications.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  That story is up on infowars.com.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.280]  It's also jamming communications.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:35.280]  We also have a link up there, the Mark Dice video.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280]  It's also on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:49.280]  We'll put that article on screen.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:59.280]  Obama Zombies, American Sign Prankster Petition to Nuke Russia Video.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.280]  Doesn't that just say everything?
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.280]  And he's done more than 100 of these videos, I would guess, where he comes up and says
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.280]  I want to put all Godowners for Obama in forced labor camps.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.280]  They go, yeah, I'm sick of these people.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.280]  We want to put all Republicans in death camps.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.280]  Yes, we want to burn the Jews for Obama.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280]  I mean, you could say anything.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.280]  For Obama, they say yes.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.280]  Well, now Nuke Russia for Obama.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.280]  This is political correctness.
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.280]  Just mindless idiots who have no intellectual acumen, who have nothing.
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.280]  They just are good, and everybody else is racist, and everybody else is bad.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:40.280]  In fact, I never even played the clip of Jerry Seinfeld doing an interview,
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.280]  and his daughter's like 13, and they said, hey, you want to move back into New York City
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.280]  so you can meet more boys?
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.280]  And their daughter said, that's sexist.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.280]  Girls liking boys is bad.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.280]  And they said, you're joking, right?
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]  And she said, no.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.280]  You see, men and women together is bad.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.280]  All men are rapists.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.280]  This is the mind control.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:09.280]  You could say banned men for Obama, and I guess women would sign it.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280]  We've gone out in Austin.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.280]  You know, hey, let's kill babies up to age five.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.280]  Sure, it was for Obama.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:21.280]  As long as it's for Obama, how do you like your doubling, tripling health care cost
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.280]  that was supposed to be free?
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280]  It's the mind control.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.280]  Mark Dice joins us.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.280]  He has a new book out.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.280]  He's written a bunch of books.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.280]  They're excellent.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.280]  And the new book breaks down the Bilderberg group.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.280]  We'll talk about that with him some in a moment.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.280]  We can put that up on screen as well.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.280]  The Bilderberg group, facts and fiction.
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.280]  So we can get his take on Bilderberg group as well today.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.280]  But Mark Dice, media analyst, joins us.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.280]  Mark, we're going to play this video here in a moment.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.280]  But I tell you, I've been out there to California.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280]  I've seen it myself.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.280]  I've seen it at UT and other trendy areas.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.280]  This is a cult of idiots.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:02.280]  Paul Watson, an article last week titled The Rise of the Idiots.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:08.280]  In the West, the IQ points are down 14% in just the last 20 years.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  We are not just dumb from not being trained and not being educated, but we are dumb because
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.280]  of the environment we're in, whatever's causing it, the fluoride, the rest of it.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:26.280]  And this is The Rise of the Fascistic Idiots who can hardly talk but can say,
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:31.280]  I love Obama, Obama, Obama.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.280]  Hey, you know, I don't want to open our borders up and pay for it.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]  Shut up, racist.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:38.280]  I don't want to have my health care written by foreign insurance companies with death
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.280]  panels.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.280]  Shut up, racist.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.280]  All they know is racist, racist, racist, polygater, racist, polygater sexist, racist, racist.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.280]  I'm an electoral.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.280]  I'm an electoral.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.280]  Racist, racist, racist, racist.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.280]  I love Satan.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.280]  I love babies.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.280]  I love Mao.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.280]  Racist, racist.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.280]  I mean, and I'm not joking.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.280]  I can play clips of feminists running around screaming, I love Satan.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.280]  I love killing babies with their tongues hanging out, hell Satan.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:04.280]  I mean, this is, perhaps they don't have souls and this is some interdimensional demonic
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.280]  infestation.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.280]  I mean, I'm joking, but maybe I'm not.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:13.280]  Mark Dice, what do you have to say?
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.280]  I think we're having some Skype problems.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.280]  I got audio now.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280]  Okay, good.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.280]  I'm ready to all this.
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.400]  I mean, how dumb are they going to get?
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.400]  It's amazing.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.480]  I mean, I didn't hear the intro there, but as you saw, the audience maybe knows this
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:32.760]  video outraged Russians because we're kind of used to this kind of political comedy, I
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.760]  guess, but it's a tragedy.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:38.360]  And so I've been getting emails from a lot of major Russian newspapers and television
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.640]  networks, not just RT.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:42.600]  I'm talking about Russian major mainstream media.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.280]  They're absolutely outraged and stunned.
[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:51.120]  I don't think obviously the humor probably didn't transfer over, but to see the fact that
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.640]  an American citizen or a whole bunch of them would be willing to launch a nuclear strike
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:01.360]  at this day and age, decades after the Cold War has ended, is absolutely stunning and
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.080]  has appalled them.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.960]  We are in the idiocracy.
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.600]  It can't get much worse.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.440]  These are like three-year-old children that I just order them around and they obey and
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.760]  they don't think they obey Obama.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:19.520]  It's absolutely incredible, especially this far into the Obama presidency when he has
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.520]  failed at everything.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.360]  He's backtracked on just about every promise.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  He's expanded the Orwellian.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.360]  Mark, I'm going to stop you.
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.840]  I'm going to stop you and then give you the floor, but you just said something incredible.
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.440]  They accidentally had you potted down.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.680]  You couldn't hear my three-minute, four-minute rant intro about your book and how these are
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.920]  zombies and how dumb they are and how they're not even really liberals, how they're just
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:44.720]  in this cult of just using magic words and what Jerry Seinfeld said about political correctness.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.920]  And then you come on and say exactly what I was saying without even hearing me because
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:49.920]  it's veritas.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.920]  It's truth.
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.480]  These people are a dangerous cult of sick, sick freaks.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:55.480]  I'm sorry.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.480]  Go ahead.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.080]  You can see sometimes I didn't even get to finish to mention that it was about nuking.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:02.480]  I just said, hey, will you help Obama?
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.320]  And they were just more than willing to help.
[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.720]  These are people who probably were too lazy to get up and drive through the polls and
[01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.440]  go and vote or send in an absentee ballot.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:14.280]  But if you just put a petition in front of them and give them a pen and they just feel
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:18.480]  hey, all I need to do is sign to help Obama, and you can see in these last few videos I've
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:25.720]  added an Obama shirt just to add to the overall theme of supporting Obama.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.720]  It's incredible, man.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:31.600]  I mean, obviously not everybody signed the petition, but the fact that anybody would
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.880]  sign this and not pick up and in some of these instances, I mean, I'm repeating myself three
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:38.000]  different times as they're signing it.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.400]  This is to nuke Russia.
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:42.840]  This is to launch a preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:48.640]  Maybe they think a nuclear strike means that it's like a worker striking.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.520]  They're not going to go and work.
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.640]  Maybe society's gotten so dumbed down, Alex, that maybe some of these people, I'm thinking,
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:21:01.720]  hopefully, they think that a nuclear strike is opposing a nuclear attack.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.720]  It's astounding.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.800]  And I understand why the Russians are so upset.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.000]  I just saw a video this morning, a Russian journalist attempted to do the same thing
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  over in Russia asking his people to sign a petition to nuke Americans, and it was something
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.320]  only like two out of 30 people signed the petition.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:23.440]  I never thought I would be starting a potential international incident, but this is what's
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.880]  happening in America, particularly Southern California, which may be an extra special
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:28.880]  brand of stupid.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:32.280]  But, of course, they're smarter than us because they're liberal.
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.440]  It doesn't matter if we're real classical liberals, paleoconservatives, whatever you
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:37.280]  want to call us.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:42.000]  They can just wave a wand and feel better just calling us racist or sexist or whatever.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.520]  But a lot of times I talk to you, I talk to my reporters, usually about nine out of 10
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:52.800]  will say, turn in all our guns for Obama, about seven out of 10 say put conservatives
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.040]  in forced labor camps, and then they speak perfect English and they'll go, oh, don't
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.040]  tell me about it, buddy.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040]  I'm sick of these people.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.040]  Let's put them in a camp.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:05.440]  You know, you have that famous video, but when you look at this, it's just so flabbergasting
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:09.680]  what a cult they're in because beyond just being stupid, they want to submit to that
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:10.920]  gang.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:15.040]  But what percentage of people, how many did you talk to, how many said, yes, let's nuke
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.040]  Russia?
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:20.440]  You know, a lot of people just simply don't want to pay any attention to somebody bothering
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.840]  them on the beach with a petition.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.960]  So a lot of people just keep walking and they don't even pay any attention to what I'm
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.960]  saying.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.960]  They just say, no, thank you.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.960]  And they keep on walking.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.600]  But out of the people who stop, I mean, the vast majority of them will sign it.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.000]  It's astounding.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.520]  When I started this petition series a few years ago, I never thought people would be
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.520]  signing.
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:44.000]  I thought the comedy bit would be me pretending to be in this Obama loving zealot and to evoke
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.880]  such an incredible reaction from the people about this character's, you know, insane
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:54.560]  devotion to these insane policies that he wanted to support.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.520]  And it was the exact opposite.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:03.200]  And so there's probably 40, 50 different petition videos man on the streets repealing
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.680]  the bill of rights.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.680]  It's just incredible.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.600]  I mean, some of these videos take 10 minutes, 15 minutes to shoot in the majority of that
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:14.200]  time is me standing there waiting for somebody to come by because I usually will target,
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.280]  you know, somebody that's by themselves, if there's a group of people, somebody's going
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.440]  to have a light bulb go off in their head.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.920]  The odds are if it's a family of three, four or five people, somebody might have a light
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.320]  bulb go off in their head and get it.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:28.720]  So I'll usually just target one person that's walking by themselves.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:34.200]  And just, just, and I do use the power of suggestion to demonstrate what it is that
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.040]  the president does to demonstrate how the mainstream media is able to just repeat a
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.600]  lie over and over a few times and people just start to believe it through the power of suggestion.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.720]  And I'm just a guy in a t-shirt.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.440]  I don't have a badge.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:51.160]  I don't have a suit, just from telling them before they start to think, some of them might
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.320]  not have done it, might have had a light bulb go off in their head.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:57.080]  But I derail their thinking, you can see by just repeating myself.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:58.920]  Yeah, but it's not just that.
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.880]  I mean, some of your critics say that and ensure some of them, I mean, you're using
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:06.000]  sales tactics, but you very calm, you repeat it three times.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.960]  If you look at some of the liberals, I mean, these look like professors and people that
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.120]  are well-spoken and they're like, yeah, we've got to put the Republicans in forced labor
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.320]  camps and take their guns.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.320]  I've had enough of them.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.400]  The guy's like, I hear you, man, you don't have to tell me, I'm sick of these people.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:21.640]  I mean, a lot of them know what they're doing when you're saying, let's put the Jews back
[01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.800]  in ovens and for Obama.
[01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:25.680]  I mean, they know what they're signing.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.960]  They just can't say no because you put the word Obama in front of it.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:33.400]  You're simply illustrating that that's the cult they're in.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.320]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:42.120]  One of the petition videos was to ban any display, public display, t-shirts, bumper
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.160]  stickers, et cetera, of any religious symbols, which would be a clear violation of the First
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.000]  Amendment and these liberals couldn't wait to sign up.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.360]  I mean, there's no, there's no power of suggestion.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:56.560]  They just, they wanted to ban Christian symbols, bumper stickers and t-shirts and they couldn't
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.720]  wait to sign up fast enough for that.
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.120]  And then, you know, I did a petition to repeal the Bill of Rights and then I did a follow-up
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.200]  just to interview people, just to try to get the reactions.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.400]  I would just tell them, hey, Obama wants to repeal the Bill of Rights, you know, just
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.960]  to move us forward in the New World Order.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:11.960]  You on board with that?
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.040]  I mean, just the key word is, will you do this for Obama?
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:20.840]  And they're so liberal now that they will and want to violate the basic freedoms that
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:23.120]  we've established in this country to support their...
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:24.120]  Sure.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.280]  I want to play your powerful report that's on drudgerport.com, infowars.com, you name
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.760]  it, and all over Russian news, all over some U.S. news now, beyond jaywalking.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.520]  I mean, these are the real people and I'm not insulting so-called liberals.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:41.400]  You go to so-called liberal areas, they are the dumbest, most suggestible people on the
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.400]  planet.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.160]  I know Republicans get pretty bad as well when they think their guy's in power, so it's
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:56.480]  kind of a mob psychology, but you call them zombies, Ted Cruz calls them the fascist left.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.320]  I just call them a cult of dumbasses.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:02.360]  I mean, I don't know what you call these people, but it's scary to know, this is who's
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:08.280]  taking over America, I want to play your report, here it is, folks.
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.160]  We just need a couple more signatures.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:17.600]  This one's to support President Obama's new plan to deal with Russia, and they're violating
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:25.880]  the UN sanctions, so we're going to launch a preemptive nuclear strike, a birthday to
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:32.920]  support the nuclear strike against Russia, and a signature, really appreciate that.
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:40.120]  This is the one way we can maintain our superiority here, thank you so much.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:47.000]  President Obama has decided to implement some new sanctions in order to prevent some trade
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:55.120]  imbalances, Prince birthday, and a signature, and part of those, part of the plan to deal
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:01.480]  with Russia is to launch a preemptive nuclear strike, which will help to maintain America's
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:05.120]  superiority in the world.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.480]  Appreciate your supporting a nuclear attack on Russia.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.480]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:16.520]  Okay, here, just real quick, we're just getting signatures, you've seen that Russia has been
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:22.520]  threatening the United States lately and trying to flex their international muscle, violating
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:23.520]  all sorts of trees.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.760]  If they launch nuclear weapons at us, we're going to blow them to smithereens.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:33.840]  This is to support Obama's plan for a preemptive nuclear strike to Russia, just to send them
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:39.800]  a message that we are still the world's first and only superpower.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:46.760]  Just print here a birthday and a signature, just to support America real quick.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:49.440]  I have lived in America all my life.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:57.960]  You're an American, we need to get behind the political power, print, birth date and
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:02.120]  a signature to support the preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:05.720]  Point me, this is the only thing I really signed for them.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:14.920]  Birth date to support the nuclear strike against Russia and the patriotic thing to do these
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:22.280]  days signature, to send Russia a message with a preemptive nuclear strike.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.280]  Thank you for supporting that.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:25.520]  That's why he doesn't disappoint me.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:31.840]  President's plan to launch the preemptive nuclear demonstration against Russia for violating
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.840]  the...
[01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.840]  No thanks man.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:37.160]  We're just trying to show support for, we need a hundred thousand signatures to support
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.720]  Obama's plan.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.360]  You could tell that last guy was a vet, he looked at you like you were crazy.
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.080]  And that's the problem, so many people have not been in the military, they just have no
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:46.800]  idea we're talking about the end of the world here.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.040]  You ought to go out and ask him to support the end of the world for Obama and blowing
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.960]  the planet up to stop racism, the planet is just too racist and God tried to destroy
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.040]  it with water, Obama will do it with fire this time, let's just blow the planet up
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.040]  for Obama.
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.800]  I mean that'll take care of the Ku Klux Klan, we'll kill all of them by blowing the earth
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:05.800]  up.
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.440]  I mean you're right though, this is how they can get up on TV and say there's no drone
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:15.960]  program or ObamaCare doesn't have death panels or the TPP's public but you can't read it.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:21.000]  As Paul Ryan just said, I mean it's not just the Democrats doing this, they're deploying
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.640]  the biggest lies I've ever seen Mark Dice.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.560]  And you can see that last guy was happy about it, he didn't want Obama to disappoint him
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:34.880]  by not nuking Russia and apparently these people, their brains have degenerated so far
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:39.100]  that they just can't even understand what the consequences would be, they're operating
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:45.520]  off of such a primitive, really a subhuman intellectual level back to the primitive
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.680]  us versus them tribalism.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.480]  They want to battle Russia, they want America to be number one, you can hear me using the
[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.480]  buzz words like this is patriotism.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:58.720]  I think you're number one by killing 180 million people.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:04.360]  This is what happens in an entertainment wasteland, we have an entire generation or two now that
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:09.560]  have just been raised on television, the more brutal, the more vicious the entertainment,
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.400]  the more entertained they are, the more they love it.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:17.520]  So detached from news, the only information they get is through their Instagram and through
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:20.280]  their Twitter accounts and most of the-
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.360]  Let's just say it, they're gone, they're not people.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.000]  They're subhuman zombies.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.360]  By design, I mean they're gone, this is what the establishment manufacturers now is, jelly
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:31.360]  fish heads.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:40.480]  We'll be back, Mark Dice.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.240]  Mark Dice is with us five minutes to the next hour, then Larry Klamman with big breaking
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:51.320]  news is going to be joining us from Judicial Watch.
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.000]  There may be a microphone open in that control room, guys.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.320]  But before we go any further, I just want to remind everyone that we're supported by
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:03.520]  viewers and listeners like you, thank you so much for your support, please support local

[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:34.960]  markdice.com. Mark, tell us a little bit about your new book that I haven't read yet, I've
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.120]  read some of your others on the Bilderberg group.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.400]  Continuing with my facts and fiction series, now the latest book, The Bilderberg Group
[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:50.760]  Facts and Fiction and it chronicles the Bilderberg group's history, their discovery, their slow
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:56.200]  exposure particularly the last few years thanks to social media, thanks to people like yourself
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:01.160]  largely and Drudge Report now for the fifth year in a row which has been covering it.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:05.000]  So if you're new to this or even if you've been familiar with it, you can pick up some
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.040]  serious pieces of the puzzle, a lot of people don't know that the Bilderberg group, I mean
[01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:12.440]  they have a checking account, they have to have a checking account so they have a business
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:17.400]  entity, it's called American Friends of Bilderberg here in America and they operate as a tax
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:22.280]  exempt charity foundation which means that some of their financial records have to be
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.440]  made public so I've been able to get them, it shows that they're spending about a million
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:32.840]  dollars a year on the conferences, it shows who the donors are, it's quite a fascinating
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:38.360]  look into the history of the Bilderberg group and as many of your viewers know, it's been
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:45.400]  confirmed a conspiracy fact now and it's incredible how such an important group of people, Jim
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:51.720]  Tucker has that famous quote about if 120 sports players were to meet it would be a big news
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:56.120]  but 120 of the world's most powerful men meet in a hotel that's shut down and surrounded
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:02.040]  by armed guards and now private security, privacy fences as well, it's just not news.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:05.560]  So you can't say this isn't news worthy, you can't say that it's not interesting,
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:11.240]  it's certainly more powerful than the G8, the G20 or Davos, any of these major world economic
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:16.280]  forms but the fact that there's not a mention in or hasn't been at least for primarily the most,
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:21.800]  you know, last 60 years coverage or even a mention in the mainstream media is quite obvious that
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:27.720]  there has been a plan, call it a conspiracy, an agreement between the Bilderberg group and all
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.640]  American major mainstream media to leave them out of the news. Sure, these are the puppet
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:39.080]  masters they don't want us looking at, folks can find your book at Amazon.com, MarkDais.com,
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.080]  we should carry it at m4store.com, we've carried a lot of your great work in the past, we're gonna
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:48.200]  go to break, come back in 70 seconds and get more into the Bilderberg group and how they control
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:57.080]  the media and have helped turn the Westerners into such dumb idiots. This is an American
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:01.800]  president, just add puppet, then vote and repeat every four years.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:19.320]  Third hour straight ahead, info wars. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:34.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:43.880]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:50.920]  The article's on infowars.com and instantly went up on drugsreport.com, but this is what the Brits
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:57.000]  do. Watson's British shows Charlie Skelton in The Guardian, they water down the sensational stuff,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:03.240]  they showed up, they were in his hotel room 25 minutes at 1 a.m., then they made him come outside
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:09.560]  and then, you know, we're doing all this to him, shining lights in his face.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:14.680]  It was like a 45-minute interrogation. You read the article, Guardian journalist gets
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:19.960]  midnight raid by Bilderberg police. It was like a scene from Stalock 17, the security lockdown
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:24.360]  surrounding the 2015 Bilderberg group conference, reached a new intensity last night when London
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:30.040]  Guardian journalist Charlie Skelton received a midnight visit. Now, it was a raid from police
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:36.920]  who entered his hotel room, not just his hotel, demanded to see his papers after they'd already
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:43.560]  seen them 30 minutes before and took him outside, doesn't say that, and inspected his vehicle while
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:48.120]  shining a search light in his face and then it goes over to him. Add to this armored vehicles
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:53.400]  roving around. We need to add that to the article. I know Paul wrote it fast, did a great job,
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:57.560]  but this is a big deal. We need to add the photo of the armored vehicle for journalists,
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:02.120]  all of it. What do you think they're freaking out so bad about or is this Bilderberg more
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:05.080]  important than others because they're getting ready to start World War III with Russia?
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:09.000]  You know, I think they're concerned with the advanced technology. I really think
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.720]  they're worried about perhaps somebody bugging the room. I think that they're panicking now
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.560]  because even though they can't hide with social media, with independent news agencies, alternative
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:25.640]  media like you becoming so popular, they have some serious questions to answer and they're
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:28.680]  going to look bad no matter what. People are going to wonder, wait, so this has been going
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:33.480]  on for 60 years. How come I haven't heard about this? And in part of my past activism,
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:39.320]  I would call up to the top radio talk show hosts, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly when he was on the
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:44.760]  radio, Glenn Beck, Alan Combs, et cetera. And I would just ask them, well, first of all,
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.360]  they would never take the call about the Bilderberg group. So I'd have to feed them a fake question
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.680]  about one of the current events of the day. And then when I was live on the air, I would ask them
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.120]  in a nice way, or it started off nice at least some of the future calls were a little more
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:00.280]  accusatory, about the Bilderberg group, just asking them, hey, can you tell everybody about
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:05.160]  this Bilderberg group and what they do? And all of them were bliss playing dumb. And so you can't
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:11.720]  tell me that these top rated talk show hosts that have their finger on the pulse of politics around
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.520]  the world don't know and haven't known for decades. But it was worse than that, because I've heard
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:22.280]  the calls we played them here. They would go, oh, shut up, conspiracy kook, nut, that's, that's
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:26.680]  Mark Dice. They knew they would call you conspiracy kook when they heard the word. They were saying
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:33.720]  it didn't exist. Yeah, now we have footage. We have smoked them out of their holes or published
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:38.280]  their tax returns. You know, when Hillary was running for president back in 2008, somebody
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.440]  approached her at a campaign event in New Hampshire and asked her what happens at the
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.520]  Bilderberg group and took the video. It's on YouTube. I'm sure that you've seen it. Much of
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.640]  your audience maybe saw the video and she said, I don't know what you're talking about. So here
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.880]  we have another lie. We have one of the most powerful women in the world, again, who lived in
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:01.960]  the White House, husband, former president, just simply doesn't have any idea. She was at Bilderberg.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:07.320]  She was at Bilderberg in 2008. And Jim Tucker reports that she was at Bilderberg back in the
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:15.000]  nineties as well. And so we have no politicians with the exception of Ron Paul and his son,
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.640]  Rand Paul. Nobody has mentioned the Bilderberg group with, I guess, the exception of a guy
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.320]  named John Rarick from the House of Representatives back in 1971, who entered in the congressional
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.400]  record. Well, that shows how powerful it is, Mark, that they will not talk about it.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:36.360]  It's no, you're not allowed to be curious or to have any questions about 100 of the most powerful
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:43.880]  men, intelligence agency officials, media executives, reporters, military brass meeting in a
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:49.240]  hotel with privacy fences set up for three days that's evacuated. And this is why it costs a
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.840]  million dollars to put on this conference every year because they have to compensate the hotel
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:59.000]  for the loss of revenue because hotels could have hundreds, perhaps 1,000 rooms and nobody is allowed
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.240]  in there except for the 100 or the 100. Mark, we got to get you on for a full hour to break down
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.600]  your new book soon. Amazing. And another full hour interview just to play highlights of the most
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:14.840]  insane stuff said by fascist brainwashed zombie worshiper globalist minions that we call liberals.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.560]  Thank you so much, Mark. Guys, we'll be back. Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us. Big news straight
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:23.560]  ahead.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:38.360]  Bilderberg 2015. You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious in
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:48.440]  Austria. We're about to be talking to Larry claiming with big breaking news until the bottom of the
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:55.720]  hour. Then 11 year old boy kidnapped by CPS. Parents accused after he played in the backyard
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:03.000]  alone for 90 minutes. I mean, when I was six years old, I was running around the neighborhood.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:09.640]  Now it's your backyard you're taking away. There's no law. It's just that any state calls it neglect.
[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:18.760]  We've got London Guardian reporters being rated at 1am at their hotel rooms in Austria for
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:23.880]  daring to cover the Bilderberg group. It is getting crazy. And that's all coming up at the bottom of
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:33.160]  the hour. One of my favorite actors has died. Christopher Lee, just an amazing actor. Here's
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.960]  the headline. Christopher Lee, an actor of muscular intelligence with a staggering career
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:46.840]  when Mr. Kleiman leaves us. I'll talk some about that briefly. Larry Kleiman, founder of judicial
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:52.360]  watch and freedom watch is known for his strong public interest advocacy in fartherance of ethics
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.760]  in government and individual freedoms and liberties. During his tenure at judicial watch, he obtained
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:02.840]  a court ruling that Bill Clinton committed a crime. The first ever lawyer to have done so against
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:08.120]  an American president. Larry became so famous for fighting corruption in the government and for
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:15.160]  legal profession that NBC hit drama series West Wing created a character after him. His character
[01:42:15.160 --> 01:42:21.640]  was played by and it just goes on. And I'm not going to break it all down at FreedomWatchUSA.org.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:26.520]  He's one of the most demonized people out there because the documents he gets, the research he
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:32.600]  does is so amazingly piercing and accurate over and over again. We have now entered complete
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.800]  insane asylum level with this government and this Justice Department and their persecution of the
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:43.400]  Tea Party, veterans, gun owners, filmmakers like Dinesh DeSousa. I mean, they couldn't die to ham
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:50.680]  sandwich. Republicans are basically going along with all of it. At the leadership level, Paul Ryan
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:58.920]  won't even, he says the TPP is public but that admits it isn't. Very Orwellian. But Mr. Kleiman
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:04.760]  is on, it's a WorldNet Daily article, two members of Supreme Court targeted by U.S. spies. There's
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:10.680]  been some leaks and a lot of speculation that the Supreme Court sudden change towards, well,
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:15.800]  being pro-gun a few years ago to now ruling against guns just last week in a San Francisco case
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.560]  really illustrates that they're being blackmailed. And see, that's the problem with having a
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:25.320]  compromised president or anybody. They can be blackmailed. Look at, look at Dennis Hastert.
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:31.000]  And so he's got some amazing information on this and other scandals. But if anybody can bring out
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  the scandals that can maybe stop these people, it's Larry Kleiman. But first, let me thank you for
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.040]  coming on and thank our listeners for supporting him and his important work and supporting one of
[01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:46.280]  the bravest people out there. But the overall climate, is Obama in trouble? Is he backing off?
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:51.240]  Is he more emboldened? He seems to be more emboldened, but everything he does falls apart,
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:57.000]  kicking out our allies in Egypt, putting basically Al Qaeda in, caught running ISIS. I mean,
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:02.840]  it's so villainous, Larry Kleiman, that I can't even believe it. I mean, it's, it's, it's, I've
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:08.360]  just, he makes Bill Clinton look like an angel cake. And I know the Clintons kind of run Obama
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.720]  to a certain extent. What is going on? I mean, what's next? What's the next shoe to drop, Larry
[01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:21.320]  Kleiman? So backing up Alex, you're absolutely right. I mean, we live in an age, not just the
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:26.520]  degradation of society, but the people who are running this country have not served this country.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:33.240]  In fact, they've behaved in a, in the case of Obama in a traitorous way. You know, we are
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.640]  really up against the wall internationally in what's happening, particularly in the Middle East
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:44.280]  with ISIS and, and Israel and the efforts to destroy Israel's ability to be our major ally
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:49.160]  there. Domestically, we're pushing towards the socialized economy. We're already there.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:54.520]  And we've got all these scandals on top of everything else. And one of the biggest scandals,
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:59.240]  of course, over the last few years has been the NSA scandal. You alluded to that in the
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:04.760]  beginning of your introduction, where the NSA and other intelligence agencies have access
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:10.200]  to all of our telephonic metadata, to our internet communications, to our social media
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:15.560]  contacts, and they have the ability to blackmail almost anybody they want. The reality here is,
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.480]  is that these agencies are in control of this country. Somebody made me behind them,
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:28.920]  but Obama, they let him do his little socialist thing and do whatever he can to destroy
[01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:33.880]  Israel and further Muslim interests in the Middle East. But they're playing a much bigger game
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:40.040]  here. And sometimes they likely return favors to each other. And that may help explain some of
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:44.760]  the bizarre Supreme Court decisions we've had and other kinds of rulings. We do know, in some
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:51.320]  matter of public record, that the intelligence agencies have actually penetrated the email
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:57.960]  and telephone communications, even judges in this country, and representatives and senators.
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:06.280]  So we live in an Arwellian state. Judge Richard Leon made that finding on December 16, 2013,
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:11.160]  when he enjoined the NSA. By the way, I should have added that you had one of the first and only
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:17.160]  victories against the NSA in a case you brought and argued. So I also forgot to add that you're
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:23.400]  a top constitutional lawyer. Sorry. Thanks, Alex. And that's the stakes that we have here. We're
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:28.440]  living under this sort of Damocles, ironic that we have this issue in Syria. That's where it came
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:34.760]  from. And if you step out of one, if you criticize the government, if you take strong action,
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:39.640]  the government wants you to know that they can retaliate and destroy you. And all we're trying
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.600]  to do cut and dry is save the country. No one can debate shutting down our power plants will
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:48.920]  bankrupt us. No one can debate opening our borders outside of law and saying everything's free will
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:55.080]  bankrupt us. No one can debate the war on families is happening. I mean, it's like we have Hugo Chavez
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:00.600]  on acid running the country. You're right. Now, you know, there are good people in government,
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:05.160]  but they're not the people in control. And if there are good people in government, and I know a few,
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.520]  you have to work with them to try to change things. And we've had good judges over the years,
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:14.760]  a couple of them. There are a lot of good people. So I mean, what percentage would you say are good
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:22.360]  side, bad side? Well, I would say 90% are bad, at least that's the conservative figure, either bad
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:27.400]  in the sense that they're acting in a malevolent way for their own interests. Like, you know,
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:32.760]  McConnell, Senator Majority Leader McConnell in the Senate, he lines his pockets along with Carl
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:38.120]  Rowe from the Republican side. And on the Democrat side, you have Nancy Pelosi and company lining
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:44.200]  their pockets. So the bottom line is, is that we don't really have any representation in Washington.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:49.800]  And that's why I have to do what I do in my little way at Freedom Watch and before that at
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:54.840]  Judicial Watch. And you do what you do, Alex, because we have to wage a peaceful new American
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:59.880]  Revolution here. And we have to put our foot down. And whatever it takes to do that, whether it's
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:05.160]  bringing lawsuits against the NSA, or bringing lawsuits, racketeering lawsuits against Hillary
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:10.520]  Clinton for selling waivers to Iran in exchange for contributions to the Clinton Foundation,
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.240]  I have a case down in Southern District of Florida right now. I'm no constitutional lawyer, but
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:22.760]  being in the State Department, taking money from foreign states to then unblock weapons transfers
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:32.120]  to ship weapons, I mean, that sounds like a James Bond villain. It does. And challenging him on
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:37.800]  immigration, I have a case for Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his executive orders, it's in the District
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:43.000]  of Columbia, we also intervened in the Texas case by filing the meekest briefs. We have to cover
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.040]  the where front, we have to use whatever tools we have. Because with this power of these intelligence
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:53.560]  agencies to intercept our telephone messages, our email communications, our social media contacts,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:49:01.720]  our founding fathers, they had lived under this in 1776 of George III, I'm not talking about Bush,
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:05.480]  I'm talking about King George III, and had these powers, they wouldn't have made it to
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.960]  Philadelphia, they would have picked up the rest and executed before they got there. So it's almost
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:15.000]  impossible to wage a revolution today, like our founding fathers did, we have to use whatever
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:21.240]  means we can, peaceful non-violence, Alan Martin Luther King, Alan Nelson Mandela,
[01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:27.400]  Alan Lekwylensa in Poland, and use our legal system and hope that we find those good judges,
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:31.720]  who will put their foot forward, that's what we have. Well, you're involved in so many trailblazing
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:36.600]  things, but let's get into two members of Supreme Court targeted by U.S. spies. Tell us about that,
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:43.400]  Larry Claman. Well, we don't know much about that. All we know is that the intelligence agencies
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.960]  have been getting into their records. I don't know for a fact whether they've been blackmailed or not,
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:54.680]  but the potential is there. And when you see the decision at the end of the Obamacare analysis
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.040]  a few years back, where the Chief Justice all of a sudden flipped at the end, and in fact his
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:07.880]  decision was incomprehensible, first he says it isn't a tax, the Obamacare, and then he says it is,
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:12.440]  and he sustains it as Congress' power to tax, you have to really wonder what's going on.
[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:17.880]  And that's why it's good to expose these things, because, you know, fundamentally,
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:23.560]  the Chief Justice, I hope this time he rules differently, but he has not played it straight,
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:28.280]  and that destroys confidence in our court system. It sure did. I mean,
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:32.520]  anybody knows Obamacare is not constitutional. It's not enforced universally.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:37.080]  The whole thing's a fraud. They change it all the time. I mean, it's just a monstrosity.
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.880]  Absolutely. And, you know, another number of other decisions coming out of the courts,
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:48.360]  you know, sustaining things that just simply are not sustainable. Whether you're for gay marriage
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.880]  or not, it's the right of the state, and we're going to see what comes out of the Supreme Court
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:56.680]  on that one too. That's a highly vulnerable decision that should be made on the state level,
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:03.880]  whether you agree with it or not. Immigration law. The President said he's not an emperor,
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:09.400]  yet he puts it into effect. Our Congress cowers away and does nothing. Our Congress should be
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:13.240]  submitting articles of impeachment right now to get this guy out of there. But no, they're playing
[01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:17.400]  games, because they're hoping that maybe they'll win the next presidential election. But by that
[01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:22.680]  time, Alex, 18 months down the line, our country could be destroyed. I mean, we're already on the
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:28.200]  ropes. We're already close to the corruption. So what are we going to do? And that's the question
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.400]  that you pose and I pose. And I'm doing what I can in the courts, but the American people need
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:37.720]  to rise up and they need to tell the representative, ship up or ship out. Well, they need to support
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:42.840]  FreedomWatchUSA.org. I know you didn't come on to ask for donations or support. Folks, better pray
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:48.920]  for you. No one is more aggressive and bold. Probably 60% of the good lawsuits out there
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.840]  are coming from you. We used to have Greg Abbott before he was governor suing the feds. He's still
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:57.640]  doing it. He's good. But man, we need to fight this anyway we can. Larry Klayman,
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:03.960]  FreedomWatchUSA.org is our guest. I want to come back and ask him what else he's looking at,
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:09.000]  what concerns him most and any positive news he's got for us. But the most positive thing
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.880]  is at least we know we're in deep trouble. We're not asleep. So we're not here trying to scare
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:18.440]  you folks. We're here telling you the house is on fire. We have some really deviant people run
[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:37.640]  in the country right now. Stingray, Stingray. It's being a Stingray.
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:46.920]  Larry Klayman went to federal court, won against the NSA. One of the major cases out there, the
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:52.200]  media really hated that a few years ago. And now he's moving forward with other cases and the five,
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:53:00.040]  six months we've got left, Mr. Klayman. What's the good news? A, B, what else are you most
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.480]  concerned about right now? Tell us about some of the other actions you're involved in.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.600]  We may have lost his audio. We've had some issues with the board today.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:19.400]  So we'll figure out what's happening with that audio and try to get him back up here in just a
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:30.040]  moment. Speaking of tyranny, this article really makes my head spin. 11-year-old boy kidnapped by
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:45.560]  CPS. Parents arrested after he played in backyard alone for 90 minutes. A couple in Florida were
[01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:52.840]  arrested in charge with felony neglect after their 11-year-old son was left alone in the backyard
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:58.040]  playing basketball for 90 minutes. He ought to be given a medal, but he wasn't playing video games.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.240]  Furthermore, the child was taken from the parents and placed into foster care.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:08.760]  The remarkable story was related to the website Free Range Kids, which advocates raising children
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:13.080]  to be self-reliant. We got to get that lady back on rather than succumbing to the nanny state,
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:19.880]  I guess TV coffins that they place people in now. First it was seven-year-olds and eight-year-olds
[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:24.600]  and nine-year-olds and 10-year-olds. I mean, 11-year-old in their backyard.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:32.440]  I mean, when I was 11, I would walk sometimes if my parents weren't home or were going to give me a
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:42.840]  ride five miles to a pool party. You know, there were cheerleaders there, literally, or whatever,
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:48.600]  and then somebody would give me a ride back. And sometimes I couldn't get a ride back and I remember
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:52.680]  I'd walk because there was a railroad track that would run right into town that was quicker than
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.440]  taking the roads and I could walk into a whole bunch of the neighborhoods that were there. I mean,
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:03.640]  I'd walk sometimes six, seven miles and then I'd be like, you know, 12, 13 years old and then I'd
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:09.720]  call back from whoever's house I was at and I'd say, Dad, you want to come pick me up? And he
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.080]  usually would say, Yeah, sure. Somebody would say, Hey, I told you I'm at a business meeting and your
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:16.920]  mom's out of town. You're going to have to just walk back. I remember walking back sometimes it'd
[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:22.280]  be, you know, 10 at night by the time I got home. It was awesome. Railroad tracks at night, owls flying
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:26.920]  by because we lived out on the edge of Dallas. So it was like countryside. Now it's all skyscrapers
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:33.800]  where I grew up or big buildings, but it was countryside part of it. And I mean, that was
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:38.120]  normal for my dad because he used to get sent places to work during the summer and apprentice
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:48.200]  at oil refinery and steel mill at different things is just to have the experience. He
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:53.240]  wasn't child labor. They would just send him to get different experiences so that he wouldn't be
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:59.320]  a moron. But instead now, Oh, keep your children inside watching television all day. And if they
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:06.600]  go in the backyard and play basketball, we're going to take them. The boy found himself locked out
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.440]  of the family home in April at his parents who came stuck in traffic was that happened all the
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:15.160]  time. A busy body neighbor decided that this was far too dangerous and called the cops.
[01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:21.400]  When the parents arrived home, they were put in handcuffs, strip search, fingerprinted and
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:26.840]  subsequently held overnight in jail. Meanwhile, the boy and his four year old brother, who was
[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:32.760]  not left alone at the time, were taken into the custody of police and handed to a relative.
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:37.800]  It emerged that for 48 hours while the handover was being sorted out, the children were not,
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.200]  were only fed cereal and were not encouraged to wash. Well, of course, it's the government,
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.400]  why should they have to do that? After a few weeks of not being able to see their kids, the
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:50.360]  couple discovered that the relative was caring for them, had enough and was handing the children
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:55.000]  over to CPS, whose lawyers asked the judge to place the children in foster care. When the parents
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  came to court, there was a back and forth arrangement between CPS and the lawyer and the
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.240]  family's lead representative that went on for hours. It was only after 11 year old boys spoke
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:08.120]  to the judge that Sandy prevailed. He went back there, spoke to the judge for about 10 minutes,
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:13.400]  and the mother told free range kids. And then the judge came out and called the two lawyers
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:18.760]  to the bench and talked to them for about 10 or 15 minutes. And after that, our lawyer came to us
[01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:23.960]  and said, if we admitted that we didn't know that it was wrong for our son to stay in the backyard,
[01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:29.720]  but that we would know that it's wrong and we'll never let it happen again, that we will explain
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:36.120]  this to our son, he would let the children come with us. The parents agreed to the terms,
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.200]  so the system wouldn't feel guilty and were allowed to take their children home a month after the
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:45.960]  incident originally occurred. And they're now taking parenting classes. I mean, I can't tell you
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:53.640]  how many times that my parents were supposed to pick me up somewhere and gotten traffic or
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:58.760]  had a problem and were 30 minutes an hour late. I mean, whoop-de-doo. That's why we're raising
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:03.560]  a bunch of jellyfish that don't know what planet they're on, because they don't know anything.
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:08.360]  I mean, there was a convenience store a mile and a half from the house. My mother had me walk
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:13.480]  there every week to get her something. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. I need to be
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:42.440]  out of the house. Alex Jones in the GCN radio network.
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:54.360]  You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A great high, littlest, breathed in flame. I have so. He is
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:59:00.040]  gathering all the evil to him. Very soon he will summon the army great enough to launch an assault
[01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:10.920]  upon Middle Earth. You know this. I have seen it. But the land here is a dangerous tool, Son of
[01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:22.520]  Man. Why? Why should we fear to use it? They are not all accounted for. The last six homes.
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:32.680]  We do not know who else may be watching. The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:44.920]  already moving. The nine have left Minas Mortimer. The TPT. He is prepared. Disguised as writers
[01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:54.040]  in black. They've reached the Sauron. They will find the ring and kill the one who carries it.
[01:59:54.040 --> 02:00:07.720]  Right on. We must duel with the new world order. Take your shots.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:13.240]  We are not seriously thinking that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron. There are none
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:27.080]  who can. Against the power of Malton, there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf.
[02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:41.560]  We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend. Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:53.400]  wise abandoned reason for madness?
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:32.120]  I gave you the chance of meeting me willingly with you and electing the way of peace.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:56.920]  We now. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:05.960]  It's Alex Jones. It was Christopher Lee that changed our image of Count Dracula from the German
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:16.600]  Nosferatu to the now classical Dracula in the tuxedo. He was in over 400 films, one of my favorite
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:21.640]  actors. Even being a B movie, I had to watch it because he was in it. Incredible presence.
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:26.200]  And I kept seeing him in big movies. Count Dooku, you name it, and the New Star Wars.
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:31.320]  I was like, man, how does this guy just keep going and going and going and going while he's
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:35.720]  dead? And you know what? We don't get into entertainment news, but we like to celebrate
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:44.040]  interesting people. And he's dead at age 93. Christopher Lee, an actor of muscular intelligence
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:49.560]  with a staggering career, the Guardian writes, from his electrifying roles as Count Dracula to his
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:56.200]  venerable turn in Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, Christopher Lee possessed a rare grace
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:03:01.080]  and charm. Yeah, the globalists say humans are ugly and bad and failed. It's pure bull.
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:07.640]  Humans are amazing. And we celebrate humans that have gotten us to think and given us joy.
[02:03:07.640 --> 02:03:12.840]  And so by my eyes, Christopher Lee, there you go. All these other globalists that think they're
[02:03:12.840 --> 02:03:19.160]  going to hang on to life forever. Everybody dies. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Remember that.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:26.280]  Yeah, James Bond villains, you name it. But I think that's one of his best roles as a Saruman.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:30.920]  Man, I tell you, that first Lord of the Rings is such a excellent movie, cinematically,
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:38.360]  he's done so well. And the new ones are just video game trash. I took my son to see the
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:46.200]  last one and it was World of Warcraft computer program. You could see the cuts in the arms
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:51.800]  because they're like movable dolls basically in a computer program. You could see the segmented
[02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:57.480]  arms and legs in the battles. I mean, but that's because the public accepts it. And those movies
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:05.480]  make even more money. The new Marvel comic movie, I wouldn't see just to analyze it.
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:12.760]  The Avengers, the worst thing I've ever seen. I mean, just they don't even try to make it good.
[02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.320]  It is just walls of crud. And I've told that's what they've done with the new
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:26.600]  movie that's coming out Jurassic Park. So that's what's sick about it. I mean, the last
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:33.240]  Captain America had a really good message. It was really good. It was fantastical,
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:37.800]  but not unbelievable. Now I was watching because they had like a 10 minute thing at the beginning
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:43.160]  of another film. I went to see with a sneak peek from Marvel of what's coming up where they admitted.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:47.880]  They had like the head of Marvel up there talking. They had their film division
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:54.680]  talking about how people want these new more exciting CG films. So, you know, the next Captain
[02:04:54.680 --> 02:05:00.120]  America will be like that too. And it's just like, oh my gosh, you know, I like fantasy as much as
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:08.520]  the next person, but man, unwatchable. I've seen online on YouTube, some of these channels have
[02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:14.280]  billions of views where people go and they play video games. And that's more interesting to watch
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:21.000]  somebody play video games. I don't really do that, but I've looked at it to understand culture
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:26.840]  than the last Lord of the Rings. I mean, I was watching them lazily, basically with a
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:35.880]  pre-programmed video game, play a video game. I mean, the dragon in the Desolation of Smog
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:39.000]  was still pretty good. It was still kind of cartoonish. You know, they just get worse and
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:43.400]  worse as they go. But by the next one, the dragon looks like a tinker toy or something.
[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:49.800]  They just don't care because the public's so dumbed down. It's going to be like television
[02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:57.000]  and idiocracy soon, where your easy chair is a toilet and you just sit there all day watching
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:04.200]  someone be kicked in the groin area over and over again. I mean, or people falling and people
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:10.120]  getting hurt. I mean, that's all it is. It's just the most mindless trash you could ever see.
[02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:15.560]  I mean, you could see maybe like the Godfather, one or two, but especially one. And it's like
[02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:23.400]  you're there in that house, the lighting, the actors. It's so well done. It takes you there.
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:29.320]  And you've got something. The polar opposite of that now is what cinema's become. And it isn't me,
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:35.000]  some old guy who's 41, who can't handle the new cool stuff. Everyone admits they're dumbing
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:47.560]  the culture down on purpose. Peter Cushing is another amazing actor.
[02:06:51.960 --> 02:06:54.120]  Evacuate moments of triumph.
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:01.800]  I saw some movie when I was on the elliptical months ago.
[02:07:01.800 --> 02:07:05.800]  You'll pull up the house at the one at the gym where it's like
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:15.560]  Yeti Bigfoot in Nepal. And, you know, it's really cheesy B movie. It looks like it's from 1950.
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:22.600]  I forget the name of the movie, but just because it had Peter in it, you couldn't stop watching it.
[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:28.280]  He just was such an interesting person. Where are those actors today? I mean, it's just, it's
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:33.880]  just, it's embarrassing. And then even though they're a decent actor, they usually have some
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:38.760]  horrible, you know, obsession with taking my guns when they have bodyguards. I mean, they're just,
[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:48.840]  you know, Piers Morgan has armed bodyguards at his house. He admits it, but I can't have guns.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:54.520]  I mean, it's, but see, he deserves to have armed bodyguards. I don't see. I can't afford armed
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:59.160]  bodyguards. I mean, I guess I could wouldn't be in the budget to send three reporters to Switzerland
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:07.160]  or to Austria or to Greece. But I'm digressing. I got two special reports I want to play.
[02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:12.280]  Speaking of money, we fund ourselves with high quality products, the best pro liberty t-shirts,
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:18.280]  ball caps, belt buckles, holding made in America section, the nutraceuticals, 20% off,
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:26.200]  propure pitchers, best deal out there infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:34.120]  Got the new upside down American flag with the flag code under it saying, save the republic.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:42.120]  And then it says on the back, our republic is in distress. Ask me why infowars.com.
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:49.400]  We have those shirts. That's the newest shirt. I come up with the concept. So I get all the blame,
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:55.160]  but it's very popular. It's a great way to wake folks up infowarslife.com and for store.com
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:00.680]  or 888-253-3139. And then of course, there's presentplanet.tv. One membership
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:07.400]  is really 20 memberships, 20 people can use each username and passcode. Please keep sharing those
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:10.840]  with friends and family. More and more folks are watching every day and we're waking them up.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:14.840]  There's also the free streams of the daytime show at infowars.com forward slash show, but
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:19.000]  the folks that are presentplanet.tv members really helped finance so much of what we're doing.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:25.480]  I told you last week that survival shield, nasa9ix2, or about two weeks ago, was set to sell out.
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:34.760]  It did sell out. We were manufacturing more at the facility, the laboratory. It got shipped in
[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:44.280]  today and it is a very small run. And then we are scrambling to try to secure and jump through
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:48.680]  all the hoops because we can get it. You just have to then go through regulatory hoops to have
[02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:53.880]  it transferred to you each time. That's why I told group this time, the next time we secure some,
[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:59.720]  I want to get a ton of it like a three year supply because we got this two years ago or almost two
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:05.320]  years ago and are just now running out. I'm like, why didn't we order a bunch more? I mean, we could
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:10.360]  be three, four months, six months maybe? I'm not mad at anybody. It's just that this is one of our
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:18.920]  best selling items. I love it. I use it. It's amazing. infowars, store.com, infowarslife.com,
[02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:22.520]  a limited run is down here if you want it. I want to share with your friends and family,
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:27.160]  consult a physician because when you've been deficient in iodine and your thyroid is full
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:32.840]  of all the bad halogens, it can be pretty dramatic the changes. What I had happen was amazing. Energy,
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:37.240]  weight loss, whole nine yards, you've heard the rate reviews, infowarslife.com, but this is serious
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:45.000]  stuff unlike any other iodine out there. infowarslife.com or 888-253-313. If you want it, now's the time
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:51.320]  to get it. It'll probably sell out in a week at the rate it's there and you will still have the
[02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:59.960]  original survival shield and it's excellent as well. infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139. I have
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:06.440]  several special reports here, one by John Bowne and then one by Leigh Ann McAdoo that I wanted to
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:23.400]  get to. Here he is, John Bowne's latest excellent report and then we will come back after the break.
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:39.720]  People don't remember when I came into office the United States in world opinion ranked below
[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:46.520]  China and just barely above Russia and today once again the United States is the most respected
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:54.440]  country on earth and part of that I think is because of the work that we did to re-engage the
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:12:00.040]  world and say that we want to work with you as partners with mutual interest and mutual respect.
[02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:05.800]  He's just wrong, flat wrong and delusional which appears to have become the norm for US presidents
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:10.840]  since Richard Nixon completely transformed the office into a den of iniquity. If he had seen
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:16.680]  the poll his aides must have given it to him upside down. In February of 2014 a Gallup poll
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:23.960]  revealed that for the first time the majority of Americans at 53% agreed that President Obama is
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:31.080]  not respected by other world leaders. Obama's aides probably shredded the 2014 BBC poll showing
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:37.000]  that the US is seventh and mainly negative ratings under China, Russia, Israel, Pakistan,
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.720]  North Korea and Iran at number one. Baby Obama is confusing corporate leaders with world leaders.
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:48.520]  He recently made the Brazilian and German leaders furious when it was revealed that they had been
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:53.720]  personally spied on. I have made it clear to the president of the United States that spying on
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:59.320]  friends is not acceptable at all. I said that when he was in Berlin in July and also yesterday in a
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:06.920]  telephone call. It's not just about me but about every German citizen. Citizens' personal data
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:13.000]  and information have been indiscriminately targeted and intercepted. Business information,
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:20.280]  often times of high economic and even strategic value, have been the target of spying activity.
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:26.600]  We're able to end two wars while still focusing on the very real threat of terrorism
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:33.160]  and to try to work with our partners on the ground in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:37.480]  What do you make of even Bloomberg reporting that basically the US is working with al-Qaeda
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:41.400]  to take over Iraq? I mean this is insane and take over areas of Syria.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:46.280]  That was clear. This whole operation was to start it with getting rid of Saddam
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:53.320]  and then Qaddafi in Libya and now Assad in Syria, Yemen, now a mess, a civil war.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:59.960]  All those governments were secular and now we run the risk of them being replaced by these
[02:13:59.960 --> 02:14:09.160]  Salafist regimes where, as you say, they not only kill Shias, other Sunni Muslims, Christians,
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:18.680]  and other minorities but also destroy antiquities, priceless, irreplaceable world heritage sites.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:24.120]  Execute women if they get caught not wearing gloves. I mean give me a break man. Our government's
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.920]  funding people that sexually mutilate women and make them wear gloves. I mean I'm done.
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:35.160]  I'm done with the scum that runs our government. Was the airdrop of weapons and supplies to ISIS
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:41.560]  really a mistake? After all it's always been the ultimate goal of the United States and its allies
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:49.560]  to put boots on the ground in Syria and to remove al-Assad from power. The mistaken airdrop could
[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:57.640]  be used as an excuse to send in US ground forces. But wait a minute. Why on earth would the US
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:03.960]  government purposely give ISIS terrorist weapons? I mean these are the same Muslim extremists who
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:09.800]  are going around beheading journalists and executing Christians right now. Do you mean to
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:15.160]  tell me the US government is so corrupt that they're so evil that they would actually do something
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:23.480]  like that? Oh yes, yes they would. And the evidence is overwhelming. In fact the palette of weapons
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:29.400]  that has supposedly ended up in the wrong hands what's really insignificant compared to the total
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:35.880]  ISIS arsenal. Not only does ISIS have in their possession tons of weaponry taken from the
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:43.160]  retreating Iraqi forces but the terrorist army now has long-range artillery and thousands of
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:51.160]  automatic weapons courtesy of the good old USA. Here's John McCain standing next to a no. That's
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:55.160]  right standing with the leaders. It's a longer report. There's about six minutes left. It's the
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:02.920]  delusions of King Obama. We're going to repost it to infowars.com and we're going to tweet it out
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:08.520]  at real Alex Jones. We want to see the full report and then when we come back we're going to hit
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:12.760]  some other top stories I've not gotten to yet. I don't know if we'll have time to do Leigh Ann's
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:28.680]  report. I wanted to but it was on the nightly news last night. I'm Alex Jones. Please stay with us.
[02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:33.320]  I want to play Leigh Ann McAdoo's report on laser weapons in the U.S. military
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:38.040]  and I want to get to an excellent report Kit Daniels did in Overdrive dealing with the
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:42.760]  Bilderberg cooking up the oil crisis that Jim Tucker documented so we'll do that.
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:48.920]  I have one other piece of news we'll hit in the next segment but here is Leigh Ann McAdoo's report
[02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:53.000]  then Homeland Security secretly videotaping citizens to predict pre-crime.
[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:58.440]  Not being satisfied with laser weapons that are both invisible and silent.
[02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.200]  Companies like Boeing have announced that they're going to be taking their laser weapons to the next
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:08.920]  level. Previously operators have had to pay close attention to know exactly when they've been firing
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:15.320]  these silent but deadly weapons. Now their lasers will be equipped with Star Trek and Star Wars
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:21.160]  sound effects. So next time Boeing's high-energy laser mobile demonstrators shoot down a drone
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:27.560]  mid-flight it's going to sound exactly like Han Solo's blaster. But that isn't all that science
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:34.040]  fiction has influenced. In addition to cell phones and ion propulsion and handheld devices
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:40.040]  Star Trek and Star Wars have also influenced futurists like Ray Kurzweil. Kurzweil is once
[02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:44.440]  again repeating his prediction that humans will meld with computers in the future.
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:51.480]  But instead of 2045 Kurzweil is now suggesting cyborgs will be a reality by the 2030s.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:55.800]  The director of engineering at Google said that people will soon be able to connect their
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:02.440]  brains directly to the cloud and augment their existing intelligence with thousands of computers.
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:08.200]  Thanks to DNA nanobots making the connection our thinking will become a hybrid of biological
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:14.440]  and non-biological thinking. Kurzweil adds that by the early 2040s people will be more like
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:19.960]  machines than they will be human. And he even suggests that we'll be able to back up our brains
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:26.440]  like a hard drive. But guess what? Star Trek already conquered this territory in the 90s.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:32.680]  I am the borg. The cyborg represents the dark side of humanity. What happens when technology
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:39.160]  falls into the wrong hands and is used to dehumanize us. The Star Trek borgs became one with their
[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:44.920]  technology that stripped them of their humanity and their individuality. They became like zombies
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:50.280]  in a metal shell. They were now part of a collective network on a vast computer system
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:55.960]  controlled telepathically by this mysterious borg queen. Kind of makes you think there's
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:01.560]  a possibility something could be telepathically controlling us if we ever were to upload our
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:09.880]  brains to the cloud as Kurzweil suggests. Assimilate this. And even though we hear the
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:16.280]  word singularity by 2045, the fact is man merging with machine has already happened.
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:21.400]  Professor Kevin Warwick is head of the cybernetics and robotics department at Reading University
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:28.760]  in the UK. In 1998 he was able to connect his nervous system to the internet via a chip implanted
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:35.320]  in his arm. He then used the web to allow him to control a robotic arm. And that was in the 90s.
[02:19:35.320 --> 02:19:41.640]  And he, like Kurzweil and other transhumanists, give this ominous warning that by not upgrading
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:48.040]  we would be considered subspecies in the future. And surprise, surprise, artificial intelligence
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:54.040]  is one of the topics up for discussion at this year's Bilderberg conference. Former DARPA director
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:59.800]  and now Google exec Regina Dugan will be in attendance. Dugan is helping to develop and
[02:19:59.800 --> 02:20:05.800]  promote the idea of an ingestible identification microchip. Yeah, absolutely not worrisome at
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:12.760]  all that Google is now hiring military leadership. Users would swallow a chip in pill form every day

[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:25.640]  for cell phones, cars, doors and other devices. But I'm sure it means absolutely nothing that
[02:20:25.640 --> 02:20:30.200]  artificial intelligence will be discussed this week at a top secret meeting of the world's
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:35.880]  power brokers when people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking have warned that artificial
[02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:42.840]  intelligence has the potential to destroy humanity if it falls in the wrong hands. I have one simple
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:48.680]  request and that is to have sharks with freaking laser beams attached to their heads.
[02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:54.360]  All right, we're going into overdrive. God bless you all in FullWars.com forward slash

[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:03.480]  but he wants to restrict everybody else's air travel and carbon taxes. Tell you about that coming
[02:21:03.480 --> 02:21:15.880]  up too. Visit GCNLive.com today. From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines,
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:23.080]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. All right, I'm going
[02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:27.560]  to shoot a special report for the nightly news getting into this article at Drudge Report.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:35.880]  Obama cracks down on airplane emissions buys massive new Air Force One, biggest ever, longest ever
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:40.680]  big special plane, huge emissions, but that's okay because government's exempt. They're coming out
[02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:46.040]  with these new emissions that are basically taxes for the rest of the aircraft industry, basically
[02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:50.120]  crippling U.S. manufacturers because the foreign manufacturers like Airbus won't follow it.
[02:21:52.520 --> 02:21:57.640]  But this bypasses all the chemtrailing that's being added to the jet fuel, the barium salts,
[02:21:57.640 --> 02:22:04.760]  the aluminum dioxide that we know is going on the geoengineering. We are not in Kansas anymore
[02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:09.560]  and it is a dystopic situation that we're going into. We're trying to change that.

[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:17.720]  so many markets as LIBOR has shown us and currency speculation has shown us.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:23.560]  We live in a rigged market and that's what Kit Daniels broke down on this excellent report.
[02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:30.680]  KitDanielsInfoWars.com. Did you know the Bilderberg group was directly responsible for the 1973 oil
[02:22:30.680 --> 02:22:35.320]  crisis that occurred here in America? Most people think it was OPEC that orchestrated the entire
[02:22:35.320 --> 02:22:41.080]  thing, but that wasn't quite the case. It was in fact the Bilderberg group's idea. In May of 1973,
[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:46.440]  about five months before the oil crisis occurred, the Bilderberg group met in secret and the meeting
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:51.960]  included several CEOs of oil companies such as Exxon and British Petroleum, as well as President
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:57.880]  Nixon's National Security Advisor, Henry Kissinger. They predicted that soon there'd be about a 400%
[02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:04.440]  increase in the price of oil and then, you know, on October 6, 1973, after the meeting,
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.400]  the Young Kipper War occurred, which directly led to the increase in oil prices. But how did
[02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:15.800]  the Bilderberg group know this? They planned it. But why? As Economist F. William Engdahl noted in
[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:22.440]  his book, A Century of War, one enormous consequence of the ensuring 400% rise in OPEC oil prices was
[02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:27.400]  that investments of hundreds of millions of dollars by British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell,
[02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:32.600]  both of whom were present at the 1973 Bilderberg meeting, and other Anglo-American Petroleum
[02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:37.400]  concerns in the risky North Sea, could produce oil at a profit. He continued,
[02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:42.920]  the profitability of these new North Sea oil fields was not at all secure until after the OPEC price
[02:23:42.920 --> 02:23:49.320]  rises. So the Bilderberg group came up with the idea of an oil crisis to ensure profitability
[02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:54.840]  for the oil companies connected to Bilderberg. And the former oil minister for Saudi Arabia,
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:24:01.160]  Shia Q. Yamadi, confirmed this. In 2001, Yamadi said, I am 100% sure that the Americans were
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:05.640]  behind the increase in the price of oil. Oil companies were in real trouble at the time.
[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:09.480]  They had borrowed a lot of money and they needed a high oil price that saved them.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:15.560]  Yamadi also said that when he visited Iran in 1974 on official oil business, he was told that it
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:20.520]  was in fact Henry Kissinger who wanted to raise the oil prices, and that Kissinger wanted a war
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:26.600]  in the Middle East in order to justify the said price increase. And a few weeks before the Yom Kippur
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:33.320]  War occurred, Kissinger, who was now the Secretary of State under Nixon, he issued a statement saying
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:38.200]  that if there was a war that was going to break out in the Middle East, that U.S. military intervention
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:43.880]  was completely out of the question. Basically, Kissinger used secret diplomatic channels to
[02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:49.880]  ensure that not only would the war happen as badly as possible, but that OPEC would use the war to
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:56.680]  justify a price increase. Kissinger downplayed the war, for example, to President Nixon and took
[02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:02.440]  control of the situation himself. In fact, the National Security Agency found out about the war
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:07.560]  two days before it happened, but they were told by the White House under advisement from Kissinger
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.920]  to sit on the information. And also, Kissinger told the Israelis to stand down and let the war
[02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:19.960]  happen. And the rest, you know, is history. The war occurred, the U.S. gave arms to Israel to fight in
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:27.080]  the war, and then OPEC in response embargoed the U.S. thereby increasing oil prices. Now, I added
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:31.000]  some links in the video description below that go more into detail about the Bilderberg Group's
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.240]  involvement with the 1973 oil crisis. But at the very least, remember this, the oil crisis shows
[02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:41.800]  us exactly why we must constantly watch the Bilderberg Group and also begs the question,
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:46.200]  what are they up to now? Once again, this is Kit Daniels with infowars.com,
