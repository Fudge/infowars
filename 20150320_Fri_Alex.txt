[01:50.180 --> 02:01.660]  I'm having one of those rare moments where I can't talk and it's because I
[02:04.780 --> 02:17.460]  don't have words to properly break down how serious things are they say that
[02:17.460 --> 02:23.300]  John the revelator marveled in speechlessness as he was being given the
[02:23.300 --> 02:35.020]  revelation of in times in Armageddon he marveled at the beast and I've not been
[02:35.020 --> 02:41.100]  given some revelation 2,000 years ago I'm here watching it and I'm watching the
[02:41.100 --> 02:46.620]  general public somewhat awake in some areas but not awake in others having no
[02:46.620 --> 03:03.660]  idea how fantastical how sin sational reality really is I told you over and

[08:17.260 --> 08:24.980]  ladies and gentlemen we're going to cover undoubtedly here today the most
[08:24.980 --> 08:29.980]  important information we've ever gone over now in my 20 years on air I've
[08:29.980 --> 08:34.900]  probably said that 50 times and it's because as we progress down this
[08:34.900 --> 08:40.740]  globalist road we hit milestones of incredibly positive things but also
[08:40.740 --> 08:48.580]  incredibly sad and negative dark things and I'm going to go over the facts here
[08:48.580 --> 08:54.660]  there has been a long term at least 20 year program to militarize the police
[08:54.660 --> 09:01.980]  and prepare the military itself for governing the United States under an
[09:01.980 --> 09:06.580]  emergency restructuring of the United States into the North American Union under
[09:06.580 --> 09:13.660]  unelected global private corporate trade boards and secret treaties we would
[09:13.660 --> 09:16.980]  tell you about this 20 years ago Lou Dobbs and say about it 10 years ago and
[09:16.980 --> 09:21.300]  basically got fired now none of that is denied it's all out in the open they go
[09:21.300 --> 09:24.100]  yeah the global treaties are secret and you're now under foreign corporate
[09:24.100 --> 09:29.380]  corporate control we are being captured we are being seized the federal
[09:29.380 --> 09:33.900]  government has been taken over for a long time but it doesn't control all the
[09:33.900 --> 09:44.700]  states the counties the cities now about a month ago I was up in North Texas with
[09:44.700 --> 09:52.700]  a well-known billionaire Chuck Norris's son Mike Norris the filmmaker and some
[09:52.700 --> 09:57.540]  law enforcement people and others and got some key intel that it dovetail with
[09:57.540 --> 10:01.580]  information I had from Fort Hood and then I had separately from our sources in
[10:01.580 --> 10:07.620]  the State House at the highest levels that the state of Texas is aware of a
[10:07.620 --> 10:13.060]  takeover plan to bring us into martial law and to actually basically arrest
[10:13.060 --> 10:17.700]  state officials and that Texas will be the first state to be taken down under
[10:17.700 --> 10:24.940]  martial law now I I mentioned some of that back then but I said I was allowed
[10:24.940 --> 10:29.420]  to talk about it but that it was so hardcore that I wanted to collate more
[10:29.420 --> 10:34.500]  data before I told you what I was told exactly from the Fort Hood sources from
[10:34.500 --> 10:43.420]  the State House sources and from the basically Chuck Norris combined sources
[10:45.020 --> 10:49.420]  this is so much stranger than fiction
[10:51.700 --> 10:55.580]  and you've heard state judges come out and say we know there's a martial law
[10:55.580 --> 11:04.140]  plan for Texas and Lubbock and other areas this is known I've had three
[11:04.140 --> 11:12.020]  different groups from Fort Hood come to events that I've been at and they're
[11:12.020 --> 11:15.420]  sincere in what they say and what they're doing it's it's not and they're
[11:15.420 --> 11:18.940]  completely freaked out because they're now been told to engage in
[11:18.940 --> 11:24.740]  preparations for the takedown of counties and cities in Texas and of the
[11:24.740 --> 11:32.020]  state capital this is very dangerous information ladies and gentlemen now one
[11:32.020 --> 11:35.740]  of our insider sources said hey this is an open source document but they've got
[11:35.740 --> 11:41.580]  it hidden on one of their servers that's public but not listed but by law
[11:41.580 --> 11:46.780]  they're supposed to put this out US Army Special Operations Command request to
[11:46.780 --> 11:52.340]  conduct realistic military training RMT Jade Helm 15 it's a joint forces under
[11:52.340 --> 11:57.140]  Northcom and out of Colorado Springs and out of the US Army Special Operations
[11:57.140 --> 12:04.940]  Command out of Florida and is a unified program for two command bases to
[12:04.940 --> 12:09.980]  basically take over the entire state of Texas and they list in the official
[12:09.980 --> 12:16.420]  document two states in one zone they believe during a takedown of the
[12:16.420 --> 12:22.140]  Constitutional Republic that they will and this is all in here that that they
[12:22.140 --> 12:27.260]  will get resistance in and they and that's because they have NSA data they
[12:27.260 --> 12:31.220]  have future predicting systems they also know if I know this stuff they know
[12:31.220 --> 12:36.140]  this they know that Utah led by the Mormons say what you want about them
[12:36.140 --> 12:39.380]  the Mormons have been playing along with the government but the globalists
[12:39.380 --> 12:42.900]  have them all wiretapped and spied on they know the Mormons actually have
[12:42.900 --> 12:47.820]  plans not go along very rebellious to the globalist and they've also been
[12:47.820 --> 12:50.540]  smart enough to put their people throughout the government they've got a
[12:50.540 --> 12:54.780]  takedown plan at Utah they got a takedown plan at Texas where listed is
[12:54.780 --> 12:58.980]  hostile that's because that's basically all there is left in the country at a
[12:58.980 --> 13:03.140]  governmental level of anybody they think will resist they've got the
[13:03.140 --> 13:05.940]  demographics they've got the people in government either on the payroll or
[13:05.940 --> 13:11.220]  spied on everywhere else when governor Abbott got elected who we know is the
[13:11.220 --> 13:15.300]  real deal and I know this from private sources of money for years it's a very
[13:15.300 --> 13:19.020]  good Christian man you know the governor in the wheelchair he knows what's
[13:19.020 --> 13:22.700]  going on and it's been having private meetings I'm just going to leave it at
[13:22.700 --> 13:26.460]  that with people because these are not traders I mean they understand America's
[13:26.460 --> 13:30.540]  dying right now okay folks the country's gone the borders are gone their bank
[13:30.540 --> 13:34.460]  roughness we're going into slavery this is like France got taken down from
[13:34.460 --> 13:38.940]  within by the Vichy Hitler didn't take over France the general stood down then
[13:38.940 --> 13:42.980]  he just chased the British Expeditionary Force out to Dunkirk and then the
[13:42.980 --> 13:46.940]  French I mean Hitler a week after the invasion was already in Paris with the
[13:46.940 --> 13:51.220]  police are directing traffic for him and that's the type of takeover we see
[13:51.220 --> 13:57.900]  happening and Texas and Utah are aware of this they also have an area about 40
[13:57.900 --> 14:02.140]  miles into California that's controlled by Mexican drug cartels that the US Army
[14:02.140 --> 14:06.660]  expects to receive resistance when they try to occupy it three areas in the
[14:06.660 --> 14:12.580]  United States in this jurisdiction they don't listen to the map the Midwest but
[14:12.580 --> 14:16.580]  I'll guarantee Indiana's on it and I'll guarantee you New Hampshire's somewhat on
[14:16.580 --> 14:21.020]  it and I'll guarantee you to a certain extent Tennessee's on it when we get the
[14:21.020 --> 14:25.860]  full map the rest of this is classified but this is because they're now putting
[14:25.860 --> 14:33.580]  this out in the public as a scyop to hide it in plain view that yes we're
[14:33.580 --> 14:38.020]  preparing for national stabilization and that we're preparing to win the hearts
[14:38.020 --> 14:41.420]  and minds locally it says that in the document it's in our article as well then
[14:41.420 --> 14:45.900]  they add oh and also this is good training for overseas now it's interesting
[14:45.900 --> 14:50.340]  this was the biggest or you could argue second largest prisoner of war camp in
[14:50.340 --> 14:58.780]  World War two was camp swift out between Bastrop and Smithville this is where
[14:58.780 --> 15:02.060]  they're gonna be running the operation with the entire combined forces of the
[15:02.060 --> 15:07.020]  US military but that is groups from all of them Air Force special operations
[15:07.020 --> 15:11.860]  Army special operations Delta Force Navy SEALs all of them to run civilian
[15:11.860 --> 15:15.540]  operations and this is also to assess which police departments are gonna go
[15:15.540 --> 15:20.780]  along with it and they basically admit all that in the document so you want to
[15:20.780 --> 15:28.620]  see trees and folks we've known about this for a long time but this is it and
[15:28.620 --> 15:35.900]  they're training to take over basically government buildings to go into hardened
[15:35.900 --> 15:44.100]  courthouses the Capitol and basically take the governor and other people out
[15:44.100 --> 15:48.540]  and that's in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act Bush was involved
[15:48.540 --> 15:54.980]  1997 excuse me 2007 the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says for
[15:54.980 --> 15:58.380]  insurrection in the states including by the state legislatures or governors
[15:58.380 --> 16:04.140]  it's not insurrection it's duty the government's been seized at the federal
[16:04.140 --> 16:11.420]  level we're wide open and now they're going to deploy massive amounts of
[16:11.420 --> 16:15.980]  military to practice basically taking over Austin they're gonna have
[16:15.980 --> 16:20.820]  helicopters flying around downtown explosions all of it and they even talk
[16:20.820 --> 16:24.540]  about running into opposition when they do it and they're talking about me I'm
[16:24.540 --> 16:28.260]  the famous guy for chasing the black helicopters only because the San Antonio
[16:28.260 --> 16:32.460]  Police Chief Houston Police Kingsville Emergency Manager Thomas Sanchez's
[16:32.460 --> 16:36.420]  Army Intelligence and they came to him and said it's martial law training for
[16:36.420 --> 16:39.900]  gun confiscation Clinton wants to test the states and see who's gonna be an
[16:39.900 --> 16:43.580]  opposition well they know from the demographics the reason they're worried
[16:43.580 --> 16:49.300]  about Texas and Utah and I'm not saying these governments are perfect but we're
[16:49.300 --> 16:52.740]  probably to get Joel Scalzen on immediately in fact even today I know
[16:52.740 --> 16:58.140]  we've got Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and I know we've got John McAvy coming on but
[16:58.140 --> 17:02.580]  maybe at one we got 30 minutes there 1 to 130 get him on because I know he has
[17:02.580 --> 17:08.300]  high-level sources in the Utah government in the Salt Lake government
[17:08.300 --> 17:12.180]  and he's been talking about believing Texas and Utah would be the main
[17:12.180 --> 17:16.780]  opposition points Texas has been so overrun by third-world populations though
[17:16.780 --> 17:22.780]  that the entire east and south will fall pretty much immediately to the feds and
[17:22.780 --> 17:26.180]  they think the big war the top analysts is going to be fought in the Hill
[17:26.180 --> 17:31.860]  Country and into West Texas in the Panhandle this is this is what the
[17:31.860 --> 17:37.340]  Pentagon's training for folks to I mean this is high treason this is over the
[17:37.340 --> 17:45.660]  top and I cannot believe we've fallen this far that they would I already knew
[17:45.660 --> 17:49.580]  about all this in these maps I already knew they were training at Fort Hood to
[17:49.580 --> 17:54.300]  take out the government and you know why the military so wake they are going
[17:54.300 --> 18:02.940]  what on what we training to take over government buildings in Texas are you
[18:02.940 --> 18:08.580]  joking and that's why they fired hundreds of generals thousands of
[18:08.580 --> 18:11.900]  officers under them I mean they are just because they are finding out who will
[18:11.900 --> 18:16.780]  go along they've got it they've got a train for this to identify their
[18:16.780 --> 18:20.300]  enemies in the military because they're gonna purge that and let me tell the
[18:20.300 --> 18:25.140]  military something if you kind of halfway go along with this and they
[18:25.140 --> 18:30.020]  carry out this purge read about night of the long knives the first thing the
[18:30.020 --> 18:32.940]  globalists will do they've done this in every country they control and so of
[18:32.940 --> 18:37.260]  other similar systems they always follow the same narrative it's it's it's
[18:37.260 --> 18:43.580]  criminology but it also works you think they hate veterans now in police you
[18:43.580 --> 18:47.980]  help carry out the slitting of the throat of this country and the heart of

[25:07.140 --> 25:11.380]  just like the German military wasn't bad at first Hitler was bad we you have
[25:11.380 --> 25:15.420]  bad people running it and we know most of the military's awake but Joe
[25:15.420 --> 25:19.460]  unprecedented what did your friend say to you. So yeah this is the guy that I
[25:19.460 --> 25:24.300]  served with in Iraq a long time ago and he now works with a special operations
[25:24.300 --> 25:28.540]  command Socom out of Tampa in Florida and he's like hey man is like I saw what
[25:28.540 --> 25:31.900]  you guys were talking about yesterday that's a bunch of BS man he's like you
[25:31.900 --> 25:34.780]  know what it's just psychological operations don't worry about it stop
[25:34.780 --> 25:39.020]  pushing your propaganda against our operation you know we're clearly over
[25:39.020 --> 25:43.980]  the target when when when they come and reach out to me like that and I can tell
[25:43.980 --> 25:47.660]  that we've struck a nerve you know you're over the target and you're really
[25:47.660 --> 25:54.500]  on to what's going on I mean these guys I expect more of this coming from Socom
[25:54.500 --> 25:59.020]  over the next few days. Well I mean it's like we're bad because we didn't want
[25:59.020 --> 26:02.620]  al-Qaeda to be backed against Assad two years later we're writing everybody
[26:02.620 --> 26:07.580]  agrees with us including the Secretary of State the military has reached out to
[26:07.580 --> 26:12.820]  us they're in the news saying we don't want to be trained to take guns they
[26:12.820 --> 26:16.140]  they say in all the public documents they're training this is in Forbes
[26:16.140 --> 26:22.620]  magazine for war with the Tea Party with Northcom it's treason the Tea Party is
[26:22.620 --> 26:26.580]  the most law abiding group out there and that's what Texas is listed as an
[26:26.580 --> 26:32.180]  enemy by Southern command and they know we can break away there they have our
[26:32.180 --> 26:35.620]  own resources we have everything and then you have the 1033 program as well
[26:35.620 --> 26:38.540]  where they're giving all that military equipment to the police forces and now
[26:38.540 --> 26:41.740]  this trainee is going to integrate that with police forces they want to work
[26:41.740 --> 26:45.100]  with local law enforcement they want to move outside of government owned
[26:45.100 --> 26:49.220]  facilities and they want to move into the public. We're not supposed to quote
[26:49.220 --> 26:54.700]  counter their Psyop with hey we don't want our military that's absolutely
[26:54.700 --> 26:58.580]  strapped and all over the world and troops having their funding cut and
[26:58.580 --> 27:02.420]  their benefits cut and put on secret death list I love how their operative
[27:02.420 --> 27:07.060]  came out in the tactics when you put out an article and linked to the Indian
[27:07.060 --> 27:09.460]  Apple star saying you know they shouldn't make fun of dead veterans there
[27:09.460 --> 27:13.380]  shouldn't be death list and we get called kooks by their quote veteran core
[27:13.380 --> 27:17.060]  yeah that's the group there to make sure the vets aren't taking care of I mean
[27:17.060 --> 27:20.740]  this is sick this is sick well what do you want to say to your so-called buddy
[27:20.740 --> 27:24.780]  that I understand the Psyop that you're running is not going to work especially
[27:24.780 --> 27:29.060]  here in Texas we're awake we know what's going on and we are going to do
[27:29.060 --> 27:32.940]  everything we can to expose what's going on without a shadow of a doubt it's like
[27:32.940 --> 27:36.940]  the twilight zone they've got Texas listed as hostile they admit their
[27:36.940 --> 27:40.660]  training for a takeover I've got we've got all the documents they admit it's a
[27:40.660 --> 27:45.060]  Psyop in the document it's like saying we're bad because we get a kid out of a
[27:45.060 --> 27:49.060]  burning house or something I I just understand the mindset I mean well it's
[27:49.060 --> 27:52.820]  funny though because he's going well stop you know stop exposing the Psyop

[34:11.980 --> 34:16.540]  us so that nobody fights back when they actually hit the state and if you study
[34:16.540 --> 34:20.180]  it that was done in Panama for about six months before they actually hit him they
[34:20.180 --> 34:24.140]  did constant touch-and-go drills and declassified that was the plan that there
[34:24.140 --> 34:30.220]  was a TV show on history channel about it and narrated by Chuck Heston and I've
[34:30.220 --> 34:34.140]  talked to the military that now listen it doesn't mean this is imminent they've
[34:34.140 --> 34:40.260]  been pushing this for a long time but it's on a scale of 1 to 10 it was about
[34:40.260 --> 34:46.260]  a 1 under Ronald Reagan about a 2 under George Herbert Walker Bush about a 7
[34:46.260 --> 34:51.300]  under Clinton dialed back to about a 5 under George W and then now it's about a
[34:51.300 --> 34:57.340]  9 under Obama I mean they are lined up like the Nazis lined up on the Polish
[34:57.340 --> 35:05.660]  border in 1940 I mean it's not good and again I'm not comparing our military to
[35:05.660 --> 35:09.860]  the Nazis I'm comparing militarily the lining up to what happened in World War
[35:09.860 --> 35:15.100]  2 and they are trying to get the sigh up going testing now it's blown up in
[35:15.100 --> 35:20.340]  Starbucks face and Joe Jennings were to talk to cement he was he lives in
[35:20.340 --> 35:23.220]  North Austin he went into one this morning and they pushed this race
[35:23.220 --> 35:27.420]  together sticker on him and gave him the lecture and told him go to the website
[35:27.420 --> 35:31.740]  to be reeducated you say well that's a small thing that's the start Hillary has
[35:31.740 --> 35:36.220]  come out because all this goes together like a horse and carriage Hillary has
[35:36.220 --> 35:40.540]  come out and said we need fun camps for adults in which people will be forced to
[35:40.540 --> 35:46.140]  talk to each other about politics race the budget you name it that's all NBC
[35:46.140 --> 35:51.380]  news see Americans haven't ever really lived under true totalitarianism so
[35:51.380 --> 35:54.500]  we're we're ignorant we're like Native Americans who've never been around
[35:54.500 --> 35:58.380]  smallpox so you know it killed 90 plus percent of them a European maybe killed
[35:58.380 --> 36:01.860]  2% because everybody was gonna get killed by I'm already had generations before
[36:01.860 --> 36:06.660]  it's kind of like a dodo bird when they get off on you know Easter Island or
[36:06.660 --> 36:10.380]  whatever they were at and the dodo birds are stupid and fat and juicy and don't
[36:10.380 --> 36:13.740]  run away well they were all dead in a couple weeks because the sailors ate
[36:13.740 --> 36:20.500]  them no more dodo birds so we're kind of like dodo birds we were born fighting
[36:20.500 --> 36:26.780]  tyranny 230 something years ago but we forgot about it and compared to other
[36:26.780 --> 36:32.140]  countries we had a lot of liberty and became the apple of the world's eye but
[36:32.140 --> 36:37.100]  we're not ready to deal with it now we we basically are like domesticated deer
[36:37.100 --> 36:41.140]  that just walk around in front of you know the hunters and I'm here telling
[36:41.140 --> 36:48.860]  you from from the Texas experience that's why Texas has this culture Utah
[36:48.860 --> 36:53.460]  has a culture of being born out of rebellion more recently like Texas and
[36:53.460 --> 36:58.060]  being paranoid of the feds and being paranoid of being invaded and taken over
[36:58.060 --> 37:03.340]  because we were always getting invaded by Mexico or invaded by you know other
[37:03.340 --> 37:07.500]  countries or invaded by the feds who wanted it I mean just on and on and
[37:07.500 --> 37:14.740]  and Texas has that that memory and Texas is self-sufficient so is a state like
[37:14.740 --> 37:18.620]  Utah and there's talk in those governments that of the whole country
[37:18.620 --> 37:21.980]  falls into a North American Union they're gonna try to lead a coalition of
[37:21.980 --> 37:27.540]  other states to re-up the Constitution Republic my plan that we've had
[37:27.540 --> 37:31.380]  constitutional lawyers on is basically their plan doesn't mean they adopted my
[37:31.380 --> 37:34.380]  plan it's a common sense plan that we have a right under the Declaration of
[37:34.380 --> 37:37.260]  Independence to abolish or reform the government well we don't have a
[37:37.260 --> 37:40.700]  government it's been hijacked so we kick the hijackers out re-upload the
[37:40.700 --> 37:45.860]  Republic that's my idea for revolution is restoration and I happen to know
[37:45.860 --> 37:48.940]  Drudge Report leaked to it for like five days a few years ago it got picked up in
[37:48.940 --> 37:51.780]  a lot of journals a bunch of constitutional lawyers wrote articles
[37:51.780 --> 37:55.340]  about it and said Mr. Jones's plan comes from the Constitution Bill of Rights
[37:55.340 --> 38:01.820]  and it's the plan we should follow I came up with the plan to have the cities
[38:01.820 --> 38:05.540]  and counties and states pull out of the Patriot Act at least at a moral level
[38:05.540 --> 38:09.900]  doesn't mean I'm a great guy that plan got put out I won the project censored
[38:09.900 --> 38:13.940]  award for the plan and the analysis of the Patriot Act and it got put on
[38:13.940 --> 38:17.900]  national television in 800 plus cities and seven or eight states adopted it
[38:17.900 --> 38:22.740]  that's because ideas are bulletproof folks I'm nobody special I'm just here
[38:22.740 --> 38:28.100]  repeating getting past the baton what people said 240 years ago what people
[38:28.100 --> 38:34.420]  said in 1836 in Texas when David Ayres and William Ayres and my ancestors were
[38:34.420 --> 38:39.300]  here starting the revolution at Washington on the Brazos in East Texas
[38:39.300 --> 38:45.140]  detonating it against the corrupt Santa Anna starting it well now we're not
[38:45.140 --> 38:50.460]  starting it because I am just basically those people continued on we're here
[38:50.460 --> 38:56.340]  trying to restore the Republic and we could use Texas and other states as the
[38:56.340 --> 39:02.380]  political fulcrum or the political center of the wheel to reconstitute the
[39:02.380 --> 39:06.180]  states and just say to the feds we know you're not feds we know your globalist
[39:06.180 --> 39:10.900]  it's out of control we've been maneuvered into bankruptcy and it it just so
[39:10.900 --> 39:16.900]  happens that they've had major confabs at the state level they're fully aware of
[39:16.900 --> 39:20.300]  the plan to collapse the country Texas doesn't want to collapse Texas is
[39:20.300 --> 39:23.900]  developed its own plans to opt out of federal programs they've been saying no
[39:23.900 --> 39:28.700]  to all the carbon taxes and open borders Texas has been quietly securing the
[39:28.700 --> 39:35.060]  border partially Texas is not going along with total federalization the feds
[39:35.060 --> 39:38.660]  are pouring massive amounts of money into Texas more than California who they
[39:38.660 --> 39:42.860]  already captured to federalize every little city they can but they're not
[39:42.860 --> 39:46.940]  getting the counties and the state police I mean folks this is a all-out war
[39:46.940 --> 39:51.380]  you're living in the middle of a 21st century takeover by the corporate board
[39:51.380 --> 39:57.020]  and it was just tuned in feds preparing to invade Texas list state as hostile
[39:57.020 --> 40:00.920]  some participants will be wearing civilian attire and driving civilian
[40:00.920 --> 40:06.540]  vehicles and we have the video Jade Helm is a challenging eight-week joint
[40:06.540 --> 40:11.900]  military and interagency IA unconventional warfare exercise conducted
[40:11.900 --> 40:15.500]  throughout Texas New Mexico Arizona California Nevada Utah Colorado
[40:15.500 --> 40:19.060]  according to classified military document announcing the training drill
[40:19.060 --> 40:23.380]  which runs from July 15th through September 15th so for several months
[40:23.380 --> 40:30.020]  July August September two and a half months multiple branches of the US
[40:30.020 --> 40:33.220]  military including green beret Navy SEALs 82nd Airborne Division this is an
[40:33.220 --> 40:36.540]  invasion training will participate in the eight-week long exercise which may
[40:36.540 --> 40:39.460]  result in increased aircraft in the area at night purpose will be tasked with
[40:39.460 --> 40:43.420]  honing advanced skills in large areas undeveloped land with low population
[40:43.420 --> 40:46.540]  densities and we'll work alongside civilians to gain their trust and
[40:46.540 --> 40:51.060]  understanding of the issues you hear that sigh up for cleaning out the
[40:51.060 --> 40:55.340]  countryside folks get ready the exercise in which some participants will be
[40:55.340 --> 40:58.180]  wearing civilian clothes and driving civilian vehicles list Texas and Utah
[40:58.180 --> 41:05.980]  as hostile territory and they've had cases outside Fort Bragg many times
[41:05.980 --> 41:09.500]  where they are playing the part of hostiles they try to take over a police
[41:09.500 --> 41:11.940]  car and the cop kills them because it was the wrong police car and weren't
[41:11.940 --> 41:16.100]  taking part I mean this could really get bad and of course they're arguing oh we
[41:16.100 --> 41:21.060]  just pick these as the red blue force or the hostile you know friendly force no
[41:21.060 --> 41:26.140]  because if you study deeper into this this is all part of Northcom it's all
[41:26.140 --> 41:31.060]  part of the civilian inmate labor camp program it's all part of the brigade
[41:31.060 --> 41:34.900]  homeland it's all part of the national police stabilization force federal

[43:38.940 --> 43:45.460]  because I was told by military and by police chiefs who came on the show I
[43:45.460 --> 43:52.540]  was 24 years old when I had the Houston police connections in the San Antonio
[43:52.540 --> 43:56.460]  police chief on and Thomas Sanchez they had emergency management in Kingsville
[43:56.460 --> 44:02.060]  and the entire county and and I had former Delta Force people on I had famous
[44:02.060 --> 44:06.620]  Navy SEALs on they were all retiring then and they were all being called in
[44:06.620 --> 44:11.260]  and told about the plan by Clintons people and we held that off and then
[44:11.260 --> 44:15.860]  people are like where's the takeover when we held it back I didn't do
[44:15.860 --> 44:22.220]  anything I was 24 when all this kicked off I was 22 on here 21 but 24 when I
[44:22.220 --> 44:28.740]  was a syndicated show on a few stations a bunch in Texas comparatively and these
[44:28.740 --> 44:31.660]  people knew I knew what I was talking about so I get sent more info more
[44:31.660 --> 44:35.140]  info more info more info that's the only reason I'm an expert because I was
[44:35.140 --> 44:42.900]  told all this by FBI agents police chiefs federal marshals local police you
[44:42.900 --> 44:51.140]  name it that's why I'm an expert because I was told everything by the experts and
[44:51.140 --> 44:54.460]  now they say oh Homeland Security is not for Al Qaeda there for the Tea Party I
[44:54.460 --> 44:59.460]  told you they were gonna flip it on the people now folks know this is happening
[44:59.460 --> 45:05.220]  now but Hillary Clinton has come out and said we need camps for adults info
[45:05.220 --> 45:11.580]  wars.com NBC news people like oh that'll never happen it is happening ladies and
[45:11.580 --> 45:15.900]  gentlemen and it starts with henpecking first the colleges would hand out
[45:15.900 --> 45:19.860]  stickers 20 30 years ago and say be aware of race and I'm reading from the
[45:19.860 --> 45:32.540]  new Starbucks memo that's now public it's now mainstream news race together in
[45:32.540 --> 45:39.340]  social and it goes on to say make people feel responsible to do their part you
[45:39.340 --> 45:43.580]  have guilt do what you're told because you're bad we want to foster empathy and
[45:43.580 --> 45:47.020]  common understanding but only for their agendas we hope to promote awareness and
[45:47.020 --> 45:50.740]  understanding through our efforts with USA Today and other fellow partners and
[45:50.740 --> 45:53.940]  consumers who want to dialogue and share information on the support and issue of
[45:53.940 --> 45:58.540]  the country this is the civilian fighting force just as big and just as strong as
[45:58.540 --> 46:03.220]  our military this is the new recruiting arm of the politically correct henpeckers
[46:03.220 --> 46:07.180]  who will then go out and be spying on all the neighbors under InfraGuard
[46:07.180 --> 46:10.740]  watching England already has this where you get arrested if you're heard
[46:10.740 --> 46:18.780]  making a racial comment in a coffee shop BBC seven years ago this is where they
[46:18.780 --> 46:22.820]  just get us all fighting with each other this is a giant reeducation camp I
[46:22.820 --> 46:26.780]  said that about 20 times yesterday but always said they won't call these FEMA
[46:26.780 --> 46:30.940]  camps they'll call them community camps and you don't have a place to live we
[46:30.940 --> 46:34.340]  got a 200 square foot little cell for you they're building one in downtown Austin
[46:34.340 --> 46:38.460]  there is bar bar around it you do go through a checkpoint at biometrics there
[46:38.460 --> 46:42.500]  will be police on every floor but this is where you live low-income and you work
[46:42.500 --> 46:47.100]  for a factory we have down the street we bus you there but this is your new home
[46:47.100 --> 46:51.820]  and then you if you want to have a job outside of here regular folks have to
[46:51.820 --> 46:56.460]  come to the facility and everyone for tax breaks at first and it's mandatory as
[46:56.460 --> 46:59.300]  part of your new national service that Rahm Emanuel talked about this is all
[46:59.300 --> 47:03.780]  been announced if they get away with it I will be forced everyone we love to go
[47:03.780 --> 47:07.860]  down and sit and be told about your white privilege and then sit there and
[47:07.860 --> 47:12.660]  once your five-year-old be taught about transgender people are like oh that'll
[47:12.660 --> 47:15.940]  never happen I told you yesterday they will start calling for camps and they're
[47:15.940 --> 47:19.700]  gonna and I told you they'd be called love camps or fun camps can find the
[47:19.700 --> 47:24.580]  clips I said the exact words fun camps because it's our well-being everything's
[47:24.580 --> 47:31.860]  inverted here's Hillary we need fun camps to make people go for their
[47:31.860 --> 47:36.180]  community service or credit to learn how they're bad to get it fighting with
[47:36.180 --> 47:39.380]  each other this is mind control this is how you break a country and bring it
[47:39.380 --> 47:51.620]  down let's go to the clip of Hillary and then we will get Joe Jennings I have
[47:51.620 --> 48:07.700]  decided we really need camps for adults
[48:21.740 --> 48:30.820]  also for the rest of us and we reminder my skills from time to time maybe some
[48:30.820 --> 48:36.500]  enrichment certainly some time outdoors maybe actually back up where she says
[48:36.500 --> 48:42.300]  fun camps now notice they said fun deficit Democrats especially want to be
[48:42.300 --> 48:45.140]  taking care of so it's an arrested development thing where the government's
[48:45.140 --> 48:48.380]  their mommy of their daddy and they've said that in studies and so they like
[48:48.380 --> 48:53.740]  her up there lecturing like the grandma about the fun camps and the fun
[48:53.740 --> 48:59.420]  deficits and what we're gonna discuss at these camps and the camps are built
[48:59.420 --> 49:03.420]  but see they're fun there's gonna be concerts at them and they'll be a area
[49:03.420 --> 49:08.180]  to lock up troublemakers and then they'll be in this is how you phase them in
[49:08.180 --> 49:16.180]  you get free showers you get the louse down the road work makes you free we've
[49:16.180 --> 49:21.020]  heard it before Joe Jennings you were in a Starbucks the one in north Austin is
[49:21.020 --> 49:25.540]  by 20 up and down here it is race together to get all hyped up and
[49:25.540 --> 49:30.460]  obsessed on race Joe what do you think of it I thought it's kind of interesting
[49:30.460 --> 49:36.700]  I sometimes frequent Starbucks and everyone there's very nice but today I
[49:36.700 --> 49:43.620]  went through the drive-thru and as I paid for my water and and croissant I was
[49:43.620 --> 49:48.900]  given this sticker and I said what's the sticker and he goes well look at the
[49:48.900 --> 49:54.740]  website and find out what it's all about and it's just the beginning of them
[49:54.740 --> 49:59.220]  knitting and condescending and nudging and pushing like Cass Sunstein others
[49:59.220 --> 50:03.260]  said just pushing us into submission yeah I thought it was horrible race
[50:03.260 --> 50:06.980]  relations just like death education doubled and tripled suicide in schools
[50:06.980 --> 50:12.020]  so it's handed something to make me feel guilty about my white privilege is that
[50:12.020 --> 50:15.860]  what is that what it is yeah and then if you're a quote minority they're the
[50:15.860 --> 50:19.500]  majority in most areas you're like oh your royalty we're so sorry for what

[1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:39.380]  just joined us info wars.com it's drugsreport.com as well the military's
[1:01:39.380 --> 1:01:44.620]  training for occupation of the United States and less Texas and Utah is
[1:01:44.620 --> 1:01:50.180]  hostile areas and they also lists Southern California on the border is
[1:01:50.180 --> 1:01:55.140]  hostile because that's basically controlled by Mexico so Texas is listed
[1:01:55.140 --> 1:01:58.500]  like a foreign country or a foreign occupied area they're trying to retake
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:02.660]  with the 82nd Airborne and the Navy Seals and the Delta Force you can't make
[1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:10.900]  this stuff up I wonder if they'll follow orders I think at first they will
[1:02:10.900 --> 1:02:15.300]  because there'll be a false flag or a string of them to demonize and everybody
[1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:20.420]  will deep down know it's not true but be scared to see they say that moral
[1:02:20.420 --> 1:02:26.420]  courage is is is rarer than physical courage saying no to peer pressure is
[1:02:26.420 --> 1:02:32.420]  one of the hardest things to do but a lot of people who are already out of the
[1:02:32.420 --> 1:02:36.180]  military are going to say no to this and that's why veterans are listed by
[1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:40.220]  Homeland Security is the number one enemy and what Homeland Security is for
[1:02:40.220 --> 1:02:47.700]  no wonder they put a lot of the vets on no treat list no wonder they don't give
[1:02:47.700 --> 1:02:53.180]  you treatment for heart attack or cancer and let you die when you can be helped

[1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:34.940]  radio network
[1:08:34.940 --> 1:08:38.820]  ladies and gentlemen we're live thank you so much for joining us into this
[1:08:38.820 --> 1:08:44.740]  second hour if you just tuned in a feds are preparing to invade Texas list
[1:08:44.740 --> 1:08:49.260]  status hostile some participants will be wearing civilian attire during civilian
[1:08:49.260 --> 1:08:57.020]  activities it's taking place in one two three four five six seven states and out
[1:08:57.020 --> 1:09:06.260]  of those seven states only Texas and Utah are listed as hostile you cannot
[1:09:06.260 --> 1:09:12.980]  make this type of stuff up and that ties in to the fact they say that they're
[1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:17.900]  trying to gain the trust of civilians and understanding of the issues this is
[1:09:17.900 --> 1:09:23.220]  all to condition the public it ties into HR 390 the national emergency centers
[1:09:23.220 --> 1:09:28.780]  establishment act it ties into Hillary Clinton coming out and saying we need to
[1:09:28.780 --> 1:09:32.860]  have reeducation camps I want to play the Rothschild clip in a minute the
[1:09:32.860 --> 1:09:36.780]  green beret that infiltrated the weathermen they were then convicted
[1:09:36.780 --> 1:09:41.300]  and their plan to take over America basically using racial division and
[1:09:41.300 --> 1:09:46.580]  then put tens of millions of Americans in reeducation camps and kill half of
[1:09:46.580 --> 1:09:50.260]  them because Hillary is now talking about that in this Starbucks thing is
[1:09:50.260 --> 1:09:53.900]  the beginning of that handing you race relation stickers to henpeck you and
[1:09:53.900 --> 1:10:00.180]  create all this angst and then the quote minority side in the in the pro
[1:10:00.180 --> 1:10:05.460]  politically correct side of quote whites all joined together this is serious
[1:10:05.460 --> 1:10:10.380]  adjapropped type garbage this is a mid-mitted battle plan Soros has been
[1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:14.900]  caught funding it they're turning up the heat in every major TV show they are
[1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:19.180]  really really coming out to the states in the cities as the feds come in and
[1:10:19.180 --> 1:10:22.460]  demonize local police they want to come in as the saviors we're gonna talk to
[1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:26.700]  John McAfee of course McAfee software and so much more about this in the
[1:10:26.700 --> 1:10:31.180]  waterfront in a moment and his fight for privacy and something new and very
[1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:39.380]  exciting he's launched but let's play that clip of Larry Grafwald and then we
[1:10:39.380 --> 1:10:44.300]  will play the clip again of Hillary saying it's gonna be fun we need fun
[1:10:44.300 --> 1:10:49.780]  camps to make people discuss race and all this garbage so this is their mind
[1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:53.700]  control operations where they tell us what to think what to eat and as Michelle
[1:10:53.700 --> 1:10:58.020]  Obama said not to be bossy cuz she's not bossy being bossy let's go ahead and
[1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:04.620]  go to that clip and they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded
[1:11:04.620 --> 1:11:12.180]  against by creating and establishing reeducation centers in the Southwest where
[1:11:12.180 --> 1:11:16.420]  we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the new way of
[1:11:16.420 --> 1:11:23.460]  thinking and teach them how things were going to be I ask well what is going to
[1:11:23.460 --> 1:11:28.340]  happen to those people that we can't reeducate that are die-hard cap capitalists
[1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:34.780]  and the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated and when I pursued this
[1:11:34.780 --> 1:11:39.900]  further they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in
[1:11:39.900 --> 1:11:46.020]  these reeducation centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people
[1:11:46.020 --> 1:11:52.980]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have
[1:11:52.980 --> 1:12:01.700]  graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and
[1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:08.620]  hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and
[1:12:08.620 --> 1:12:14.220]  they were dead serious from 1982 the documentary no place to hide Larry
[1:12:14.220 --> 1:12:18.980]  Grathwald a great patriot died last year frequent guests on the show notice they
[1:12:18.980 --> 1:12:22.460]  say for the reeducation of Texas in Utah when they're taken down this is just a
[1:12:22.460 --> 1:12:28.020]  training mission for that the Joint Forces New Mexico's the central base the
[1:12:28.020 --> 1:12:33.500]  Southwest where we'll be reeducated right there in the official documents net
[1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:42.580]  cute it's their common base says right here hmm so there you go they take I
[1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:46.700]  guess they round us up bring us to the sub bases fly us into these bases they'll
[1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:50.780]  be practicing drilling that practice and taking over the capital practice
[1:12:50.780 --> 1:12:54.420]  hunting down ranchers and farmers they admit that's all in the drills then
[1:12:54.420 --> 1:12:58.100]  they'll for the media have some Iraq or Afghanistan training for the public and
[1:12:58.100 --> 1:13:01.260]  they admit it's all a Psyop to win our hearts and minds the condition is for
[1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:08.220]  occupation we are joined by John McAfee and he's gonna launch a big new
[1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:11.780]  privacy push here today we're very exciting about that who is McAfee dot
[1:13:11.780 --> 1:13:16.380]  com a future tense central dot com and we'll talk to him about his new
[1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:19.860]  platform and program but I want to pick his brain you know he gets demonized in
[1:13:19.860 --> 1:13:23.900]  media because he's an eccentric fellow sold his company for hundreds of
[1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:26.780]  millions of dollars moved out of Belize said that he was run out of the
[1:13:26.780 --> 1:13:30.780]  country by terrorists but people connected to Islamists turned out after
[1:13:30.780 --> 1:13:34.580]  a year after he left that did come out mainstream news he successfully evaded
[1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:38.940]  the authorities got into Guatemala I've talked to people that still think he's
[1:13:38.940 --> 1:13:42.740]  in jail or something never was he was able to hack into government computers
[1:13:42.740 --> 1:13:46.900]  record them involved in this stuff he's quite the survivor quite the adventure
[1:13:46.900 --> 1:13:52.380]  and John McAfee joins us here on the global transmission John you heard me
[1:13:52.380 --> 1:13:58.940]  just get into the preparation for the collapse in Utah and Texas targeted for
[1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:06.340]  Northcom takeover by Southcom what do you make of all this you know I think I
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:11.900]  think the world is going to hell in the hand basket and in a number of ways
[1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:19.580]  Alex the the problem stems from a removal of our basic freedoms our
[1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:25.980]  liberties our privacies we we have you know we have people telling us how to
[1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:32.380]  think what to say what to believe we have people watching what we say we have
[1:14:32.380 --> 1:14:36.180]  people watching what we do I pretty soon will have people watching what we
[1:14:36.180 --> 1:14:44.220]  think it's it's it's a tragic state of affairs and nothing nothing in the news
[1:14:44.220 --> 1:14:51.180]  that I've seen in the past month has elevated me it is all depressed me well
[1:14:51.180 --> 1:14:55.260]  I agree with you and we've got open NSA spying illegally we've got Congress
[1:14:55.260 --> 1:14:59.220]  openly being blackmailed we've got the borders ordered completely wide open
[1:14:59.220 --> 1:15:04.460]  outside of law I mean we have become a tyranny my only question is where are we
[1:15:04.460 --> 1:15:10.700]  going next I think the bottom has fallen out so now how deep is this chasm I
[1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:16.660]  think that the chasm is far deeper than we thought if you remember one year ago
[1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:22.020]  almost to the day I was on your on your show railing about a company called
[1:15:22.020 --> 1:15:27.740]  Harris Corporation and a device that they created called a stingray and how
[1:15:27.740 --> 1:15:34.420]  they had created a contract that would not allow the purchaser of one of these
[1:15:34.420 --> 1:15:39.180]  devices to defaults to anyone that they owned it in other words you could not
[1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:45.300]  defaults the name of the device the name right sure anything and I'm going this
[1:15:45.300 --> 1:15:50.300]  is insane it's utterly insane the reason for it of course is Harris court does
[1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:54.700]  not want the world to know how many of these devices are out there because I'm
[1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:59.980]  afraid to send the millions and these devices are used ostensibly to catch
[1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:06.540]  terrorists or criminals doing nefarious things investigators without warrants
[1:16:06.540 --> 1:16:10.140]  sit there and listen to your phone calls everything it's unbelievable but the
[1:16:10.140 --> 1:16:13.860]  prime is a problem Alex it's not just listening to the phone call of the
[1:16:13.860 --> 1:16:18.420]  target it's listening to everybody's phone call within a quarter mile radius
[1:16:18.420 --> 1:16:23.500]  of where this device is located because they're all connecting up to you now the
[1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:28.660]  the police and the FBI and the authorities say but we're not we're not
[1:16:28.660 --> 1:16:32.180]  caring about that we're filtering out all of that well how do you filter it out
[1:16:32.180 --> 1:16:35.940]  unless you listen to it think about it I mean you're looking for one
[1:16:35.940 --> 1:16:39.660]  conversation and let's remember just six months ago when you and others were
[1:16:39.660 --> 1:16:42.260]  beating the drum and we were beating the drum to expose it we exposed other big
[1:16:42.260 --> 1:16:45.940]  secret networks came national news in Seattle in other areas the Homeland
[1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:50.980]  Security was putting in you know not just local police they came out and said
[1:16:50.980 --> 1:16:55.140]  those aren't ours we don't know who they are they lied to the public the FBI did
[1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:59.900]  so there's also that I mean this is illegal of course it's illegal I think
[1:16:59.900 --> 1:17:06.100]  the contract itself is illegal because it violates our freedom of access to
[1:17:06.100 --> 1:17:10.700]  public information and we have we have a law passed by Congress that gives us
[1:17:10.700 --> 1:17:15.700]  the right to find out what the hell our government is doing our local government
[1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:19.500]  our state and now Obama announced three days ago they will no longer honor for
[1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:25.140]  a request period at the White House outside of law so so is it a bottomless
[1:17:25.140 --> 1:17:30.540]  chasm I mean how deep is it well I think I think it's it's it's show some some
[1:17:30.540 --> 1:17:34.700]  degree of indifference of stupidity on the part of the average American Alex
[1:17:34.700 --> 1:17:38.980]  listen here's how it finally came to light now I came I talked about it two
[1:17:38.980 --> 1:17:44.180]  years ago and said this is gonna be a problem this is insane it has to be
[1:17:44.180 --> 1:17:49.260]  addressed and looked at so finally it takes it takes something dramatic for
[1:17:49.260 --> 1:17:54.540]  anyone to ever take notice the sheriff for Santa Clara County a woman put in
[1:17:54.540 --> 1:17:59.420]  for a request for a half a million dollars for these machines that were
[1:17:59.420 --> 1:18:07.380]  able to tap telephones of bad people so the this is the first time that they
[1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:12.180]  they had done a referendum to get public money without the warrant for this
[1:18:12.180 --> 1:18:15.540]  there the public started asking questions like well what is it well we
[1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:20.180]  can't tell you what it is but what does it do we can't tell you what it does can
[1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:25.260]  we see a demonstration no you can't can you tell us the name of the product no
[1:18:25.260 --> 1:18:31.220]  we cannot tell you tell her can you tell us who made it no we can't do you see
[1:18:31.220 --> 1:18:35.060]  the insanity this is actually happening in America in Santa Clara
[1:18:35.060 --> 1:18:40.420]  California as we speak and probably in thousands of other cities across this
[1:18:40.420 --> 1:18:45.060]  country because all the police all the FBI all the agencies they want these
[1:18:45.060 --> 1:18:50.700]  stingray devices because they allow you to listen to anyone's telephone
[1:18:50.700 --> 1:18:56.020]  conversations and to plant software in those telephones that will monitor your
[1:18:56.020 --> 1:19:01.100]  every word view everything that you do while you're showering while you're in
[1:19:01.100 --> 1:19:07.780]  the bathroom your codes I'm sorry get your other past codes and imagine this
[1:19:07.780 --> 1:19:12.380]  is all being done illegally without a warrant just in our face that's correct
[1:19:12.380 --> 1:19:16.940]  that it that's absolutely correct judges do not even understand what what they
[1:19:16.940 --> 1:19:24.700]  say when we're going to use our our unnameable device to to to to listen to
[1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:28.460]  this man's conversation what it really does is it listens to everyone's
[1:19:28.460 --> 1:19:34.060]  conversation within the pickup radius of that mobile get intercepts it and
[1:19:34.060 --> 1:19:42.780]  he scrambles it it steals it stay there your skype's breaking up a bit John

[1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:23.140]  why was Obama cutting funding to veterans groups he called him Barry
[1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:27.740]  Kenyan sitaro you know pointing out that he might have been born in Kenya and
[1:24:27.740 --> 1:24:31.900]  Newsweek you name it called him racist but Obama made the same joke the week
[1:24:31.900 --> 1:24:37.500]  before at a press dinner saying well I'm from Kenya and I moved here because I
[1:24:37.500 --> 1:24:43.740]  love America so much so again they know it's not racist it's their
[1:24:43.740 --> 1:24:47.820]  political weapon to bully people into submission and while all of our rights
[1:24:47.820 --> 1:24:51.460]  are being stolen while we're being signed on to tens of trillions more in fake
[1:24:51.460 --> 1:24:55.940]  derivatives of foreign banks while our basic freedoms are being dismantled
[1:24:55.940 --> 1:24:59.660]  they're obsessing on race I want to get into your ways of countering this in the
[1:24:59.660 --> 1:25:04.540]  next longer segment John McAfee who joins us from who is McAfee dot com but
[1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:08.860]  what do you make of the obsessing on race suddenly and George Soros caught
[1:25:08.860 --> 1:25:12.380]  funding thirty plus million dollars to stir up demonstrations against the
[1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:16.900]  police I mean I know we're both against the police being organs of tyranny but
[1:25:16.900 --> 1:25:20.980]  we I mean I know I understand they're trying to cause Balkanization what do
[1:25:20.980 --> 1:25:30.220]  you think's going on here well as you as you know Alex my wife is black and I
[1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:36.860]  am extremely familiar with all of the the racial issues involved with with
[1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:42.980]  both white black people and others you know I think I think we are beyond
[1:25:42.980 --> 1:25:50.340]  needing the government to be involved in in in our opinions and attitudes toward
[1:25:50.340 --> 1:25:55.260]  race just like we we do not need the government involved in our opinions and
[1:25:55.260 --> 1:26:03.660]  attitude toward church belief political affiliation spiritual aspirations or
[1:26:03.660 --> 1:26:10.100]  anything else exactly so so this is the fundamental problem the government
[1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:15.660]  just the real problem is this the government wants to be our parents our
[1:26:15.660 --> 1:26:21.540]  father yeah arm they want they want to take care of us like you would take
[1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:27.100]  care of a wayward child homeland securities promised us after 9-11 we
[1:26:27.100 --> 1:26:31.980]  would be secure all we had to do was give up a whole bunch of freedoms and we
[1:26:31.980 --> 1:26:37.460]  would be secure people bought into that how secure are we far less now than we
[1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:42.420]  were before and we have given up a great deal of freedom and a great deal of
[1:26:42.420 --> 1:26:47.860]  privacy for this illusion of security there is no such thing as security and
[1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:53.460]  at least not provided by the government how can they provide security for me if
[1:26:53.460 --> 1:26:58.100]  a burglar breaks into my house is there a magic button to life and push that will
[1:26:58.100 --> 1:27:03.660]  make the police materialize instantly between myself and the and the burglar
[1:27:03.660 --> 1:27:09.860]  no the police do not prevent crimes they are there after the fact to help solve
[1:27:09.860 --> 1:27:13.740]  and then they don't know who's who when they come into a situation and make a
[1:27:13.740 --> 1:27:16.660]  lot of mistakes we're not even blaming them it's just that they're not even a
[1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:21.580]  panacea when there is a cop there well I just don't think that anybody can take
[1:27:21.580 --> 1:27:25.700]  responsibility for your own security other than yourself Alex you have to do
[1:27:25.700 --> 1:27:30.340]  you have to when when you buy a house do you call the department of the interior
[1:27:30.340 --> 1:27:35.140]  and say please install my locks no that's your job yeah exactly I mean you
[1:27:35.140 --> 1:27:38.540]  call the government say give me free insurance but that's the mindset they're
[1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:45.620]  selling well of course that because that that buys votes does it I mean think
[1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:48.300]  about it you you have someone saying we're gonna give you everything we're
[1:27:48.300 --> 1:27:51.580]  gonna protect you we're gonna we're gonna me keep you safe we're gonna keep
[1:27:51.580 --> 1:27:58.340]  you healthy all you got to do is is give up control to us because we know better
[1:27:58.340 --> 1:28:02.180]  you're a famous engineer a famous entrepreneur a famous programmer worked
[1:28:02.180 --> 1:28:07.180]  in NASA and secret programs you've been around the block you had that famous
[1:28:07.180 --> 1:28:11.580]  escape from a police were vindicated there that they were involved in serious
[1:28:11.580 --> 1:28:17.060]  criminal operations clearly where do you see it all going I mean do you have hope
[1:28:17.060 --> 1:28:22.780]  for humanity where do you see it all ending I think the first thing Alex is
[1:28:22.780 --> 1:28:27.860]  we have to take responsibility for our own actions our own thoughts our own
[1:28:27.860 --> 1:28:32.340]  feelings this is not happening in America anymore what we want is other
[1:28:32.340 --> 1:28:39.580]  people our boss our landlord our wife our our spouse the state the county the
[1:28:39.580 --> 1:28:45.060]  city the federal government to take care of us and make our decisions for us
[1:28:45.060 --> 1:28:52.140]  this is the tragedy that exists today this cannot continue you cannot live a
[1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:59.700]  free meaningful existence if you abdicate responsibility for yourself and
[1:28:59.700 --> 1:29:04.100]  we have done that we've done that because we're lazy we we have our we have

[1:37:28.620 --> 1:37:31.740]  that they have all these back doors built in lets criminal hackers and
[1:37:31.740 --> 1:37:37.060]  criminal groups go into data breaches everywhere at Target your personal
[1:37:37.060 --> 1:37:39.740]  computers you name it so this is something everybody should be doing
[1:37:39.740 --> 1:37:48.540]  John McAfee yeah I my main company future 10 central builds applications for
[1:37:48.540 --> 1:37:55.140]  privacy and security on a very rigid basis we have a product called
[1:37:55.140 --> 1:38:00.180]  divisive that will lock down your camera your microphone your Bluetooth your
[1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:05.860]  Wi-Fi whatever you like so that even if one of these stingray devices is coming
[1:38:05.860 --> 1:38:10.540]  by they can't at least see you and hear what you're saying if you're if you're
[1:38:10.540 --> 1:38:18.060]  not using the phone for communication but but my biggest my biggest passion now
[1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:26.500]  is is we turn our privacy to us it's give us back our privacy campaign because
[1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:32.700]  we have not we have none at all if you made amazing animated videos TV ads I
[1:38:32.700 --> 1:38:37.580]  mean you've really been fighting hard I have I have and I've been I've been
[1:38:37.580 --> 1:38:43.860]  severely thrashed by it by the by the government the the NSA in particular
[1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:52.060]  does not like anybody you know saying what they're doing may be wrong you know
[1:38:52.060 --> 1:39:00.100]  I have I have IRS audits I have you name name the harassment that can happen to
[1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:05.820]  someone and and it's happening to me now but but I'm not stopping it's something
[1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:13.340]  that you know I have something I truly believe in and something that we if we
[1:39:13.340 --> 1:39:18.500]  lose our privacy Alex we lose everything we lose we we lose our
[1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:24.980]  humanity and so you know and we're asking for help because number one I want
[1:39:24.980 --> 1:39:29.380]  to know how many of these stingray devices Harris corporation has sold I
[1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:34.220]  guarantee we're sending the millions and each one of these devices let me again
[1:39:34.220 --> 1:39:37.980]  let me reach I was about to say they're not that much if one county bought half
[1:39:37.980 --> 1:39:42.980]  a million dollars worth that's a ton of them that's right so for example just
[1:39:42.980 --> 1:39:47.460]  fit the just Simeon the county supervisor said to the sheriff we are
[1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:51.580]  being asked to spend five hundred thousand dollars of taxpayer money and
[1:39:51.580 --> 1:39:57.220]  forty two thousand dollars a year thereafter for a product the name brand
[1:39:57.220 --> 1:40:02.780]  of which we're not sure of the maker you cannot tell us a product we have not
[1:40:02.780 --> 1:40:09.260]  seen and a strong demonstration we cannot look at as a precondition and
[1:40:09.260 --> 1:40:14.500]  and it's and it's like do you see the insanity of this and yet the police
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:17.940]  departments and FBI and government agencies all over are buying these
[1:40:17.940 --> 1:40:23.940]  because they create ultimate power because they collect the ultimate data
[1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:35.260]  one of the for example here's another thing the that's it okay what as a
[1:40:35.260 --> 1:40:40.060]  bonus particularly concerned about stingray is that the technology on unlike
[1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:46.340]  other phone surveillance methods also scans all the cell phones in the area
[1:40:46.340 --> 1:40:52.620]  where it is being used not just the target it's scanning the area and so
[1:40:52.620 --> 1:40:55.540]  what's the what is the government doing with that information well I mean that's
[1:40:55.540 --> 1:40:58.420]  what Google got in trouble with with their Google cars stealing people's
[1:40:58.420 --> 1:41:03.380]  passwords this is criminal black hat hacking they're committing felonies
[1:41:03.380 --> 1:41:07.340]  every milliseconds with these of course they want to keep it secret because then
[1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:11.740]  that'll kill the market for these things of course and and they're making a
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:15.060]  fortune on these things it's a multi-billion dollar company and one of
[1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:20.460]  the prime defense contractors they allegedly only sells the law enforcement
[1:41:20.460 --> 1:41:24.780]  agencies which you know for fact that if the police have something the bad guys
[1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:27.740]  have the same thing and they've taken the part and look at it and they know
[1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:32.780]  what it is there's no way to keep this away from the the hands are trying to
[1:41:32.780 --> 1:41:38.100]  keep it away from but well what they are doing is ensuring that all of us are
[1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:45.260]  constantly being monitored listen to watch and recorded it's good they record
[1:41:45.260 --> 1:41:50.900]  this stuff because they pour through it later to to not use the things they do
[1:41:50.900 --> 1:41:54.340]  not want for example what you're your tail you might be saying to your
[1:41:54.340 --> 1:41:59.180]  neighbor while the guy across the street is the bad guy being listened to this
[1:41:59.180 --> 1:42:03.540]  is a tragedy of the highest order and it's it's like frightening that that
[1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:07.700]  people aren't up in the arms going I'm not going to take this anymore I'm mad
[1:42:07.700 --> 1:42:12.260]  as hell I'm not taking it anymore but we have to stop this we have to but it's
[1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:15.740]  such a nice Trojan horse I mean they gave it to us free we should take it in
[1:42:15.740 --> 1:42:19.220]  at night and I'm sure it'll be very friendly when the soldiers come out with
[1:42:19.220 --> 1:42:24.660]  swords I mean that's what's happening here is a brazen to arrogant attempt to
[1:42:24.660 --> 1:42:28.940]  wire the world for surveillance and control I'm not worried about a robo
[1:42:28.940 --> 1:42:33.020]  apocalypse AI taking over I think down the road that could happen I'm worried
[1:42:33.020 --> 1:42:37.460]  about the fact that already all the appliances that are coming out that are
[1:42:37.460 --> 1:42:42.500]  quote smart Samsung droid iPhone they all put their terms and conditions hey
[1:42:42.500 --> 1:42:46.340]  we're recording your voice and turning the camera on for marketing and giving
[1:42:46.340 --> 1:42:51.420]  it to even outside parties so quote Samsung watch what you say I mean
[1:42:51.420 --> 1:42:56.740]  imagine in America hey you just bought a $3,000 Samsung smart TV you know if you
[1:42:56.740 --> 1:43:02.660]  read the 50 pages of stuff watch what you say Mac I mean it's just over the
[1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:09.740]  top well not just that I work with a gentleman who works who just left a
[1:43:09.740 --> 1:43:15.500]  company that does face recognition software and expression recognition
[1:43:15.500 --> 1:43:20.980]  software they have a contract with Samsung to watch you while you're
[1:43:20.980 --> 1:43:26.460]  watching TV and note when you're smiling or laughing at a joke I mean you're not
[1:43:26.460 --> 1:43:31.260]  laughing at a joke note when you feel you're looking different or bored think
[1:43:31.260 --> 1:43:36.780]  about this think about this they are watching every single thing they do and
[1:43:36.780 --> 1:43:40.780]  they want us by the way the Samsung in the contract says please if you want to
[1:43:40.780 --> 1:43:44.980]  do a private conversation don't do it in front of our television because it will
[1:43:44.980 --> 1:43:49.660]  be recorded and sent to a third and nameless third party we're putting up
[1:43:49.660 --> 1:43:53.860]  with this shit Alex we are putting up with this something is wrong with us as
[1:43:53.860 --> 1:43:59.980]  a people something is terribly wrong I'm asking for people to volunteer in every

[1:45:33.860 --> 1:45:37.980]  of the Democrats the majority of them she talked to here in Austin yesterday and
[1:45:37.980 --> 1:45:42.860]  South by Southwest want Lord Obama to run for a third term let's go ahead and
[1:45:42.860 --> 1:45:46.620]  play this report from last night's info wars nightly news we'll come back from
[1:45:46.620 --> 1:45:51.700]  break and get into more news stay with us
[1:45:51.700 --> 1:45:55.500]  Hillary has kind of been doing such a bad job the Democrats don't really have
[1:45:55.500 --> 1:46:00.900]  anybody and Obama is toying with the idea of running for a third term we want to
[1:46:00.900 --> 1:46:05.460]  put out a video that tells him to do it already voted for you last year so I
[1:46:05.460 --> 1:46:09.980]  will for you again next time too or not last year but last term Obama you
[1:46:09.980 --> 1:46:17.340]  should run for a third term because we need you are you guys lining up to vote
[1:46:17.340 --> 1:46:23.060]  for Obama's third term that way everyone's here in line we need Obama to
[1:46:23.060 --> 1:46:28.380]  run for the third term so I want the whole country to vote for Obama are you
[1:46:28.380 --> 1:46:34.260]  here voting for Obama's third term yes I honestly think why not Obama's the
[1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:36.740]  first black president why might be the first person in history to go through
[1:46:36.740 --> 1:46:42.340]  terms I don't go about Obama I think Obama is gonna give it a shot but it's
[1:46:42.340 --> 1:46:45.340]  still pretty important he's not gonna get this one
[1:46:45.340 --> 1:46:53.740]  Obama to run for a third term I don't hate it it sounds all right
[1:46:53.740 --> 1:46:58.780]  America so that's all that matters well if you love America then you know the
[1:46:58.780 --> 1:47:03.380]  Constitution has a 22nd Amendment and he can't run for a third term even though he
[1:47:03.380 --> 1:47:07.100]  wants to I don't care but I didn't know he wanted to run I'd say he did a good
[1:47:07.100 --> 1:47:12.500]  job but I just don't think we have a president in alphas you know if we were
[1:47:12.500 --> 1:47:17.540]  to limit to like four terms that wouldn't be too bad third term make it
[1:47:17.540 --> 1:47:23.500]  happen boom boom Obama run for a third term we really don't want to use I think
[1:47:23.500 --> 1:47:32.780]  you can make it happen yes I don't think it's an option so I think we're okay
[1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:40.780]  for the kids no I do not want that man for a third term our government can go
[1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:45.020]  ahead and burn itself down before I do for Hillary I have owned for any of them
[1:47:45.020 --> 1:47:54.140]  that woman don't need to run either but you can only do two terms we just got
[1:47:54.140 --> 1:48:01.620]  to do away with that pesky 22nd Amendment don't think so sorry I'm pro
[1:48:01.620 --> 1:48:06.380]  America there's a reason that Hillary Clinton is not up in charge of the
[1:48:06.380 --> 1:48:10.580]  United States he has signed a lot of executive orders and this is something
[1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:13.500]  that he thinks that it could be fun to kind of mess around with the
[1:48:13.500 --> 1:48:17.660]  amendments and people want him to run for a third term the Democrats have no
[1:48:17.660 --> 1:48:22.580]  one that may be the case but you know the Constitution's got to work if you
[1:48:22.580 --> 1:48:26.740]  don't vote for Obama for a third term you're voting for Bush or Hillary so well
[1:48:26.740 --> 1:48:32.380]  like us like a dinner bush oh baby brother looks like a triple lose

[1:54:15.860 --> 1:54:19.660]  powerful reports that's why I'm airing them. Arm black Milligan's prep for war
[1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:24.820]  Jakari Jackson and Kit Daniels video it has pretty good audio but it's hidden
[1:54:24.820 --> 1:54:28.700]  camera so it's not good for radio it's not might not translate well on AM radio
[1:54:28.700 --> 1:54:33.100]  but it's very powerful it's linked on drugsreport.com and infowars.com an
[1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:37.060]  inside investigation of the brainwashing and social engineering a
[1:54:37.060 --> 1:54:41.580]  reeducation camp stuff going on at Starbucks that that's what that is see
[1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:45.020]  when you study history it's giant reeducation camp stuff that's why
[1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:47.620]  Hillary came out and said we need reeducation camps and talked to the
[1:54:47.620 --> 1:54:51.660]  audience like they were five years old that's what this is all about that sounds
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:54.740]  weird you hear me say it because you never lived in a reeducation camp when
[1:54:54.740 --> 1:54:58.460]  you've studied them you know exactly what it is so that's coming up I want to
[1:54:58.460 --> 1:55:03.540]  go to this piece by Darren McBreen exposing the phony drug war it's the
[1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:11.540]  title of it is Chewbacca Smokes weed here it is it's stimulating mind
[1:55:11.540 --> 1:55:18.900]  expanding safer to use that alcohol it's the end thing such are the myths
[1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:24.300]  concerning marijuana myths that lull thousands of young people into
[1:55:24.300 --> 1:55:31.420]  experimenting with a much as weed the burning weed with its roots in hell
[1:55:31.420 --> 1:55:35.980]  should marijuana be legalized we'll debate the pros and cons right now
[1:55:35.980 --> 1:55:40.220]  marijuana leads to doing worse things that's just a fact I don't care what
[1:55:40.220 --> 1:55:44.500]  anybody says a drug war is a total failure and the federal drug war ought
[1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:49.220]  to be re revisited and for the most part gotten rid of this has corrupted our
[1:55:49.220 --> 1:55:53.340]  government it has destroyed our due process and it is withholding from
[1:55:53.340 --> 1:55:57.420]  people medicine that is very effective and we need to stop it we need to roll
[1:55:57.420 --> 1:56:01.380]  provision back right now marijuana is natural you know there's so many
[1:56:01.380 --> 1:56:05.660]  different things that you can use it for including you know helping cancer
[1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:09.820]  patients I'm a Christian minister yeah and I believe you know Jesus will be
[1:56:09.820 --> 1:56:13.460]  okay with it there have been studies proven that children who have 400
[1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:17.100]  seizures a day that's intense it's like it's like a seizure a minute who can't
[1:56:17.100 --> 1:56:20.580]  stop just finally convulsing have been helped and have stopped having seizures
[1:56:20.580 --> 1:56:25.220]  up like two to three days after applying the cannabinoid oil treatment to
[1:56:25.220 --> 1:56:27.860]  themselves like in their food or something like that like that's
[1:56:27.860 --> 1:56:32.180]  incredible there's proof of that like it's all over the internet the mandatory
[1:56:32.180 --> 1:56:36.980]  minimums locking people up for nonviolent crimes for very long periods of time
[1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:40.500]  where there's no discretion for the fact that they were nonviolent that this is
[1:56:40.500 --> 1:56:46.620]  their first offense no just lock them up making life miserable for innocent
[1:56:46.620 --> 1:56:50.540]  children but I should go out and help real criminals they got a tip on this drag
[1:56:50.540 --> 1:56:54.940]  race when we find the marijuana well sir that's a very serious charge think
[1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:59.700]  about the tens of billions of dollars that big pharma makes a year with close
[1:56:59.700 --> 1:57:05.500]  to 20% of the population being on anti-depressants when every major study
[1:57:05.500 --> 1:57:13.540]  shows that marijuana absolutely destroys depression in people and Prozac can't
[1:57:13.540 --> 1:57:17.700]  even prove that it has any measurable positive effect and they have to put on
[1:57:17.700 --> 1:57:22.540]  the insert that it may make you commit suicide things like alcohol kill people
[1:57:22.540 --> 1:57:29.580]  daily and it's legal because it can be taxed happy to deliver alcohol but weed
[1:57:29.580 --> 1:57:32.020]  is illegal right
[1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:42.900]  I do think that however that the pharmaceutical company should stay away
[1:57:42.900 --> 1:57:46.940]  why just keep it natural let's have the sun out you know like gross disease in
[1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:50.620]  the dirt you know like to stay away you know what it means you know like let it
[1:57:50.620 --> 1:57:53.500]  grow organically and like that's that's what will help people it should
[1:57:53.500 --> 1:57:57.180]  definitely should not be legal because that's helping us make money on the
[1:57:57.180 --> 1:58:01.540]  streets and probation that's right peace what's the obstacle what what the hell
[1:58:01.540 --> 1:58:04.860]  is stopping it what what why is Texas taking so long because we're in Texas
[1:58:04.860 --> 1:58:09.540]  do you know how to make money off of yet they're looking at all the benefits
[1:58:09.540 --> 1:58:14.140]  right-wing they they don't care about the health benefits they know that we're
[1:58:14.140 --> 1:58:17.660]  making so much money off the cancer and whatnot they want us to be unhealthy there's
[1:58:17.660 --> 1:58:20.740]  so many benefits for something that's not folks we need to look more into a
[1:58:20.740 --> 1:58:24.460]  natural it's a good report the whole things on info wars dot com and he
[1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:28.780]  photoshopped him in a real Chewbacca smoking pot in front of the cops yeah
[1:58:28.780 --> 1:58:30.980]  yeah I don't like the whole marijuana culture but it does have a lot of
[1:58:30.980 --> 1:58:34.940]  medical benefits they keep it illegal so they can throw people in prison we didn't
[1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:40.940]  prohibition now everybody basically agrees on that we'll be back thank you

[2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:56.620]  duty or veterans on this especially first-time callers folks 800-2599-231
[2:00:56.620 --> 2:01:00.820]  on that topic for two segments then dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us it's a
[2:01:00.820 --> 2:01:04.780]  seven-minute report it's on info wars calm I want to air about five minutes of
[2:01:04.780 --> 2:01:09.460]  it right now armed black militants prep for war group chanting various anti
[2:01:09.460 --> 2:01:13.220]  police slogans including oink oink bang bang then they claim they're an open
[2:01:13.220 --> 2:01:17.500]  carry group well fine I'm all for open carry to condition folks the Second
[2:01:17.500 --> 2:01:21.580]  Amendment say okay that's our own Psyop but not to make it about killing the
[2:01:21.580 --> 2:01:25.460]  cops and you see these poor police out there the ones we talked to definitely
[2:01:25.460 --> 2:01:28.660]  I mean you imagine just walking up shooting one of them in the head for no
[2:01:28.660 --> 2:01:33.300]  reason I mean this is just ridiculous and it's all what George Soros loves to
[2:01:33.300 --> 2:01:37.460]  push more division here's part of the report
[2:01:37.460 --> 2:01:51.660]  Leanne McAdder reporting for info wars calm I'm out here at South by Southwest
[2:01:51.660 --> 2:01:55.940]  and we just saw some tweets on Twitter people were saying that the Black
[2:01:55.940 --> 2:02:00.780]  Panthers are out here doing an open carry march so obviously we got to go
[2:02:00.780 --> 2:02:04.300]  try and find these guys and of course see what the people out here at South by
[2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:32.300]  Southwest think about a bunch of guns in their face
[2:02:32.300 --> 2:02:55.340]  please tell us your manifesto so essentially what we're doing here this
[2:02:55.340 --> 2:02:59.140]  is the Huey P. Newton gun club and we're just demonstrating number one our gun
[2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:02.340]  rights and number two we take a position against police brutality which we
[2:03:02.340 --> 2:03:06.220]  say is the euphemism for police terrorism okay so what do you want to say to
[2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:09.780]  people who think that open carry and things like this is promoting violence
[2:03:09.780 --> 2:03:14.580]  it's nothing violent about bearing arms just anything doing violent fact over
[2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:19.700]  99% of America bears arms and so that's not anything violent much not exactly
[2:03:19.700 --> 2:03:22.700]  we're telling people that they do have rights there's nothing about this is not
[2:03:22.700 --> 2:03:27.740]  open carry you're saying right they do cops and what's the response from all
[2:03:27.740 --> 2:03:31.500]  the people out here probably a global audience seeing witnessing this
[2:03:31.500 --> 2:03:35.620]  happening which is incredible what's been the response essentially the people
[2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:39.660]  have been very supportive we've been allowed to educate the people I mean so
[2:03:39.660 --> 2:03:43.180]  that's our first and foremost position to make sure people understand what why
[2:03:43.180 --> 2:03:46.420]  we know what we're doing and today's demonstration was all about dealing with
[2:03:46.420 --> 2:03:49.340]  the issues about police brutality which we says you can measure for police
[2:03:49.340 --> 2:04:02.980]  terrorism a guarantee of the feds are running this group a lot of people mean
[2:04:02.980 --> 2:04:07.340]  well but just taught to obsess over stuff that happened hundreds of years ago
[2:04:07.340 --> 2:04:12.780]  and everybody has some pressure in their past he got hit in the head in
[2:04:12.780 --> 2:04:20.420]  Africa I mean I've had racist black people attack me grown up Dallas I don't blame all black people
[2:04:29.660 --> 2:04:33.220]  the cracker does it all yeah right why don't you protest against the problem
[2:04:33.220 --> 2:04:36.220]  half of blacks getting the board we haven't we haven't joined open carry
[2:04:36.220 --> 2:04:40.900]  Texas and the primary issue is primarily dealing with gun rights whereas our
[2:04:40.900 --> 2:04:46.100]  issue is a little bit different we're we'll take I think we favor some gun
[2:04:46.100 --> 2:04:49.180]  rights we do have some connections with that but our primary position against
[2:04:49.180 --> 2:04:53.380]  police brutality fractured side is the issue that exists all right folks we'll
[2:04:53.380 --> 2:04:57.340]  be back stay with us we'll take your phone calls on the other side I'm on

[2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:46.620]  they're being put to the process of being turned into basically global
[2:08:46.620 --> 2:08:52.460]  astuages and they also have to deal with the mainstream media basically using
[2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:57.380]  them for cat and fodder and demonizing them and taking things out of context
[2:08:57.380 --> 2:09:01.340]  while at the same time claiming that they support them that's only meant to
[2:09:01.340 --> 2:09:05.860]  put the police into their own little cult and then the feds can come in and
[2:09:05.860 --> 2:09:10.980]  basically say join us and then we won't prosecute you and set you up with a huge
[2:09:10.980 --> 2:09:15.420]  anti-police capital that they're building up in the media and in the
[2:09:15.420 --> 2:09:20.500]  culture you think the only abuse in the world is the police and believe there
[2:09:20.500 --> 2:09:23.420]  are a lot of out of control cops a lot of thugs a lot of crazy people in
[2:09:23.420 --> 2:09:27.340]  society I've talked to a lot of executives a lot of folks and they just
[2:09:27.340 --> 2:09:33.180]  say public school principles you name it craziness is just intensifying and I
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:36.740]  mean I've run into the most arrogant hateful crazy police you can imagine
[2:09:36.740 --> 2:09:44.780]  well surrender a lot of good police but the issue here is that clearly and
[2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:49.220]  admittedly they're trying to start a civil war in this country and make
[2:09:49.220 --> 2:09:53.940]  every bad about local government and the police while the federal government
[2:09:53.940 --> 2:09:58.540]  has been totally taken over by foreign interest and is preparing to finally
[2:09:58.540 --> 2:10:02.740]  implode and take everything over completely and use financial collapse as
[2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:09.860]  a tool of ruination on our journey to slavery it's real simple George Soros
[2:10:09.860 --> 2:10:13.820]  funds getting our guns opening our borders and and going after the police
[2:10:13.820 --> 2:10:18.060]  and then it's out in the news that he and Bill and Melinda Gates and others
[2:10:18.060 --> 2:10:24.220]  are investing in all the same garbage they claim they're opposing they need
[2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:30.340]  us at each other's throats while they screw us over but that's wearing thin
[2:10:30.340 --> 2:10:33.700]  the establishment tried to sell Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton they fall and
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:36.340]  fly on their face the establishment knows they need some new rock star like
[2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:40.780]  Obama to fool folks a few more years and kick the can down the road the only
[2:10:40.780 --> 2:10:46.500]  way for the elites to kick the can down the road is to start truly reforming but
[2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:49.780]  they don't want reform they want to monopolize power and control for global
[2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:54.940]  domination in the energy race in the life extension race to control the future
[2:10:54.940 --> 2:10:59.740]  so they'll redistribute wealth to control people but they won't let free market
[2:10:59.740 --> 2:11:03.620]  go and innovation go because that might threaten their monopoly the only way
[2:11:03.620 --> 2:11:06.380]  you're going to keep the power you have and have a little bit of it in the
[2:11:06.380 --> 2:11:13.500]  future is to divest centralization go the Renaissance route believe in
[2:11:13.500 --> 2:11:18.660]  humanity turn back against your eugenicist ways well you've come too
[2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:22.100]  close to realizing your horrible plan so I know you're not I'm talking to your
[2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:25.300]  underlings who have been compartmentalized we're here to
[2:11:25.300 --> 2:11:29.980]  decompartmentalize people in the corporate and governing systems and
[2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:33.540]  believe me they tune in and they are decompartmentalized because no brags
[2:11:33.540 --> 2:11:39.300]  just fact I know what I'm talking about I know the terms I know the players I
[2:11:39.300 --> 2:11:45.260]  know the game I know the strategic long-term goals you go pay $5,000 in
[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:50.020]  New York or London or Vegas to hear top futurist and globalist speak you'll
[2:11:50.020 --> 2:11:54.100]  hear exactly what I'm saying but from their perspectives I know a lot of
[2:11:54.100 --> 2:11:58.500]  billionaires and CEOs and people and they listen to this show every day
[2:11:58.500 --> 2:12:04.300]  because they know I know what I'm talking about and the reason I throw that
[2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:11.660]  out there at people is you ignore this information at your very serious peril
[2:12:13.300 --> 2:12:17.260]  there are a lot of people know what's going on there are a lot of people in
[2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:22.220]  the government know what's going on and don't want this to happen but they're
[2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:26.660]  compartmentalized we get enough people aware in the general public what's
[2:12:26.660 --> 2:12:30.900]  happening and the games won't work anymore you think well half the public
[2:12:30.900 --> 2:12:36.540]  can't tie their shoelaces it's game over Alex no it's not game over because
[2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:41.300]  sure maybe half the public can't wipe their own hind end with both hands can't
[2:12:41.300 --> 2:12:45.780]  find their head from a hole in the ground you know I get it I'm sorry those
[2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:49.620]  people don't count the globalists tried to make everybody dumb so that only they
[2:12:49.620 --> 2:12:53.100]  would count but if we're on the other side awake the fact of the general
[2:12:53.100 --> 2:12:56.780]  public can't tie their shoelaces only makes us stronger as well because we
[2:12:56.780 --> 2:13:02.780]  are the largest minority people that are aware of the globalist paradigm and
[2:13:02.780 --> 2:13:05.500]  that's why they're desperate to get the dumbed-down masses fighting with each
[2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:08.740]  other to think that that's the reason they're losing their house and losing
[2:13:08.740 --> 2:13:12.260]  their job and things are going to hell in a handbasket they need to think it's
[2:13:12.260 --> 2:13:16.380]  because whitey did it or black did it or Hispanics did it or the Easter Bunny
[2:13:16.380 --> 2:13:21.420]  did it know the globalist social engineers are the author and if the
[2:13:21.420 --> 2:13:27.300]  public ever figures that out it's game over game over man game over and that's
[2:13:27.300 --> 2:13:30.420]  why they're pulling on all the stops and I know they've miscalculated speeding
[2:13:30.420 --> 2:13:36.780]  up their time frame game over man that's game over the globalist they have
[2:13:36.780 --> 2:13:44.060]  really pushed it so far and have lost the narrative and have really they got a
[2:13:44.060 --> 2:13:48.940]  crude term for it about something to the pooch but I'm not gonna say it I said
[2:13:48.940 --> 2:13:53.500]  yesterday the dog won't hunt the bird won't fly the boat won't float I've
[2:13:53.500 --> 2:13:56.860]  looked at it I've seen history I don't care how much high-tech gadgetry you've
[2:13:56.860 --> 2:14:00.660]  got how much propaganda you've got how much poison you put in the water humans
[2:14:00.660 --> 2:14:06.500]  are designed to adapt and overcome and you may stun 50% of the public but out
[2:14:06.500 --> 2:14:09.100]  of that other 50% there's gonna be a large percentage of those people that are
[2:14:09.100 --> 2:14:13.340]  gonna actually get more intelligent more vicious more aggressive under your
[2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:19.340]  attack and all your studies show that you fully know that so there's very few
[2:14:19.340 --> 2:14:22.540]  globalists at hundreds of millions of people worldwide that know exactly what's
[2:14:22.540 --> 2:14:25.620]  going on and let me tell you as you start putting the screws to people
[2:14:25.620 --> 2:14:29.940]  there's gonna be more I want to go to your calls Ron veteran Kevin Bob and
[2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:34.540]  Brenda we're gonna all you before dr. Paul Craig Roberts joins us let me see
[2:14:34.540 --> 2:14:40.380]  we should go to first again DoD is deserting Texas the enemy and training

[2:14:45.060 --> 2:14:50.140]  on the air hey Alex how you doing that's just all coming out in the open
[2:14:50.140 --> 2:14:54.580]  brother that's how I'm doing yeah I hear you man less than less than an hour
[2:14:54.580 --> 2:15:00.180]  ago I was driving on I-10 and saw one of those black helicopters no markings
[2:15:00.180 --> 2:15:06.580]  stealth helicopters fly over I-10 probably about 200 feet off the ground
[2:15:06.580 --> 2:15:14.100]  slow real slow and there's no military base around there yeah what they're
[2:15:14.100 --> 2:15:18.940]  doing is they admit conditioning us for military occupation in the future yeah
[2:15:18.940 --> 2:15:27.500]  because hot because Texas is a quote hostile state right so yeah they're
[2:15:27.500 --> 2:15:32.060]  they're already doing it there are it's already coming man yeah Texas wants
[2:15:32.060 --> 2:15:36.100]  prosperity and wealth and freedom and self-defense and security and
[2:15:36.100 --> 2:15:39.660]  everybody's running from California and New York as fast as they can here so
[2:15:39.660 --> 2:15:44.260]  where the enemy yeah yeah not to worry even the even that good we're just not
[2:15:44.260 --> 2:15:51.700]  total scum right and we don't lay down like California does well they knows
[2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:54.820]  what really scares them is they know the Texas government and I know this as
[2:15:54.820 --> 2:15:59.780]  well is getting hardcore because they've all been brought in and told join with
[2:15:59.780 --> 2:16:04.580]  the New World Order and they're like I mean they the globalists are scared of
[2:16:04.580 --> 2:16:09.020]  Texas because Texas could lead the rest of the country
[2:16:09.020 --> 2:16:14.220]  yeah they're scared I mean that's why they put us high priority it hostile
[2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:19.940]  hostile state you know that's why we're in the red because they're scared of us
[2:16:19.940 --> 2:16:24.380]  and they got Utah on there too because they know Utah's whole cosmologies about
[2:16:24.380 --> 2:16:28.180]  a globalist takeover and a federal takeover and how to fight it and I mean
[2:16:28.180 --> 2:16:31.900]  you know good luck I mean Utah has infiltrated the entire government I mean
[2:16:31.900 --> 2:16:35.700]  the feds are scared of the Mormons good luck the Mormons already infiltrated
[2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:40.140]  everything I mean the Patriots have infiltrated everything I mean the New
[2:16:40.140 --> 2:16:43.340]  World Order has got a big problem God bless you appreciate your call Ron Rob
[2:16:43.340 --> 2:16:48.940]  in Missouri you're on the air go ahead hi Alex for once I'm actually on topic
[2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:54.620]  this is a companion memorandum that I actually sent to show tips at info wars
[2:16:54.620 --> 2:16:59.980]  just today and it is Department of Defense instruction memorandum number
[2:16:59.980 --> 2:17:06.820]  132228 realistic military training off federal real property it's a 21 page
[2:17:06.820 --> 2:17:12.100]  document that I sent to you and the interesting thing is on page 21 they're
[2:17:12.100 --> 2:17:18.260]  assessing the risk levels and the risk levels are based upon media visibility
[2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:24.540]  and the possibility of legal liability from low to extremely high and extremely
[2:17:24.540 --> 2:17:28.660]  high says loss of ability to complete training or probability of the occurrence
[2:17:28.660 --> 2:17:32.020]  of a significant negative incident probably meaning
[2:17:32.020 --> 2:17:36.740]  media exposure negative media exposure and so forth sure they mentioned that a
[2:17:36.740 --> 2:17:39.980]  little bit the other document they're talking about coverage people seeing it
[2:17:39.980 --> 2:17:44.900]  for what it is absolutely and part of the PSOP is how to counter that guys look
[2:17:44.900 --> 2:17:51.140]  up Pentagon memorandum 13228 what's the specific header is the US Army special
[2:17:51.140 --> 2:17:56.820]  operations command and unclassified fo you oh something like that realistic
[2:17:56.820 --> 2:18:01.780]  military training RMT off federal real property Department of Defense
[2:18:01.780 --> 2:18:08.220]  instruction number 13228 Department of Defense instruction dot mill okay yeah
[2:18:08.220 --> 2:18:13.060]  anything else that's it thanks for the death why do you think they they list
[2:18:13.060 --> 2:18:18.260]  Texas and Texas in Utah well because that's probably where they have the
[2:18:18.260 --> 2:18:21.940]  highest incidence of preppers and people that are actually prepared and awake and
[2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:26.980]  know what's going on and have a lot of my family that's Mormon and they
[2:18:26.980 --> 2:18:30.940]  generally recommend they have at least a year supply of food and so there's a
[2:18:30.940 --> 2:18:36.340]  bottom line anybody self-sufficient is the enemy right anybody not on welfare
[2:18:36.340 --> 2:18:41.140]  as the enemy exactly all right thank you Rob let's jam in one more Kevin you're
[2:18:41.140 --> 2:18:46.260]  on the air what's your take on this is a vet hey Alex how you doing I'm doing

[2:18:55.980 --> 2:18:59.460]  they're gonna come in here and they're gonna show us that they're just gonna
[2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:05.100]  violate posse comma taught us right in our faces okay they're gonna try and
[2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:08.420]  they're gonna try and get us to acquiesce to that and they're gonna make us
[2:19:08.420 --> 2:19:13.300]  they're gonna make us think that we have to you know they're gonna show they're

[2:19:21.340 --> 2:19:25.380]  here you know it used to be a beautiful place we used to have gun ranges all
[2:19:25.380 --> 2:19:28.700]  over the place we used to go shooting I grew up shooting it's crazy what's
[2:19:28.700 --> 2:19:34.380]  happened here the laws have just gone completely awry and in a big way because
[2:19:34.380 --> 2:19:37.300]  well that's what you do first is you capture both the coastlines and then
[2:19:37.300 --> 2:19:40.260]  you take over the country you invade from the south using third world
[2:19:40.260 --> 2:19:44.020]  populations and you I mean that's it you shot off the energy sources you divide
[2:19:44.020 --> 2:19:46.980]  the people that are in the country you win it's how you take domination we're
[2:19:46.980 --> 2:19:50.140]  seeing a military Psyop take over and again the psyops pointed at the
[2:19:50.140 --> 2:19:54.420]  military to condition them this is all normal remember the end the globalists
[2:19:54.420 --> 2:19:58.180]  say their number one enemy is the military Kevin stay there I want you to

[2:24:44.500 --> 2:24:49.940]  listen I see and I've taken pictures of these vehicles there's a building that
[2:24:49.940 --> 2:24:53.180]  they've occupied around the corner here and hasn't been occupied for a long
[2:24:53.180 --> 2:24:58.900]  time and I started seeing these weird cars it's had DOT LA DOT plates on them
[2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:03.420]  so and I found that that's Los Angeles Department of Transportation I looked at
[2:25:03.420 --> 2:25:08.580]  a placard inside and I took pictures of it and I have them the placard says
[2:25:08.580 --> 2:25:14.900]  United States federal government health care law enforcement services and then
[2:25:14.900 --> 2:25:20.940]  there's another badge in there that says HSI and these guys are running around
[2:25:20.940 --> 2:25:27.860]  you know in this class it looks like in their little Chevy vehicles outfitted
[2:25:27.860 --> 2:25:32.340]  with police lights the whole nine yards they have unlimited fiat money backed up
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:36.260]  by our tax-paying money and they are just proliferating the takeover it's a
[2:25:36.260 --> 2:25:40.900]  21 it is a hellish what they're planning send us the photos in a brief

[2:25:44.100 --> 2:25:49.540]  newsworthy show tips at info wars.com amazing in fact I'm aware of those
[2:25:49.540 --> 2:25:53.020]  forces they're preparing they're they're getting contingency plans for
[2:25:53.020 --> 2:25:58.020]  collapse mercenaries at social security offices they're gearing up for something
[2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:01.900]  big folks thank you so much Kevin and they know Texas won't go along with a
[2:26:01.900 --> 2:26:06.220]  gun confiscation or Utah we're gonna be invaded they want to start a civil
[2:26:06.220 --> 2:26:09.940]  war this is the we're like French that didn't go along with Hitler we're the
[2:26:09.940 --> 2:26:13.180]  bad people we're the terrorists folks they're gonna blow stuff up and say we
[2:26:13.180 --> 2:26:17.500]  did it veteran in California as well what's your take on this you want to
[2:26:17.500 --> 2:26:21.140]  bring up multi-state military training I mean that's admittedly coordinated
[2:26:21.140 --> 2:26:27.340]  between eight states admittedly for America it's unprecedented go ahead hey
[2:26:27.340 --> 2:26:32.180]  Alex be careful I think you're coming out here in about a week you're coming
[2:26:32.180 --> 2:26:37.700]  out to the insurgent pocket of Southern California well I want to welcome you in
[2:26:37.700 --> 2:26:41.260]  about a week's time to the insurgent right there's only an insurgent area in
[2:26:41.260 --> 2:26:44.540]  Orange County there they list that as terrorists as well can you believe they
[2:26:44.540 --> 2:26:49.460]  list conservative libertarian areas as terrorists I think it's Orange County in
[2:26:49.460 --> 2:26:53.620]  San Diego it's the southern southern part of Southern California where you have
[2:26:53.620 --> 2:26:57.740]  a lot of document cam shot guys yeah that's a point you make I guess that's
[2:26:57.740 --> 2:27:05.340]  the only conservative area it could be but you know what I think I think as
[2:27:05.340 --> 2:27:09.780]  this thing progresses they're probably gonna wargame stuff to make places with
[2:27:09.780 --> 2:27:14.940]  lots of veterans like various places in Arizona and maybe even New Mexico they're
[2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:19.780]  gonna they're gonna become they're gonna start to turn red I'm sure during this
[2:27:19.780 --> 2:27:24.540]  you know if they if they run this little exercise like I think they would and I
[2:27:24.540 --> 2:27:29.460]  notice it's all in first they're calling the Patriots the red you're like
[2:27:29.460 --> 2:27:34.260]  where the commies it's just ridiculous yeah and here here's the thing I mean
[2:27:34.260 --> 2:27:39.300]  you know maybe it's not the folks that they maybe it's not the guys that would
[2:27:39.300 --> 2:27:44.580]  oppose the third term of Barack Obama but maybe it's the folks that would oppose
[2:27:44.580 --> 2:27:50.660]  something like actually what they're drafting right now which is it's
[2:27:50.660 --> 2:27:55.820]  basically from Department of Health and Human Services it's the National
[2:27:55.820 --> 2:28:01.100]  Adult Immunization Plan that's right you're gonna go against that maybe you
[2:28:01.100 --> 2:28:05.020]  need to be rounded up or maybe sure they can release a bio weapon or a
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:09.940]  simulant and use that they got a lot of ways to skin the Republic right well
[2:28:09.940 --> 2:28:15.340]  anyways actually I found on the site that there's actually it looks like it's
[2:28:15.340 --> 2:28:19.700]  we've got about two I think three days left for those that want to make a
[2:28:19.700 --> 2:28:25.340]  public comment for or against the strapped legislation that they're coming up
[2:28:25.340 --> 2:28:30.060]  with on the adult immunization plan who knows maybe you can make a contest out
[2:28:30.060 --> 2:28:35.580]  of it people can yes I mean I knew that was going on but send me a link to the
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:44.220]  public comment I guess that'd be with the FDA it's it looks no it's Department
[2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:49.340]  of Health and Human Human Services and it's it's not quite easy to get to but
[2:28:49.340 --> 2:28:53.540]  I can send me a link send me a link to show tips and info wars com thank you so
[2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:57.620]  veteran but but imagine if 20 years ago you were told they'll have military

[2:29:01.740 --> 2:29:06.740]  enemies I mean this is so illegal I mean it's so evil but who would have thought
[2:29:06.740 --> 2:29:11.660]  the president would open the borders up I mean it's it's happening it's
[2:29:11.660 --> 2:29:16.980]  happening yeah it sure isn't and be careful because you're gonna be in that

[2:35:36.620 --> 2:35:40.940]  affiliates and their sponsors as well now dr. Paul Craig Roberts was the
[2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:44.780]  former assistant secretary of state the former head editor of the Wall Street
[2:35:44.780 --> 2:35:48.900]  Journal and of course the best-selling author on many of the top think tanks in
[2:35:48.900 --> 2:35:54.820]  Washington as well so he's you know a big former insider and he has talked a
[2:35:54.820 --> 2:36:00.660]  lot about the fact that there is insanity by the ruling elite he was
[2:36:00.660 --> 2:36:05.260]  involved in the collapse of the Soviet Union negotiating that with him he's
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:08.500]  warned that Russia may use nuclear weapons well they came out Putin last
[2:36:08.500 --> 2:36:12.900]  week and said that we were preparing to use nuclear weapons if you continue to
[2:36:12.900 --> 2:36:17.580]  send an armor to attack us cracks in Washington's Empire Washington's EU
[2:36:17.580 --> 2:36:23.100]  vassals might be finding their backbone Roberts reported on this on the 18th a
[2:36:23.100 --> 2:36:28.140]  day later it was in AP Reuters everywhere basically the same headline that a
[2:36:28.140 --> 2:36:32.380]  whole bunch of countries Switzerland Luxembourg South Korea Japan Australia
[2:36:32.380 --> 2:36:43.460]  and others joined and also Britain Germany France and Italy to get into the
[2:36:43.460 --> 2:36:47.380]  Chinese-led Asian Investment Bank but some of the elite over here investing as
[2:36:47.380 --> 2:36:51.420]  well so this is a big deal it's a challenge the IMF and World Bank to
[2:36:51.420 --> 2:36:55.780]  dollar hegemon the globalists have been using to abuse US power and really
[2:36:55.780 --> 2:36:59.380]  destroying it long-term in the process destroying our soft power to quote
[2:36:59.380 --> 2:37:02.420]  Roberts so Roberts I'm going to shut up you've got the floor for the next 10
[2:37:02.420 --> 2:37:05.380]  minutes or so and I'll come back in with some other areas I want to get into
[2:37:05.380 --> 2:37:12.820]  but it does look like some of the first cracks in the bravada in the Hutzpah how
[2:37:12.820 --> 2:37:18.260]  big a deal are Putin's announcements about nukes and how big a deal is the
[2:37:18.260 --> 2:37:23.020]  situation and then how does that tie into yelling saying we may raise rates a
[2:37:23.020 --> 2:37:30.460]  little what's really going on well as you know Alex a great deal is going on
[2:37:30.460 --> 2:37:38.620]  the Chinese by bringing out this new Asian Investment Bank are in the process
[2:37:38.620 --> 2:37:44.820]  of displacing Washington's Asian Development Bank Washington uses
[2:37:44.820 --> 2:37:50.820]  development banks whether the Asian one or the World Bank or other of its
[2:37:50.820 --> 2:37:56.340]  financial creatures such as IMF to impose its financial and political
[2:37:56.340 --> 2:38:02.500]  hegemony on other countries China is much more clever and it's created this
[2:38:02.500 --> 2:38:07.620]  new bank in order to actually help countries and build friendships and to
[2:38:07.620 --> 2:38:12.300]  build trust and no one in longer trust Washington they know that it's a bully
[2:38:12.300 --> 2:38:19.220]  and then whatever it holds out to you is just the harness to put you in so the
[2:38:19.220 --> 2:38:26.460]  surprise development was the repeated with which American puppet states like
[2:38:26.460 --> 2:38:32.060]  Great Britain I mean Great Britain is a total American puppet state they had
[2:38:32.060 --> 2:38:36.700]  never make a decision without asking Washington what they should decide and
[2:38:36.700 --> 2:38:42.260]  yet Britain accepted this despite Washington's warning and opposition so
[2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:49.580]  did France Germany and Italy and then Australia and South Korea which initially
[2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:55.020]  had turned down the Chinese invitation to join as a result of Washington's
[2:38:55.020 --> 2:39:01.380]  pressure on them are now reconsidering what's what's precipitating this I think
[2:39:01.380 --> 2:39:10.100]  what's precipitating it is Washington is now so reckless it's so full of
[2:39:10.100 --> 2:39:15.620]  arrogance and hubris and really it's a it's a megalomaniac and the world is
[2:39:15.620 --> 2:39:20.980]  beginning to realize that they're under threat of destruction by the incessant
[2:39:20.980 --> 2:39:26.420]  lies coming out of Washington about war particularly with regard to Russia and
[2:39:26.420 --> 2:39:33.700]  to China these incessant lies about Russian invasions of Ukraine about
[2:39:33.700 --> 2:39:38.660]  appending the Russian invasion of the Baltics and Poland and they and they
[2:39:38.660 --> 2:39:46.580]  realized that Washington is so out of control in its own mind that its power
[2:39:46.580 --> 2:39:51.980]  is slipping that it's going to drive the whole world into a war in order to try
[2:39:51.980 --> 2:39:58.980]  to prevent their eyes of Russian China and so they're they're showing a move
[2:39:58.980 --> 2:40:05.060]  away from this control they're trying to show that the Empire's advances are
[2:40:05.060 --> 2:40:10.380]  shaky and that Washington needs to pull in its horns and back off I think that's
[2:40:10.380 --> 2:40:16.620]  really what's going on in addition the financial interests in those countries
[2:40:16.620 --> 2:40:22.580]  have to be disturbed by the massive creation of money and debt in the United
[2:40:22.580 --> 2:40:26.660]  States you know the money and debt in the last six or seven years has grown
[2:40:26.660 --> 2:40:33.540]  many multiples times greater than the gross domestic product that has to
[2:40:33.540 --> 2:40:38.420]  support that money and debt and so the whole notion of Washington as some sort
[2:40:38.420 --> 2:40:46.020]  of a financial safe house is diminishing when you look at China is really
[2:40:46.020 --> 2:40:52.660]  the only country in the world that has massive independent reserves it's the
[2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:58.620]  soundest financial system there is and so I think they're saying hey look we
[2:40:58.620 --> 2:41:03.380]  better remember that we can go down with the Americans if we don't make
[2:41:03.380 --> 2:41:09.100]  some sort of cage against our American bet and those hedges can expand quickly
[2:41:09.100 --> 2:41:13.700]  Putin's now called for a Eurasian currency union as well so the saber
[2:41:13.700 --> 2:41:18.860]  rattling is forcing people out of very compliant stance they were in just six
[2:41:18.860 --> 2:41:26.180]  years ago into a obstinate stance you summed it up very well Alex is
[2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:31.940]  exactly what's happening what's wrong with Washington because it's now
[2:41:31.940 --> 2:41:35.980]  national news ready for picked it up official army document it's public
[2:41:35.980 --> 2:41:41.300]  says they list conservative areas libertarian areas of California Texas
[2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:45.500]  in Utah as areas they think might have an uprising and they're having a joint
[2:41:45.500 --> 2:41:52.260]  forces command training to take on domestic groups and they list Texas as
[2:41:52.260 --> 2:41:57.740]  an enemy hostile I mean this is reaching twilight zone proportions who in the
[2:41:57.740 --> 2:42:01.140]  world would train the panic and then publicly put out I mean we know the
[2:42:01.140 --> 2:42:04.220]  Pentagon had plans to invade Canada but that doesn't mean they're gonna do it
[2:42:04.220 --> 2:42:08.420]  but they're actually training in huge military operations coming up this
[2:42:08.420 --> 2:42:15.020]  summer to basically invade Texas it you mean in the in the event of
[2:42:15.020 --> 2:42:21.060]  instability yes flaps and and some sort of yeah well we'll find out how tough
[2:42:21.060 --> 2:42:28.860]  Texans are you know Texas is a big place kind of like Afghanistan and if
[2:42:28.860 --> 2:42:34.300]  after 14 years Washington couldn't defeat a few thousand lightly armed
[2:42:34.300 --> 2:42:40.740]  Taliban and it's not likely to defeat the Texas but we'll see what happens
[2:42:40.740 --> 2:42:47.660]  clearly as you say Washington is insane they're unstable they're minimally
[2:42:47.660 --> 2:42:51.940]  unstable they're not just psychopaths well clearly they're insane drawing up
[2:42:51.940 --> 2:42:59.500]  war plans on Texas and Utah yeah look what what does the for example what does
[2:42:59.500 --> 2:43:05.620]  Utah senator Arnhatch think about this there's never anything out of any of them
[2:43:05.620 --> 2:43:11.860]  war plans against his home state what do the Texas senator say what does George
[2:43:11.860 --> 2:43:20.660]  W. Bush think there he is sitting in Texas and Watson is drawing up plans to
[2:43:20.660 --> 2:43:26.020]  invade Texas will he be a victim too well remember three years ago when the
[2:43:26.020 --> 2:43:28.860]  legislature passed in the house unanimously that they would indict
[2:43:28.860 --> 2:43:33.220]  people for groping at the TSA and then they before it passed the Senate it was
[2:43:33.220 --> 2:43:37.540]  in the AP they said we'll put F-16s in an embargo aircraft the immediate
[2:43:37.540 --> 2:43:42.180]  response was the same thing that started the Civil War a blockade that shows the
[2:43:42.180 --> 2:43:46.900]  hubris you used to be in Washington at the highest levels how has it changed
[2:43:46.900 --> 2:43:50.820]  since you were at the highest levels it's a different country Alex it's a
[2:43:50.820 --> 2:43:56.420]  different country it's nothing like what it was like when I was there I mean not
[2:43:56.420 --> 2:44:00.940]  that it was any kind of idealistic place there was a lot of corruption and
[2:44:00.940 --> 2:44:07.940]  cowardice and scheming and illegality and immorality but compared to what it is
[2:44:07.940 --> 2:44:15.220]  now it was like heaven there's no Ronald Reagan like you knew I guess pretty
[2:44:15.220 --> 2:44:18.860]  different when I've read and he credited you for economics what was he like
[2:44:18.860 --> 2:44:23.300]  versus what we have now well he never would have done any of this stuff he
[2:44:23.300 --> 2:44:29.860]  respected the Oval Office he respected the Constitution the kind of bad things
[2:44:29.860 --> 2:44:37.020]  he got roped into doing was part of forcing the Soviets to negotiate the
[2:44:37.020 --> 2:44:44.900]  end of the Cold War for example Granada and Nicaragua the neocons in the
[2:44:44.900 --> 2:44:49.740]  government before he fired them told him that you can't let there be a left-wing
[2:44:49.740 --> 2:44:55.220]  takeover in the Caribbean or in Central America because it will encourage the
[2:44:55.220 --> 2:45:00.220]  Soviets and you'll never get them to negotiate the end of the Cold War well
[2:45:00.220 --> 2:45:06.300]  that was his main goal in the Cold War and to cure the stagnation and he said
[2:45:06.300 --> 2:45:10.900]  you have to first fix the economy so you would have the resources which to
[2:45:10.900 --> 2:45:15.820]  threaten the Russians and drive them to negotiate and so the kinds of bad things
[2:45:15.820 --> 2:45:22.180]  he got looked into doing what roped into doing was the neocons using his main
[2:45:22.180 --> 2:45:27.460]  goal to achieve some of their as they had a policy at the Treasury number two
[2:45:27.460 --> 2:45:30.540]  guy there sitting down with Reagan how were you able over all of their
[2:45:30.540 --> 2:45:35.100]  objections able to get him to take on your economic plan that did create one
[2:45:35.100 --> 2:45:39.340]  of the biggest booms we've seen in the last century well actually he took it
[2:45:39.340 --> 2:45:44.260]  on before you got into offices or his campaign and when he got there he
[2:45:44.260 --> 2:45:48.700]  realized he was gonna have a hard time getting it out of his government and so
[2:45:48.700 --> 2:45:54.820]  he appointed me to get his program out of his own government so it could be
[2:45:54.820 --> 2:46:00.140]  voted on Congress so I didn't have to sell him on anything he was already sold
[2:46:00.140 --> 2:46:03.540]  on it and he put me in charge of it because he knew I was committed to it
[2:46:03.540 --> 2:46:08.580]  what would Ronald Reagan think today if he was seeing all this oh he would
[2:46:08.580 --> 2:46:13.940]  think that we had been taken over by the Nazis or something he would be
[2:46:13.940 --> 2:46:18.900]  astonished he wouldn't be able to understand it he was what this is not
[2:46:18.900 --> 2:46:24.140]  my country you know look what the United States has been doing the entirety of the
[2:46:24.140 --> 2:46:29.460]  21st century is murdering people I mean the United States has become murder
[2:46:29.460 --> 2:46:34.700]  incorporated it murders me all it does is murder people it is seven or eight
[2:46:34.700 --> 2:46:40.340]  countries have been repeatedly invaded bomb droned some of them are in total
[2:46:40.340 --> 2:46:45.980]  ruins we've talked about millions of people I'm dead mained or displaced and
[2:46:45.980 --> 2:46:52.060]  it's ongoing now they're starting on Russia so Ukraine is being sacrificed I
[2:46:52.060 --> 2:46:59.140]  mean it's a basket case and it's all to stop the rise of Russia we were going
[2:46:59.140 --> 2:47:05.660]  to get into this anyhow but let's talk about Putin's statements well initially
[2:47:05.660 --> 2:47:12.940]  Putin thought that Russia was now part of the West we're part of you again we're
[2:47:12.940 --> 2:47:17.740]  going to get along with you he got into the World Trade Organization he was the
[2:47:17.740 --> 2:47:23.980]  G7 was expanded to the G8 everything was fine until the United States went in
[2:47:23.980 --> 2:47:29.100]  organized a coup in Kiev throughout the elected government put in a puppet
[2:47:29.100 --> 2:47:32.740]  government essentially a Nazi government that hates Russians and they
[2:47:32.740 --> 2:47:37.660]  started killing Russians destroying Russian war monuments threatening the
[2:47:37.660 --> 2:47:42.300]  Russian populations in the eastern and southern Ukraine and Putin realized that
[2:47:42.300 --> 2:47:48.700]  the Americans would use Ukraine to grab the Soviet naval base in Crimea is the
[2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:55.660]  only warm water port and so he said holy smoke they're after us and and so he
[2:47:55.660 --> 2:48:01.100]  has been gradually catching on that this wasn't some kind of mistake that got
[2:48:01.100 --> 2:48:04.540]  away from the Americans that this was an intention and that the United States
[2:48:04.540 --> 2:48:12.300]  intends to turn Russia into a vassal state just like everybody else and he
[2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:16.980]  realizes that that's not going to happen and so he keeps issuing warnings they
[2:48:16.980 --> 2:48:21.940]  get stronger and they get stronger and they get stronger and he's relying I
[2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:28.740]  think perhaps mistakenly but maybe not he's relying on the main European
[2:48:28.740 --> 2:48:35.980]  powers such as Germany and France to realize that their populations the life
[2:48:35.980 --> 2:48:41.900]  their existence is being threatened by Washington by pushing them into a
[2:48:41.900 --> 2:48:46.780]  conflict situation with Russia and so he's relying on the French the Germans
[2:48:46.780 --> 2:48:53.380]  to simply leave NATO or put their foot down or start blocking the American
[2:48:53.380 --> 2:48:59.140]  aggression against Russia it's very difficult for Washington to carry this
[2:48:59.140 --> 2:49:05.700]  on without the complicity of your well the Germans lost 21 million people in
[2:49:05.700 --> 2:49:09.860]  World War two that was just 65 70 years ago the Russians lost that same amount
[2:49:09.860 --> 2:49:14.460]  you'd think it'd be fresh in their minds not to have a war with Russia well I
[2:49:14.460 --> 2:49:20.660]  think it is I think that's not what I mean a few of their crazy generals but
[2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:25.060]  other than that the population is totally against this you know and many of
[2:49:25.060 --> 2:49:30.580]  the members of the German Parliament the former chancellors and political
[2:49:30.580 --> 2:49:35.300]  leaders have all come out telling Merkel you're really got to stop being
[2:49:35.300 --> 2:49:40.180]  Washington's puppet we can't take these kinds of risk it's not in the interest
[2:49:40.180 --> 2:49:45.300]  of Germany or Europe you think they're blackmailing Merkel oh sure of course
[2:49:45.300 --> 2:49:49.620]  they are but there's no you know would you let somebody blackmail you if the
[2:49:49.620 --> 2:49:55.580]  consequence was going to be the destruction of iPhone or no but no I
[2:49:55.580 --> 2:50:01.140]  think that she's just slow on the uptake she's not you know she's it's not like
[2:50:01.140 --> 2:50:06.700]  she's some kind of genius and so many people are inculcated into the American
[2:50:06.700 --> 2:50:11.340]  myth that we are the white hats and the salt of the earth and the exceptional
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:15.940]  and the indispensable and the good guys and blah blah blah it takes them a while
[2:50:15.940 --> 2:50:23.620]  to see the reality and we did we did say that Merkel and Halan went to Russia to
[2:50:23.620 --> 2:50:29.420]  negotiate with Putin in the end of the Ukraine crisis and they did that over
[2:50:29.420 --> 2:50:33.220]  Washington's objection and you see every day that Washington is doing
[2:50:33.220 --> 2:50:39.620]  everything it possibly can to upset the agreement that Merkel and Halan
[2:50:39.620 --> 2:50:43.220]  you're saying overall things are going in a little bit better direction now
[2:50:43.220 --> 2:50:46.340]  correct me if I'm wrong we come back from breaking the final segment I don't

[2:53:59.020 --> 2:54:05.380]  in communities of this kind despotism stands a good chance the nine most
[2:54:05.380 --> 2:54:10.060]  terrifying words in the English language are I'm from the government and I'm
[2:54:10.060 --> 2:54:16.660]  here to help this huge well we're gonna do everything we can to help resistance
[2:54:16.660 --> 2:54:23.940]  to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones show because there is a war
[2:54:23.940 --> 2:54:31.420]  for your mind Paul Craig Roberts dot org in fall wars dot com present planet
[2:54:31.420 --> 2:54:34.780]  dot com I can just tell you not being dramatic there's a lot of stuff being
[2:54:34.780 --> 2:54:39.220]  done by behind the scenes to mess with us to shut us down it's only intensifying
[2:54:39.220 --> 2:54:43.500]  your efforts work thanks to your prayers and support out there they really
[2:54:43.500 --> 2:54:46.620]  mess a lot of folks you need to understand we really do have a tyranny
[2:54:46.620 --> 2:54:51.140]  but you can't be scared of it and then think that cowering will make it all go
[2:54:51.140 --> 2:54:55.860]  away getting in its face will bring it down and a lot of people in government
[2:54:55.860 --> 2:54:58.700]  are upset about what's happening we had William Benny here in studio the other
[2:54:58.700 --> 2:55:03.780]  day former director technical director of the NSA he says most people he talks
[2:55:03.780 --> 2:55:07.220]  to in government are totally freaked out and awake so I don't see how long this
[2:55:07.220 --> 2:55:12.300]  can go dr. Roberts finishing up on the state of the economy the fellow
[2:55:12.300 --> 2:55:17.020]  reserves announcements and just your gut feeling about our things starting to
[2:55:17.020 --> 2:55:20.620]  turn a little bit are we still in really bad trouble we had really bad
[2:55:20.620 --> 2:55:26.340]  trouble but first Alex let me finish up our prior conversation yes I don't want
[2:55:26.340 --> 2:55:31.900]  to leave it on an optimistic so what's happening right now is the United States
[2:55:31.900 --> 2:55:38.500]  is busy we're causing either coups or color revolutions in Armenia Kyrgyzstan
[2:55:38.500 --> 2:55:45.540]  and Uzbekistan so and they're renewing the conflict in Ukraine Washington is
[2:55:45.540 --> 2:55:51.580]  doing everything it can to destroy the agreement that was achieved in Minsk so
[2:55:51.580 --> 2:55:56.220]  soon Russia is going to have four Ukraine's they're going to have it back
[2:55:56.220 --> 2:56:00.780]  in Ukraine and they're going to have it in three countries along their under
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:07.740]  belly border with Asia we recently Victoria Newland was sent to Armenia to
[2:56:07.740 --> 2:56:14.460]  put in motion the color revolution there they have pulled out of retirement
[2:56:14.460 --> 2:56:20.660]  a notorious color revolution agent and sent him to Kyrgyzstan to destabilize
[2:56:20.660 --> 2:56:25.620]  that country and they've got another one of those terrible people in Uzbekistan
[2:56:25.620 --> 2:56:31.780]  and let's be clear they then put people like Joe Biden's son over multi-billion
[2:56:31.780 --> 2:56:37.300]  dollar infrastructures gas facilities and things to milk them so it's a
[2:56:37.300 --> 2:56:41.220]  classical mafia tactic they're not liberating these countries they're
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:45.780]  coming in to destabilize them and steal Russian-funded infrastructure well
[2:56:45.780 --> 2:56:51.580]  they're going to do that but the main purpose is to create instability for
[2:56:51.580 --> 2:56:58.340]  Russia and order that Russia cannot rise as a power that can check American
[2:56:58.340 --> 2:57:04.660]  purposes so if Russia's got four Ukraine's on its border is completely
[2:57:04.660 --> 2:57:10.500]  used up and it's no longer in America's way and also the trouble they're
[2:57:10.500 --> 2:57:16.300]  causing in Uzbekistan this can spill over into China and so they can
[2:57:16.300 --> 2:57:21.340]  simultaneously cause trouble for Russia for China to get splits between Russia and
[2:57:21.340 --> 2:57:24.180]  China or how to deal with the issue because they're interested in for
[2:57:24.180 --> 2:57:29.300]  somewhat in that part of the world and so this is a very clever policy at
[2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:33.980]  destabilizing the other two rising powers and and I think it's going to lead to a
[2:57:33.980 --> 2:57:41.940]  major war now that said we can turn to turn to the Fed what the Fed has done
[2:57:41.940 --> 2:57:48.900]  first of all the Fed is no longer an independent agencies managing the
[2:57:48.900 --> 2:57:55.900]  economic policy in behalf of the country and they are a special interest group
[2:57:55.900 --> 2:58:02.220]  that represents four or five major banks banks that deregulation free market
[2:58:02.220 --> 2:58:07.420]  deregulation that get too big to fail and so the entirety of American economic
[2:58:07.420 --> 2:58:13.380]  policy since 2008 has had one single purpose and that's to keep four big
[2:58:13.380 --> 2:58:18.980]  banks afloat and we already keep those big banks afloat they had to create
[2:58:18.980 --> 2:58:24.980]  trillions of new money in order to purchase the worthless assets that the
[2:58:24.980 --> 2:58:29.060]  banks sure doctor do do five more minutes with us in overdrive and put

[2:59:56.380 --> 3:00:06.100]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[3:00:06.100 --> 3:00:10.500]  because there's a war on for your mind
[3:00:11.500 --> 3:00:16.820]  former head of policy at the Treasury Department is an expert economist and
[3:00:16.820 --> 3:00:21.580]  can tell us what he sees going on with the Fed some countries are going below
[3:00:21.580 --> 3:00:25.940]  zero in interest rates they're talking about going up a little bit we see a lot
[3:00:25.940 --> 3:00:29.900]  of mainstream news admitting the economic outlook is grim so dr. Roberts
[3:00:29.900 --> 3:00:35.460]  give us your prognosis on that okay they talk about maybe pushing interest rates
[3:00:35.460 --> 3:00:41.220]  up in order to make people a little more comfortable holding dollars because the
[3:00:41.220 --> 3:00:45.700]  whole world understands that you can't have massive creation of money and debt
[3:00:45.700 --> 3:00:50.700]  and negative interest rates and so when they talk about raising interest rates
[3:00:50.700 --> 3:00:56.700]  it's just talk to try to block flight from the dollar that's all it is because
[3:00:56.700 --> 3:00:59.940]  if they raise the interest rates the stock market is going to collapse the
[3:00:59.940 --> 3:01:07.260]  bond market is going to collapse and they've got chaos when you've spent
[3:01:07.260 --> 3:01:13.900]  trillions of dollars to save four banks since 19 and since 2008 these are the
[3:01:13.900 --> 3:01:19.300]  banks that deregulation allowed to get too large and that and these are banks
[3:01:19.300 --> 3:01:24.500]  that gamble they don't make normal loans they gamble in a casino and they don't
[3:01:24.500 --> 3:01:28.660]  cover their bets the taxpayers cover the bets and the Federal Reserve covers
[3:01:28.660 --> 3:01:34.140]  the bets by printing money and buying the bad bets and that's what American
[3:01:34.140 --> 3:01:39.020]  economic policy is that's what the Fed is locked into it really has no way to
[3:01:39.020 --> 3:01:46.620]  get out of it can't get out of it and stuck with it and because it wouldn't
[3:01:46.620 --> 3:01:52.380]  let the banks fail because the banks control the Fed look who is who the
[3:01:52.380 --> 3:01:58.300]  secretaries of the Treasury been it's the former banksters who caused the
[3:01:58.300 --> 3:02:03.100]  financial crisis every one of them have rotated through the Treasury so they're
[3:02:03.100 --> 3:02:08.540]  protecting their own mistakes look at the Fed what is the Fed it's the same
[3:02:08.540 --> 3:02:14.260]  people look at the New York Fed who are the directors the New York Fed it's the
[3:02:14.260 --> 3:02:18.900]  same banks everybody at the Justice Department at the top is part of those
[3:02:18.900 --> 3:02:23.620]  lobbying groups and consulting groups that write the regulations and the
[3:02:23.620 --> 3:02:26.940]  policies and follow the papers to let the big banks get away with the
[3:02:26.940 --> 3:02:30.900]  derivatives I mean it's just a revolving door it's it's it's one small
[3:02:30.900 --> 3:02:34.620]  group and they control the economic policies so how they're going to take a
[3:02:34.620 --> 3:02:39.100]  decision that blows up everything they've been trying to do so they'll keep
[3:02:39.100 --> 3:02:43.500]  this going as long as they can they have everything rigged it's a house of
[3:02:43.500 --> 3:02:48.140]  cards but it's standing and it will continue to stand as long as foreign
[3:02:48.140 --> 3:02:52.180]  countries are willing to hold the dog what does it signify that even the
[3:02:52.180 --> 3:02:55.540]  Guardian reports that a lot of these big banker heads billionaires are building
[3:02:55.540 --> 3:03:00.180]  secret SRIPS and redoubts in New Zealand and in the Ozarks and in and that
[3:03:00.180 --> 3:03:07.060]  they're scared getting bodyguards I don't know I mean I don't know what it
[3:03:07.060 --> 3:03:12.500]  means but what we do know is the country does not have an economic policy that
[3:03:12.500 --> 3:03:18.220]  serves the country or serve business or serves economic growth you see they
[3:03:18.220 --> 3:03:23.580]  tell you that the Fed's policy is designed to encourage the economy but we
[3:03:23.580 --> 3:03:28.300]  don't see a recovery sure there's no recovery they make one up but it's not
[3:03:28.300 --> 3:03:32.180]  because they don't count the unemployed people it's amazing it's just insanity
[3:03:32.180 --> 3:03:37.180]  in the minute we have left I don't know how these four or five mega banks think
[3:03:37.180 --> 3:03:40.780]  they're gonna survive a nuclear war with Russia but maybe they're so arrogant
[3:03:40.780 --> 3:03:46.700]  they think that they're immune from that the the neoconservatives think that
[3:03:46.700 --> 3:03:50.940]  the United States can win the nuclear war because our stuff is better than the
[3:03:50.940 --> 3:03:56.460]  Russians and we have ABMs anti ballistic missiles and so when the Russians
[3:03:56.460 --> 3:04:01.620]  try to retaliate to our first strike they'll shoot their missiles down so
[3:04:01.620 --> 3:04:09.780]  this is the myth I'm reading a book now by I think Andrew Coleman is called
[3:04:09.780 --> 3:04:15.380]  what is it called it doesn't matter so but anyhow he shows that the United
[3:04:15.380 --> 3:04:22.340]  States has endless faith in technology is a way of you of conducting war and
[3:04:22.340 --> 3:04:27.300]  it always fails it has never worked ever it didn't work we know the Russians
[3:04:27.300 --> 3:04:31.540]  are gonna have subs pop up with cruise missiles and and then blow up every I
[3:04:31.540 --> 3:04:36.140]  mean it's gonna be an absolute disaster even sure we'll destroy them worse but
[3:04:36.140 --> 3:04:40.780]  there's so many nicks it'll destroy the whole planet it's insane it's insane but
[3:04:40.780 --> 3:04:44.980]  everybody in Washington is insane you know I have I have no confidence Alex
[3:04:44.980 --> 3:04:49.140]  that there's anybody in the government that has an ounce of integrity or an
[3:04:49.140 --> 3:04:52.140]  ounce of morale it's scary we have to talk to you more about this in the future
[3:04:52.140 --> 3:04:55.380]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts thank you so much have a great weekend sir
[3:04:55.380 --> 3:05:07.660]  guess your grandchildren
