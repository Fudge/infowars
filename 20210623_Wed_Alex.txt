[00:00.000 --> 00:18.640]  The
[00:18.640 --> 00:24.280]  policies of the Democratic Party have left the realm of reality and are opening the gates
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.280]  of hell.
[00:25.280 --> 00:31.720]  We're back, we were talking about U.S. Catholic bishops who are talking about denying President
[00:31.720 --> 00:36.720]  Biden communion for being pro-choice, Joy, what's your thoughts on this?
[00:36.720 --> 00:42.080]  Instead of really trying to fix things and talk about things that actually matter to
[00:42.080 --> 00:47.160]  people, the most important thing being climate change, they go to these cultural issues to
[00:47.160 --> 00:48.160]  distract.
[00:48.160 --> 00:51.680]  It's very similar to what the Republican Party is up to right now, they're grasping
[00:51.680 --> 00:56.240]  its drawers because they see that they will be extinct very soon, which is why they're
[00:56.240 --> 00:59.680]  trying to stop people from voting in many of the states.
[00:59.680 --> 01:02.800]  While the Republican Party continues to slumber.
[01:02.800 --> 01:07.280]  Since the day Donald Trump was inaugurated, the Democratic Party has been helplessly disorganized
[01:07.280 --> 01:10.480]  and totally ineffective as a political party.
[01:10.480 --> 01:15.480]  They wasted years chasing invisible Russian agents and then making weird and unintelligible
[01:15.480 --> 01:20.360]  sounds about something called Ukraine, it's still not clear what they meant by that.
[01:20.360 --> 01:24.640]  Their entire political strategy was bizarre and in the end it was counterproductive, it
[01:24.640 --> 01:28.000]  hurt them with voters, they went down in the polls.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.200]  Only buffoons do that in politics, these people couldn't organize your kid's birthday
[01:32.200 --> 01:35.800]  party, they didn't make their beds this morning.
[01:35.800 --> 01:41.480]  And yet suddenly out of nowhere, they roared back and took over the country.
[01:41.480 --> 01:45.800]  They did it in less time than it takes most people to go on spring vacation.
[01:45.800 --> 01:46.800]  What happened?
[01:46.800 --> 01:47.800]  How'd they do that?
[01:47.800 --> 01:50.960]  Well, it's simple, nobody stopped them.
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.040]  Whether it's critical race theory, a lot of things under attack, including critical
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.680]  race theory, which is being misrepresented by a lot of its opponents, you are accused
[02:00.680 --> 02:04.320]  of having little white children hate themselves.
[02:04.320 --> 02:05.960]  Can you please correct the record for me?
[02:05.960 --> 02:11.560]  Clearly, there's nothing in this project or in critical race theory that says anything
[02:11.560 --> 02:16.120]  about little white children and how little white children should feel.
[02:16.120 --> 02:17.960]  What is this Republican strategy?
[02:17.960 --> 02:20.880]  You talk about critical race theory, which is pretty much going to be teaching kids how
[02:20.880 --> 02:28.080]  to hate each other, how to dislike each other, that's pretty much what it's going to all
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.080]  come down to.
[02:29.080 --> 02:32.880]  You're going to deliberately teach kids, this white kid right here got it better than you
[02:32.880 --> 02:33.880]  because he's white.
[02:33.880 --> 02:37.760]  You're going to personally tell a white kid, oh, the black people are all down and suppressed.
[02:37.760 --> 02:40.440]  How do I have two medical degrees if I'm sitting here oppressed?
[02:40.440 --> 02:44.360]  Two medical degrees, no mom, no dad in the house, work my way through college, sat there
[02:44.360 --> 02:47.600]  and hustled my butt off to get new cars, you're going to tell me somebody look like all y'all
[02:47.600 --> 02:49.360]  white folks kept me doing that?
[02:49.360 --> 02:54.600]  Or the desperate lunge towards a one-party government under a new world order.
[02:54.600 --> 03:00.680]  I believe HR1 is a broad-sweeping piece of legislation, S1, and of course I wish that
[03:00.680 --> 03:05.040]  that would get to the floor for a vote, but I would very much like to see us getting something
[03:05.040 --> 03:09.640]  done and I think it's very, very important that we recognize that if we don't do something
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.320]  at the federal level, the democracy in my opinion is threatened.
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.160]  We're igniting the fuse on a nationwide crime epidemic.
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.280]  Crime is the number one issue among Democrats.
[03:20.280 --> 03:21.680]  Those are the people voting.
[03:21.680 --> 03:24.600]  What does that say about the defund the police movement?
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.600]  Do people know what it means?
[03:25.600 --> 03:26.600]  Do they know what it is?
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.600]  Do they know what they want?
[03:27.600 --> 03:32.880]  I think that there are a lot of police unions and GOP operatives that would like for us
[03:32.880 --> 03:37.520]  to believe that this recent crime wave has everything to do with this idea of defunding
[03:37.520 --> 03:38.520]  the police.
[03:38.520 --> 03:41.080]  But guess what Stephanie, the police haven't been defunded.
[03:41.080 --> 03:45.480]  The Austin City Council making major cuts to the Austin Police Department voting to
[03:45.480 --> 03:51.760]  slash about $150 million from APD, about a third of the police department's budget.
[03:51.760 --> 03:56.480]  So this rising crime is not the fault of the movement, it's actually the fault of the police
[03:56.480 --> 03:58.680]  and this has been our point all along.
[03:58.680 --> 04:03.440]  Why should we keep funding systems and institutions that keep rendering themselves ineffective?
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.600]  We should be talking about gun control, livable wages, fair housing, education, that's where
[04:09.600 --> 04:13.840]  we should be moving the money to to ensure truly safe streets.
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.520]  Fueled by a border crisis that has reached epic proportions, the Democratic Party has
[04:19.520 --> 04:22.120]  proven what we all expected.
[04:22.120 --> 04:29.240]  They are as incompetent as they are deadly and November 8th, 2022 can't come soon enough.
[04:29.240 --> 04:36.600]  There are 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats
[04:36.600 --> 04:39.880]  in the United States Senate that will be contested.
[04:39.880 --> 04:45.600]  39 state and territorial, gubernatorial and numerous other state and local elections
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.120]  will also be contested.
[04:48.120 --> 04:54.360]  This election will be the first to be affected by the redistricting that followed the 2020
[04:54.360 --> 04:56.080]  United States Senate.
[04:56.080 --> 04:58.400]  America, we must not be caught.
[04:58.400 --> 05:01.600]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[05:01.600 --> 05:02.600]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[05:02.600 --> 05:08.160]  I would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[05:08.160 --> 05:11.280]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year, okay?
[05:11.280 --> 05:18.000]  I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away.
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.480]  Living defense saved my life.
[05:19.480 --> 05:23.840]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[05:23.840 --> 05:25.280]  Living defense brought me back.
[05:25.280 --> 05:31.000]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[05:31.000 --> 05:37.800]  This is Matthew 24 verse nine, then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[05:37.800 --> 05:43.920]  kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be
[05:43.920 --> 05:48.040]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[05:48.040 --> 05:49.840]  That's right where we're at brother.
[05:49.840 --> 05:54.280]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and
[05:54.280 --> 06:20.920]  that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[06:20.920 --> 06:29.760]  More than 30 years ago I discovered a public plan to establish world government to use
[06:29.760 --> 06:35.480]  automation to make humans obsolete and then to exterminate at least 90% of the people
[06:35.480 --> 06:37.720]  off the face of the earth.
[06:37.720 --> 06:44.720]  I began to try as best I could being a person in high school to learn about this plot and
[06:44.720 --> 06:51.400]  develop a plan to stop it and I'm just an average person from Texas but being aware
[06:51.400 --> 06:56.680]  of this information and being able to reach out to other like minded humans that are against
[06:56.680 --> 07:01.160]  the globalist program we've been able to put up a pretty good fight against these people
[07:01.160 --> 07:06.680]  showing that if we can get mainline humanity and especially the middle class and also a
[07:06.680 --> 07:12.600]  lot of wealthy elites who aren't on the inside eugenics operation to say no to this plan
[07:12.600 --> 07:19.120]  we can save humanity because where the new world order is taking the planet is an extremely
[07:19.120 --> 07:21.720]  nightmarish place.
[07:21.720 --> 07:29.680]  Now what's really incredible is that they wouldn't pass some legislation to ban human
[07:29.680 --> 07:31.760]  animal cloning in the United States.
[07:31.760 --> 07:36.120]  They've also got just straight up human cloning going on for at least 40 years that the documents
[07:36.120 --> 07:37.120]  admit have happened.
[07:37.120 --> 07:42.320]  And you notice the specific type of clones I told you about us what's down in the news
[07:42.320 --> 07:46.440]  and planning humans inside animals, animals inside humans all sorts of just nightmare
[07:46.440 --> 07:53.160]  stuff that Fauci the mad scientist has been quarter backing for 45 years.
[07:53.160 --> 07:56.720]  So that just gives you an idea of what type of monster he is.
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.480]  And when I come out and criticize that they have mainstream news articles attacking me
[08:03.480 --> 08:09.640]  and major memes being pushed by Twitter that I'm a white supremacist.
[08:09.640 --> 08:12.160]  What does that have to do with not wanting human animal clones?
[08:12.160 --> 08:14.440]  I care about the safety of all human life.
[08:14.440 --> 08:15.440]  It means nothing.
[08:15.440 --> 08:16.760]  It's just a label they use.
[08:16.760 --> 08:18.680]  Same thing on Tucker Carlson.
[08:18.680 --> 08:23.560]  I've got Daily Beast articles and Newsweek articles and all these stories attacking
[08:23.560 --> 08:29.200]  Tucker Carlson because he attacked one of the top bioethicists in the world that's who
[08:29.200 --> 08:31.720]  the Rockefellers have put in this new ethics board.
[08:31.720 --> 08:33.920]  Oh, we don't follow the old ethics.
[08:33.920 --> 08:36.680]  This board says we can merge humans with machines.
[08:36.680 --> 08:40.320]  This board says we can put chemicals in a vaccine to sterilize you because it's the
[08:40.320 --> 08:45.160]  greater good and we're the scientific rulers that control all of this.
[08:45.160 --> 08:46.640]  Dr. Matthew Lau.
[08:46.640 --> 08:53.680]  One of the top bioethicists in the world heads up a major university operation in New York
[08:53.680 --> 08:58.440]  and when you read the articles and see the attacks it's like the dumb conspiracy Carlson
[08:58.440 --> 09:00.440]  and it's just claiming this is going on.
[09:00.440 --> 09:05.800]  He's totally nuts like that psycho Alex Jones, white supremacist.
[09:05.800 --> 09:10.600]  And these are globalist playing God taking over civilization and setting the precedent
[09:10.600 --> 09:14.600]  to force all of us in your body in Klaus Schwab's own words.
[09:14.600 --> 09:19.960]  So here's part of Tucker Carlson knocking it out of the park last night getting into
[09:19.960 --> 09:25.400]  this incredibly important issue of genetically engineering us so we can't eat meat and shrinking
[09:25.400 --> 09:27.360]  down our size.
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.360]  Right now in this and other countries funded by the secretive daisy chain of government
[09:32.360 --> 09:35.400]  health agencies and powerful NGOs.
[09:35.400 --> 09:39.400]  Governments you have never heard of but that could change your life forever.
[09:39.400 --> 09:43.600]  If they can engineer bat viruses to make them more infectious and whoops they escaped from
[09:43.600 --> 09:46.560]  a lab what else are they doing?
[09:46.560 --> 09:48.280]  You're not supposed to ask that question.
[09:48.280 --> 09:52.760]  You've been commanded to trust the science and get back to watching Netflix, plebe, only
[09:52.760 --> 09:55.000]  Neanderthals ask questions.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.800]  And honestly that has been the arrangement in science for quite a while now.
[09:58.800 --> 10:02.920]  You pay for it, we do it, it's all good.
[10:02.920 --> 10:04.800]  But why should that continue?
[10:04.800 --> 10:09.800]  Now that we know that liars and moral pygmies, people like Tony Fauci and the soulless bots
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.000]  at Google HQ are running global science, maybe it's worth being slightly more inquisitive
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.680]  about what's happening in labs around the world.
[10:18.680 --> 10:20.180]  Why not?
[10:20.180 --> 10:21.920]  It could affect us.
[10:21.920 --> 10:23.640]  For example take a look at this tape.
[10:23.640 --> 10:26.880]  It's from an annual conference called the World Science Festival.
[10:26.880 --> 10:31.880]  A few years ago the conference featured a professor of bioethics and philosophy at New York University
[10:31.880 --> 10:33.640]  called Matthew Lau.
[10:33.640 --> 10:38.640]  Lau was among the most influential bioethicists in the world and that's a fact that will amaze
[10:38.640 --> 10:41.240]  you once you see this tape.
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.400]  Here's Lau explaining that climate change can be solved with something called human
[10:45.400 --> 10:47.520]  engineering.
[10:47.520 --> 10:53.560]  My view is that what we need is a really robust ethical framework.
[10:53.560 --> 11:00.280]  And within this ethical, robust ethical framework we can, I think there's a way going forward
[11:00.280 --> 11:02.520]  where we can do this ethically.
[11:02.520 --> 11:06.520]  There's actually a lot of opportunities for this to solve big world problems.
[11:06.520 --> 11:09.840]  So one thing is the climate change.
[11:09.840 --> 11:15.360]  And there I'll just use, you know, sort of climate change is a really big problem.
[11:15.360 --> 11:16.720]  We don't really know how to solve it.
[11:16.720 --> 11:21.400]  But it turns out that we can use human engineering to help us address climate change.
[11:21.400 --> 11:24.640]  Okay, here's a tip.
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.760]  Anyone who uses the phrase robust ethical framework wouldn't know ethics if they got
[11:29.760 --> 11:31.240]  in the shower with him.
[11:31.240 --> 11:35.880]  And you know that for a fact because he uses the phrase human engineering.
[11:35.880 --> 11:37.080]  Human engineering?
[11:37.080 --> 11:39.800]  The name alone should make you pause and take a deep breath.
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.400]  People are not bridge abutments.
[11:41.400 --> 11:45.560]  You can't just add rebar, pour a few yards of concrete and improve the human condition,
[11:45.560 --> 11:47.400]  much less the human soul.
[11:47.400 --> 11:49.440]  People are living beings.
[11:49.440 --> 11:50.600]  They're alive.
[11:50.600 --> 11:52.080]  They can't be engineered.
[11:52.080 --> 11:56.240]  Lau, the eminent bioethicist, seems unaware of this.
[11:56.240 --> 12:00.440]  So he outlines some of his proposals in a recent paper in the Journal of Ethics, Policy,
[12:00.440 --> 12:01.600]  and Environment.
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.160]  In that paper, Lau suggests a solution to the problem, the pressing problem, of people
[12:06.160 --> 12:08.040]  eating hamburgers.
[12:08.040 --> 12:09.960]  People like hamburgers, it turns out.
[12:09.960 --> 12:11.800]  How can we get them to stop eating hamburgers?
[12:11.800 --> 12:14.480]  Well, not by convincing them that hamburgers are bad.
[12:14.480 --> 12:15.480]  That was the old way.
[12:15.480 --> 12:17.400]  That's how democracy worked.
[12:17.400 --> 12:21.440]  You would tell people something if they believed you, they didn't, if they didn't, they didn't.
[12:21.440 --> 12:22.960]  Because it was their country.
[12:22.960 --> 12:23.960]  It was their government.
[12:23.960 --> 12:24.960]  It was self-government.
[12:24.960 --> 12:27.360]  But it turns out that's too time consuming.
[12:27.360 --> 12:30.960]  The new model is we just use pharmaceuticals to make people comply.
[12:30.960 --> 12:35.120]  If your kids are getting up at eat, dope them out and they'll obey.
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.240]  And Lau proposes a nationwide system like that, a pill that would make people nauseous
[12:40.240 --> 12:41.920]  at the sight of red meat.
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.720]  Now, given that climate change is an existential threat that is limiting our time on earth
[12:46.720 --> 12:52.240]  to 20 years or 12 years or six months or pick your exaggeration, it's pretty hard to believe
[12:52.240 --> 12:55.400]  a pill like that would be optional.
[12:55.400 --> 12:57.640]  It would be mandatory pretty soon.
[12:57.640 --> 12:59.320]  Does that sound like a dystopian fantasy?
[12:59.320 --> 13:02.240]  Oh, it's not, because Lau is deadly serious.
[13:02.240 --> 13:05.320]  Watch him explain at the World Science Festival.
[13:05.320 --> 13:06.800]  So here's the thought, right?
[13:06.800 --> 13:13.000]  So it turns out that we know a lot about, so we have these intolerance to, for example,
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.200]  milk intolerance.
[13:15.200 --> 13:17.800]  And some people are intolerant to crayfish.
[13:17.800 --> 13:22.520]  So possibly we can use human engineering to make it the case that we're intolerant
[13:22.520 --> 13:23.760]  to certain kinds of meat.
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.440]  To certain kinds of bovine protein.
[13:26.440 --> 13:29.080]  So that's something that we can do through human engineering.
[13:29.080 --> 13:36.000]  We can kind of possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  Human engineering.
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.920]  Why do we laugh at Alex Jones' again sincere question?
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.880]  But again, says the bioethicist, human engineering is the answer.
[13:45.880 --> 13:47.600]  But wait a second, you ask.
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.440]  Human engineering, that's kind of creepy.
[13:50.440 --> 13:53.040]  Didn't we try this kind of thing in Europe 80 years ago?
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.720]  And at the time, didn't we agree we're not going to do that ever again?
[13:56.720 --> 13:57.920]  True.
[13:57.920 --> 14:00.200]  But bioethicists have short memories.
[14:00.200 --> 14:03.880]  In any case, climate change is a pressing emergency, so we don't have time to consider
[14:03.880 --> 14:08.160]  the consequences of our response to this existential crisis.
[14:08.160 --> 14:11.600]  So here's an idea, says Lau at the World Science Festival.
[14:11.600 --> 14:15.520]  Let's fiddle with the human genome to see if we can make human children smaller than
[14:15.520 --> 14:16.520]  they are now.
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.680]  A race of dwarfs.
[14:17.680 --> 14:21.320]  They would eat less and they'd be cheaper to transport.
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.040]  Because that would reduce greenhouse gases.
[14:24.040 --> 14:30.800]  So it turns out that the larger you are, think of the lifetime sort of greenhouse gas emissions
[14:30.800 --> 14:35.680]  that are required, the energy that's required to transport larger people rather than smaller
[14:35.680 --> 14:37.840]  people.
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.400]  But if we're smaller, just by 15 centimeters, that's a mass, I did the math and it's about
[14:44.400 --> 14:47.400]  mass reduction of 25%, which is huge.
[14:47.400 --> 14:53.360]  And 100 years ago, we're all on the average smaller, exactly about 15 centimeters smaller.
[14:53.360 --> 14:59.440]  So think of just the lifetime greenhouse gas emissions if we had smaller children.
[14:59.440 --> 15:03.480]  And so that's something that we could do.
[15:03.480 --> 15:08.640]  Imagine if we had smaller children, little tiny children, think of how little they would
[15:08.640 --> 15:10.720]  emit in greenhouse gases.
[15:10.720 --> 15:16.000]  Think about an easy way to come up, juggle them around, control them.
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.480]  All we need to do is experiment on human children and we can solve climate change.
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.880]  That was at a public conference five years ago, nobody said anything, that's where we
[15:25.880 --> 15:26.880]  are.
[15:26.880 --> 15:27.880]  Surprised?
[15:27.880 --> 15:28.880]  You shouldn't be surprised.
[15:28.880 --> 15:32.880]  In fact, what you just heard is less ghoulish than some of the things happening in labs
[15:32.880 --> 15:34.920]  right now.
[15:34.920 --> 15:40.440]  This is what science looks like when it's been completely decoupled from wisdom and
[15:40.440 --> 15:42.480]  from decency and from Christianity.
[15:42.480 --> 15:46.560]  It is a science fiction novel, come to life, except it's real.
[15:46.560 --> 15:49.120]  In fact, Google might be funding it right now.
[15:49.120 --> 16:18.960]  My Gallagher is a Wisconsin member of Congress, he's a Republican and happy to have him on
[16:18.960 --> 16:20.440]  the slide.
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.160]  All right.

[17:36.980 --> 18:02.260]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[18:02.260 --> 18:07.060]  scientific literature is overwhelming. It's good for your heart, your brain, your whole body,
[18:07.060 --> 18:11.380]  your well-being. A lot of folks take it before they take tests. People that have arthritis
[18:11.380 --> 18:16.100]  pain, they take it. It's well known for the things it does for a body. It makes our lives
[18:16.100 --> 18:22.340]  so much better. But then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil. We've got both
[18:22.340 --> 18:26.180]  in the fullwarstore.com. But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down,
[18:26.180 --> 18:29.940]  so it's been months and months and months since we've had krill oil back at stock.
[18:29.940 --> 18:34.260]  But let's back, ladies and gentlemen. And despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced
[18:34.260 --> 18:39.540]  for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time
[18:39.540 --> 18:44.340]  at infowarstore.com with free shipping and double-paid credit points. Because I want
[18:44.340 --> 18:47.140]  those of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it. And I want
[18:47.140 --> 18:51.940]  new viewers and listeners who have tried it to get it from us. And then try regular krill oil
[18:51.940 --> 19:00.260]  that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours. This is the highest grade back at stock at lowerstore.com.
[19:22.740 --> 19:36.740]  Well, there are three major college schools of health in the U.S. that produce the top
[19:36.740 --> 19:46.020]  bioethicism thing created by the post-Nazi globalist about 60 years ago. And bioethics,
[19:46.020 --> 19:51.140]  well, they decide the new ethics. And you've heard Governor Northamry says we keep them
[19:51.140 --> 19:57.540]  maybe alive. We take its organs even after it's nine months old. And we kill it, but it's not a
[19:57.540 --> 20:04.020]  human because the bioethics board decides whether you're viable or not, even if you have all your
[20:04.020 --> 20:08.660]  fingers, all your toes, and are a perfect little baby boy or baby girl. Black, white,
[20:08.660 --> 20:15.060]  doesn't matter. They decide who's human. They decide who isn't. They're God. But they're liberal,
[20:15.060 --> 20:20.340]  so it's okay if they dress up in blackface and KKK outfits. Because, you know, they're going to give
[20:20.340 --> 20:26.660]  you legal aliens free tuition like Governor Northam has just announced, but in state, people don't
[20:26.660 --> 20:34.020]  get that. It's all about rubbing it in your face. Now, we just joined us. I played a Tucker Carlson
[20:34.020 --> 20:38.660]  clip from last night. We, of course, covered the last few days here as well. The great Owen
[20:38.660 --> 20:47.860]  Schreuer sitting in for me. And this is a top bioethicist. He heads up the major college
[20:47.860 --> 20:55.380]  on global health center for bioethics at New York University. And he sits on some of the biggest
[20:55.380 --> 21:03.700]  boards in the world, including the UN. And he just says he suddenly got this idea to genetically
[21:03.700 --> 21:12.260]  engineer us where we can't eat meat. Oh, he also just got an idea to make the general worker class
[21:12.260 --> 21:20.740]  three feet tall. But, of course, Aldous Huxley wrote in 1932 Brave New World, his brother founded
[21:20.740 --> 21:26.260]  the World Eugenics Society, his brother founded the transhumanist movement, his brother founded
[21:26.260 --> 21:32.500]  UNESCO and really founded the United Nations and ran the whole thing for 30 years. And he wrote in
[21:32.500 --> 21:42.180]  1932 the entire plan of injections at first in utero to stunt the IQ and size of the general
[21:42.180 --> 21:46.740]  public. Then they would add chemicals to basically make the genitals shrivel away and go away.
[21:48.020 --> 21:58.500]  And that's when they decided to even keep humans around. So when you hear Dr. Matthew Lau on TV
[21:58.500 --> 22:02.740]  telling you how great it is that they're going to engineer your body and they're going to make you
[22:02.740 --> 22:08.340]  take these injections and now they're doing it. Remember, this is part of a long term strategic
[22:08.340 --> 22:13.780]  plan. And some would say, well, why don't they change their plan? Because the plan's 160 years old.
[22:14.500 --> 22:21.780]  It was launched in the 1850s, a 20 year study was done. And by 1870, they had an official battle
[22:21.780 --> 22:28.100]  plan. And they said we're going to figure out how to smash matter together and create huge
[22:28.100 --> 22:33.460]  explosions. We're going to learn what makes the body tick and learn how to reprogram humans.
[22:34.580 --> 22:40.260]  Oh, and I forgot the rest of it. It's in my film Endgame. This is in mainline histories about
[22:40.260 --> 22:46.740]  Galton, Wedgewood, Darwin, the Huxleys. They all intermarried to try to create supermen.
[22:47.860 --> 22:51.860]  And they found that when they created these inbred people from the smartest people they had,
[22:51.860 --> 22:59.380]  that they became very attuned or psychic to what they believed were extraterrestrials
[23:00.420 --> 23:06.740]  who would then tell them about the plan. And now you're living it, the 5G, the making us midget
[23:06.740 --> 23:11.700]  creatures, the poisoning us where we can't eat meat, making us eat bugs. And this is what you
[23:11.700 --> 23:15.860]  do if you were evil aliens that wanted to toy with us and basically watch us tear each other
[23:15.860 --> 23:20.340]  apart. Now, whether you believe in that or not, that's mainline history. Let me show you real
[23:20.340 --> 23:28.180]  quick here. This is just three weeks ago. Senate Dems reject ban on certain types of human animal
[23:28.180 --> 23:32.820]  hybrid. Remember, that didn't exist. Of course, it's always existed. The Bible talks about it.
[23:32.820 --> 23:37.140]  Senate votes down legislation to outlaw creation of human animal chimeras.
[23:38.820 --> 23:44.500]  And this is not a brave new world. 1932 was published. The lower caste said Mr. Foster,
[23:44.500 --> 23:52.180]  the shorter the oxygen. The first organ affected is the brain. After that, the skeleton. At 70%
[23:52.180 --> 23:58.580]  of normal oxygen, you get dwarfs. At less than 70, eyeless monsters. And, you know, at first,
[23:58.580 --> 24:02.500]  when they took over in this fictional world that's really in our future, Britain then,
[24:03.460 --> 24:07.460]  but now in present time, they first started having women wear masks. They told us we were
[24:07.460 --> 24:14.100]  dirty and bad. Humans are evil. You need to have your children artificially born by Caesarean.
[24:14.100 --> 24:17.620]  You need to be programmed. You need to be controlled. You need to be forced to be inoculated.
[24:17.620 --> 24:25.620]  And then they take full control of society in about 50 years. And then they basically grow most
[24:25.620 --> 24:30.180]  of the population in tanks. And they like to keep them just a few feet tall so they can feel powerful
[24:30.180 --> 24:34.900]  and big and rule over them. Then you've got the superclass that gets all the life extension
[24:34.900 --> 24:39.220]  and all the rest of it above them. You go, oh, yeah, I've seen like 50 movies like that.
[24:39.220 --> 24:44.740]  Logans run, the list goes on and on. Because they're preparing you for it. Because they're
[24:44.740 --> 24:48.420]  doing it to you. And they think you're so stupid you won't stop them.
[24:52.020 --> 24:57.220]  We literally have hundreds of TV shows and programs now saying it's time to sterilize
[24:57.220 --> 25:01.140]  everyone with vaccines to save the earth. Why do you think they're telling you that in movies and
[25:01.140 --> 25:05.140]  cartoons and work? Because they want to condition you to accept it. And they know as the general
[25:05.140 --> 25:10.180]  public wakes up to it, they can convince the general public, oh, you're part of it.
[25:10.980 --> 25:14.420]  You're not being sterilized. You're not being dumbed down. You're not being poisoned.
[25:14.420 --> 25:19.380]  Even though you are, they've trained the public to be evil to imagine and pretend
[25:20.660 --> 25:25.540]  that they're part of the captors. And they have a name for that called Stockholm Syndrome.
[25:27.380 --> 25:29.460]  And so you see all these people going along with
[25:29.460 --> 25:35.620]  pedophiles, storytime at schools, and all this is about getting you to unnatural things.
[25:35.620 --> 25:39.940]  Can a big fat man dress like it the clown, come and have your daughters and sons sit on
[25:39.940 --> 25:46.180]  their lap while they hump them. And if you'll let a big fat goblin man hump your child
[25:46.180 --> 25:50.500]  at drag queen storytime, you'll let them do anything they want.
[25:52.740 --> 25:56.820]  So it's about, oh, be so loving you have no instincts. You have no common sense.
[25:56.820 --> 26:02.740]  Go talk to the man at the park in the white van. Get in the back. Hell, they have that in
[26:02.740 --> 26:07.700]  school at elementary schools, books turned out nationwide, sitting in England teaching
[26:07.700 --> 26:11.940]  seven-year-old boys, if a man comes to the park and takes you to the bathroom
[26:11.940 --> 26:16.180]  and pulls your pants down and starts and they say what they do to the kid, enjoy it.
[26:17.060 --> 26:20.980]  That's public schools, teacher seven-year-olds to be kidnapped and murdered.
[26:20.980 --> 26:29.140]  Because the whole thing is about murdering you. They're going to murder you. Comprende?
[26:31.060 --> 26:35.860]  So we've let it all out. I don't know if it's aliens that run it, but I know in the ancient,
[26:35.860 --> 26:40.660]  every ancient text it said, entities come and they demand children be sacrificed under the
[26:40.660 --> 26:46.660]  Babylonians, under the Egyptians, under the Mesoamericans, the Aztecs, the Toltecs, under the
[26:46.660 --> 26:52.740]  Druids, every culture, built pyramids and sacrificed children to what they called snake gods.
[26:54.820 --> 26:58.500]  And now they've got all these shows about not just kids having sex with kids when they're eight
[26:58.500 --> 27:04.500]  years old, now it's about having sex with animals and sex with clones and sex with demons.
[27:05.620 --> 27:10.660]  And it's all just meant to make it look hideous and strange and weird to get you confused so
[27:10.660 --> 27:14.980]  that when you start seeing all these horrors and all this death, you'll conform. Remember what I
[27:14.980 --> 27:21.620]  told you? Three years ago I got invited to the Sundance Film Festival and I didn't have time to
[27:21.620 --> 27:26.740]  go so I sent an associate, smart guy, and he said none of them knew why they were being told to do
[27:26.740 --> 27:31.300]  it, but everyone said in the next few years everything's got to be destroyed, everything's
[27:31.300 --> 27:37.620]  got to be ugly and confusing, it's like we're trying to make everyone commit suicide. And now
[27:37.620 --> 27:41.940]  you see the Netflix shows, that's exactly what it is, every deity that demanded human sacrifice,
[27:41.940 --> 27:45.940]  that demanded death, and the UN set in the 60s, once they launched their takeover plan,
[27:45.940 --> 27:50.260]  they would reinstate human sacrifice. It's called partial birth abortion.
[27:51.220 --> 27:54.740]  We come back, I'll give you the rest of the story straight ahead, but they're making their move on
[27:54.740 --> 28:04.660]  us right now. Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the ear, go ahead.
[28:04.660 --> 28:10.180]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the
[28:10.180 --> 28:15.220]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[28:15.220 --> 28:21.140]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[28:21.140 --> 28:28.660]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually, people think I'm 55 years old, and I was already
[28:28.660 --> 28:32.980]  taking your other supplements, but I thought you know, well maybe that's what I need to do,
[28:32.980 --> 28:36.900]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started taking it,
[28:36.900 --> 28:42.180]  it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[28:42.180 --> 28:46.580]  okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't,
[28:47.460 --> 28:52.740]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully,
[28:52.740 --> 28:59.220]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin. All the evil men in Tares seem to flourish as
[28:59.220 --> 29:03.700]  the good men do nothing. Well, I'm trying to be a good man, I'm trying to stand up to the right
[29:03.700 --> 29:10.020]  thing, and I've seen huge effects with what we've done here in Info Wars, other good men and women
[29:10.020 --> 29:14.980]  getting together and telling the truth and standing up to corruption, but now the globals are coming
[29:14.980 --> 29:19.620]  after us, and so I need your prayers, I need your financial support, I need your word of mouth to
[29:19.620 --> 29:24.100]  stay in the fight. We've got a big sale going right now, pre-shipping double patriot points on

[31:36.020 --> 31:43.220]  So there is a scientific takeover plan of the earth taking place by people that want to play
[31:43.220 --> 31:49.780]  God and think they're God and they follow an exact mission. It doesn't matter if it's stuff I read
[31:49.780 --> 31:54.980]  that Darwin was saying in the 1870s or what his cousins were saying the Wedgewoods and the
[31:54.980 --> 32:04.020]  Galtons or what Aldous Huxley wrote in 1932 or what this head U.S. world bioethicist he decides
[32:04.020 --> 32:08.340]  what's ethical and not and then they try to tell police you have no jurisdiction. Remember Governor
[32:08.340 --> 32:13.460]  Wortham three years ago when he said we make a decision to take baby keep it comfortable but
[32:13.460 --> 32:17.620]  take its organs and he goes and we don't get law enforcement involved the government it's between
[32:17.620 --> 32:22.260]  the government it's between not between the government the mommy it's the mommy and the
[32:22.260 --> 32:30.900]  doctors in the board. So they're announcing their own law their own system their own Sanhedrin where
[32:30.900 --> 32:38.980]  this professor says we're going to come in to save from global warming engineer you to be shorter.
[32:40.500 --> 32:47.300]  We are going to inject you with things where your body has an autoimmune response to red meat
[32:47.300 --> 32:52.180]  and attacks itself if you eat it so you get sick. Well what do you think happens now once you've
[32:52.180 --> 32:58.580]  taken these mRNA injections. I've talked to multiple doctors they say no woman that takes
[32:58.580 --> 33:04.660]  the vaccine while she's pregnant ever delivers the baby and we've got big headlines out about oh
[33:04.660 --> 33:13.540]  more record numbers of rare heart problems and blood clots. In fact I had that article Rob do gave
[33:13.540 --> 33:18.100]  it to me I think I went and left at my office so just have Rob do reprint me that latest article
[33:18.100 --> 33:22.580]  because every day it's the same thing oh more rare cases oh a bunch more people died a bunch
[33:22.580 --> 33:27.060]  more people got sick a bunch more young people had heart attacks but it's okay because it's rare
[33:27.060 --> 33:35.060]  and don't worry the CDC the very group running all this the very group in charge of all of this
[33:35.060 --> 33:45.140]  the very group launching this is the group that is investigating itself but at least we got rid
[33:45.140 --> 33:53.460]  of Peter Dazwick didn't we the head of the Bill Gates program the head of the Google program
[33:53.460 --> 34:00.820]  the head of the Fauci program all the major programs at Wuhan he was the bag man he just
[34:00.820 --> 34:05.380]  so happens to want to depopulate the earth he just so happens to be a eugenicist he just so
[34:05.380 --> 34:09.220]  happens to believe we need global carbon taxes he just so happens to believe there are too many
[34:09.220 --> 34:15.540]  people but he loves you so much he's the guy that got the zoological diseases and soup them all up
[34:15.540 --> 34:22.180]  into this virus well he was over the investigation a year ago and six months ago and the public
[34:22.180 --> 34:28.340]  said wow we shouldn't have the guy that was involved in running the second cover-up when he ran the
[34:28.340 --> 34:33.700]  first cover-up we even got emails where he said to the landscape well i wrote your paper but you
[34:33.700 --> 34:39.460]  just put some people's names on it and don't tell people i'm on the paper because you know i run the
[34:39.460 --> 34:47.940]  lab it's like there's a murder your next one neighbor gets murdered and you just have to be
[34:47.940 --> 34:53.940]  the police chief you say well i'll investigate who killed my neighbor you wouldn't be a suspect at
[34:53.940 --> 34:59.220]  first but then your lieutenants your captains would probably say why is that chief that you're
[34:59.220 --> 35:04.580]  going to run the investigation and that's not normal you need to refuse yourself as a college
[35:04.580 --> 35:13.220]  bidder oh no i'm gonna i'm gonna run this investigation let me look at it oh remember
[35:13.220 --> 35:18.500]  like a year ago and again six months ago oh it's the international coalition the un is there with
[35:18.500 --> 35:23.300]  scientists to investigate they show up for three hours and leave because they had offices inside
[35:23.300 --> 35:32.020]  it's peter dazik in the car leading the group so these oily criminal control pranks working for
[35:32.020 --> 35:37.220]  ultra-rich bankers and inbreds families that have trillions of dollars who say they want to get rid
[35:37.220 --> 35:42.260]  of you and your family well now we find out google was one of the main sponsors of the game of function
[35:42.260 --> 35:47.780]  program well of course they were involved in suppressing treatment for it and they were involved
[35:47.780 --> 35:53.140]  in suppressing those that were critical of the lockdowns and what is in biden's new anti-terrorism
[35:53.140 --> 35:59.940]  package the new the new directive for the u.s military cia fbi domestically the american people
[35:59.940 --> 36:05.540]  and anyone questioning lockdowns that's an act of white supremacism it actually says it it defines
[36:05.540 --> 36:14.580]  white supremacism terrorism and it says like protesting lockdowns or criticizing the vaccines
[36:14.580 --> 36:20.260]  or questioning the election you don't question some experimental injection from no you don't
[36:20.260 --> 36:26.340]  you don't you don't question any of that you shut down you shut up you roll over and you die
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.540]  and you're like this is over the top that's the whole point of attorney it is over the top
[36:33.220 --> 36:36.340]  but the soviet started taking over the whole planet or when hitler started attacking all
[36:36.340 --> 36:42.580]  his neighbors but that's what crazy madmen do yeah there's articles the whiteness of
[36:42.580 --> 36:51.780]  anti-lockdown protest this isn't a joke ladies and gentlemen and and look that was last year told
[36:51.780 --> 36:56.420]  the same group running it they had articles everywhere saying protesting lockdowns is white
[36:58.100 --> 37:01.300]  the same thing was said in australia and then now it's in the official
[37:01.940 --> 37:04.500]  i had it like last tuesday printed off he does reprint me the new
[37:05.460 --> 37:11.140]  terrorism directive of biden it's kind of blue eagle on the front and it's signed by the president
[37:11.140 --> 37:19.700]  and it says all this it says you do not question us period there's another one why anti-lockdown
[37:19.700 --> 37:24.580]  protests are a magnet for white supremacists and foreign extremists that was in may of last year
[37:24.580 --> 37:29.540]  that was the talking point now a year later it's in the official u.s. government policy
[37:30.500 --> 37:34.020]  and they were all over twitter last night and all over the internet today and a news
[37:34.020 --> 37:38.980]  article is going well the white supremacist tucker has gone one further now he says you know
[37:38.980 --> 37:43.620]  you know we laugh at alex jones for this but it's true they want to engineer the human body
[37:44.820 --> 37:48.180]  claus Schwab says the final revolution is to take over our bodies
[37:50.900 --> 37:58.420]  and who's taking them over and for what purpose here's the articles to see nbc cdc finds more
[37:58.420 --> 38:04.500]  cases of rare heart inflammation than expected after covid vaccine shots oh finds more than
[38:04.500 --> 38:09.460]  expected but the word rare is always put in there because that's the order to pick up all
[38:09.460 --> 38:13.380]  these patterns folks then later you get the actual documents like i pointed out a year ago
[38:13.380 --> 38:16.100]  the people running the luhan lab were the ones writing the reports
[38:18.420 --> 38:25.220]  they tried to hide it but we noticed it but don't worry mcdonald's is giving out the shot
[38:25.220 --> 38:38.100]  to the drudge report but here is bioethicist calls for genetically modifying humans to induce
[38:38.100 --> 38:42.740]  meat intolerance the bioethicist in the world economic forum is great reset called for human
[38:42.740 --> 38:48.100]  beings to be genetically engineered to become smaller in size and meat intolerant in the name
[38:48.100 --> 38:53.540]  of fighting climate change just like the globalists say you don't have children but they do so
[38:53.540 --> 38:58.660]  they'll be six feet tall you'll be one foot tall during a lecture 2016 world science festival
[38:58.660 --> 39:04.820]  dr mathieu lau director of the global college of public health center for bioethics at new york
[39:04.820 --> 39:10.740]  university explained his vision of the future for you and your family but why is this important
[39:10.740 --> 39:15.460]  only now do people care and only now are people starting to read what they're doing what they're
[39:15.460 --> 39:22.020]  saying i've got stuff microsoft saying even worse we'll come back with but here he is a possibly
[39:22.020 --> 39:28.020]  addressed really big world problems through human engineering another example is and you go first
[39:29.620 --> 39:36.100]  and another example is sort of and here i'll go first right uh you'll see that i'm the smallest
[39:36.100 --> 39:45.540]  person here right and well um yeah so it turns out that the larger you are think of the lifetime
[39:45.540 --> 39:50.420]  sort of greenhouse gas emissions that are required to sort of the energy that's required to transport
[39:50.420 --> 39:58.100]  larger people rather than smaller people right but before smaller just by 15 centimeters right
[39:58.100 --> 40:03.620]  that's a mass you know i did the math and it's about mass reduction of 25 percent which is huge
[40:03.620 --> 40:08.180]  and a hundred years ago we're all on the average smaller about oh well and you're the big global
[40:08.180 --> 40:14.420]  group that's going to decide how tall we are wow this isn't a nightmare situation and it's all in
[40:14.420 --> 40:18.820]  brave new world and you're like well that's just fiction you know huxley said it's a real plan by the
[40:18.820 --> 40:24.420]  elites and my brother runs it at the un and it won't be 1984 it'll be brave new world and that's
[40:24.420 --> 40:29.460]  how you live and now they're doing it what a sick evil power trip so they got us fighting
[40:29.460 --> 40:34.900]  over what color we are all this they're ruling the whole future taking over our bodies robbing
[40:34.900 --> 40:41.060]  everything it's it's just so incredible we've got to organize we've got to awaken we've got to mobilize
[40:41.060 --> 40:48.820]  we've got to become aware of all of this we'll be right back oh and we also have a very special
[40:48.820 --> 40:54.500]  guess that's going to be joining us that's it's a very typical spear stay with us
[40:56.900 --> 41:01.860]  info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind that's why i spent our motto for more

[41:18.980 --> 41:25.620]  iodine that you find in food is bound to different minerals and so it's hard for your body to absorb

[45:50.980 --> 45:56.260]  and god said i know you want to save your children i know you want to save all these
[45:56.260 --> 46:02.900]  different innocent people we have to save the whole world to do it and men must sacrifice

[46:28.180 --> 46:32.340]  say the right thing let people know what they're doing is wrong and then not submit to the antichrist
[46:32.340 --> 46:37.700]  takeover imagine if american churches were speaking out against all the things that are happening
[46:38.740 --> 46:43.860]  hardly any of them are it's all manifesting it's all coming to pass it's all happening you hear
[46:43.860 --> 46:50.020]  nothing oh come to church for your injection come to church show your qr code that you're safe
[46:50.020 --> 46:54.660]  social distance the un suddenly is in control of your church just like that
[46:56.340 --> 46:59.460]  i got sent a text message about one of my law enforcement friends this morning
[47:00.180 --> 47:04.980]  they're like wow have you seen cbs news saying the un is now in charge of our immigration
[47:06.100 --> 47:08.340]  and i said uh i didn't see that but i said yeah
[47:08.340 --> 47:15.780]  yeah trump pulled us off the un control of our immigration 2017 and now they put us back under
[47:15.780 --> 47:20.100]  it but i said till trump pulled us off we would tell the public they're like yeah right the un
[47:20.100 --> 47:25.940]  runs our border policy oh they don't just run it you have to register with them and the border
[47:25.940 --> 47:30.100]  patrol basically has to register with them and that's in cbs news today i'll i'll show you that
[47:30.100 --> 47:35.860]  in a moment you understand this isn't hyperbole it sounds like hyperbole when i say in the new
[47:35.860 --> 47:41.780]  official government threat assessment the main enemy is the american people
[47:44.740 --> 47:48.660]  and if you don't like lockdowns or forced inoculations you are a white supremacist
[47:49.220 --> 47:53.620]  you know what the hell does that have to do with it nothing they call you a white supremacist
[47:53.620 --> 47:57.620]  they say that's the main terror threat you're a terrorist and now somebody says why would my
[47:57.620 --> 48:01.380]  neighbor hold away because they're against forced inoculation oh you're a white supremacist too
[48:01.380 --> 48:08.980]  and the wolf marble they just want to guillotine somebody so as dumb as all this seems to an
[48:08.980 --> 48:14.180]  informed person remember the globalists are targeting the dumbest low information people who
[48:14.180 --> 48:18.180]  have no idea and if they hear that somebody's a white supremacist they believe it so i've always
[48:18.180 --> 48:21.140]  said white supremacists don't deserve to be killed they have a right to their views just so
[48:21.700 --> 48:25.780]  black racist anybody as long as you don't act on it but see now the idea is oh it's okay to punch
[48:25.780 --> 48:32.740]  a nazi then it's okay to kill a nazi well now we're all nazis you see they're not going to call us
[48:32.740 --> 48:35.940]  christians when they're hauling us off to the death camp we're going to be white supremacists
[48:36.740 --> 48:38.500]  because the majority of the world is brown
[48:41.060 --> 48:45.460]  meanwhile the globalists are really killing them just as much or more so let's get into it here's
[48:45.460 --> 48:48.980]  a mainstream article i told you this last week out of the document people didn't believe it
[48:48.980 --> 48:54.020]  they've had media matters articles making fun of us george soros is a tennessee star major paper
[48:54.020 --> 48:58.580]  go by and ask americas to report radicalized friends and family to the government what's
[48:58.580 --> 49:05.060]  radicalization it says protesting inoculations protesting lockdowns that's not in full wars
[49:05.060 --> 49:09.380]  last week telling you the exact same headline finally it's in the news today here's the national
[49:09.380 --> 49:15.620]  strategy for counter countering domestic terrorism incredibly says it's not russia it's not china it's
[49:15.620 --> 49:20.820]  not al-qaeda it's not open borders it's not ms 13 no no ladies and gentlemen it is
[49:20.820 --> 49:29.060]  it is read it for yourself gut owners veterans patriots and then we've got this guy five years
[49:29.060 --> 49:33.460]  ago when the top biologists in the world saying we need to genetically engineer people where they
[49:33.460 --> 49:42.100]  can't eat food and that's done with the vaccine you just simply inject somebody to teach their
[49:42.100 --> 49:47.380]  body to not be able to handle bovine protein then you have an autoimmune response just like
[49:47.380 --> 49:52.820]  these Pfizer shots and Moderna shots and others aren't vaccines their gene therapies that teach
[49:52.820 --> 49:58.580]  your body to attack a spike protein that's on the virus that they added to it that just
[49:58.580 --> 50:04.420]  no happens to be the same protein in your lungs your heart your uterus your ovaries your genitals
[50:05.380 --> 50:09.460]  so they just gave you a shot to make you allergic to yourself so five years ago he goes
[50:09.460 --> 50:15.220]  we'll give you a shot so you don't eat beef or we'll put chemicals in your mother to make you
[50:15.220 --> 50:21.460]  smaller oh just 15 centimeters at first it's always just a little bit well it's for the earth
[50:21.460 --> 50:26.020]  i'm going to let the government genetically engineer my child see how that works they already
[50:26.020 --> 50:30.020]  done it with chemicals in the food and water to make your genitals smaller your sperm count plummet
[50:31.300 --> 50:36.580]  to make girls going to puberty at age five they're assaulting you and they're little
[50:36.580 --> 50:42.740]  twit nerds like dr. Lau and so-called dr. gates who you don't see as threatening
[50:42.740 --> 50:47.860]  and you'd see hulk hogan because your entire genetics is to see a big six foot seven god
[50:47.860 --> 50:52.740]  one where andre the giant you know almost eight feet tall or whatever you see that is threatening
[50:52.740 --> 50:56.820]  because in all your genetic memory that thing coming at you is what's dangerous but not a
[50:56.820 --> 51:00.580]  little guy in a little suit who just wants to make you shorter than him or just once you
[51:00.580 --> 51:05.060]  where you can't eat meat but they're not gonna that's just them getting you used to this they've
[51:05.060 --> 51:13.060]  already hit you now with the thing that sterilizes you and kills you you're already been hit you
[51:13.060 --> 51:16.180]  think the people that have been hit by this are going to complain about it you think they're
[51:16.180 --> 51:21.460]  going to admit they got hit no because they have stock home syndrome so let me finish the clip
[51:21.460 --> 51:26.820]  but then i only got the part of here this possibly address really big role problems
[51:26.820 --> 51:34.260]  through human engineering another example is and you go first yeah and another example is sort of
[51:34.260 --> 51:41.380]  and here i'll go first right you'll see that i'm the smallest person here right and well
[51:44.420 --> 51:50.100]  so it turns out that the larger you are think of the lifetime sort of greenhouse gas emissions
[51:50.100 --> 51:54.660]  that are required to sort of the energy that's required to transform larger people rather than
[51:54.660 --> 52:02.500]  smaller people right but if we're smaller just by 15 centimeters right that's a mass you know
[52:02.500 --> 52:07.620]  i did the math and it's about mass reduction of 25 percent which is huge and a hundred years ago
[52:07.620 --> 52:13.460]  we're all on the average smaller about 50 exactly about 15 centimeters smaller right so think of
[52:13.460 --> 52:18.660]  just the you know like lifetime greenhouse gas emissions if we had smaller children right and
[52:18.660 --> 52:23.540]  so that's something that we could do through some sort of human could we like setting so i'll give
[52:23.540 --> 52:29.700]  two examples so one is that people eat too much meat right and if they were to cut down on their
[52:29.700 --> 52:35.540]  consumption on meat then they would it would actually really help the planet but people are
[52:35.540 --> 52:39.860]  not willing to give up meat yeah you know some people will be willing to but other people
[52:39.860 --> 52:43.860]  they may be willing to but they sort of they have a weakness of well they say wow this this
[52:43.860 --> 52:49.620]  steak is just too juicy i can't do it i'm one of those by the way so you know but so here's a thought
[52:49.620 --> 52:55.940]  right so it turns out that we know a lot about so there we have these intolerance to so i for
[52:55.940 --> 53:01.780]  example i have milk intolerance some and there some people are intolerant to crayfish so possibly
[53:01.780 --> 53:06.900]  we can use human engineering to make it the case that we're intolerant to certain kinds of meat
[53:06.900 --> 53:13.140]  to certain kinds of bovine protein and there's actually oh back in a few seconds yeah a like
[53:13.140 --> 53:16.740]  you've done to make us allergic to ourselves and all the top scientists that weren't part of this
[53:16.740 --> 53:21.140]  said this will make people attack their own bodies it'll make us have heart attacks it'll make us have
[53:21.140 --> 53:25.380]  strokes make the lungs bleed out and make a sterile and now we know it's happening but they
[53:25.380 --> 53:31.060]  control big tech they control the media they control the hospitals and they're just just saying hey it
[53:31.060 --> 53:37.780]  is the way it is we're gonna gaslight you we're gonna save the earth just like they did in that
[53:37.780 --> 53:44.580]  2013 show utopia we made last year about they hype up the fear of a virus you take the vaccine
[53:44.580 --> 53:49.700]  it sterilizes it for three generations and one of the white papers now say for at least three
[53:49.700 --> 53:55.780]  generations this is going to sterilize everybody the text that it'll pass this autoimmune disorder
[53:55.780 --> 54:04.100]  on to the next generation you see how it is to get hit by a high-tech weapon we're in the year 2021
[54:07.620 --> 54:11.460]  my god then of course google was running the will hand lab to kill you and your family
[54:12.340 --> 54:15.140]  that's who they are and all you that work for google pretend like you're not part of everybody
[54:15.140 --> 54:20.580]  you work for microsoft you work for them but don't pretend and think they're not going to get you to
[54:20.580 --> 54:26.900]  don't pretend like you're immune from all this let's finish the clip up make it the case that
[54:26.900 --> 54:31.860]  we're intolerant to certain kinds of meat to certain kinds of bovine protein and there's
[54:31.860 --> 54:36.580]  actually analogs of this in line there's this thing called the long-star tick where if it bites
[54:36.580 --> 54:41.700]  you you will become allergic to meat i can sort of describe the mechanism so that's something
[54:41.700 --> 54:46.580]  how we can do it through human engineering we can kind of possibly address really big world
[54:46.580 --> 54:53.620]  problems through human engineering another human engineering why do we laugh at alex jones
[54:53.620 --> 55:02.340]  against sincere question all right so let's talk about this he says we can do that so we should do
[55:02.340 --> 55:08.020]  it well i could walk up to him i mean i'm not going to with a hatchet and say you know it's science
[55:08.020 --> 55:12.100]  that if i hit you in the head with this hatchet going 100 miles an hour when i swing my fist
[55:12.100 --> 55:15.380]  and i split your skull open you're gonna die and that's less people that saves the earth
[55:15.380 --> 55:20.740]  so i'm allowed to go kill him with a hatchet now because there's too many people i play god
[55:20.740 --> 55:26.100]  i know science and this hatchet's gonna kill him oh no no that's too direct too bloody too obvious
[55:26.100 --> 55:30.980]  you need to die slowly that the hospital system he and other biologists just run suck everything
[55:30.980 --> 55:35.220]  out of your family then they'll be the heroes while they kill you you don't do it with a hatchet
[55:35.220 --> 55:40.340]  all quick and bloody i know you do it elegantly and murderously and sneakily like this little
[55:40.340 --> 55:49.540]  bastards talking about people pat me on the back all the time and i really really appreciate it
[55:49.540 --> 55:54.900]  but i want you to understand something don't put the horse in front of the cart here don't put the

[58:07.140 --> 58:10.580]  all right we've got a lady who's been at the tip of the spear when it comes to exposing
[58:10.580 --> 58:16.260]  election fraud that is uh really been documented is being rolled out now joining us coming up next
[58:16.260 --> 58:20.740]  segment she's testified around the country looks like rudy juliani so we look forward to talking
[58:20.740 --> 58:26.660]  to her here in a moment look this is a scientific takeover by people that have decided to be long
[58:26.660 --> 58:32.980]  term very manipulative very psychotic but if you just recognize their plan and don't comply
[58:32.980 --> 58:38.900]  with their different phases of operations successive approximation their plan can be easily
[58:38.900 --> 58:45.060]  defeated with non-compliance but you got to start doing it now before they really get you in the
[58:45.060 --> 58:49.940]  news so i have a plug yet today and i need to plug right now we're not going to be on air any longer
[58:51.060 --> 58:55.140]  ladies and gentlemen this plug to keep info wars on the air is extremely important
[58:55.940 --> 59:00.580]  but also the story behind what's unfolding affects not just this broadcast but it's going to affect
[59:00.580 --> 59:06.020]  you and your family we've had major supply chain problems a lot of our best-selling products because
[59:06.020 --> 59:09.620]  they are high-grade they have a lot of different ingredients in them especially the supplements
[59:09.620 --> 59:13.620]  because we won't adulterate our products or cut back the quality many of our best-selling products
[59:13.620 --> 59:18.500]  have not been available for almost six seven eight nine ten months and that has crippled info wars
[59:19.060 --> 59:24.980]  when it comes to being able to fund our operation and what we're doing but talking to major suppliers
[59:24.980 --> 59:31.060]  they're being bought up by multinational corporations at 20 30 40 100 times what they
[59:31.060 --> 59:37.940]  should even be worth they are consolidating with the trillions and quadrillions of money
[59:37.940 --> 59:44.100]  that these multinational mega corporations have to buy up everything so they're compartmentalizing
[59:44.100 --> 59:49.140]  the inflation of all this fiat currency made to buying up the infrastructure so that visible
[59:49.140 --> 59:54.020]  inflation the general public is not as bad but it's still creeping up very very fast and it's
[59:54.020 --> 1:00:00.420]  going to balloon later but when you get into the economics of this and and just the real world
[1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:08.180]  numbers of it it is so diabolical because they're passing on all the massive cost when they buy
[1:00:08.180 --> 1:00:13.300]  up these companies to you the consumer on top of all the money printing on top of all the stimulus
[1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:20.420]  money and on top of the lockdowns that have made the actual items much much more scarce so this
[1:00:20.420 --> 1:00:26.580]  is an incredible time to be alive and it is devastating the small economy the local economy
[1:00:26.580 --> 1:00:31.060]  support the local economy support the independent economy now more than ever because
[1:00:31.060 --> 1:00:36.900]  this is economic warfare i was told by major suppliers in the last month but i talked to some
[1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:43.060]  this morning that big box stores you know the names are and amazon are buying everything up for
[1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:47.780]  whatever it cost to corner the market to where their competition can't even operate and then
[1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:52.020]  once that's done they can jack up prices so that's where we are a lot of our best-selling
[1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:56.180]  products are sold out uh then we can't sell our regular items at discounted prices that's what
[1:00:56.180 --> 1:01:01.780]  we have in stock so please just go to infoarstore.com today you see a big banner saying become a sponsor
[1:01:01.780 --> 1:01:06.980]  give give five dollars give twenty dollars give a hundred dollars sign up for an auto gift uh so
[1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:12.020]  that you don't forget you can cancel anytime but we do need funding one way or another so i'm really

[1:01:40.660 --> 1:01:45.860]  to come out with so it will end today because those items are getting very very low in supply
[1:01:45.860 --> 1:01:50.420]  they're going to go back to a regular price uh tomorrow morning so the mega immune support
[1:01:50.420 --> 1:01:54.580]  packs a great product for your body your immune system everybody needs it you have until tomorrow
[1:01:54.580 --> 1:02:00.500]  morning to get that in and then for another week or so ultimate high-end krill oil for your heart
[1:02:00.500 --> 1:02:06.260]  your brain your whole body back in stock 40 off x3 sold out for a long time back in stock we got a
[1:02:06.260 --> 1:02:11.060]  big shipment of that in i want you to experience tri iodine the opposite of fluoride the globalist
[1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:14.740]  do not want you having good clean iodine you actually absorb it's amazing for adults so
[1:02:14.740 --> 1:02:19.780]  when you name it powerful stuff learn about the iodine conspiracy it's 60 percent off
[1:02:19.780 --> 1:02:23.540]  because i want you to get it but that's going to last for only a week that will be gone by
[1:02:23.540 --> 1:02:31.140]  next week and then of course we have the bio tree selenium mustard seed super strong electrochemical
[1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:35.700]  action your body must have it it's essential it's the strongest you're going to find out there
[1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:39.620]  you talk about energy you can take all the caffeine you want all day long you don't have the selenium
[1:02:39.620 --> 1:02:43.620]  and other things you need it's not going to work because you're missing out on that basic
[1:02:43.620 --> 1:02:49.300]  ingredient that's essential it's 50 percent off info or store dot com that keeps me here
[1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:56.980]  want to thank you all for your support the scientific dictatorship that i've been warning
[1:02:56.980 --> 1:03:03.060]  you about for 27 years has now gone for beta testing to operational the globalists are out
[1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:08.660]  of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover but the good news is
[1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:12.340]  we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for
[1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:18.100]  decades to get ready for this to be able to find it on humanity is strong we're incredible and if
[1:03:18.100 --> 1:03:22.500]  we're aware of the attack that's happening we have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for
[1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:27.940]  guidance we will defeat it so prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared is essential
[1:03:27.940 --> 1:03:33.620]  and warning others is absolutely essential and at the same time supporting info wars by buying
[1:03:33.620 --> 1:03:37.460]  high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your
[1:03:37.460 --> 1:03:44.260]  family and they're also funding our operation info wars store dot com info wars store dot com
[1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:47.940]  is incredible a lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns
[1:03:47.940 --> 1:03:52.740]  are back in like bodies mazo beats and others so get them today at info wars store dot com and i
[1:03:52.740 --> 1:04:12.100]  thank you for being part of the resistance big brother mainstream media government cover-up
[1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:20.500]  you want to stop tyranny will so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex
[1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:33.540]  jones so they've been preparing a globalist cashless society mark of the beast system where
[1:04:33.540 --> 1:04:40.180]  they take over our bodies and reprogram us and merge us with the system and now the horsemen
[1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:47.780]  aren't just drawing nearer the four horsemen are here and this is going to be a big decision point
[1:04:47.780 --> 1:04:52.340]  for all of humanity we have a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour who's been
[1:04:52.340 --> 1:04:57.940]  helping spearhead investigations of election fraud that is coming up and i and i've got the huge
[1:04:57.940 --> 1:05:04.180]  covid news the big democrat attempt to take over the elections and federalize them that barely
[1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:08.260]  failed which would scare the hell out of people i'm going to be hitting that next segment but i
[1:05:08.260 --> 1:05:12.820]  wanted to go to some of these reports that john bounds been putting out there's so many of them
[1:05:12.820 --> 1:05:21.620]  so many of them leave your coven cave is very powerful um also uh you you have the power and
[1:05:21.620 --> 1:05:28.340]  other pc put out that's really gonna fire people up let's play leave your coven cave first and
[1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:33.940]  then back to back we'll air his next report you have the power so leave your coven cave this is
[1:05:33.940 --> 1:05:41.460]  the type of stuff posted at band dot video and info wars dot com hope you share it the pandemic has
[1:05:41.460 --> 1:05:47.300]  increased and the hospital has almost every patient who comes into the hospital has covid 19
[1:05:47.300 --> 1:05:52.580]  with no family by their side for support this is someone who's looks like they're pretty sick into
[1:05:52.580 --> 1:05:56.980]  the emergency room i'm calling their families i'm letting them know how bad this is at the peak of
[1:05:56.980 --> 1:06:03.220]  the pandemic boston medical center filled nearly two-thirds of its beds with those infected with
[1:06:03.220 --> 1:06:10.580]  the chinese bio weapon and now there are exactly zero covid 19 patients the covid count in florida
[1:06:10.580 --> 1:06:13.900]  is at its lowest despite only half of Floridians
[1:06:13.900 --> 1:06:17.660]  being vaccinated and all restrictions lifted far earlier
[1:06:17.660 --> 1:06:20.940]  than blue states where the lockdowns reign supreme.
[1:06:20.940 --> 1:06:23.460]  Today, Florida's governor granted a full pardon
[1:06:23.460 --> 1:06:25.940]  to anyone who violated local COVID rules
[1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:28.020]  like social distancing or mask mandates.
[1:06:28.020 --> 1:06:30.380]  The carnival's feeling vindicated Wednesday.
[1:06:30.380 --> 1:06:32.780]  The plantation gym owners now fully pardoned
[1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.580]  after several arrests last year,
[1:06:34.580 --> 1:06:37.660]  Mike repeatedly disobeying Broward County's mask order.
[1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:39.460]  Falling on the sword was something I had to do
[1:06:39.460 --> 1:06:42.340]  in Broward County for the greater good of Florida.
[1:06:42.340 --> 1:06:43.780]  I was more than happy to do that.
[1:06:43.780 --> 1:06:46.740]  The couple felt masks were impractical in gyms
[1:06:46.740 --> 1:06:49.060]  and a violation of individual liberties.
[1:06:49.060 --> 1:06:50.980]  Governor Ron DeSantis agreeing,
[1:06:50.980 --> 1:06:53.500]  granting that pardon during a clemency meeting.
[1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:55.180]  So motion carries.
[1:06:55.180 --> 1:06:56.020]  Thank you guys.
[1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:57.780]  Sorry about what happened.
[1:06:57.780 --> 1:06:59.380]  It applies not just to them,
[1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:01.300]  but every nonviolent Floridian
[1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:03.620]  who broke similar COVID ordinances.
[1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:05.020]  Yay!
[1:07:05.020 --> 1:07:06.740]  The Republicans saying the rules
[1:07:06.740 --> 1:07:08.500]  have gotten in the way of recovery.
[1:07:08.500 --> 1:07:11.220]  We just want to say, we've got to stop that.
[1:07:11.220 --> 1:07:13.140]  Let's focus on the real criminals
[1:07:13.140 --> 1:07:15.500]  and let's make sure that that's where our effort is.
[1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:19.620]  What CDC has done by closing the cruise industry
[1:07:19.620 --> 1:07:20.580]  for over a year,
[1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:22.660]  they do not have the authority to do it.
[1:07:22.660 --> 1:07:25.060]  A federal judge in Florida recently ruled
[1:07:25.060 --> 1:07:27.020]  that the Center for Disease Control
[1:07:27.020 --> 1:07:30.260]  and Prevention's coronavirus-era sailing orders
[1:07:30.260 --> 1:07:32.020]  were an overreach of power,
[1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:36.660]  issuing a preliminary injunction temporarily barring the CDC
[1:07:36.660 --> 1:07:38.700]  from enforcing those guidelines.
[1:07:38.700 --> 1:07:40.740]  We're taking in the cruise capital world,
[1:07:40.740 --> 1:07:43.620]  exciting news, and what this is going to do
[1:07:43.620 --> 1:07:45.620]  is support jobs, jobs, jobs.
[1:07:45.620 --> 1:07:47.500]  Governor DeSantis called Friday's ruling
[1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:49.500]  a major victory against the CDC
[1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:52.460]  in their obstructionist no-sail orders.
[1:07:52.460 --> 1:07:54.580]  The injunction stays until July 18th
[1:07:54.580 --> 1:07:57.340]  when the CDC's orders will be considered recommendations
[1:07:57.340 --> 1:08:00.220]  or guidelines the judge is saying in this order.
[1:08:00.220 --> 1:08:01.740]  And according to the CDC,
[1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:05.180]  the current seven-day moving average of daily new cases
[1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:07.180]  has decreased, but you wouldn't know it
[1:08:07.180 --> 1:08:09.260]  listening to the Legion of Doom.
[1:08:09.260 --> 1:08:12.100]  This is concerning because the variant
[1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:15.220]  has been demonstrated to be more transmissible,
[1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:20.220]  more easily spread than the original COVID-19 virus,
[1:08:21.460 --> 1:08:23.700]  and it has potentially been shown
[1:08:23.700 --> 1:08:26.580]  to lead to more severe disease
[1:08:26.580 --> 1:08:30.060]  and disease that actually progresses more quickly,
[1:08:30.060 --> 1:08:32.180]  leading to more hospitalizations.
[1:08:32.180 --> 1:08:34.620]  Meanwhile, United Nations' tool,
[1:08:34.620 --> 1:08:37.100]  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
[1:08:37.100 --> 1:08:39.460]  announced that non-essential travel
[1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:41.020]  between the U.S. and Canada
[1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:43.420]  will continue to be banned for another month
[1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:45.980]  despite mounting pressure from businesses
[1:08:45.980 --> 1:08:49.180]  to ease COVID-19 travel restrictions.
[1:08:49.180 --> 1:08:51.100]  We'll provide that information to the provinces
[1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:52.700]  and territories right away
[1:08:52.700 --> 1:08:54.500]  so that they can plan to get those doses
[1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:56.780]  into arms as quickly as possible,
[1:08:56.780 --> 1:08:59.060]  because that's what this is about,
[1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:02.300]  getting you your vaccine as soon as possible,
[1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:05.260]  getting it to your parents, friends, and neighbors,
[1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:08.140]  because every dose keeps someone safe.
[1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:10.420]  It has turned out to be more of a serious issue
[1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:11.460]  than previously thought.
[1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:13.420]  We're talking about myocarditis
[1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:15.180]  happening to some young people
[1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:17.420]  after getting the coronavirus vaccine,
[1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:19.700]  both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
[1:09:19.700 --> 1:09:21.660]  The CDC is looking into it.
[1:09:21.660 --> 1:09:23.580]  While California has announced
[1:09:23.580 --> 1:09:26.660]  an Orwellian digital vaccine record system,
[1:09:26.660 --> 1:09:29.300]  as the vaccinated and unvaccinated
[1:09:29.300 --> 1:09:31.300]  continue to be segregated
[1:09:31.300 --> 1:09:33.060]  by the powers that be.
[1:09:33.060 --> 1:09:34.540]  But if you are vaccinated,
[1:09:34.540 --> 1:09:36.020]  what do you have to worry about?
[1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:38.860]  In the words of Buffalo Bill's wide receiver,
[1:09:38.860 --> 1:09:39.860]  Cole Beasley,
[1:09:39.860 --> 1:09:41.100]  I'm not vaccinated.
[1:09:41.100 --> 1:09:43.620]  I will be outside doing what I do.
[1:09:43.620 --> 1:09:45.260]  I'll be out in the public.
[1:09:45.260 --> 1:09:46.460]  If you're scared of me,
[1:09:46.460 --> 1:09:49.060]  then steer clear or get vaccinated.
[1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:50.820]  Point blank, period.
[1:09:50.820 --> 1:09:52.220]  John Bown reporting.
[1:09:54.500 --> 1:09:55.900]  All right, that's one of the reports.
[1:09:55.900 --> 1:09:58.540]  Now, I haven't gotten to the COVID news
[1:09:58.540 --> 1:09:59.700]  and it's really bad
[1:09:59.700 --> 1:10:01.300]  and it's what we knew was gonna happen.
[1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:02.380]  They take the restrictions off
[1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:03.500]  for just a few weeks or months,
[1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:05.060]  clamping right back down,
[1:10:05.060 --> 1:10:06.660]  and that's what the UN is announcing.
[1:10:06.660 --> 1:10:07.940]  And you're like, well, screw the UN.
[1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:08.780]  Well, exactly.
[1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:10.940]  And that's why they either go down
[1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:11.780]  or we go down.
[1:10:11.780 --> 1:10:12.620]  I'll be talking about it,
[1:10:12.620 --> 1:10:14.540]  but I wanna hit something right now
[1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:16.940]  because I just wanna let you guys understand this.
[1:10:18.980 --> 1:10:20.620]  Info wars almost had to lay off
[1:10:20.620 --> 1:10:23.220]  a bunch of people in 2019.
[1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:27.420]  And we just didn't even have the money
[1:10:27.420 --> 1:10:30.540]  to buy enough product to be able to get the product.
[1:10:30.540 --> 1:10:32.140]  But I made a few moves,
[1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:33.140]  never done this in my life,
[1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:34.660]  went into debt to get money,
[1:10:34.660 --> 1:10:36.300]  to buy enough product.
[1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:37.500]  And you guys bought the product
[1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:39.300]  and we got out of the hole in 2020.
[1:10:40.940 --> 1:10:44.180]  Then we got to where we can't ever get the supplies
[1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:45.780]  of the products we want to be able to sell them.
[1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:46.860]  So now there's that new problem
[1:10:46.860 --> 1:10:48.820]  and it's destroying a lot of businesses,
[1:10:48.820 --> 1:10:49.660]  half the businesses,
[1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:51.340]  and you know when the country went out of business,
[1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:52.820]  that's why they wanna keep the lockdowns going
[1:10:52.820 --> 1:10:54.460]  to destroy the small businesses.
[1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:55.660]  Well, my business is freedom,
[1:10:55.660 --> 1:10:58.140]  but I have you as a sponsor buying products
[1:10:58.140 --> 1:10:59.460]  that keep us on the air.
[1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:03.540]  And so now we can't get most of the products
[1:11:03.540 --> 1:11:07.180]  like Brainforce and so many others in.
[1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:08.180]  And even when they can do an order,
[1:11:08.180 --> 1:11:11.260]  they go, oh, sorry, we only have this much of the material.
[1:11:11.260 --> 1:11:12.460]  Now I've learned what's going on.
[1:11:12.460 --> 1:11:15.180]  Almost all the companies we use have been bought up.
[1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:17.060]  And we learned the companies that bought them up
[1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:20.020]  then sell their whole inventory to other companies
[1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:22.820]  that are in Walmart, Target, and Amazon,
[1:11:22.820 --> 1:11:25.620]  which is extremely monopolistic.
[1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:27.820]  And so I guess we could call this Operation T-Shirt.
[1:11:27.820 --> 1:11:28.660]  I don't know what to call it,
[1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:32.060]  but I don't like right on the red, right on the black.
[1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:34.500]  When I got a lot of stuff I wanna do to take
[1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:36.100]  on the new world order and a lot of people I wanna hire,
[1:11:36.100 --> 1:11:37.500]  I wanna go on the offense, man.
[1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:38.900]  People are ready.
[1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:40.660]  The world's waking up that I've been dead on.
[1:11:40.660 --> 1:11:42.940]  You've supported us, you've been dead on.
[1:11:42.940 --> 1:11:45.580]  So I guess you call it Operation T-Shirt?
[1:11:45.580 --> 1:11:46.420]  Cause I get it.
[1:11:46.420 --> 1:11:48.380]  You buy official cause it works great.
[1:11:48.380 --> 1:11:50.380]  You buy Turboforces, it works great.
[1:11:50.380 --> 1:11:52.140]  You buy X2 cause it works great.
[1:11:52.140 --> 1:11:53.780]  You buy the things you reuse.
[1:11:53.780 --> 1:11:55.340]  You buy our coffee, it's great coffee.
[1:11:55.340 --> 1:11:57.860]  You remember to buy it, it's great.
[1:11:57.860 --> 1:11:59.740]  But then when I can't supply it to you,
[1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:02.620]  this is the most trouble we've been in so far
[1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:04.300]  because I'm right here in the middle of the economy.
[1:12:04.300 --> 1:12:05.140]  Let's do a show.
[1:12:05.140 --> 1:12:06.260]  I gotta fund this operation.
[1:12:06.260 --> 1:12:08.860]  So I'm experiencing, it's actually good
[1:12:08.860 --> 1:12:12.180]  cause I get to see what's really going on the world
[1:12:12.180 --> 1:12:13.580]  and how devastating it is.
[1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:14.900]  So we have some new shirts.
[1:12:14.900 --> 1:12:17.500]  The Save the Frog shirt, infowars.com
[1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:18.700]  exposing what's in the water.
[1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:19.860]  It's a great conversation piece.
[1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:21.220]  It's the best seller.
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:22.660]  We sold 5,000 of them.
[1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:24.220]  For a T-Shirt, that's great in a month.
[1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:25.900]  That doesn't fund this operation.
[1:12:25.900 --> 1:12:27.380]  I sold them like 50 bucks it would.
[1:12:27.380 --> 1:12:28.700]  Maybe I should go up.
[1:12:28.700 --> 1:12:31.140]  But you know, 1776 it doesn't.
[1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:32.580]  We need to sell more of these.
[1:12:33.460 --> 1:12:36.140]  Also, we have the new free American shirt.
[1:12:36.140 --> 1:12:39.540]  Big, beautiful American flag in camo, in navy blue
[1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:40.500]  and in black.
[1:12:41.700 --> 1:12:44.020]  On the back it says infowars.com.
[1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:45.740]  This is very triggering the leftist.
[1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:47.260]  They hate this.
[1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:48.540]  They're gonna have it at the Olympics.
[1:12:48.540 --> 1:12:51.700]  The new Olympic player, transgender US Olympic BMX rider
[1:12:51.700 --> 1:12:54.020]  says his goals, it's now her,
[1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:57.380]  is to burn the US flag on the Olympic podium.
[1:12:57.380 --> 1:12:59.580]  So we need to champion the flag
[1:12:59.580 --> 1:13:00.700]  and it funds the info war.
[1:13:00.700 --> 1:13:04.340]  Everyone should get a free American shirt on the back.
[1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:06.900]  It has the classic info war square
[1:13:06.900 --> 1:13:08.580]  to help spread the word.
[1:13:08.580 --> 1:13:10.420]  So infowars.com.
[1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:12.820]  It has a big, beautiful American flag across the chest.
[1:13:12.820 --> 1:13:16.380]  It simply says free American in camo, in navy blue
[1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:18.180]  and in black, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:13:18.180 --> 1:13:19.820]  They are trying to take our country over.
[1:13:19.820 --> 1:13:21.540]  They're trying to shut down the independent media.
[1:13:21.540 --> 1:13:22.380]  And here's the news.
[1:13:22.380 --> 1:13:24.220]  I can't get a lot of the supplements,
[1:13:24.220 --> 1:13:26.620]  but I can get t-shirts.
[1:13:26.620 --> 1:13:28.020]  So that's why it's operation t-shirt.
[1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:31.020]  And I'm just hoping that we can sell
[1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:34.620]  tens of thousands of t-shirts to fund this operation.
[1:13:34.620 --> 1:13:36.860]  Because in 1776, these are high quality shirts
[1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:38.420]  made in America, all the rest of it,
[1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:39.260]  and printed in America.
[1:13:39.260 --> 1:13:41.860]  So they're costing us like seven, eight, nine bucks a piece.
[1:13:41.860 --> 1:13:43.580]  I could buy crap shirts for like $5 a piece.
[1:13:43.580 --> 1:13:45.180]  I could buy from China for $2 a piece.
[1:13:45.180 --> 1:13:46.580]  I'm not doing it.
[1:13:46.580 --> 1:13:49.500]  So please get them infowars.com today.
[1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:51.220]  Operation t-shirt, save infowars.
[1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:52.220]  We'll be right back.
[1:13:56.580 --> 1:13:58.660]  Your voice counts.
[1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:01.260]  When you share information, be it over the internet
[1:14:01.260 --> 1:14:03.740]  or in person, it changes the world.
[1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:06.340]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:07.820]  They know you're angry.

[1:14:54.260 --> 1:14:56.900]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep
[1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:58.620]  is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:14:58.620 --> 1:15:01.220]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked
[1:15:01.220 --> 1:15:04.620]  with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory
[1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:07.300]  issues, mood changes, poor concentration,
[1:15:07.300 --> 1:15:09.220]  and even a weakened immune system.
[1:15:09.220 --> 1:15:11.660]  Introducing RocketRest, the new product
[1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:15.420]  from our Dr. Jones naturals line at infowarstore.com.

[1:15:26.580 --> 1:15:28.860]  on getting you to sleep, but RocketRest
[1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:31.820]  was specifically formulated to help you feel rested

[1:15:55.020 --> 1:15:59.260]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[1:15:59.260 --> 1:16:04.580]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[1:16:04.580 --> 1:16:08.500]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas
[1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:13.260]  to date, super male vitality, specifically designed
[1:16:13.260 --> 1:16:16.780]  to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:20.500]  to create superior vitality in males.
[1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:23.900]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's
[1:16:23.900 --> 1:16:28.860]  own natural responses, and it contains no synthetic chemicals
[1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:31.700]  and no unwanted additives.
[1:16:31.700 --> 1:16:34.460]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom
[1:16:34.460 --> 1:16:37.260]  combined with modern technology,
[1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:40.380]  working together in perfect synchronicity
[1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:44.100]  to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[1:16:44.100 --> 1:16:45.220]  So what are you waiting for?
[1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:47.060]  Go to the infowarstore.
[1:16:47.060 --> 1:16:49.740]  Never been a better time than right now.
[1:16:49.740 --> 1:16:53.580]  Super male vitality at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:53.580 --> 1:17:05.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:30.380]  Everybody knows that I love to talk.
[1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:34.500]  But the COVID news I have in front of me is so insane.
[1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:39.060]  So over the top, so powerful, that if I just
[1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:43.220]  release this information, it'll have almost no effect.
[1:17:43.220 --> 1:17:46.180]  But if I make a big deal about it and build it up
[1:17:46.180 --> 1:17:49.740]  and did, say, a special show tomorrow night,
[1:17:49.740 --> 1:17:52.220]  we'd have a couple million extra viewers tune in,
[1:17:52.220 --> 1:17:55.300]  and it'd be being talked about in a week
[1:17:55.300 --> 1:17:57.260]  on big national talk shows, and then you'd
[1:17:57.260 --> 1:18:00.540]  have congressional hearings about it a week later.
[1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:04.220]  But if I just report this, it'll go out to a couple million
[1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:06.540]  listeners, and people just kind of pick it up
[1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:08.500]  like it's par for the course, which I get.
[1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:10.340]  I'm not criticizing anybody.
[1:18:10.340 --> 1:18:12.060]  I understand human psychology.
[1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.700]  I've lived it.
[1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:15.620]  But nevertheless, there isn't time for that,
[1:18:15.620 --> 1:18:17.940]  because I don't know how long we'll be here.
[1:18:17.940 --> 1:18:21.060]  So let me go ahead and just hit this for you now.
[1:18:21.060 --> 1:18:25.540]  And when I read this article that just went up like 30 minutes
[1:18:25.540 --> 1:18:28.700]  ago on infowarstore.com during the last few breaks,
[1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:30.020]  it was like a punch in the stomach,
[1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:34.700]  because every damn bit of it is true.
[1:18:34.700 --> 1:18:39.220]  And every damn bit of it links to all the stuff they've done.
[1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:43.020]  And that's the point is that it's total proof that we
[1:18:43.020 --> 1:18:45.180]  have every angle.
[1:18:45.180 --> 1:18:49.220]  It's not like I just read this and go, oh, is this accurate?
[1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:51.700]  We already know all about the pieces.
[1:18:51.700 --> 1:18:55.140]  It's just another angle of what they did to us.
[1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.300]  If you saw a video of, say, your mother having her brains
[1:18:58.300 --> 1:19:01.700]  beat out with a hammer, and you saw a surveillance footage
[1:19:01.700 --> 1:19:05.500]  from, say, 20 feet in front, and when a thug kills your mother,
[1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:07.460]  somebody goes, oh, I've got another angle.
[1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:08.260]  OK, let me see.
[1:19:08.260 --> 1:19:11.100]  I hate to see it, but I want to know the thug.
[1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:12.540]  And then all of a sudden, you realize
[1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:14.140]  that you've been shown about 20 angles,
[1:19:14.140 --> 1:19:16.060]  that the person showing you the footage
[1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:19.300]  is the person that did it.
[1:19:19.300 --> 1:19:20.580]  And then what do you want to do?
[1:19:20.580 --> 1:19:22.820]  You want to break their neck.
[1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:24.020]  Because, I mean, this is real.
[1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:25.300]  I mean, they're really killing us.
[1:19:25.300 --> 1:19:26.500]  They're really poisoning us.
[1:19:26.500 --> 1:19:28.900]  They're really attacking us, and they're really
[1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:31.260]  messing with my family right now, too, off record,
[1:19:31.260 --> 1:19:32.380]  behind the scenes.
[1:19:32.380 --> 1:19:34.460]  And because they know they're losing,
[1:19:34.460 --> 1:19:35.860]  and they want to trick us into a fight,
[1:19:35.860 --> 1:19:38.940]  and they're using psychology on us.
[1:19:38.940 --> 1:19:40.060]  They were really smart.
[1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:42.420]  One of these videos I've got that's on infowars.com,
[1:19:42.420 --> 1:19:46.420]  where they have transgenderism and critical race theory
[1:19:46.420 --> 1:19:47.260]  coming into school.
[1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:48.780]  And they're at least the five-year-olds
[1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:51.020]  that they need to have their genitals cut off.
[1:19:51.020 --> 1:19:54.660]  And it's in Virginia, so some of the moms and people get up.
[1:19:54.660 --> 1:19:55.820]  But they're not allowed to talk.
[1:19:55.820 --> 1:19:58.980]  Oh, no, we're only going to let the people calling you
[1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:01.100]  hate-mongers and calling you devils.
[1:20:01.100 --> 1:20:05.340]  They let all the anti-human people,
[1:20:05.340 --> 1:20:08.020]  all the Satan's little helper collaborators,
[1:20:08.020 --> 1:20:12.220]  get up there and speak first, until the crowd got uppity
[1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:14.420]  and yelled and screamed over them,
[1:20:14.420 --> 1:20:18.060]  and then the police brutally assaulted the peaceful people
[1:20:18.060 --> 1:20:20.460]  and shut down the whole event.
[1:20:20.460 --> 1:20:22.820]  And that's going to be the formula everywhere.
[1:20:22.820 --> 1:20:24.580]  The cops grabbing people.
[1:20:24.580 --> 1:20:27.100]  Let me tell you, everybody lionizes the police.
[1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:28.660]  When the left gets control of your police,
[1:20:28.660 --> 1:20:32.700]  they're now North Korean prison guards.
[1:20:32.700 --> 1:20:34.940]  They're now captured in the hands of the enemy.
[1:20:34.940 --> 1:20:37.580]  They want to prove themselves the system.
[1:20:37.580 --> 1:20:40.940]  Violence against the Christian, violence against the patriot,
[1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:42.580]  violence against a pregnant woman,
[1:20:42.580 --> 1:20:45.820]  violence against a gun owner, violence against a conservative,
[1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:47.980]  that will be glorified and supported
[1:20:47.980 --> 1:20:54.580]  by the media and the police in areas they control.
[1:20:54.580 --> 1:20:56.860]  And they come and they say, we're getting access
[1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:57.860]  to your children.
[1:20:57.860 --> 1:20:59.860]  We're going to teach them that white kids are bad.
[1:20:59.860 --> 1:21:02.260]  We're going to teach your son, his gentle should be cut off.
[1:21:02.260 --> 1:21:04.260]  We're going to teach your little girl that she's a boy.
[1:21:04.260 --> 1:21:06.060]  We're going to form a relationship with them.
[1:21:06.060 --> 1:21:10.260]  And if you try to say no and don't go along with it,
[1:21:10.260 --> 1:21:14.220]  we are going to put you in prison.
[1:21:14.220 --> 1:21:19.660]  And that's all any of this is.
[1:21:19.660 --> 1:21:22.220]  So let me give you the big niche.
[1:21:22.220 --> 1:21:27.660]  You know Google, and you know Apple, and you know Bill Gates,
[1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:30.180]  and you know Fauci Rand, the Wuhan lab.
[1:21:30.180 --> 1:21:30.700]  You know that.
[1:21:30.700 --> 1:21:33.180]  You know every major scientist that comes out from there
[1:21:33.180 --> 1:21:35.180]  is a transhumanist that wants to get rid of humans
[1:21:35.180 --> 1:21:38.020]  or murders with machines like the guy we just played last hour
[1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:40.540]  saying we're going to make you short and make you sick if you
[1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:42.540]  eat meat by changing your genetics.
[1:21:42.540 --> 1:21:45.140]  You have an autoimmune response with a vaccine
[1:21:45.140 --> 1:21:48.740]  to make you allergic to cow.
[1:21:48.740 --> 1:21:50.020]  To bovine.
[1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:52.180]  Well, how about this article by Kevin McBreen
[1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:56.260]  up on infowars.com.
[1:21:56.260 --> 1:21:58.020]  I was in New York walking around,
[1:21:58.020 --> 1:22:00.380]  and I should probably shoot 500 hands.
[1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:02.180]  Most folks were fans.
[1:22:02.180 --> 1:22:04.940]  But I had one lady walk up to me and say to me,
[1:22:04.940 --> 1:22:08.780]  why don't you cover the viral shedding, Mr. Jones?
[1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:09.780]  I've tuned into your show.
[1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:11.420]  Why don't you cover the viral shedding?
[1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:14.660]  We covered the viral shedding first.
[1:22:14.660 --> 1:22:16.140]  So just because you tuned into the show
[1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:18.820]  and don't hear it being talked about at that particular moment
[1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:25.980]  does not mean that we haven't covered it.
[1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:29.260]  Like, Jones used to cover the Federal Reserve being private.
[1:22:29.260 --> 1:22:31.020]  I've done that about 10,000 times, sir.
[1:22:31.020 --> 1:22:32.740]  Jones used to talk more about 9-11.
[1:22:32.740 --> 1:22:33.980]  I'm the first guy to expose it.
[1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:36.460]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[1:22:36.460 --> 1:22:41.740]  I just sometimes even are awake people aren't thinking.
[1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:44.220]  But let's just move on from that.
[1:22:44.220 --> 1:22:48.020]  I know I'm going to be hearing about this in a couple weeks.
[1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:53.700]  And I really don't want to hear about this in two weeks.
[1:22:53.700 --> 1:22:55.700]  I want to hear about this tonight.
[1:22:55.700 --> 1:22:57.540]  I want to see other people write about it.
[1:22:57.540 --> 1:22:58.300]  I don't want any credit.
[1:22:58.300 --> 1:22:58.980]  I don't care.
[1:22:58.980 --> 1:23:01.620]  I want to see it promoted all over Twitter and Facebook.
[1:23:01.620 --> 1:23:02.860]  Take our names off of it.
[1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:06.740]  Republish it, say Bilbo Baggins published it.
[1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:07.620]  I don't care.
[1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:09.300]  Whatever you do, get it out.
[1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:10.020]  See?
[1:23:10.020 --> 1:23:15.620]  Comprende, because this is the smoking gun.
[1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:18.060]  In fact, Kellerman brings a great researcher and writer.
[1:23:18.060 --> 1:23:22.660]  But I want the question mark taken off.
[1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:24.740]  It's like, Hitler was Hitler racist.
[1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:25.660]  You don't need a question mark.
[1:23:25.660 --> 1:23:26.700]  Hitler was a racist.
[1:23:29.620 --> 1:23:30.620]  What state come from?
[1:23:30.620 --> 1:23:31.900]  It comes from cows.
[1:23:31.900 --> 1:23:32.860]  Does the left want to ban it?
[1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:33.580]  Yes.
[1:23:33.580 --> 1:23:34.620]  Let's start.
[1:23:34.620 --> 1:23:36.380]  Is drag queen story time wrong?
[1:23:36.380 --> 1:23:38.300]  Yes, it is.
[1:23:38.300 --> 1:23:40.940]  Even your criticizes if you ask, is it wrong?
[1:23:40.940 --> 1:23:42.140]  So here's the article.
[1:23:42.140 --> 1:23:43.140]  Here's the smoking gun.
[1:23:43.140 --> 1:23:44.700]  And after our special guest leaves us,
[1:23:44.700 --> 1:23:49.380]  I'm going to start back up in the next hour on this enchilada.
[1:23:49.380 --> 1:23:51.860]  Because, man, I read this article and it gave me a headache,
[1:23:51.860 --> 1:23:54.860]  because I thought of literally, that's the skill I've got.
[1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:56.580]  It's like, all the data comes up.
[1:23:56.580 --> 1:23:58.500]  You don't really want a fully photographic memory,
[1:23:58.500 --> 1:24:00.300]  because mine's still quasi-photographic.
[1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:03.660]  And so I see something like this, I'm like, 100 things pop up
[1:24:03.660 --> 1:24:05.540]  that backed it up that I already know.
[1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:08.180]  And then I got a headache trying to extrapolate
[1:24:08.180 --> 1:24:09.900]  and how to connect it and say it all to you,
[1:24:09.900 --> 1:24:11.740]  because it's not like it's just one article.
[1:24:11.740 --> 1:24:14.540]  It's just another one sherry on top,
[1:24:14.540 --> 1:24:16.180]  straw that breaks the camel's back,
[1:24:16.180 --> 1:24:17.940]  whatever you want to call it.
[1:24:17.940 --> 1:24:19.020]  And again, I'm building this up.
[1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:19.940]  I didn't used to do that.
[1:24:19.940 --> 1:24:23.820]  Because if I don't build it up, no one cares.
[1:24:23.820 --> 1:24:25.460]  And this makes me have hyperventilate.
[1:24:25.460 --> 1:24:26.700]  I mean, I had an anxiety attack when
[1:24:26.700 --> 1:24:28.060]  I finished reading this article.
[1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:29.580]  Because these people are killing us, man.
[1:24:29.580 --> 1:24:32.380]  I am, my body, it's not like I'm a tough guy.
[1:24:32.380 --> 1:24:33.980]  I want to come after you.
[1:24:33.980 --> 1:24:35.020]  It's not like, oh, I'm mad.
[1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:36.340]  I like to get mad, act like I'm mad.
[1:24:36.340 --> 1:24:39.700]  My body goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:24:39.700 --> 1:24:42.300]  And my brain's first saying, what are you going to do
[1:24:42.300 --> 1:24:44.220]  right now to stop these people?
[1:24:46.780 --> 1:24:48.940]  And I just have to intellectually figure out a way
[1:24:48.940 --> 1:24:50.700]  to politically, legally, and lawfully wake
[1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:53.060]  enough of people up to control of our governments
[1:24:53.060 --> 1:24:55.540]  so we can arrest these people, indict them, try them,
[1:24:55.540 --> 1:24:58.980]  and then put ropes around their goddamn nets.
[1:24:58.980 --> 1:25:01.380]  You murdering trash, I'm going to get your ass if it's
[1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:02.380]  the last thing I do.
[1:25:04.860 --> 1:25:08.420]  So politically, legally, and lawfully.
[1:25:08.420 --> 1:25:11.500]  But I'm not going to sit here and take these little murdering,
[1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:14.660]  science nerds killing everybody because they play God
[1:25:14.660 --> 1:25:17.420]  and they're on the little jack-off groups.
[1:25:17.420 --> 1:25:19.780]  They all hate themselves because they're projecting.
[1:25:19.780 --> 1:25:21.660]  They're hated themselves onto us.
[1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:22.180]  Well, guess what?
[1:25:22.180 --> 1:25:23.300]  I love humanity.
[1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:24.620]  I don't want to kill humanity.
[1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:26.020]  And you know who I don't like?
[1:25:26.020 --> 1:25:32.580]  It's you, Dr. Lou, and the rest of you
[1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:34.460]  that didn't want everybody else to die.
[1:25:34.460 --> 1:25:37.020]  You need to go first.
[1:25:37.020 --> 1:25:40.220]  I demand you kill yourself if there's too many people.
[1:25:40.220 --> 1:25:42.460]  You little sack of trash.
[1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:45.620]  You out of control megalomaniac.
[1:25:45.620 --> 1:25:46.340]  We'll be right back.
[1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:46.940]  Stay with us.
[1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:55.420]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also
[1:25:55.420 --> 1:25:56.660]  a bold person.
[1:25:56.660 --> 1:25:58.860]  And so as bad as things are with the globalists
[1:25:58.860 --> 1:26:01.140]  attacking humanity, with all the terrible things that
[1:26:01.140 --> 1:26:04.420]  are unfolding, I want you to know that a lot of positive things
[1:26:04.420 --> 1:26:06.580]  are happening as well.
[1:26:06.580 --> 1:26:08.820]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things
[1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:09.980]  zero public doesn't get to see.
[1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:12.340]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs
[1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:15.820]  or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood
[1:26:15.820 --> 1:26:19.420]  or mainstream media or industry, people
[1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:22.420]  are really, really away from the establishment.
[1:26:22.420 --> 1:26:24.180]  They don't want to go on with the globalists,
[1:26:24.180 --> 1:26:27.060]  but they're scared, they're looking for leadership.
[1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:29.020]  Well, that's where M4 comes in.

[1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:39.340]  is unpopular, what the globalists will target you for,
[1:26:39.340 --> 1:26:41.820]  to show people that it's safe to tell the truth
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:43.060]  and to take the heat.

[1:29:53.780 --> 1:30:15.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:30:24.180 --> 1:30:38.900]  Here's the deal. News is broken at infowarstore.com. That is just absolutely over the top important.
[1:30:38.900 --> 1:30:46.100]  Absolutely devastating information that is smoking gun beyond smoking gun beyond smoking gun and
[1:30:46.100 --> 1:30:50.020]  there's no way they're gonna be able to hide this. No way they're gonna be able to spend it. It's
[1:30:50.020 --> 1:30:55.180]  on infowarstore.com. It has the word smoking gun in the headline. I'm not gonna cover it till
[1:30:55.180 --> 1:31:02.980]  next hour. But as a man, as a father, as a human, it made me physically ill to actually read the
[1:31:02.980 --> 1:31:07.340]  article to check the documents and to know that this is indeed what happened. We already know
[1:31:07.340 --> 1:31:10.900]  it. We already know they cooked it up on purpose. We already know they released it on purpose but
[1:31:10.900 --> 1:31:17.740]  now we have the documents. I mean this is just makes me physically, I mean quite frankly it's a
[1:31:17.740 --> 1:31:21.340]  normal behavior. We should probably just go off air at this point. I mean this is like what we've
[1:31:21.340 --> 1:31:26.020]  been trained to sit here and accept and just take from these people because it's a scientific
[1:31:26.020 --> 1:31:35.220]  tyranny is absolutely out of control. All right, folks. Melissa Carone is an IT professional.
[1:31:35.220 --> 1:31:38.740]  He probably saw her all over the national news being demonized and attacked with Rudolph Giuliani
[1:31:38.740 --> 1:31:43.300]  in Michigan and other areas really challenging the fraud and showing what was happening. She's
[1:31:43.300 --> 1:31:47.780]  running for state representative which is what we need is to get people to take action. She
[1:31:47.780 --> 1:31:53.620]  stepped forward as a mother and a whistleblower bringing attention to this systemic voter fraud
[1:31:53.620 --> 1:31:58.860]  that stole the election from President Trump. She's a proud mother, Christian and courageous
[1:31:58.860 --> 1:32:05.060]  truth teller looking to take her fearlessness to Lansing. Recently Melissa has announced her
[1:32:05.060 --> 1:32:11.100]  intention to run again for state rep in Michigan's 46th district and she joins us now. Votecarone.com
[1:32:11.100 --> 1:32:21.020]  that's C-A-R-O-N-E or carone.com. Votecarone.com. She's a great lady and she told the truth and now
[1:32:21.020 --> 1:32:24.220]  she's being vindicated. Here's some of the headlines before we go to her. Wednesday live,
[1:32:24.220 --> 1:32:29.500]  GOP torpedoes, federal takeover, elections. Oh, that's racist. Oh, it's bad. No, it outlaws.
[1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:34.740]  What the Democrats did, it was already illegal. Republicans blocked Democrats sweeping voter
[1:32:34.740 --> 1:32:39.540]  rights bills. Not a voter rights bill. Let's you vote same day with no ID. Let's you mail-in
[1:32:39.540 --> 1:32:44.980]  ballots. Basically, let's see, legal's vote. Trump's coming out saying he never admitted
[1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:52.060]  defeat last election and says that he was not conceited. Beautiful. Trump keeps stoking
[1:32:52.060 --> 1:32:57.260]  resentment and reinstatement talk. Well, because if we prove the fraud, that's what happens.
[1:32:57.260 --> 1:33:04.660]  So they are in full panic mode. Melissa, thank you so much for joining us after going through
[1:33:04.660 --> 1:33:09.500]  this. It seems like a long time ago, but it was just seven months ago that we were
[1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:12.740]  all embroiled in the middle of the six months ago and everything has happened. I know you've
[1:33:12.740 --> 1:33:17.660]  been in the middle of it. Michigan is an IT specialist that works with elections, expanding
[1:33:17.660 --> 1:33:21.860]  on what you've been through with the whole country, what you expect to happen, what your
[1:33:21.860 --> 1:33:25.980]  contacts are saying. Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:33:25.980 --> 1:33:32.460]  Thank you so much for having me, Alex. I really appreciate it. In Michigan, I know a lot of
[1:33:32.460 --> 1:33:39.260]  people don't know this. Probably not, but Michigan has to be the worst, the most corrupted
[1:33:39.260 --> 1:33:47.620]  state when it comes to politics. We do not have a single senator. We do not have a single
[1:33:47.620 --> 1:33:54.340]  state rep that is going to call for a forensic audit. They're trying to trick us. They're
[1:33:54.340 --> 1:34:01.420]  trying to call for a regular audit. They're trying to say that it's not in the Constitution,
[1:34:01.420 --> 1:34:07.460]  that they literally can't do anything about it. Just last week, myself and a group of
[1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:14.820]  other individuals, including Patrick Colbeck, a former senator here in Michigan, and Maz
[1:34:14.820 --> 1:34:26.260]  Zeperno, the attorney for Antrim County, we went to Lansing and we delivered over 7,500
[1:34:26.260 --> 1:34:33.860]  affidavits for a calling for a forensic audit here in Michigan. Some of them were completely
[1:34:33.860 --> 1:34:41.700]  rejected by the legislators. Most of them ended up in one legislators' office. We are
[1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:48.380]  all calling for a forensic audit. Not a single one of our legislators went to Arizona to
[1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:56.180]  witness their forensic audit. We had a candidate for state representative, Christina Caramo,
[1:34:56.180 --> 1:35:00.020]  who went to witness that. I'm sorry.
[1:35:00.020 --> 1:35:03.980]  Oh, that's okay. That's okay. We just lost your video Skype for a moment. Go ahead. We
[1:35:03.980 --> 1:35:06.900]  liked your cat. What's your cat's name? Is that Sylvester?
[1:35:06.900 --> 1:35:15.980]  No. Actually, my son named him Mr. Sir, but he gets in all of my videos every time I'm
[1:35:15.980 --> 1:35:19.060]  on any kind of call.
[1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:21.100]  Well, he loves mommy.
[1:35:21.100 --> 1:35:23.620]  Yeah. Yeah. He's great.
[1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:26.860]  Well, we like the cat being there. Please continue.
[1:35:26.860 --> 1:35:35.020]  Thank you. Michigan is very corrupt. We just, Edward McRoom, he is a senator here. He just
[1:35:35.020 --> 1:35:45.820]  came out today with his investigation report of the 2020 election. In this report, it's
[1:35:45.820 --> 1:35:56.940]  about over 200 pages long. It goes through all of the testimonies for witnesses. And then
[1:35:56.940 --> 1:36:08.100]  his conclusion at the end is that there was not enough fraud to change the election results.
[1:36:08.100 --> 1:36:15.220]  He's literally saying that everything that was said to him in the testimonies isn't true.
[1:36:15.220 --> 1:36:21.420]  And he's not going to do what he's done. You know, it's just all of our legislators here
[1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:28.100]  are terrible. They are not Republicans. They are not. Our Michigan GOP, our state party
[1:36:28.100 --> 1:36:36.820]  is awful. We have people in our state party, the executive director, Jason Rowe, who came
[1:36:36.820 --> 1:36:42.060]  out a couple weeks ago and said Trump blew it. He didn't win the election. There wasn't
[1:36:42.060 --> 1:36:48.100]  enough fraud to sway the election results. This is a huge problem in Michigan. And we
[1:36:48.100 --> 1:36:50.500]  can't get anywhere here.
[1:36:50.500 --> 1:36:54.820]  Well, I'll tell you that the good news is, Trump is either the best president or the
[1:36:54.820 --> 1:36:58.180]  worst president ever. And he's a good guy who means well. But he energized the left
[1:36:58.180 --> 1:37:04.780]  to censor, to steal, to lie. And if that drawing them out and them stealing the election backfires
[1:37:04.780 --> 1:37:08.500]  and we bring them all down, then he's the greatest president ever. But if he doesn't
[1:37:08.500 --> 1:37:12.660]  win it, if we don't succeed in defeating them, he'll be the last president, basically. And
[1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:17.180]  so that's why I was on a big podcast, Andrew Schultz's podcast, and I said, you know, Trump's
[1:37:17.180 --> 1:37:21.380]  the worst president ever unless, of course, that's clickbait I was putting out and saying
[1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:25.900]  unless we take action, he can't do it alone. That's why what you did was so important.
[1:37:25.900 --> 1:37:30.060]  I mean, Michigan was one of the most blatant with the, I mean, for folks that don't know,
[1:37:30.060 --> 1:37:31.820]  recap what happened in Michigan.
[1:37:31.820 --> 1:37:38.460]  Yeah. Okay. So the video you were just showing, that video is the ballot dump that occurred
[1:37:38.460 --> 1:37:46.460]  at 430 AM. That was also in my testimony. I worked for Dominion. So I heard all of their
[1:37:46.460 --> 1:37:54.820]  conversations. One of the, Nick is his name. He was my manager. I didn't know at the time
[1:37:54.820 --> 1:38:02.340]  he's a co-owner. He was at the TCF Center in Detroit for the 20s, whole 27 hours I was
[1:38:02.340 --> 1:38:08.420]  there. That is the ballot dump that happened. We thought it happened once it actually happened
[1:38:08.420 --> 1:38:15.060]  three times. Now that we've got the video surveillance, it was all of those, that van
[1:38:15.060 --> 1:38:22.780]  was three times it was escorted by a police escort. You know, now we have the chief of
[1:38:22.780 --> 1:38:28.660]  police, James Craig here in Michigan running for governor. And that is a question I want
[1:38:28.660 --> 1:38:29.660]  to ask him.
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:37.740]  But back to what I saw, I witnessed just like in every other swing state, re-scanning of
[1:38:37.740 --> 1:38:43.220]  the ballots several times without discarding them. That is, that's the key point without
[1:38:43.220 --> 1:38:48.660]  discarding them. If they were discarding and then re-scanning, it wouldn't be a problem.
[1:38:48.660 --> 1:38:54.380]  But they were not discarding. So it was counting votes several times. I was initially scheduled
[1:38:54.380 --> 1:39:00.300]  to work at the Detroit Department of Election Center, which Dominion employees referred
[1:39:00.300 --> 1:39:07.620]  to as the Chicago warehouse. I was trained in the adjudication and tabulation process.
[1:39:07.620 --> 1:39:16.340]  I recorded my whole training session with Dominion on my phone. The things I, everything
[1:39:16.340 --> 1:39:23.580]  I saw that night was fraud. Everything. Nick, my manager, sent another Dominion employee
[1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:31.420]  Samuel to the Chicago warehouse at around midnight to assist with ballots. What he was
[1:39:31.420 --> 1:39:39.380]  doing was he was assisting with filling out fraudulent ballots for getting ready for
[1:39:39.380 --> 1:39:46.820]  that ballot job at 4.30 in the morning. You know, the TCS center was still there because
[1:39:46.820 --> 1:39:50.380]  I should have set up front. You're a whistleblower that actually heard them saying this. We'll
[1:39:50.380 --> 1:39:53.260]  come back and talk about what you let them say with us.
[1:39:53.260 --> 1:39:58.420]  I'm a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person. And so as bad as things are with
[1:39:58.420 --> 1:40:02.180]  the globalist attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are unfolding, I want
[1:40:02.180 --> 1:40:08.420]  you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well. I'm a public figure. So I get to
[1:40:08.420 --> 1:40:11.860]  see things that are public doesn't get to see. And let me tell you, whether it's police
[1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:19.340]  chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:24.500]  people are really, really awake in the establishment. They don't want to go on with the globalist,
[1:40:24.500 --> 1:40:30.220]  they're scared, they're looking for leadership. Well, that's where M4 comes in. You fund us,
[1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:34.620]  you support m4store.com, you get great products at the same time. We will then go out and
[1:40:34.620 --> 1:40:39.740]  do what the globalist says unpopular, what the globalist will target you for to show
[1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:45.060]  people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat. That's our job. So please
[1:40:45.060 --> 1:40:50.300]  keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups in the information
[1:40:50.300 --> 1:40:57.860]  war. Fund us at m4store.com.
[1:40:57.860 --> 1:41:01.660]  Granny do right, granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[1:41:01.660 --> 1:41:07.300]  Yeah, first of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the seniors
[1:41:07.300 --> 1:41:11.980]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sun
[1:41:11.980 --> 1:41:17.580]  spots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple
[1:41:17.580 --> 1:41:24.620]  of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:28.660]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[1:41:28.660 --> 1:41:32.980]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started
[1:41:32.980 --> 1:41:37.900]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started
[1:41:37.900 --> 1:41:43.020]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know,
[1:41:43.020 --> 1:41:49.340]  I don't, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:41:49.340 --> 1:41:55.300]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:41:55.300 --> 1:42:01.980]  Big Pharma was born out of the Rockefeller oil industry in 1900 with the petrochemical.
[1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:08.380]  The petrochemical then dominated two major industries, plastics and drugs. Companies
[1:42:08.380 --> 1:42:14.900]  began synthesizing patented versions of naturally sourced drugs. The natural sources were then
[1:42:14.900 --> 1:42:20.660]  made illegal. Pharmaceuticals became medicine and the sicker people got, the more their
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:26.380]  industry grew. It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape. Good health
[1:42:26.380 --> 1:42:32.820]  begins with a healthy immune system, which needs the proper nutrients to thrive. Nutrients,
[1:42:32.820 --> 1:42:38.340]  we cannot readily get from our food today. The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and
[1:42:38.340 --> 1:42:44.300]  vitamin D3 with calcium have been proven to be what we need to maintain a healthy immune
[1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:50.460]  system. Go to inforstore.com and start supporting your natural immune system now with the mega

[1:43:57.540 --> 1:44:27.460]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Melissa Carone is our guest and she was working
[1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:33.260]  before Dominion. She witnessed what was unfolding there on election night in Michigan. And I
[1:44:33.260 --> 1:44:36.860]  wanted to get her on just about all the current things she sees and the evidence coming out
[1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:42.100]  in Georgia, in Arizona, now, the governor and the secretary of state and others are
[1:44:42.100 --> 1:44:46.540]  having to admit that okay, there were ballots that were counted repeatedly that night at
[1:44:46.540 --> 1:44:50.100]  the CNN center where they've got them hidden and running the machines over and over again.
[1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:55.180]  I mean, they've got a real problem. I don't see how they ever end up gaslighting people.
[1:44:55.180 --> 1:44:59.660]  The whole show that more people think the election was stolen than just thought six
[1:44:59.660 --> 1:45:03.980]  months ago. A 70-plus percent of Republicans, 30-plus percent of Democrats, and those numbers
[1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:09.900]  are growing. What's your take on the big 35,000-foot view here, Melissa, on just the overall?
[1:45:09.900 --> 1:45:13.580]  Because I understand you're saying Michigan's really bad. You witnessed all this. It was
[1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:17.460]  crazy. We'll get back into that in a moment. But just as somebody that stood up as a mom,
[1:45:17.460 --> 1:45:22.060]  as a patriot, as a software, you know, you know, IT engineer that was witnessing this,
[1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:25.820]  I mean, it's going to be you. Moms, you know, working hard, you know, from home with their
[1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:29.660]  cat, they're going to save the country. It's going to be regular people stepping up and
[1:45:29.660 --> 1:45:33.140]  saying, no, what do you think? Is this a citizen who's been in the middle of this from the
[1:45:33.140 --> 1:45:37.460]  beginning watching this thing unfold?
[1:45:37.460 --> 1:45:43.940]  You know, from the very beginning, I'll tell you, I honestly thought that all of this would
[1:45:43.940 --> 1:45:50.780]  be exposed by now. You know, with the Arizona audit coming out or the report coming out,
[1:45:50.780 --> 1:45:55.700]  I know for a fact that it's going to show massive fraud, and it's going to show that
[1:45:55.700 --> 1:46:03.100]  Trump won in a landslide in Arizona. You know, all we need is three states to approve this.
[1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:08.700]  Georgia is next, I believe, New Hampshire. And I hope that we can get this approved in
[1:46:08.700 --> 1:46:17.500]  Michigan. But, you know, I'm concerned because when the reports come out, Alex, what are
[1:46:17.500 --> 1:46:24.300]  we going to, what's going to happen next? You know, are they going to be left to the
[1:46:24.300 --> 1:46:25.300]  people?
[1:46:25.300 --> 1:46:31.020]  No, I agree. I'm just rhetorically here listening to you. You're absolutely right. So where
[1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:32.460]  do you see this going?
[1:46:32.460 --> 1:46:38.260]  Well, I feel like it's going to be left up to the people to do something. And I feel
[1:46:38.260 --> 1:46:47.340]  like that this is going to cause, I hate to say this, but almost a civil war in our country.
[1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:51.860]  Well, this is a foreign takeover. And I mean, now you've got the vaccine they're trying
[1:46:51.860 --> 1:46:56.700]  to force on people. You've got the censorship going on. You've got all the tyranny. You've
[1:46:56.700 --> 1:47:01.940]  got the big corporations that are buying up all the raw resources that they use that year
[1:47:01.940 --> 1:47:07.460]  lockdown to take that time to buy up all the infrastructure and to go in and get all the
[1:47:07.460 --> 1:47:12.260]  suppliers. And so this is a crippling of Europe, the United States, the Western world. I don't
[1:47:12.260 --> 1:47:17.700]  think people realize this is modern economic, psychological warfare we've been hit by. And
[1:47:17.700 --> 1:47:20.540]  along with that goes all the election fraud.
[1:47:20.540 --> 1:47:27.140]  That's right. See, in Michigan here, we have, we have Whitmer, we have Benson, we have,
[1:47:27.140 --> 1:47:33.060]  we hit, everybody was in on it. They were all in on it. Working at that TCS center. That's
[1:47:33.060 --> 1:47:38.420]  all. I knew everybody in there was in on this. They were all, all the workers were in on
[1:47:38.420 --> 1:47:45.420]  the fraud. They had to have been in the way they divided the fraud up between people.
[1:47:45.420 --> 1:47:52.180]  And it's just, it was very clever on their part. I must say that, but I just can't believe
[1:47:52.180 --> 1:47:58.620]  it didn't leak out to, to, to anyone. You know, I can't believe that we didn't know.
[1:47:58.620 --> 1:48:02.220]  We knew that there was going to be fraud. We didn't know to, it was good. We were going
[1:48:02.220 --> 1:48:06.940]  to have fraud to the level we had it. I mean, it was, it goes all the way up and nobody
[1:48:06.940 --> 1:48:11.700]  can, nobody's going to get prosecuted for this because our attorney general wasn't on
[1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:17.220]  it. You know, I mean, Dana Nussle, she's awful. These, you know, the way they were
[1:48:17.220 --> 1:48:24.780]  threatening attorneys that were working for the Trump, you know, for Trump during the,
[1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:30.700]  during all the election and threatening them to take their licenses. I mean, what's going
[1:48:30.700 --> 1:48:39.260]  on in, in our country is it's communism. It's communism. And people, you know, and it happened,
[1:48:39.260 --> 1:48:45.380]  it happened from the school boards up. They got control of our school boards and that
[1:48:45.380 --> 1:48:54.260]  controlled the kids and, and they worked their way up. So we have to get Republicans, conservatives,
[1:48:54.260 --> 1:49:04.460]  the first Republicans to run for school board. County clerk is a very, very important position.
[1:49:04.460 --> 1:49:10.780]  They determine whether these counties use Dominion machines. We shouldn't be using machines
[1:49:10.780 --> 1:49:17.180]  at all to count our votes. I know several people that will volunteer their time and
[1:49:17.180 --> 1:49:23.300]  count ballots and, and, you know, they say that it's not accurate. Well, I'm sure that
[1:49:23.300 --> 1:49:28.660]  it's more accurate than a machine flipping an entire county. Sure. And the same people
[1:49:28.660 --> 1:49:32.780]  running or voting machines want to get rid of your cat. They claim humans are bad. Anything
[1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:37.540]  that eats food is bad. They claim that smoke is bad. They'll smoke out of chimneys is what
[1:49:37.540 --> 1:49:42.180]  creates nuclei in the rain. It's part of the life cycle on earth, burning forests and lightning
[1:49:42.180 --> 1:49:48.740]  strikes. This is a cult of control freaks. Absolutely. It is. It is. And they don't want
[1:49:48.740 --> 1:49:53.660]  anyone, everyone, look at what they did to me after the election. I was all over the
[1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:59.940]  media. They made me look crazy. Like I was completely insane. And I would do a two hour
[1:49:59.940 --> 1:50:05.580]  interview with a news channel. They would cut it into five minutes and make me look
[1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:11.940]  like a complete, I mean, like I was completely insane. And it happened so many times that
[1:50:11.940 --> 1:50:17.380]  I let's talk about, let's talk about what you witnessed. I mean, with Dominion because
[1:50:17.380 --> 1:50:25.940]  you want to stay on record that you want to say you witnessed. Yeah. Yeah. So working
[1:50:25.940 --> 1:50:34.860]  with Dominion, I was hired because my resume was all over at the time on job websites. So
[1:50:34.860 --> 1:50:40.460]  they called me and they asked me to work the election. They said it was going to be a very
[1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:47.820]  long shift. It could be up to 72 hours. I, I agreed to work it. I was very excited to
[1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:56.220]  do it. When I got there, I was on a stage in the middle of like, say a big huge gym
[1:50:56.220 --> 1:51:04.100]  is where, what the TCF center looks like. And, you know, the first thing I noticed was
[1:51:04.100 --> 1:51:14.020]  I was told not to wear anything that was political or that proved what party I belong to. I wore
[1:51:14.020 --> 1:51:20.940]  a red shirt just because, and I just noticed that people in the room had, were wearing
[1:51:20.940 --> 1:51:30.260]  masks that said Black Lives Matter. You know, they had on their shirts Black Lives Matter.
[1:51:30.260 --> 1:51:38.420]  Something was said to them. Dominion employees were speaking terrible about Republicans saying
[1:51:38.420 --> 1:51:45.780]  that anybody that had American flag on their mask or their shirt were Trump supporters.
[1:51:45.780 --> 1:51:50.460]  You know, at that point I knew who I was dealing with. So I didn't, I didn't talk about what
[1:51:50.460 --> 1:51:56.140]  party I support. I didn't even talk about anything. Now, one time did I see a single
[1:51:56.140 --> 1:52:05.660]  ballot in 27 hours for Donald Trump. In 27 hours, I did not see that. I was, I was there
[1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:12.500]  as an IT professional. I, my job was to walk up and down the tabulating machines and they
[1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:19.620]  were in a row and answer any questions that any of the, that the workers had. That's how
[1:52:19.620 --> 1:52:25.860]  I noticed that they were rerunning ballots several times. Now, something very important
[1:52:25.860 --> 1:52:33.740]  at the TCF center, normally the steel ballot box is under the tabulating machines. At the
[1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:41.380]  TCF center, they were behind, the steel ballot boxes were behind the workers, behind the
[1:52:41.380 --> 1:52:48.780]  city workers. So that means several times I've been asked by senators here in Michigan.
[1:52:48.780 --> 1:52:54.740]  They say, how, how were they rerunning these ballots when, when the ballots dropped directly
[1:52:54.740 --> 1:53:00.380]  into a steel ballot box? Well, they didn't drop directly into a steel ballot box. The
[1:53:00.380 --> 1:53:08.100]  steel ballot box was behind them. So they had access to these ballots for like 10, 15,
[1:53:08.100 --> 1:53:14.260]  sometimes 30 minutes. You know, my training with Dominion, as again, I have, I have it
[1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:20.980]  recorded. I have an audio recorded. I also have the Dominion employee binder that shows
[1:53:20.980 --> 1:53:27.700]  how every, all their hardware is connected to the internet. I know that it's connected
[1:53:27.700 --> 1:53:36.980]  to the internet. About 11pm on November 3rd, my manager Nick and Samuel, they were panicking.
[1:53:36.980 --> 1:53:39.780]  They were on their phones. They were, they were all stressed out.
[1:53:39.780 --> 1:53:42.100]  Hold on. We've got to go to break. I want you to come back. I want you to come back
[1:53:42.100 --> 1:53:47.780]  to five more minutes with us on what you witnessed that night because the system is really trying
[1:53:47.780 --> 1:53:52.500]  to suppress this type of discussion. The system does not want people to know this. We'll be
[1:53:52.500 --> 1:53:59.220]  right back with Melissa Carone on the other side. Votecarone.com, V-O-T-E, Carone.com. Couldn't
[1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:02.020]  think of a better person for you to get in there. And even though there's all that fraud
[1:54:02.020 --> 1:54:06.260]  in Michigan, she's going to run to expose it. And that's why the state's marching to reform
[1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:10.580]  election fraud is so key. And she's going to get to them panicking as they obviously will
[1:54:10.580 --> 1:54:15.060]  pull up the famous Michigan graph where Trump's way ahead, they close things up, ballots keep
[1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:22.260]  getting counted. And then magically, magically, ladies and gentlemen, Biden wins the same scam
[1:54:22.260 --> 1:54:26.420]  over and over and over again. All right, we'll be right back. And then I'm going to hit the
[1:54:26.420 --> 1:54:32.100]  biggest news ever. The biggest news in election, in everything is bigger than election fraud,
[1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:37.540]  bigger than everything. The smoking gun of Fauci, wait till you hear this. This is unbelievable.
[1:54:37.540 --> 1:54:40.340]  But we all knew it was what they did, but they've now been caught. Stay with us.

[1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:50.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:56:50.020 --> 1:57:18.020]  All right, Melissa Carone's final segment got caught off by the break. And then we got smoking
[1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:26.020]  on documents on Fauci that just got me totally blown away. I just keep thinking I can handle
[1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:30.020]  the next thing that's going to happen. It just gets so insane. Wait till you see this coming up next
[1:57:30.020 --> 1:57:35.020]  segment and the documents we've got. It's unbelievable. These people are so sloppy about what they do.
[1:57:35.020 --> 1:57:39.020]  They're so arrogant. They think they control big tech and big media. They can steal elections,
[1:57:39.020 --> 1:57:47.020]  release coronaviruses. But in the end, just like Hitler's little monkey cohorts, they're going to be
[1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:52.020]  swinging from the end of a row. So just keep pushing. It's not going to be me that doesn't.
[1:57:52.020 --> 1:58:03.020]  I want legal lawful systems. No vigilantes. We want them alive. Facing trial. To quote Darth Vader,
[1:58:03.020 --> 1:58:09.020]  no disintegrations. So, Melissa, finishing up with what you witnessed on election night.
[1:58:09.020 --> 1:58:22.020]  Yeah. So around 11 o'clock p.m., again, my manager Nick and Samuel were panicking. And I walked up to
[1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:34.020]  them and I said that everything okay. They told me that they just had a data loss. I just stood
[1:58:34.020 --> 1:58:40.020]  there and he said, well, we took care of it. Don't worry about it. Everything's fine. Well, later on,
[1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:48.020]  I was putting everything together and I realized that it wasn't a data loss. This was when they found
[1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:58.020]  out Trump was ahead. 150,000 votes in Michigan. And then Nick continued to send Samuel to the
[1:58:58.020 --> 1:59:06.020]  Chicago warehouse to assist with ballots for that big ballot dump at 4.30 a.m., the three ballot dumps.
[1:59:06.020 --> 1:59:14.020]  So I heard all of their conversations. The stuff that these people did, the fraud that they are responsible
[1:59:14.020 --> 1:59:21.020]  for, I posted their first and last names on my Facebook. I posted their phone numbers. I posted
[1:59:21.020 --> 1:59:29.020]  everything about them, screenshots of their social media. Our Department of Justice has done
[1:59:29.020 --> 1:59:35.020]  nothing about this. They have not even looked into this. There's a judge here in Michigan that was
[1:59:35.020 --> 1:59:43.020]  going through the affidavits that was reading mine and specifically named me and said I'm not
[1:59:43.020 --> 1:59:49.020]  a credible source because my affidavit doesn't match up with anybody else's. Well, why would it?
[1:59:49.020 --> 1:59:54.020]  I was working for Dominion. I overheard their conversations. Nobody else is going to know who Nick
[1:59:54.020 --> 1:59:59.020]  is. Nobody's going to know who Samuel is. Nobody's going to know that they were sent to the Chicago
[1:59:59.020 --> 2:00:06.020]  warehouse, you know, the Detroit Department of Elections. And when that judge did that, it really
[2:00:06.020 --> 2:00:12.020]  negatively affected the case in Antrim County. Of course. Well, I mean, look, this is systemic
[2:00:12.020 --> 2:00:17.020]  corruption and election fraud of the Democrats is well known. And what you've done has been one of
[2:00:17.020 --> 2:00:21.020]  the most credible people out there to expose it. It's been beautiful. I just hope you get into state
[2:00:21.020 --> 2:00:27.020]  legislature. Again, Trump overwhelm. You didn't even see Trump ballots because they were stuffing
[2:00:27.020 --> 2:00:32.020]  them so bad. But because the outside counties, it was so overwhelming that they knew they had to just
[2:00:32.020 --> 2:00:36.020]  push it above and beyond. And that's why it created that graph that no one else has ever seen
[2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:42.020]  except in this election, where it closes Trump's head. And then magically when it reopens, he's
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:48.020]  way behind and Biden has surged the lead. That's what you call fraud. And without people like you
[2:00:48.020 --> 2:00:53.020]  doing this, we would not know the inside baseball. But of course, you're the eyewitness. You're the person
[2:00:53.020 --> 2:00:59.020]  on record that worked for it. You saw it. They don't deny that. They just say disregard our affidavit.
[2:00:59.020 --> 2:01:07.020]  So just absolutely disgusting. It is, it is Alex. And you know, this is we, we have to have America
[2:01:07.020 --> 2:01:14.020]  first candidates. We have to. Right now I am falling behind in donations. I got, I have Roger
[2:01:14.020 --> 2:01:23.020]  Stone's endorsement. I have Mike Lindell's endorsement. I have Rudy Giuliani. And I have a couple more.
[2:01:23.020 --> 2:01:27.020]  Well, you got my endorsement. My list is endorsement and President Trump to come speak in
[2:01:27.020 --> 2:01:35.020]  Michigan after he's done in Tampa. So vote. Corone.com. C A R O N E vote. Corone.com. Melissa.
[2:01:35.020 --> 2:01:39.020]  I want to get you back on soon with an update. Hell, we ought to fly it out into Texas. But
[2:01:39.020 --> 2:01:42.020]  regardless, everybody's got to get behind you because you're a key eyewitness. Thank you.
[2:01:42.020 --> 2:01:48.020]  Thank you so much. Have a great day. Wow. She is a eyewitness. Boy, they don't want to touch her.
[2:01:48.020 --> 2:01:55.020]  Notice that they don't want to go after her. People pat me on the back all the time. And I really,
[2:01:55.020 --> 2:01:59.020]  really appreciate it. But I want you to understand something. Don't put the horse in front of the
[2:01:59.020 --> 2:02:06.020]  cart here. Don't put the wagon in front of the mules here. If you weren't supporting us, if you

[2:03:04.020 --> 2:03:11.020]  Live from the info wars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:03:11.020 --> 2:03:21.020]  You, don't have my name.迟anny.
[2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:31.020]  You don't have it. But it is now.
[2:03:31.020 --> 2:03:59.260]  If you were going to make a run at humanity and set up a worldwide government to steal
[2:03:59.260 --> 2:04:05.580]  the future would you do it with tanks or aircraft would you do it in black
[2:04:05.580 --> 2:04:20.940]  uniforms no that's always failed but if you did it through the medical system
[2:04:20.940 --> 2:04:25.780]  and through propaganda and through a rainbow flag you'd have a good shot at
[2:04:25.780 --> 2:04:31.260]  catching humanity with her pants down now I want to explain something when I
[2:04:31.260 --> 2:04:40.900]  cover this next story everything in this article makes me physically sick
[2:04:40.900 --> 2:04:51.460]  because I was studying who Fauci and all these people were 20 years ago so to sit
[2:04:51.460 --> 2:04:54.620]  here and try to explain it to the public it's like somebody trying to teach
[2:04:54.620 --> 2:05:01.220]  somebody Martian that never knew how to speak Martian but I think you've seen so
[2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:06.180]  far that we're not making this stuff up for whatever weird reason I got into
[2:05:06.180 --> 2:05:12.500]  studying this stuff very very early you know we're the 27 years overnight
[2:05:12.500 --> 2:05:18.940]  success story and here's why I'm really frustrated and I and the best way to
[2:05:18.940 --> 2:05:22.980]  describe this is just tell you my own personal psychological processing because
[2:05:22.980 --> 2:05:29.260]  I don't do this you're not gonna get it and I'm the same way we don't have much
[2:05:29.260 --> 2:05:35.300]  time to stop this and they believe your idiots and they believe your fools and
[2:05:35.300 --> 2:05:38.820]  they believe they can depopulate you and that you're gonna do nothing about it
[2:05:38.820 --> 2:05:43.140]  and if you do nothing about it they metaphysically through survival of the
[2:05:43.140 --> 2:05:50.460]  fittest and social Darwinism believe that you deserve it so it is not
[2:05:50.460 --> 2:05:54.900]  theatrics that I almost went to take for ten minutes to just try to go in my
[2:05:54.900 --> 2:05:59.100]  office and read over these articles again and just try to come out here and
[2:05:59.100 --> 2:06:05.620]  give this speech because even a statesman even a great orator delivering
[2:06:05.620 --> 2:06:09.500]  this type of information would take months to prepare something like this
[2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:19.980]  we don't have months here's an analogy imagine you're an astronomer 150 years
[2:06:19.980 --> 2:06:25.060]  ago you learned about sunspots mass coronal ejections and in that alternate
[2:06:25.060 --> 2:06:29.260]  reality that alternate universe you're looking at the Sun one day through your
[2:06:29.260 --> 2:06:35.700]  green lens protect your eyes and you see a mass coronal ejection so much bigger
[2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:39.740]  you've ever seen and you realize the Sun has just exploded like well that's not a
[2:06:39.740 --> 2:06:43.660]  mass coronal ejection that's not a sunspot it's as big as the Sun now wait
[2:06:43.660 --> 2:06:48.060]  the Sun is exploding it's a supernova we're gonna be dead in seven minutes
[2:06:48.060 --> 2:06:54.380]  because you've measured light you know light gets here in seven minutes and
[2:06:54.380 --> 2:07:00.220]  that's what this is like for me I'm a father I'm a regular person you I mean
[2:07:00.220 --> 2:07:04.500]  and I'm here watching them destroy our economy watching them turn us against
[2:07:04.500 --> 2:07:09.940]  each other watching them enslave us and I'm just like you and I'm watching the
[2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:20.340]  equivalent of a political cultural supernova and the destruction of humanity
[2:07:20.340 --> 2:07:25.220]  and I'm looking at it through a telescope right now and we got seven
[2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:35.220]  minutes to live but we don't have seven minutes we got two three years until
[2:07:35.220 --> 2:07:39.020]  it's too late to stop their operation and I'm not gonna join them in their
[2:07:39.020 --> 2:07:47.900]  operation even to save my family it's probably not too late because I could
[2:07:47.900 --> 2:07:54.020]  still join them but then I'd lose my soul and so it's physically nauseating to
[2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:59.020]  sit here and talk about this and I'm not building this up I'm just teeing it up
[2:07:59.020 --> 2:08:07.420]  that imagine if you were an astronomer and the Sun started having a bunch of
[2:08:07.420 --> 2:08:16.380]  coronal mass ejections and use the Superman analogy you know his dad says
[2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:20.340]  this planet's gonna collapse and explode we've taken too much energy out of its
[2:08:20.340 --> 2:08:25.780]  core they were using like thermal some type of thermal geothermal energy he
[2:08:25.780 --> 2:08:28.580]  said you've exhausted the core of the planet the planet's gonna implode now
[2:08:28.580 --> 2:08:34.140]  after hundreds of thousands of years of you know you'll never never advancing
[2:08:34.140 --> 2:08:39.180]  being stagnant and it's my estimation within six months this planet will
[2:08:39.180 --> 2:08:49.780]  explode by imploding and then that's what happened in that fictional world so
[2:08:49.780 --> 2:08:57.220]  that's the allegory of where we are they have flipped the switches they have
[2:08:57.220 --> 2:09:05.940]  initiated the depopulation and and I know the sick part of you because I'm
[2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:09.220]  just as sick as you are probably sicker you're like screw these leftists and
[2:09:09.220 --> 2:09:13.540]  idiots with their mask and their shots let them die we're gonna have to take
[2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:16.700]  care of them they're gonna sap and destroy all the pension funds the
[2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:21.060]  economy and implode it all and then it's gonna get worse they're gonna release
[2:09:21.060 --> 2:09:25.860]  real deadly variants as they're now announcing I'm just like you I'm like
[2:09:25.860 --> 2:09:30.300]  screw them fine let them down I'm like oh no wait a minute because that's gonna
[2:09:30.300 --> 2:09:36.460]  come back on us anything evil always does that's why joining the globalist
[2:09:36.460 --> 2:09:41.580]  he's only pretending because there is no joining with evil like this so I'm gonna
[2:09:41.580 --> 2:09:49.060]  I promise I'll cover it next segment I'm happy to throw up because I won't take
[2:09:49.060 --> 2:09:52.580]  what Fauci and Gates have done to us there's just some new piece of news and
[2:09:52.580 --> 2:09:56.500]  like not making a big deal I'm gonna fully absorb it I'm gonna do whatever it
[2:09:56.500 --> 2:09:59.780]  takes to stop them or I'm gonna die trying see that's what's normal about a
[2:09:59.780 --> 2:10:03.380]  commitment against evil and that's what you're gonna have to do and I'm gonna
[2:10:03.380 --> 2:10:07.020]  have to do we're all gonna have to do it and not just take the next piece of
[2:10:07.020 --> 2:10:11.420]  info as they piss in our faces and as they kill our children and as they do
[2:10:11.420 --> 2:10:18.300]  this is normal and something we're gonna accept we cannot do it anymore and of
[2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:21.620]  course he predicts what he's about to already do yeah print that off for me I
[2:10:21.620 --> 2:10:28.660]  mean this is so easy to predict look at those two psychotics
[2:10:28.860 --> 2:10:36.300]  your TV viewer the headlines on info wars.com
[2:10:37.500 --> 2:10:45.660]  smoking gun one month before COVID outbreak Fauci and Moderna sent an MRNA
[2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:52.500]  coronavirus vaccine candidates to the Wuhan lab link doctor
[2:10:55.140 --> 2:11:03.020]  what's that mean well I had my big smoking gun a few months ago head of
[2:11:03.020 --> 2:11:13.140]  Gates program head of Gates program admits to developing COVID-19 virus
[2:11:13.140 --> 2:11:18.220]  Peter does it same one that ran the whitewash over all but this is them right
[2:11:18.220 --> 2:11:23.060]  when they knew they were releasing it saying okay go ahead and produce your
[2:11:23.060 --> 2:11:28.460]  vaccine which this lab was involved already developing under other names
[2:11:28.460 --> 2:11:33.420]  they just changed the name so you go oh my god look how incredible we are we
[2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:39.980]  already have it ready for you right now and how they transferred it from
[2:11:39.980 --> 2:11:49.020]  Chapel Hill to Wuhan so they could hide their operations I mean the smoking gun
[2:11:49.020 --> 2:11:53.340]  is them running the lab saying they to do MRNA getting the viruses out of the
[2:11:53.340 --> 2:11:57.140]  caves bringing it there making it all I mean that's all there already this is
[2:11:57.140 --> 2:12:02.580]  just like almost as bad as a confession video from Fauci because they wanted the
[2:12:02.580 --> 2:12:09.220]  money on top of it so did you know Fauci was already giving candidates for a
[2:12:09.220 --> 2:12:14.860]  COVID-19 vaccine before anyone even knew about it or announced it isn't that
[2:12:14.860 --> 2:12:22.500]  cute oh the IMF and World Bank had articles two years before about COVID-19
[2:12:22.500 --> 2:12:27.540]  and their internal documents have come out she told an actuary it's all been
[2:12:27.540 --> 2:12:32.380]  prepared that's why Fauci got up in 2017 and said soon Trump will be challenged
[2:12:32.380 --> 2:12:37.580]  by this big pandemic and they're all got it all prescripted already and we're
[2:12:37.580 --> 2:12:40.860]  all supposed to just sit here while they kill us and shut us down and bankrupt
[2:12:40.860 --> 2:12:44.620]  us and say we're not essential and just they all save me Bill Gates save me
[2:12:44.620 --> 2:12:49.300]  Fauci instead of arrest their asses right now
[2:12:49.300 --> 2:12:55.060]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast hell I've
[2:12:55.060 --> 2:12:59.020]  been on there 27 years and only the last year or so if I said that but let me tell
[2:12:59.020 --> 2:13:02.620]  you the New World Order is breathing down our neck the big globalist

[2:17:07.700 --> 2:17:21.860]  the hospitals in the last year and a half were empty and all those cancer
[2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:25.100]  patients and all those heart patients and all those patients that had flesh
[2:17:25.100 --> 2:17:31.300]  shooting bacteria they had to die they admit that and the 15 plus million the
[2:17:31.300 --> 2:17:35.060]  starved death in the first year alone on top of the 15 million that normally
[2:17:35.060 --> 2:17:39.500]  starved to death and all the millions that died of other diseases that couldn't
[2:17:39.500 --> 2:17:45.860]  get treatment we're all sacrificed the name of this hysteria and this lie
[2:17:45.860 --> 2:17:50.620]  what's the name of today's broadcast learn how the great reset plan is to
[2:17:50.620 --> 2:17:59.300]  kill you and your family that's not a lie that's the truth a psychotic cult of
[2:17:59.300 --> 2:18:03.180]  scientists backed by the richest corporations on earth have launched
[2:18:03.180 --> 2:18:16.620]  their post human in game so you want me to play a 10 or 15 top scientists saying
[2:18:16.620 --> 2:18:22.260]  we should be popular with the earth using viruses or maybe the Queen Elizabeth
[2:18:22.260 --> 2:18:27.660]  husband saying it or maybe maybe their son saying it or maybe Ted Turner's
[2:18:27.660 --> 2:18:31.700]  saying it maybe Bill Gates saying it we played all that before they're doing it
[2:18:31.700 --> 2:18:37.220]  to us and the good news is they're a little pissed they can't believe actually
[2:18:37.220 --> 2:18:40.580]  that they're only getting like 50% inoculation rates it's not as high as
[2:18:40.580 --> 2:18:44.460]  they're saying and they're really upset that people are talking about them and
[2:18:44.460 --> 2:18:52.700]  the things they've done the things they've been up to we got a real fighting
[2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:58.620]  chance at this but we knew what was coming a world ID a world social credit
[2:18:58.620 --> 2:19:02.100]  score where you don't have a job unless you take whatever it is these
[2:19:02.100 --> 2:19:09.820]  corporations want to put in your body and I was wrong everybody gives me
[2:19:09.820 --> 2:19:13.660]  credit for being way ahead of the curve and knowing all this stuff I predicted
[2:19:13.660 --> 2:19:17.380]  when they launched their simulant bio attack that it would be real to a
[2:19:17.380 --> 2:19:22.460]  certain extent but a carrier for a future more deadly version and that was
[2:19:22.460 --> 2:19:32.100]  true that was right but not that when they gave the first vaccine I figured it
[2:19:32.100 --> 2:19:37.140]  would be basically placebo to set the precedent that it wouldn't hurt you so
[2:19:37.140 --> 2:19:43.180]  you'd trust the next big one I was wrong they're so far behind they said screw it
[2:19:43.180 --> 2:19:48.060]  let's kill a whole bunch of people name a bunch sterilize a bunch and see if we
[2:19:48.060 --> 2:19:51.860]  can manage this and carry this out because there's psychos and that's what
[2:19:51.860 --> 2:19:55.420]  they're into you're like why do they do that they got all that money so they
[2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:59.260]  should be out on yachts and airplanes and having fun because they're killers
[2:19:59.260 --> 2:20:03.740]  they're of their father the devil they can't help it yeah we'll play the
[2:20:03.740 --> 2:20:09.060]  surprise outbreak clip next segment so yeah they've got a beating up villagers
[2:20:09.060 --> 2:20:14.300]  force inoculating them making them wear skull and crossbones necklaces I talked
[2:20:14.300 --> 2:20:16.940]  to my wife about she was I don't believe that and she looked at the videos is on
[2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:21.900]  national Hindu news them doing all this like that you know that even the
[2:20:21.900 --> 2:20:27.540]  religious news of India is putting it up to the Indian times all of it I mean
[2:20:27.540 --> 2:20:35.780]  that's what's happening this is a cult of control and people are told you can't
[2:20:35.780 --> 2:20:38.940]  go out you can't have a job you're gonna go bankrupt your business is shut down
[2:20:38.940 --> 2:20:42.940]  you can't ship your farm produce unless you take a shot villagers start coming
[2:20:42.940 --> 2:20:45.580]  and kicking your ass they go listen they're not gonna let us ship our produce
[2:20:45.580 --> 2:20:49.380]  out of here have electricity until everybody's inoculated until the
[2:20:49.380 --> 2:20:53.740]  villagers beat your ass themselves and hold you down and make you take it they
[2:20:53.740 --> 2:21:00.940]  want to make that what did what did another Bronin say our vice president
[2:21:00.940 --> 2:21:04.660]  Kamala Harris I'll play the clip next segment hell fact you are up right now
[2:21:04.660 --> 2:21:10.500]  she says I want you to go door-to-door not even their contact tracers not even
[2:21:10.500 --> 2:21:14.380]  their own Clinton Foundation UN intimidators with your cell phone data
[2:21:14.380 --> 2:21:20.820]  that Google and Apple make you have on your phone regardless illegally not
[2:21:20.820 --> 2:21:25.340]  just the weird crazy gay pride armies of folks like we're gay take our shot take
[2:21:25.340 --> 2:21:28.780]  the shot take it like okay okay you're gay you want me to take something my
[2:21:28.780 --> 2:21:35.860]  body to you want to rape me I mean that's how sick the cult of these lost
[2:21:35.860 --> 2:21:39.980]  poor people like I don't hate these people because they're attracted to the
[2:21:39.980 --> 2:21:44.940]  same sex I just like them because they're totally brainwash loser followers
[2:21:44.940 --> 2:21:48.740]  that love the system and will take another body whatever they're told
[2:21:48.740 --> 2:21:53.860]  whenever they're told because they've been separated from God and now when
[2:21:53.860 --> 2:22:00.380]  they're separated from God they become engines to attack my freedoms and then
[2:22:00.380 --> 2:22:09.780]  to come to my door and say put this in your body let me genetically rape you
[2:22:09.780 --> 2:22:15.540]  here's Kamala Harris what to share with people when you're canvassing in your
[2:22:15.540 --> 2:22:20.500]  community to help address their legitimate concerns and needs so for
[2:22:20.500 --> 2:22:24.300]  example if you knock on the door and someone says they don't have the time
[2:22:24.300 --> 2:22:28.340]  to get the vaccine because people are busy they're trying to just make it through
[2:22:28.340 --> 2:22:34.420]  the day or they say that pharmacies are never open when they do have time well
[2:22:34.420 --> 2:22:39.540]  let's address that because now you can let them know that pharmacies across our
[2:22:39.540 --> 2:22:46.620]  country are keeping their doors open for 24 hours on Fridays in June including
[2:22:46.620 --> 2:22:54.180]  today because we need to meet people where they are some folks are working
[2:22:54.180 --> 2:22:59.180]  two jobs some folks are working three jobs so let's figure out how we can make
[2:22:59.180 --> 2:23:04.260]  it accessible for them to get a vaccine when they're able and once they say they
[2:23:04.260 --> 2:23:08.860]  can't miss work well you can tell them that there are employers across the
[2:23:08.860 --> 2:23:14.740]  country who are offering paid time off for their employees to get vaccinated and
[2:23:14.740 --> 2:23:18.860]  we want to encourage so there you go they'll do anything to get you to do
[2:23:18.860 --> 2:23:23.540]  this and then out of the gates heart inflammation heart attacks strokes
[2:23:23.540 --> 2:23:26.940]  death we'll show you the numbers we come back but the smoking gun I've not been
[2:23:26.940 --> 2:23:30.220]  building it up for no reason I'm I'm gonna read the whole thing I'm gonna
[2:23:30.220 --> 2:23:35.500]  show the documents it makes me physically sick it's it's Fauci months before
[2:23:35.500 --> 2:23:39.860]  it was announced COVID was out there saying get your COVID-19 by name virus
[2:23:39.860 --> 2:23:42.580]  vaccine ready because they already had it named they already had it ready they
[2:23:42.580 --> 2:23:45.700]  already had it prepared to come out be the savers of the earth all run out of

[2:29:05.740 --> 2:29:11.980]  science is questioning he said don't question me again last week he helped
[2:29:11.980 --> 2:29:16.820]  set up the major illegal under international law bio weapons labs here
[2:29:16.820 --> 2:29:20.900]  in the United States and in 2015 when there was a major pushback by US
[2:29:20.900 --> 2:29:29.620]  scientists he moved the illegal gain of function coronavirus operation to China
[2:29:29.620 --> 2:29:35.540]  so they could dummy up the records and claim it came out of a zoological area
[2:29:35.540 --> 2:29:39.860]  but it's those documents that showed they were dummy enough to us their attempt
[2:29:39.860 --> 2:29:46.020]  at a cover-up that has covered them up with their own corruption which is now
[2:29:46.020 --> 2:29:51.420]  sinking them to the bottom it's covering up their political grave
[2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:57.180]  burying them six feet under so here's Fauci right after Trump got in saying
[2:29:57.180 --> 2:30:00.580]  don't worry there's gonna be a big pandemic coming there'll be a major
[2:30:00.580 --> 2:30:05.340]  challenge to Trump and you look at the self-satisfied announcement he's like
[2:30:05.340 --> 2:30:10.820]  Hitler announcing the invasion of North Africa or the bombing of Britain I
[2:30:10.820 --> 2:30:15.540]  mean he is as pleased as a pig and you know what here it is if there's one
[2:30:15.540 --> 2:30:21.140]  message that I want to leave with you today based on my experience and you'll
[2:30:21.140 --> 2:30:26.780]  see that in a moment is that there is no question that there will be a challenge
[2:30:26.780 --> 2:30:31.620]  the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases both chronic
[2:30:31.620 --> 2:30:35.460]  infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have
[2:30:35.460 --> 2:30:40.100]  certainly a large burden of that but also there will be a surprise outbreak
[2:30:40.100 --> 2:30:44.820]  and I hope by the end of my relatively short presentation you will understand
[2:30:44.820 --> 2:30:50.460]  why history and the history of the last 32 years that I've been the director of
[2:30:50.460 --> 2:30:55.780]  NIAID will tell the next administration that there's no doubt in anyone's mind
[2:30:55.780 --> 2:30:59.540]  that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors
[2:30:59.540 --> 2:31:05.700]  were faced with so for those so there you go ladies and gentlemen so let's get to
[2:31:05.700 --> 2:31:09.340]  the big news that's been on info wars.com now for over an hour but I've
[2:31:09.340 --> 2:31:12.780]  been giving you some of the backstory and hopefully getting everybody's
[2:31:12.780 --> 2:31:16.980]  attention to share this information and I don't know how you have a hardcore
[2:31:16.980 --> 2:31:21.820]  enough headline. I'm not saying Kellerman Green's headline is a strong enough it's
[2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:26.380]  it's very it's strong it's the truth but it could be more strong because this is
[2:31:26.380 --> 2:31:33.420]  hardcore. Smoking gun question mark. Let's pull the actual article up see if
[2:31:33.420 --> 2:31:36.140]  he's changed that to just smoking gun he can do what he wants he's a writer here
[2:31:36.140 --> 2:31:40.580]  but I'm just saying smoking gun, exclamation point, one month before
[2:31:40.580 --> 2:31:49.880]  COVID outbreaks Fauci and Moderna sent quote quote mRNA coronavirus vaccine
[2:31:49.880 --> 2:31:57.540]  candidates to Wuhan lab linked doctor well he's not just the doctor he was
[2:31:57.540 --> 2:32:01.660]  actual head of the project Peter Dazik was above him but he was the doctor at
[2:32:01.660 --> 2:32:06.900]  Chapel Hill North Carolina that actually ran it. Documents show Anthony Fauci's
[2:32:06.900 --> 2:32:13.500]  NIH and pharma giant Moderna shared mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates that's a
[2:32:13.500 --> 2:32:20.820]  quote with an expert who mentored the Wuhan bat lady and helped test the
[2:32:20.820 --> 2:32:26.340]  COVID vaccine one month before COVID-19 was identified. Originally posted at
[2:32:26.340 --> 2:32:30.620]  Axios last year it's all high to complain to you. Documents revealed that US
[2:32:30.620 --> 2:32:36.540]  government and Moderna teamed up and to send material transfer agreements to
[2:32:36.540 --> 2:32:42.180]  top specialists just days before COVID-19 was leaked in Wuhan, China.
[2:32:42.180 --> 2:32:46.620]  Everyone Fauci got confronted they said you're doing gain of function by
[2:32:46.620 --> 2:32:56.020]  Senator Paul goes that wasn't Chapel Hill not the other plate playing games. The
[2:32:56.020 --> 2:33:00.060]  transfer agreement was signed by multiple parties between December 12th
[2:33:00.060 --> 2:33:07.860]  December 19th 2019 months before we hear about the Wuhan situation. According to
[2:33:07.860 --> 2:33:11.740]  official narrative the World Health Organization WHO became aware of the
[2:33:11.740 --> 2:33:18.660]  pneumonia outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December 31st 2019 but kept it
[2:33:18.660 --> 2:33:23.980]  quiet that's still well ahead of this so that's right on time.
[2:33:23.980 --> 2:33:30.060]  I'm gonna read this in Fauci's voice not until January night 2020 to do release an
[2:33:30.060 --> 2:33:34.780]  official statement regarding the novel coronavirus found in the hospital patient
[2:33:34.780 --> 2:33:39.900]  in Wuhan. One of the signees of the transfer agreement Dr. Ralph Barrick of
[2:33:39.900 --> 2:33:45.300]  UNC Chapel Hill headed up the whole project has extremely close ties with
[2:33:45.300 --> 2:33:50.860]  the Wuhan Institute of Technology. I don't know does my genitals have to do with
[2:33:50.860 --> 2:33:58.740]  my body or maybe my eyes. In the material transfer from me Fauci and Moderna asked
[2:33:58.740 --> 2:34:06.100]  Barrick to perform challenge studies with mRNA vaccine in a redacted model as
[2:34:06.100 --> 2:34:13.100]  described by Exhibit A. So they know this is about to happen they're running
[2:34:13.100 --> 2:34:17.180]  event 201 a month two months before Fauci is with Gates where this exacting
[2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:22.180]  happens out of a city in China a SARS-like disease all of it it was in
[2:34:22.180 --> 2:34:26.980]  crimson contagion a year before that it was in 10 years before that it was in
[2:34:26.980 --> 2:34:31.100]  a lockstep but now it's going from drills and preparations to the real
[2:34:31.100 --> 2:34:40.380]  thing so now it's time to get the vaccine ready. With the level 4 bio weapons lab
[2:34:40.380 --> 2:34:44.980]  connected system at Chapel Hill that's really working for for detrick and
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:49.820]  here's what you don't get anywhere else. As I told you a year and a half ago as I
[2:34:49.820 --> 2:34:55.860]  told you 10 years ago and as Dr. Boyle told you 15 years ago on my show it's
[2:34:55.860 --> 2:35:00.860]  globalist in charge of our bio weapons using Gates and others and Fauci to
[2:35:00.860 --> 2:35:06.340]  transfer it over to the Chinese to a multinational UN lab so they can release
[2:35:06.340 --> 2:35:10.220]  it and attack the world take over the world but the Chinese are like don't
[2:35:10.220 --> 2:35:13.260]  release that we won't be part of the thing if you release it here or if you
[2:35:13.260 --> 2:35:18.260]  release it in America we can blame you we'll do it at a multinational lab that
[2:35:18.260 --> 2:35:23.460]  way it's a multinational lab and so no one will cattle on what they've done
[2:35:23.460 --> 2:35:26.700]  because everybody's involved that's how you get the global government in charge
[2:35:26.700 --> 2:35:30.740]  how corruption works and everybody involved in a smaller corruption now
[2:35:30.740 --> 2:35:35.580]  they'll all support the big corruption and it was J. R. R. Tolkien wrote of the
[2:35:35.580 --> 2:35:39.660]  allegory he was a big Christian but also a world historian about the ring where
[2:35:39.660 --> 2:35:44.220]  Soran makes this many rings for the men this many rings for the elves this many
[2:35:44.220 --> 2:35:47.420]  rings for the dwarves but when they take on those rings they're all controlled
[2:35:47.420 --> 2:35:52.780]  by the one ring you see and that's why they've even had all these different of
[2:35:52.780 --> 2:35:58.140]  instant things where they show us the power of Soran on the all-seeing eye and
[2:35:58.140 --> 2:36:02.340]  so once all these countries and all these groups and all these people have
[2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:09.140]  signed on to the one power well there's a secret that controls it all Satan and
[2:36:09.140 --> 2:36:13.380]  so that's the allegory of the one ring all the other rings and so all these
[2:36:13.380 --> 2:36:18.500]  bio weapon labs give their weapons to this one lab it's released China doubles
[2:36:18.500 --> 2:36:22.620]  a GDP America's in deep trouble everything falls apart they keep us
[2:36:22.620 --> 2:36:27.740]  closed it's all working wonderful their social engineering everything they bring
[2:36:27.740 --> 2:36:31.260]  out the vaccine that carries up the depopulation to get rid of aging US
[2:36:31.260 --> 2:36:35.180]  populations and through the reduced fertility after all China killed 500
[2:36:35.180 --> 2:36:39.740]  million of its people under the one child policy so we're showing China we're
[2:36:39.740 --> 2:36:43.500]  on board look we'll really do it but China this year said we're having three
[2:36:43.500 --> 2:36:47.580]  children now we're not following a new old order we're done thank you and by the
[2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:52.780]  way we control your agents in the United States so just like Hitler and Stalin
[2:36:52.780 --> 2:36:57.260]  turned against each other gates and Fauci in their system that was under
[2:36:57.260 --> 2:37:01.260]  Chinese control the Chinese have thrown them in the wolves and are saying to
[2:37:01.260 --> 2:37:05.460]  Western intelligence go ahead and burn Fauci burn gates we don't care but we
[2:37:05.460 --> 2:37:11.580]  know it came out of Fort Dietrich fence through Chapel Hill sent to China to
[2:37:11.580 --> 2:37:16.620]  then attack America but it wasn't the US military attack this it was globalist
[2:37:16.620 --> 2:37:21.420]  criminals inside working against all nation states and all peoples and that's
[2:37:21.420 --> 2:37:24.700]  why you can't let these bio weapons labs produce this stuff the name of finding
[2:37:24.700 --> 2:37:29.500]  a treatment for a future attack because someone will always use that power a
[2:37:29.500 --> 2:37:33.860]  big corporation a UN a world government who's the winner the UN the big
[2:37:33.860 --> 2:37:37.460]  corporations that's why Apple and Facebook we're all heavily invested in
[2:37:37.460 --> 2:37:41.380]  that very Wuhan operation and then help cover it up because they know the big
[2:37:41.380 --> 2:37:45.020]  bio attack they launched was the future of the world and their takeover what
[2:37:45.020 --> 2:37:48.340]  happens next we'll talk about it straight up
[2:37:50.340 --> 2:37:55.300]  info wars is here because there's a war on for your mind that's why I spent our
[2:37:55.300 --> 2:37:59.740]  motto for more than 25 years and if you research even the UN's own admissions
[2:37:59.740 --> 2:38:04.540]  over 2 billion people on planet Earth out of 7.5 billion have cognitive
[2:38:04.540 --> 2:38:09.260]  disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodine that's why they work to make
[2:38:09.260 --> 2:38:13.620]  sure iodine isn't in the food isn't in the salt anymore now regular iodine that
[2:38:13.620 --> 2:38:18.780]  you find in food is bound to different minerals and so it's hard for your body
[2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:22.780]  to absorb but if you get the proper type of iodine there's three types that are
[2:38:22.780 --> 2:38:26.860]  good for the body it does amazing things it's essential in the body but we have
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:31.260]  our amazing tri iodine a big shipment came in and so we're able to offer it at
[2:38:31.260 --> 2:38:37.260]  the lowest price ever 60% off that is survival shield x3 60% off with three
[2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:42.580]  types of powerful iodine tri iodine is from a patented process that stabilized

[2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:58.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:41:58.680 --> 2:42:16.280]  So these social engineers don't just want to depopulate, quote, save the earth.
[2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:20.880]  They want to play God and genetically engineer every single one of us.
[2:42:20.880 --> 2:42:26.200]  They are psychotic degenerates and most of them are pedophiles by research.
[2:42:26.200 --> 2:42:27.200]  They're demons.
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:28.200]  They're anti-humans.
[2:42:28.200 --> 2:42:29.600]  They're destroying human progress.
[2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:33.800]  They're suppressing us on our arc to the stars to touch the face of God.
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:35.280]  They're in the way of God's plan.
[2:42:35.280 --> 2:42:36.720]  They will be removed.
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:44.800]  So the big article is up on Empowers.com, Smoking Gun, One Month Before COVID Outbreak,
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:51.040]  Fauci and Moderna sent an mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidate to Wuhan lab link doctor.
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:53.520]  He's not link doctor.
[2:42:53.520 --> 2:43:01.480]  He's head of Wuhan projects that was running it out of Chapel Hill and transferred it to
[2:43:01.480 --> 2:43:04.720]  that facility.
[2:43:04.720 --> 2:43:05.840]  And it goes over all of it.
[2:43:05.840 --> 2:43:07.040]  It shows the documents.
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:09.320]  It's all right here.
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:15.240]  And the material transfer from Fauci and Moderna asked Barrick to perform challenge studies.
[2:43:15.240 --> 2:43:20.000]  That means tested on animals and people with an mRNA vaccine, even though they'd already
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:24.520]  done it at UT and found it caused massive death in animals.
[2:43:24.520 --> 2:43:31.840]  Dr. Shia Zhingali, infamously known as the Wuhan Batwoman, was the lead researcher alongside
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:36.320]  Barrick until she leapt the UNC Chapel Hill lab for the Wuhan Institute of Virology in
[2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:37.320]  2015.
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:40.600]  I know as listeners you've heard this 50,000 times, this is in the documents now.
[2:43:40.600 --> 2:43:46.200]  In fact, Bat Lady and Barrick published a paper in 2015 describing a SARS-like cluster of
[2:43:46.200 --> 2:43:51.840]  circulating bat coronaviruses whose potential for human emergence, which they then souped
[2:43:51.840 --> 2:43:53.240]  up.
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:58.000]  How would they know the cluster specifically associated with the Chinese horseshoe bat
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:43:59.680]  shows potential for human emergence?
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:03.960]  Well, in their own words, they built a chimeric, this is a quote, and I played to you Peter
[2:44:03.960 --> 2:44:05.760]  Dazin a few months ago saying this.
[2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:07.080]  No one's picked up on that.
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:14.560]  In their own words, they built a chimeric by encoding a novel zoonotic COV spike protein,
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:18.440]  oh, which they then create the vaccine for, which is the spike proteins in your body.
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:21.120]  See, that's that's that, which in UT already found this.
[2:44:21.120 --> 2:44:22.840]  They already knew what this was going to do.
[2:44:22.840 --> 2:44:25.400]  So they target you with that protein.
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:34.440]  From the SRSHCO-14 COVID sequence, it was isolated from the Chinese horseshoe bats.
[2:44:34.440 --> 2:44:40.360]  Next research is purposely infected human lungs for HAE cultures that were procured under
[2:44:40.360 --> 2:44:47.320]  University of Northern California at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board approval protocols.
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:49.360]  Oh, infecting humans.
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:51.720]  Oh, secret evil testing on humans.
[2:44:51.720 --> 2:44:57.360]  While gain of function research was banned in America 2014, the 2015 Barrick Bat Lady
[2:44:57.360 --> 2:45:02.560]  paper admits continuation of these studies was requested and this has been approved
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:07.280]  by the NIH in all old news to you, but it's in all the public documents now.
[2:45:07.280 --> 2:45:12.760]  He lied to Congress, imagine if Santa Claus was in Congress, he said, do you wear a red
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:13.760]  suit?
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:14.760]  No.
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:15.760]  Do you have a white beard?
[2:45:15.760 --> 2:45:16.760]  No.
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:21.040]  I mean, this is like, this is ridiculous.
[2:45:21.040 --> 2:45:24.880]  Interestingly, a note at the end of the research paper explains the authors originally admitted
[2:45:24.880 --> 2:45:28.760]  the fact that Eco-Help Alliance funded their work.
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:31.240]  Oh, that's Bill Gates and Fauci.
[2:45:31.240 --> 2:45:32.760]  He has the same group.
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:38.240]  Fauci's NIH used a funnel money to the Wuhan Institute of Arrology where Barrick's co-worker,
[2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:40.280]  the Bat Lady, is the lab director.
[2:45:40.280 --> 2:45:46.280]  They also run all the internet fact-checking there and Facebook and Google pay for it.
[2:45:46.280 --> 2:45:51.400]  I mean, they censor you while they kill you and censor treatments while Google knowing
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:45:53.600]  League is like, we want to be in on killing people.
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:55.360]  We want to be in on sterilizing people.
[2:45:55.360 --> 2:45:56.360]  We want to be in on this.
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:45:58.960]  But we got to shut them up while we kill them.
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:45:59.960]  We're liberals.
[2:45:59.960 --> 2:46:01.960]  We're good people.
[2:46:01.960 --> 2:46:02.960]  Wow.
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:06.960]  What a bunch of sickos.
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:11.960]  Wuhan, to investigate the lab leak theory, which is unsurprisingly dismissed.
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:16.760]  In fact, the lead investigator of the WHO investigation, Dazik, determined within three hours of visiting
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:20.160]  the Wuhan lab, but there was nothing to see here.
[2:46:20.160 --> 2:46:24.560]  But Dazik's obvious conflict of interest, growing the Wuhan lab and gaining a function
[2:46:24.560 --> 2:46:28.760]  research, now making headlines, he was just recused from that position.
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:33.120]  He goes on with all the background groups of people that are involved in the CRISPR companies
[2:46:33.120 --> 2:46:37.680]  and how they're splicing everything together and overhead shot.
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:40.960]  Here's all the documents that you got to read that are linked to the article at forewords.com.
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:47.200]  There's the material transfer, public health service, all the documents, all the names,
[2:46:47.200 --> 2:46:52.440]  the COVID transfer, the COVID vaccine, COVID-19, all of it.
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:46:55.440]  And here's Giuseppe Saramala.
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:58.640]  You're not allowed to say Eric Saramala, you can say his name.
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:03.240]  He's a guy heavily involved at all, he now works over at Beam Therapeutics that works
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:04.240]  with the CRISPRs.
[2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:07.640]  Oh, and you got the biolabic guy saying it's fine to inject you with something that makes
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:13.200]  you not be able to eat meat or make your children short because, you know, it's fine, I'm liberal.
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:18.080]  Well, the Senate rejects ban on certain types of human animal experiments, merging humans
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:19.080]  together.
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:22.360]  No big deal, it's all liberal.
[2:47:22.360 --> 2:47:27.560]  Senate votes down legislation and outlaw creation of human animal chimeras.
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:31.760]  So that's where they are, and oh, here they are in 1932 saying they do it.
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:35.380]  We're going to make women wear masks so they get lower oxygen or lower the IQ of their
[2:47:35.380 --> 2:47:37.080]  children to make them dwarf-like.
[2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:41.120]  Well, you're wearing your mask now, aren't you?
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:44.080]  But that's okay, I mean, it's liberal, it's cool.
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:50.320]  Here's Fauci at a conference in 2012, nine years before he lies and says, I've never
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:55.400]  heard a gain of function, we shouldn't study it, no one's studying it, you're a liar, I'm
[2:47:55.400 --> 2:48:01.360]  a scientist, no question me, here it is.
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:08.840]  Always been the issue of gain of function research, not only for influenza, but essentially
[2:48:08.840 --> 2:48:12.480]  for all infectious diseases research.
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:15.320]  Now there are a few ways to look at gain of function research.
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:22.360]  There's the naturally occurring mutations which naturally give gain of function and investigators
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:26.880]  study these effects on the phenotypes of interest.
[2:48:26.880 --> 2:48:33.720]  Does this mutation make something more transmissible, more pathogenic, or adapt to host better?
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:40.760]  Or what historically investigators have done is to actually create gain of function by making
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:47.520]  mutations, passage adaptation, or other newer genetic techniques such as reverse genetics
[2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:50.560]  and genetic reassortment.
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:57.160]  When we do that, often some phenotypes appear and others disappear.
[2:48:57.160 --> 2:49:03.080]  For example, it is commonly seen that when you increase a transmissibility, you may see
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:06.560]  a decrease in pathogenesis, or vice versa.
[2:49:06.560 --> 2:49:12.240]  You may deliberately increase pathogenesis and see a decrease in transmissibility.
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:15.800]  But the bottom line is that gain of function research...
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:22.400]  What Fauci is really doing, though, is they learn different mutations in pigs, and then
[2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:24.480]  in human test subjects they torture the death of China.
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:31.140]  That's going to come out soon with those labs, with the Uyghurs and others, to where they
[2:49:31.140 --> 2:49:36.880]  actually can put it in your body with a higher transmissibility one that then mutates, they've
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:42.200]  already mutated it before, in your body to be more deadly when you give it to others.
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:46.040]  Before the vaccine goes in and triggers a sloughing, but then releases something actually
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:50.000]  deadly, which creates random things, which they then test in the environment and gather
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:55.240]  up to create their real weapon, so they're using us as a giant scout camp to find the
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:49:56.240]  next superweapon.
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:49:59.960]  Oh, now you see, let's continue.
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:02.040]  Genetic reassortment.
[2:50:02.040 --> 2:50:08.640]  When we do that, often some phenotypes appear and others disappear.
[2:50:08.640 --> 2:50:14.600]  For example, it is commonly seen that when you increase a transmissibility, you may see
[2:50:14.600 --> 2:50:18.040]  a decrease in pathogenesis, or vice versa.
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:23.720]  You may deliberately increase pathogenesis and see a decrease in transmissibility.
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:30.000]  But the bottom line is that gain and loss of function research is critical to understanding
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:36.600]  disease pathogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and host responses, as well as to developing
[2:50:36.600 --> 2:50:44.120]  better techniques of surveillance, vaccines, and therapeutics, specifically to gain a function
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:50:47.680]  research on HPAI H5N1.
[2:50:47.680 --> 2:50:53.360]  What we're talking about now is the gain of function research in studies that increase
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:59.280]  predominantly the transmissibility, as was the case that I'm going to get into in a moment,
[2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:03.480]  as well as pathogenesis and alteration of host range of the virus.
[2:51:03.480 --> 2:51:06.760]  Okay, so this is an ongoing program he's running.
[2:51:06.760 --> 2:51:09.960]  He gets in front of Congress and says, I've never done that, I'm not involved.
[2:51:09.960 --> 2:51:13.680]  A lying, horrible, mass murdering criminal that thinks you're an idiot and thinks you'll
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:15.320]  never figure out what he's done.
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:16.320]  So there you go.
[2:51:16.320 --> 2:51:21.160]  But what has been done, and what's come out now on infowars.com and Axios and these documents
[2:51:21.160 --> 2:51:23.600]  is the smoking gun.
[2:51:23.600 --> 2:51:28.400]  A month before it's announced that COVID-19's out there, he calls the lab that they do their
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:34.840]  illegal research in China, and he runs and finds and says, get ready for an mRNA vaccine
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:40.000]  for a transmissible through the air coronavirus right now, get it ready.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:43.520]  So that again, they can be the savior and bring it over here for everyone after they
[2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:47.840]  were the ones that clearly did the illegal testing, created it, and then released it
[2:51:47.840 --> 2:51:49.960]  right at the time to embarrass Trump and everybody else.
[2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:55.800]  As Fauci admits, Trump will be challenged by this new novel virus because they had cooked
[2:51:55.800 --> 2:52:01.600]  the whole thing up, and Fauci owns part of all four of the major approved vaccines in
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:03.920]  the United States along with Billy Boy Gates.
[2:52:03.920 --> 2:52:06.480]  I don't get that type of Bill Gates money, I don't want it.
[2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:11.920]  I got you supporting and funding us, got some new great free American t-shirts with big old
[2:52:11.920 --> 2:52:17.640]  American flags on them, and the Save the Frog shirts, and it's the last day to get our multivitamin,
[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:23.200]  our vitamin C mega-dose with the zinc and our D3 with the calcium.
[2:52:23.200 --> 2:52:26.080]  All three of those are 40% off of free shipping double bakery points.
[2:52:26.080 --> 2:52:28.920]  That will be over tomorrow, got to end that sale.
[2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:33.200]  The ultimate crude oil is back in stock along with X3, and of course, Bob Russelinium.
[2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:35.880]  X3 is 60% off, that sale's got to end in one week.
[2:52:35.880 --> 2:52:39.120]  We'll be right back with hour number four in my Gata.
[2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:44.560]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist,
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:49.200]  their attack on humanity, I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure, and
[2:52:49.200 --> 2:52:53.160]  we've given the globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[2:52:53.160 --> 2:52:56.640]  I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[2:52:56.640 --> 2:52:57.640]  a break.
[2:52:57.640 --> 2:52:58.640]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:02.440]  I've always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil
[2:53:02.440 --> 2:53:03.440]  is so clear.
[2:53:03.440 --> 2:53:04.440]  I get it.
[2:53:04.440 --> 2:53:07.120]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches, a lot of you have been turned off
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:12.280]  by the corrupt priest class system, and I get it, me too, believe me, I'm one of them,
[2:53:12.280 --> 2:53:18.560]  but it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so
[2:53:18.560 --> 2:53:19.560]  essential.
[2:53:19.560 --> 2:53:24.400]  God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life, and so
[2:53:24.400 --> 2:53:27.640]  that's what M-Full Wars is really all about, so thank you all for your word of mouth.
[2:53:27.640 --> 2:53:31.160]  Thank you for spreading the word about M-Full Wars, and thank you for supporting us to
[2:53:31.160 --> 2:53:35.800]  keep us on air by visiting M-FullWarsStore.com because without your daily and weekly monthly
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:45.480]  purchases, we'll be taking off the air, so thank you for the support M-FullWarsStore.com.
[2:53:45.480 --> 2:53:51.280]  Thank you so much for being here.
[2:53:51.280 --> 2:53:54.280]  I'm going to go ahead and say, I love your products.
[2:53:54.280 --> 2:53:57.600]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:53:57.600 --> 2:54:03.280]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called, but
[2:54:03.280 --> 2:54:09.080]  since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:15.200]  People think I'm 55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:18.960]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[2:54:18.960 --> 2:54:23.280]  situation, but when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:28.680]  you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket,
[2:54:28.680 --> 2:54:34.600]  this is working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore,
[2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:44.200]  you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:54:44.200 --> 2:54:51.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:57.920]  All right, it's Mike Adams tomorrow.
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:54:58.920]  We switched it.
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:54:59.920]  He does a great job.
[2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:03.400]  So Jay Dyer, Jay Dyer is about to take over, I've got a question for Jay Dyer.
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:06.000]  Smart guy when it comes to the great reset, the New World Order, come up here in about
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:11.200]  five minutes, but I wanted to air this piece, this again for people that haven't seen it,
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:16.000]  because whoever wrote this, I've not seen the authors, they don't have a globalist background,
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:17.520]  might have been a good person trying to warn us.
[2:55:17.520 --> 2:55:22.560]  It was a book like 13 years ago, got turned into a TV show a few years later, it's been
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:29.720]  redone last year, it was called Utopia 2013, now it's a Utopia 2020, but they're really
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:34.260]  warning you about what the globalists have actually done, eerily accurate, but it turns
[2:55:34.260 --> 2:55:39.400]  out they're a UN funded sterilization vaccines and other things that talked about using auto
[2:55:39.400 --> 2:55:42.880]  immune response to proteins in the uterus to actually do this.
[2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:47.720]  That's why Wolfgang Wudar, Glastier and others top scientists warned against exactly this,
[2:55:47.720 --> 2:55:49.600]  but here it is in fiction.
[2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:53.800]  How much evil do you have to do to do good?
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:56:00.320]  You've desecrated all of my work, you've disrespected science.
[2:56:00.320 --> 2:56:02.200]  What the hell did you put in that vaccine?
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:08.120]  He created a fluid spark that demand for a vaccine that doesn't work.
[2:56:08.120 --> 2:56:09.680]  After everyone in the country's vaccination.
[2:56:09.680 --> 2:56:10.680]  And the world?
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:12.400]  He'll have murdered millions.
[2:56:12.400 --> 2:56:13.680]  Nope, nope, you don't have it.
[2:56:13.680 --> 2:56:18.280]  You have a certain percentage of the population of fatal illness, and you make sure it's genetic.
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:22.400]  See that was the exciting part, you pass it down, so if you have children before you
[2:56:22.400 --> 2:56:23.400]  die.
[2:56:23.400 --> 2:56:29.280]  And when this vaccine fails, I'll be the scapegoat.
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:32.040]  People are driven by the need to know what happens next.
[2:56:32.040 --> 2:56:37.600]  Do you want to know what happens next?
[2:56:37.600 --> 2:56:46.800]  Your father created a world-changing, not world-ending, a world-changing, world-improving
[2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:47.800]  omni-virus.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:53.640]  And we have taken that virus and embedded it in the vaccine at this church clue.
[2:56:53.640 --> 2:56:55.640]  I know it.
[2:56:55.640 --> 2:56:56.640]  I know it.
[2:56:56.640 --> 2:56:59.040]  He created a panic, and now everybody's begging for the vaccine.
[2:56:59.040 --> 2:57:01.080]  No, no, no, demanding it.
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:02.880]  Yes.
[2:57:02.880 --> 2:57:07.560]  And now we have exactly what we want, hundreds of millions of Americans lining up, offering
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:11.120]  us their arms, and letting us give them our creation.
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:14.920]  I'm pretty sure when every vaccinated person starts dying, they'll trace it back to you,
[2:57:14.920 --> 2:57:16.520]  undetectable virus or not.
[2:57:16.520 --> 2:57:17.520]  You've all been very busy.
[2:57:17.520 --> 2:57:18.520]  You're all very sharp.
[2:57:18.520 --> 2:57:19.520]  Are you sure?
[2:57:19.520 --> 2:57:21.520]  What if you'd like to come and work for me?
[2:57:21.520 --> 2:57:22.520]  No?
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:26.920]  Better than dying, terrible, violent death?
[2:57:26.920 --> 2:57:30.840]  Don't understand this.
[2:57:30.840 --> 2:57:34.440]  What we are doing is far bigger than death.
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:37.720]  Wait, this virus is not deadly.
[2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:41.640]  It looks pretty damn deadly.
[2:57:41.640 --> 2:57:42.640]  Tell me this.
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:50.320]  What have you done today to earn your place in this crowded world?
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:51.320]  Exactly.
[2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:55.440]  Everything I do is a cure for our current situation.
[2:57:55.440 --> 2:57:58.080]  And how's it a cure if you're killing people?
[2:57:58.080 --> 2:58:00.320]  I told you it does not kill.
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:03.360]  That was the amazing epiphany we had.
[2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:07.480]  We didn't have to kill to accomplish our goal.
[2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:13.480]  We intend to stop human reproduction for three generations.
[2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:22.760]  The busy, endless global assembly line of babies will grind to old.
[2:58:22.760 --> 2:58:25.680]  You're sterilizing people?
[2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:26.680]  Uh-huh.
[2:58:26.680 --> 2:58:31.720]  The first five years will start to see major birth rate declines as teenagers vaccinated
[2:58:31.720 --> 2:58:33.720]  and stay at their child-bearing years.
[2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:36.160]  You're controlling the future of human civilization.
[2:58:36.160 --> 2:58:37.720]  Is that what they're calling it?
[2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:42.000]  It's a very nice euphemism for a species that is replicated like a contagion across the
[2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:47.840]  planet killing all other species in its wake, except things that are cute like puppies or
[2:58:47.840 --> 2:58:48.840]  claws.
[2:58:48.840 --> 2:58:50.600]  You hate people that much?
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:52.320]  On the contrary, I love people.
[2:58:52.320 --> 2:58:53.320]  Then how?
[2:58:53.320 --> 2:58:56.960]  Why would doing what our government or citizenry is to spoil or self-indulgent to do?
[2:58:56.960 --> 2:58:59.840]  We are saving ourselves from ourselves.
[2:58:59.840 --> 2:59:05.640]  100 years ago, the global population was 1.7 billion.
[2:59:05.640 --> 2:59:08.600]  2011, it reached 7 billion.
[2:59:08.600 --> 2:59:11.280]  What this is is a seduction.
[2:59:11.280 --> 2:59:13.600]  By the way, they always lie to their lower people.
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:15.000]  I explained this a thousand times.
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:18.280]  I'm not just applying this to this story to make it sound like I've already predicted
[2:59:18.280 --> 2:59:19.880]  that everybody knows this.
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:23.160]  They told people, oh, we're just getting rid of half the population in the 60s, then 80%,
[2:59:23.160 --> 2:59:24.160]  then 90%.
[2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:28.720]  The internal documents are basically 100% post-human world.
[2:59:28.720 --> 2:59:33.680]  They tell the kind of mid-level folks, oh, we're sterilizing everybody with a new vaccine.
[2:59:33.680 --> 2:59:36.280]  And the death society effect, no, it's meant to kill people too.
[2:59:36.280 --> 2:59:38.720]  So they're killing folks and sterilizing them.
[2:59:38.720 --> 2:59:39.720]  It's here.
[2:59:39.720 --> 2:59:41.280]  You're inside it now, folks.
[2:59:41.280 --> 2:59:42.280]  So guard your life.
[2:59:42.280 --> 2:59:50.440]  We'll be right back with Jay Dyer, stay with us.
[2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:55.600]  Scientist's degree, magnesium is the most important cofactor in the body, regulating
[2:59:55.600 --> 2:59:59.120]  and controlling hundreds of pathways.
[2:59:59.120 --> 3:00:02.280]  Magnesium is required for your body to do the following.
[3:00:02.280 --> 3:00:08.240]  Helps convert food into energy, helps with muscle contraction function, helps regulate
[3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:13.440]  the nervous system, helps with protein building in the muscles, and so much more.
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:19.200]  And now it's available in this concentrated form of ionized, fizzy magnesium.
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:20.400]  It tastes great.
[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:21.600]  I take it in the morning.
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:23.120]  I take it in the evening.
[3:00:23.120 --> 3:00:28.240]  It is so essential in my life, and I hope all of you will check it out and try it.
[3:00:28.240 --> 3:00:31.360]  It's available at infowarstore.com right now.
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:35.080]  This is the best formula from our research you're going to find out there.
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:39.200]  So if you've already enjoyed other magnesium formulas, give this one a try.
[3:00:39.200 --> 3:00:42.560]  I think you're going to love it at the same time it funds the Info War, which is a true
[3:00:42.560 --> 3:00:43.560]  360 win.
[3:00:43.560 --> 3:00:58.200]  It's now exclusively available at infowarstore.com for only $19.95.
[3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:02.600]  Waging war on corruption.
[3:01:02.600 --> 3:01:08.680]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:16.680]  All right, Jay Dyer is a TV host and a really well-researched author.
[3:01:16.680 --> 3:01:20.320]  Jay's at alzones.com, and he's taking over this hour.
[3:01:20.320 --> 3:01:21.800]  I appreciate him doing it today.
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:25.360]  I was going to host the hour, but I've got very important things that I've got to finish
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:27.560]  that I can't do on air.
[3:01:27.560 --> 3:01:31.680]  And then we've got Mike Adams hosting tomorrow, but we're making a lot of big announcements
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:33.920]  soon about some of the things we're doing, all the things that are unfolding.
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:37.760]  But I wanted to ask Jay before I turned the baton over to him, the microphone over to
[3:01:37.760 --> 3:01:43.440]  him, his view on the paradox, because, you know, if you talk to a globalist and they
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:47.280]  put this on their writings, let's have that something tell me in my face, one of them
[3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:50.440]  even in front of the producer, which wasn't off record, so I can tell the story, that
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:51.800]  the public doesn't want your help.
[3:01:51.800 --> 3:01:55.280]  There are a bunch of dumb animals, and we're just really sad about this, but you need to
[3:01:55.280 --> 3:01:57.160]  join us, and we're going to try to save the earth.
[3:01:57.160 --> 3:02:01.400]  And it's kind of like you live out in the country, and people dump a bunch of wild dogs
[3:02:01.400 --> 3:02:02.400]  out there.
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:05.040]  There's 20 of them running around, eating each other, and, you know, a lot of the farmers
[3:02:05.040 --> 3:02:06.040]  just go out there and shoot them.
[3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:08.240]  What do you do, spate them and keep them all?
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:09.240]  Or cats.
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:13.200]  Cats get overpopulated, you know, you're like, oh, the local animal shelters, you know, killing
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:16.360]  thousands of cats a month in Austin, isn't that terrible?
[3:02:16.360 --> 3:02:19.120]  Well, nobody's taking care of them.
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:23.360]  But then you study the globalists, they're so inbred and evil, and almost all their kids
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:26.520]  commit suicide and are into transgenderism.
[3:02:26.520 --> 3:02:30.800]  I mean, I know some of these people, I know folks who know the other ones, they're all
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:34.880]  extremely depressed, extremely unhappy, and they just want to kill everybody.
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:38.760]  They've got their excuse of like, oh, we've got to get rid of everybody, you know, to
[3:02:38.760 --> 3:02:39.760]  save the earth.
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:44.640]  But again, as I said, 50 years ago, they taught we've got to cut the population by half, then
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:49.720]  it was 70%, 80%, 90% in public documents, you know, famous Georgia guide stones put
[3:02:49.720 --> 3:02:54.280]  up by Ted Turner, so it's 500 million.
[3:02:54.280 --> 3:02:57.880]  But now they say, oh, transhumanism, we want all humans gone, they're a scourge, humans
[3:02:57.880 --> 3:03:04.720]  are bad, and it's all people like Webster Hubble's daughter that are pushing this.
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:05.720]  Like, how about you go?
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:09.000]  I mean, I'm not going to come attack Chelsea Clinton.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:13.640]  I don't want to even, the point is, you want me to die, you've been caught giving us deadly
[3:03:13.640 --> 3:03:19.640]  vaccines, you're doing all this, you're imploding the world economy, flooding us with third
[3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:24.280]  world populations, you then teach to hate white people, so white people will then become
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:27.760]  tribal to defend themselves and survive, and then you've got what you want.
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:33.240]  We wipe them out, you wipe us out, and then Pelosi and her evil daughter, these selfish
[3:03:33.240 --> 3:03:37.680]  monsters go forward.
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:41.480]  Years ago it was estimated, even by the federal budget office, congressional budget office,
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:47.080]  that there was over two quadrillion in fake money worldwide, a lot of it to the U.S.
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:50.640]  Now it's probably 10 times that money velocity.
[3:03:50.640 --> 3:03:56.000]  So they created enough money to buy the world hundreds of times.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:03.200]  Every car, every building, every painting, every piece of gold, hundreds of times.
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:04.920]  So they're looking at it going, well, what do we do?
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:07.240]  Well, they collapse the economy, they do lockdowns.
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:11.080]  To make what's left of the economy implodes, we've got to go more into debt to them, because
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:14.960]  the debt has no value until we are in debt and have to get it from them.
[3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:18.120]  And then, oh, you've got to take an inoculation to get this money, you've got to have a social
[3:04:18.120 --> 3:04:21.640]  credit score, you've got to do what we say, you've got to have a vaccine passport, and
[3:04:21.640 --> 3:04:24.400]  then they admit that's their plan.
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:27.880]  And look, it takes a lot to shake me up, we're going to J. Dyer on this, this is my question.
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:32.840]  I went to New York for three days, got a lot of stuff done publicly and behind the scenes,
[3:04:32.840 --> 3:04:36.320]  and I went to the U.N., and I didn't even know this was up there, big, giant paintings.
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:41.000]  We're going to put out in the next few days, you're going to shoot a whole report, saying
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:47.600]  you will soon own nothing, you will have nothing, just like Davos says, but it got worse.
[3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:52.400]  It then said you will soon live in a commune, not a city, not a house, not an apartment,
[3:04:52.400 --> 3:04:55.560]  and it showed people in a concentration camp.
[3:04:55.560 --> 3:05:01.160]  It showed concrete bunkers and people in a camp.
[3:05:01.160 --> 3:05:04.240]  So what's the psychology, instead of saying, oh, it's the utopia we're going to build
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:08.240]  for you, everything's free, they go, you will soon live in an open-air camp.
[3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:11.240]  You will eat bugs, you will get no meat, you will drink sewage.
[3:05:11.240 --> 3:05:16.360]  These are statements on the wall, and I was there with the off-duty New York police, we
[3:05:16.360 --> 3:05:19.200]  had a security, they hadn't been down there, they're like, what the hell's this?
[3:05:19.200 --> 3:05:22.400]  They thought it was a joke.
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:24.480]  My camera guy was like, did we put this up?
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:25.880]  This looks just like a joke.
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:30.080]  No, it's not a joke, so what is the psychology behind that, J. Dyer, let me ask you this
[3:05:30.080 --> 3:05:35.120]  first question, what is the paradox of those of us that know this is going on, know we
[3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:38.880]  lose our soul if we become these globalists trying to kill everybody, plus we know they're
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:42.600]  going to get us too, we're lying, pretending we're them, they're all going to be betrayed
[3:05:42.600 --> 3:05:44.480]  by this evil.
[3:05:44.480 --> 3:05:48.600]  What is the paradox, as now we're inside the nightmare, the trap is shut, it's just now
[3:05:48.600 --> 3:05:52.440]  beginning, and all these idiots are going along with it, who really do deserve to be
[3:05:52.440 --> 3:05:57.600]  destroyed, but see, because it's not Satan in control, and it's not humans in control.
[3:05:57.600 --> 3:06:01.800]  That is letting these forces play out through free will, and it's a test, so all these idiots
[3:06:01.800 --> 3:06:07.360]  that ran like teachers' pets to give an apple to Satan, he already gave us the apple, thinking
[3:06:07.360 --> 3:06:12.840]  oh, we're teachers' pets, let us rule, he's only the tester, they're fools, aren't they?
[3:06:12.840 --> 3:06:17.720]  Yeah, absolutely, I think the key here is understanding that what we're dealing with
[3:06:17.720 --> 3:06:24.080]  ultimately is a spiritual battle, it's not just a battle against oligarchical money elites,
[3:06:24.080 --> 3:06:27.560]  that's one strata of what we're dealing with, but at the top of that pyramid above the
[3:06:27.560 --> 3:06:34.080]  top layer there is something spiritual, it's the eye in that pyramid is a spiritual entity.
[3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:37.080]  That's why the eye is levitating, it's not of this world.
[3:06:37.080 --> 3:06:42.480]  Exactly, it's a spiritual dimension that goes beyond the physical, and in that dimension,
[3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:47.680]  which I think is the fallen angelic realm, you have a spiritual power, a fallen cherub
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:54.360]  according to Ezekiel 28, who is envious of mankind because of the destiny that man has.
[3:06:54.360 --> 3:06:59.480]  This became incarnate in our theology and Christian theology to raise man to a status
[3:06:59.480 --> 3:07:04.040]  of immortality, and Satan and his rebellious angels were envious of that, they did not
[3:07:04.040 --> 3:07:10.440]  want to partake of that, and so they rebelled and so they have it out to destroy humankind,
[3:07:10.440 --> 3:07:16.640]  and that's, it's no accident that the elites who go into their, you know, trance states
[3:07:16.640 --> 3:07:21.560]  and who go into these demonic states, all these LSD states, and get this information
[3:07:21.560 --> 3:07:27.240]  literally from clockwork elves, from the entities, they all say, you got to depopulate, why is
[3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:32.480]  it, it's not an accident, right, if you go watch 50 videos of people who've done DMT,
[3:07:32.480 --> 3:07:37.200]  right, on YouTube, almost all of them will say that they got the same message, oh dude,
[3:07:37.200 --> 3:07:41.760]  I was in the DMT dimension and the clockwork elves told me to form a world government
[3:07:41.760 --> 3:07:45.400]  and like depopulate and stuff, dude, and then everything will be fixed.
[3:07:45.400 --> 3:07:50.080]  Why is it the same message, exactly, right, so Paul was telling us 2000 years ago, right,
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:55.880]  in Ephesians 6, that the real power is a spiritual battle and most people who are in the matrix,
[3:07:55.880 --> 3:08:00.400]  the people that are going along with this system, they're spiritually deluded and blinded,
[3:08:00.400 --> 3:08:04.400]  and until they repent, until they come out of this, they can't see the big picture, the
[3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:08.280]  real metaphysical battle that's going on.
[3:08:08.280 --> 3:08:11.800]  You're absolutely right, so what do we do about the fools that aren't Satanists but
[3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:13.560]  are caught under his spell?
[3:08:13.560 --> 3:08:17.480]  Well, we keep doing what we're doing, right, I mean, the more that we point this out, the
[3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:23.040]  more that we show the truth, the more that we give a coherent narrative, right, because
[3:08:23.040 --> 3:08:27.080]  they're not hearing a coherent story, they're hearing constant contradiction, they're being
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:31.760]  brutalized by that O'Brien methodology of constant gaslighting and lying and getting
[3:08:31.760 --> 3:08:35.840]  you to buy further into the lie, and you're right, there is a paradox in that, you know,
[3:08:35.840 --> 3:08:41.640]  in God's providence, if you go along willingly with the evil, you get what you paid for.
[3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:46.320]  We're at the juncture now where it's no longer theory, it's not just theoretical arguments
[3:08:46.320 --> 3:08:51.120]  around the Thanksgiving table to debate with your so-called conspiracy theory relatives
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:56.960]  or whatever, it's now the rubber meets the road where if you don't get into reality and
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:03.200]  choose the delusion in your head, right, to follow Fauci and his incarnation of science,
[3:09:03.200 --> 3:09:07.800]  I am science, you know what I say, I'm science, right, he sounds like a diner waitress, like
[3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:11.360]  I feel like he should be getting me more tater tots, or getting me more tater tots with that
[3:09:11.360 --> 3:09:15.160]  MRNA or whatever, I mean, this guy is ridiculous, he's playing it.
[3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:17.160]  No, don't do it.
[3:09:17.160 --> 3:09:21.320]  Powerful, I appreciate you taking over my friend, what do you make of the smoking gun,
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:25.880]  we now learn that Fauci had him making the COVID-19 vaccine a month before they announced
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:27.600]  COVID-19, I mean, smoking gun.
[3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:31.160]  Oh yeah, exactly, yeah, that's amazing, good work, and I mean, that just fits perfectly
[3:09:31.160 --> 3:09:35.480]  in with the rest of the smoking guns, it's just another in this long line of things
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:41.840]  that obviously show foreknowledge, planning, strategy, you've got five known exercises,
[3:09:41.840 --> 3:09:45.920]  which we've covered many times, you've covered the whole documentary, we've got Cladex, we've
[3:09:45.920 --> 3:09:51.840]  got Crimson Contagion, we've got Spars, we've got Event 2.1, we've got Lockstep, and now
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:55.520]  we've got even more evidence, it should be open and shut, it should have already been
[3:09:55.520 --> 3:10:01.200]  open and shut, but yes, that's awesome, you had another open and shut where we have foreknowledge,
[3:10:01.200 --> 3:10:04.320]  we have planning, we have strategy, we have them participating.
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:10.800]  But as you know, even the Crimson Contagion and the Spars drills have it coming out,
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:14.120]  they're even prepared the drills that it's going to come out, that it's deadly and the
[3:10:14.120 --> 3:10:15.120]  rest of it.
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:19.640]  Exactly, and then to blame it on, right, the government stooges and kind of the low-level
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:23.880]  people while the gates are immune, right, this is called function stacking where you
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:29.320]  have one operation that serves multiple purposes, right, so it's not just a big money operation
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:35.280]  to make billions, it's also a long-term, right, experimentation, depopulation strategy.
[3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:40.760]  All right, you're taking over, Jay Dyer, jasonamelsis.com, and then The War Room with Omen Shroyer

[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:17.920]  Welcome back to Fauci's Diner.
[3:13:17.920 --> 3:13:18.920]  I'm your waitress.
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:26.680]  Could I get you any Virginia Slims or perhaps a box of wine with those tater tots?
[3:13:26.680 --> 3:13:28.280]  Welcome to Fauci's Diner.
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:34.800]  Please get your mandated stabby at the door and help yourself over to the salad bar and
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:36.880]  get lots of cool slaw.
[3:13:36.880 --> 3:13:42.160]  Yes, Fauci definitely sounds like a diner waitress.
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:48.800]  Now, we were talking about mutations and we were talking about different plans in the
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:55.960]  past that I've been on, and I wanted to kind of follow up with what I see the UFO alien
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:58.000]  Psyop to be.
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:03.080]  So, you know, Alex has had quite a few guests on, I think, either John Bowner or Greg Reese
[3:14:03.080 --> 3:14:07.160]  have done some reports which were really good highlighting some of these topics, and I've
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:12.800]  got quite a bit of information on this because I did several sections in my book on the notion
[3:14:12.800 --> 3:14:14.880]  of alien propaganda.
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:17.240]  Why is Hollywood so married to this?
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:21.560]  Is it just to make money or is there a deeper agenda at work here?
[3:14:21.560 --> 3:14:26.240]  And it relates to the great reset because even to my surprise, right, in that video that
[3:14:26.240 --> 3:14:30.800]  we saw earlier where, you know, four years ago the World Economic Forum put out a viral
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:35.400]  video on Twitter saying, here's the eight or ten things that will be, you know, the
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:38.360]  characteristic events in the next ten years.
[3:14:38.360 --> 3:14:43.840]  You will see alien life, I think was number five or six or so in that sequence.
[3:14:43.840 --> 3:14:49.280]  And in my book, I did a whole analysis of a Brookings Institute document, and this is
[3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:53.720]  actually from, you know, one of the top think tanks, there's a famous academic, her name's
[3:14:53.720 --> 3:14:54.720]  Brenda Denzler.
[3:14:54.720 --> 3:15:01.760]  I wrote a book on UFO cults and the manipulation and social engineering that could be used,
[3:15:01.760 --> 3:15:07.400]  could be had through alien cults and alien engineering.
[3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:13.280]  And in this 1968 NASA Brookings Institute report, it says, quote, the Christian religion
[3:15:13.280 --> 3:15:18.680]  would be particularly compromised by the discovery of extraterrestrial life since it makes so
[3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:23.960]  much of the incarnation of Christ as a historical event and of the knowledge of the good news
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:28.960]  of Jesus Christ, passion, ascension, and atonement as the Simquanon of salvation.
[3:15:28.960 --> 3:15:33.120]  This fact would thus be irreconcilable with divine providence.
[3:15:33.120 --> 3:15:39.040]  Again, that's from a 1968 NASA Brookings Institute report.
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:44.760]  Now if the elite, the strategists, the social engineers have known that since the sixties,
[3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:50.560]  I think it's a good bet that when we look at the history of the so-called UFO phenomenon,
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:56.040]  the outbreak of all these sightings and whatnot, going back to the forties, certain people
[3:15:56.040 --> 3:16:00.360]  in certain events were chosen to be actually propped up, the first of which of course
[3:16:00.360 --> 3:16:02.560]  is the George Adamski story, right?
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:07.480]  He's one of the first close encounter abductee type persons where he had this, you know,
[3:16:07.480 --> 3:16:09.680]  direct encounter.
[3:16:09.680 --> 3:16:15.600]  And then it was later outed that this was curiously parallel to a science fiction book
[3:16:15.600 --> 3:16:18.080]  that had been written around the same time.
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:22.400]  And so a lot of people started calling out George Adamski as a fraud, and none other
[3:16:22.400 --> 3:16:27.600]  than the head of the CIA himself, I believe it was Helms, stepped up to the plate to prosecute
[3:16:27.600 --> 3:16:34.440]  anybody who would call out or question the narrative of George Adamski.
[3:16:34.440 --> 3:16:38.600]  Soon after that you have the story of Betty and Barney Hill, they're another early case
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:44.520]  of abductees, and what do you know, Betty and Barney Hill go on to start an alien cult.
[3:16:44.520 --> 3:16:51.360]  Now the interplay between intelligence agencies, cults, psychological operations, and alien
[3:16:51.360 --> 3:16:56.000]  phenomena is always there, there's always this link, they're always in the background,
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:02.120]  and in fact some of the biggest cults of the 20th century have what you can call exo theology.
[3:17:02.120 --> 3:17:07.800]  All that means is space opera, it means a theology of space or a mythology of the planets
[3:17:07.800 --> 3:17:14.080]  and the beings or the entities or the interdimensional angels, whatever you want to call it, which
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:19.400]  are really just replacements for aliens, they're all talking about basically the same thing.
[3:17:19.400 --> 3:17:23.520]  And as I mentioned to Alex, there's this notion of what's called function stacking,
[3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:28.640]  we saw that with the Coofit and all that nonsense, that it serves multiple purposes and multiple
[3:17:28.640 --> 3:17:29.640]  agendas.
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:34.840]  Well, the UFO phenomenon bears all of those same patterns of function stacking, multiple
[3:17:34.840 --> 3:17:36.360]  use cases.
[3:17:36.360 --> 3:17:42.880]  So early on, in say the Cold War period, the UFO phenomenon served as a good deflection,
[3:17:42.880 --> 3:17:51.440]  and it was a red herring, right, to dupe foreign analysis, to cover for maybe experimental
[3:17:51.440 --> 3:17:55.080]  stealth aircraft that were being developed, right, the stealth bomber or whatever.
[3:17:55.080 --> 3:17:59.800]  And in fact, a famous CIA operative, Miles Copeland, was actually involved in staging
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:06.000]  some of these events back in the 60s to dupe the Chinese, believe it or not, and it worked
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:11.600]  so well that the information that was intended to dupe the Chinese came back domestically
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:16.960]  to the U.S. in the 60s, and an early UFO alien cult sprung out of that.
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:23.280]  And this cult, by the way, tacked on a new gospel to the Bible, which detailed the alien
[3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:24.280]  rapture.
[3:18:24.280 --> 3:18:28.760]  So they actually co-opted this dispensationalist evangelical doctrine of the rapture and tied
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:33.440]  that into the alien mythology, oh, the space brothers are going to come, they're going
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:38.600]  to beam you up into the ship or whatever.
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:43.480]  One thinks immediately here of, right, Heaven's Gate, Marshall Applewhite, right, and definitely
[3:18:43.480 --> 3:18:48.040]  there are fed connections, believe it or not, to the Heaven's Gate cult.
[3:18:48.040 --> 3:18:52.760]  Jim Jones' cult had an exo-theology space component, a lot of people don't know this,
[3:18:52.760 --> 3:18:58.240]  but actually Jim Jones said that the universe was part of this big space opera, and if people
[3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:04.400]  followed his cult and they followed his dictates, they would be led into the heavenly vaults,
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:07.680]  the many mansions, right, so they take these verses in the Bible, and the many mansions,
[3:19:07.680 --> 3:19:10.640]  that means space brothers, that means aliens, right?
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:12.240]  But the pattern is always the same, right?
[3:19:12.240 --> 3:19:16.960]  We see intelligence agencies in the background, deep state people, and it's not surprising
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:21.600]  because where does the alien mythos in the 20th century actually come from?
[3:19:21.600 --> 3:19:26.960]  Does it come from people who saw strange unexplained phenomena, which definitely exists?
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:33.240]  Sure, there's a lot of inexplicable stellar spatial phenomena, but does it follow from
[3:19:33.240 --> 3:19:38.080]  that, that it's therefore space brothers or extra-biological ETs?
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:42.600]  No, that's a non-sequitur, right, and largely that's a, no, it doesn't follow.
[3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:48.160]  So the fact that there's inexplicable phenomena doesn't automatically lead to the conclusion
[3:19:48.160 --> 3:19:52.640]  that it's beings from other planets who are biological entities who evolved like us or
[3:19:52.640 --> 3:19:53.640]  something.
[3:19:53.640 --> 3:19:55.400]  But why does so many people think that it does?
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:20:01.320]  Why does so many people think that strange aerial phenomenon automatically leads to extra-biological
[3:20:01.320 --> 3:20:02.320]  entities?
[3:20:02.320 --> 3:20:04.600]  What is the role that Hollywood played?
[3:20:04.600 --> 3:20:09.080]  This is the role that the science fiction machine played.
[3:20:09.080 --> 3:20:11.600]  Where does the science fiction machine derive its origins?
[3:20:11.600 --> 3:20:16.280]  Well, for us in the 20th century, there's no other figure more important than H.G.
[3:20:16.280 --> 3:20:17.280]  Wells.
[3:20:17.280 --> 3:20:23.920]  So I've been going back and reading some of these fiction works by Wells, Orwell, Huxley,
[3:20:23.920 --> 3:20:28.000]  and it's amazing at the multifunction level that these books played, right?
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:31.440]  So they're not just kind of telling you at one level what's going on.
[3:20:31.440 --> 3:20:37.640]  They're really setting the stage for the inculcation of a new paradigm, a new worldview.
[3:20:37.640 --> 3:20:42.000]  Just as that Brookings Institute document said, we'll institute a new paradigm, a new
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:46.760]  worldview based around an alien mythology.
[3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:48.040]  Aliens seeded us here.
[3:20:48.040 --> 3:20:52.480]  We're just the creation of alien engineers, right, like out of Ridley Scott's Prometheus,
[3:20:52.480 --> 3:20:53.480]  literally.
[3:20:53.480 --> 3:20:59.040]  So Ridley Scott's Prometheus is literally based on the ideas of Watson, Crick, even
[3:20:59.040 --> 3:21:00.040]  Isaac Newton, right?
[3:21:00.040 --> 3:21:04.080]  Or they believed in the notion of panspermia that we were seeded here by some other planet
[3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:09.680]  or perhaps by intelligent Archon engineers, right?
[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:14.040]  And all of that is relevant because it doesn't matter so much whether it's true or false
[3:21:14.040 --> 3:21:15.280]  or to what degree it's true or false.
[3:21:15.280 --> 3:21:19.560]  I mean, I believe it is, but the point, it falls, but the point is that if they can get
[3:21:19.560 --> 3:21:25.440]  the majority of the population to believe this, then it can be used as a strategic social
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:30.560]  engineering tool to just further funnel people into the world government.
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:37.400]  The alien space religion has a very good chance of being used by the elite to be part of the
[3:21:37.400 --> 3:21:38.400]  global religion.
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:41.080]  The global government will need a global religion.
[3:21:41.080 --> 3:21:42.640]  The H.E. Wells even said that.
[3:21:42.640 --> 3:21:43.640]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:21:43.640 --> 3:21:44.640]  We'll be right back.
[3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:48.160]  This is the Alex Jones show and I'm Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:21:48.160 --> 3:21:53.160]  You know, listeners call into the cell where they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:58.880]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:02.040]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[3:22:02.040 --> 3:22:05.800]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products, please
[3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:07.360]  buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:22:07.360 --> 3:22:08.360]  But it's true.
[3:22:08.360 --> 3:22:12.120]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:16.400]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:17.400]  else.
[3:22:17.400 --> 3:22:21.040]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:23.920]  comes out and we open, our credibility is going up.
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:25.440]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:22:25.440 --> 3:22:27.560]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:31.040]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America is still quasi-free.
[3:22:31.040 --> 3:22:35.880]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air with all the craziness that's
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:36.880]  about to unfold.
[3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:39.160]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:22:39.160 --> 3:22:44.280]  So thank you all and get in the infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:22:44.280 --> 3:22:45.280]  and so much more.
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:46.920]  They're wonderful products and they support the info.
[3:22:46.920 --> 3:22:47.920]  We're thanking you.
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:54.000]  What are Champions made of.
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:57.280]  Here's a man who can show you.
[3:22:57.280 --> 3:22:59.280]  AAAAHHHHHH
[3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:01.160]  AAAAHHHHH
[3:23:01.380 --> 3:23:03.040]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:04.820]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:04.860 --> 3:23:06.160]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:06.260 --> 3:23:08.280]  is the infower-store hotline
[3:23:08.360 --> 3:23:09.340]  Truplate 253139
[3:23:09.380 --> 3:23:11.140]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:11.260 --> 3:23:12.760]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:12.880 --> 3:23:14.740]  is the infower-store hotline
[3:23:14.820 --> 3:23:16.220]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:16.340 --> 3:23:18.040]  is the infower-store hotline
[3:23:18.160 --> 3:23:19.480]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:19.580 --> 3:23:21.520]  is the infower-store hotline
[3:23:21.620 --> 3:23:22.800]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:22.940 --> 3:23:24.540]  is the infower-store hotline
[3:23:24.660 --> 3:23:26.160]  Truplate 2533139
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:23:59.600]  Chemical then dominated two major industries,
[3:23:59.600 --> 3:24:01.440]  plastics and drugs.
[3:24:01.440 --> 3:24:05.000]  Companies began synthesizing patented versions
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:07.040]  of naturally sourced drugs.
[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:09.880]  The natural sources were then made illegal.
[3:24:09.880 --> 3:24:12.680]  Pharmaceuticals became medicine.
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:15.880]  And the sicker people got, the more their industry grew.
[3:24:15.880 --> 3:24:19.600]  It's a death cult and it's up to the individual to escape.
[3:24:19.600 --> 3:24:22.840]  Good health begins with a healthy immune system,
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:25.720]  which needs the proper nutrients to thrive.
[3:24:25.720 --> 3:24:29.680]  Nutrients we cannot readily get from our food today.
[3:24:29.680 --> 3:24:33.040]  The combinations of vitamin C and zinc and vitamin D3
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:36.200]  with calcium have been proven to be what we need
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:39.040]  to maintain a healthy immune system.
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:41.760]  Go to infowarstore.com and start supporting
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:43.760]  your natural immune system now

[3:24:48.440 --> 3:24:50.360]  Gerald and South Carolina, go ahead,
[3:24:50.360 --> 3:24:51.560]  you're on the air, trying to move quicker.
[3:24:51.560 --> 3:24:52.800]  Hey Alex, welcome.
[3:24:52.800 --> 3:24:54.280]  Would like to say first off,
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:24:56.160]  thanks for being the voice of reason
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:24:57.960]  and amongst all this stupidity.
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:24:58.960]  Wanted to warn people,
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:00.760]  I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year.
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:02.760]  Okay, I'm a double amputee
[3:25:02.760 --> 3:25:06.360]  and I have bacteria infection on my lung
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:07.760]  that'll never go away.
[3:25:07.760 --> 3:25:09.440]  Living defense saved my life.
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:12.400]  They had me on antibiotics for two years
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:13.560]  that almost killed me.
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:15.280]  Living defense brought me back.
[3:25:15.280 --> 3:25:17.880]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible,
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:20.880]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:23.280]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[3:25:23.280 --> 3:25:26.960]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[3:25:26.960 --> 3:25:30.000]  and shall kill you and ye shall be hated
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:32.520]  of all nations for my name's sake.
[3:25:32.520 --> 3:25:34.760]  And then shall many be offended
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:38.120]  and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:39.720]  That's right where we're at brother.
[3:25:39.720 --> 3:25:42.360]  And that's because God's name is on the founding
[3:25:42.360 --> 3:25:44.160]  of this country, no matter what they say.
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:45.480]  And that's why the enemy hates it
[3:25:45.480 --> 3:25:47.480]  because God created this country.
[3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:52.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:26:00.040 --> 3:26:05.040]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:07.160]  I guess those did our analysis.
[3:26:07.160 --> 3:26:09.160]  We were caught off guard.
[3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:11.160]  We were caught off guard.
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:13.160]  We were caught off guard.
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:15.160]  We were caught off guard.
[3:26:15.160 --> 3:26:20.160]  We were covering the story of alien deception,
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:24.960]  propaganda, how it's being used.
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:27.000]  And an important thing to remember
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:29.600]  is that there were several key movies
[3:26:29.600 --> 3:26:32.160]  back in the 40s and 50s that came out.
[3:26:32.160 --> 3:26:34.080]  They really promoted this idea.
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:35.880]  One of the most famous of which of course
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:38.680]  was The Day the Earth Stood Still.
[3:26:38.680 --> 3:26:41.040]  And if you go back and watch that film,
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:44.240]  it's amazing the level of overt propaganda in that film.
[3:26:44.240 --> 3:26:46.800]  In fact, the Klaatu character, right?
[3:26:46.800 --> 3:26:48.280]  Everybody knows who this alien is.
[3:26:48.280 --> 3:26:50.080]  He comes and he threatens to destroy Earth
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:52.800]  because Earth is unevolved and the humans are violent
[3:26:52.800 --> 3:26:53.640]  or whatever.
[3:26:53.640 --> 3:26:57.040]  So the irony of course is he's going to kill everybody
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:26:57.880]  because humans are violent.
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:26:59.640]  Well, it's not an action of violence, right?
[3:26:59.640 --> 3:27:01.560]  So it's like it's kind of defeats the purpose
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:02.840]  of what he says he's here to do.
[3:27:02.840 --> 3:27:07.840]  But you'll notice that the motivations and justifications
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:11.560]  that the aliens often give in the movies
[3:27:11.560 --> 3:27:14.720]  just happens to coincide with the Malthusian attitude
[3:27:14.720 --> 3:27:16.920]  of the global elite, right?
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:20.680]  That, oh, we have to solve the problem of humanity
[3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:22.040]  by getting rid of humanity, right?
[3:27:22.040 --> 3:27:23.760]  If we become post-human,
[3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:26.440]  that will solve the problem of what it is to the human.
[3:27:26.440 --> 3:27:28.080]  We'll just get rid of the humans, right?
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:31.600]  And this character Klaatu was intentionally intended
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:35.120]  to be a replacement to Jesus' character, right?
[3:27:35.120 --> 3:27:38.280]  So the background to this is in 1949,
[3:27:38.280 --> 3:27:41.160]  there was a scientist named Dr. James Lipp
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:44.440]  and he wrote this report called Project Sine.
[3:27:44.440 --> 3:27:47.760]  And Project Sine went into what would be the plot
[3:27:47.760 --> 3:27:50.320]  of Day the Earth Stood Still.
[3:27:50.320 --> 3:27:52.800]  There's a famous figure involved in the production
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:54.280]  of the Day the Earth Stood Still,
[3:27:54.280 --> 3:27:58.680]  a famous CIA psychological warfare figure named CD Jackson.
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:27:59.840]  You may have heard of him.
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:03.320]  He's the guy behind the doctrinal warfare program
[3:28:03.320 --> 3:28:06.040]  where the CIA, as we know from the Wim Hofbeck book,
[3:28:06.040 --> 3:28:08.400]  attempted to co-opt and did successfully co-opt
[3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:11.720]  the Roman Catholic Church during the Cold War.
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:16.720]  Now, this project was intended to create a CIA or an OSS
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:21.000]  last CIA narrative that would be used to socially engineer
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:24.920]  the notion of science, progress, right?
[3:28:24.920 --> 3:28:27.560]  Denuclearization, all these kinds of ideas
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:30.280]  that were so-called progressive at the time.
[3:28:30.280 --> 3:28:31.800]  And another way we know this is the case
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:34.360]  is that the head of 20th Century Fox at that time,
[3:28:34.360 --> 3:28:36.600]  Darrell Zanuck, actually went to the office
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:39.480]  of wartime intelligence and told the ODI,
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:42.320]  you can have 20th Century Fox to do whatever you want
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:43.760]  in terms of propaganda.
[3:28:43.760 --> 3:28:46.160]  So again, all the way back in the 40s and 50s,
[3:28:46.160 --> 3:28:49.440]  the very beginning of the OSS and CIA,
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:52.880]  you had the immediate usage of Hollywood for propaganda.
[3:28:52.880 --> 3:28:55.800]  Now, of course, Hollywood was being used prior to that.
[3:28:55.800 --> 3:28:57.280]  But these are just great examples.
[3:28:57.280 --> 3:29:00.320]  And another key documentary I would recommend people see
[3:29:00.320 --> 3:29:02.520]  if they haven't seen it, it's called Mirage Men.
[3:29:02.520 --> 3:29:04.000]  Mirage Men, I think it's free on YouTube.
[3:29:04.000 --> 3:29:08.840]  It's just a investigation into how the alien UFO narrative
[3:29:08.840 --> 3:29:12.840]  was used in several instances of psychological warfare
[3:29:12.840 --> 3:29:14.400]  and disinformation.
[3:29:14.400 --> 3:29:16.880]  So again, I'm not claiming that it's all fake
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:18.800]  or that there's no unexplained phenomenon
[3:29:18.800 --> 3:29:20.920]  or that there's no spiritual component or dimension.
[3:29:20.920 --> 3:29:21.760]  I'm not saying that.
[3:29:21.760 --> 3:29:24.760]  I'm just saying that one important aspect or angle
[3:29:24.760 --> 3:29:28.080]  is the disinformation psychological warfare angle.
[3:29:28.080 --> 3:29:29.440]  And in fact, in that documentary,
[3:29:29.440 --> 3:29:32.760]  they interviewed multiple counterintelligence operatives,
[3:29:32.760 --> 3:29:35.080]  including Richard Doty, who talks about how, yes,
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:38.920]  we would just pick narcissistic kind of self-involved,
[3:29:38.920 --> 3:29:42.840]  self-important individuals who we would give this runaround
[3:29:42.840 --> 3:29:46.040]  that, oh, let's go meet General So-and-So at a base.
[3:29:46.040 --> 3:29:47.680]  He's got some important things to tell you.
[3:29:47.680 --> 3:29:49.480]  And General So-and-So brings them in
[3:29:49.480 --> 3:29:52.240]  and he pops a tape into the VCR and says,
[3:29:52.240 --> 3:29:55.400]  Son, we've chosen you to be the disinformation outlet
[3:29:55.400 --> 3:29:58.040]  for the dissemination of our covenant that we've made
[3:29:58.040 --> 3:29:59.000]  with the space beings.
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:00.680]  And by the way, here's this fuzzy,
[3:30:00.680 --> 3:30:04.520]  brand new VHS tape of the alien ship taken off
[3:30:04.520 --> 3:30:05.360]  at the airport's base.
[3:30:05.360 --> 3:30:08.160]  And all it was was literally a video created by a guy
[3:30:08.160 --> 3:30:11.680]  who made Star Trek next generation special effects.
[3:30:11.680 --> 3:30:14.840]  They interview all the people in the documentary.
[3:30:14.840 --> 3:30:19.440]  So this is a key thing to see through this obvious deception.
[3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:24.440]  Now, it's not just old, 60s, 50s, CIA narratives
[3:30:25.760 --> 3:30:27.800]  or science fiction narratives that promoted this.
[3:30:27.800 --> 3:30:30.560]  There was also Black Ops groups in the aviary.
[3:30:30.560 --> 3:30:34.760]  There was also Black operations that were done
[3:30:34.760 --> 3:30:39.040]  to use alien and cryptozoological narratives.
[3:30:39.040 --> 3:30:42.200]  I'm not joking, by the CIA to dupe people
[3:30:42.200 --> 3:30:43.080]  during the Cold War.
[3:30:43.080 --> 3:30:45.880]  There are famous cases of this in Latin and South America
[3:30:45.880 --> 3:30:49.600]  where they would actually use Marion apparitions,
[3:30:49.600 --> 3:30:52.160]  literally in Latin and South America to say,
[3:30:52.160 --> 3:30:55.280]  oh, look, Mary has appeared and she's telling everybody
[3:30:55.280 --> 3:30:59.840]  that you need to go fight in this XYZ warfare operation,
[3:30:59.840 --> 3:31:01.320]  this guerrilla operation, whatever.
[3:31:01.320 --> 3:31:04.000]  Don't listen to the opposition there of the devil
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:05.880]  and Mary says it, right?
[3:31:05.880 --> 3:31:09.080]  Again, we can begin to see how this might be
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:11.520]  the explanation for other events like this.
[3:31:11.520 --> 3:31:14.880]  In fact, even some Catholic analysts
[3:31:14.880 --> 3:31:17.600]  and traditional Catholic theologians have opined
[3:31:17.600 --> 3:31:21.440]  that the Megagory apparitions perhaps could fit
[3:31:21.440 --> 3:31:25.000]  into this Cold War narrative of Mary suddenly appearing
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:28.440]  and giving the messages that just happened
[3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:32.320]  to back up the CIA's narrative in the Cold War.
[3:31:32.320 --> 3:31:34.480]  I'm not saying that that makes the Soviets good, right?
[3:31:34.480 --> 3:31:36.280]  So both sides of the Cold War engaged
[3:31:36.280 --> 3:31:38.320]  in these kinds of deceptions.
[3:31:38.320 --> 3:31:40.840]  It's including the Soviets, including the West.
[3:31:40.840 --> 3:31:42.080]  But I'm just saying that we have
[3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:44.400]  its specific documented instances.
[3:31:44.400 --> 3:31:46.960]  In fact, Victor Marchetti in his book,
[3:31:46.960 --> 3:31:48.680]  believe it's CIA and Cult of Intelligence,
[3:31:48.680 --> 3:31:49.920]  or it's one of his books.
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:52.840]  He talks about them using in the Philippines
[3:31:52.840 --> 3:31:55.440]  the mythology of a local vampire myth, right?
[3:31:55.440 --> 3:31:58.800]  And basically staging vampire events, right?
[3:31:58.800 --> 3:32:01.800]  To utilize the psychology of fear
[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:04.640]  during some CIA black operation.
[3:32:04.640 --> 3:32:06.760]  So we have documented instances
[3:32:06.760 --> 3:32:08.880]  of different intelligence operations
[3:32:08.880 --> 3:32:10.240]  and networks using cults.
[3:32:10.240 --> 3:32:12.160]  In fact, let's not forget one
[3:32:12.160 --> 3:32:14.320]  of the greatest examples, Alistair Crowley himself.
[3:32:14.320 --> 3:32:17.760]  Crowley was an agent, an asset for MI5.
[3:32:17.760 --> 3:32:20.000]  This has been well documented in the book,
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:22.920]  Secret Agent 666 by Dr. Richard Spence.
[3:32:22.920 --> 3:32:26.320]  And we know that Crowley was being used to send messages
[3:32:26.320 --> 3:32:27.840]  out to different people who respected
[3:32:27.840 --> 3:32:31.200]  his esoteric so-called analysis
[3:32:31.200 --> 3:32:32.960]  to basically bait people
[3:32:32.960 --> 3:32:34.720]  like Rudolph has to fly into Scotland.
[3:32:34.720 --> 3:32:37.320]  That was actually a British intelligence operation.
[3:32:41.680 --> 3:32:44.480]  Ian Fleming was involved in sort of being part
[3:32:44.480 --> 3:32:46.720]  of that operation to get has to fly into Scotland.
[3:32:46.720 --> 3:32:47.840]  That was a British intelligence.
[3:32:47.840 --> 3:32:49.560]  And so they used Crowley to do this, right?
[3:32:49.560 --> 3:32:51.840]  Well, Crowley also is one of the founders
[3:32:51.840 --> 3:32:53.480]  of the modern alien mythos
[3:32:53.480 --> 3:32:55.280]  because he claimed that the entities
[3:32:55.280 --> 3:32:58.080]  that he was interacting with and channeling
[3:32:58.080 --> 3:33:02.400]  and all this stuff were beings that he drew pictures of,
[3:33:02.400 --> 3:33:03.560]  one of which is called lamb.
[3:33:03.560 --> 3:33:05.440]  And lamb just happens to look exactly
[3:33:05.440 --> 3:33:07.560]  like the modern grays, right?
[3:33:07.560 --> 3:33:09.800]  He looks just like the description of an alien.
[3:33:09.800 --> 3:33:12.920]  And in fact, today, people who follow the Crowley
[3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:17.640]  and route of his satanic invocations,
[3:33:17.640 --> 3:33:18.840]  they will actually say,
[3:33:18.840 --> 3:33:20.960]  we're doing nothing else than interacting
[3:33:20.960 --> 3:33:23.000]  with interdimensional entities
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:24.880]  or what other people call aliens.
[3:33:24.880 --> 3:33:26.480]  In fact, people from Hollywood
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:29.080]  who claimed to have been involved in Crowley Colt
[3:33:29.080 --> 3:33:30.760]  will say, yeah, we're just talking to the aliens.
[3:33:30.760 --> 3:33:33.840]  Yeah, there you go, there's lamb, right?
[3:33:33.840 --> 3:33:35.600]  The aliens are the same things
[3:33:35.600 --> 3:33:38.040]  that we're invoking in our ceremonial rituals
[3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:41.440]  in our trance states or when we're doing high doses of LSD
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:43.160]  or when we're doing DMT or whatever,
[3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:44.840]  it's the same entities.
[3:33:44.840 --> 3:33:46.280]  And why is it that the entities
[3:33:46.280 --> 3:33:47.680]  always have the same message?
[3:33:47.680 --> 3:33:50.040]  Again, they always tell people,
[3:33:50.040 --> 3:33:52.360]  bro, just set up a global government dude
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:54.080]  and everybody would be happy
[3:33:54.080 --> 3:33:57.720]  and everybody could just be watching Pornhub all day
[3:33:57.720 --> 3:33:58.960]  and we could all could just be like
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:00.760]  Coomers in space or whatever,
[3:34:00.760 --> 3:34:02.480]  it'll be awesome or whatever, right?
[3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:05.440]  That's the narrative that all of the aliens
[3:34:05.440 --> 3:34:07.200]  and the DMT clockwork else tell everybody
[3:34:07.200 --> 3:34:10.000]  that goes into those dimensions
[3:34:10.000 --> 3:34:11.080]  and it's not accidental.
[3:34:11.080 --> 3:34:13.480]  So that's the demonic component to this, right?
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:16.720]  And then there's the deep state dark component to this,
[3:34:16.720 --> 3:34:17.840]  the black ops component,
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:20.800]  which no better example than the figure of,
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:24.400]  who was by the way, a devotee of Crowley, Michael Aquino.
[3:34:24.400 --> 3:34:27.680]  Colonel Michael Aquino was instrumental
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:29.960]  in formulating the modern army's
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:31.720]  psychological warfare doctrine.
[3:34:31.720 --> 3:34:34.920]  He wrote a famous essay, I think it's Mine War to Cy War.
[3:34:34.920 --> 3:34:36.120]  And at the end of that document,
[3:34:36.120 --> 3:34:38.640]  he says that we're gonna have to geo engineer,
[3:34:38.640 --> 3:34:40.120]  we're gonna have to change the atmosphere.
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:43.200]  He says, human cells operate like antennae.
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:45.440]  We're gonna have to mutate man, right?
[3:34:45.440 --> 3:34:48.520]  And basically blast him with different frequencies.
[3:34:48.520 --> 3:34:52.480]  This is in the footnotes of his famous army document.
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:54.120]  And then thereby we can mutate man.
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:34:55.480]  Now, who was Michael Aquino?
[3:34:55.480 --> 3:34:57.480]  Well, he's not just a famous satanist,
[3:34:57.480 --> 3:35:00.840]  he also started a satanic cult called the Temple of Set.
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:05.280]  He studied under Levet for a while
[3:35:05.280 --> 3:35:06.600]  and was a devotee of Crowley
[3:35:06.600 --> 3:35:09.080]  before going on to start his own cult.
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:12.280]  But he was also one of the key researchers
[3:35:12.280 --> 3:35:14.480]  at Spacecom for many years.
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:17.560]  And then he went on to do deep intense research
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:21.360]  in MK Ultra and MK Naomi, MK Search.
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:24.600]  So Michael Aquino, who studied the UFO phenomenon
[3:35:24.600 --> 3:35:27.200]  at Spacecom, who studies MK Ultra,
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:29.160]  who then writes the armies,
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:32.080]  part of the army's psychological warfare doctrine, right?
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:34.600]  Is it any surprise that we see so many parallels
[3:35:34.600 --> 3:35:36.680]  to the UFO phenomenon
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:39.320]  and the satanic ritual abuse phenomenon, right?
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:41.240]  And the mind control MK Ultra phenomenon.
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:43.440]  They're all connected because it's the same people
[3:35:43.440 --> 3:35:45.240]  who run these scams.
[3:35:45.240 --> 3:35:47.480]  So J. Dyer, Jason Alsis, we'll be back in a moment.
[3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:49.880]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:52.480]  the first ever Kava Kava root supplement
[3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:55.960]  that is now available at infowarstore.com.
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:58.320]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:00.280]  in the natural health world today,
[3:36:00.280 --> 3:36:02.360]  though it has been used for hundreds of years
[3:36:02.360 --> 3:36:04.840]  in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:06.440]  and euphoric effects.
[3:36:06.440 --> 3:36:08.360]  According to ancient Samoan legend,
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:12.200]  Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[3:36:12.200 --> 3:36:14.680]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:16.480]  and creator of the universe.
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:18.400]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea
[3:36:18.400 --> 3:36:21.200]  during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies
[3:36:21.200 --> 3:36:22.400]  to loosen up a little.
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:24.680]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world
[3:36:24.680 --> 3:36:27.280]  by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:29.840]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals
[3:36:29.840 --> 3:36:32.920]  contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:35.880]  but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[3:36:35.880 --> 3:36:39.960]  German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian root.
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:42.680]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly,
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:36:47.680]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[3:36:47.680 --> 3:36:49.160]  I don't like coming to you
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:51.480]  and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:52.960]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years,
[3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:55.240]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:36:55.240 --> 3:36:56.880]  But let me tell you, the new world orders
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:36:58.480]  breathe them down our neck.
[3:36:58.480 --> 3:37:00.800]  The big globalist publications are coming after us,
[3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:02.840]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:05.680]  So please pray to keep info wars on the air,
[3:37:05.680 --> 3:37:07.120]  and please support the local states
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:08.600]  you're listening to as well.

[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:19.280]  because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:20.760]  in the face of this thing.
[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:22.880]  I need your help more than ever now.
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:24.360]  I wanna keep fighting the globalists,
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:27.080]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:37:27.080 --> 3:37:29.560]  So pray for us, word of mouth,
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:31.880]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can,
[3:37:31.880 --> 3:37:34.200]  and buy great products that will enrich you

[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:10.640]  Crumple action as
[3:40:10.640 --> 3:40:14.220] ...
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:17.720]  We're getting into the parallels and similarities
[3:40:17.720 --> 3:40:21.400]  between the people who undergo different versions
[3:40:21.400 --> 3:40:22.720]  of ritual abuse.
[3:40:22.720 --> 3:40:33.520]  the accounts that we have of people who underwent various studies in the MK-Ultra panorama was
[3:40:33.520 --> 3:40:39.280]  actually a whole bunch of different studies. And then the military research into psychological
[3:40:39.280 --> 3:40:44.480]  warfare and alien engineering. So let's remember that there's many other alien cults, right,
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:50.720]  that we can point to. Scientology. Remember that L. Ron Hubbard came out of the Cronlian system of
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:55.360]  gradations and hierarchy. And once he graduated Crowley's system, he went to go, he went on to
[3:40:55.360 --> 3:41:00.720]  create his own cult, right, which was Scientology. And Scientology has an elaborate space opera
[3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:06.480]  mythology as well, right? You were seated by aliens and you got to clear your body of all the alien,
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:11.760]  you know, leftovers or whatever. And this is part of their whole auditing mind control process.
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:18.000]  So these are all basically stamped out in a lab, right? The model of the alien cult is pretty much
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:22.400]  always the same. And there's others as well. The Order of the Solar Temple is another Crowleyan
[3:41:22.400 --> 3:41:27.920]  sort of alien type of Gnostic cult. They all bear those similar patterns and stamps. And I think
[3:41:27.920 --> 3:41:33.120]  that a lot of them, maybe not every one of them, but many of them were kind of part of waste study
[3:41:33.120 --> 3:41:38.880]  manipulation. And what use would this kind of a religion be? Well, we've seen the Vatican actually
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:44.320]  in the last few years come out and kind of hint at admitting the possibility that, oh, maybe there
[3:41:44.320 --> 3:41:50.000]  are alien lives out there. Maybe when the aliens show up, we'll have to baptize aliens. Maybe they
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:55.280]  can be saved too. Oh, maybe we should just, you know, revise all of our religions and, oh, maybe
[3:41:55.280 --> 3:42:00.000]  all the world religions were more or less kind of just teaching us this alien myth, right? So they
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:06.320]  all have fragments of the truth. And then the real religion is the overall, right, alien mythos,
[3:42:06.320 --> 3:42:11.120]  the superstructure religion or something like that. Now, I think there's a good chance that they could
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:15.840]  play that card. I think what they do is that the elite is that they will actually float different
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:23.040]  ideas and articles and see the response and wait and see if the public has basically been engineered
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:29.120]  to a point where they believe in or are susceptible to the accepting of the alien mythos. So they're
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:34.560]  probably not at that level yet, even though studies do show a growing percentile of people that do
[3:42:34.560 --> 3:42:39.920]  accept the alien origins myth. And this is why we have the new atheists, basically, right? Richard
[3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:43.920]  Dawkins, people like this coming out. I believe that alien life is definitely possible. We were
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:49.840]  seen by aliens. That's probably likely very much true, maybe, probably, right? And that's more
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:54.640]  reasonable somehow than God. I don't know why that would be more reasonable than God. But
[3:42:55.200 --> 3:43:01.120]  behind all of this, of course, is the manipulation and planning of the deep state. And that's why
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:07.040]  clouds can come out and say, there will be the discovery of alien life the next several years
[3:43:07.040 --> 3:43:12.960]  who are then having no private property. The aliens just happen to magically want what the
[3:43:12.960 --> 3:43:18.240]  very economic forum wants. The aliens just happen to want you to take a microchip.
[3:43:18.240 --> 3:43:23.520]  Right. So it just happens to be the case, right? How is it that Klaus is always so right, right?
[3:43:23.520 --> 3:43:29.200]  I mean, he just happens to know, right, that there's going to be something like the coof
[3:43:29.200 --> 3:43:35.040]  coming. He just happens to know that cyber polygon, right? There will be all of these attacks
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:40.400]  on the infrastructure from a cyber vantage point. He just happens to know that there's going to be
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:49.120]  alien disclosure. Or do these people know because they're in on planning it? What's more rational?
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:52.960]  What's more likely in that scenario? Well, obviously, that they're part of planning it.
[3:43:52.960 --> 3:43:59.600]  Duh. It's a no-brainer. And so how does this fit into this narrative? What's the point of this?
[3:43:59.600 --> 3:44:06.480]  Well, remember that the guiding strategy that they continually reuse and just recycle,
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:11.760]  rinse, repeat, is problem reaction solution. We've all heard this. But what does that mean?
[3:44:11.760 --> 3:44:21.200]  Well, it just means controlled chaos, right? It means managing chaos, right? And steering the
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:26.720]  chaos in the way that the elite want it to go. And that could involve them actually starting
[3:44:26.720 --> 3:44:32.400]  the chaos in the case of false flags or it might be a situation where something organically happens
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:39.360]  and then they co-opt and steer it, right? On a smaller scale, right, you could look at co-intel
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:45.760]  operations or black ops where you have like a McVeigh type of situation or a grip that's co-opted
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:51.120]  and steered by informants and honey pots and all that. That's a smaller scale version of,
[3:44:51.120 --> 3:44:56.000]  right, controlled and managed chaos, right, where they come in and solve and save the day
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:01.440]  or whatever the feds and whatnot. Well, this is a bigger scale of that where we go back to
[3:45:01.440 --> 3:45:07.360]  the 50s, 60s, and 70s. And the alien narrative, the alien myth was humans are the problem. We've
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:13.760]  got a global crisis. There's no way to fix this without a global solution. Remember the famous
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:20.000]  Reagan speech at the United Nations, I think back in the 80s, right, was if we just had a global
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:27.520]  government or if we just had a global crisis, right, and he says perhaps a space-based crisis of
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:34.320]  aliens, perhaps an alien extra planetary threat could bring the world together under a global
[3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:39.520]  United Nations government to look up the famous Reagan speech at the UN where he says that alien
[3:45:39.520 --> 3:45:44.000]  life could serve that purpose. So we know that's one of the carbs, right, like the Illuminati
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:51.680]  Kardek that could be played. The alien disclosure discovery narrative could be played. In my view,
[3:45:51.680 --> 3:45:56.720]  perhaps that's why they set SETI up. You know what SETI is, right? It was popular in all these
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:46:02.560]  80s and 90s, you know, sci-fi movies. Go watch Contact and Michael, you know, you got Matthew
[3:46:02.560 --> 3:46:07.040]  McConaughey's out there at SETI, right? He's just trying to hit on, get him a little piece of Jodie
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:13.280]  Foster while Jodie Foster's sending emails to the aliens from SETI, right? So Matthew McConaughey's
[3:46:13.280 --> 3:46:18.160]  in all these SETI movies, right? What was SETI? Well, SETI was just part of the propaganda to
[3:46:18.160 --> 3:46:23.920]  let us think, right, that, you know, that Werner von Braun, of course, talked about this. So this
[3:46:23.920 --> 3:46:31.280]  has been in the cards for a long time. And SETI could, oh, we got a message. SETI got an email,
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:36.480]  right? E.T. sent SETI an email. What does it say? Oh, it says we're coming. And this potentially,
[3:46:36.480 --> 3:46:41.200]  right, could be where Blue Bean comes into play here, perhaps some advanced version of
[3:46:41.200 --> 3:46:46.240]  holographic imagery. We've seen a lot of videos going around viral for many years of, you know,
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:52.400]  pretty elaborate holograms, right, that people could be duped into thinking was a Jesus, a Buddha,
[3:46:52.400 --> 3:46:57.840]  you know, whatever, a religious imagery as a second coming or something like that. And again,
[3:46:57.840 --> 3:47:02.720]  that's not out of the realm of possibility, given what we did see in these previous instances that
[3:47:02.720 --> 3:47:08.560]  I listed of the CIA using religious imagery and mythology to dupe people during the Cold War
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:16.400]  and even in the present day. Apparitions are a great way to dupe people to, to serve a function
[3:47:16.400 --> 3:47:20.880]  stacking, right? A magical apparition, right? Yeah, there we have. So SETI is going to find some
[3:47:20.880 --> 3:47:26.720]  code, right? Remember in close encounters, right? All the nerds are sitting there at SETI or a CIA
[3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:30.160]  base or whatever NSA or something. And they're, oh, look, we got the coordinates of where the
[3:47:30.160 --> 3:47:36.240]  aliens are going to land and it has to be over here by the Denver Airport, right? Well, no,
[3:47:36.240 --> 3:47:43.200]  this is all really just stage managed, it's stage planned. It's not a real alien disclosure. It's
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:47.680]  should be patently obvious because by the way, if you want a template that they'll probably use,
[3:47:47.680 --> 3:47:53.760]  have you read Childe's End? Childe's End is the template for this very thing.
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:48:01.600]  And again, Arthur C. Clarke, he didn't just write that, he wrote 2001, 2010. By the way,
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:08.160]  2010 is just as important for 2000, for the narrative as 2001, because in 2010,
[3:48:08.160 --> 3:48:15.920]  the aliens are revealed to be these basically advanced AI beings, right, that shepherd mankind
[3:48:15.920 --> 3:48:22.000]  into their evolutionary ascent to deity. There you go. Everybody should watch, right? The,
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:28.560]  if you can't read it, go watch the sci-fi channels version of Childe's End because it's the same
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:33.040]  pattern. Arthur C. Clarke, by the way, was hanging out in the circles of Alistair Crowley,
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:38.480]  so you can look at Karellen, right, the demon figure there, who literally looks like a demon.
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:43.600]  I don't know how much more obvious could it be? Oh, he's got cloven hooves. I wonder what this is
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:49.680]  supposed to be. I wonder, right? And what does he do? He comes and he offers everybody global
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:56.320]  government. He offers medical miracles. He offers a solution to the wars and the famines and the
[3:48:56.320 --> 3:49:03.760]  pestilences, right? The alien salvation narrative, which is a Gnostic mythological narrative.
[3:49:03.760 --> 3:49:09.280]  But do you know how spoiler alert Childe's End ends? Well, he does the same thing that
[3:49:09.280 --> 3:49:14.880]  Star Child does in the original story of 2001. Oh, sorry, but in order to save you,
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:20.000]  we're going to have to take your generation of children on our spaceship and we're going to
[3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:24.960]  have to nuke the rest of you. So Earth gets nuked, just like in 2001, Earth is supposed to be nuked.
[3:49:24.960 --> 3:49:32.560]  A demon comes to save humanity, to nuke Earth, to save us. Again, the aliens are always doing what
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:37.600]  the global elite are doing. Why are the aliens always Malthusian? It just happens to be the case
[3:49:37.600 --> 3:49:41.440]  that the aliens are, you know, Malthusian. It just happens to be the case that they're all,
[3:49:41.440 --> 3:49:45.520]  it just happens to be the case that they're demons and that they say the same things demons say,
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:49.840]  right? Oh, kill everybody for us and we'll give you a utopia, right? Wink, wink. I mean, it's so
[3:49:49.840 --> 3:49:56.560]  obviously baloney. It's so obviously propaganda and it's so obviously demonic. And so that's how
[3:49:56.560 --> 3:50:03.440]  this narrative, this fake story fits into the mythos of the Great Reset is that it's exactly
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:09.760]  the religious pattern of the things that Klaus and the global elite push. Mankind is the problem.
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:15.680]  Man has to be put to death because he is a resource vampire. He's sucking up all the resources.
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:21.680]  He's, you know, harming the planet through climate, right? Through his exhalations of
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:25.280]  carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide is a toxin. None of which is true, by the way.
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:33.280]  And so it's all fake. It's fake and gray. I thought I was going to say something else.
[3:50:33.280 --> 3:50:46.400]  No, it's fake and gray, aka gray.
