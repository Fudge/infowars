[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.572]  Teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game.
[00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:06.996]  And above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:07.857]  Get control.
[00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:08.657]  Get relief.
[00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:09.698]  Get some sleep.

[00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:32.399]  It's four o'clock.
[00:00:39.718 --> 00:00:43.102]  USA Radio Network News, Richard Curtis reporting.
[00:00:43.102 --> 00:00:47.748]  The administration has issued a statement about the latest round of bombings in Baghdad.
[00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.913]  USA Radio Network White House correspondent Connie Lawn reports from Washington.
[00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:57.340]  The White House press secretary says another atrocity in Baghdad has targeted the innocent people of Iraq.
[00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:07.689]  Free nations of the world must not stand by while terrorists commit mass murder in an attempt to derail democratic progress in Iraq and throughout the greater Middle East.
[00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.732]  The press secretary says the United States stands with the people of Iraq.
[00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:24.102]  He says we will support the freely elected Iraqi government and its security forces to help bring those responsible for the atrocities to justice and to deliver greater security to the people of Baghdad.
[00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:26.984]  Connie Lawn, USA Radio Network News, The White House.
[00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:32.387]  Dangerously cold weather is moving across the northern plains and Midwest states.
[00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:37.271]  Morning lows expected to be in the 5 to 10 below zero range across the upper Midwest.
[00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:41.756]  Even more frigid temperatures are forecast from northern Minnesota to Montana.
[00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:45.059]  Add to that a wind chill and it's very dangerous weather.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.647]  President Bush has signed a disaster declaration for four Florida counties that were devastated by the tornadoes that struck early Friday morning.
[00:01:53.647 --> 00:02:00.734]  20 people are dead and at least 1,500 homes were either destroyed or significantly damaged by the storms.
[00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:04.097]  You're listening to USA Radio Network News.
[00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.817]  It's work demanding so much of your time that it's beginning to hurt your family and relationships?
[00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:21.310]  How would you like to earn between $500 to $7,000 or more a month working from home with a company that supports your success with ongoing training and marketing?
[00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:32.761]  HomeBiz7.com would like to give you a free work-at-home information package and DVD that will show you how you could earn a full-time income by starting with just a few hours a week.
[00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:35.023]  The first month in the business was actually pretty exciting.
[00:02:35.023 --> 00:02:38.667]  I actually made about $1,200 my very first month in the business.
[00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:41.049]  Obviously now it's well over ten times that.
[00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:41.890]  Incredible market.
[00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.710]  I think so.
[00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:14.346]  California Senator Barbara Boxer has visited the UN as a Democratic delegate from the Senate to the General Assembly.
[00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:18.909]  She says she has a message for Sudan's leadership about Darfur.
[00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:34.020]  The world is watching you, and the United States Congress is watching you, and it's time to accept the deployment of a UN-led mission to stop the humanitarian suffering and to improve the security situation on the ground in Darfur.
[00:03:34.642 --> 00:03:40.744]  He's planning to resign later this year, but most Britons want Prime Minister Tony Blair to step down now.
[00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:49.327]  A new ICM poll published today in London's Sunday Express newspaper shows 56% of respondents want the embattled leader to resign now.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.405]  And the bodies of two Virginia teens missing for two weeks have been found.
[00:03:54.405 --> 00:04:02.896]  The bodies of 16-year-old Rachel Smith and 18-year-old Rachel Kreitz were found in the front seats of a car belonging to the Kreitz family near the West Virginia border.
[00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:05.359]  It's believed the girls committed suicide.
[00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:06.020]  USA News.
[00:04:07.555 --> 00:04:14.099]  When the IRS put a lien on my house, garnished my wages, and levied my bank account, my attorney referred me to Associated Tax Relief.
[00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.840]  Calling them was the best move I ever made.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.181]  They got us a settlement we can live with.
[00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:19.683]  Do you owe the IRS $10,000 or more?
[00:04:19.683 --> 00:04:21.684]  Associated Tax Relief can help you.
[00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:27.567]  Associated Tax Relief has helped taxpayers settle their tax debt with the IRS for mere pennies on the dollar.

[00:04:37.882 --> 00:04:43.526]  A new movement is afoot to have the Monday following the Super Bowl be a federal holiday.
[00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:48.370]  One of the leaders of this grassroots effort, Robert Chute, tells USA Radio Network why.
[00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:57.217]  We found that Super Bowl Monday morning, especially here on the East Coast, is not a productive morning.
[00:04:57.217 --> 00:05:02.241]  So we're proposing that we take the day off after the Super Bowl.
[00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.152]  The Super Bowl brings with it supersized parties and overeating.
[00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:17.879]  That's the assessment of dietician Elizabeth Pinniman, who says many people overindulge in high-calorie foods and drinks while watching the big game.
[00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:24.242]  She recommends not hanging around the food table and practicing moderation to avoid overeating.
[00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:26.324]  There's more news on usaradio.com.
[00:05:26.324 --> 00:05:30.246]  Richard Curtis reporting, USA Radio Network News.
[00:05:35.615 --> 00:05:39.956]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:05:39.956 --> 00:05:41.976]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:05:41.976 --> 00:05:48.558]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:05:48.558 --> 00:05:54.920]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Ripe discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.780]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.481]  I think so.
[00:06:11.937 --> 00:06:15.520]  All step-by-step instructions, using pictures, are easy to follow.

[00:06:23.645 --> 00:06:23.705]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:41.221]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:44.002]  Scrap the soul set and hold on.

[00:06:49.963 --> 00:06:52.424]  He stands for what's right.

[00:07:04.116 --> 00:07:13.500]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.541]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:18.122]  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:07:18.122 --> 00:07:21.884]  Yes, I'm live and I'm here in studio.
[00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:27.747]  We're going to be here for the next two hours, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:39.012]  Central Standard Time, coming to you live from the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLVJ, and now syndicated across the country for the last three months, gaining several affiliates each week.
[00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:42.114]  We're very excited about that.
[00:07:42.114 --> 00:07:44.995]  I'm always chomping at the bit to get on air.
[00:07:44.995 --> 00:07:50.998]  You know, I do a weekday show, Money Through Friday syndicated, been doing that now for, well syndicated for nine years, been on the air for 12.
[00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:59.396]  But I'm glad I have a Sunday show because in the past I would be really upset on Saturday or Sunday with news that came out over the weekend.
[00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:01.059]  I'd be wanting to get on air.
[00:08:01.059 --> 00:08:02.201]  Now I can do that.
[00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:05.880]  And today, I am literally fit to be tied.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:19.507]  I've got friends and family calling me, which they normally don't do, saying, man, I hope you give them hell on this new issue, and that's forcing you to take a live cancer virus vaccine.
[00:08:19.507 --> 00:08:21.348]  And yes, we'll be talking about that today.
[00:08:21.348 --> 00:08:22.969]  It's happening all over the country.
[00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.510]  But as usual, I'm very embarrassed of this.
[00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.391]  Texas is leading the way into darkness.
[00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:28.712]  And tyranny.
[00:08:28.712 --> 00:08:30.433]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:08:30.433 --> 00:08:33.094]  Perry requires HIV vaccine for girls.
[00:08:33.094 --> 00:08:34.055]  That's a fraud.
[00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.276]  That's a hoax.
[00:08:35.276 --> 00:08:38.217]  We'll break that down as well as the vaccine itself.
[00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:43.400]  There's a lot of different facets to this that we'll be going over.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:54.147]  Also, big new developments concerning a Freedom of Information Act request, FOIA request with the North American Union and how that ties into the global warming hoax.
[00:08:55.163 --> 00:09:03.427]  I'm not debating climate change, but what we're being told about global warming and the solutions we're being given are nothing more than a global tax and a hoax.
[00:09:03.427 --> 00:09:05.788]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:09:05.788 --> 00:09:18.214]  Also, the Swiss may expand assisted suicide law to the mentally ill, and if you read carefully, the state will decide whether you're to die or not, and the state will kill you.
[00:09:18.214 --> 00:09:21.856]  So we'll be breaking that down for you and having open phones.
[00:09:23.383 --> 00:09:28.829]  Also, in the second hour, I have John Connor, syndicated radio host, joining me.
[00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:29.930]  He's on the Genesis Network.
[00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.172]  I'm on weekdays.
[00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:37.078]  This Sunday show is syndicated via MS Communications in association with Genesis.
[00:09:37.078 --> 00:09:43.125]  And he also, before we ever got a syndicated talk show, engages in guerrilla call-ins to talk radio.
[00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:49.925]  And he called into our own Rush Limbaugh and brought up the occult activities of the global elite, i.e.
[00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:53.688]  Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, and what happened was quite interesting.
[00:09:53.688 --> 00:09:55.690]  Of course, I was brought up in the conversation.
[00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:01.815]  We'll play a few minutes of that in the second hour and break it down, because truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:02.756]  But let me do this.
[00:10:02.756 --> 00:10:08.562]  I'm not very good at this, because I'm always so focused on the news, but in the last two weeks,
[00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:11.404]  And I asked my producer to put down all the stations.
[00:10:11.404 --> 00:10:13.825]  It's not his fault, but, well, it is his fault.
[00:10:13.825 --> 00:10:14.586]  I'm not mad at him.
[00:10:14.586 --> 00:10:15.686]  He does a good job.
[00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:19.549]  Two stations are missing here, but that's okay.
[00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:24.772]  Five new stations in the last week and a half that have signed on to this new Sunday show.
[00:10:24.772 --> 00:10:26.473]  I want to thank them.
[00:10:26.473 --> 00:10:30.996]  WRSB, 1310 AM, out of upstate New York.
[00:10:30.996 --> 00:10:32.257]  I guess up by Niagara.
[00:10:33.152 --> 00:10:37.273]  On the Sunshine Network, WCGA, 1100 AM, St.
[00:10:37.273 --> 00:10:40.254]  Simons Island, Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:41.895]  Covers four major cities.
[00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:43.695]  Cox Broadcasting Group.
[00:10:43.695 --> 00:10:47.997]  And of course, WTAR, 850 AM, Norfolk, Virginia.
[00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:51.378]  A gigantic blowtorch going into multiple states.
[00:10:51.378 --> 00:10:54.039]  That, of course, is Sinclair slash MS Communications.
[00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:56.019]  Very thankful for that affiliate.
[00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:58.800]  WASB, 1590 AM.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.361]  And that's out of Rochester, New York.
[00:11:01.981 --> 00:11:08.584]  And WCER, Canton, Cleveland, Ohio, 900 a.m.
[00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:14.246]  And I know that Albuquerque has already signed on when they're going to be carrying it next few weeks.
[00:11:14.246 --> 00:11:18.168]  For several months I've told you about good old Salt Lake City with Ktalk.
[00:11:18.168 --> 00:11:19.308]  They've signed on.
[00:11:19.308 --> 00:11:21.849]  And two other stations that aren't here on the list.
[00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:24.670]  So a lot of affiliates signing on.
[00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.251]  The show's only three months old.
[00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:29.012]  I'm very, very excited and honored to be here.
[00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:31.393]  So I do want to thank all those affiliates that we're listing on the internet.
[00:11:31.773 --> 00:11:34.616]  We'll be taking calls throughout this hour and the second hour.
[00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:35.717]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-595-525-877-590-KLBJ.
[00:11:59.108 --> 00:12:02.730]  Station we're broadcasting out of, and of course locally in Central Texas.
[00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.072]  Another way for you to call 836-0590.
[00:12:06.072 --> 00:12:07.793]  Again, we are live.
[00:12:07.793 --> 00:12:14.437]  It is Super Bowl Sunday, and we're here burning the Super Bowl Sunday oil to get this information out to you.
[00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:16.158]  All right!
[00:12:16.158 --> 00:12:21.461]  You know I talk a lot about vaccines, and we've detailed, I put it in my films.
[00:12:21.461 --> 00:12:27.305]  It is on the record that the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and other eugenic-type bodies
[00:12:28.072 --> 00:12:37.898]  ...set up by people who push the Nazi ideals, have been caught adding hormones to tetanus shots to sterilize women from Africa to Asia to Latin America.
[00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:43.882]  We know that vaccines haven't taken out the mercury, the thethamerosol.
[00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:50.987]  They've actually increased it five-fold at the Associated Press to several hundred times at the safe level.
[00:12:50.987 --> 00:12:52.468]  They're also filled with aluminum.
[00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:59.036]  And just a few decades ago, there were only five or six vaccines they tried to claim were mandatory.
[00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:00.156]  That was a fraud itself.
[00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:02.657]  We'll break that down in a moment.
[00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:05.959]  And then, going back a few years ago, it was 25 vaccines.
[00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:16.663]  Currently, it's 27 to 38, depending on the state, under different federal mandates and lobbying by the big pharmaceutical companies.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.862]  Well, the latest outrage is now upon us, and there are hundreds of new vaccines a year.
[00:13:23.862 --> 00:13:33.105]  They're all, their main business is lobbying government to attempt to intimidate you, to try to set the precedent to make you take this and put this into your body.
[00:13:33.105 --> 00:13:45.348]  In fact, here in front of me, and for those watching on TV land, also, we're on television here on Channel 10 in Austin for the radio show, let me just show you the news article here out of the Statesman yesterday.
[00:13:45.348 --> 00:13:46.449]  Today is the 4th.
[00:13:46.449 --> 00:13:47.189]  This was Saturday
[00:13:47.589 --> 00:13:53.731]  February 3rd, Perry requires HI vaccine for girls.
[00:13:53.731 --> 00:14:02.854]  But then, hallelujah, they have to tell the truth in the next breath with a sub-headline, Parents Can Opt Out of Project Targeting Cancer-Causing Virus.
[00:14:03.672 --> 00:14:08.276]  Let me go through some more of the headlines before I detail this and break it down for you.
[00:14:08.276 --> 00:14:12.419]  And this did get my blood pressure up Friday when Perry signed this executive order.
[00:14:12.419 --> 00:14:14.741]  The ultra-liberal posing as a conservative.
[00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:17.843]  The gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting piece of filth.
[00:14:17.843 --> 00:14:24.909]  He wants to hand our roads over and has handed them over to a foreign Spanish company to tax us for the North American Union funding.
[00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:27.511]  Source, federal government, SPP.gov.
[00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:32.095]  Texas governor issues executive order requiring anti-cancer vaccine for schoolgirls.
[00:14:33.502 --> 00:14:36.205]  Here's another chilling story out of the Washington Times.
[00:14:36.205 --> 00:14:38.667]  Vaccine Center issues warning.
[00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:43.252]  It's killing and maiming people en masse.
[00:14:43.252 --> 00:14:44.493]  Another AP article.
[00:14:44.493 --> 00:14:47.295]  Texas requires cancer vaccine for girls.
[00:14:47.295 --> 00:14:54.623]  And it says, quote, it wasn't immediately clear how long the order would last and whether the legislation was still necessary.
[00:14:54.623 --> 00:14:56.925]  It's not a law, it's a fraud!
[00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:01.687]  Well, we've got a dumbed-down population.
[00:15:01.687 --> 00:15:07.076]  I need to call Liz Austin Peterson from the AP up and explain to her federal and state law.
[00:15:07.076 --> 00:15:11.964]  Let me just do that right now before I have a stroke here on air.
[00:15:11.964 --> 00:15:13.887]  Number one, for two months,
[00:15:14.537 --> 00:15:33.934]  In every newspaper, every major radio station, every news TV station, and nationally, in the two months leading up, you've all seen it countless times, for the last decade, as school begins to start, they say, it's the law, you've got to get all your shots, all your immunizations, all your vaccines, or you will be suspended!
[00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:35.235]  And there will be criminal charges!
[00:15:36.744 --> 00:15:40.105]  There are no criminal charges.
[00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.685]  There is no law.
[00:15:41.685 --> 00:15:43.386]  But they play a trick.
[00:15:43.386 --> 00:15:46.647]  A racketeering extortion.
[00:15:46.647 --> 00:15:49.347]  Go look up those definitions.
[00:15:49.347 --> 00:15:50.488]  Look it up online.
[00:15:50.488 --> 00:15:51.528]  Google it.
[00:15:51.528 --> 00:15:55.969]  They engage in racketeering and extortion and fraud.
[00:15:55.969 --> 00:15:59.450]  And they tell you that there is a law.
[00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.851]  We'll explain the fraud when we get back.
[00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:02.351]  And get in.
[00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:08.076]  To the CDC's own warning not to take it.
[00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:09.937]  Will that stop Rick Perry?
[00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:11.318]  The answer is hell no.
[00:16:11.318 --> 00:16:14.760]  He's bought and paid for, as the AP reports, by Merck.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.661]  The same folks that brought you Bios.
[00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:18.141]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:19.022]  Stay with me.
[00:16:19.022 --> 00:16:20.462]  InfoWars.com.
[00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:21.563]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:16:26.847 --> 00:16:36.955]  It's here!
[00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:42.100]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:49.746]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:57.879]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:16:57.879 --> 00:17:09.607]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:17:09.607 --> 00:17:13.590]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.832]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:17:15.832 --> 00:17:19.675]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:17:28.064 --> 00:17:29.225]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:29.565]  February 2, 2007.
[00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:32.946]  Gold 655 ounce gold coins are 676.36, 340.73 per half, 170.37 per quarter ounce.
[00:17:32.946 --> 00:17:33.206]  That's 676.36, 340.73 and 170.37.
[00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.211]  Could government let this happen?
[00:17:49.211 --> 00:17:51.332]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:18:16.889 --> 00:18:24.012]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:18:24.012 --> 00:18:25.812]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:18:25.812 --> 00:18:27.133]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:27.313]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:18:33.582 --> 00:18:39.609]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:18:39.609 --> 00:18:46.377]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:49.561]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:50.321]  We're good to go.

[00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:42.591]  We've gone from 1 in 25,000 having autism 20 years ago.
[00:20:50.254 --> 00:20:59.196]  Now, 22 years ago, the statistics got older, to 1 in 168, and the new numbers coming out are less than 1 in 80.
[00:20:59.196 --> 00:21:04.497]  Whole schools filled with autistic children from the mercury, conclusive.
[00:21:04.497 --> 00:21:19.481]  Then the media lies, the PR firms lie, all financed with billions of dollars out of the 200 plus billion dollar a year industry globally, just with vaccines alone, to tell you, oh, we took it out, but you go research, even mainstream news in the back of the paper,
[00:21:20.106 --> 00:21:20.988]  That's a term I use.
[00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:22.150]  I mean, it's buried.
[00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.654]  Admits they've actually increased the amount of mercury.
[00:21:24.654 --> 00:21:28.661]  But all that aside, let's just say you think vaccines are wonderful for you.
[00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:33.810]  We're going to go through the CDC and the federal government's own admissions of how dangerous this new Merck vaccine is.
[00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.653]  Even if you think it's great, why is the media lying to you?
[00:21:38.653 --> 00:21:42.557]  Why is the government lying and saying it's the law?
[00:21:42.557 --> 00:21:44.278]  Listen to this deceptive headline.
[00:21:44.278 --> 00:21:48.182]  But normally they wouldn't have the sub-headline that basically retracts it.
[00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:51.605]  Harry requires HPV vaccine for girls.
[00:21:51.605 --> 00:21:55.889]  Parents can opt out of project targeting cancer-causing virus.
[00:21:58.118 --> 00:22:02.039]  There is no law that you have to take any vaccine in this country.
[00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:02.620]  Nowhere.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.981]  In the 50 states, in the protectorates, in the District of Columbia, they've tried and lobbied.
[00:22:07.981 --> 00:22:10.902]  Here in the U.S., it has not worked.
[00:22:10.902 --> 00:22:19.285]  So, the legislature was saying that they weren't even going to make it on the list of recommended, now approaching 40+, and growing.
[00:22:20.459 --> 00:22:32.675]  And so Rick Perry says, well, I don't care if the people are upset about this, and both parties are saying no, despite the fact that Merck has spent more money on this in Texas than, and by the way, every other state, than any other vaccine they've pushed.
[00:22:32.675 --> 00:22:37.741]  I'm going to sign an executive order, and then he engaged in the hoax of saying you've got to take it.
[00:22:38.394 --> 00:22:42.475]  And people will go into the school, the schools will lie and say, you've got to take it to be in school.
[00:22:42.475 --> 00:22:46.396]  They'll never tell you there's a waiver in their drawer by federal and state law they're supposed to give you.
[00:22:46.396 --> 00:22:49.237]  And by the way, it's been to the courts, you don't have to sign that waiver.
[00:22:49.237 --> 00:22:52.478]  They just ask you to, to give the illusion that you have to.
[00:22:52.478 --> 00:22:55.619]  So, it is a mass hoax.
[00:22:55.619 --> 00:22:59.660]  Now, let's talk about what this vaccine does.
[00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.661]  Here is the Washington Times.
[00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:06.956]  Vaccine Center issues warning.
[00:23:06.956 --> 00:23:09.325]  This came out Saturday, yesterday.
[00:23:11.187 --> 00:23:22.756]  The National Vaccine Information Center yesterday warned state officials to investigate the safety of a breakthrough cancer vaccine as Texas became the first state to make the vaccine mandatory for school-age girls.
[00:23:22.756 --> 00:23:23.277]  It's not.
[00:23:23.277 --> 00:23:24.698]  Again, the hoax again.
[00:23:24.698 --> 00:23:35.946]  Negative side effects of the new vaccine, a new Merck vaccine to prevent the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer, are being reported in the District of Columbia and 20 states including Virginia.
[00:23:35.946 --> 00:23:38.849]  The reactions range from loss of consciousness
[00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:40.289]  To seizures.
[00:23:40.289 --> 00:23:40.869]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:43.550]  Remember shaking babies started 15 years ago?
[00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.290]  They later had to remove that.
[00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.651]  And all the cop cars with the bumper stickers, don't shake a baby.
[00:23:47.651 --> 00:23:50.271]  I wonder if all these babies were dying, having seizures.
[00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:52.912]  They'd arrest the parents when they'd come in.
[00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:54.412]  And they did studies on this.
[00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:58.713]  It was within hours or days they'd go into seizures from all the mercury.
[00:23:58.713 --> 00:24:03.034]  Because it's four to five times, depending on the shot, overdose for an adult.
[00:24:03.034 --> 00:24:04.114]  And the average adult weighs 150 pounds.
[00:24:05.652 --> 00:24:14.119]  Can you imagine a 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 pound baby in about the third round when they weigh 20 pounds when they're 18 months, a year and a half old?
[00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:19.984]  So they go ahead and CPS you and grab your kids after they did the damage to your child.
[00:24:19.984 --> 00:24:26.950]  Quote, young girls are experiencing severe headaches, this is from the CDC by the way, are experiencing severe headaches
[00:24:28.064 --> 00:24:38.793]  Dizziness, temporary loss of vision, and some girls have lost consciousness during what appear to be seizures, said Vicki Debold, health policy analyst for the National Vaccine Information Center.
[00:24:38.793 --> 00:24:40.115]  And it just goes on.
[00:24:40.115 --> 00:24:52.785]  And Friday, I interviewed the head of the Texas Eagle Forum, their national chair on international studies, and she's interviewing the people where the little girls take it and start bleeding out of their noses, out of every orifice.
[00:24:52.785 --> 00:24:54.647]  People are dying.
[00:24:54.647 --> 00:24:55.448]  By the way,
[00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:59.355]  Do you know what this is?
[00:24:59.355 --> 00:25:03.417]  This is not some irradiated or microwaved virus or bacterium.
[00:25:03.417 --> 00:25:07.559]  This is a live cancer virus.
[00:25:07.559 --> 00:25:15.824]  And they breed billions of these in each vaccine trough that they grow off of human fetal tissues.
[00:25:15.824 --> 00:25:18.765]  They have another procedure where they use eggs.
[00:25:18.765 --> 00:25:23.848]  And when they breed all of this stuff up in human tissue, they attempt
[00:25:24.722 --> 00:25:32.295]  To breed a virus that has had its chain cut in half so it doesn't have the full complement to cause the cancer.
[00:25:32.947 --> 00:25:38.568]  But of course you're getting wild mutations, wild aberrant problems, and I've got all the medical reports here.
[00:25:38.568 --> 00:25:41.749]  I mean, I've literally got 20-something articles today.
[00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:43.390]  I can't cover them all here.
[00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.210]  That's my frustration and why I talk 90 miles an hour.
[00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.971]  Just Google it.
[00:25:47.971 --> 00:25:50.591]  New Merck cancer vaccine has live virus.
[00:25:50.591 --> 00:25:51.351]  Just type it in.
[00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:53.032]  Hundreds of articles.
[00:25:53.032 --> 00:25:54.312]  You've probably already read it in your paper.
[00:25:54.312 --> 00:25:55.432]  It's all over the news.
[00:25:55.432 --> 00:25:56.433]  It's a big story.
[00:25:56.433 --> 00:26:01.654]  And I think the government and Rick Perry and others, no matter where you live, they're lobbying nationwide, have gone too far.
[00:26:02.498 --> 00:26:08.001]  Because parents didn't even know about the waiver, the conscientious objector or religious objection.
[00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:10.202]  They're still buying the fraud, you've got to take these.
[00:26:10.202 --> 00:26:20.908]  Now people are finding out about this, and everybody I know, even people in my family and neighbors who don't believe me on a lot of issues, are knocking on my door going, hey man, you were right about this.
[00:26:20.908 --> 00:26:28.713]  I got a cousin in New York, and they gave it to the daughter, and now she's in the hospital.
[00:26:28.713 --> 00:26:31.054]  I mean, I know people this is happening to.
[00:26:32.603 --> 00:26:34.125]  And they're so arrogant.
[00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:35.346]  It's the same thing.
[00:26:35.346 --> 00:26:40.011]  97% in the Houston Chronicle poll don't want toll roads on existing roads run by a Spanish company.
[00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:41.493]  Rick Perry says, I don't care what you want.
[00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:45.297]  91% in Gallup polls don't want open borders.
[00:26:45.297 --> 00:26:49.081]  Bush and the Democrats together say, we don't care, blanket amnesty, guest worker program.
[00:26:50.387 --> 00:26:54.271]  70 plus percent of the troops, 78 percent of Americans don't want the Iraq War.
[00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:56.933]  They say, we don't care what you want, we're gonna increase troops.
[00:26:56.933 --> 00:27:01.736]  And by the way, it's not 21,500, it's 50,000 troops in the surge.
[00:27:01.736 --> 00:27:05.479]  And even Oliver Norris says that'll get more of them killed, putting them in undefended locations.
[00:27:05.479 --> 00:27:06.020]  So what?
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.163]  They're gonna die!
[00:27:10.163 --> 00:27:16.188]  I mean, not only is it illegal and constitutional racketeering, the people don't want it, and they still do it.
[00:27:17.296 --> 00:27:18.417]  So I'm hopping mad.
[00:27:18.417 --> 00:27:25.140]  Not only is this vaccine dangerous, not only... And by the way, the CDC, folks, would approve cyanide in your Kool-Aid.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:32.203]  I mean, they would approve jumping off a cliff is good for you if they got campaign contributions to the politicians that appoint the people that run the CDC.
[00:27:32.203 --> 00:27:35.724]  So for them to come out and say, hey, you don't take it!
[00:27:35.724 --> 00:27:38.526]  No, it's not even completely vetted and approved yet!
[00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:39.926]  What's going on in Texas?
[00:27:39.926 --> 00:27:40.827]  Hold off!
[00:27:40.827 --> 00:27:43.348]  It's a live virus!
[00:27:43.348 --> 00:27:46.029]  Even the CDC's talking like Alex Jones!
[00:27:48.732 --> 00:27:59.356]  I mean, this is serious business, but they know, they know, they're going to make over $10 billion a year, if even a fraction, that's on the news, of the schoolgirls take this.
[00:27:59.356 --> 00:28:02.757]  And they know full well most of you aren't that involved in children's lives.
[00:28:02.757 --> 00:28:04.038]  You just believe whatever you're told.
[00:28:04.038 --> 00:28:09.720]  You're going to let them line up, starting in the 6th grade, they're recommending and even down to the 5th grade.
[00:28:10.618 --> 00:28:14.979]  And taking an experimental live cancer virus vaccine.
[00:28:14.979 --> 00:28:20.720]  How many times have you heard me in the last 12 years on air tell you they put cancer viruses in the vaccines?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.481]  I read university studies from the 20s and 30s where the Rockefeller family funded the Nazi eugenicist.
[00:28:26.481 --> 00:28:27.861]  I'm making a film about it right now.
[00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:29.201]  I'm one of the leading experts on this.
[00:28:29.201 --> 00:28:30.782]  I've been doing years of research on this.
[00:28:30.782 --> 00:28:33.222]  I'm making a film about this.
[00:28:33.222 --> 00:28:37.163]  And that they studied how to put live cancer virus in stasis
[00:28:37.928 --> 00:28:43.898]  Inside the vaccines and then the Rockefellers covertly own many of the big cancer research facilities and make the money.
[00:28:43.898 --> 00:28:46.041]  They get most of the money out of you before you die.
[00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:47.764]  It's big business.
[00:28:47.764 --> 00:28:49.607]  You are insane!
[00:28:50.488 --> 00:28:53.672]  If you take any vaccines.
[00:28:53.672 --> 00:28:55.234]  I'm not saying they couldn't help.
[00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:56.915]  I'm not saying it's not a real science.
[00:28:56.915 --> 00:28:58.497]  I'm not saying it couldn't do some good.
[00:28:58.497 --> 00:29:02.281]  You can't trust this government that gave black men syphilis in Tuskegee.
[00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:10.110]  You can't trust a government that radiated tens of thousands of children domestically over 110,000 internationally.
[00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.732]  Just type in ringworm children into Google.
[00:29:12.646 --> 00:29:23.660]  You can't trust people under Project Shad that radiated and toxified and poisoned and biological attacked our troops in thousands of illegal studies.
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.263]  If you... We'll be right back, folks.
[00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.231]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:29:36.231 --> 00:29:38.531]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:29:38.531 --> 00:29:41.492]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:29:41.492 --> 00:29:45.973]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:29:45.973 --> 00:29:46.574]  Here's why.
[00:29:46.574 --> 00:29:53.495]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:29:53.495 --> 00:29:59.297]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:29:59.437 --> 00:30:00.118]  But they're not.
[00:30:00.118 --> 00:30:04.081]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:30:04.081 --> 00:30:08.765]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:15.932]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:19.076]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!
[00:30:19.076 --> 00:30:20.117]  Go to www.OutAnd90.com.
[00:30:20.117 --> 00:30:21.159]  That's www.OutAnd90.com.
[00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:21.860]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.080]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.305]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:30:38.305 --> 00:30:41.568]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:30:41.568 --> 00:30:44.491]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:30:44.491 --> 00:30:49.696]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:30:49.696 --> 00:30:55.361]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:30:55.361 --> 00:30:58.324]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:30:58.504 --> 00:31:01.165]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[00:31:01.165 --> 00:31:10.510]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast, because of the restrictive measures included, which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:17.133]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the Beast, take notice.
[00:31:17.133 --> 00:31:19.034]  It says, Worship the Beast.
[00:31:19.034 --> 00:31:21.635]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[00:31:21.895 --> 00:31:27.145]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:27.145 --> 00:31:27.466]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:36.230]  Is your child disrespectful, defiant, or obnoxious?
[00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.731]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?
[00:31:38.731 --> 00:31:40.672]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman.
[00:31:40.672 --> 00:31:45.315]  I'll help you turn your child's behavior around right now with the Total Transformation.
[00:31:45.315 --> 00:31:50.598]  After the Total Transformation, there's no more arguing, no more lecturing, no more backtalking.
[00:31:50.598 --> 00:31:52.499]  Now when I ask him to do something, he does it.
[00:31:52.879 --> 00:31:58.321]  We've learned verbiage from the Total Transformation Program, and it's almost like magic.
[00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:00.842]  If you say those words, they stop arguing.
[00:32:00.842 --> 00:32:06.344]  Defiance, backtalking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[00:32:06.344 --> 00:32:10.246]  The Total Transformation will help you solve even the worst behavior problems.
[00:32:10.246 --> 00:32:15.148]  I guarantee your child will listen to you again, and you'll get peace and sanity back in your home.
[00:32:15.148 --> 00:32:19.370]  Call now and get how to turn your child's attitude around in one minute or less, free with your order.
[00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.410]  Call 1-800-373-0402.
[00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.424]  Shelly, you look ex... Oh, wait!
[00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:35.524]  Why did you turn that down?
[00:32:35.524 --> 00:32:38.605]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:32:38.605 --> 00:32:43.267]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:32:43.267 --> 00:32:45.968]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:32:45.968 --> 00:32:47.269]  I could use something like that.
[00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:49.730]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.671]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:54.591]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:57.232]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:32:57.232 --> 00:32:58.233]  I guess you're right.
[00:32:58.233 --> 00:32:59.093]  Why don't we try it?
[00:32:59.093 --> 00:33:01.054]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:33:01.474 --> 00:33:06.176]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:33:06.176 --> 00:33:07.937]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:33:07.937 --> 00:33:12.540]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.061]  The bed fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[00:33:16.061 --> 00:33:17.642]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:20.663]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[00:33:20.663 --> 00:33:22.124]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[00:33:22.124 --> 00:33:23.685]  The Bedfan is the answer.
[00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:27.306]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[00:33:27.306 --> 00:33:30.167]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[00:33:30.167 --> 00:33:35.229]  That's bedfan.com.
[00:33:35.229 --> 00:33:37.850]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.991]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:33:46.568 --> 00:33:48.490]  Raging for the truth.
[00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.551]  Exposing corruption.
[00:33:50.551 --> 00:33:54.214]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[00:33:54.214 --> 00:33:58.537]  He's Alex Jones.
[00:33:58.537 --> 00:34:03.401]  So, Rick Perry, in the Associated Press reports, has got massive contributions.
[00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:06.884]  Members of his staff are Merck employees.
[00:34:06.884 --> 00:34:11.968]  The legislature says, we're not going to try to pass a law just recommending the vaccine.
[00:34:11.968 --> 00:34:16.031]  Then they pose and claim that it's mandatory when it's not, so that's fraud one.
[00:34:17.583 --> 00:34:25.187]  Rick Perry comes out and says, I don't care if it's experimental, I don't care if it's having all these bad reactions, we've got to save our children.
[00:34:25.187 --> 00:34:35.473]  Ladies and gentlemen, there were only 9,710 cases of cervical cancer, and that's a very rare form of cancer out of 300 million Americans.
[00:34:35.473 --> 00:34:40.116]  There are millions and millions of cases each year of lung cancer, liver cancer.
[00:34:40.116 --> 00:34:40.796]  No, 9,710 cases
[00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.512]  Only a couple hundred people die per state.
[00:34:47.512 --> 00:34:49.534]  Virginia, it was 210.
[00:34:49.534 --> 00:34:50.794]  The bigger states, California, 527.
[00:34:50.794 --> 00:34:51.295]  Texas was 400.
[00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:53.756]  And they want to... Oh, by the way, the shot is over $360.
[00:35:04.063 --> 00:35:14.067]  $360 for a live cancer virus vaccine that's causing incredible health problems in a large percentage.
[00:35:14.067 --> 00:35:16.608]  That's immediately of those that take it.
[00:35:16.608 --> 00:35:18.068]  Seizures, you name it.
[00:35:18.068 --> 00:35:20.169]  I want to ask you out there who have daughters.
[00:35:21.315 --> 00:35:31.060]  I have a daughter, and I've said over my dead body, hell, Hades itself will freeze over before my daughter ever takes something like this.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:31.781]  And they're not going to stop.
[00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:39.785]  Hundreds of new vaccines a year, constant lobbying to try to make you take this, and then imply to the PR groups that you have to take it.
[00:35:39.785 --> 00:35:41.926]  All of that should make you mad.
[00:35:41.926 --> 00:35:43.207]  Any one of those points
[00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:47.411]  Should have you seeing red.
[00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:47.471]  877-590-5525.
[00:35:47.471 --> 00:35:57.099]  The number again is 877-590-5525 or locally in Central Texas where we broadcast to you from 836-0590.
[00:35:57.099 --> 00:36:00.282]  I'm asking you, will you put up with this?
[00:36:00.282 --> 00:36:01.583]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:02.724]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:02.724 --> 00:36:04.966]  Read all the articles we've got posted.
[00:36:04.966 --> 00:36:08.289]  Where they admit that Merck is just lobbying and buying politicians.
[00:36:08.289 --> 00:36:09.691]  The same folks that brought you Vioxx.
[00:36:10.569 --> 00:36:14.130]  I mean, they always say don't take a drug that's been on the market five years.
[00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:22.512]  This thing has just been semi-approved for experimental use, and Rick Perry's saying every girl's gotta take it when you don't have to take it!
[00:36:22.512 --> 00:36:27.454]  The governor doesn't have the power to say, I give an executive order, you must take a vaccine!
[00:36:27.454 --> 00:36:29.774]  But they put out that hoax!
[00:36:29.774 --> 00:36:36.016]  And then you read deeper, and the AP says, well, no one knows if it really is the law, he just says it.
[00:36:36.016 --> 00:36:37.516]  No, it's not the law!
[00:36:37.516 --> 00:36:38.697]  It's your body!
[00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:39.837]  It's your children's body!
[00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:46.701]  So I am getting extremely, extremely angry about this.
[00:36:46.701 --> 00:36:53.824]  Here's a story from just a few days ago before Perry signed this executive order because the legislature was saying, no way, Jose.
[00:36:53.824 --> 00:36:56.085]  Drug firm pushes vaccine mandate.
[00:36:56.085 --> 00:37:00.827]  Merck lobbies Maryland on HPV preventative.
[00:37:00.827 --> 00:37:02.988]  And again, a live virus
[00:37:03.712 --> 00:37:18.644]  That only, on average, extremely sexually promiscuous women can even get this, and then it's a live virus, and it only infects 9,710 people, and kills a fraction of them each and every year.
[00:37:18.644 --> 00:37:23.108]  And simple pep smears can fix that problem, and it's easily treatable.
[00:37:24.073 --> 00:37:28.174]  By the way, about four years ago, I went completely ape on air.
[00:37:28.174 --> 00:37:30.755]  More than I'm getting angry today about this.
[00:37:30.755 --> 00:37:44.240]  And that was when England tried to pass a law making it mandatory to take a live virus vaccine that attacked the brain and created plaques.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.680]  You're saying, excuse me?
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.841]  Go look it up.
[00:37:46.841 --> 00:37:48.581]  You cannot make this kind of stuff up.
[00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:52.983]  It is so crazy to have a governor saying he's emperor.
[00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:57.442]  Lying and saying you've got to take something when it's experimental and causing all these problems.
[00:37:57.442 --> 00:38:08.470]  The British government had also reported, it was all over the news at the time, in the medical papers, medical publications, that they were claiming that you had to take this but then it failed because people refused.
[00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:09.951]  That is a shot!
[00:38:09.951 --> 00:38:10.872]  Remember hearing about it?
[00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:12.013]  You're going, I don't remember.
[00:38:12.013 --> 00:38:13.554]  You'll remember now.
[00:38:13.554 --> 00:38:19.178]  New vaccine to cure nicotine addiction.
[00:38:19.178 --> 00:38:20.459]  Smoking.
[00:38:20.459 --> 00:38:22.781]  New vaccine to cure cocaine and heroin use.
[00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:45.461]  Because the same neuroreceptors in the electrochemical operations of the human brain, you have natural endorphins when your team makes a touchdown, or you make a touchdown, or you make a big sale in business, or you get to date with a woman that you're in love with, you got a crush on, your body naturally rewards you.
[00:38:45.461 --> 00:38:47.482]  That's the natural high I'm on right now.
[00:38:47.482 --> 00:38:49.222]  No drugs needed.
[00:38:49.222 --> 00:38:51.523]  Most successful people have an overabundance of endorphins.
[00:38:53.138 --> 00:39:03.231]  They want to, and they've created a vaccine that has a live virus that attacks specific, I mean polio is a virus that attacks nerves.
[00:39:03.231 --> 00:39:09.258]  This is a virus similar, in fact it is a, it is a altered polio virus.
[00:39:09.258 --> 00:39:11.961]  Ladies and, again, you're not watching the Sci-Fi Channel.
[00:39:11.961 --> 00:39:12.562]  This is happening.
[00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:22.234]  That attacks the electrochemical neurons, the receptors, because the same receptors take in all of the opiates.
[00:39:22.234 --> 00:39:25.395]  And nicotine is in the same class, but doesn't have an opiate effect.
[00:39:25.395 --> 00:39:27.516]  Nicotine, heroin, cocaine.
[00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:29.957]  And it said, oh, it'll be great, it'll end drug abuse.
[00:39:29.957 --> 00:39:34.799]  It'll also cause viruses to eat microscopic holes in your brain.
[00:39:34.799 --> 00:39:42.462]  And then they said, well, there is a side effect where you won't be as happy and won't be able to feel your endorphins as much, but don't worry, we'll give you antidepressants!
[00:39:43.371 --> 00:39:43.951]  Oh yes!
[00:39:43.951 --> 00:39:50.533]  They give you a virus that literally gives you a selected lobotomy.
[00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:51.774]  And this is the same thing.
[00:39:51.774 --> 00:39:59.296]  This is a live virus causing major health problems, seizures, death, autoimmune responses.
[00:39:59.296 --> 00:40:01.717]  Next week I'm interviewing a bunch of people this is happening to.
[00:40:01.717 --> 00:40:05.639]  People are dying right now because of this.
[00:40:05.639 --> 00:40:06.779]  Alright, I'm going to take some calls.
[00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.893]  On this subject and others, and then we'll get into the North American Union, and just a lot more coming up.
[00:40:12.893 --> 00:40:17.755]  Swiss government wants to be able to kill people without even asking them with a suicide law.
[00:40:17.755 --> 00:40:19.116]  That's the state killing you.
[00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.897]  That's AP.
[00:40:20.897 --> 00:40:21.478]  Excuse me.
[00:40:21.478 --> 00:40:22.118]  Yeah, that is AP.
[00:40:22.118 --> 00:40:24.119]  I know we're here on Reuters.
[00:40:24.119 --> 00:40:35.265]  Let's go ahead and... You know, I had a caller here on the screen that wanted to talk about the vaccines, and I guess they're gone now.
[00:40:35.265 --> 00:40:35.526]  So...
[00:40:37.816 --> 00:40:40.618]  So it is on Line 5?
[00:40:40.618 --> 00:40:42.038]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:40:42.038 --> 00:40:42.839]  I'm confused.
[00:40:42.839 --> 00:40:44.840]  New phone system here.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:50.803]  Let's go ahead and talk to Melody in Ohio.
[00:40:50.803 --> 00:40:53.785]  You're on the air, thanks for holding.
[00:40:53.785 --> 00:40:57.547]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:40:57.547 --> 00:40:59.828]  I punched the button and it doesn't work.
[00:40:59.828 --> 00:41:01.629]  Will you air Line
[00:41:04.071 --> 00:41:06.092]  Okay, let's now go ahead and take another call.
[00:41:06.092 --> 00:41:10.175]  When it rains, it pours, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:10.175 --> 00:41:13.537]  Let's go ahead and talk to James.
[00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:14.578]  James, you're on the air.
[00:41:14.578 --> 00:41:15.959]  Welcome.
[00:41:15.959 --> 00:41:18.300]  Are you a Christian?
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.541]  Yes, I am a Christian.
[00:41:19.541 --> 00:41:23.664]  Okay, I was going to comment about your behavior and your entourages all year round.
[00:41:23.664 --> 00:41:24.884]  I think you've got a bit of an ego.
[00:41:26.724 --> 00:41:30.767]  You know, we're supposed to be humble, and it seems like you have an entourage calling you everywhere you go.
[00:41:30.767 --> 00:41:32.648]  I don't seem to call you on that.
[00:41:32.648 --> 00:41:39.853]  Okay, well, you know, I saw that your comment here was your entourage and behavior, and so... No, you've got a tremendous ego complex.
[00:41:39.853 --> 00:41:43.615]  You're not displaying any humility at all here, brother.
[00:41:43.615 --> 00:41:45.997]  No, I mean, I'm serious.
[00:41:45.997 --> 00:41:47.618]  Well, let's go back here.
[00:41:47.618 --> 00:41:50.720]  Well, let me just... You can babble and do whatever you want.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.922]  Believe me, I'm not... I mean, I've got plenty of telephone poles in my own eyes, but...
[00:41:54.355 --> 00:42:00.257]  I mean, I'm calling you on it because you've got a whole bunch of kids and young people following you, and I mean, you're setting a really terrible example.
[00:42:00.257 --> 00:42:00.617]  Okay, I know.
[00:42:00.617 --> 00:42:01.757]  You've said that four times now.
[00:42:01.757 --> 00:42:02.838]  Can I just say something?
[00:42:02.838 --> 00:42:03.798]  Sure, go for it.
[00:42:03.798 --> 00:42:04.698]  Okay.
[00:42:04.698 --> 00:42:05.718]  I'm here.
[00:42:05.718 --> 00:42:07.879]  I'm an energetic, aggressive person.
[00:42:07.879 --> 00:42:14.261]  Anyone who knows me knows that I'm actually very humble and nice and sharing and compassionate, but separate that.
[00:42:14.261 --> 00:42:20.203]  Let's say I'm the worst SOB in the galaxy, and Alex Jones is Beelzebub, okay?
[00:42:20.923 --> 00:42:22.205]  Are you going to talk?
[00:42:22.205 --> 00:42:28.132]  Can you focus on the issue of a live cancer virus they want to try to force our girls to take?
[00:42:28.132 --> 00:42:31.957]  Okay, can you talk about a real issue instead of focusing on the messenger?
[00:42:31.957 --> 00:42:36.302]  No, I mean, actually, I want to do... We need more research on this, obviously.
[00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:44.340]  More research, Rick Perry's trying to claim there's a law when there isn't, trying to claim you've got to take it when you don't, and the thing's experimental and deadly.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:49.524]  Right, but this particular virus is very serious and you've got to... No, it's not!
[00:42:49.524 --> 00:42:51.205]  No, it's not very serious.
[00:42:51.205 --> 00:43:02.213]  Out of 300 million people, 300 million people to have 9,710 cases a year, and a fraction of those dying is not very serious.
[00:43:02.213 --> 00:43:04.135]  The CDC says don't take it!
[00:43:05.023 --> 00:43:08.127]  But you've got a problem with me because you're a phony neocon.
[00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.929]  Guaranteed.
[00:43:09.929 --> 00:43:11.311]  Okay?
[00:43:11.311 --> 00:43:15.876]  Don't, you know, don't misunderstand my earnest and my passion for arrogance.
[00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:18.700]  Just some of us haven't been drinking the fluoride Kool-Aid, brother.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.081]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[00:43:20.081 --> 00:43:20.522]  Stay with me.
[00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.213]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.515]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:41.477]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:43:41.477 --> 00:43:45.961]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:43:45.961 --> 00:43:46.561]  Here's why.
[00:43:46.561 --> 00:43:53.167]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:43:53.467 --> 00:44:00.096]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:04.041]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:08.267]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:44:08.727 --> 00:44:12.929]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game.
[00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:16.370]  And above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.210]  Get control.
[00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.011]  Get relief.
[00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:19.051]  Get some sleep.
[00:44:19.051 --> 00:44:20.091]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:21.132]  That's www.outand90.com.
[00:44:21.132 --> 00:44:21.832]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:44:21.832 --> 00:44:22.052]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:36.178]  Pinch me, Bill.
[00:44:36.178 --> 00:44:37.558]  I can't believe it.
[00:44:37.558 --> 00:44:40.720]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.261]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[00:44:43.261 --> 00:44:45.462]  I know what you mean, John.
[00:44:45.462 --> 00:44:50.185]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[00:44:50.185 --> 00:44:54.067]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:44:54.067 --> 00:44:56.108]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[00:44:56.108 --> 00:45:01.310]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:02.371]  And I owe it all to you.
[00:45:02.951 --> 00:45:06.333]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:45:06.333 --> 00:45:09.415]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:10.956]  I want to tell everybody.
[00:45:10.956 --> 00:45:14.698]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[00:45:14.698 --> 00:45:16.640]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.401]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[00:45:19.401 --> 00:45:25.885]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[00:45:25.885 --> 00:45:26.706]  What a concept!
[00:45:33.792 --> 00:45:35.676]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:45:35.676 --> 00:45:36.938]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:45:36.938 --> 00:45:40.364]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:45:40.364 --> 00:45:43.089]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:45:43.653 --> 00:45:50.937]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:47:45.856 --> 00:47:49.659]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:54.784]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:54.784 --> 00:47:57.266]  Alright, I'm going to go back to your calls.
[00:47:57.266 --> 00:47:58.707]  We've got a guest coming up in the next hour.
[00:47:58.707 --> 00:48:00.869]  We'll also open phones then.
[00:48:00.869 --> 00:48:03.271]  I don't know even what to say.
[00:48:03.271 --> 00:48:05.693]  Trey, who runs the show during the break, said, did you hear him?
[00:48:05.693 --> 00:48:10.818]  He said, your cameras, your entourage, like I have paid videographers,
[00:48:12.282 --> 00:48:15.166]  Because I just like to have cameras videotaping me.
[00:48:15.166 --> 00:48:20.292]  It sounds like he went to UT Thursday night.
[00:48:20.292 --> 00:48:22.295]  The UT Union Ballroom.
[00:48:22.295 --> 00:48:24.918]  900 seats totally filled.
[00:48:24.918 --> 00:48:26.360]  Over 100 people turned away.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.163]  I went there and spoke for free.
[00:48:29.163 --> 00:48:30.205]  They invited me down there.
[00:48:30.205 --> 00:48:30.986]  A student group did.
[00:48:32.358 --> 00:48:38.059]  And I went down there and spoke, and I had video cameras there, sir, because we're in an information war.
[00:48:38.059 --> 00:48:48.502]  Believe me, I wasn't there paying people $15 an hour, in some cases more, to videotape me to then just have cameras so I look powerful.
[00:48:48.502 --> 00:48:53.903]  It was there so we put it on the web, like my film Terror Storm that's been number one on Google Video.
[00:48:53.903 --> 00:48:56.444]  See, I make documentaries, sir.
[00:48:56.444 --> 00:48:58.944]  I've made films that have aired on national U.S.
[00:48:58.944 --> 00:49:00.405]  and British television.
[00:49:00.405 --> 00:49:01.825]  That's why I have cameras.
[00:49:04.204 --> 00:49:12.049]  And you take it as arrogance that I have a staff, that I now have 12 employees.
[00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:17.533]  You take it as arrogance that I work 14, 16, sometimes 18 hours a day.
[00:49:17.533 --> 00:49:20.375]  You take it as arrogance that I'm confident and upset.
[00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:24.297]  And you start acting like the vaccine's okay.
[00:49:24.297 --> 00:49:26.859]  They're lying and saying you have to take it.
[00:49:27.702 --> 00:49:28.562]  Look at this headline.
[00:49:28.562 --> 00:49:30.703]  Perry requires HPV vaccine for girls.
[00:49:30.703 --> 00:49:31.463]  Next line.
[00:49:31.463 --> 00:49:34.283]  Parents can opt out of project targeting cancer-causing virus.
[00:49:34.283 --> 00:49:35.284]  There is no law.
[00:49:35.284 --> 00:49:36.664]  But all the time you hear them, it's the law.
[00:49:36.664 --> 00:49:39.104]  You gotta take all the vaccines.
[00:49:39.104 --> 00:49:44.826]  Then I read you the CDC saying it's very dangerous, causing major problems.
[00:49:44.826 --> 00:49:46.486]  Major side effects.
[00:49:46.486 --> 00:49:53.747]  I talk about how the UN's been caught all over the world adding sterilization pathogens to vaccines to sterilize people.
[00:49:53.747 --> 00:49:56.328]  I talk about eugenics programs by our criminal government.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.821]  You don't respond to any of that!
[00:49:59.821 --> 00:50:06.082]  You basically imply that I shouldn't be uppity, I shouldn't be speaking up, and that I'm angry and taking action is a threat to you.
[00:50:06.082 --> 00:50:07.102]  You know why it's a threat to you?
[00:50:07.102 --> 00:50:21.485]  Because you're a coward deep down inside, you don't want to take action, you don't want to stand up against evil, you're probably waiting for some imaginary rapture to happen that isn't even in the Bible, and you're just sitting there, and you're upset that somebody's pointing out bad things!
[00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:22.425]  I have a daughter!
[00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.631]  The government's pushing to try to make it the law.
[00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:26.412]  You have to take these.
[00:50:26.412 --> 00:50:27.252]  They haven't yet.
[00:50:27.252 --> 00:50:29.613]  So they try to convince the sheeple that it is the law.
[00:50:29.613 --> 00:50:33.295]  So most of you will just go ahead and do it.
[00:50:33.295 --> 00:50:41.639]  I have the Fourier request right here of the North American Union official government meeting where they're going to take all our liberties and freedoms and tax the daylights out of us.
[00:50:41.639 --> 00:50:43.700]  I'm upset about that.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.241]  You've got me completely and totally wrong.
[00:50:46.241 --> 00:50:48.703]  You don't know who I am.
[00:50:48.703 --> 00:50:51.324]  But forget who Alex Jones is.
[00:50:51.324 --> 00:50:53.025]  Can you face these issues?
[00:50:54.332 --> 00:50:56.234]  3.9 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[00:50:56.234 --> 00:50:59.016]  Completely open borders.
[00:50:59.016 --> 00:51:01.078]  While we lose all our liberties domestically.
[00:51:01.078 --> 00:51:04.180]  Can you get your head screwed on straight?
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:04.921]  Ah!
[00:51:04.921 --> 00:51:06.662]  Let's talk to Audrey in Chicago.
[00:51:06.662 --> 00:51:08.323]  She said she had cervical cancer.
[00:51:08.323 --> 00:51:09.984]  Has a comment on the vaccine.
[00:51:09.984 --> 00:51:10.705]  Thanks for holding.
[00:51:10.705 --> 00:51:11.345]  Welcome.
[00:51:11.345 --> 00:51:12.446]  Hi, Alex.
[00:51:12.446 --> 00:51:13.487]  Hi.
[00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:14.968]  I love your show.
[00:51:14.968 --> 00:51:15.909]  I'm a new convert.
[00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:17.731]  And I'm a liberal.
[00:51:17.731 --> 00:51:20.332]  I'm probably one of ten in your audience.
[00:51:20.332 --> 00:51:20.892]  Are you kidding?
[00:51:20.892 --> 00:51:22.513]  It's not about liberal or conservative.
[00:51:22.513 --> 00:51:25.134]  We have a massive audience across the political spectrum.
[00:51:25.134 --> 00:51:28.375]  Well, let me just tell you how I feel about the vaccine.
[00:51:28.375 --> 00:51:31.817]  When I first heard about it, I thought, oh yeah, wow, cool.
[00:51:31.817 --> 00:51:35.719]  Because I had cervical cancer when I was 21.
[00:51:35.719 --> 00:51:40.421]  My boyfriend gave me the HPV virus.
[00:51:40.421 --> 00:51:45.303]  But fortunately for me, I went to the gynecologist every year and I had a pap smear.
[00:51:45.816 --> 00:51:52.961]  And what I want to impress upon your listeners is that every woman should go every year for an annual gynecologist.
[00:51:52.961 --> 00:51:54.442]  Everybody should go.
[00:51:54.442 --> 00:51:55.483]  Yes.
[00:51:55.483 --> 00:52:00.787]  And you know, because it caught it early, I had treatment, it was caught in six weeks.
[00:52:00.787 --> 00:52:01.467]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:52:01.467 --> 00:52:02.908]  This is extremely treatable.
[00:52:02.908 --> 00:52:11.274]  If caught earlier, even in mid-stages, only 9,170 people get it, and a fraction of those actually die.
[00:52:11.274 --> 00:52:12.575]  Yeah, and you know what, Alex?
[00:52:12.575 --> 00:52:13.496]  The thing about this is
[00:52:15.576 --> 00:52:18.757]  HPV is a human behavior issue.
[00:52:18.757 --> 00:52:21.018]  It's not a vaccination issue.
[00:52:21.018 --> 00:52:29.102]  I'm very concerned because I'm a women's health activist and I know what damage Depo-Vera did to women.
[00:52:29.102 --> 00:52:31.703]  Oh my god, it's all sorts of sterilization programs.
[00:52:31.703 --> 00:52:32.704]  It's the limonide.
[00:52:32.704 --> 00:52:34.365]  I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right.
[00:52:34.365 --> 00:52:35.145]  I'm a little nervous.
[00:52:35.615 --> 00:52:41.797]  But yeah, I mean, think about those women who were taking it to prevent miscarriage, right?
[00:52:41.797 --> 00:52:53.400]  And then the kids that they had without arms and legs, and then the women who were taking Deprivera to prevent... Over 300,000 people a year die from bad drug reactions or bad drugs.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.060]  The cure is worse than the disease.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.701]  Did you hear me read the CDC saying, don't take this?
[00:52:59.701 --> 00:53:05.323]  Did you hear me reading the seizures and death and all the problems girls are having where girls are taking this?
[00:53:05.623 --> 00:53:13.736]  Yes, and the thing is, the whole key behind the women's health movement is that every woman should make an informed decision about what she's going to do to her body.
[00:53:14.318 --> 00:53:18.160]  I agree.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.241]  Let me ask you this question.
[00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:24.523]  Does it make you mad that Rick Perry's claiming it's the law when there is no law?
[00:53:24.523 --> 00:53:31.426]  He just signs an executive order that if you actually read it just says they're recommending it, but the news is trumpeting his lie that you have to take it?
[00:53:31.426 --> 00:53:32.286]  That's a fraud!
[00:53:32.286 --> 00:53:33.227]  It's a hoax!
[00:53:33.227 --> 00:53:34.427]  Well, I don't know.
[00:53:34.427 --> 00:53:35.588]  It makes me upset.
[00:53:36.048 --> 00:53:42.650]  And mad because I think no woman or any girl should be forced into taking a drug that hasn't been fully tested.
[00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.871]  Well, number one, why are they trying to make ten-year-old girls take this?
[00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:49.973]  I appreciate your call, glad you're on board, and everybody is welcome to this show.
[00:53:49.973 --> 00:53:52.213]  These liberal conservative terms mean nothing.
[00:53:52.213 --> 00:53:56.535]  It's all part of keeping us in a box and playing us off against each other, divide and conquer.
[00:53:58.242 --> 00:54:01.384]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in Dripping Springs.
[00:54:01.384 --> 00:54:02.244]  Gary, you're on the air.
[00:54:02.244 --> 00:54:02.904]  Go ahead.
[00:54:02.904 --> 00:54:03.405]  Hey, Alex.
[00:54:03.405 --> 00:54:03.965]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:03.965 --> 00:54:11.488]  On Rick Perry's order, his executive order, RP 65, I noticed you had stated that a parent has the right to opt out.
[00:54:11.488 --> 00:54:16.971]  Now, if you actually read the language, and I'm going to read it to you real quickly, it's only one sentence.
[00:54:16.971 --> 00:54:18.051]  I actually have it, but go ahead.
[00:54:18.051 --> 00:54:25.895]  But it says the Department of Parents' Rights and the Department of State Health Services will, in order to protect the right of parents to be the final authority of their children's health care,
[00:54:26.423 --> 00:54:34.150]  Modify the current process in order to allow parents to submit a request for a conscientious objection.
[00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:35.050]  Let me break this down.
[00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:37.352]  They don't have an empowering law.
[00:54:37.352 --> 00:54:45.700]  They pass a law on a regulation and then they condition you to sign the waiver forms that the schools fight to not even show you.
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:51.064]  So federal and state cases all over the nation show you don't even have to sign the waiver form.
[00:54:51.064 --> 00:54:51.965]  Here's the problem.
[00:54:52.305 --> 00:54:58.907]  They then suspend your child and use that as the criminal charge against you and the child when they're the ones that suspended.
[00:54:58.907 --> 00:55:10.210]  So people are ignorant, and they just believe there's a law when there isn't, and so to enforce, they bring in a real law, but they trigger the suspension, so it's been found in court to be a fraud.
[00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:10.710]  You understand?
[00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:11.991]  Yes, certainly, but the thing is...
[00:55:13.431 --> 00:55:18.036]  Doctors are already telling my daughter that this was a mandatory... It isn't!
[00:55:18.036 --> 00:55:18.457]  I know!
[00:55:18.457 --> 00:55:21.400]  It is a massive hoax and it makes me see red!
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:25.204]  And some cowardly chicken necks out there take that as me being arrogant!
[00:55:25.204 --> 00:55:28.187]  There is not a law that you have to take any vaccine!
[00:55:28.527 --> 00:55:31.969]  But there has been a sustained 10-year campaign every year.
[00:55:31.969 --> 00:55:32.470]  It's the law.
[00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:33.490]  Gotta take all the vaccines.
[00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.492]  Gotta take whatever the new recommended one is.
[00:55:35.492 --> 00:55:37.393]  There is no law.
[00:55:37.393 --> 00:55:44.858]  And now they've gone too far with the live cancer viruses that is causing seizures, autoimmune disorders, and death.
[00:55:44.858 --> 00:55:47.200]  And the CDC's saying don't take it.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.761]  Does that stop Rick Perry?
[00:55:48.761 --> 00:55:50.222]  Dr. Perry?
[00:55:50.222 --> 00:55:58.087]  Hell no, because right here in the AP and Reuters, he's totally paid off by Merck Pharmaceutical, the same folks that brought you Vioxx!
[00:55:59.471 --> 00:56:00.252]  I gotta settle down.
[00:56:00.252 --> 00:56:02.413]  It just... I mean, this is Orwellian!
[00:56:02.413 --> 00:56:14.721]  If we wrote a science fiction book about this 30 years ago where they lie and say there's laws that don't exist and try to make you take live cancer viruses, they're trying to make people, they're trying to get approval now to make you take a shot that attacks your brain?
[00:56:14.721 --> 00:56:17.823]  I mean, where's the Twilight Zone music when I need it?
[00:56:17.823 --> 00:56:20.244]  I can't handle it anymore!
[00:56:20.244 --> 00:56:24.627]  Let's go ahead and jam one more in here.
[00:56:24.627 --> 00:56:26.048]  Let's talk to William in Austin.
[00:56:26.048 --> 00:56:26.669]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:26.669 --> 00:56:27.169]  You're on the air.
[00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:29.633]  You know, I went the wrong line.
[00:56:29.633 --> 00:56:30.253]  Go ahead, William.
[00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:30.734]  You're on the air.
[00:56:30.734 --> 00:56:31.834]  Hey, Alex.
[00:56:31.834 --> 00:56:32.595]  How's it going?
[00:56:32.595 --> 00:56:33.315]  Good.
[00:56:33.315 --> 00:56:42.983]  Well, you know, whether it's drugs tested, anything like that, and we know it's perfectly harmless, for people to think that the state, government, or anybody
[00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:47.515]  Have the right to inject whatever they want into your body is just ridiculous.
[00:56:47.515 --> 00:56:51.116]  When they have this history of eugenics and sterilization through the vaccines.
[00:56:51.116 --> 00:56:53.337]  Even if they didn't have that history.
[00:56:53.337 --> 00:56:56.679]  Exactly!
[00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.859]  And they're claiming it's a law when it isn't.
[00:56:58.859 --> 00:57:00.860]  And he got paid off by the people.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.581]  And he, I mean, it's incredible!
[00:57:02.581 --> 00:57:02.961]  Right.
[00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:04.402]  It just goes on and on.
[00:57:04.402 --> 00:57:05.282]  And it's nothing new.
[00:57:05.282 --> 00:57:07.083]  Especially with Perry.
[00:57:07.763 --> 00:57:08.863]  He keeps doing it over and over.
[00:57:08.863 --> 00:57:11.104]  And he would have lost if there wasn't a three-way race.
[00:57:11.104 --> 00:57:14.145]  More and more I think that was staged.
[00:57:14.145 --> 00:57:17.846]  Well, why didn't we have a runoff even with him and Bill?
[00:57:17.846 --> 00:57:20.746]  Bill's any better, but still.
[00:57:20.746 --> 00:57:26.668]  Either way, like you said, this is the new world order takeover.
[00:57:26.668 --> 00:57:30.329]  They're going to do anything and everything they can to make sure bodies start dropping.
[00:57:32.525 --> 00:57:34.466]  Listen, I'm making a film about this.
[00:57:34.466 --> 00:57:35.706]  I've got BBC.
[00:57:35.706 --> 00:57:39.248]  I've got where they catch them putting stuff in the vaccines.
[00:57:39.248 --> 00:57:39.628]  Right.
[00:57:39.628 --> 00:57:40.909]  There's mercury in it!
[00:57:40.909 --> 00:57:44.490]  I mean, you didn't used to see autistic children 30 years ago.
[00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:48.772]  Now every high school and middle school has giant rooms filled with these poor kids.
[00:57:48.772 --> 00:57:53.193]  Every time I talk to somebody who's got an autistic child, I say, when did they get sick?
[00:57:53.193 --> 00:57:55.974]  And they say, oh, it's the third round of shots at 18 months.
[00:57:55.974 --> 00:57:57.375]  They had a seizure and were gone!
[00:57:57.575 --> 00:58:10.259]  That's right, and if anybody had half their brain to look half of this up, they'd understand why you're so riled up and they wouldn't try to attack you and call you fear monger when you realize that you have every reason to be afraid.
[00:58:10.259 --> 00:58:10.879]  Exactly!
[00:58:10.879 --> 00:58:11.619]  I'm freaked out!
[00:58:11.619 --> 00:58:12.539]  I got a family!
[00:58:12.539 --> 00:58:13.720]  I'm freaked out too!
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.660]  Then hell yeah we should be freaked out!
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.761]  I don't understand the lullabies that people have been taking.
[00:58:19.761 --> 00:58:20.261]  I hear you.
[00:58:20.261 --> 00:58:21.002]  We're out of time.
[00:58:21.002 --> 00:58:21.802]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:23.354 --> 00:58:24.494]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:58:57.101 --> 00:58:59.722]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:58:59.722 --> 00:59:03.545]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.

[00:59:24.753 --> 00:59:27.474]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:59:27.474 --> 00:59:29.915]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[00:59:29.915 --> 00:59:40.319]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?

[01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:21.275]  The President has declared four counties in Florida disaster areas following Friday's severe weather.
[01:01:21.275 --> 01:01:25.197]  USA Radio Network White House correspondent Connie Lawn reports from Washington.
[01:01:25.197 --> 01:01:34.480]  The White House says President Bush declared a major disaster exists in the state of Florida and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.722]  The President's action makes federal funding available to affected individuals
[01:01:39.222 --> 01:01:53.793]  Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disasters.
[01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.736]  Connie Lawn, USA Radio Network News, The White House.
[01:01:57.432 --> 01:02:12.427]  The Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to divert up to 1.3 billion dollars for levee repairs from the New Orleans-Mississippi River East Bank, which was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina, over to the West Bank, where tens of thousands of people have resettled.
[01:02:12.427 --> 01:02:18.833]  The Corps says the levees protecting the West Bank and the roughly 250,000 people who live there are inadequate.
[01:02:19.545 --> 01:02:24.050]  North Korea's top envoy to six-party talks on its nuclear program has told former U.S.
[01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:32.118]  officials Pyongyang wants more than half a million tons of fuel oil a year in return for suspending its atomic reactor.
[01:02:32.118 --> 01:02:35.401]  That demand exceeds assistance North Korea received in 1994.

[01:02:43.558 --> 01:02:46.180]  And this product, SkinZinc, it actually works.
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:47.700]  I love it because there's no steroids.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.401]  You just spray it on and it works.
[01:02:49.401 --> 01:02:51.042]  It's like having brand new skin.

[01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:30.592]  El Salvador is one of 64 nations working to win the war on terror.
[01:03:30.592 --> 01:03:35.315]  Salvador Navy Captain Guillermo Jimenez describes the significance of his country's contributions in Iraq.
[01:03:51.201 --> 01:03:56.346]  The first mission of this type in El Salvador's military history.
[01:03:56.346 --> 01:04:01.532]  My country executes its foreign policy through the military.
[01:04:01.532 --> 01:04:07.618]  Since 2003, El Salvador has contributed 26% of its military in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
[01:04:08.368 --> 01:04:09.529]  The highest-ranking U.S.
[01:04:09.529 --> 01:04:22.180]  general to lead troops in Afghanistan has taken command of the 35,500-strong NATO-led force, putting an American face on the international mission after nine months of British command.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:29.045]  General Dan McNeil has replaced British General David Richards at the helm of NATO's International Security and Assistance Force.
[01:04:29.045 --> 01:04:35.611]  And at least 20 people have been killed and 200,000 forced from their homes by floods in Indonesia's capital city.

[01:04:40.302 --> 01:04:44.284]  The IRS put a lien on my house, garnished my wages, and levied my bank account.
[01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:46.865]  My attorney referred me to Associated Tax Relief.
[01:04:46.865 --> 01:04:48.606]  Calling them was the best move I ever made.

[01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:19.986]  A new study finds that women who take folic acid supplements early in their pregnancy can substantially reduce their baby's chances of being born with a facial cleft.
[01:05:19.986 --> 01:05:28.770]  Dr. Alan Wilcox with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences says the time for women who are thinking about having a baby to start taking folic acid is now.
[01:05:29.722 --> 01:05:43.277]  One of the really important things for women to realize is that if they wait until they know that they're pregnant to start taking these vitamins, including folic acid, that it may be too late.
[01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:48.463]  Folic acid is a B vitamin found in leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, beans, and whole grains.

[01:07:44.324 --> 01:07:46.806]  It is Sunday, February 4th, 2007.
[01:07:46.806 --> 01:07:49.629]  Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:07:49.629 --> 01:07:52.992]  We got 54 minutes left in live broadcast.
[01:07:52.992 --> 01:07:54.433]  Loaded phone lines.
[01:07:54.433 --> 01:07:58.857]  John Connor joining us to talk about occult activities of the global elite.
[01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:01.159]  Hey, treat the strangers in fiction.
[01:08:01.159 --> 01:08:05.583]  We have a criminal control freak establishment completely out of control.
[01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:06.344]  We're here fighting
[01:08:07.188 --> 01:08:12.953]  We're here fighting the government lying and saying it's mandatory to take an experimental live cancer virus.
[01:08:12.953 --> 01:08:17.798]  They got them that attack your brain so you'll not get addicted to cigarettes.
[01:08:17.798 --> 01:08:19.920]  I mean, it's just, it's out of control.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.982]  I got North American news coming up.
[01:08:21.982 --> 01:08:24.504]  I got the Swiss government wants to start killing its people.
[01:08:24.504 --> 01:08:27.247]  They're going to decide with assisted suicide.
[01:08:27.247 --> 01:08:29.649]  I guess government sponsored euthanasia.
[01:08:30.914 --> 01:08:32.656]  It's all here on the roster.
[01:08:32.656 --> 01:08:34.437]  Let's blast through some more of your calls.
[01:08:34.437 --> 01:08:37.860]  Let's talk to Melody, calling in from Ohio.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.341]  Melody, thank you for holding.
[01:08:39.341 --> 01:08:41.223]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:08:41.223 --> 01:08:44.245]  Hey Alex, this is Emily's mom.
[01:08:44.245 --> 01:08:47.047]  I wanted to talk to you about vaccines because... Let me stop.
[01:08:47.047 --> 01:08:51.251]  Is Emily the girl from Ohio who called you as a student group on 9-11 Young?
[01:08:51.251 --> 01:08:54.273]  And she's definitely not going to take this vaccine.
[01:08:54.273 --> 01:08:57.536]  I started looking into the vaccines when you started talking about it.
[01:08:59.696 --> 01:09:03.118]  Me and my husband are both nurses, and we took the hepatitis vaccine.
[01:09:03.118 --> 01:09:04.578]  Oh, very dangerous.
[01:09:04.578 --> 01:09:08.700]  Well, uh, my husband has leukemia.
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:14.263]  And, uh, when I was going through looking through these vaccines... Cancer's up several thousand percent in the last 50 years.
[01:09:14.263 --> 01:09:15.304]  Something's going on.
[01:09:15.304 --> 01:09:22.447]  Well, that, leukemia is... The globalists openly say in documents they want to use vaccines for a worldwide population reduction.
[01:09:22.447 --> 01:09:26.629]  Yeah, but he's got leukemia, and that was one of the side effects from the hepatitis series.
[01:09:27.469 --> 01:09:29.750]  I was just floored.
[01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:37.611]  I know, my poor daddy's an oral surgeon slash dentist and they do, with healthcare workers, make you take it every couple years and my god.
[01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:49.454]  That's the other thing, the vaccine makers go and get regulations passed so that you have to take vaccines over and over again, whereas in the past they said tetanus works seven years, now they're saying every three.
[01:09:49.454 --> 01:09:52.295]  Whereas hepatitis was for every ten, now they're saying every three.
[01:09:52.295 --> 01:09:54.855]  It's just, it's incredible.
[01:09:54.855 --> 01:09:56.896]  What makes me think that this has to do with
[01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.315]  Discriminate to women.
[01:09:59.315 --> 01:10:03.899]  If men are carrying this virus also, you would think they would vaccinate both.
[01:10:03.899 --> 01:10:11.326]  So by vaccinating only the girls, it's almost like they want to... I think they're going to try to render them sterile to keep down the population.
[01:10:11.326 --> 01:10:18.813]  Well, it just so happens the UN has been caught from Colombia to Nigeria to Southeast Asia
[01:10:19.893 --> 01:10:21.695]  On purpose, the documents are public.
[01:10:21.695 --> 01:10:23.256]  This is BBC, folks.
[01:10:23.256 --> 01:10:25.918]  Adding to the tetanus shot in a U.N.
[01:10:25.918 --> 01:10:40.750]  program, 20-plus year program, got exposed in the mid-90s, just for girls, because they care about girls so much, a tetanus shot, because it wouldn't hurt boys, that had a very expensive synthetic hormone added to it, so that the body would then attack that hormone whenever it appeared.
[01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:45.193]  It only appears in the first trimester of pregnancy, causing violent miscarriages.
[01:10:45.193 --> 01:10:48.816]  And it was an admitted eugenic sterilization program.
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:52.021]  So again, this is diabolical.
[01:10:52.021 --> 01:10:54.422]  The globalists are the same people that funded Hitler.
[01:10:54.422 --> 01:10:55.562]  They're in control today.
[01:10:55.562 --> 01:10:59.344]  If you take this stuff, you're off your rocker.
[01:10:59.344 --> 01:11:08.647]  There was something I wanted to talk to you about, but not on the air, because I'm a nurse, and this was kind of something that once in a while I would try to talk to you about something later.
[01:11:08.647 --> 01:11:09.627]  Well, give us a hint of it.
[01:11:09.627 --> 01:11:13.189]  What is it?
[01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:14.189]  I don't know.
[01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:16.010]  It's in Texas like it is Ohio.
[01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.590]  Do you have to
[01:11:17.295 --> 01:11:20.837]  Do you get triggered when you go to the hospital that you've got to have a vaccine?
[01:11:20.837 --> 01:11:21.998]  Your flu shot?
[01:11:21.998 --> 01:11:22.738]  Well, yes.
[01:11:22.738 --> 01:11:24.239]  They push it on everybody.
[01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:26.840]  It's not the law, but they say you really need this.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:34.885]  And yeah, that's the big pharmaceutical companies have pushed these mandates to basically turn the medical staff into their salesmen.
[01:11:34.885 --> 01:11:35.825]  Yeah.
[01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:36.686]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:11:36.686 --> 01:11:38.987]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:38.987 --> 01:11:42.189]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Indianapolis, Indiana.
[01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:44.250]  Tim, thank you for calling.
[01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.291]  You're on to the air.
[01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:45.631]  Welcome.
[01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:47.576]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:11:47.576 --> 01:11:48.897]  Good, sir.
[01:11:48.897 --> 01:12:05.375]  Yeah, I'm from Indianapolis, and our team is playing the Super Bowl tonight, but the Constitution and my Bill of Rights are being destroyed by this global stiff, and therefore I'm talking to you right now, so... The reason I called in was about the National ID Act.
[01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:10.277]  Passed in 2005, becomes law in 2008.
[01:12:10.277 --> 01:12:18.420]  All 50 states have now adopted national ID cards standardized to the driver's license, and they're really a North American ID card.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:24.223]  Yeah, an article came out today from the AP talking about different states.
[01:12:24.223 --> 01:12:30.266]  Some are revolting, and I guess some are going... That's what they're saying because the population is revolting.
[01:12:30.266 --> 01:12:31.026]  It's really not true.
[01:12:32.512 --> 01:12:33.132]  Yeah.
[01:12:33.132 --> 01:12:42.858]  Well, there are a couple Maine's trying to pull out, so is New Hampshire, but generally, like, Texas has been complaining, but only for more federal funds to implement it.
[01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:51.163]  Yeah, it says in here that Indiana's one of the states that's going to go ahead and push for it, I guess, which I found very disappointing.
[01:12:51.163 --> 01:12:54.145]  Well, Indiana's having its roads handed over to the Arabs and the Spanish.
[01:12:54.145 --> 01:12:55.586]  It's all part of the same globalist plan.
[01:12:55.586 --> 01:12:57.127]  Oh, yeah, definitely.
[01:12:57.127 --> 01:13:01.850]  I guess the governor's on the same page as the Bushes and everybody else in Washington,
[01:13:02.925 --> 01:13:07.230]  I'm probably going to go ahead and contact my state representative.
[01:13:16.984 --> 01:13:20.505]  Let's go ahead now and take another call before we go to break.
[01:13:20.505 --> 01:13:23.325]  Let's talk to Tommy in Arlington, Tejas.
[01:13:23.325 --> 01:13:31.046]  He wants to talk about the new Merck vaccine, the live cancer virus causing deaths and seizures and a lot of other autoimmune responses.
[01:13:31.046 --> 01:13:41.768]  And the CDC says don't take it, but Rick Perry says he's God, he's Dr. Rick, and he's on the payroll of Merck publicly, and he just says you're going to have to take it, but then you read it's not even a law, he just is mandating it.
[01:13:41.768 --> 01:13:44.009]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:13:44.009 --> 01:13:44.969]  Alex, good to speak with you.
[01:13:46.599 --> 01:13:51.720]  I'm one of your anti-tyranny minions, and a long-time supporter of your work.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:14:02.223]  I have the phone number for Merck, if you'd like me to... Well, that's kind of like calling Satan and telling Satan, you know, human sacrifice is going on, or calling Hitler and saying there's anti-Semitism in the world.
[01:14:02.223 --> 01:14:07.604]  But it's important if you own Merck stock to dump it, to morally go see if it's in your mutual fund and dump it.
[01:14:08.284 --> 01:14:11.107]  It's important to just tell everybody that has a young girl.
[01:14:11.107 --> 01:14:11.847]  You've got a son.
[01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.008]  Your neighbor's got a girl.
[01:14:13.008 --> 01:14:14.429]  Go, hey, here's some news articles.
[01:14:14.429 --> 01:14:15.090]  It's not the law.
[01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:15.930]  It's a fraud.
[01:14:15.930 --> 01:14:17.191]  He's on Merck payroll.
[01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:21.995]  Here's the CDC saying it'll make your daughter bleed out her nose and die and flopping around on the ground.
[01:14:21.995 --> 01:14:25.238]  And you know, that's how we fight these bastards.
[01:14:25.238 --> 01:14:26.639]  Well, Alex, good on you.
[01:14:26.639 --> 01:14:31.863]  If you want to take me off the air to one of your screeners, I've got a very strong aviation background.
[01:14:31.863 --> 01:14:33.144]  This is off topic, but I've
[01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:40.990]  I'm one of the folks that was fired after the events of 9-11, and so obviously I have a chip on my shoulder, but I've got a pretty strong aviation background.
[01:14:46.061 --> 01:14:51.366]  From a professional's perspective on commercial aviation, I'd be more than happy to end my service here.
[01:14:51.366 --> 01:14:52.987]  Sure, we'll get your info.
[01:14:52.987 --> 01:14:54.989]  In fact, I actually hung up on him.
[01:14:54.989 --> 01:14:56.350]  Call back.
[01:14:56.350 --> 01:15:00.914]  In fact, remember a few weeks ago that person called who was setting up secret security cameras at the WTC?
[01:15:00.914 --> 01:15:02.075]  Do you still have that number?
[01:15:02.075 --> 01:15:02.755]  I never got it.
[01:15:02.755 --> 01:15:03.756]  Give it to me again.
[01:15:03.756 --> 01:15:05.157]  I forgot about that.
[01:15:05.157 --> 01:15:07.239]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Austin.
[01:15:07.239 --> 01:15:08.100]  Mark, thanks for holding.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:08.740]  You're on the air.
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.161]  Go ahead.
[01:15:09.161 --> 01:15:10.502]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:10.502 --> 01:15:11.142]  How are you?
[01:15:11.142 --> 01:15:11.463]  Good, sir.
[01:15:11.463 --> 01:15:11.763]  Go ahead.
[01:15:12.628 --> 01:15:13.369]  Hey, good work.
[01:15:13.369 --> 01:15:21.155]  I remember my talks 15, 20 years ago, reading about all the topics you cover, and now I just nod and go, uh-huh, yep, it's all true.
[01:15:21.155 --> 01:15:23.457]  I had a question on the vaccines.
[01:15:23.457 --> 01:15:29.482]  Myself, I have a form of autism called Asperger's Disorder, but I remember my brother was much older.
[01:15:29.482 --> 01:15:37.408]  He would have been vaccinated years ago, perhaps in the 60s, and he always had a scar that looked like a wagon wheel, but I've never seen that anywhere else.
[01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:41.931]  You know, I don't know the particulars of your brother, but this is what happens.
[01:15:41.931 --> 01:15:45.252]  Autism was unknown until about 35 years ago.
[01:15:45.252 --> 01:15:50.393]  Again, it's gone from 1 in 25,000 22 years ago to 1 in 168.
[01:15:50.393 --> 01:15:53.594]  The new numbers are saying less than 1 in 80.
[01:15:53.594 --> 01:15:57.274]  You go to these high schools, literal whole rooms filled with these people.
[01:15:57.274 --> 01:15:58.315]  You talk to every parent.
[01:15:58.315 --> 01:15:59.095]  I've done it.
[01:15:59.095 --> 01:15:59.415]  And I go,
[01:16:00.195 --> 01:16:01.076]  When did it happen?
[01:16:01.076 --> 01:16:05.139]  They had a seizure at 18 months, the day after the last round of shots.
[01:16:05.139 --> 01:16:07.740]  That's when the mercury builds to mega-toxic levels.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:18.688]  Then there are genes that allow even heavier absorption of mercury through the gut, so that it adds with the other vaccine mercury you've gotten, and that's why it runs in families even worse.
[01:16:18.688 --> 01:16:20.509]  So it hits some people even harder.
[01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:24.031]  And I've just interviewed Nobel Prize winners and probably 30, 40 doctors over the years on this.
[01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:24.772]  That's why I know about it.
[01:16:25.973 --> 01:16:26.133]  Yeah.
[01:16:26.133 --> 01:16:26.874]  All right.
[01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:27.494]  Thanks.
[01:16:27.494 --> 01:16:28.675]  Thank you for the call.
[01:16:28.675 --> 01:16:32.238]  John Connor joining us on a completely different subject.
[01:16:32.238 --> 01:16:34.359]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:16:34.359 --> 01:16:37.081]  Why would our leaders be trying to poison us with vaccines?
[01:16:37.081 --> 01:16:38.442]  Why would they fund Hitler?
[01:16:38.442 --> 01:16:40.183]  Why would they fund Stalin and Mao?
[01:16:40.183 --> 01:16:41.985]  What's their worldview?
[01:16:41.985 --> 01:16:45.947]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com are the websites.
[01:16:45.947 --> 01:16:51.711]  We'll plunge into Rush Limbaugh commenting on it with John Connor on the other side.
[01:16:51.711 --> 01:16:52.252]  Stay with us.
[01:17:07.853 --> 01:17:09.735]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:17:09.735 --> 01:17:11.016]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:17:11.016 --> 01:17:14.419]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:17:14.419 --> 01:17:17.141]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:17:17.711 --> 01:17:24.997]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:17:24.997 --> 01:17:33.624]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[01:17:48.377 --> 01:17:48.737]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:17:48.737 --> 01:17:51.359]  And express your freedom of speech today.
[01:17:51.359 --> 01:17:52.040]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:52.300]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:18:07.105 --> 01:18:11.168]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:18:11.168 --> 01:18:17.073]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:18:17.073 --> 01:18:18.174]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:18:18.174 --> 01:18:22.217]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:18:22.877 --> 01:18:36.684]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:42.287]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report, Explaining the Boundaries of Trading Precious Metals Privately.
[01:18:42.287 --> 01:18:48.170]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:18:48.917 --> 01:18:50.199]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:18:50.199 --> 01:18:51.721]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:18:51.721 --> 01:18:52.342]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:54.385]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:18:54.385 --> 01:18:54.446]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:10.589 --> 01:19:16.397]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:19:16.397 --> 01:19:24.047]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:19:24.730 --> 01:19:32.172]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:19:32.172 --> 01:19:43.915]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:19:43.915 --> 01:19:47.876]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:19:47.876 --> 01:19:50.137]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:19:50.137 --> 01:19:53.978]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:20:07.449 --> 01:20:12.134]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:20:12.134 --> 01:20:13.195]  have diabetes.
[01:20:13.195 --> 01:20:20.282]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:24.806]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:20:25.006 --> 01:20:27.967]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:20:41.212 --> 01:20:41.872]  We're good to go!
[01:21:07.632 --> 01:21:13.074]  Are you tired of searching for BrickTalk Radio?
[01:21:13.074 --> 01:21:14.354]  Well, search no more.
[01:21:14.354 --> 01:21:19.716]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:21:19.716 --> 01:21:21.917]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:21:21.917 --> 01:21:24.018]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:21:24.018 --> 01:21:25.578]  Here's Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:21:25.578 --> 01:21:26.578]  Central Time.
[01:21:26.578 --> 01:21:27.819]  It's 5 to 7 p.m.
[01:21:27.819 --> 01:21:29.940]  Eastern.
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:30.820]  3 to 5, Mountain.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.440]  2 to 4, Pacific.
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.441]  Affiliates now, coast to coast, dotting the landscape.
[01:21:35.441 --> 01:21:36.782]  More joining us every week.
[01:21:37.742 --> 01:21:40.224]  Dodd and Corpus Christi, Texas, stay there.
[01:21:40.224 --> 01:21:42.346]  Steve, North Carolina, stay there.
[01:21:42.346 --> 01:21:44.528]  Wellington and Louisiana, stay there.
[01:21:44.528 --> 01:21:47.050]  We'll get to everybody.
[01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:55.316]  I want to get more into the vaccines, some new North American Union news, state-sponsored euthanasia news out of Sweden.
[01:21:55.316 --> 01:21:58.599]  But before I do that, at the end of the transmission today,
[01:21:59.349 --> 01:22:05.572]  John Connor has a syndicated radio broadcast on my own syndicator, Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:22:05.572 --> 01:22:13.636]  And John started his career a few years ago out of college with Guerrilla Information Warfare, calling into radio talk shows, going out and confronting Hollywood celebs on the streets.
[01:22:13.636 --> 01:22:16.858]  He lives in San Diego, so he goes up to L.A.
[01:22:18.286 --> 01:22:24.150]  And this week he called in to Rush Limbaugh's shows, attacked me before, because he's jealous and I'm more conservative than he is.
[01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:25.551]  No, not bashing Rush here.
[01:22:25.551 --> 01:22:27.452]  The point is, all's fair in love and war.
[01:22:27.452 --> 01:22:29.434]  I don't really spend time on these guys.
[01:22:29.434 --> 01:22:33.637]  Neil Bortz talks about me almost every day now, says I'm the equivalent of a half-eaten fruitcake.
[01:22:33.637 --> 01:22:34.177]  Hey, great!
[01:22:34.177 --> 01:22:35.498]  I talk about real issues.
[01:22:35.498 --> 01:22:39.281]  They may be shocking and sensational, but they're real.
[01:22:39.281 --> 01:22:45.645]  And I remember in 1999, the international British media, with World of Wonder,
[01:22:46.303 --> 01:22:46.803]  We're good to go.
[01:23:04.614 --> 01:23:08.356]  Because of liability, we can't sneak into a place called Bohemian Grove, have you heard of it?
[01:23:08.356 --> 01:23:13.099]  And in 99, I was Mr. Anti-Federal Reserve Income Tax, a lot more mainline conservative.
[01:23:13.099 --> 01:23:16.021]  I hadn't gotten into the weird issues, because I didn't know they were real.
[01:23:16.021 --> 01:23:26.427]  Now, yeah, I heard that all these global elitists, royalty, presidents go to Northern California in this gorge, and they've been doing it for over 100 years, and they do these weird rituals.
[01:23:26.427 --> 01:23:31.970]  They said, well, we know people that work there, and it's all true, and we know when they do the big ritual, would you like to sneak in there and videotape it?
[01:23:32.845 --> 01:23:35.766]  And I said, yeah, I'll do it, sure.
[01:23:35.766 --> 01:23:38.287]  And I didn't believe that I would really see what I saw.
[01:23:38.287 --> 01:23:44.150]  Exactly what all the rumors and the legends had claimed happened.
[01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:52.794]  And since then, the New York Post, New York Daily News, the Associated Press, the New York Times have reported that they bus in male prostitutes
[01:23:54.518 --> 01:24:00.260]  This is the heads of almost all the major corporations, banking, Federal Reserve, mainly Republican politicians.
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.801]  Now you've heard about all that with Foley and the rest of it.
[01:24:02.801 --> 01:24:08.263]  And headline, top gay porn star services moguls at Bohemian Grove, New York Post.
[01:24:08.263 --> 01:24:11.505]  That's Rupert Murdoch saying that.
[01:24:11.505 --> 01:24:15.406]  Well, in 2004, before I play this Limbaugh clip and go to John Connor,
[01:24:17.045 --> 01:24:24.768]  In 2004, I'm walking along covering the RNC for the network I'm on, and I see David Gergen, the Karl Rove of four administrations.
[01:24:24.768 --> 01:24:25.449]  David Gergen.
[01:24:25.449 --> 01:24:26.989]  I mean, much bigger than Karl Rove.
[01:24:26.989 --> 01:24:30.290]  Worked for Republican and Democratic.
[01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:35.673]  Clinton, Bush Senior, Reagan, Nixon, the list goes on and on.
[01:24:35.673 --> 01:24:39.194]  And I walk up, and I talk to him about the RNC, and then I see one last question.
[01:24:39.753 --> 01:24:46.137]  So just so you know how real this is, just type David Gergen into YouTube or Google, and Alex Jones after it, and you'll get these clips.
[01:24:46.137 --> 01:24:48.559]  It's in my film, Martial Law.
[01:24:48.559 --> 01:24:52.842]  It's also in my film, The Order of Death, available on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:52.842 --> 01:24:54.543]  You can watch it for free on the web.
[01:24:54.543 --> 01:24:55.364]  We've uploaded it.
[01:24:55.364 --> 01:24:56.765]  We want you to see this information.
[01:24:56.765 --> 01:24:59.226]  Here he is blowing up over the rituals.
[01:24:59.226 --> 01:25:01.128]  And I bring up an article he was in.
[01:25:02.043 --> 01:25:08.807]  In the Washington Times, I said 96, it was really 93, where he said, don't worry, I don't run around naked in the woods like the rest of them.
[01:25:08.807 --> 01:25:10.448]  And that is indeed what goes on there.
[01:25:10.448 --> 01:25:14.170]  So here it is, then we'll go to John Connor, then to Limbaugh Clip.
[01:25:14.170 --> 01:25:18.333]  Here's David Gergen, 2004, RNC, outside Madison Square Garden, I'm talking to him.
[01:25:20.126 --> 01:25:21.547]  One last question.
[01:25:21.547 --> 01:25:31.711]  I read a Washington Times article many years ago, where you had a comment about the organization, and then now it's been in the Wall Street Journal, it's been in a lot of different newspapers, and that's the Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:31.711 --> 01:25:40.674]  And back in, what was it, 1996, when you joined as a Clinton advisor, the Republicans were criticizing you, oh, what about Bohemian Grove?
[01:25:40.674 --> 01:25:45.156]  And then you countered them by saying, hey, I don't run around in the woods naked.
[01:25:45.156 --> 01:25:45.576]  What did that mean?
[01:25:49.057 --> 01:25:52.720]  And this is what happens when you play stuff off the web without recording it.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.081]  I don't know what quote you're referring to.
[01:25:55.081 --> 01:25:57.223]  I'm not aware of any quote like that.
[01:25:57.223 --> 01:26:02.766]  Listen, I am a happy member of the Bohemian Grove.
[01:26:02.766 --> 01:26:05.048]  I like the folks who come there.
[01:26:05.048 --> 01:26:10.692]  And it's really inappropriate for me to talk about the group beyond that.
[01:26:10.692 --> 01:26:11.332]  Thank you.
[01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:15.355]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of Kerr?
[01:26:15.355 --> 01:26:18.357]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[01:26:33.681 --> 01:26:36.183]  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of care?
[01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:41.374]  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
[01:26:41.374 --> 01:26:41.755]  Really?
[01:26:41.755 --> 01:26:42.615]  That's right.
[01:26:42.615 --> 01:26:45.197]  Well, I'm Alex Jones, and I snuck in there in 2000.
[01:26:45.197 --> 01:26:47.498]  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
[01:26:47.498 --> 01:26:48.759]  It's been on national TV.
[01:26:48.759 --> 01:26:50.519]  Well, I disrespect you for that.
[01:26:50.519 --> 01:26:51.000]  You do?
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:51.240]  I do.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.881]  But there's a lot of big public officials going in there.
[01:26:53.881 --> 01:26:54.722]  Don't we deserve to know?
[01:26:54.722 --> 01:26:58.044]  I don't know anything about you, and I don't know anything about your film.
[01:26:58.044 --> 01:27:02.226]  But if you go in there with an understanding, you violate that understanding by releasing that film, and I don't respect you for that.
[01:27:02.873 --> 01:27:04.654]  Really?
[01:27:04.654 --> 01:27:08.335]  I'm sorry, you took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
[01:27:08.335 --> 01:27:10.115]  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
[01:27:10.115 --> 01:27:10.516]  No.
[01:27:10.516 --> 01:27:11.556]  Did you crash it?
[01:27:11.556 --> 01:27:12.036]  Yes.
[01:27:12.036 --> 01:27:14.117]  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there, too, does it?
[01:27:14.117 --> 01:27:15.977]  No, they put them on after.
[01:27:15.977 --> 01:27:16.818]  Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
[01:27:16.818 --> 01:27:17.638]  I've been there before.
[01:27:17.638 --> 01:27:22.039]  I know what the circumstances are, and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
[01:27:22.039 --> 01:27:23.460]  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.280]  But what about the ritual?
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.381]  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
[01:27:33.263 --> 01:27:37.624]  Sir, I don't owe you this comment.
[01:27:37.624 --> 01:27:44.686]  This is what's called ambush journalism, and I disrespect you for that as well, so thank you.
[01:27:44.686 --> 01:27:48.767]  It's none of your damn business.
[01:27:48.767 --> 01:27:50.507]  Listen, listen.
[01:27:50.507 --> 01:27:55.048]  You go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
[01:27:55.048 --> 01:27:59.489]  You ambush people on the streets, and that's an inappropriate form of journalism.
[01:27:59.489 --> 01:28:02.770]  If you wish to practice that, that's fine, but don't ask others to respect you for it.
[01:28:03.675 --> 01:28:06.339]  You can do your free American like anything you want.
[01:28:06.339 --> 01:28:09.724]  If you want to be uncivil, and rude, and ungentlemanly, that's up to you.
[01:28:09.724 --> 01:28:12.848]  But don't expect the rest of us to say, oh well, you're a Mr. Gergen.
[01:28:12.848 --> 01:28:14.851]  I'm sorry, nobody says policy in there.
[01:28:14.851 --> 01:28:18.356]  We try to be gentlemen, and obviously, you don't belong there.
[01:28:18.356 --> 01:28:19.578]  Weaving spiders coming out here?
[01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:21.857]  All right.
[01:28:21.857 --> 01:28:37.285]  Now, again, that's from a clip from my film, Martial Law, and so every time we make a comment, we would intersperse hidden video footage I got of the ritual, which the Grove admits I got, and they're very mad at me about it, and they commented for the international television program that's aired here on national cable.
[01:28:37.285 --> 01:28:38.666]  So, I mean, here I am.
[01:28:38.666 --> 01:28:39.967]  He's the one not being gentlemanly.
[01:28:39.967 --> 01:28:41.888]  He's the one saying, none of your damn business.
[01:28:41.888 --> 01:28:44.229]  He's the one getting in my face.
[01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:48.492]  And the things that you've heard about the Grove, indeed, do go on there, just like skull and bones.
[01:28:49.356 --> 01:28:52.159]  And it is bizarre to the max.
[01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:53.881]  Let's bring up John Connor for a few minutes.
[01:28:53.881 --> 01:29:01.549]  We're going to go to break and come back and play a clip of Limbaugh, who sure knows a lot about it, to claim he's never been there, but then he says he'll never be invited back.
[01:29:01.549 --> 01:29:04.392]  So, kind of some slip-ups going on there.
[01:29:04.392 --> 01:29:06.474]  Good to have you on with us, John Connor.
[01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:11.620]  Well, David Gergen says he disrespects you for that myself, and millions of others give you the utmost.
[01:29:12.159 --> 01:29:13.940]  Respect for doing what needs to be done.
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:18.042]  And notice how he doesn't deny the ritual or ask you, what ritual?
[01:29:18.042 --> 01:29:19.123]  What are you talking about?
[01:29:19.123 --> 01:29:21.164]  He gets very angry.
[01:29:21.164 --> 01:29:25.447]  And if he didn't know about a ritual, if there was no ritual, he would have answered very differently.
[01:29:25.447 --> 01:29:32.551]  But by saying it was none of your damn business, I think it's very clear how involved he is in the Bohemian.
[01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:35.432]  And he's known for being very calm, having great aplomb.
[01:29:35.432 --> 01:29:36.473]  He loses it.
[01:29:36.473 --> 01:29:37.553]  He's like 6'9".
[01:29:37.553 --> 01:29:40.395]  He starts towering over me, poking me in the chest.
[01:29:41.287 --> 01:29:42.107]  Uh, just amazing.
[01:29:42.107 --> 01:29:46.529]  Well, we'll come back and hear what Rush Limbaugh has to say about this.
[01:29:46.529 --> 01:29:47.269]  All right?
[01:29:47.269 --> 01:29:48.069]  With John Connor.
[01:29:48.069 --> 01:29:49.030]  John, stay there, my friend.
[01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:53.371]  And then we'll continue with your phone calls on the Super Bowl Sunday.

[01:30:59.035 --> 01:31:01.316]  Can you believe you can find all this at one stop?
[01:31:07.602 --> 01:31:13.648]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:31:13.648 --> 01:31:16.391]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business.
[01:31:20.382 --> 01:31:24.065]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:31:24.065 --> 01:31:26.287]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[01:31:26.287 --> 01:31:31.991]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common-sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[01:31:31.991 --> 01:31:40.999]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[01:31:40.999 --> 01:31:44.041]  Be one of the many thousands of loyal readers of The Nationalist Times.
[01:31:44.121 --> 01:31:44.441]  I think so.
[01:32:07.049 --> 01:32:12.013]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:32:12.013 --> 01:32:15.275]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:32:15.275 --> 01:32:18.198]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:32:18.198 --> 01:32:23.401]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:32:23.401 --> 01:32:29.066]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:32:29.066 --> 01:32:32.048]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:32:32.208 --> 01:32:32.909]  We're good to go.
[01:32:55.623 --> 01:33:00.969]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:33:00.969 --> 01:33:01.170]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:33:06.829 --> 01:33:08.230]  How are you feeling today?
[01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:15.376]  I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[01:33:15.376 --> 01:33:20.139]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call mangosteen.
[01:33:20.139 --> 01:33:26.504]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[01:33:26.504 --> 01:33:31.728]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potentials of this amazing fruit.
[01:33:31.728 --> 01:33:36.352]  This powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over
[01:33:36.732 --> 01:33:36.992]  I think so.
[01:34:08.544 --> 01:34:13.205]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:34:13.205 --> 01:34:21.007]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:34:21.007 --> 01:34:29.949]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:34.824 --> 01:34:35.966]  I know we got a load of phone lines.
[01:34:35.966 --> 01:34:38.109]  We'll jam your calls in before the transmission ends.
[01:34:38.109 --> 01:34:40.293]  John Connor is my guest.
[01:34:40.293 --> 01:34:43.398]  I went back to the archives, John, to play that David Gergen clip.
[01:34:43.398 --> 01:34:48.606]  Again, the Karl Rove of at least four administrations to show him blowing up and not denying the rituals.
[01:34:49.133 --> 01:34:53.214]  To point out that just because normal people don't engage in this doesn't mean the elites aren't.
[01:34:53.214 --> 01:35:03.376]  And throughout history, Hitler was into the occult, Stalin was into the occult, Nancy Reagan, every decision they made was off of astrologers, and that, you know, that's the light stuff.
[01:35:03.376 --> 01:35:13.079]  Tony Blair, mainstream news, that he's always doing weird rituals and channels some spirit called the light and flops around on the ground every morning and does weird Aztec rituals.
[01:35:13.079 --> 01:35:14.479]  I mean, there's so much of this.
[01:35:15.459 --> 01:35:18.642]  John Connor from your study at www.resistancemanifesto.com.
[01:35:18.642 --> 01:35:19.703]  Why are they doing this?
[01:35:19.703 --> 01:35:22.425]  I want to comment first on the ritual itself.
[01:35:22.425 --> 01:35:26.148]  It's very, very important to understand that this just isn't an ordinary ritual.
[01:35:26.148 --> 01:35:27.329]  This isn't a bonfire.
[01:35:27.329 --> 01:35:32.793]  They're not burning a bag of leaves or a bunch of logs in front of this huge statue of Moloch.
[01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:36.836]  This is a human sacrifice using an effigy of a human.
[01:35:36.836 --> 01:35:41.660]  Which I now found a video clip of Anton LaVey online saying that's what they did was kill babies in effigy.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.223]  Yeah, this is a satanic ritual to Moloch.
[01:35:46.223 --> 01:35:51.588]  Moloch in the Bible, in the Old Testament, was an ancient god that people used to burn children alive.
[01:35:51.588 --> 01:35:54.310]  Give not your children to the fires of Moloch, Leviticus.
[01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:55.151]  Correct.
[01:35:55.151 --> 01:35:56.272]  Leviticus 18.21.
[01:35:56.272 --> 01:35:58.594]  Do not sacrifice your children to the god Moloch.
[01:35:58.594 --> 01:36:01.236]  So these people are doing this as a mockery.
[01:36:01.616 --> 01:36:05.358]  Towards God, even though this is an effigy of a human being.
[01:36:05.358 --> 01:36:09.501]  Also, in the ritual, they say that they're destroying care, putting it in a box.
[01:36:09.501 --> 01:36:19.427]  In the Faustian book, written 300-400 years ago, Faust is trying to find care, or the conscience, the demon, Mephistopheles, to put in a box.
[01:36:19.427 --> 01:36:19.747]  Correct.
[01:36:19.747 --> 01:36:21.048]  They destroy care.
[01:36:21.048 --> 01:36:22.229]  They do not care.
[01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:27.192]  The philosophy, the mindset of these elite individuals is a satanic worldview.
[01:36:28.633 --> 01:36:31.357]  Well, how else could they put cancer viruses in vaccines?
[01:36:31.357 --> 01:36:33.119]  How else could they sterilize people?
[01:36:33.119 --> 01:36:34.580]  How else could they do all this evil?
[01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:38.505]  Yeah, how else could they go to war based on lie for profit to create a police state, correct?
[01:36:38.505 --> 01:36:41.088]  They literally have a satanic worldview.
[01:36:41.088 --> 01:36:42.650]  What this means is that
[01:36:43.132 --> 01:36:45.554]  They do not care about other people.
[01:36:45.554 --> 01:36:48.956]  All religions, all normal good religions have rules.
[01:36:48.956 --> 01:36:51.137]  Do as thou wilt, they come first.
[01:36:51.137 --> 01:36:51.478]  Correct.
[01:36:51.478 --> 01:36:56.001]  Do as thou wilt is the satanic philosophy of the 20th century Satanist.
[01:36:56.001 --> 01:36:57.402]  It is the whole of the law.
[01:36:57.402 --> 01:37:04.086]  Aleister Crowley, who writes about sacrificing children to Satan in his books, writes instructions for it for other Satanists.
[01:37:04.642 --> 01:37:07.943]  And essentially, these people have a predatory worldview.
[01:37:07.943 --> 01:37:09.604]  They do not care about other people.
[01:37:09.604 --> 01:37:10.984]  They believe it's survival of the fittest.
[01:37:10.984 --> 01:37:14.005]  It's their right to rule and feed and kill us because we're too stupid.
[01:37:14.005 --> 01:37:16.186]  Yeah, this is the same philosophy that Adolf Hitler had.
[01:37:16.186 --> 01:37:24.129]  Adolf Hitler's favorite book was The Secret Doctrine, written by Helena Blavatsky, where it literally says that Satan is good, that God is bad.
[01:37:24.129 --> 01:37:28.831]  This goes back to the Garden of Eden, where everybody, even if they're not a Christian, they know the story of Adam and Eve.
[01:37:28.831 --> 01:37:31.391]  Look, eyes wide shut is real.
[01:37:31.391 --> 01:37:32.852]  Yeah, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:37:34.288 --> 01:37:36.495]  There are many allegations going back into the 1980s.
[01:37:36.495 --> 01:37:36.836]  Former Senator...
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:49.769]  Former Senator John DeCamp, former head of the LA FBI, Ted Gunderson, make allegations and have eyewitnesses of snuff films and real satanic rituals performed in the Bohemian Grove in 1984.
[01:37:49.769 --> 01:38:00.658]  And this is a book published, a Virginia TV station said it wasn't true, and Senator John DeCamp, a Republican, former CIA, sued them and won defamation in court.
[01:38:00.658 --> 01:38:03.941]  There were arrests made off the info that came out.
[01:38:04.562 --> 01:38:12.959]  There at the Savings and Loan with Larry King, not the Larry King you know, a black Larry King who sung the National Anthem at the Republican National Convention in 1984.
[01:38:15.862 --> 01:38:21.906]  What these people believe is they believe that God, the God that created us, was actually a substandard God, an evil and jealous God.
[01:38:21.906 --> 01:38:25.668]  They believe that Satan rebelled from heaven to save humanity.
[01:38:25.668 --> 01:38:30.551]  They believe that following the teachings of Lucifer is actually good and that God was holding back.
[01:38:30.551 --> 01:38:34.634]  And by disrespecting and disobeying God, they themselves become gods.
[01:38:34.634 --> 01:38:38.376]  They have no rules other than the rules that they set, which goes back to the do what thou wilt.
[01:38:38.536 --> 01:38:46.159]  Well, I mean, even if you go see The Good Shepherd, it's got satanic rituals, and that's about the founding of the CIA out of skull and bones, everything we've told you.
[01:38:46.159 --> 01:38:47.219]  Here's this Limbaugh clip.
[01:38:47.219 --> 01:38:51.821]  I can't play the whole thing, and obviously I don't think Limbaugh's involved in all this stuff.
[01:38:51.821 --> 01:38:54.222]  But he obviously knows all about it.
[01:38:54.222 --> 01:38:56.463]  First, he says he knows nothing about it to you when you call in.
[01:38:56.983 --> 01:39:06.510]  Then he goes on to detailing it in precise detail, then he poo-poos that, and then he basically says that the most basic stuff that happens there doesn't indeed happen.
[01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:07.671]  We'll put you on hold for a second.
[01:39:07.671 --> 01:39:09.473]  John Connor, here you are calling in.
[01:39:09.473 --> 01:39:11.134]  What day was this last week?
[01:39:11.134 --> 01:39:12.215]  This was Thursday.
[01:39:12.215 --> 01:39:17.299]  This is Thursday on Lord Limbaugh's program, carried by this station and many other affiliates that pick up the show.
[01:39:17.299 --> 01:39:19.340]  He's attacked me many times, so I'm not allowed to play this.
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:21.262]  And I'm not even attacking Limbaugh here.
[01:39:21.262 --> 01:39:22.703]  It's just interesting to hear this brought up.
[01:39:22.703 --> 01:39:23.964]  Here it is.
[01:39:23.964 --> 01:39:26.406]  John in San Diego, you're next on the EIB network.
[01:39:26.406 --> 01:39:26.606]  Hello.
[01:39:27.347 --> 01:39:36.553]  Since I have you on the line, Rush, have you seen the video of the Bohemian Grove ceremony that Alex Jones produced that's on Google Video?
[01:39:36.553 --> 01:39:36.974]  Uh, no.
[01:39:36.974 --> 01:39:40.556]  I've been invited to Bohemian Grove, but I've never been there.
[01:39:40.556 --> 01:39:42.357]  And I've not seen the video.
[01:39:42.357 --> 01:39:44.979]  Do you know about the activities within the Grove?
[01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:46.040]  Can you talk about that?
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:46.280]  No.
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.162]  Because I've never been there.
[01:39:49.162 --> 01:39:51.183]  All I know is that it's a bunch of elitists.
[01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:59.690]  And power brokers, who conduct secret meetings that take over the world, and they run around nude.
[01:39:59.690 --> 01:40:01.811]  It's all men, no women are allowed.
[01:40:01.811 --> 01:40:08.514]  And they run around, and you can find them going to the bathroom on the side of trees and so forth, and they have people come out and make speeches to them and all that.
[01:40:08.514 --> 01:40:21.140]  And I know it was started by members of the San Francisco Symphony, way, way, way back, who were shunned from San Francisco societies, and they formed their own little club there, up in Northern California.
[01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:30.686]  Where do you find these people?
[01:40:30.686 --> 01:40:32.669]  Have you ever heard of the Bohemian Grove?
[01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:34.392]  Oh, you haven't?
[01:40:34.392 --> 01:40:37.997]  He believes the Bohemian Grove is the CFR in the woods.
[01:40:39.432 --> 01:40:48.804]  The Bohemian Grove was started by members of the San Francisco Symphony, or some orchestra, way, way back, many, many, many years ago, shunned by San Francisco society.
[01:40:48.804 --> 01:40:50.105]  They have camps.
[01:40:50.105 --> 01:40:53.870]  It goes on for three or four weeks up in the Russian River area of Northern California.
[01:40:54.792 --> 01:40:57.956]  Uh, and there are members from all over the world and they can take guests.
[01:40:57.956 --> 01:41:00.159]  There are people that come out and speak to them.
[01:41:00.159 --> 01:41:01.421]  It's rustic living.
[01:41:01.421 --> 01:41:03.784]  Uh, it's, it's great food.
[01:41:03.784 --> 01:41:05.206]  It's great, it's great cooking.
[01:41:05.206 --> 01:41:11.395]  But, but, but people believe that it is nothing more than a secret meeting of world conspiracists.
[01:41:12.208 --> 01:41:14.651]  We're about to take over the world's money supply.
[01:41:28.687 --> 01:41:32.950]  Literally, Learjet's landing packed with high-dollar male prostitutes.
[01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.311]  And while I was in there in 2000, I looked pretty darn good.
[01:41:35.311 --> 01:41:35.992]  Don't today.
[01:41:35.992 --> 01:41:37.333]  It was a big joke.
[01:41:37.333 --> 01:41:40.835]  The employees were laughing at me and the guy I snuck in with, who were both pretty good looking.
[01:41:40.835 --> 01:41:43.076]  They thought we had old guys hitting on us.
[01:41:43.076 --> 01:41:48.020]  That was probably why we were able to sneak in past security and get the footage that thought we were male prostitutes.
[01:41:48.020 --> 01:41:50.121]  It's kind of embarrassing to have to say that, but it's the truth.
[01:41:50.121 --> 01:41:51.982]  The truth is the truth.
[01:41:51.982 --> 01:41:54.183]  Myself and John have worked with an employee at the Grove.
[01:41:54.183 --> 01:41:57.966]  We got new footage in 2005 of the effigy of a child that they burned.
[01:41:59.142 --> 01:42:04.404]  And the Grove, through several universities, including Berkeley, has released their own annals.
[01:42:04.404 --> 01:42:06.124]  And I own some of these.
[01:42:06.124 --> 01:42:06.825]  These are rare books.
[01:42:06.825 --> 01:42:09.485]  Some of them cost close to $1,000 apiece.
[01:42:09.485 --> 01:42:11.606]  These only put it out to limited members.
[01:42:11.606 --> 01:42:14.067]  And they admit they do rituals.
[01:42:14.067 --> 01:42:14.367]  Let me see.
[01:42:14.367 --> 01:42:15.807]  Helmut Schmidt, the German Chancellor.
[01:42:15.807 --> 01:42:17.548]  I have this in my film, The Order of Death.
[01:42:17.548 --> 01:42:19.088]  And Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:42:19.088 --> 01:42:20.969]  And his own autobiography, The German Chancellor.
[01:42:22.401 --> 01:42:30.346]  Well, we do rituals at our own druidic groves in Germany, but my favorite place to do rituals is in the United States, the Bohemian Grove.
[01:42:30.346 --> 01:42:37.990]  So this is real, this is happening, this is going on, and they admit they hatched the Manhattan Project for the A-bomb there, the Star Wars Project.
[01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:41.732]  They have bragged that they're setting policy and running things.
[01:42:41.732 --> 01:42:45.455]  And my mother called me when I got back from Northern California in 2000.
[01:42:45.455 --> 01:42:46.836]  She said, I was watching CNN.
[01:42:46.836 --> 01:42:48.136]  I later found the transcript.
[01:42:48.136 --> 01:42:51.379]  And they announced, hey, we know who Bush's VP running mate's going to be.
[01:42:51.379 --> 01:42:52.699]  It's going to be Dick Cheney.
[01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:54.761]  The decision was made by George Bush Sr.
[01:42:54.761 --> 01:42:58.924]  and Colin Powell advised Bush to appoint him there from that.
[01:42:58.924 --> 01:42:59.444]  John Connor?
[01:43:00.074 --> 01:43:05.578]  What's equally disturbing, aside from the satanic rituals, is the fact that they are setting policy in there.
[01:43:05.578 --> 01:43:11.603]  This isn't a Manhattan Project launched in the wings of the Pentagon, or in Congress, or in a private committee.
[01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:16.207]  They're doing this at this private resort when they claim that they're just having vacation.
[01:43:16.207 --> 01:43:23.492]  Also, Richard Nixon and his own personal private tapes, which you can now hear... And by the way, people always deny that Harper's really had that.
[01:43:23.492 --> 01:43:25.214]  They've now released his private tapes.
[01:43:25.214 --> 01:43:28.176]  Tell people what he said when we get back, then we'll take some final calls.
[01:43:28.812 --> 01:43:31.095]  This is so important.
[01:43:31.095 --> 01:43:33.958]  This is the mindset of the people running things.
[01:43:33.958 --> 01:43:36.501]  But, oh, they're Christian conservatives.
[01:43:36.501 --> 01:43:37.562]  Oh, they're so good!
[01:43:37.562 --> 01:43:40.085]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:43:40.085 --> 01:43:42.909]  Everything out there will be revealed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:42.909 --> 01:43:43.629]  InfoWars.com.
[01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:10.276]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[01:44:53.004 --> 01:44:54.785]  Hi Michelle, I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[01:44:54.785 --> 01:44:55.906]  Did they change your shift?
[01:44:55.906 --> 01:44:57.647]  No Lori, I finally quit my job.
[01:44:57.647 --> 01:44:59.068]  I'm working at home now and I love it.
[01:44:59.068 --> 01:45:02.611]  No more commuting and I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[01:45:02.611 --> 01:45:03.331]  Working at home?
[01:45:20.163 --> 01:45:21.063]  Doing what?
[01:45:21.063 --> 01:45:22.304]  It's a long story.
[01:45:22.304 --> 01:45:25.665]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:45:25.665 --> 01:45:30.928]  Oh, Michelle, you didn't fall for one of those internet deals, did you?
[01:45:30.928 --> 01:45:34.209]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real.
[01:45:34.209 --> 01:45:35.150]  Are you sure?
[01:45:35.150 --> 01:45:40.372]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[01:45:40.652 --> 01:45:41.192]  Really?
[01:45:41.192 --> 01:45:45.013]  I've joined the success team and their major advertising co-op.
[01:45:45.013 --> 01:45:49.735]  Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[01:45:49.735 --> 01:45:51.976]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[01:45:51.976 --> 01:45:53.296]  What was that website again?
[01:45:53.296 --> 01:45:56.017]  Earnmoneyathome123.com.
[01:45:56.017 --> 01:45:57.117]  Here, write it down.
[01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:58.058]  Good idea!
[01:45:58.058 --> 01:46:00.558]  Earnmoneyathome123.com.
[01:46:00.558 --> 01:46:02.579]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter too.
[01:46:02.579 --> 01:46:05.480]  Earnmoneyathome123.com is a global opportunity.
[01:46:07.654 --> 01:46:11.498]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?

[01:46:41.914 --> 01:46:42.314]  I don't know.
[01:47:08.894 --> 01:47:13.257]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[01:47:13.257 --> 01:47:16.619]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[01:47:16.619 --> 01:47:20.922]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with the building blocks for good health.
[01:47:20.922 --> 01:47:24.945]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[01:47:25.585 --> 01:47:31.147]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[01:47:31.147 --> 01:47:35.589]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery, and Jim said no.
[01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:40.331]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[01:47:40.331 --> 01:47:42.852]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.
[01:47:44.432 --> 01:47:46.433]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[01:47:46.433 --> 01:47:46.973]  877-817-9829.
[01:47:46.973 --> 01:47:54.577]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[01:47:54.577 --> 01:47:56.818]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[01:47:56.818 --> 01:47:57.118]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:47:57.118 --> 01:47:59.879]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[01:48:08.004 --> 01:48:12.589]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between.
[01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:13.550]  We've got you covered.
[01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:21.378]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:21.378 --> 01:48:23.300]  Raging for the truth.
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.642]  Exposing corruption.
[01:48:24.642 --> 01:48:29.006]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[01:48:29.006 --> 01:48:30.588]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:48:31.983 --> 01:48:35.025]  All right, final segment here on Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:48:35.025 --> 01:48:36.646]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:48:36.646 --> 01:48:41.228]  Gonna blitz through five or six final phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:48:41.228 --> 01:48:50.113]  We're finishing up with John Connors, syndicated radio talk show host, guerrilla information warfare specialist, getting the word out all over national TV and radio by calling into these shows.
[01:48:51.415 --> 01:48:55.822]  Uh, John, when you discovered this stuff was real, I mean, I know it's hard to deal with.
[01:48:55.822 --> 01:49:07.197]  The average person doesn't think like this, so we can't imagine that other people behave like this, but to understand how the world operates, we need to get inside their shoes, their minds, and then things make a lot more sense.
[01:49:07.197 --> 01:49:08.179]  They get off on evil.
[01:49:09.324 --> 01:49:09.804]  They do.
[01:49:09.804 --> 01:49:11.605]  Some people get off on skydiving.
[01:49:11.605 --> 01:49:14.466]  Some people get off on thrill rides, thrill-seeking.
[01:49:14.466 --> 01:49:17.607]  These people are so evil.
[01:49:17.607 --> 01:49:20.608]  They do get off on the evilest of evil.
[01:49:20.608 --> 01:49:30.292]  Richard Nixon, in his own tapes, I was saying before the break, said that the Bohemian Grove, which he has attended from time to time, was the most, excuse my language,
[01:49:30.842 --> 01:49:34.805]  The most faggoty, bleeping bleep he had ever seen.
[01:49:34.805 --> 01:49:36.126]  This is out of his own mouth.
[01:49:36.126 --> 01:49:38.669]  You can listen to the tapes right on the web.
[01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:46.575]  San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Cain, before he died of lung cancer, used to chronicle the homosexual activities.
[01:49:46.575 --> 01:49:59.786]  There was a man named Don Heinforth, who himself was a homosexual, who died of AIDS, who was the deep throat, so to speak, of the Bohemian Grove, who would report on the homosexual activity to the left-wing Bohemian Grove Action Network.
[01:50:00.362 --> 01:50:04.104]  And this is what they're doing while they're invading our privacy.
[01:50:04.104 --> 01:50:06.246]  They're tapping our phone calls.
[01:50:06.246 --> 01:50:07.786]  They are invading our privacy.
[01:50:07.786 --> 01:50:10.108]  So we're going to expose what they're doing in private.
[01:50:10.108 --> 01:50:11.909]  And we're not going to let it rest.
[01:50:11.909 --> 01:50:23.736]  And we're going to continue to phone mob and phone jam these mockingbirds and these gatekeepers like Sean Hannity, like Rush Limbaugh, and even Alan Combs, who will only cover half of the truth.
[01:50:24.972 --> 01:50:26.253]  Well, I know this.
[01:50:26.253 --> 01:50:26.933]  It's real.
[01:50:26.933 --> 01:50:27.894]  It's going on.
[01:50:27.894 --> 01:50:28.655]  It's happening.
[01:50:28.655 --> 01:50:34.779]  And I would challenge people to go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get the DVD, The Order of Death.
[01:50:34.779 --> 01:50:41.764]  It's about a 50-minute documentary I made with the two-hour Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove on the same DVD.
[01:50:41.764 --> 01:50:43.405]  The film I made in 2000.
[01:50:43.405 --> 01:50:45.407]  The film I made in 2006.
[01:50:45.407 --> 01:50:47.748]  New footage inside, shot by an employee.
[01:50:47.748 --> 01:50:49.449]  And by the way, The Grove's on national U.S.
[01:50:49.449 --> 01:50:49.930]  television.
[01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:51.452]  We're good to go.
[01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:18.106]  2,000 Hollywood stars, or 2,000 professional football players, all meeting at a place and running around having homosexual sex, or heterosexual sex, it wouldn't matter, and worshipping a 45-foot stone owl deity.
[01:51:18.106 --> 01:51:20.107]  You know, this would be a major news issue.
[01:51:20.107 --> 01:51:22.908]  This is a major news issue, and we cover it here.
[01:51:22.908 --> 01:51:25.369]  John Connor, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:51:25.369 --> 01:51:27.429]  The book is The Resistance Manifesto.
[01:51:27.429 --> 01:51:31.151]  The website is TheResistanceManifesto.com, or just Google John Connor.
[01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:35.013]  And no, we don't mean the one from Terminator, we mean the one from San Diego.
[01:51:35.013 --> 01:51:36.213]  Thanks for coming on with us, John.
[01:51:36.213 --> 01:51:37.894]  You gotta keep up the pride, brother.
[01:51:37.894 --> 01:51:38.294]  Thank you.
[01:51:38.294 --> 01:51:44.376]  Appreciate the time from John Connor on this Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:51:44.376 --> 01:51:47.658]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[01:51:47.658 --> 01:51:49.819]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:51:49.819 --> 01:51:53.400]  Let's talk to Todd in Corpus Christi.
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.881]  Todd, you're on the air.
[01:51:54.881 --> 01:51:55.981]  Welcome.
[01:51:55.981 --> 01:51:56.882]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:51:56.882 --> 01:51:59.303]  I just had a quick question talking about power brokers.
[01:52:00.217 --> 01:52:10.719]  Considering all the attention the Federal Reserve has gotten from America Freedom and Fascism, and considering a cost-benefit analysis, could we possibly see a false flag attack on the Federal Reserve?
[01:52:10.719 --> 01:52:22.402]  Well, the Federal Government clearly in 22 was involved bombing the New York Stock Exchange to cause a speculative run, which they then profited in the billions, and that was 22 money, not 2007 money.
[01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:24.982]  I don't know, but we know the dollar's plunging by design.
[01:52:24.982 --> 01:52:29.023]  We know that Alan Greenspan, also a Bohemian Grove member, that's a public photograph there,
[01:52:29.843 --> 01:52:32.844]  We know that he doubled the money supply in his last six years.
[01:52:32.844 --> 01:52:37.805]  Now, Bernanke, in the last 12 months, has said he's going to more than double it.
[01:52:37.805 --> 01:52:39.225]  And so, very, very serious.
[01:52:39.225 --> 01:52:46.347]  It is a private banking cartel that controls our Treasury Department and literally prints the money.
[01:52:46.347 --> 01:52:46.847]  Alright, yeah.
[01:52:46.847 --> 01:52:53.068]  If you think about it, I mean, if we had an attack there, you know, it could reflect on the sheeple how badly we need the Federal Reserve.
[01:52:53.599 --> 01:52:58.683]  Of course, it could also signal the complete breakdown of the economy that's already in the works.
[01:52:58.683 --> 01:53:01.765]  And it's all done by design to consolidate wealth.
[01:53:01.765 --> 01:53:05.188]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in North Carolina.
[01:53:05.188 --> 01:53:06.549]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:53:06.549 --> 01:53:07.269]  Thank you for holding.
[01:53:07.269 --> 01:53:09.651]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:09.651 --> 01:53:14.515]  I just want to go back to the President's State of the Union address.
[01:53:14.515 --> 01:53:21.980]  One of two points he made, one only got a lot of attention, which was the troop increase.
[01:53:23.208 --> 01:53:31.530]  You know, the first step we can take is... Yeah, the people want the troops out, so their answer is increase the troops, so we'll debate the increase and not the removal.
[01:53:31.530 --> 01:53:33.370]  It's a dog and pony show.
[01:53:33.370 --> 01:53:47.513]  But in that same statement, he says a second task we can take together is to design and establish a Volunteer Civilian Reserve Corps... Which is the National Compulsory Service Act that Republicans and Democrats are pushing.
[01:53:47.513 --> 01:53:49.894]  They're not going to call it a draft, it's called National Service.
[01:53:50.695 --> 01:53:56.798]  Exactly, there's a Washington Post article on it back in 2005, and it goes through and says, he says it right.
[01:53:56.798 --> 01:54:01.321]  Yeah, they're going to make you serve in the military or domestically, but they go, it's not a draft.
[01:54:01.321 --> 01:54:07.684]  I have Bush administration and Democratic officials as well on Fox News going, well, I'm not for a draft, but I'm for national service.
[01:54:07.684 --> 01:54:08.745]  It's the same thing.
[01:54:08.745 --> 01:54:14.388]  It's like saying, I'm not going to hit you in the head with a sledgehammer, I'm going to hit you in the head with a sledge.
[01:54:14.388 --> 01:54:16.609]  Or it's not global government, it's global governance.
[01:54:17.635 --> 01:54:19.499]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:54:19.499 --> 01:54:23.406]  Let's go ahead and talk to Emily in Ohio.
[01:54:23.406 --> 01:54:24.788]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:54:24.788 --> 01:54:25.649]  Welcome.
[01:54:25.649 --> 01:54:27.953]  Hey Alex, my mom called in and talked to you.
[01:54:27.953 --> 01:54:29.356]  She told me as soon as I got home.
[01:54:30.316 --> 01:54:33.298]  I heard about the vaccines, and I totally think that's terrible.
[01:54:33.298 --> 01:54:38.901]  Forced vaccine that's experimental, causing deaths, causing autoimmune responses, causing seizures.
[01:54:38.901 --> 01:54:41.963]  Even the CDC, federal government, says don't take it.
[01:54:41.963 --> 01:54:42.664]  Do they care?
[01:54:42.664 --> 01:54:42.844]  No.
[01:54:42.844 --> 01:54:51.689]  Rick Perry comes out and lies and says he signed an order making you take it, when all it is is a recommendation, and most of the papers don't tell you there's a waiver by law they've got to give you.
[01:54:51.689 --> 01:54:53.670]  But by law, you don't even have to sign that waiver.
[01:54:53.670 --> 01:54:54.911]  They just ask you to.
[01:54:54.911 --> 01:54:59.034]  Well, I told everyone at school about it, and in talking about school, I made a website
[01:54:59.778 --> 01:55:10.008]  It's called RiverviewInfoWarriors.4t.com and I was telling one of my teachers about it and they told me no one's going to want to do this.
[01:55:10.008 --> 01:55:12.530]  No one's up for this.
[01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:14.712]  The school could sue you for making a website.
[01:55:15.594 --> 01:55:17.656]  Having the name Riverview in the website.
[01:55:17.656 --> 01:55:24.521]  So now they're trying to threaten you to not have free speech here in the land of the free, the home of the brave.
[01:55:24.521 --> 01:55:26.843]  This is a live cancer virus.
[01:55:26.843 --> 01:55:32.067]  It is your right to start a website and warn your friends at the school not to take it.
[01:55:32.067 --> 01:55:32.927]  How dare them!
[01:55:32.927 --> 01:55:36.170]  But that shows how far we've come, how far we've been conditioned.
[01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:38.692]  Yeah.
[01:55:38.692 --> 01:55:42.655]  I've told everybody about it and I'm trying to get this group started so
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:45.662]  I'm still looking for a teacher and advisor.
[01:55:45.662 --> 01:55:46.882]  I mean... That's right.
[01:55:46.882 --> 01:55:47.643]  You called last week.
[01:55:47.643 --> 01:55:49.824]  They have to allow you to have a student group.
[01:55:49.824 --> 01:55:52.406]  Look, just start it outside school separately.
[01:55:52.406 --> 01:55:53.167]  Let them ban it.
[01:55:53.167 --> 01:55:54.507]  People will want to just join.
[01:55:54.507 --> 01:55:55.148]  That much more.
[01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:56.229]  Good to hear from you.
[01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:58.470]  Give us an update as this continues to develop.
[01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:06.715]  Right here in Austin, Texas, a 10-year-old at the Steiner Elementary, he went in there and during computer
[01:56:08.363 --> 01:56:08.623]  Cuckoo.
[01:56:08.623 --> 01:56:08.823]  Cuckoo.
[01:56:08.823 --> 01:56:09.223]  Cuckoo.
[01:56:09.223 --> 01:56:09.584]  Cuckoo.
[01:56:09.584 --> 01:56:09.724]  Cuckoo.
[01:56:38.946 --> 01:56:42.468]  So that's your big argument?
[01:56:42.468 --> 01:56:43.949]  Well listen, I'm going to give you 30 more seconds.
[01:56:43.949 --> 01:56:49.353]  Keep saying whatever you want.
[01:56:49.353 --> 01:56:54.216]  This guy held 37 minutes 38 seconds because the computer tells us to do this.
[01:56:54.216 --> 01:56:58.118]  This is your big intellectual rebuttal to me.
[01:56:58.118 --> 01:56:58.679]  He's gone.
[01:56:58.679 --> 01:57:05.403]  We got Joel in California and many others, but I'm called a conspiracy theorist for bringing up the North American Union.
[01:57:06.107 --> 01:57:12.911]  But Judicial Watch did a FOIA request and got the documents, and they're openly meeting and merging our governments right now.
[01:57:12.911 --> 01:57:16.233]  I mean, all admitted, Lou Dobbs is talking about it.
[01:57:16.233 --> 01:57:19.134]  It's admitted, you don't have to take this vaccine, it's a live cancer virus.
[01:57:19.134 --> 01:57:25.598]  CDC says don't take it, it's causing massive autoimmune responses, seizures, deaths, you name it.
[01:57:25.598 --> 01:57:33.122]  But Rick Perry's on the payroll of Merck, and so he just says, I'll just executive order and then claim you've got to do it, when it isn't even a law.
[01:57:33.122 --> 01:57:34.123]  So that's a fraud too!
[01:57:35.852 --> 01:57:36.873]  France tells U.S.
[01:57:36.873 --> 01:57:39.856]  to sign climate tax or face tax.
[01:57:39.856 --> 01:57:42.178]  The climate agreement is a global tax.
[01:57:42.178 --> 01:57:46.903]  So it says face the tax or we'll tax you through the EU on the American people.
[01:57:46.903 --> 01:57:49.385]  New York Times.
[01:57:49.385 --> 01:57:52.007]  I mean, what is it here?
[01:57:52.007 --> 01:57:55.511]  New York arrested five times as many people this year.
[01:57:56.483 --> 01:57:58.666]  As they did in years previous.
[01:57:58.666 --> 01:58:01.249]  They arrest you if you sit on the sidewalk when you're pregnant.
[01:58:01.249 --> 01:58:02.630]  They arrest you for any reason.
[01:58:02.630 --> 01:58:03.211]  Here's another one.
[01:58:03.211 --> 01:58:07.796]  In England, they're going to take your car the first time you use a cell phone in it.
[01:58:07.796 --> 01:58:09.538]  That's the London Evening Standard.
[01:58:09.538 --> 01:58:12.802]  Again, maximum penalties against things that aren't even illegal.
[01:58:12.802 --> 01:58:14.624]  Maximum penalties for things that are civil.
[01:58:16.118 --> 01:58:21.379]  The global corporations of the 100 biggest economies, 46 of them are corporations.
[01:58:21.379 --> 01:58:25.621]  They've come in, they've had a hostile takeover, just like corporations do to each other, of our government.
[01:58:25.621 --> 01:58:28.761]  They're using propaganda and PR to sell us on it.
[01:58:28.761 --> 01:58:32.042]  I'm sorry that Joel and others call me back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:58:32.042 --> 01:58:33.323]  Central Standard Time.
[01:58:33.323 --> 01:58:34.403]  Joel from California.
[01:58:34.403 --> 01:58:35.583]  Great job of the crew in there.
