[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:37.000]  I have been running around like a chicken with its head cut off since 5.30 in the morning.
[00:37.000 --> 00:47.000]  There's such a thing as over preparing. I have certainly done that and then I go to DrudgeReport.com
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  and we're posting the information up on infowords.com and I just knew it was coming next.
[00:55.000 --> 01:09.000]  And I've seen some changes over at Drudge the last month that were interesting and I even surmised here at the office.
[01:09.000 --> 01:17.000]  I said I think the deep state is going to try to target Matt Drudge and now they are.
[01:17.000 --> 01:31.000]  Did Trump bribe DrudgePull? That's one of the things the rat Cohen, who's been proving me a total liar, is now saying.
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  So this is all part of discrediting the election of Donald Trump.
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  And of course all of this is absolute crap. Anything coming out of Cohen's mouth you can't believe.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  But we're going to cover that coming up in the next segment.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  In fact, I forgot to get a copy of that article when I was in there reading it.
[01:45.000 --> 01:47.000]  Let me bring me one please.
[01:47.000 --> 02:00.000]  But you see, the reason I told some of the crew that I think they're probably trying to arrest Matt Drudge right now is see, they've been trying that with me.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  And I've not talked about it on air for several reasons. I'm a nice person.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  And there's about a 5% chance in one of these cases that it was not a attempted Mueller sting.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  Trying to set me up with Russian money that I of course refused and reported to the FBI immediately in letter and in other ways.
[02:19.000 --> 02:24.000]  And to the president and to top TV host.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  We'll have copies of all of it.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  And now I've got ABC News and others calling me up still going with the attempted setup.
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  It's like my God, you people are insane. You try to set me up repeatedly.
[02:39.000 --> 02:46.000]  And then you've got the nerve when obviously I don't have moron.
[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000]  And I'm Mr. Captain America.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  It's ridiculous. I'm not Cobra Commander or Destro folks.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  I'm Captain America.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  And I don't mean that arrogantly.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  Just if you want to use superhero labels or something, I'm not Cobra.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  Not the bad guy.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  No, good guys.
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.000]  That's why the evil globalist tell you all day that I'm the villain and Alex Jones doesn't believe what he says.
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  And oh, Alex Jones, this and that. And they block every body that tries to defend me on YouTube, Facebook, anywhere.
[03:23.000 --> 03:31.000]  And they just promote everyone attacking from the left, right, the fake conspiracy or conspiracy oids.
[03:31.000 --> 03:39.000]  All of them that Jones, Jones's banning was fake to promote him. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  It's really great for us to not have billions of viewers on YouTube, billions of views.
[03:44.000 --> 03:47.000]  Oh, it's really wonderful to have all these Soros lawsuits.
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  It's really wonderful to be fighting to keep the doors open. It's so staged.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  Just like Mueller trying to throw my ass in prison. No, that's really boy, I'm really in the deep state.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  Let me tell you, I guess I kind of am in the deep end.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.000]  I mean, I guess if you're getting raped, I guess you can still say, well, you know, you're having sex with them.
[04:08.000 --> 04:15.000]  Well, Mueller's trying to rape you. And so technically you're in the deep state because he's in you.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  I think that's kind of how you'd say it. So I guess technically I am in the deep state,
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  swallowed up by a big squid and dragged down to the bottom and dragged across the rocks.
[04:25.000 --> 04:32.000]  But I can hold my breath. So I guess I am in the deep state.
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  Swimmers out there in a great white shark bites your leg off. You're in the shark.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  You're not in league with it. You didn't like it biting your leg off, but technically I'm in the shark.
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.000]  Who knew I'm in the deep state. It swallowed me up.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  This is going to crap me out along with everybody's children. Oh, see, it's about them, isn't it?
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  We got a man up and do this, folks.
[04:51.000 --> 05:08.000]  So I'll be right back. Stay with us.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  That was pretty good, but hard to source. And the global has tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[05:25.000 --> 05:31.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[05:45.000 --> 05:53.000]  two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[05:57.000 --> 06:03.000]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[06:03.000 --> 06:22.000]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones show.
[06:22.000 --> 06:38.000]  So Rat Michael Cohen pled guilty to $15 million of unpaid taxes at a taxi cab company that had absolutely zero, zero, not a zip.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.000]  That means zero to do with the president.
[06:41.000 --> 06:47.000]  And now, two plus years later, and hundreds of millions of dollars spent on all these different fake investigations,
[06:47.000 --> 06:56.000]  there's the 30-something million on the fake Russia gate with Mueller, that's just them teeing up all their other fake investigations at that point here and a half ago.
[06:56.000 --> 07:12.000]  All this time later, and oh my goodness, Michael Cohen says he gave a bag of cash to some internet company to go promote Trump and drive up polls, online polls.
[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  Now, we know Hillary faked the polls at CNN.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  She has e-mails two years before she even ran saying, get it ready, buy off all the pollsters.
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  That's how it works in democratic politics.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  And it's in the WikiLeaks that they rigged the CNN debates.
[07:30.000 --> 07:31.000]  Remember those?
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  But that's not an issue.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  A political campaign rigging something with so-called media.
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.000]  No, no, no.
[07:37.000 --> 07:42.000]  Michael Cohen not wanting to get a longer present sentence.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  Michael Cohen is now saying, oh, there's no Russians.
[07:46.000 --> 08:00.000]  But to get a poll, to have an internet research, a marketing group, go click on something, and to drive up Donald Trump, I paid somebody.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  Oh, and then, oh, oh, oh, there's drudge involved.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Oh, oh, the president, he did it at the sole discretion.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  The president told him, go do this, bull corny hot dog.
[08:11.000 --> 08:17.000]  Bull corny hot dog.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  I'm introducing that into the modern vernacular.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  My dead friend, I doubt he was 33, went into the doctor, got an infection, died, Ryan Baxter.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  He wouldn't cuss when he was a little kid.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  I never heard anybody else say bull corny hot dog.
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.000]  But if something was really bad or whatever, he was cussing, he'd say, bull corny hot dog.
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  So I just introduced that here.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  I think he probably invented that.
[08:41.000 --> 08:42.000]  So there it is.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  Bull corny hot dog.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  So that's what we've got here.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  And that's where this goes.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  And look, drudge can do whatever drudge wants to do.
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000]  I admire drudge.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  He's a trailblazer.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  He likes to zig when people zag.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  He likes to put pressure like Ann Coulter's doing on Trump, trying to get him to do stuff.
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  I get that.
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  He knows a lot more than I do.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  He's been up at the White House a lot, really trying to help.
[09:05.000 --> 09:12.000]  But we've been seeing some decided anti-Trumpian stuff on there, more of a mix.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  And I've just been wondering what that was in the last month.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  And I said, boy, have they found a crooked toenail and they're threatening to throw, you know, drudge in the husk out.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  And I'm not saying that's what's happening.
[09:24.000 --> 09:33.000]  I just know that they gave up a long time ago trying to threaten me.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  Because I just can't make a deal with the devil.
[09:35.000 --> 09:37.000]  And I don't think Matt drudge has done that either.
[09:37.000 --> 09:48.000]  I'm just telling you right now, ladies and gentlemen, that this country is in a civil war with a bunch of anti-American globalists running around bullying and threatening everyone they can.
[09:48.000 --> 10:06.000]  Illegal groups without warrants are going through every prominent person's email, their phones, their bank accounts, their business records to try to find something so that they can leverage that and threaten the people that if you don't come out against Trump or you don't give us intel on Trump,
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  if you don't turn on Trump and this whole nationalism thing, we're going to destroy you.
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  That's what's happening, period.
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.000]  And almost all the men I know buckle.
[10:21.000 --> 10:23.000]  Paul Manafort didn't.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  Roger Stone hasn't.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  I haven't.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  And it's not that sometimes I don't want to buckle.
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  I can't buckle.
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  I just can't buckle.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  So that's what we've come to in this society.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  Because you know why I can't buckle?
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  Well, I can physically buckle.
[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  Sure one day my heart will buckle.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  And that's just ready to go to level two.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  I'm looking forward to it, but spirit is flesh isn't.
[11:01.000 --> 11:24.000]  But that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, where the Clintons can have uranium deals and sex trade and kidnap little kids out of Haiti, AP reports, and they can be involved with just absolutely legal servers and all these weird murders and billions in their foundation and illegal campaigning and hammers and acid wash and destroying SIM cards, total criminal,
[11:24.000 --> 11:33.000]  sconding obstruction of justice during live investigations carried out by their minions who are in a sick power cult.
[11:33.000 --> 11:42.000]  Not when you read the text messages, but when you're in DC and you're around these law firms and you're around these politicians, I mean they sick of fanically worship.
[11:42.000 --> 12:04.000]  Senators and congressmen and old FBI directors and there was an article about how I said a year ago that you know Cohen and all these other folks and trying to roll over to corrupt individuals like Mueller.
[12:04.000 --> 12:23.000]  See people like Mueller as an emperor, as a king, as his own branch of government above everyone because Lord Rosenstein, who's like God in heaven, you know, Mueller's just king of America, unelected, arrogant, runaway train,
[12:23.000 --> 12:37.000]  rogue government, but Rosenstein, I mean he's like God and just how they all shake and fear and grovel and kiss each other's asses, it is disgusting.
[12:37.000 --> 12:46.000]  You see I don't want to be in DC and be king of the swamp, I don't want to be in New York City and king of that swamp, I don't want to be in LA and be the king of hell.
[12:46.000 --> 13:06.000]  I just want you people to get off my back and my children's back, but you just can't do it. And I ran into some politicians, they're like Alex, I like to be confident, they're like Alex,
[13:06.000 --> 13:26.000]  heard you been saying Mueller, you know, king of America. Well, he kind of is, you know, and it's just all a runaway train of a bunch of criminals that have gone up there and hijacked our government and are just so stupid that big tech and the chai comms are running circles around them
[13:26.000 --> 13:40.000]  and running this country in the world of the ground and these guys are on express elevator to hell with their children on board, everybody else and they don't give a flying rat's behind.
[13:40.000 --> 13:50.000]  And I guess it's what happens where you folks that want to be the cool kids in school and they want to be the cool kids at college and they just all bunch of lying butt kissers that don't do a lick of work
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.000]  and then they get into government and what's a scumbag lawyer want? Oh, to have a badge and a gun.
[13:57.000 --> 14:10.000]  And so now you can have a badge and a gun and be this big tough guy and everybody's scared of you and you walk into Congress and everyone's like, oh, FBI agents, oh God, don't get me, oh please.
[14:10.000 --> 14:26.000]  I'm just a joke. These people are just jokes. They're embarrassing. They have presided over 9-11 in the cover-up, Mueller, the government narcotics trade that Trump's been trying to end.
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  I think they're so pissed. Trump got in and he said, we don't ship drugs in and we don't launder them anymore.
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  Well, third, I'm a 13 and the Mexican mafia will kill us if we don't. And he's just like, good, kill them.
[14:40.000 --> 14:46.000]  This is not our business. It's having junkies and human feces everywhere and high school kids on heroin. It stops.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  And by the way, we're not going to just feed troops into places so companies make money.
[14:50.000 --> 14:57.000]  He goes, you can all have super high tech space weapons and tanks and missiles and ships. You can all make your money, but it'll be where we're dominant.
[14:57.000 --> 15:05.000]  We don't just kill all our troops. They go, no, we don't want a bigger defense budget, but peace. We don't want peace through strength and a space force.
[15:05.000 --> 15:13.000]  We want to continue to torture people and fund radical Islamic groups and overthrow allies and put bad radical Muslims in.
[15:13.000 --> 15:21.000]  And Trump goes, you're a bunch of crazy people. You don't see the larger strategic plan of keeping the middle of the chess board destabilized.
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  You don't understand our grand strategy. Yeah, you understand your grand strategy, running the damn world on the ground. You're sacks of crap.
[15:28.000 --> 15:36.000]  You ever heard of straight shooting, you dumb pieces of crap? It's what built this country. You dishonorable chicken crap.
[15:36.000 --> 15:45.000]  Nobody's a bunch of filth. Somebody's got to call these people's bluff. That means I get smashed flat in a pancake. Good.
[15:45.000 --> 15:51.000]  At least somebody'll give you an example of that, like a damn man around here, said a bunch of knuckle dragon cowards.
[15:51.000 --> 16:17.000]  Everybody just shoot your mouth off about Trump all day. He's got a lot more courage than most of you can buy.
[16:17.000 --> 16:31.000]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth. I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't. It hit me when I was arrested.
[16:31.000 --> 16:54.000]  Get sober now. Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here. It's simple. Just call Elite Rehab Placement right now. Please, don't wait. Your life matters to us.
[16:54.000 --> 17:01.000]  Right now, before it's too late, 800-213-9264.
[17:24.000 --> 17:39.000]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:39.000 --> 17:49.000]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:49.000 --> 18:00.000]  Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[18:00.000 --> 18:17.000]  Info Wars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block. We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.000 --> 18:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.000 --> 18:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.000 --> 18:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.000 --> 19:08.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:24.000 --> 19:31.000]  It is a great formula that supports your heart, brain, and healthy aging process, with an all-new natural caffeine boost included.
[19:31.000 --> 19:37.000]  A powerful, pregnant-owned base, the Real Red Pill, will quickly become one of our fellow Info Wars' favorite products.
[19:37.000 --> 19:48.000]  Now, with an extra proprietary energy blend inside, including green tea extract and remonte leaf extract, and more, you can get that extra pick-me-up while supporting your mind and body in a healthy way.
[19:48.000 --> 19:57.000]  Got all the great stuff that Real Red Pill has? It's also got the most in it. Get the Real Red Pill Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[20:18.000 --> 20:38.000]  Earlier at the start of the broadcast, I made the joke that I'm in the deep state.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  I'm just going to talk about the control left and the control right. People learn real fast on YouTube and Facebook.
[20:43.000 --> 20:50.000]  If you want to sell your soul for a couple pieces of silver, you just say Alex Jones is bad, Alex Jones is a fed, Alex Jones works for the CIA, blah, blah, blah.
[20:50.000 --> 20:56.000]  I'm just totally asinine. I'm so proud of the fact that I'm organic, real, or let yourself build all this.
[20:56.000 --> 21:04.000]  But I made the joke it's like getting eaten by a great white shark. I mean, I guess you're inside the great white shark's belly.
[21:04.000 --> 21:18.000]  But where we really are is inside the globalist head, because I'm not that special. I just know that I'm not going to be involved with globalists that ship drugs into our countries and try to push them on kids,
[21:18.000 --> 21:29.000]  that push GMO in our children, tainted vaccines, secret medical experiments, funding al-Qaeda ISIS, massive UN child kidnapping rings, AP reports.
[21:29.000 --> 21:37.000]  And I see mainstream media always trying to cover up and defend the pedophilia. It's like, whoever this group is, I'm not with them. It's really that simple.
[21:37.000 --> 21:46.000]  So I am inside the deep state's head. And people ought to ask, why am I in their head so much? You know, there was an astounding Washington Post video.
[21:46.000 --> 21:52.000]  They wrote a big article about, titled, The Case for Banning Alex Jones.
[21:52.000 --> 21:59.000]  And this is what they're actually like when I'm in D.C., or I walk down the halls, and I'm not bragging about me.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  It's how pathetic they are and how it's the emperor's new clothes. I'm just like a two-year-old, three-year-old, the parable.
[22:04.000 --> 22:12.000]  No one wants to say the king's naked. They say only a lord can see, you know, this beautiful gold garments. He can't see it, so he doesn't want to say he can't see it.
[22:12.000 --> 22:21.000]  So everyone goes along with it. And finally, he's having a parade, and a three-year-old steps forward and says, the king is naked. The emperor is naked.
[22:21.000 --> 22:31.000]  And so they've got the weekly standard, the neocons. That's the really evil folks saying, ban me. You've got the Washington Post all saying it, putting videos out.
[22:31.000 --> 22:48.000]  And they're shaking in fear going, he's too effective. He's too convincing. We've got to eradicate him. And it's like, wow, they're literally saying, I'm the most dangerous man in the world to them because I have a conscience.
[22:48.000 --> 23:01.000]  And see, I'm reminding them of how bad they are. I mean, take Rand Paul. Take Rand Paul. Rand Paul came out and said, I'm really proud of President Trump, and I've met with him again privately.
[23:01.000 --> 23:18.000]  And he really intends to not spend the $100 billion a year, that's its average, on Afghanistan and the $40, $50 billion a year on Syria when we already made the agreement years ago that we would stabilize it and then pull out.
[23:18.000 --> 23:26.000]  And I'm so proud of him. Exactly. But does he get any credit for that? Does Trump get any credit? I'm not just defending Trump. I'm defending reality here.
[23:26.000 --> 23:41.000]  When he announces a new ground based interceptors in Alaska, radars, sensors to shield every city, to shoot ICBMs and other missiles down as they attempt to come back into the atmosphere.
[23:41.000 --> 23:48.000]  And by the way, that's jobs in America, and it's the defensive system, which we should be doing. And then all the defense contractors keep their jobs.
[23:48.000 --> 24:07.000]  We keep innovating new technologies from the defense sector that go into the civilian years, and our deterrent is better, pieced through strength, and we're not running around just having our military killed and on their 10th tour, 12th tour, 15th tour, 30th tour in some cases.
[24:07.000 --> 24:17.000]  Oh yes, that actually happens. No, we're not just over there with the crazy Islamists killing each other and then doing it to destabilize things.
[24:17.000 --> 24:29.000]  That's a good thing, shame, justice reform, so that a black person doesn't get the three times the sentence of a white person for the same drug.
[24:29.000 --> 24:38.000]  And crap like that, or if somebody's been in jail 20 years for a nonviolent crime or whatever, let them out so we can keep the violent people in.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  You don't see any praise from the so-called liberal black community. Nothing.
[24:43.000 --> 24:49.000]  We don't want missile shields. We don't want people that out of prison. We don't want a good economy.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  Like Bill Maher said, let's plunge this economy and teach them a lesson so the private fellow reserve did it.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  We don't want any of that. We don't care about Chinese distance being killed. We don't care about being surveilled despite on.
[24:59.000 --> 25:02.000]  We just want to get on the bandwagon with mainstream media.
[25:02.000 --> 25:10.000]  Like we're on this winning team to take down Trump, because after all, he said America first, and it's just so much fun, dude.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  Get on board with this because if you don't, people are mean to you.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.000]  Oh, that's right. Let's give in to bullies.
[25:20.000 --> 25:26.000]  Let's do what they say. Let's back down to them because that always works so well.
[25:26.000 --> 25:34.000]  And so when I said earlier, I can't break, that was not an arrogant statement.
[25:34.000 --> 25:47.000]  I can't sign on to a group of people that have no bottom. I can't sign on to people that are intimately obsessed with abusing children and killing them in a vampiric cult.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  I cannot be part of these people. I am not in their system.
[25:53.000 --> 26:09.000]  And you know, their system almost seduced me. I mean, I think when I was about 15, for all intents and purposes, I was a berserking Satanist.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  Okay.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  And I mean, I wasn't killing people or dogs or anything.
[26:15.000 --> 26:27.000]  But I'm sure as hell have sex with a devil-worshper woman. Let's just say I've seen a few things, okay? In one of the richest areas of the country where I grew up, I've seen the dark side of the moon.
[26:27.000 --> 26:39.000]  And I pulled out of being seduced by the devil by the time I was about 16, about 12 to 15, I was definitely there.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  And boy, it's a hell of a drug.
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  I know how the Satanists are into what they're into until you pull away from it and get contact with God.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  Because I was with God when I was little. I got partially seduced, but never gave over all the way and wouldn't do bad stuff.
[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  And then now I pulled away so far from the Satanism and so far away from these people.
[26:58.000 --> 27:08.000]  But that's why they can't stand me because they know I've been super far in the spiritual level, not all the crap and the rituals that they try to do to get where I got.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  It was not a good place I got to. It's not like I got some diploma.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  Let me just say I've seen a couple of things.
[27:17.000 --> 27:25.000]  And that's why they fear me because I've already been down the rabbit hole where Alistair Crowley went when I was 13.
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  I've already seen it.
[27:27.000 --> 27:33.000]  And now all these years later, all I want to do is make sure I get to be with God and my children do.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  And boy, I'd sure like to see your children get with God.
[27:35.000 --> 27:42.000]  Because let me tell you, the devil's real and he wants to destroy you and he wants to have you bound to him for eternity.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  And the best way to describe it is the Phantom Zone where they send General Zod.
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  That's exactly what it's like.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  And let me tell you something.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  The people that have the near-death experiences who die sometimes for 10, 15 minutes, who didn't have good lives and come back,
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  they describe what everybody sees on DMT who has the bad trips.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  And it's hell, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  And it's real.
[28:03.000 --> 28:10.000]  And there's a lot of stuff I haven't told you yet that I've made the decision before they assassinate me or take me off air, whatever they're planning.
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  I'm going to give you the full data dump now.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  I'm going to tell you how deep the rabbit hole goes and I'm going to break it all down.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  Because it's got to be done and you got to know that you better get right with Jesus Christ.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  And that doesn't mean most of these churches.
[28:26.000 --> 28:29.000]  And I don't just say this to be mean, it's true.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  Half the churches are actually run by Satanists. I mean, they're having Satanic rituals in the church at night.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  That's what Satanists do. It's a blasphemy thing.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  It's a religion.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  And another 30, 40% are just followers who want their 501c3 and want money.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  There's maybe 10% of the churches that have God's spirit in them. You need to know that.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  So that's what's going to turn you off.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  You're not going to find God in these churches.
[28:51.000 --> 28:59.000]  You're going to find it getting on your knees in the middle of the night and asking God to come into your heart in the name of Jesus Christ.
[29:21.000 --> 29:29.000]  The Deep State began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  A doctor's office visit for erectile dysfunction on my smartphone? That's crazy.

[32:24.000 --> 32:33.000]  For heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH, what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[32:33.000 --> 32:40.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.000 --> 32:49.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[32:49.000 --> 32:55.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.000 --> 33:20.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:25.000 --> 33:49.000]  There's a reason we're playing this song. Let's trade it down and try to pull up Teenage Frankenstein by Alice Cooper.
[33:49.000 --> 34:00.000]  Alright, let's get serious here. I got a lot of red meat for you. I got a lot of really crazy stuff to show and go over.
[34:00.000 --> 34:07.000]  But I don't want to go to it unless we really break down why it's important and what's behind it.
[34:07.000 --> 34:19.000]  So you remember the guy that looks like the original Frankenstein wearing a yellow wig? It's not a wig.
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  In California, if you misgender this bully, you go to jail.
[34:24.000 --> 34:36.000]  Well, the misgendering is saying that this six foot three bully, this big giant bully, this thug, is a woman.
[34:36.000 --> 34:53.000]  So we're going to get to this one because he's shown up on local television and they defend him like he is Mother Teresa.
[34:53.000 --> 35:07.000]  He's got a big thug, I mean, with big veins bulging out. I mean, you know, he looks like football players did kind of back in the 50s. They were still all white guys.
[35:07.000 --> 35:26.000]  The Browns. They probably squat 600. And there's some little guy behind the counter. This guy doesn't even look like a woman, but he is wearing pink shoes.
[35:26.000 --> 35:38.000]  I apologize, ma'am. And as soon as he submits, as soon as he submits and says ma'am and buys into the bullying, there he is.
[35:38.000 --> 35:45.000]  As soon as he does that, all the guys looks like Royd raging to me.
[35:45.000 --> 35:58.000]  Here comes Buzzsaw, last year's man champion, slicing enemies into quivering fleshballs. He's ready to take on the running man. I'm a woman.
[35:58.000 --> 36:06.000]  I'm a woman too. Alex Jones, I identify as a woman. Yeah.
[36:06.000 --> 36:17.000]  Excuse me. It's ma'am. It is ma'am. I can call the police if you'd like me to. You need to settle down. You need to settle down to mind your business. Okay. Ma'am, once again, ma'am.
[36:17.000 --> 36:29.000]  I said both of you. No, you said stop there. Stop there. Stop there. So you've got a raging lunatic in your store.
[36:29.000 --> 36:41.000]  Where people at checkout places, the video game place, their word, it's just like a convenience store of video games. Game stop. They're just like, boom, money, credit card, video game, boom, out the door.
[36:41.000 --> 36:50.000]  You can watch the whole video. The guy's just looking, okay, thank you, sir. And you know this guy does this all day because he wants to be outraged.
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  Hell, he might as well like police academy where the cops dress up like hookers.
[36:54.000 --> 36:59.000]  They're like, hey, Sergeant, you might want to shave your beard. Hell, grow a beard, bro.
[36:59.000 --> 37:04.000]  But see, for the TV interview, he puts some nice loop earrings on.
[37:04.000 --> 37:11.000]  And as you can't tell the difference between the way men and women dress now, let's see, this is this is this big six foot three, six foot four guy.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  He's got a little guy on the other side of the counter. Looks like he's about five, five.
[37:15.000 --> 37:23.000]  And he gets to threaten to assault him and kick over four different displays.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  And I got to say, I'm not saying this guy takes meth, but man, he's got meth mouth just like Alexander Cortez.
[37:30.000 --> 37:37.000]  So he and her ought to get together and we have some ugly little babies. Frankenstein meets meth mouth.
[37:37.000 --> 37:46.000]  So meth mouth the bully. What do you call him? You call him.
[37:46.000 --> 37:54.000]  Let me think of a good name for this guy. I'm trying to think of the right name here.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  What are we going to call this guy? Wild Bill on steroids.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  It rubs a lotion on its skin. Not my dog.
[38:07.000 --> 38:18.000]  South the lambs. I mean, because this guy could have a job in Hollywood as a creepy Frankenstein with a big square head, big teeth, big veins,
[38:18.000 --> 38:27.000]  walking around and bench press 500 freaking pounds, baby. I'm a woman.
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  I mean, he could probably get a job on one of these shows like Last Kingdom on Netflix where he's a Viking.
[38:33.000 --> 38:40.000]  He could be the next Viking villain on the next season of I'm serious.
[38:40.000 --> 38:50.000]  So you got a guy who could be cast as a Viking villain, but he gets to finally one up you and let you know you're bad for not buying into his CIA
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.000]  Tabistock created mental illness where he struts around screaming and yelling and freaking out at everyone.
[38:57.000 --> 39:03.000]  I miss gender him. Now it's I'm blind. I poured random eyes. Now I'm a dog and people walk there.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  People around dogs and people crap on the side of the street in San Francisco.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  They go, well, he is a dog.
[39:09.000 --> 39:16.000]  They have people doing that in Portland and the city councilwoman goes, well, we are Portland.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  It's so beautiful. It's like full grown men on the side right in front of you.
[39:20.000 --> 39:29.000]  They're like, beautiful. Let's bring the school children and show them how it's done.
[39:29.000 --> 39:38.000]  You ask, what is this? The globalist want to corrupt our minds for a very important reason because once they get you used to all this,
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  they can roll in the real carnage and the real control. This is an exact plan.
[39:43.000 --> 39:51.000]  I'll admit it, ugly architecture, ugly art, sexualizing children. It's all been declassified and now they're rolling it out, operational everywhere.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  And then we now have this clip I'm getting to of him on the news or it on the news.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  Frankenstein, Franken, Dr. Frankenstein.
[39:59.000 --> 40:10.000]  Oh, yeah, that was when I, if you're a TV viewer, that that's when I few years ago that I am now a able genders when you handicap yourself on purpose.
[40:10.000 --> 40:20.000]  They call that mental illness. But yeah, trans abled. But what do they call when you turn into another zoological abled trans species?
[40:20.000 --> 40:26.000]  So I'm going to start literally, I'm going to have my wife put a little chain around my neck and I'm going to wear some socks on my ears.
[40:26.000 --> 40:34.000]  I'm going to say I'm a basset hound and I'm going to have her lead me into PetSmart and we need him to get a full shampoo, nail trim,
[40:34.000 --> 40:43.000]  and we need his anal gland milk. And I will just, I'll come in like a dog on all fours and then I'll, and if they don't, if they don't,
[40:43.000 --> 40:50.000]  I'm sorry, this is, this is really happening. If they don't take me in the back and shampoo me and have the lady come over and, you know, milk the anal gland.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  That's what they do for dogs. Then they're, they're, they're bad because in England, I'm not joking.
[40:54.000 --> 41:05.000]  You get arrested or you get fired. If a man comes in with a beard and a huge, you know what, and says, you are going to check my cervix and a pap smear for cancer.
[41:05.000 --> 41:12.000]  And the nurse had to go on the middle of said, okay, but when she, but when she actually got his pants off, she said, sir, I can't do it.
[41:12.000 --> 41:19.000]  You don't have a cervix. That hospital was your ass is fired. Well, you know what, that's it. I'm going to PetSmart, PetCo.
[41:19.000 --> 41:25.000]  And I'm going to come in there as a dog and it's not sexual assault to tell a woman to milk my, you know what, gland.
[41:25.000 --> 41:37.000]  I'm just going to go in there and say, do it because I identify as a hound dog, a blood hound, pine nuts, macadamia nuts.
[41:37.000 --> 41:48.000]  You know, I joke about this, but it's not a joke. Making a nurse do a pap smear on a man's genitals when he doesn't have a cervix is master mental illness.
[41:48.000 --> 41:53.000]  But if they can get you to do it, hell, they're going to let you go to the next level, aren't they?
[41:53.000 --> 42:03.000]  They're going to let you put up with the fact that they are coming for your children.
[42:03.000 --> 42:09.000]  And now all suddenly it's the new thing at all the gay clubs. I guess they're not really gay clubs, are they?
[42:09.000 --> 42:22.000]  It's LGBT. We're up now. Now eight year olds are performing in lingerie, little boys dressed up like girls and talking about using drugs and ketamine and cocaine with convicted killers on screen.
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.000]  Oh, look at convicted killers here. An axe murder to have the child up.
[42:27.000 --> 42:33.000]  And now the children are posing in, quote, gay mags with naked men. Oh my God.
[42:33.000 --> 42:48.000]  But it's just art, you see. When we come back, it was K.O.B.'s, that's the name of the TV stations, job to put up the victim of the misgendered Frankenstein.

[47:21.000 --> 47:50.000]  So, in California, if you miss gender someone, it's what a $500 ticket, maybe even jail time.
[47:50.000 --> 48:00.000]  That's oppression. That's mental illness. That's CIA leftist tabistock plan where you're sterilizing little boys, telling them they're little girls.
[48:00.000 --> 48:07.000]  The Prozac isn't enough. You didn't give them enough vaccines to make them autistic so you make sure they don't reproduce by turning them into mental patients.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  And almost all the young children they've, quote, turned into trans children are autistic. That's even been admitted.
[48:12.000 --> 48:23.000]  So it's preying on mentally ill brain damaged children. Then you've just got people that want attention.
[48:23.000 --> 48:39.000]  You have Rachel Dolezal or whatever her name is and then that other fake black person, Sean King, who really looks like Errol Flynn, they want the status that they see that gives them in the media.
[48:39.000 --> 48:52.000]  And so she puts the bronzer on and frizzes her hair. Well, Mephenstein, or whatever you want to call him, Wild Bill on steroids.
[48:52.000 --> 49:01.000]  I mean, I don't know what you call this guy because no, I'm not mentally ill and I won't play along in your mentally ill games that the Tabistock Institute created.
[49:01.000 --> 49:10.000]  This guy probably is, there's no doubt he's mentally ill or he's just an attention seeker, but he comes off as mentally ill.
[49:10.000 --> 49:19.000]  GameStop transgender meme reemerges for interview with local news station claims aggressive behavior was justified due to malicious misgendering.
[49:19.000 --> 49:28.000]  Now, we're not even making fun of this. This is sick. This is obscene. This is state hospital on TV.
[49:28.000 --> 49:35.000]  This is what happened to the mental institutions. They got rid of them and they're not on the corner anymore talking to themselves.
[49:35.000 --> 49:47.000]  They're in stores attacking you. And as long as you say you misgendered me, you're allowed to attack people, kick things over, do whatever you want.
[49:47.000 --> 49:54.000]  And listen to this because this is the baby selfishness delusional temper tantrum.
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  I'll do it a hundred thousand a million times again. I loved it. It was good.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  It was good to fly off the handle. It was good to break a bunch of merchandise.
[50:03.000 --> 50:10.000]  It was good to scream and roar and yell at people when you look like he man from Castle Grayskull.
[50:10.000 --> 50:23.000]  He man and the masters of the universe. I have the power. He man and his power sword battle Skeletor.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  Think about that. Can we pull up masters of the universe?
[50:27.000 --> 50:36.000]  He man. This isn't funny though. We can make jokes all day. He's across between. I guess that's his name. That's it.
[50:36.000 --> 50:44.000]  He man Frankenstein. I don't know.
[50:44.000 --> 50:50.000]  So let's get to without further ado. I want a serious news to cover here. That's world changing, but I've got to have some relief here.
[50:50.000 --> 50:55.000]  But it's not really really physical. This is the real world that our children face. This is what we're being brainwashed with.
[50:55.000 --> 51:04.000]  We're supposed to accept some 63 NFL 64 linebacker coming and screaming and yelling at everyone because he looks like a brick.
[51:04.000 --> 51:12.000]  You know what house instead of a woman. And because we did to say, ma'am, we're bad people. We don't have our speech anymore.
[51:12.000 --> 51:18.000]  No, it's illegal to have the speech and say someone looks like a man when they're saying they're a woman.
[51:18.000 --> 51:28.000]  It's amazing. So let's go ahead and go to the local news with a straight face. This is a masterpiece in mind control.
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  Talking about how he's a victim and how he's not sorry at all.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  Excuse me. It's ma'am. It is ma'am.
[51:38.000 --> 51:48.000]  It's the video seen by millions. Tiffany Moore, a transgender woman who recently started her transition, yelling at an employee inside this Albuquerque GameStop.
[51:48.000 --> 51:56.000]  Moore says the cashier repeatedly called her sir instead of the gender pronoun she identifies with while she was trying to return a game she bought for her son.
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  Ma'am, once again, ma'am.
[51:58.000 --> 51:59.000]  I said both of you.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  No, you said sir. Once again it's ma'am.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  I said both of you guys.
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  Right beforehand you fucking said sir.
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  Sir?
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  Take it outside. You want to call me sir again? I will show you a fucking sir.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  I followed you.
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  I followed you ma'am.
[52:16.000 --> 52:23.000]  I was so angry at that point because literally five or six times he called me sir and got me so human angry and I was causing that.
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  The internet responding to the viral clip with memes like super ma'am, aqua ma'am, and macho ma'am, Tranny Sabich.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  Tranny is a slang term for transgender that many find offensive and derogatory.
[52:35.000 --> 52:39.000]  What's really sad is it's bringing so many bigots out of woodwork.
[52:39.000 --> 52:47.000]  But Moore, a local MC and rapper, isn't letting the memes get to her. She's using her newfound viral fame to raise awareness about the transgender.
[52:47.000 --> 52:54.000]  So is this a stunt when the person looks like Frankenstein on steroids?
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  But this is the world.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  No, the internet got in their face.
[52:59.000 --> 53:07.000]  The internet blew up in super ma'am's face and didn't buy it at all. But oh, the media, oh, it's such a beautiful moment.
[53:07.000 --> 53:15.000]  And they only show him kicking over one of the things, not four of them, and screaming and threatening Moore.
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  It's all edited where, oh, that's what you do.
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  Continue.
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  Long to get her message out there.
[53:22.000 --> 53:27.000]  We're humans just like you. We're people just like you. We have kids. We have kids.
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  Wake it up. We're just people just like you. We just come into your store.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  We're wearing pink shoes and a shirt.
[53:33.000 --> 53:41.000]  So you must be a woman and you start screaming and yelling at a clerk and being a total jerk as they grovel and apologize and beg.
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.000]  You're just a big fat bully who sits there and goes off the media.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  They sickeningly, like some alternate dimension of unintentional comedy with straight faces.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  Talk about what a regular decent good person.
[53:55.000 --> 54:01.000]  And then it's never announced to the parents, people like this go and have career day with your five-year-old daughter and son.
[54:01.000 --> 54:09.000]  A big, giant, right-head looking, not saying he's a right-head, man, goes and is going to meet with your kids without you knowing.
[54:09.000 --> 54:17.000]  And that's completely normal if this person approached you, this freak, and go, oh, don't call us a freak.
[54:17.000 --> 54:23.000]  No, no, he wants to be freakish. He wants you to think what the hell is this linebacker doing in drag?
[54:23.000 --> 54:29.000]  They're all a beard, like a lot of the fake transgenders do to freak everybody out. They're clowns.
[54:29.000 --> 54:37.000]  That's all this is, is creepy dudes have learned they can do whatever the hell they want with your kids in stores anywhere.
[54:37.000 --> 54:44.000]  I'm a woman and I'm going to beat everything up and I'm going to kick your store and everybody else will get arrested.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  But because I'm a man, you're not going to be mean to a lady, are you?
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  Kick you aside, you're mean to a lady, because nobody's going to be mean to little ladies and I'm a lady.
[54:55.000 --> 55:01.000]  You understand? He is, Johnny. I'm going to take good care of you, let me tell you.
[55:01.000 --> 55:07.000]  We better get him with our kids right now to teach us how to be tolerant.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  Let's go back to Frankenmeth. All right, here he is.
[55:11.000 --> 55:21.000]  We're going to take a long to get her message out there. We're humans just like you, we're people just like you. We have kids, we have parents, we have brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  We just kind of live.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  As for how more handled the situation inside the store with that expletive filled outburst.
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.000]  Yeah, I could have reacted a whole lot better, but you know what? I look back at it, if I could, I wouldn't change a single thing.
[55:36.000 --> 55:42.000]  I would do it 100,000 times again. I would check over that display 100,000 times again because my actions were justified.
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  I mean, it was it was blatant and malicious hate. It was blatant and malicious mis-generating.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  And we reached out to GameStop's corporate office for a statement we'll let you know when we hear back.
[55:52.000 --> 55:57.000]  Thank God, we better boycott GameStop right now.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  In fact, George Soros has a group he funds now called Free Press. I'm not kidding, it's a sick joke.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  They're everywhere saying no one should be allowed to even post an Alex Jones photo or talk about him.
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  And they're targeting fan pages for deletion right now.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  Running around vitriolically because they're for a free press.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  That's why I've got to be taken off the air immediately.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and play this little clip.
[56:23.000 --> 56:30.000]  We did find it. Here is this gentleman actually in a previous role.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  We don't have it because you told me you were going to have He-Man, Masters of the Universe.
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  Bigger than, I don't care. It's not a big deal. We don't ever, we don't ever need it.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  I don't care. It's not a big freak out. We're going to play that later though.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  You have the hair loops, the admiral and the water don't rise over Bear Creek.
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  But you know what the good news is here at the end of this segment, the really great news is I'm barely plugging this operation.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  I'm barely talking about the products. I'm barely talking about the t-shirts.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  I'm barely talking about water filtration, air filtration, m4store.com.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  Now, if I don't start talking about it, it won't be George Soros that shuts our ass down. It'll be me.
[57:01.000 --> 57:07.000]  So, I need your support. We've got products you need. Get to m4store.com today.

[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  Final run of Super Mill Vitality, not because it's not a best seller.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  It's our number one and number two. It's because we can't get the Wild Crab to herbs anymore.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  We should get a deal signed soon to try to relaunch the formula.
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.000]  But it's going to be six months a year. Who knows? Even if we're successful, it's all there.

[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  Are we going to let these globalists have their way with our children? No!

[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.000]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the sensors now.

[58:39.000 --> 58:43.000]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[58:43.000 --> 58:50.000]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, know that they can't food.
[58:54.000 --> 58:57.000]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[58:57.000 --> 59:00.000]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com.
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.000]  m4select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply.

[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  I got a head made of rock.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  I'm the kid on the block with my head made of rock
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  and I ain't got nobody
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  I'm the state of the art, got a brain, all a cart
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  I make the babies cry
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000]  I ain't one of the crowd, I ain't one of the guys
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  They just avoid me, they run and they hide
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  I'm a color surprise, I'm a asset to fight
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  I spent my whole life burning, turning
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  I'm a teenage Frankenstein
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  The local freak with the twisted mind
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  I'm a teenage Frankenstein
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  These ain't my answer, these legs ain't mine
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Got a stupid face, got some skulls in her face
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  This is video you're watching of your TV viewer.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  This scientist misgendered a woman
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  and so he deserved what he got.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  Can we put that, that's actual surveillance footage,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  black and white surveillance footage of what happened
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  when a scientist at a medical facility misgendered a woman
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  and she rightfully got angry and took action.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  So it's okay to assault people, smash things,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  any time, you don't like what they say.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  That's what the lefts taught us and I agree.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  You know, and I actually find the one that looks like
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  Frankenstein more attractive than the blonde over there.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  What was that actress's name?
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  I remember being a little kid, my dad thought she was cute
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  or my mom going, we were watching it.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  It's a movie theater and when we left, my mom was like,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  oh, David likes her.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Funny little, little stories from life.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  That is a really good movie.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  What's the name of that where it's a comedy about Frankenstein?
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  Young Frankenstein, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  But you can see what happens when you misgender.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  In fact, can we hear the audio from this?
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Can we cue this up and play this in a moment?
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  They start, oh, you don't attack the miss, miss.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  Look, they just attacked a woman for no reason.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  Let's back this up and show the brutal assault for TV viewers.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  If you're a radio listener, we're showing shocking black and white footage.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  We're a scientist.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  We mislabeled a woman and so Frankenstein began strangling him
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  and that's good because you heard the local newscast earlier.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  They said it's good to be violent attack people if they misgender you.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  Sounds like.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  Sounds like it.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Bad.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  Said.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Said.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Said.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  Said.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Second cinema.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Never heard of this.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  Now watch, here's the violence against the transgender.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  The transgender standing up for her rights has done nothing wrong here.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  These three racist white people.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  The transgender is also black as you can see, identifies as black.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  It's a black transgender, excuse me.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  Also trans abled.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  It doesn't have a brain, but that's okay.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  Disabled, trans abled.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  And so look at the violence.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Look at that.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Stabbing the transgender with Thorazine, which you would give a mentally ill person,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  but no, no, they're mentally ill to attack this wonderful person
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  and now simulated rape of the corpse.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Now necrophilia.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  I want to apologize to TV viewers, family audiences out there watching, showing you this.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  You know, this isn't really satire though.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  You just saw a Frankenstein looking character physically attack people, yell, scream, threaten,
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  you know, kick things over, do all this menace people physically, threaten to kick their ass,
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  which is a terrorist threat.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  The police were like, absolutely, called him, called him, sir, you're lucky you're not dead.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  In fact, he probably could have hung that guy.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  They'd be like, damn right, sir, good job, you killed him.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  I mean, oh, did I misgender him?
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  Maybe the clerk's not a man either.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Let's go to break though with By the Power of Grayskull.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  We'll be back, stay with us.

[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Who knew that he meant the master of Grayskull.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  I held him off my magic sword and said,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  By the Power of Grayskull.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Oh

[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500]  Condemned to hell
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.100]  The citadel tunnel worn to avenge
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:49.100]  Condemned to hell
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.700]  Have taken many lives. All right, so number that mastery rearing I
[01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:11.420]  Have the power
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.420]  I
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.420]  a six-foot-four
[01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:22.060]  Huge man will strut into a store and if you say, okay guys, I'll get you next
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.860]  You have
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:31.420]  Defiled me I will now threaten to physically assault you and kick over four things stomping and screaming
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:37.980]  And and harassing you a terrorist threats and the entire media will call me a victim because I
[01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.540]  Have the power
[01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:46.460]  The media said I am a man that says I'm a woman and you will kneel to the mental illness
[01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.820]  You will
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.740]  This is how a woman sounds
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:03.180]  How dare you speak to me in such a way?
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.860]  How dare you I?
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.500]  Have the power
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:13.220]  Okay, can we play that one more time? We'll tell us what we're talking about here. Go ahead and roll it first
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:15.220]  Let's hear the woman the NFL
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:18.060]  Oakland Raiders linebacker
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.340]  Come in
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:26.500]  Frankenstein meets he man meets Buffalo Bill and he's gonna tell you what you're now. He's on the news is a victim
[01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.860]  He's a victim here it is
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:33.860]  We're not doing ready. You're making my money back. Excuse me sir. There's a young man in here
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:39.340]  Excuse me. It's ma'am. It is ma'am. I can call the police if you'd like me to
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.100]  It is Frankenstein. You need to settle down and mind your business. Okay. Yes
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.100]  I pause
[01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:49.900]  There's like a man and a woman saying hey dude settle down. It's like hey watch your ass. I'll hand it to you punk
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.740]  I'm gonna tell you that's why I
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:59.660]  Would have gotten very upset at that point. I was like man you you're you're a huge dude in here threatening people shut up
[01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:00.500]  and
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.500]  Then if he touched me, you know
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.700]  It'll be on the news Alex Jones savagely beat a woman that's
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:10.460]  Five inches taller than him and outweighs him by 50 pounds
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.620]  It's like they have dudes
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:19.460]  Winning cycling competitions now they'll say no women will ever win again because dudes go like at the prize money
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:24.820]  Let's go. I'm a woman. They get pigtails or they've been they've been shaved their head. Yeah, I'm a woman
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:29.380]  Let me get now. I'm gonna get that $100 prize money. He did that. You know what I
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.060]  Think I'm gonna enroll in
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.140]  Some type of mental
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:41.220]  Especially mental illness. That's what it all is some type of middle-aged woman sport. I'm 45 now
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.020]  45 next month
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.620]  And I should literally just like get into hell. Why get into a woman sport?
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.620]  I'll just identify as Shay a
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:58.300]  Girl wrestler and I'll go back to high school. Oh
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:03.580]  My god, yeah, there's an example right there. These are dudes
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.860]  Dominating women and then we all go along with the mental illness and play along with it
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:20.940]  I mean you talk about using our hospitality to destroy our culture in our society Tidal 9. What do you whisper to my ear?
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:29.060]  No, yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, but I know what it is. I just you guys that's why so much. I've told the crew
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.860]  If they're gonna get on my ear, they'll just get on air
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:38.140]  Because that'd be so much more interesting if somebody just heard somebody say title nine sure
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:42.780]  I know that title nine is I just half the time you're whispering it and I don't hear it and just breaks when I'm doing
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:45.780]  Anyways, I'm not mad. I just constantly getting distracted here
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:55.300]  Those are the war drums
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:57.980]  Let me do this, you know, I kind of go off into
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:03.060]  Crazy town covering crazies and then we don't get to all the real meat and potatoes
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:06.460]  But really heavy stuff is important, but this is all heavy
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.100]  They're teaching us to accept mental illness and to go along with it
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.900]  Once we do that logic is suspended and we'll accept tyranny instead of liberty see to get us to accept tyranny and
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.100]  The globalist model and the end of the family we have to accept
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:25.020]  Insanity because we'd be insane to get rid of prosperity and freedom and justice and God for the devil
[01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:28.420]  In all that comes with that
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.420]  So that's why they've done this so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get serious here
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:35.780]  And I've played the clips now
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:40.060]  When I come back
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.060]  I'm going to get into the news
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.820]  Because there's a lot of it
[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:47.180]  It's very very serious
[01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:51.380]  And when we're busy laughing at the mental illness of the left's victims
[01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:56.060]  The globalists are moving to begin to arrest members the press
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.220]  Now remember
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:03.300]  That I said if they start trying to arrest Matt drudge
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.260]  That's a canary in the coal mine. I don't think
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:11.740]  It'd be a rocket scientist to know that but it's a major bellwether
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.260]  And
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:21.300]  So now the rat Cohen is trying to claim that Trump didn't win those polls on drugs report. No, no
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:25.100]  They paid internet research marketing groups
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:31.660]  To go push Trump, which is normal. They're trying to turn that it's about the illicit campaign finance issue
[01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:38.860]  So nothing notice. There's no Russia here. Oh, no. No, no unless you look at Mueller or Hillary or them
[01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:40.860]  Then there's just Russia Russia
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:42.740]  everywhere
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.300]  Because they'll spread the American people's legs remember they pimp us out
[01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:52.300]  They don't spread their legs they sell our secrets our money our future out Trump does it so he's ended the gravy train of
[01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.300]  the traders and
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:14:04.700]  So they're busy trying to now take him out and they want to take drudge out too obviously ahead of the big finale all these faking
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:13.260]  Investigations Atlantic Monthly's a globalist mouthpiece. It's saying it's time for impeachment. You know launch the impeachment
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:19.500]  So it's on and they're gonna take the economy. They're gonna take it all and they're gonna threaten and harass everybody
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.540]  Until they roll over and then when people roll over to them
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.380]  they're going to arrest them
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:32.660]  Because they they want to get rid of everybody that ever had any pull or any clout and
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:38.060]  That's where this country and that's where this world's going and it's a very very very very sad thing
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.300]  We're gonna go to break in a moment
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:44.060]  We're gonna come back and get into all of that and also tend to open the phones up to your view on the state of the country in the world
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:46.380]  But nobody said taking the country back
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.380]  would be easy
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:53.220]  But I have learned some very disturbing
[01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.060]  Things from some very influential people and
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:04.580]  Basically, I don't know anybody
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:13.260]  Other than me I guess and Rand Paul
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:19.100]  that is it basically cutting Trump loose and
[01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:24.140]  I think this is a major miscalculation

[01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:49.820]  All right ladies and gentlemen we're back live broadcasting worldwide
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:54.820]  I sit around with Gallows humor and laugh about what's happening
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:21:01.820]  But I don't laugh because I'm having fun
[01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:09.820]  But I've experienced the tactics that are used from every angle
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:14.820]  And the biggest thing they do is they threaten your wife, they threaten your kids
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:18.820]  They go after people associated with you so they'll put pressure on you
[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:22.820]  And they just keep doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it and doing it
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:29.820]  And then they'll send over somebody else to offer you money and oh this is a better path to do it
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:33.820]  And so it just seems like it's easier not to fight
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:44.820]  When in truth you're talking about a bunch of really spiritually dormant derelict, cowardly, stupid people
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:49.820]  I mean if you look at who they put at the top of the CIA and the FBI
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:54.820]  And they're incredibly compromised, small people
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.820]  And you read their text messages and things and you see it
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:03.820]  I mean this is what they traffic in, it's what they do
[01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:07.820]  And they sycophantically worship Hillary and worship Obama
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:11.820]  And you see the Jeff Bezos text messages that have been leaked
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:18.820]  Which is Trump striking back between his mistress and his ex-wife and all the rest of it
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:22.820]  And it's him bragging that he knows Bono who's a total nerd
[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:29.820]  When you get down to brass tacks, these are like weirdo peacocks that don't have anything inside them
[01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:35.820]  These are supposedly master controllers at the highest levels of power
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:42.820]  Richest man in the world, of course he's not, real wealth is hidden, $147 million
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:50.820]  And he didn't think he'd set up a CIA operation to wash the post and bring Trump down and that all his dirt wouldn't start coming out then
[01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:57.820]  And his company wouldn't get broken up and that his wife wouldn't be reached out to
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:04.820]  I mean Trump's making major moves but he's not fighting dirty until he gets hit
[01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:07.820]  And then he's just fighting back which isn't dirty at all
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:12.820]  But the establishment puts on this swagger when you see Mueller walk into a hearing or any of them
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.820]  Where they're just incredibly powerful
[01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:18.820]  And that may pick up a dumb chick at the bar
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.820]  But at the end of the day, it's all just pickup artists crap
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:26.820]  It's all bravada, it's all acts, it's not real
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:33.820]  It doesn't go out and plant the crops, it doesn't go out and take care of the cows, it doesn't get the chicken eggs, it doesn't work in the factory
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.820]  It doesn't put its boots on and go into combat, it's all a bunch of talk
[01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:45.820]  And it's all empty but you see this whole empty culture with all the threats of the deep state against everybody
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:50.820]  And most people have crap running down the sides of their legs just shaking in fear
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:56.820]  Oh don't audit me or don't take me out the year or don't, you know, like Joe Rogan
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.820]  It's cowardice
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:07.820]  And it's that collective cowardice of thugs like Robert Mueller
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:11.820]  That allows somebody like that, a monster like that
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:16.820]  To go around and do whatever he wants and intimidate everybody and get away with all this crap
[01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:20.820]  Because there aren't real men that are willing to stand up and it's not like I'm a real man or something
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:24.820]  It means I'm not signing on to evil, if I roll over to these guys
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:29.820]  I'm separated from God
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:37.820]  I can't join these people, there's not even a choice here
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:44.820]  These are bad people that all flock to these centers of evil like New York and LA and DC
[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:50.820]  We're just all these weak nobodies, all these cowards, all these yes men, all these social climbers
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:54.820]  People that never commit to anything and statistically they have the worst lives
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:58.820]  They have the worst husbands, the worst wives, the children almost all commit suicide
[01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:03.820]  I'm serious, like globalists, half their kids commit suicide
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:12.820]  Another 20-30% end up in mental institutions or drug addicts and maybe 10-15% become super alpha demons like they are
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:16.820]  That's not a very good track record, is it?
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:21.820]  And that's what I want to tell all the sell-outs right now
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.820]  And you know I was praying this morning at 4.30 in the morning when I woke up and I said
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:30.820]  God, what is the message to try to get the globalists who aren't totally evil to turn back
[01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:36.820]  And be like Saul on the road to Damascus becoming, you know, Saul of Tarsus becoming Paul
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:42.820]  Hit by the download, hit by the vision, it was just so big he fell off his horse
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.820]  I got hit by one this morning and I was hardly walking, I was like what's wrong, I can't even describe it
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:52.820]  You know the knowledge, the data, the connections, all of it, just the Eureka explosion moment
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:57.820]  That now I used to have like once a year and now it's like every day
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:26:03.820]  And God said, well that's a stupid question
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:07.820]  God through the ether
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.820]  Tell them that their children are going to die from the 5G and the GMO and that they already know it
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:16.820]  And they know they're sold out to evil and they think their children will escape
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.820]  It's not going to be God that destroys those children, it's going to be the parents
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:23.820]  Are going to slowly kill their children
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:30.820]  It's not going to be one in 58 with autism, it's going to be half the boys in about 15 years
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:33.820]  And they've got programs hitting the girls too
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:39.820]  Damn, we've hit the boys enough with the vaccines, let's tailor one for girls that destroys their fertility
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:48.820]  But also gives them autoimmune diseases in the uterus and in the ovaries
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:51.820]  And slowly kills them
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.820]  That's the fun torture
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:57.820]  Demons like that
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:01.820]  They like destroying something so beautiful and so powerful
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:04.820]  And then they're the guardians of it all, aren't they?
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:08.820]  How sweet pie it is
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:11.820]  Kill that unicorn
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:14.820]  Hunters of the unicorn, killers of innocence
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:18.820]  Killers of the children, killers of their potential, their future
[01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:23.820]  Oh, while they guard the earth and its future
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.820]  Oh, the earth's dying, they tell you, which is true
[01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:29.820]  They're the ones killing it
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:32.820]  And then the life-giving gas that would clean it
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:37.820]  They're going to restrict that, they're like, no, you don't have the carbon dioxide
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.820]  That gives us more oxygen in this part of the four pillars of the life cycle
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:46.820]  No, we won't genetically engineer and put up Wi-Fi everywhere, killing the insects
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:49.820]  And we'll see total insect collapse worldwide
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.820]  And then the collapse of the crops and the collapse of the ocean
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:54.820]  And the collapse of the four pillars
[01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:58.820]  And then the earth will fall and they will manage us through the fall
[01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.820]  The guardians with all the new plans to fix it
[01:28:01.820 --> 01:28:09.820]  But all the money in the world, Joe Rogan will save your children from your God Lucifer
[01:28:09.820 --> 01:28:12.820]  And maybe they're good to sell to it
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:18.820]  But I tell you now, all of you, particularly have sold out to this
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:23.820]  You will pay in your children, not by my hand, and I wish to harm upon them
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.820]  You will pay by your own deeds
[01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:30.820]  You will lose your children just as Pharaoh lost his
[01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:33.820]  You will pay
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.820]  Now, Alistair Crowley knew that, that's why he killed his own son
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:40.820]  And you people worship that fat, demonic slug
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:46.820]  So maybe, maybe then if you want to join your God and really prove you're a Satanist
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.820]  He did do what he did, I'm not saying do that
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:52.820]  But you might as well because you're killing them anyways
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.820]  You understand?
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:29.820]  You may need this herbal tea for relief right away

[01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:00.820]  We all know the importance of fish oils
[01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:02.820]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.820]  It's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too

[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:45.820]  This formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:50.820]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:57.820]  Try Honor Roll from InfowarsLife at InfowarsStore.com
[01:31:57.820 --> 01:32:03.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:08.820]  To find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:13.820]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:20.820]  It's made in the USA, it's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:23.820]  And it supports the Infowar, it is a classical 360 win
[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:27.820]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:33.820]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:38.820]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:43.820]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:48.820]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:50.820]  And to be healthy and as focused as you can be
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:53.820]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:57.820]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield at InfowarsLife.com
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:02.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:32.820]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:39.820]  So the total division of the nation and the world is going into absolute high gear
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:45.820]  The devil plans to wear out the saints until he gets full dominion over the planet
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:49.820]  But never fear, because the Calories coming
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:55.820]  Let me just show you some of the new articles up on Infowars.com and NewsWars.com
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:59.820]  And then I'm going to get more into the fact that Robert Mueller's fake net
[01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:03.820]  Via Michael Cohen the rat is now aimed at Matt Drudge
[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:07.820]  You knew that, it's aimed at me
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:09.820]  It's aimed at everybody
[01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:17.820]  And then again, everyone's supposed to crap themselves that the FBI's been taken over by rogue criminals at the top
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:19.820]  It's really sad
[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.820]  And because we then crap ourselves, they could win
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:25.820]  Because we don't get the danger is not standing up to them
[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.820]  That's what brings in the total tyranny
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:30.820]  Here's a new article that's got to go viral and it's so important
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:34.820]  It's on NewsWars.com, it's on Infowars.com
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.820]  It's on PrisonPlanet.com
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.820]  Now they censor you if you try to retweet or Facebook or YouTube
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:45.820]  Infowars articles, that's the corporate board of program people to block that
[01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.820]  But none of you retweet or Facebook or YouTube
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:50.820]  NewsWars or PrisonPlanet
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:52.820]  This article out, remember that
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:57.820]  University of Georgia lecturer says fighting white people is a skill
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:35:03.820]  And that's why he's for integration so you can beat up white people
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:10.820]  You know, McGreen was at the Texas Relays downtown a few years ago
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.820]  And that's a big, you know, dominated a black sport
[01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:18.820]  He ran the folks that were in high school with me, they were like, yeah
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:21.820]  Some black coaches, Alex was such a nice guy
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:27.820]  You know, black people would beat him up, attack him, and he just still had black friends
[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:31.820]  Well, that's because I'm like Martin Luther King, I judge people on who they are
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:36.820]  But anybody that's being honest with you, especially black folks, will tell you
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:40.820]  That some of the most racist people out there are black people
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:45.820]  And, you know, Hispanics are pretty racist against black people and they got a whole thing going on
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:49.820]  So this whole thing that's just black and white is crazy
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:56.820]  But I was smart as a young person but also kind of stupid and also kind of reckless
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:01.820]  So if I wanted to go over and see one of my black friends I played football with
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:11.820]  I would get my mom to drop me off in the black part of town, the town I lived in outside of Dallas
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:16.820]  And by the time I was about 11, 12, my mom, I guess was kind of politically correct then
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:19.820]  She was just from the 50s, she thought, oh, don't big deal, drop them off
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:22.820]  I mean, I'd have people come to the door saying, listen, you cracker son of a bitch
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.820]  I'll shoot your ass if I see you in this neighborhood
[01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:31.820]  Now, my parents just let me have those experiences, I'm not saying they're bad people
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:35.820]  Kids are a lot more sheltered now, maybe that's a bad thing
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:38.820]  But it's the point of people that work in this building
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:43.820]  30, 40 years later, people come up and say, man, Alex Jones was really a nice guy
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:48.820]  Because what happened was, I started having black people attack me in sixth grade
[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:53.820]  I started putting people in the hospital by eighth grade
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:36:58.820]  I started really hurting people by the time I was 15 and we moved to Austin to get away from it
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:00.820]  And my dad sold his dental offices, everything
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:04.820]  Plus I was caught up just in the wildest crap, it was just totally insane
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:14.820]  But the point is, I have experienced full grown black men out of high school
[01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:20.820]  Who've been out of prison, large black men, we're talking 6, 3, 6, 4
[01:37:20.820 --> 01:37:24.820]  Physically attack me at Sonics and things when I was 14 years old
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:26.820]  Because I'd put their little cousin in the hospital
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:28.820]  Well, your little cousin ran my head in the ground
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.820]  So of course I started punching him in the throat
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:33.820]  And I'm sorry they had to do a tracheotomy on him
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:35.820]  He attacked me!
[01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:37.820]  And by the way, it was the best thing ever happened to me
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:39.820]  I'm not a victim
[01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:42.820]  The look in people's eyes when they think they're going to hurt me
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:43.820]  And I started turning it loose on them
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:45.820]  And I started getting them on the ground and ramming
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:46.820]  They're heading the ground
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:48.820]  It was good times
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.820]  And then it was like, who's this little guy that thinks he's tough?
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:53.820]  I had to beat the hell out of the red naturally and started to fight with me
[01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:58.820]  But the point is, is that I was fighting for my life for the reason I could kick ass
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:03.820]  I'm not looking for fights, I don't want to fight
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:08.820]  But the average black person's never had a white person physically attack them
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.820]  I'll guarantee you, every white person I know that went to a school
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.820]  That was 20, 30, 40, 50% black, got attacked constantly
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:21.820]  And so I get to see this slimy racist dirt bag
[01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:26.820]  Why do you think most white kids in schools adopt fake black culture?
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:28.820]  Which they get beat up for now too, that's cool
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:34.820]  Because they're trying to not get their ass kicked
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:40.820]  You know, I was in high school when I was 15 and had four Mexicans
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:42.820]  Who had mustaches in high school
[01:38:42.820 --> 01:38:47.820]  They flunked so many times, break my leg
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:54.820]  All because I had talked to a girl that one of them had dated
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:57.820]  And they came to my house in the middle of the night and knocked the door
[01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:01.820]  And I came out and they attacked me right there in the parking lot
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:04.820]  And the first guy stood up and started attacking so I knocked his ass down
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.820]  And then I knocked another guy and then all of them jumped on me and stomped my leg
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:12.820]  Screaming, F-U Gringo, F-U Gringo
[01:39:12.820 --> 01:39:16.820]  And I got a pen in my leg to this day from it
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:26.820]  I broke my leg at the ankle
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:29.820]  There aren't Mexicans and black people, one out of a thousand
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:32.820]  Never had white people do jack crap to them
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:37.820]  The truth is America is Christian
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:41.820]  The truth is America is the place with England and others that tried to end slavery
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:44.820]  It's still going on in Africa
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:51.820]  The truth is half the murders, 54% of the murders in 2018 were committed by black men
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.820]  6.5% of the population
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.820]  And I'm not even demonizing, there's some nice black men in this country
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:59.820]  And good people that love this show and care about what's happening and go to church
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:04.820]  But the point is blacks have been maneuvered into this mindset and this idea
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.820]  Like the head of the new Black Panther Party says down in Houston
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.820]  Don't mug and kill in the black community, go do it to the cracker heads
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:16.820]  That's in the newspaper, I've had that guy on the show before, he defends it
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:21.820]  So now we've got professors saying, oh I love integrated schools
[01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:24.820]  Cause you can fight your ass and white people in there
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:28.820]  Yeah, little white kids with their book bag talk to hate themselves cause they're white
[01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:32.820]  And they go into school, they're a freshman, they live in a private school
[01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:35.820]  Oh, I am sorry, I'm white, shut up bitch, boom
[01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:36.820]  Boom
[01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:46.820]  You're not racist, sorry white girl, I'm a virgin, better spread your legs racist
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:53.820]  Just like big transgender, I'm transgender, I'll beat all your asses, bow down and kiss my ass right now
[01:40:58.820 --> 01:41:03.820]  But the look in people's eyes when you open a can of web-ass and they didn't expect it
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:05.820]  It's worth a lot, isn't it?
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:09.820]  Best thing ever happened to me
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.820]  Because that's what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:18.820]  That which does not kill you, only makes you stronger
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:22.820]  That which does not kill you, only makes you stronger
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:25.820]  The Nietzschean refrain
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:32.820]  So we'll talk more about this when we come back, but it's not just this dumb ass racist
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:37.820]  It's the whole left is literally creating total division
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:44.820]  Just like it's in the WikiLeaks, Hillary says we're losing and they said we suggest we expand culture war dramatically
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:49.820]  And that's every TV show, every movie, whites are evil, blacks are saints
[01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:56.820]  When Muslims kill or rape people, it's covered up, this is their system, this is what the system set up
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:01.820]  And it's up on infowars.com and white people, like it's a religious like mothers
[01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:05.820]  Give their sons riddle in the brain damage them and give them all the shots so they can't talk
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:12.820]  And parents, religiously, the schools cut, they're like, well, yeah, you know, the gang beats your kid to death, but it's okay, it's fun
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:17.820]  University of Georgia lecturer says fighting white people is a skill
[01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.820]  Yeah, I know, beating up marriage is a lot of fun, isn't it?
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.820]  You have to get used to fighting white people
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:29.820]  A philosophy lecturer at University of Georgia was accused of advocating racial violence after he tweeted
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:31.820]  Fighting white people is a skill
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:36.820]  Fighting white people is really a skill, really, it's one of, I have support of integrated schools
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:40.820]  You have to get used to fighting white people, it takes practice, tweeted
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:47.820]  Arame Quasib Fringpong, who is listed on the official University of Georgia website of the Department of Philosophy
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.820]  Fighting white people is a skill, and he goes on and talks about how great it is
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:55.820]  So this is the type of garbage we have the grand dragon teaching us
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:02.820]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom
[01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:07.820]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:09.820]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for
[01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:13.820]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:21.820]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:24.820]  You better understand that, because they're taking them right now
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:32.820]  We have seen what they want to do, they called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:37.820]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:39.820]  They want to pack everybody into the cities
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:44.820]  Because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:46.820]  It's The David Knight Show
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.820]  I never missed your show, any day
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:52.820]  And I mean, what? I mean, never
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:01.820]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.820]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:08.820]  That it lowers IQ, it literally dumbs the population down
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:12.820]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.820]  We've gone through two permutations
[01:44:15.820 --> 01:44:19.820]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source
[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.820]  And the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it
[01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:27.820]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2, that's been incredible
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:35.820]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine
[01:44:35.820 --> 01:44:41.820]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:49.820]  Two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:53.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:45:06.820]  X3, now available at m4slife.com
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:36.820]  InfoWarsLife's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients

[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:51.820]  But our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect

[01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:28.820]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:36.820]  I want to be troublesome and pesky, I want to keep going, I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:42.820]  I want to push all the way, I've committed to do that, I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:49.820]  But you've got a back-ish and I promise you this, I will never falter, I will never waver at a spiritual level
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:57.820]  I physically will, but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at infowarslife.com to give you my absolute total commitment
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:36.820]  So I talked about how the leader of the New Black Panther Party in Houston said go out and rob white people
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:39.820]  Don't rob folks in your own area
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:45.820]  But it's not just that, it's Dr. Bobby Wright
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:50.820]  Blacks kill blacks because they have never been trained to kill whites
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:56.820]  And that's what this lecture at the college is teaching people
[01:47:56.820 --> 01:48:01.820]  Irem Ozzie Frempong
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:04.820]  That's an infowars.com article right now
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:14.820]  University of Georgia lecturer says fighting white people is a skill, we need integration because then we can, well you see what he retweets
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:19.820]  Because we need to be trained to kill whites
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:36.820]  And that's being taught in college, you're going to pay what 10, 15, 20 thousand dollars a year to send your young person to learn that we need to kill the white devils
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:45.820]  You kind of get in the double cross here, right? Christians the West, Martin Luther King, let's all live together in peace, that's what works
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:53.820]  And the globalists then double back and train the minorities are trying to to do all this
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:57.820]  Yes, full tweet is fighting white people is a skill, really
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.820]  It's one reason I'm in support of integrated schools
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:08.820]  You have to get used to fighting white people, it takes practice, blacks kill blacks because they've never been trained to kill whites
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:16.820]  Well I don't know, if you're white you're 10 times more likely to be killed by a black person than the other way around
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:25.820]  And 54% of murders in the United States are committed by 6.5% black males
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:32.820]  And then this guy is teaching at the college and white kids are sitting there agreeing, yeah I'm right
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:38.820]  Now I'm just some nerd white kid walking down the street, please beat my brains out or shoot me, kill me, God, I'm so horrible
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:43.820]  Thank you for teaching me how bad I am, I want to kill myself now
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:46.820]  And you're like, well this is insane
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:51.820]  Yeah, local news is saying a 6 foot 3, 6 foot 4 guy built like a linebacker
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:58.820]  Looks like he-man is saying I'll kick your ass, kicking things over, threatening people with assault, terrorist threats
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:50:03.820]  And the news is like, oh my gosh, I played a last hour, what a poor baby
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:07.820]  Can you believe the victimhood he's gone through?
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:11.820]  It really is terrible
[01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:17.820]  But meanwhile you've got black people all over the world battling to get into the country
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:23.820]  Battling to get in because they know about all the opportunity and many of them get it and understand
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:29.820]  But it's liberal leftist race leaders like this guy
[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:37.820]  That imagine if David Duke, former Grand Wizard, said we need to kill black people
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:42.820]  He'd get arrested and it'd be a call to a terrorist threat
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:45.820]  And he should be arrested, but he didn't say that
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:49.820]  This guy did
[01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:51.820]  This guy did
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.820]  And he knows damn well
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:56.820]  Somebody kills your daughter, your son because they're white
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:51:00.820]  They're not even going to say who killed him in the newspaper
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:04.820]  Every time you lay, they won't say who the person is or show a picture, you know
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:08.820]  Same thing in Europe, it'll say German men raped and killed a girl, five-year-old girl
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:14.820]  You finally find out later, they'll arrest somebody on Facebook who went to the local court and found out it was a Muslim
[01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:20.820]  And they're a year, you don't tell them that, Germans raped that little girl
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:25.820]  After all, we've seen the TV commercials and everything where they teach us white men are the problem
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:31.820]  And that Gillette commercial in minute 45, every white person's bad, every black person's good
[01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:36.820]  And it's not the media trying to set black people up for some great future
[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:40.820]  They target blacks for extermination via abortion and all the rest of it
[01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:46.820]  Is they're just going to play us off against each other and are we so stupid we don't figure that out
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:51.820]  You think, I mean a lot of people say, well, you know, Jones, if they're trying to black people to kill the white people
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.820]  You know, they don't want abortion, but you know
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:59.820]  See how they trick us into going along with that and then we lose our soul
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:02.820]  Oh yeah, Wink Wink liberals will then let us kill the white people
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:06.820]  You're the ones trying to turn them into killers and say kill us all
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:10.820]  See how sick that is, the left, they are devils, man
[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:13.820]  You've got to understand the full import of this stuff
[01:52:13.820 --> 01:52:17.820]  They know what they're doing
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:24.820]  And you get a bunch of chip on the shoulder, arrogant, young people
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:30.820]  And you turn them into racists and the idea like, I remember hearing, is there such a thing as reverse racism?
[01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:37.820]  That's idiotic as if tribalism or racism isn't universal by groups and low IQ people or whatever
[01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:42.820]  If you're going to have a multicultural nation though, you've got to bind it by Christianity or something
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:46.820]  Like free market prosperity and a shared goal that that's all being removed
[01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:50.820]  And we're being told to fight and kill each other
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:58.820]  And you notice they had the New York Times writer, it was a big push to get Asians to hate white people
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:02.820]  They've got shows for little kids, you name it, where they teach people that whites are inherently bad
[01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:04.820]  We've played the clips here
[01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.820]  And the New York Times board member, she says she can't wait till whites are extinct
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.820]  She calls a subhuman, caved well in goblins, that's a quote
[01:53:11.820 --> 01:53:14.820]  She loves to be mean to white people
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:18.820]  And it's like, yes, oh, you love to be mean to white people
[01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:27.820]  She's more KKK than a grand wizard, bug-eyed cyclops or whatever you call it
[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:32.820]  They've got names like that, grand cyclops, dragons, wizards, Jesus, excuse me, Lord
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:39.820]  So humans organize themselves into gangs, it's what we do
[01:53:39.820 --> 01:53:42.820]  And part of it is because people used to only be organized into those
[01:53:42.820 --> 01:53:45.820]  If you didn't have a big gang and you weren't tribal, you could overrun
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:47.820]  But see, Christianity's been double-crossed
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:50.820]  Because Christianity tried to go out and get everybody to be peaceful
[01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:53.820]  And everywhere we had Christianity, even a basic form of it, we had prosperity
[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:56.820]  But that's all going out the window now
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:01.820]  And man, you've got a bunch of crazy, racist jerks
[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:06.820]  Like this guy teaching at that college
[01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:11.820]  Who says blacks need to start killing whites
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:14.820]  He tweeted
[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:20.820]  That's right, it's not that black people have gotten in the habit and the mode of killing each other
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.820]  It's not that that's wrong, dude, you should face that problem
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:26.820]  The problem is we're not killing white people
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:31.820]  So I can project on to this guy, whatever, you know, I want to think of him as having an high IQ
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:35.820]  But let's do a documentary, I'm shot, there goes the video of this guy
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:41.820]  I mean, this guy is a dumbass, stupid, racist pig
[01:54:41.820 --> 01:54:50.820]  And that's the type of evil that these universities are allowing in to prey on your money
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:53.820]  Just look at the arrogance of this guy
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.820]  And by the way, look how creepy and wimpy he is
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:58.820]  Because, and here's how this is going to work
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:01.820]  If you're in there for the money, it's not going to be good for black people
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:04.820]  If you're in there for the shine and the popularity, it's not going to be good for black people
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:08.820]  The only thing that might secure black people from...
[01:55:08.820 --> 01:55:10.820]  Yeah, notice, he sounds like a girl
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:14.820]  It's always some big wimp talking about who they're going to kill this and kill that
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.820]  Let me tell you something, you dumbass
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:22.820]  Don't think of it as your people, black people, they're getting their ass handed to them by the very same leftist, eugenicist, globalist
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:25.820]  That run Cold Springs Harbor that say you're not a person
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:32.820]  But you don't say a damn word about Margaret Sanger or the Cold Springs Harbor or Watson
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:35.820]  Who was there with Margaret Sanger, he's still alive at 90-something years old
[01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:38.820]  Because you don't get it, because you know what?
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:42.820]  You get a job to pump that racist crap
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:49.820]  You get a job to sit there and to set up white people to turn into total racists
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:56.820]  Because the real racists want to bully white people using you until they agree to pull the trigger
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:00.820]  And use bio weapons and wipe every last African off the earth
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.820]  They got the weapons, they're ready
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.820]  And then we lose ourselves
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:11.820]  But see, they intend to force white people into genocide
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.820]  And see, you don't actually want to save all the black babies getting aborted
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.820]  No, no, no, you'd lose your job in five minutes
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:19.820]  You just try to say, hey, don't abort your babies
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:22.820]  See, I'm the one not version signaling, buddy
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.820]  See, I'm version signaling to God
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.820]  Give up
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:30.820]  God doesn't want those babies killed no matter what color they are, you understand that?
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:32.820]  But you don't give a damn about those black babies
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:35.820]  You'll never hear a word out of scumbags like this guy
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:38.820]  You'll never hear one word about what's really going on
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:42.820]  No larger project, this guy is literally Hitler
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:46.820]  He's saying kill a group of people because the color of their skin
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:48.820]  He is a monster
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:50.820]  He is a clear and present danger
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:53.820]  He is calling for people to be killed
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:56.820]  He is teaching people to go out and be serial killers
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:59.820]  And kill people because of what color they are
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:02.820]  What type of transfer we under
[01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:05.820]  This man should be thrown out of the university
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:09.820]  Not because of his speech, but because of his calls to action
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.820]  You've got speech all day long to tell whatever lies you want, buddy
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:16.820]  But when you start teaching people, they need to go out and kill somebody
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:19.820]  Because of what color they are, that's just like Black Lives Matter
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:22.820]  Funded by Soros saying cops deserve to die
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:25.820]  Because of what some other cop might have done
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.820]  You're evil
[01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:31.820]  Let me tell you something, too, buddy, there's a hell
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:34.820]  You better get on your knees and repent
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.820]  You've got any idea of what the future is
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:40.820]  What a horrible, evil, snot-nosed piece of crap
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.820]  I'm gonna hope the phone's up covered, a ton of news straight ahead
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:44.820]  This is critical information, please tell everybody about the show

[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:25.820]  We've already changed the world together
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:29.820]  With our laser focus, do it again with hashtag Alex Jones
[01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:32.820]  On Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere
[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:35.820]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:40.820]  Hashtag Alex Jones, that's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment
[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:50.820]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit
[01:59:50.820 --> 02:00:14.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:43.820]  I'm going to finish up here talking about a real hitman
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:46.820]  In America, and there's a lot of them
[02:00:46.820 --> 02:00:50.820]  Because the green light has been put out there
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:54.820]  For white people, Asians, black folks, you name it
[02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:58.820]  To run around and say that whites are inherently evil
[02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:03.820]  And that just having any white blood at all
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:06.820]  That just means I say human
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:09.820]  That you then are the most evil, horrible person on earth
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:13.820]  And those people deserve to die
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:17.820]  And I remember like 15 years ago saying
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:21.820]  I don't like Sesame Street other than Cookie Monster
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.820]  Because I said it's all just creepy and it feels pedophilic
[02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:30.820]  And Elmo's voice sounds like a child molester would sound like
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:35.820]  And my wife, my current, my second wife, my real wife
[02:01:35.820 --> 02:01:37.820]  She doesn't like Elmo either
[02:01:37.820 --> 02:01:39.820]  There's just something about it
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:44.820]  Oh, it turned out that the main voice of it was a pedophile
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:46.820]  Now, I'm not saying this guy's a pedophile
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.820]  I'm just saying what is it about the voice of
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.820]  Oh, hi, how you doing?
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:55.820]  Oh, yeah, okay, it's fine
[02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:57.820]  So damn creepy, yeah
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:01:59.820]  Elmo puppeteer Kevin Klash resigned
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:04.820]  A second-man files lawsuit over new underage sex allegations
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:09.820]  Gee, people that want to be around kids
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:13.820]  Oh, hi, Elmo, take your pants off
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:18.820]  Hell now, Sesame Street gonna premiere at gay bars
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.820]  As long as you don't have the kids up there on the stage naked
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:22.820]  As long as it's in a gay bar, it's okay
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:25.820]  That's right, kids are now posing in gay magazines with naked men
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:28.820]  That's mainstream news, they're like, oh, hell yeah, of course we are
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:33.820]  I told you here in Austin, we sent a camera out there last year
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.820]  Don't, don't show it
[02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:42.820]  And it's a man with a flaccid genitals that are large
[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:46.820]  And doesn't look like a King David statue
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.820]  And, you know, grab warm with their moffsons, the opposite of that
[02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:55.820]  And the little kids being embraced by
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:58.820]  And man, that's what they call lesser magic
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.820]  Alistair Crowley was obsessed with pedophilias
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:03.820]  That got the most power of empirically other than killing kids
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:06.820]  And it's just you're sucking the energy off of them when you do that
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:10.820]  And then if you can do it out in the open, oh, that's the big bonanza
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:13.820]  That's, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:16.820]  And then we put up with it, what's coming next?
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:20.820]  People like Frankenstein stumbling around inside these facilities
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:25.820]  Screaming and yelling and being called victims or kids up there with naked men on stage
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:27.820]  What's coming next?
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:32.820]  Can we play some of the, some of the professor that says, uh, kill white people?
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:35.820]  My name is Armin Jose Frimpong and it's Friday
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:37.820]  That means you're getting your black politics today
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:42.820]  And it turns out the Hegel and the Aristotle show was very popular
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:45.820]  And I do teach philosophy and I teach philosophy for a few different reasons
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:51.820]  So today we're going to talk about Plato, Unity, the NAACP and black politics
[02:03:51.820 --> 02:03:53.820]  Because there's a reason I teach philosophy
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:58.820]  If you don't know philosophy is committed to the search for the truth
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.820]  And if you're not searching for the truth, you're not doing good stuff for black people
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:04.820]  Because, and here's how this is going to work
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:07.820]  If you're in there for the money, it's not going to be good for black people
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:11.820]  If you're in there for the shine and the popularity, it's not going to be good for black people
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:16.820]  The only thing that might secure black people freedom, it's not going to be gone necessarily
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.820]  But it might be the truth
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:21.820]  So we need to tell the truth about a situation
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:23.820]  Which is going to hurt a lot of feelings
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:27.820]  We need to kill white people, that's what he tweeted
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:30.820]  We need to teach black people how to kill white people
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:34.820]  Blacks kill blacks because they've never been trained to kill whites
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:39.820]  He's not just calling for murder, he wants organized genocide
[02:04:39.820 --> 02:04:42.820]  Okay buddy
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:47.820]  Well you might want to get your act together before you start a fight with people that are really damn good at everything
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:50.820]  And if white people are good at something, it's organized killing
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:52.820]  So, wouldn't want to do that
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:05:21.820]  I know, you're not going to listen
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:25.820]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:28.820]  Including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:33.820]  Aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function and more
[02:05:33.820 --> 02:05:37.820]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas
[02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:43.820]  We're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:46.820]  Paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:49.820]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:52.820]  Now available at InfowarsStore.com
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:37.820]  Alright, here's the score
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:39.820]  There's a lot to talk about
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:42.820]  You can see it
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:46.820]  Like right before Trump got inaugurated and then for about another six months
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:53.820]  Fox News other than Sean Hannity and a few others was decidedly against Trump
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:56.820]  Well, now there are more and more against Trump
[02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:59.820]  They put out the talking points to the globalists and don't really counter them
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:01.820]  Or they outright attack
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:07.820]  I know for a fact Sean Hannity is being threatened with being fired continually
[02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.820]  And I didn't get that from Sean, I got it from others very close to him
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:18.820]  And then other top people are basically fatalistic and say that Trump is going to be removed
[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:25.820]  Now in the battlefront, I don't necessarily buy that
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:33.820]  Just like with the stupid grab them by the, you know what, that was edited so what it was 12, 13, 14 years ago
[02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:38.820]  It was out of context, it's a private discussion like Elvis has women throwing himself on him
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:40.820]  He says you can do whatever you want
[02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:43.820]  You know when a woman is jumping on you, a little sign of a woman is ready when they jump on you
[02:07:43.820 --> 02:07:46.820]  With their legs around you and try to throw you on the bed of the couch
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:49.820]  It's kind of like, you know, that's what they do
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:52.820]  It's not very hard like when they're screaming, throwing their panties at you
[02:07:52.820 --> 02:07:55.820]  You know, if you're Elvis or whatever, that's what Trump was saying is
[02:07:55.820 --> 02:07:58.820]  When women are pulling their bras and panties off and throwing them at you and saying
[02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:02.820]  I want you, I want you, I want you, that means they want you and that's a great thing
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:05.820]  That's procreation, that's life, God gave us that
[02:08:05.820 --> 02:08:10.820]  It looks like he gave us sex and all this stuff, they all didn't give us anything but pain and suffering and failure
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:13.820]  God gave us all that good stuff, man
[02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.820]  Comprende?
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:18.820]  So
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:21.820]  Everybody was gonna bail on
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:25.820]  And I told people, I made some phone calls, a lot of folks, Roger Stone told the story and I said
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:27.820]  No, he's not going down
[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:29.820]  And we're not jumping ship
[02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:31.820]  And Roger wasn't ready for that, other people were
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:35.820]  I said, I don't care if we're tied to a failure, it's not happening
[02:08:35.820 --> 02:08:37.820]  Now
[02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:41.820]  Everybody's being death-threaded
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:44.820]  And other really nasty stuff's going on
[02:08:44.820 --> 02:08:49.820]  I mean, people jumping the wall at your house at night and, you know, banging on the door, stuff like that
[02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:55.820]  I mean, they're doing a lot of stuff and a lot of people haven't been in the fight that deep that long
[02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:59.820]  And so they don't get that if we don't hold the gates, we're gonna lose everything
[02:08:59.820 --> 02:09:04.820]  They think if they just give up and back off, when the gates get blown open and the borough comes
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:08.820]  Yeah, into the city, that somehow they're gonna hide out in an attic somewhere
[02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:11.820]  No, you're not, they're gonna eat you last
[02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:14.820]  And it's not gonna be pretty
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.820]  Because there's metaphysical rules
[02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:22.820]  And evil loves destroying cowardly minions the most
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:28.820]  And it's because historically God says, alright, you can kill the good guys when I allow it
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:31.820]  But it's gotta be pretty quick
[02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:35.820]  But God removes the hedge of protection from traitors
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:45.820]  So if you had any discernment out there, you would not be trying to serve this thing or curry favor with it
[02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:53.820]  And look, I'm not saying people that want to give up or want to back out are bad people
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:55.820]  If they fought, if they've been good, that's great
[02:09:55.820 --> 02:09:57.820]  But don't become traitors
[02:09:57.820 --> 02:10:00.820]  Don't try to join with the other side
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:04.820]  Because again, if we had two Boss Hog operations fight with each other
[02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:08.820]  Boss Hog wants prosperity, he just wants to skim out the top, he's bad
[02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:11.820]  He leads to more corruption later, like we're in now
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:16.820]  But I wouldn't be risking my life, as I've said a hundred times, and going all out 110%
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:25.820]  And just asking for it every day just to prove I've got, you know, big wavos, rancheros
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:30.820]  I'm doing it because I'm fighting for my life
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:33.820]  And I'm scared to death for the children
[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:35.820]  And I'm just scared for their souls
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:38.820]  You have to understand something, folks
[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:49.820]  This whole thing is about souls
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:52.820]  And it's beyond that
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:57.820]  What you think of as the soul is not what it is
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:04.820]  Some ethereal thing that
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:09.820]  Whisper out its knowledge, its integrity, its honor, its energy
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:16.820]  And its encoded DNA that is not the information, it is the receiver
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:25.820]  You have the genetic code of all your ancestors as a receiver from not just God
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:29.820]  But from them
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:31.820]  It's real
[02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:37.820]  And that's the theory that no one else has come up with because they're blinded
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:39.820]  But that knowledge is coming into the universe
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:44.820]  And the globalists want to take control of DNA and these systems to artificially control it
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:49.820]  And try to use it as a system of communication and control
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:51.820]  And it's not going to work
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:55.820]  You can't take something this elegant made in the mind of God
[02:11:55.820 --> 02:12:00.820]  And then even try to understand it when that's only one level of it
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:05.820]  It's like having a photo of a Bengal tiger versus having the Bengal tiger
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:08.820]  And that Bengal tiger is not just the Bengal tiger
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:12.820]  It's all the Bengal tigers before it and whatever that came from
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:18.820]  And the whole new age is set up as a fraud
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:23.820]  Because when you get closer to what this really is, it resembles what you think of as the new age
[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:26.820]  But it's not, it's God's plan
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:32.820]  And they're working around the clock to try to suppress it
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:35.820]  I mean, Burning Man
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:43.820]  100% run by cults that run our intelligence agencies
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:49.820]  And all these shows promoting DMT and all of this crap
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:57.820]  Are literally trying to get dumb idiots to get dialed into something extremely destructive
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:02.820]  So that they can be tricked and ensnared by all of this
[02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:05.820]  Thinking they're trendy and cool
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:08.820]  They're just creating a bunch of idiots
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:17.820]  Who have no idea how much trouble they're in or what they've been tied into
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:29.820]  And it's all done to make sure that you don't ever go to the next level
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:34.820]  So that they can shunt you off with some art projects and some bling
[02:13:34.820 --> 02:13:38.820]  And the Soviets would have all these big spaceships and industrialization
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:40.820]  And all the things they're going to do
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:48.820]  It's like Burning Man, you go there and there's all these old creepy admitted operatives from different intelligence agencies
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:57.820]  Going around trying to create subcults they can deploy into your local towns and cities to continue this
[02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:05.820]  And it's all Jack Parsons, Jet Propulsion Center, Alistair Crowley, crap
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:09.820]  Hollywood, all of it set up by these very same people
[02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:14.820]  And the whole thing, a giant fraud, a giant scam
[02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:18.820]  It's disgusting
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:23.820]  That doesn't mean if you've been to the Burning Man, you're a bad person, it doesn't mean any of that
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:28.820]  It means that they're telling you we're all atheists and you're an animal and you don't have any free will
[02:14:28.820 --> 02:14:34.820]  But if you come here, there's other dimensions and other universes and we communicate with these things that are our friends
[02:14:34.820 --> 02:14:39.820]  And these things are like the cockroaches of the universe
[02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:41.820]  But there's free will
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:49.820]  And so if cockroaches can trick us to destroy ourselves and build a system for the cockroaches to run
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:57.820]  When the cockroaches can't even build it, they just have been around longer than us and know we've built it before
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:15:04.820]  And so they come and go, there's another world and we'll help you, just we're your friends, but do what we say and here, oh, see how that worked

[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.820]  Everything's gonna be nice
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:13.820]  Now we do like to do things to children, but never mind that part

[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:29.820]  Don't look at me too closely, I'm humble, that's why I look like a blood-drinking cockroach
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:40.820]  See how these blood-drinking cockroaches, that is the spirit animal of George Soros, is a blood-drinking cockroach
[02:15:40.820 --> 02:15:49.820]  Actually, the entity that runs them is a large blood-drinking cockroach
[02:15:49.820 --> 02:16:11.820]  I laugh about it, it's all incredible

[02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:47.940]  trusted Keating crew supporter spam drudge report to rig online poll that just goes on
[02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:51.180]  in campaigns because you can't even control all the people you've got out there doing
[02:20:51.180 --> 02:20:57.580]  stuff with the super PACs and all of it but this is what they've come up with in Russiagate

[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:22.220]  you noticed Fox News is becoming more and more anti-Trump have you noticed that the
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:26.380]  whole campaign to impeach him being promoted everywhere is going into high gear they're
[02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:35.180]  trying to plunge the economy what should we the people do 877-789-2539 877-789 Alex
[02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:42.060]  now we can also get into this university professor saying kill all white people fight
[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:46.580]  all white people retweeting a guy saying you know blacks you stop killing each other and
[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:51.460]  start killing whites that's the sick garbage being put out that's on infowars.com and news
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:57.220]  wars.com that's all this censorship coming in now so people can't decry this and say
[02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:01.340]  it's wrong so this could just be put out by the universities and the media as if it's
[02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:08.460]  okay to create total division in this country this is the plan it's dangerous the average
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.900]  black person isn't like this the average white person isn't like this but it's going
[02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:18.220]  to create real paranoia and real fear and real clashes but that's what the globalists
[02:22:18.220 --> 02:22:23.660]  do while they enslave us and control us they find lots of useful idiots like this guy and
[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:27.260]  the New York Times board member who says whites are subhuman and can't wait until they're
[02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:31.180]  all dead and they're goblin creatures are like oh well you're Asian that's okay oh well
[02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:37.060]  you're black you can say and retweet blacks kill blacks because they never been trained
[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:46.780]  to kill whites I like integrations we can get our fighting white people skill up these
[02:22:46.780 --> 02:22:50.460]  are quotes ladies and gentlemen of your radio lester I'm showing the articles right now
[02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:54.460]  they're up on infowars.com and news wars.com this is disgusting and it's meant just like
[02:22:54.460 --> 02:22:59.140]  when the left tried when cops were getting killed a bunch they still are CNN MSNBC would
[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:03.500]  say well cops are bad they need to learn to go under the attorney general's control and
[02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:09.660]  strong cities initiative with the UN and you know become totally under our command or more
[02:23:09.660 --> 02:23:13.420]  cops are going to die the left thought if they went and killed a bunch of cops the cops
[02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:19.380]  would go okay we'll go under your leftist ideology most areas that didn't happen it's
[02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:22.100]  not the cops are perfect either but my god you don't want them in our globalist control
[02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:28.340]  believe me and so now they're just like hey whites we're going to start beating the hell
[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:32.540]  out of you everywhere even worse than we already are we're going to tell black people to go
[02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:37.180]  do it we're going to shoot cops everywhere and you better roll over and show us your
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:47.740]  pink little bellies and virtue signal really really really hard you know one of my family
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:54.300]  friends granddaughter I've known this lady for 43 years all my family friends granddaughter
[02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:59.460]  is quote by racial you know you know per black and she goes to a major university she just
[02:23:59.460 --> 02:24:05.140]  graduated from there and they were in the in the classes in journalism school she has
[02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:09.900]  a degree now and it was their final you know final exams coming up and they came in and
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:15.020]  said now we're going to learn about Alex Jones and fake news and how he's a racist and and
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:19.340]  this young lady's known me since she was born better than my house probably 50 times around
[02:24:19.340 --> 02:24:24.220]  the boat with his campouts and at first she was buying it all these years but it was already
[02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:27.620]  building where she was like telling her grandma you know they're trying to make us all racist
[02:24:27.620 --> 02:24:32.060]  and fight each other and finally that was it she blew up in class so this is total crap
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:40.660]  I know Alex Jones and the professor was basically like oh are you a racist too because that's
[02:24:40.660 --> 02:24:44.380]  the new thing it was like this Washington Post article had to admit that there's this
[02:24:44.380 --> 02:24:48.500]  black radio host debating a libtard and they go shut up with your white privilege not knowing
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:55.260]  the guy was black it's ridiculous it's insane yeah you can look at some rich white person
[02:24:55.260 --> 02:24:59.180]  say their privilege they're rich or it was given to them or some black person and say
[02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:03.780]  that but you don't just say of a whole group your whites you've got some privilege depends
[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:07.180]  on what street you go down or where you live or what you do I assure you there wasn't white
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:12.100]  privilege growing up in Dallas Texas with with with a large proportion of black people
[02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:23.300]  super crazy and super racist and super violent seeing an analyst they say that are Eva Martin
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:27.620]  accused radio host David Webb of white privilege I forgot to play that I'll play that next segment
[02:25:27.620 --> 02:25:33.660]  maybe right now we can queue it up of course Webb is black so that kind of train wrecked
[02:25:33.660 --> 02:25:40.020]  right there that's how that operation works and see everything's racial look at USA today
[02:25:40.020 --> 02:25:44.540]  the other thing is Mexico taking over America blunt you know and tying that to Spanish as
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:51.780]  if Mexico is Spanish speaking only that's a nationalist issue instead of like oh learn
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:56.700]  how to speak Spanish isn't that great oh Mexico take over America as they want nationalism
[02:25:56.700 --> 02:26:00.060]  in the groups coming in they don't want to melting pot it's all get along they want to
[02:26:00.060 --> 02:26:07.180]  keep them nationalist so they have no power in this country here's a clip of the black
[02:26:07.180 --> 02:26:12.980]  CNN race baiter that they get a script telling the black guy I'm not going to debate your
[02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:17.420]  facts I'm just going to call you white privilege here it is I've chosen to cross different
[02:26:17.420 --> 02:26:22.740]  parts of the media world done the work so that I'm qualified to be in each one I never
[02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:29.220]  considered my color the issue I considered my qualifications the issue well David you
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:35.300]  know that that's a whole another long conversation about white privilege of things that you have
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:40.660]  had the privilege of doing that people of color don't have the privilege of how do I have
[02:26:40.660 --> 02:26:45.940]  the privilege of white privilege David by virtue of being a white male you have white
[02:26:45.940 --> 02:26:50.260]  privilege with you hold on conversation I don't have time to get a riva I hate to break
[02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:57.340]  it to you but you should have been better prepped I'm black okay then I say you went
[02:26:57.340 --> 02:27:03.100]  to white privilege this is the falsehood in this you went immediately with an assumption
[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:08.780]  your people obviously or you didn't look you're talking to a black man they started out in
[02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:15.140]  rock radio in Boston who crossed the paths into hip hop rebuilding one of the greatest
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:21.460]  black stations in America and went on to work for Fox News where I'm told apparently black
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:26.660]  so I'm supposed to work but yet you come with this assumption and you go to white privilege
[02:27:26.660 --> 02:27:32.980]  that's actually insulting it is and I apologize because my people gave me wrong information
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:37.980]  they told me the whole white privilege thing is insulted can I can I apologize and correct
[02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:43.100]  the record I want to apologize I was given wrong information about you and I apologize
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:49.140]  so he's a black entrepreneur he's in all this stuff really successful in businesses and
[02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:54.340]  and he's bad because he's he's black according to race is black people because oh you're
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:57.660]  not supposed to you're not supposed to have a Fox News show you're not supposed to own
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:00.780]  a radio station or two you're not supposed to turn all these companies around you're
[02:28:00.780 --> 02:28:04.780]  not no no no you're supposed to be a loser and you're supposed to run around spewing
[02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:10.220]  a bunch of stuff that whites are all out to get you and believe me the average white person
[02:28:10.220 --> 02:28:16.860]  is a guilt-ridden nut job I mean do you think white people are sick of hearing about this
[02:28:16.860 --> 02:28:21.740]  you think white people are sick of being called racist all day but see what's happening a
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:26.940]  lot of white people is who weren't racist they're they're flipping I know so many left us now
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:31.940]  that are like that are racist people that were liberals who bought into it and then finally
[02:28:31.940 --> 02:28:35.660]  got beat up or something or and they're like okay well my god you're right and don't they
[02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:41.420]  go to the other extreme no Martin Luther King when he said it's true judge people on what
[02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:45.820]  they produce and what they do how do you judge a restaurant how good the food is how do you
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:48.620]  judge music how good it is I don't care if you're black or white how good's the music

[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:25.420]  rallying patriots worldwide
[02:33:29.660 --> 02:33:32.300]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:42.780]  but the united states needs is the rollout of more advanced weapons that are so dominant
[02:33:43.340 --> 02:33:47.660]  any arms races are ended but we need to then have a government that isn't using that for
[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:55.500]  globalist power and to start wars and destabilization so trump has announced anti-missile bases in
[02:33:55.500 --> 02:34:03.500]  alaska but also anti-missile systems in space which is a very very good thing well we'll go to
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:07.580]  that club and then get some of your phone calls after I cover one more piece of very disturbing
[02:34:07.580 --> 02:34:13.900]  news that believe me I don't take pleasure uh getting into it that must be seen but here's
[02:34:13.900 --> 02:34:19.180]  the president just a few hours ago
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:31.100]  space-based missile defense layer it's new technology it's ultimately going to be a very
[02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:41.500]  very big part of our defense and obviously of our offense the system will be monitored and
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:51.020]  and we will terminate any missile launches America has some catching up to do when it comes to our
[02:34:51.020 --> 02:34:58.060]  um geopolitical enemies right general jack keen yes what what's happened here dana 911 wars for
[02:34:58.060 --> 02:35:05.420]  17 18 years and sequestration for the last five years have really eroded the capabilities of
[02:35:05.420 --> 02:35:09.980]  united states meanwhile russia and china have been advancing their capabilities rather dramatically
[02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:15.980]  and particularly in long-range offensive missiles that they currently have cruise missiles and other
[02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:21.180]  kinds of missiles and secondly they're developing hypersonic missiles as we are but they are ahead
[02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:27.660]  of us in doing that so our missile defense have has atrophied in terms of us being able to protect
[02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:33.340]  ourselves against these technological advances that's absolutely true let's stop there at least
[02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:41.580]  with what they admit we've got here's here's the rest of the story it was the clinton's and others
[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:47.580]  that allowed the transfer with republican acquiescence illegally of all our missile secrets in the 90s to
[02:35:47.580 --> 02:35:52.140]  the chatcoms so they wouldn't even get their weapons off the ground if we hadn't transferred
[02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:58.460]  everything we had and it's it's high treason so every time we hear these big long preachy talks about
[02:35:58.460 --> 02:36:06.300]  how trump and russia remember they're now talking about did michael cohen pay a group to try to
[02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:14.540]  gain polls online and his drudge a crook i mean just totally made up bs so that's the rest of the
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:23.980]  story there now i'm gonna play one more video delving into the assault on men and that's really
[02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:33.980]  what this is pita is a cult set up by dr peter singer and it's a eugenics cult i know more
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:41.340]  about pita than anybody that's not inside it and by a weird twist of fate's the only reason i know
[02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:46.700]  this and i'm not going to get into how i know or the details but what i was told years ago by an
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:52.220]  intimate who was offered a major book deal all turned to come out true and i said this is too
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:37:01.020]  insane don't even go there but it's it's it's all allister crowley stuff okay and so that's what
[02:37:01.020 --> 02:37:09.740]  hollywood every time it just that's what it is and so when you see these ads that they air on tv
[02:37:09.740 --> 02:37:15.660]  and everywhere that target kids it's all meant to be extremely obscene and and and and disgusting
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:23.340]  because these are fallen people and some of the things they do are just ridiculous
[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:28.060]  and some of the other things they do are just outright evil and demonic
[02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:34.940]  but the leadership of pita has hamburgers and t-bone steaks on the top floor of their facility
[02:37:34.940 --> 02:37:39.180]  while everybody's down below they make the people go get dogs and cats from shelters
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:45.500]  and then the heads of it sit there injecting the puppies and cats killing them getting off
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:49.580]  on killing the little animals and that's just as high as the person i knew got in the cult
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:53.420]  and later they caught the pita person throwing all these dead animals away it was like a hundred
[02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:58.140]  of them or something in a trash bin that they'd had frozen that they'd been killing that week
[02:37:58.140 --> 02:38:03.820]  i mean it's full on killing animals while they eat hamburgers and uh the weird thing is they're
[02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:07.260]  all into farting on each other that was the other thing is that they all go around and fart
[02:38:07.260 --> 02:38:13.980]  each other's face and you understand i heard this and learned all this and then i got contacted by
[02:38:13.980 --> 02:38:20.460]  top publishers private detectives everything just because i had mentioned some of this without even
[02:38:20.460 --> 02:38:25.740]  saying who the person was because the person i knew had formerly under another name been one of the
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:31.260]  top people at pita and even when they were offered all this money to do the book i said this is too
[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:36.060]  insane they're the animal liberation front all those other stuff so you're like that doesn't
[02:38:36.060 --> 02:38:42.140]  make sense these are demons folks it doesn't make sense okay you have to understand the next level
[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:48.220]  of the demonic it's all about defiling being gross being sick being weird so for tv viewers you don't
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:53.340]  want children to watch this even though this has been shown to children and what's the real aim of
[02:38:53.340 --> 02:39:02.460]  this it shows men that look like complete absolute pervert child molesters and again they're glorified
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:07.340]  i'm not saying they're child molesters i'm saying if you were walking down the street and you saw a
[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:13.020]  guy that looked like that looked you you would say that is a homicidal maniac pervert that person
[02:39:13.020 --> 02:39:20.620]  should be swat teamed immediately and every one of them is a super creepy dude to show the image
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:26.940]  of a man being actually what the globalist push a fallen man a twisted man a weak man a sick man
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:33.740]  and helicoptering their genitals so they sickeningly have a rubber fruit that actually looks like giant
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:42.940]  genitals being swung pervertedly at you and the real message is manner trash manner garbage
[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:50.220]  manner filth and they hide it in a donate meat message you go back to the leftist controlled
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:55.100]  cia in the 60s and 50s has been declassified ugly architecture break up the family make
[02:39:55.100 --> 02:40:01.260]  people used to seeing uglyness and evil so this is that ooh men are gross like all the other ads
[02:40:01.260 --> 02:40:05.900]  all the men are stupid all the men are dumb don't listen to men now women don't listen to men they
[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:13.020]  and the men don't act like men you listen to the state so now all of these things masculinity's toxic
[02:40:13.020 --> 02:40:17.740]  blah blah blah and now women know masculinity is not toxic it's good just like femininity is good
[02:40:18.380 --> 02:40:24.220]  it all comes together that unity so they show you a traditional male as a guy in a pervert
[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:32.380]  wife beater with what looks like grotesque demon genitals but it's okay for tv this is airing on
[02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:39.420]  tv and all the channels are picking it up because it's rubber just like you're teaching children
[02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:44.460]  ages five six seven how to insert giant dildos in themselves and i'm sorry to talk like that it's
[02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:50.780]  what's going on this is huffington post this is msnbc this is all the publications teaching you
[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:55.580]  pedophilia is good so uh this is hard to watch i've only watched it once i'm gonna watch it again
[02:40:56.300 --> 02:41:02.220]  but look into the eyes of them pushing they're telling you who they are they're coming for
[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:20.620]  everybody here it is no sir white men
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:31.820]  businessman that guy looks just like uh jimmy savelia back it up
[02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:38.780]  they picked jimmy savelia the famous pedophile and then oh here's a guy that works in a car wash
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:51.100]  he's bad he's got a job so this is just pervert pedophile hollywood telling you who they are
[02:41:51.100 --> 02:42:00.380]  and a guy dancing with a girl is rape and then they put a black genitals on the statue of david
[02:42:00.380 --> 02:42:11.740]  and the girls look don't like him increase your sexual stamina go vegan pita has nothing to do
[02:42:11.740 --> 02:42:18.940]  with that the whole thing is a filthy sick evil eugenics operation we're going to break right back

[02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:26.780]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought ux2 that's been incredible now due to the
[02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:32.140]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:37.660]  of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it
[02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:44.780]  with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it super charges it and makes it even more

[02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:32.380]  now listen a lot of you are probably noticing right now that i've not even talked about the
[02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:38.540]  fact one of the top stories in the country is ban alex jones and i got a really interesting text
[02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:43.020]  in the middle of the night from a very famous talk show how saying the irony and it was a tweet
[02:47:44.060 --> 02:47:52.620]  that uh said free press and it's a soros group publicly and then it says we must ban alex jones
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:59.420]  completely off facebook well i can tell them that two of those three aren't even our facebook
[02:47:59.420 --> 02:48:03.580]  i don't know how all that works but facebook has those pages we've talked to two people to have it
[02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:08.300]  shadow band we're hardly anything we can be promoted less than one percent of our traffic
[02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:15.020]  to info wars dot com now comes from facebook the shadow band is like two years ago so they're
[02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:22.140]  having this whole rigamarole about get us off facebook and really it's about collecting emails
[02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:25.340]  to build a lynch mob to go out for tucker carlson and shan hanity and others
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:31.020]  so they turned me into this unlikable creature to the left then they used me as a fundraiser
[02:48:32.380 --> 02:48:36.220]  and as this straw man creature to attack everybody else and i talked to some of these national folks
[02:48:36.860 --> 02:48:40.060]  last night this morning and they totally agree with me that that that that's what's going on
[02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:48.780]  and it's just so i haven't really talked about it today uh because you you know look
[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:52.940]  the listeners are either going to tell their friends or family their neighbors their email
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:57.740]  their their whatever about info wars and about news wars and who we are or you're not i mean if
[02:48:57.740 --> 02:49:01.020]  you don't see they want to shut us down and you don't promote it you don't tell folks about your
[02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:05.020]  local stations then we're going to lose you got to get obnoxious you got to get repetitive you
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:08.540]  got to get aggressive what you've been doing and i want to thank you all but
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:14.780]  i haven't even already plugged the last two days and almost no money's coming in to fund
[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:20.220]  our operation and you know and i just feel like the information is so heavy that if people don't
[02:49:20.220 --> 02:49:24.060]  want to go to info wars store dot com and get the great products there and get the great discounts
[02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:29.100]  then fine don't it's really your choice i'm going to cover information and news even more
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:33.580]  and try to not just sit here and plug all day because the time is so the essence and i think
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:40.060]  the audience is smart enough to get that one of the smartest your smartest groups out there and
[02:49:40.060 --> 02:49:45.820]  then that's just what my gut tells me to do but we do need your support and a lot of big
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:49.100]  specials going right now and without you we won't be here but uh
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:56.860]  you know it's it's just surreal to have george soros publicly funding a group
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:50:00.460]  called free press in fact guys can you pull the article up it's an information liberation
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:05.340]  article dot com here is ever out here actually stood over at the head shop please
[02:50:05.340 --> 02:50:09.980]  then i'll give the calls now let's a little bit the next hour to all these calls i don't
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:14.540]  bet brackets coming up free press petitions for alex jones will be banned permanently
[02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:23.100]  from facebook and the group's called free press run by george soros and they just say hateful
[02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:27.900]  conspiracy theorist alex jones is back on facebook they don't even give excuses now they just say
[02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:34.220]  he's back whack them all just a few months after the site kicked him off urge facebook to ban him
[02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:40.620]  permanently facebook as bad as they are was the most judicious about all this with their fakeness
[02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:46.860]  they at least did some pretense they said well we did find some transphobic things you know
[02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:51.900]  saying five-year-olds shouldn't be taught how to wear dresses at school we did find some of that so
[02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:57.900]  your band off these two pages like just like those pages and then there's the personal alex
[02:50:57.900 --> 02:51:04.220]  jones page that's shadow band it doesn't really do anything and then there is some other sites that
[02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:09.420]  there's some fan sites they're always like there's a fan site you can't have a people promoting it
[02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:15.660]  get him down we're liberals we're the free press and and and you say that doesn't make sense
[02:51:16.700 --> 02:51:20.540]  that this group soros is finding and getting everybody banned and organizing lynch mobs
[02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:24.940]  outrage mobs is called free press when they're anti-free press that's the point
[02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:32.140]  of having men dress up like a bunch of pedophiles all white men dress up like famous pedophiles
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:39.660]  and that huge giant rubber you know what's hanging down and that's a proper to put on the news
[02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:45.180]  let's see a 1984 land when i talk about it it's bad
[02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:51.980]  like i'm singing and they can all cuss all day long if we let a cuss word slip through
[02:51:51.980 --> 02:52:03.180]  oh my gosh FCC investigations but don't worry at free press that's the that's the sick name it's like
[02:52:04.220 --> 02:52:08.460]  the committee for child safety you know hypothetical name and then it's a nambla
[02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:16.620]  the north american man boy love association and i obsess on that because when you get down to brass
[02:52:16.620 --> 02:52:22.780]  packs the vatican the uk government pin all these big institutions are run by pedophiles
[02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:32.860]  they're all weird soft pasty weirdos that are so demon controlled all they want to do is ruin
[02:52:32.860 --> 02:52:39.020]  your son or daughter's future by stealing their innocence and then invoking them into the cult
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:45.980]  and getting them to bring them more children and then they tell them well you've been involved now
[02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:53.820]  oh we're putting zuckerberg on screen i'm not saying there's any evidence that zuckerberg
[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:58.060]  should exit the pedophilia we never found that it's netflix it's like the pedophile channel
[02:52:58.060 --> 02:53:01.420]  now they have like five shows out about how pedophiles are good and
[02:53:01.420 --> 02:53:07.900]  like i said folks they're coming for your children what are you gonna do
[02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:13.100]  but i haven't really even mentioned that because
[02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:22.620]  it's just crazy but there is a danger though that you know even info or if we just kind of get
[02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:32.380]  used to being banned oh roku today facebook tomorrow and and groups calling for don't let any users
[02:53:32.380 --> 02:53:38.300]  even talk about him unless it's negative then that gets promoted and see that was not the unseen part
[02:53:38.300 --> 02:53:44.140]  i knew that was going to happen but the thing about being banned or throttled back to nothing
[02:53:45.500 --> 02:53:51.180]  on these platforms is everyone is then given free reign once your hands are tied and once you've
[02:53:51.180 --> 02:53:56.700]  got a gag in your mouth to do whatever they want and you realize what cowards they are and that's
[02:53:56.700 --> 02:54:02.860]  why they want children they love the helplessness they love the child begging for mommy they love
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:09.900]  the tying up and the the raping and torturing until they call it using them up and when they're
[02:54:09.900 --> 02:54:17.180]  done slurping the last bit out they drink their blood and then they have sex with a body the dead
[02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:26.300]  body and then they eat the eat the food they eat the baby yeah that's the rituals and so
[02:54:26.300 --> 02:54:28.620]  if they can't abort your children before they're born
[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:36.860]  they eat the pain and orphans of the meat if they can't get them aborted or can't get them
[02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:41.740]  autismed they're gonna hit them with gmo and radiation but they're famous but they're favorite
[02:54:41.740 --> 02:54:48.940]  thing their favorite favorite favorite favorite thing is just what they call listening to the
[02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:55.580]  beautiful music of a little boy or girl beg for mommy oh and the best part sometimes they start
[02:54:55.580 --> 02:55:04.620]  begging god for help oh it's so good and when god doesn't come the child just curls up and the
[02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:13.660]  pedophile comes and opens this gauge and says you're never gonna see jesus and then they rape
[02:55:13.660 --> 02:55:22.860]  him for more but that's okay hollywood has that right right i mean alistair krally in fact killed
[02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:33.420]  his own son twice so respected by these people a potbellied demon and so i just want all these
[02:55:33.420 --> 02:55:39.100]  people to know something you came from hell and you're gonna go back to hell and you're

[03:00:40.540 --> 03:00:45.500]  uh fill all these folks in about these lawyers uh first of all let me let me set a benchmark
[03:00:45.500 --> 03:00:51.740]  real quick uh most all those uh congressmen down in in washington and all lawyers they
[03:00:51.740 --> 03:00:56.380]  go in there with a pair of socks that don't match and leave as millionaires now let's talk
[03:00:56.380 --> 03:01:01.020]  about the ones up here in new york city do you think that president trump was looking for some
[03:01:01.020 --> 03:01:06.140]  powder puff to take care of business up here in new york dealing with the city the layers and layers
[03:01:06.140 --> 03:01:12.700]  of bureaucracies they have to deal with in construction the unions to deal with that guy that guy is
[03:01:12.700 --> 03:01:18.700]  just when he talks all he's doing is exposing exactly what goes on that's all he's doing that's
[03:01:18.700 --> 03:01:24.860]  that's business as usual that's nothing surprising at all i mean i don't know what well you can hear
[03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:28.940]  it the tapes of trump where cohen walks in is trying to set him up we're gonna have to do some
[03:01:28.940 --> 03:01:33.820]  payoffs there's no we're not and then that's the proof of trump doing it cohen absolutely trump
[03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:38.860]  knows in new york wherever he's not corrupt but you got to hire the lawyers who run the system
[03:01:38.860 --> 03:01:43.580]  as the gatekeepers and pay their toll or you don't get jack crack a crap taking care of
[03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:49.980]  yeah these a lot of people don't understand that new york dealing with the construction business
[03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:54.620]  well that's brutal anywhere you go but especially in new york you're dealing with a lot of people up
[03:01:54.620 --> 03:01:59.820]  here i mean layers and layers of bureaucracies for one thing the city oh lord going through the
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:04.700]  permanent and business getting the inspections you know of course that you know there's zoning
[03:02:04.700 --> 03:02:10.540]  problems here zone i mean president trump is no fool whatsoever he knows sure but i mean the best
[03:02:10.540 --> 03:02:17.260]  they've got is michael cohen gave money to some internet group promote pro trump polls i mean this
[03:02:17.260 --> 03:02:23.340]  this is this is what they but they like it because oh maybe big we can get drudge with it yeah but you
[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:30.300]  know like you know michael cohen like i said you know he he's one of them you know you know how can
[03:02:30.300 --> 03:02:35.420]  you believe the guy he got busted for lying to congress yeah he would sell his mother out for
[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:40.060]  a stick of bubblegum Jerome great points god bless you all right let's take another one cohen
[03:02:40.060 --> 03:02:47.580]  nick in michigan you're on the air hello Alex how you doing we spoke last week a little bit
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:51.900]  about you engineering when i got cut off i was never able to call back in so we can talk about
[03:02:51.900 --> 03:02:57.020]  that after but i'm the cohen thing uh it seems like almost to me i don't know if it's overthinking
[03:02:57.020 --> 03:03:01.900]  it or not but almost seems like this guy can be like a you know just a bad another one of bad
[03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:07.180]  moles put in place to make some mistakes oh absolutely you know cohen for years has been
[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:14.780]  trying to get dirt on from to exploit new things exactly but again expanding off that i think with
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:21.100]  the roku thing and you um all they can do at this point is keep you off the air i think they realize
[03:03:21.100 --> 03:03:25.980]  that if your message is able to get out there actually make actually make the airwaves that you
[03:03:25.980 --> 03:03:31.740]  know you'll actually start getting on mainstream coverage Alex and with the roku that's just as
[03:03:31.740 --> 03:03:36.620]  quick as they can get you off before any of your new real message gets out there and then and another
[03:03:36.620 --> 03:03:42.140]  caller said all these uh scripted media outlets just have the scripted headline ready to put it
[03:03:42.140 --> 03:03:48.700]  out against you all in line with each other within that hour you know no you're absolutely right and
[03:03:48.700 --> 03:03:54.060]  because they have to silence me so they can then put out the straw man that i'm not and it's just
[03:03:54.060 --> 03:04:00.860]  it's just dastardly what they're doing but these are bad people and again we were on roku seven years
[03:04:00.860 --> 03:04:04.380]  had a lot of viewers on there it was an old app never even thought to make a new one
[03:04:04.380 --> 03:04:09.900]  or new platform and then some fans made one and all hell broke loose because it's shot up to the
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:15.820]  front page because the algorithm showed it was popular and so again that's why we're off the
[03:04:15.820 --> 03:04:20.780]  year not because we're lying not because we're fake news but because we'll talk about what's really
[03:04:20.780 --> 03:04:25.660]  running the show thank you for the call Nick all right when we come back Lindsey in New York on
[03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:33.420]  vaccines Dave in Nevada on Co and the Rat Vox from New York on Globalist Slavic from Kansas on the
[03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:41.660]  SPLC Rebecca in Massachusetts and so much more Dean as well stay with us and Matt Bracken takes over
[03:04:41.660 --> 03:04:48.940]  I'm Alex Jones info wars.com news wars.com next year's news today stay with us whatever you do
[03:04:48.940 --> 03:04:56.220]  spread the word you are the power that can override the globalist living in volcano may sound more
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:05:02.060]  dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Lailania states but a lot of us on
[03:05:02.060 --> 03:05:08.220]  the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic
[03:05:08.220 --> 03:05:14.220]  ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy
[03:05:14.220 --> 03:05:22.060]  levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned
[03:05:22.060 --> 03:05:27.580]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next
[03:05:27.580 --> 03:05:32.940]  we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels
[03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:40.300]  within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on
[03:05:40.300 --> 03:05:46.620]  the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain
[03:05:46.620 --> 03:05:53.180]  can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:05:53.180 --> 03:06:06.860]  defending the republic from enemies born and domestic it's alex jones
[03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:32.380]  after let's stay the way we are right now answer all the love and laughter but a lifetime
[03:06:33.660 --> 03:06:38.860]  can allow think about something wholesome like jork straight versus
[03:06:41.900 --> 03:06:42.860]  the pedophile press

[03:07:03.820 --> 03:07:09.900]  and not because any of us are hero because we're doing it he's just the right thing to do we don't
[03:07:09.900 --> 03:07:17.260]  have a choice all right we're gonna go back to your phone calls right now
[03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:21.900]  lindsey in new york on vaccines you're on the air thanks for calling
[03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:31.340]  alex hi hi how are you i'm i'm thank you uh i just wanted to let you know that uh we keep
[03:07:31.340 --> 03:07:36.220]  you in our prayers and we absolutely love the product thank you ma'am we couldn't do without you
[03:07:36.220 --> 03:07:42.380]  you honestly super silver has been amazing for poison ivy like we have a ton of poison ivy
[03:07:42.380 --> 03:07:48.780]  around our area and i'm into like homesteading and cultivating like uh i forge for medicinal herbs
[03:07:48.780 --> 03:07:53.420]  and stuff like that and uh sometimes they get tangled it up into some poison ivy i'm wicked
[03:07:53.420 --> 03:07:59.820]  allergic and that super silver is then like amazing it just immediately stops the itch and
[03:07:59.820 --> 03:08:03.740]  sure well well there's a super silver immune gargle in three different sizes you can spray on
[03:08:03.740 --> 03:08:08.300]  things that's one type and then we've also got the silver wound gel that's like FDA approved for
[03:08:08.300 --> 03:08:12.940]  stores we probably able to top company in the nation that's super amazing and then there's uh
[03:08:13.580 --> 03:08:18.220]  the the the the colloidal silver but but are you talking about uh the immune gargle which is also a
[03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:24.460]  topical no i've been using the uh the wound gel for the wound gel is so unbelievable
[03:08:25.020 --> 03:08:31.820]  that i mean i just people have to experience it for themselves yeah yeah it's really awesome
[03:08:31.820 --> 03:08:37.180]  but um the reason why i wanted to call is uh because uh our family actually we just went through
[03:08:37.180 --> 03:08:44.140]  the process of uh getting religious exemption for uh so our kids can go to school but also
[03:08:44.140 --> 03:08:49.180]  keep with our beliefs of not wanting to get vaccinated and like honestly like i was super
[03:08:49.180 --> 03:08:53.900]  scared about doing it because you know like living in new york it's one of the most difficult
[03:08:54.540 --> 03:09:00.860]  states to like get religious exemption and uh it actually really wasn't that bad at all the school
[03:09:00.860 --> 03:09:08.060]  was they didn't like look at me like like meanly or you know what you mean it was just really an
[03:09:08.060 --> 03:09:13.100]  easy process actually so i just wanted to call in and encourage other people that if you're thinking
[03:09:13.100 --> 03:09:17.980]  about it like don't you just take that stop try it and you know you know it's a good step to do
[03:09:17.980 --> 03:09:22.460]  as a basic but we should push back and say the illegal aliens you bring them in with no vetting
[03:09:22.460 --> 03:09:26.460]  and you put their kids in our schools and i'm not even mad at the little kids they should be tested
[03:09:26.460 --> 03:09:30.220]  so that they can be taken care of they're gonna be here might as well do that but they don't even
[03:09:30.220 --> 03:09:35.820]  do that so tb spreading all this real stuff spreading and then they go oh fill out this form for the
[03:09:35.820 --> 03:09:40.620]  health department send it in so we have a record of who you are for religious uh you know exemption
[03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:44.860]  or other exemptions california has gotten rid of the exemptions and so they're trying to say it's
[03:09:44.860 --> 03:09:49.340]  mandatory it's it's all total fraud you know and i say hey how about you take the shot and again
[03:09:50.220 --> 03:09:55.180]  it's social control they are adding things to the vaccines i wish they had clean vaccines
[03:09:55.180 --> 03:09:58.620]  i wish they then admitted even clean vaccines can cause an autoimmune response but they are
[03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:06.540]  are spiking them 100 percent it's compartmentalized the average doctor doesn't know it's a fact the
[03:10:06.540 --> 03:10:11.180]  inserts say it can kill you so i would take the next step you've done a great job lindsay
[03:10:12.060 --> 03:10:16.460]  i go to the pta the website is the main place that i got all my information about why i don't want
[03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:21.980]  to vaccinate is because you look at all the different uh the uh side effects from the vaccinations
[03:10:21.980 --> 03:10:27.500]  it's crazy you know i mean it's our own immune system that creates the immunities it's not the
[03:10:27.500 --> 03:10:33.260]  vaccination that just introduce the pathogens to you know what you mean so like if you just
[03:10:33.260 --> 03:10:37.580]  get into like healthy living and and herbals and stuff like that you can build your immunities
[03:10:37.580 --> 03:10:42.380]  yourself i want to knock on wood i get allergies which means my immune system is cranked up battling
[03:10:43.340 --> 03:10:51.740]  but i mean i want to knock on wood here i get a fever maybe every three years i mean i just don't
[03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:58.220]  get sick now other than allergies uh and that's my body swinging for the fences i mean it knows it's
[03:10:58.220 --> 03:11:04.060]  under attack the gmo all of it uh and so you know i mean i got a hyperimmune system turned up
[03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:09.420]  when you when it gives up you get cancer folks god bless you man i appreciate your call the next step
[03:11:09.420 --> 03:11:15.180]  lindsay is getting your facts together reading the inserts from the vaccines you can get it at
[03:11:15.180 --> 03:11:20.380]  wall greens anywhere say i want the inserts by law they got to give them to you not their fact sheet
[03:11:20.380 --> 03:11:26.620]  that's bull it's like george soros's free speech band groups called free press their fact sheets the
[03:11:26.620 --> 03:11:35.100]  bs sheet you want the insert that comes in a little white box that the ampule that you have that the
[03:11:36.140 --> 03:11:42.860]  bottle of vaccines in and you want that you just go read front and back that at city council
[03:11:43.740 --> 03:11:47.420]  all the ways it kills you all the ways it gives you cancer all the ways it can cause
[03:11:47.420 --> 03:11:51.900]  autoimmune disorder all the ways it can cause eombrae that's getting paralyzed till you die
[03:11:52.780 --> 03:11:59.420]  and then just sit there and say now parents know that and i'm telling you i guarantee
[03:12:01.020 --> 03:12:08.140]  you go do that at a city council or pta this word of mouth you'll save two babies from being
[03:12:08.140 --> 03:12:13.980]  brain damage or dead so again folks you want to take action this is the way to do it
[03:12:13.980 --> 03:12:17.820]  we can show you everything
[03:12:19.740 --> 03:12:24.700]  and about almost all vaccines by the way have cancer viruses in them oh and they don't just
[03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:30.940]  accidentally have one run of the mill when they seem to always have super rare super deadly ones
[03:12:31.980 --> 03:12:38.620]  that come from immortal gene lines you're like wait a virus is RNA that's DNA
[03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:46.540]  they are i'm not a microbiologist i just read the reports they somehow in these micro plasmas in case
[03:12:46.540 --> 03:12:57.020]  the viruses in an immortal seed line immortal cell line you understand an immortal cell
[03:12:57.980 --> 03:13:01.980]  first time they found it was in the 50s it was a black lady cancer killed her in two weeks
[03:13:01.980 --> 03:13:07.900]  it was a black uh for her name pull up immortal cell line black lady uh she died in two weeks from
[03:13:07.900 --> 03:13:12.220]  cancer and they put cancer in a petri dish i guess what happened
[03:13:15.740 --> 03:13:23.740]  it didn't need anything it just it's a zombie there's a lot of weird stuff going on yeah hereta lax
[03:13:25.180 --> 03:13:31.420]  henryetta lax 1951 was an african-american woman whose cancer cells are the source of the hela
[03:13:31.420 --> 03:13:36.780]  cell line the first immortalized cell line and one of the most important cell lines in medical
[03:13:36.780 --> 03:13:43.420]  research because one thing kills it and that's fire you've seen these space alien movies where
[03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:50.540]  they get something on the ship nothing can kill that's it so you go ahead and roll your sleeve
[03:13:52.860 --> 03:13:56.860]  because they're going to give you something that's going to make you feel real good
[03:13:57.500 --> 03:14:02.620]  but they learn with the metronogenic properties of these to test them in a primates and other
[03:14:02.620 --> 03:14:10.780]  mammals to where they trigger later and they normally do it where the hormones dip
[03:14:11.500 --> 03:14:17.260]  and around 65 when you go in retirement and then those those immortal cell lines are waiting
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:25.180]  and inside the cell they're carrying a weaponized cancer virus so see it's a delivery system not
[03:14:25.180 --> 03:14:32.380]  so much a binary weapon and then they suck all your savings out with all the chemo and everything
[03:14:32.380 --> 03:14:38.940]  it's so liberal the only thing better for the globalist is kidnapping children or funding
[03:14:38.940 --> 03:14:45.500]  radical islamists to sex trade and kidnap women and children remember when you think about the
[03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:52.700]  globalist they are the worst people on earth who seek power and who are in control i swore to take
[03:14:52.700 --> 03:14:57.180]  your calls i'm not trying to do this once a week when i go over and around the map brackets i took
[03:14:57.180 --> 03:15:02.460]  over from uh what uh roger stone of the day and a bunch of other people and everybody understands

[03:15:22.380 --> 03:15:30.940]  against trump and everybody who thinks they're smart is putting their finger in the wind and
[03:15:30.940 --> 03:15:38.460]  deciding to back away but are people backing away because trump is faltering you know i don't want
[03:15:38.460 --> 03:15:43.740]  to blame people before i know the full story but i i just think people getting death threat and stuff
[03:15:43.740 --> 03:15:47.500]  i think i think people say you know i've been in this fight a long time but i'm not gonna lose

[03:20:14.140 --> 03:20:17.820]  i think i'm gonna stay around i'm always here anyways and through the war room some of the
[03:20:17.820 --> 03:20:23.580]  oan coming up because i got more to say you know polosi said oh we won't invite you for the state
[03:20:23.580 --> 03:20:28.620]  of the union to congress Trump's like great you're not getting military transport which under the
[03:20:28.620 --> 03:20:35.580]  executive is most of the planes uh that congress is using so by the way she's worth hundreds of
[03:20:35.580 --> 03:20:40.140]  millions of dollars i mean billions she swindled out and paid her husband and stuff uh so it's
[03:20:40.140 --> 03:20:45.660]  really hilarious uh that polosi can still take a trip the government will pay for uh you know on
[03:20:45.660 --> 03:20:51.420]  commercial but she has to fly commercial so she flies around on a jet as big as air force one
[03:20:53.420 --> 03:21:01.580]  unbelievable so that is hilarious that is absolutely totally hilarious uh that but this
[03:21:01.580 --> 03:21:05.580]  has reached this has reached civil war levels the government and i'm glad from standing up
[03:21:05.580 --> 03:21:11.740]  okay who's that let's move quick here uh let's go ahead and talk to rebecca in massachusetts
[03:21:11.740 --> 03:21:17.100]  rebecca you're on the air thanks for holding hi how are you i'm doing pretty good talking to you
[03:21:17.100 --> 03:21:22.380]  thanks for calling of course um i just wanted to talk to you because it's been placed on my
[03:21:22.380 --> 03:21:28.380]  heart been a long time listener been listening since i was like 12 um as you've mentioned before
[03:21:28.380 --> 03:21:34.940]  everything boils down to a spiritual root and a spiritual cause and therefore for that i just
[03:21:34.940 --> 03:21:40.700]  want to encourage you and knowing that god is for you and not against you that he's placed you here
[03:21:40.700 --> 03:21:46.860]  for such a time as this but he also i believe would like to encourage you to even teach your
[03:21:46.860 --> 03:21:53.340]  viewers how to pray because behind every demonic force for example with this whole thing with abortion
[03:21:53.340 --> 03:21:59.100]  with this whole thing of pedophilia behind it is actually that ancient spirit of veil and it is a
[03:21:59.100 --> 03:22:04.380]  real spirit and therefore the church needs to learn how to pray against it now i totally agree
[03:22:04.380 --> 03:22:09.020]  and that's not the false church people get turned off by but but really this is good and evil the
[03:22:09.020 --> 03:22:14.780]  spirit of liberty and life versus the spirit of a basic vampiric wickedness and i've i always have
[03:22:14.780 --> 03:22:18.860]  a guilt that i'm not doing enough or fighting hard enough i'm always angry at myself for not doing
[03:22:18.860 --> 03:22:23.740]  enough and i've never had an experience like the last 48 hours where it's the next level
[03:22:23.740 --> 03:22:28.780]  holy spirit where it's not it's like you're doing good i know you're trying as hard as you can and
[03:22:28.780 --> 03:22:34.540]  back here's some knowledge and it's so hardcore and so huge i'm not just saying this i i like
[03:22:34.540 --> 03:22:38.380]  i'm experiencing stuff that i'm not ready to talk about yet on air but a lot of the people are right
[03:22:38.380 --> 03:22:43.580]  now because we prayed for christ you know to come back into the world god's spirit at times like this
[03:22:43.580 --> 03:22:48.700]  and people are praying and it's happening and i mean i have just been having eureka moments of
[03:22:48.700 --> 03:22:54.300]  deep understanding and and just god comforting that hey you know it's okay but it's the crazy
[03:22:54.300 --> 03:22:58.700]  thing you expect when i could run for a torn Achilles was in better shape two or three four miles in
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:03.100]  you feel like hell but all of a sudden boom it hits i can go six seven eight nine miles i've
[03:23:03.100 --> 03:23:07.260]  never a super long distance but i've run eight miles before usually i've run six miles when the
[03:23:07.260 --> 03:23:12.540]  second wind would end but it's like i've hit this second wind and it's it's so thanks for all your
[03:23:12.540 --> 03:23:17.260]  prayers i know a big part of it is the listeners praying for me and i'm not perfect but i'm trying
[03:23:17.260 --> 03:23:21.740]  hard so thank you for the prayer thank you so much and i just leave you with something maybe
[03:23:21.740 --> 03:23:28.220]  believe it the viewers sure if it's possible um if you look up wind whirling he has this whole
[03:23:28.220 --> 03:23:34.780]  segment on destroying the roots of Babylon and in that it showed how the church prayed for reagan
[03:23:34.780 --> 03:23:40.540]  and how the enemy was trying the demonic enemy was trying to keep him out but it was the prayers
[03:23:40.540 --> 03:23:47.420]  and how god directed them specific prayers against the federal reserve against the irs against all
[03:23:47.420 --> 03:23:52.060]  of these things he has a book called i'm warfare prayers with wind whirling and i believe that
[03:23:52.060 --> 03:23:56.220]  if you could just even post it on your site people that will feel led will pray and i feel
[03:23:56.220 --> 03:24:01.980]  like it'll also really really bless your station as well well god bless you man i appreciate that
[03:24:01.980 --> 03:24:06.860]  thank you rebecca okay let's go ahead and talk to slavic in kansas here on the air thanks for
[03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:12.220]  holding hey hey alex can you hear me yes i can thanks for holding yeah alex first of all i've
[03:24:12.220 --> 03:24:17.420]  been listening for many years i'm from ukraine and i came to america about 17 years ago but
[03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:21.580]  you're the first one to really wake me up to the new world order and uh i actually applied to this
[03:24:21.580 --> 03:24:26.940]  da i was about to be hired but then i i learned about everything that was behind and you know
[03:24:26.940 --> 03:24:31.260]  and you really woke me up to us i want to thank you for that thank you and uh and all your yeah
[03:24:31.260 --> 03:24:35.580]  your brain force product i gotta tell you that is the best thing that i've ever taken because it
[03:24:35.580 --> 03:24:41.180]  really has helped me to work so it's pretty it's pretty awesome product so keep it going well
[03:24:41.180 --> 03:24:45.660]  all we did was see what the top products were make them stronger and then lower the price so thank
[03:24:45.660 --> 03:24:50.940]  you but that's our that's our formula yeah absolutely and uh so i want to be a common spiel
[03:24:50.940 --> 03:24:55.660]  silo but so you know it's kind of doing some thinking and you know spiel fee is literally
[03:24:55.660 --> 03:25:01.740]  literally the legal arm of antifa you know and antifa is the arm of the globalist fascist hydra
[03:25:01.740 --> 03:25:07.020]  you know like from the captain america movies so it's just like the public arm of the cia and you
[03:25:07.020 --> 03:25:11.260]  know because the cia no one's gonna listen to the cia so the cia has to use you know spiel see in
[03:25:11.260 --> 03:25:18.060]  other groups to break up the family and make whites look evil so well that's what they're doing is
[03:25:18.060 --> 03:25:22.780]  they're creating racial division in america so we're a divided nation in fall they are globalist
[03:25:22.780 --> 03:25:27.580]  they're a poison introduced into the people and again i'm not lionizing the average minority
[03:25:27.580 --> 03:25:32.620]  most quote minorities who are the majority of most areas they're good people but this is just
[03:25:32.620 --> 03:25:37.020]  pumped in even if you're not a racist doesn't matter if you're black or you're white you get uncomfortable
[03:25:37.020 --> 03:25:40.700]  around people you don't know if they're another color because you've been told be uncomfortable
[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:46.700]  and that's just evil right yeah absolutely it's just total evil and you're probably familiar with
[03:25:46.700 --> 03:25:53.340]  the okc bombing but you know splc they say labeled every constitutional state militia group uh as evil
[03:25:53.340 --> 03:25:57.420]  when they were trying to expose the whole akc bombing i don't know if you remember well i do
[03:25:57.420 --> 03:26:03.020]  remember the splc was running elaheem city that mcvay was out of so splc from my research was
[03:26:03.020 --> 03:26:09.740]  quarterbacking the whole thing yeah absolutely and you know just going off on on the whole
[03:26:09.740 --> 03:26:14.220]  traders within the trump government you know there's this book i think she checked out by
[03:26:14.220 --> 03:26:18.860]  brad mesters called the first conspiracy um you know the plot to kill george washington
[03:26:18.860 --> 03:26:22.460]  and i'm sure you're more familiar with george washington's life but he actually had people
[03:26:22.460 --> 03:26:28.300]  within his ranks when there's like a secret service and tried to assassinate him in 1776
[03:26:28.300 --> 03:26:31.980]  and it's the same thing that's happening to trump today you know i know you don't get taught that
[03:26:31.980 --> 03:26:35.740]  history but like a lot of the pistols misfired same thing happened over and over and over again
[03:26:35.740 --> 03:26:42.700]  with uh with uh people like jackson yeah absolutely yeah and before i go i wanted to give you a
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:46.300]  t-shirt idea i don't know if it's something you could think of it but you know how alexandria
[03:26:46.300 --> 03:26:51.260]  cortez she looks like in the alien movie you know with a big mouth and big teeth coming out
[03:26:51.260 --> 03:26:57.180]  you know you should put out aoc and then the alien you know picture side by side with her big
[03:26:57.180 --> 03:27:01.900]  mouse open no i agree and she didn't look like that a few years ago i mean she looks exactly
[03:27:01.900 --> 03:27:06.780]  like a method and i predict she's going to end up really embarrassing them i predict she has a
[03:27:06.780 --> 03:27:15.100]  collapse a total breakdown within one year i mean she is a in my research opinion i think she's a
[03:27:15.100 --> 03:27:21.420]  molly addict or a methamphetamine addict i mean she looks like a crack whore yeah she does have a
[03:27:21.420 --> 03:27:26.700]  mess now so you're definitely right on that i mean she looks like you know crack whores you see uh
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:31.900]  in dallas or florida miami wherever i've seen you know crack whores all she needs is like the long
[03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:36.780]  shirt kind of in the short shorts walking around in parking lots and i thought ah and i mean that's
[03:27:36.780 --> 03:27:42.540]  it she's i feel very sorry for her she's a crack whore probably and yeah and alex you know i wanted
[03:27:42.540 --> 03:27:46.060]  to encourage your other viewers or anyone tuning in that you know thinks you're a crack whore or
[03:27:46.060 --> 03:27:51.260]  something because i talked to a high-level colonel i'm not going to mention his name but he was a
[03:27:51.260 --> 03:27:56.860]  flag officer in the u.s army he basically confirmed everything you've ever said about you know 9 11
[03:27:56.860 --> 03:28:02.540]  being inside job he told me that you know uh every staff a flag officer knows and it's that job but
[03:28:02.540 --> 03:28:07.020]  they're all afraid to come out because they were afraid to lose their families you know or they're
[03:28:07.020 --> 03:28:11.100]  well that's it and in the system soon a lot of the robots fly on the plane so the end of the age of
[03:28:11.100 --> 03:28:15.340]  men which the women are being taught is a great thing no it's the end it's the end of humanity
[03:28:15.340 --> 03:28:20.140]  and doesn't mean radical islam isn't real or it means the globalists are working with it they're
[03:28:20.140 --> 03:28:23.740]  doing it like they've opened up europe like they're doing it all and trump's trying to end the
[03:28:23.740 --> 03:28:29.100]  destabilization of europe he's trying to bring forth uh something that is actually pragmatic
[03:28:29.100 --> 03:28:34.380]  and works okay i'm not going to run walk over matt bracken anymore even though he's agreed to it
[03:28:35.260 --> 03:28:40.620]  let me take over when he goes i'm sorry to vox and david and white knight and dean call me back

[03:33:16.700 --> 03:33:22.620]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[03:33:27.260 --> 03:33:33.740]  no it's um not alex jones it's matt bracken but i think alex is still around so we can kick the
[03:33:33.740 --> 03:33:39.980]  ball back and forth a little bit we will take some calls in a bit at eight seven seven seven
[03:33:39.980 --> 03:33:47.180]  eight nine twenty five thirty nine that's eight seven seven seven eight nine alex and uh first
[03:33:47.180 --> 03:33:54.300]  we want to continue talking about this social media de-platforming it's good it's beyond obvious
[03:33:54.300 --> 03:34:01.180]  now i wish i could say that i was surprised by this flap over the over roku the roku app
[03:34:01.180 --> 03:34:07.820]  but it's really just part of the seamless effort of the of the powers that be to de-platform
[03:34:07.820 --> 03:34:12.700]  dissidents you know in china they just have the government do it and they call it the social
[03:34:12.700 --> 03:34:20.300]  credit system and i think it's in a way more effective here because we have the the de-platforming
[03:34:20.860 --> 03:34:27.900]  done under the veneer of of private corporations you know so you can say well i mean twitter facebook
[03:34:28.460 --> 03:34:33.980]  they've they've kicked you off but they're just private organizations but if the effect is that
[03:34:33.980 --> 03:34:40.700]  you have basically gotten your microphone cut off what's the difference you know i'm currently on my
[03:34:40.700 --> 03:34:47.820]  seventh thirty day facebook ban in less than a year and a half so if you do the math they'll let me
[03:34:47.820 --> 03:34:53.740]  stay on for about a month then they'll kick me off for a month and what i'm concluding from that
[03:34:53.740 --> 03:34:58.940]  it's kind of like um i think i'm trying they're trying to send me the message that they just
[03:34:58.940 --> 03:35:04.060]  don't want me around but they can't point to anything and say you know here's a here's a
[03:35:04.060 --> 03:35:09.900]  violation of terms of service so they're just making it such a hassle that you'll just give up and
[03:35:09.900 --> 03:35:16.460]  quit um and i might i i thought i sort of look at it like a beaten wife looking at a bad marriage
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:22.620]  you know you keep saying well i mean he's really great sometimes you know he takes me out to wonderful
[03:35:22.620 --> 03:35:29.340]  dinners it's just that then he'll slap me around and beat me when i get home um then sooner or later
[03:35:29.340 --> 03:35:36.140]  the wife has to say i've just got to leave even though the guy's rich he's got a fancy house and
[03:35:36.140 --> 03:35:42.460]  fancy cars it's an abusive relationship so i don't know if i'll be back on facebook at all
[03:35:43.260 --> 03:35:48.860]  you know last fall a couple months ago i was perma banned from twitter i'd never been suspended
[03:35:48.860 --> 03:35:56.700]  nothing i was perma banned over a birka meme that didn't even name a religion and you know
[03:35:56.700 --> 03:36:03.100]  when trying to send in the appeals all you get back is a is a form response you know just a a
[03:36:03.100 --> 03:36:10.380]  robo response that says that their terms of service say that you can't post anything that's
[03:36:10.380 --> 03:36:17.260]  hateful towards towards any religious groups well as we've seen with twitter bowing down to islam
[03:36:17.260 --> 03:36:25.100]  um pakistani sharia judges can demand that they kick people off of twitter at least in pakistan
[03:36:25.100 --> 03:36:31.980]  but this seems to be extending globally so essentially what sharia blasphemy laws mean is
[03:36:31.980 --> 03:36:39.180]  anything that offends any muslims and twitter is fine with that so that the last place that i'm
[03:36:39.180 --> 03:36:43.660]  you can find me if you actually want to see what i'm posting and what i post is what i'm reading
[03:36:43.660 --> 03:36:50.620]  what i'm studying so if you want to know what i'm looking at you can find me still on freesoxy.com
[03:36:50.620 --> 03:36:56.220]  that's about it and you know so that the the light the little uh the spotlight grows smaller and
[03:36:56.220 --> 03:37:02.220]  smaller until like i guess eventually it blanks out but that's just the way it is and my overall
[03:37:02.220 --> 03:37:10.460]  point here is it's up to you the individual viewer internet user to keep searching for the truth it
[03:37:10.460 --> 03:37:16.700]  may take a few more clicks you may have to do some more searching you know there otherwise you know
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:24.060]  brain the mass brainwashing there's no doubt the mass brainwashing works that's the the overall
[03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:30.140]  effect that's going on we've all i'm sure we've all watched the Gillette ad about 20 times by now
[03:37:30.140 --> 03:37:35.740]  or maybe you can't stand to watch it i can't either but i've seen clips of it while watching the
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:41.420]  youtube videos about it by a lot of smart people like paul joseph watson and that there's no doubt
[03:37:41.420 --> 03:37:52.620]  that that there's a a social uh push a real societal attack going on to tear down the pillars of
[03:37:52.620 --> 03:38:00.220]  western civilization and one of the most important pillars of that civilization is let's face it
[03:38:00.220 --> 03:38:08.860]  strong european christian or you know christian heterosexual males why heterosexual because
[03:38:08.860 --> 03:38:16.380]  the family is the building block of any successful long-lasting society if you want to wreck a
[03:38:16.380 --> 03:38:23.500]  society wreck the family so that's how it's being done at the at the individual level you know hollywood
[03:38:23.500 --> 03:38:30.860]  and madison avenue they push out the themes that white men christian white heterosexual men are
[03:38:30.860 --> 03:38:37.260]  the evil ones they're the target and what this does it's it signals to the population at large
[03:38:37.900 --> 03:38:45.500]  that white christian heterosexual men are fair game if you created an ad campaign or any kind of
[03:38:45.500 --> 03:38:51.500]  posters anything attacking any other group just for being a member of the group you know women
[03:38:51.500 --> 03:38:58.780]  you know women gaze an ethnic minority it would never fly you'd be off the air in seconds yet
[03:38:59.340 --> 03:39:05.100]  white christian heterosexual men you can make fun of them they're buffoons they're idiots they're
[03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:11.740]  cucks you know you need a strong minority man to come in and save the the the women like on
[03:39:11.740 --> 03:39:18.940]  bird box you know that it's it's just so pervasive it's really disgusting so what we have to do is
[03:39:18.940 --> 03:39:26.220]  is just be strong and keep looking for the truth everywhere that we can so that the powers that
[03:39:26.220 --> 03:39:30.140]  be i don't know what you want to call it if it's a conspiracy if it you know these people don't
[03:39:30.140 --> 03:39:36.620]  meet in the same room i don't think but they all think like a borg the collective mind hive that
[03:39:36.620 --> 03:39:43.260]  you find in in new york and in hollywood that collective mind hive is totally pushing out the
[03:39:43.260 --> 03:39:51.100]  same message and it's attacking at the individual level to demoralize boys to convince them that
[03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:57.180]  it's no use even looking for a woman no use you'll never have a family you'll never be able to support
[03:39:57.180 --> 03:40:04.380]  and raise a family and at the same time at the national level we're watching this push for open
[03:40:04.380 --> 03:40:10.620]  borders to just flood the country you know with third world people that don't speak english don't
[03:40:10.620 --> 03:40:17.980]  share our values don't know or care what the constitution is and i have i came up with a
[03:40:17.980 --> 03:40:25.740]  a little equation it's kind of um kind of funny i call it the the dunning kruger effect plus clout
[03:40:25.740 --> 03:40:32.140]  a clowered piven that's the democrat plan that's the democrat strategy so you if you
[03:40:33.660 --> 03:40:39.740]  assist the lower you know the morons of your society in every way to have more children
[03:40:39.740 --> 03:40:46.060]  basically pay them to have children ensure that they get the vote if they don't get out to vote
[03:40:46.060 --> 03:40:52.140]  you'll vote harvest for them you'll go door to door you know with with uh goons convincing them
[03:40:52.140 --> 03:40:57.660]  to sign a piece of paper so that the democrats will count their vote you know you you put that
[03:40:57.660 --> 03:41:03.020]  together with the clowered piven strategy which is which is you know just overwhelm the welfare
[03:41:03.020 --> 03:41:09.340]  system until it collapses and only a national solution is left that's what we've got and
[03:41:09.340 --> 03:41:15.580]  if you're a if you know if you're a christian of european heritage in this country it should by now
[03:41:15.580 --> 03:41:21.900]  feel a lot like you're a jew in germany in say the late 1920s you know what's going to be coming is
[03:41:21.900 --> 03:41:28.700]  an ugly period in our history and i i thank god every day for the wisdom of our founding fathers
[03:41:28.700 --> 03:41:34.620]  who gave us the bill of rights including the first amendment so that they they can't you know if i
[03:41:34.620 --> 03:41:39.980]  can find a channel to talk they can't just come into the room and say you're not allowed to say that
[03:41:39.980 --> 03:41:45.100]  now they can kick me off twitter they can kick me off facebook but i'll still find a way we'll
[03:41:45.100 --> 03:41:50.940]  still find a way to get the message out you know we're never going to quit we're going to we're
[03:41:50.940 --> 03:41:57.420]  going to keep pushing and eventually if they do come after us because this all of all of this
[03:41:57.420 --> 03:42:04.860]  messaging it's clearly the the battle space preparation for a genocide to come they're conditioning
[03:42:04.860 --> 03:42:12.860]  people to accept that old evil white heterosexual men need to be you know thrown out gotten out
[03:42:12.860 --> 03:42:19.980]  of power one way or the other and we've said it before and we'll say it again the second amendment
[03:42:19.980 --> 03:42:24.780]  backs up the first amendment so they would have they you know they would be glad to throw us on
[03:42:24.780 --> 03:42:31.740]  the boxcars and take us to gulags they've just got one problem left they have to figure out how to
[03:42:31.740 --> 03:42:39.020]  defang and declaw us first and believe me they would send us to gulags if they could and you know
[03:42:39.020 --> 03:42:43.820]  trump is not going to be around forever and eventually it's going to be president kamala harris
[03:42:43.820 --> 03:42:51.420]  or or a co alexandria casa and then we'll see what happens next okay we'll be back right after the
[03:42:51.420 --> 03:42:57.340]  break the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[03:42:57.340 --> 03:43:02.700]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it literally
[03:43:03.340 --> 03:43:08.380]  dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine
[03:43:08.380 --> 03:43:14.460]  in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was pretty good
[03:43:14.460 --> 03:43:18.940]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered
[03:43:18.940 --> 03:43:25.100]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and rock ux2 that's been incredible now due to the
[03:43:25.100 --> 03:43:30.540]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals
[03:43:30.540 --> 03:43:35.900]  of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining
[03:43:35.900 --> 03:43:42.860]  it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it supercharges it and makes it even
[03:43:42.860 --> 03:43:48.700]  more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an incredible
[03:43:48.700 --> 03:43:54.940]  discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com our grandparents and great grandparents know that

[03:47:26.780 --> 03:47:35.180]  okay i'm back until the end of the hour and we're going to take some calls in a minute
[03:47:35.180 --> 03:47:46.300]  at 877-789-2539 or 789 alex you know alex mentioned at the end of the last hour you know is
[03:47:46.300 --> 03:47:52.620]  trump seemed to be faltering uh i think that this feud with nancy polosi it's kind of funny
[03:47:52.620 --> 03:47:59.260]  not given her the military airlift but um you know with the state of the union looming on the horizon
[03:47:59.980 --> 03:48:05.660]  i would wish that he was focused like a laser beam on that address because that could really
[03:48:05.660 --> 03:48:11.420]  that could really be a deal changer a real paradigm shifter there's got not going to be
[03:48:11.420 --> 03:48:16.700]  another opportunity like the state of the union address to really make the case for example for
[03:48:16.700 --> 03:48:25.020]  the border wall i mean how many people realize that the border wall funding equals one tenth of one
[03:48:25.020 --> 03:48:31.740]  percent of the budget you know that the pentagon can lose or not account for a hundred billion
[03:48:31.740 --> 03:48:39.340]  nobody cares we've spent i don't know how many trillions in afghanistan syria and iraq over the
[03:48:39.340 --> 03:48:47.420]  last 20 years and the democrats won't give five billion toward a border a border wall and what
[03:48:47.420 --> 03:48:55.340]  this does it absolutely proves that the top most important democrat priority is to keep the borders
[03:48:55.340 --> 03:49:01.820]  open so that they can keep the great replacement going and this is something that working class
[03:49:01.820 --> 03:49:07.260]  americans you know apolitical people people that maybe have given up on the political process
[03:49:07.260 --> 03:49:14.620]  they get it when they see people flooding into the country we don't see it much on a day by
[03:49:14.620 --> 03:49:23.420]  day basis but it's happening and i was very heartened to see president trump just spoke to
[03:49:23.420 --> 03:49:34.540]  and spoke about a man named a man named chilton who is a rancher in arizona he owns a pretty huge
[03:49:34.540 --> 03:49:43.660]  ranch and this guy jim chilton has been funding these border cameras you know the hidden cameras
[03:49:43.660 --> 03:49:49.900]  that show guys like columns of troops they're wearing camouflage they have matching hats
[03:49:49.900 --> 03:49:55.900]  they're wearing camouflage backpacks presumably full of drugs but who knows what's in them no
[03:49:55.900 --> 03:50:01.180]  women no children they're just streaming through the border and they have hours and hours of this
[03:50:01.180 --> 03:50:10.060]  video footage and supposedly trump has seen this video footage now you can see it too go to this
[03:50:10.060 --> 03:50:17.580]  website it's a very good website it's called secure border intel dot org and you know there
[03:50:17.580 --> 03:50:23.580]  are people private citizens who have been putting out their own trail cameras along the border and
[03:50:23.580 --> 03:50:29.980]  catching it the border patrol can't be everywhere that's why we need a barrier when there's nothing
[03:50:29.980 --> 03:50:37.820]  but like you know a three strand broken down cattle fence along the border then the the few
[03:50:37.820 --> 03:50:44.540]  border patrol and duty have to defend in depth back 50 100 miles if there's an actual wall an
[03:50:44.540 --> 03:50:50.220]  actual border barrier then they can just watch the wall and nobody's going to get over if they see
[03:50:50.220 --> 03:50:56.220]  anybody jumping over the wall that can pounce on them but as it is it's a joke we have no border
[03:50:56.220 --> 03:51:02.060]  I wish at the state of the union that president trump would show some of that video that you just
[03:51:02.060 --> 03:51:08.700]  saw I could you know you can go to secure border intel you can see hours and hours of that video
[03:51:08.700 --> 03:51:15.260]  of just hundreds and hundreds of men on a on a nightly basis bringing backpacks into the country
[03:51:15.260 --> 03:51:20.460]  what's in it I don't know what kind of drugs anything there's an old joke how do you smuggle
[03:51:20.460 --> 03:51:26.620]  a suitcase nuke into America you hide it in a pack full of drugs because it's going to get through
[03:51:27.260 --> 03:51:32.940]  and this there there's never been a a low hanging curveball to hit out of the park
[03:51:33.500 --> 03:51:39.420]  like this issue of the border wall so I hope that Trump is really geared up for an amazing
[03:51:39.420 --> 03:51:46.540]  state of the union address but if he can't do it then at least he'll have served as a canary in the
[03:51:46.540 --> 03:51:53.260]  coal mine if he's impeached if he's forced out of office if god forbid you know some nutcase gets
[03:51:53.260 --> 03:52:00.300]  to him and is he's taken out like other presidents have been before him then we'll know that the
[03:52:00.300 --> 03:52:08.140]  deep state is just too strong that we have a sham republic where these senior executive service
[03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:13.660]  deep state overlords are going to run it no matter who we elect to put in in the white house
[03:52:13.660 --> 03:52:20.540]  if trump is taken out at least we'll know that for effect you know another point to be made about
[03:52:20.540 --> 03:52:26.140]  this border invasion and not only is it for the for the democrats it's a beautiful scenario
[03:52:26.780 --> 03:52:34.780]  they get the great replacement our our families get drugs you know flooding into the into uh
[03:52:34.780 --> 03:52:41.900]  into every small town harrow and fentanyl it's coming from mexico and the democrats don't care
[03:52:41.900 --> 03:52:49.740]  because all they want is to replace natural born americans with third worlders who will vote democrat
[03:52:49.740 --> 03:52:55.980]  forever just to get on welfare get the free medical the free health care the free education so
[03:52:56.780 --> 03:53:04.620]  you know if if if trump has the killer state of the union address and i mean i expect him to be
[03:53:04.620 --> 03:53:11.260]  heckled i expect him to be booed there may be a democrat walkout that will not work for them that
[03:53:11.260 --> 03:53:16.700]  will actually make trump look better if they do that because he'll look like the mature adult he
[03:53:16.700 --> 03:53:22.860]  stayed in washington during the entire you know christmas vacation he didn't he didn't bail out and
[03:53:22.860 --> 03:53:29.580]  go to uh you know beach in portorico like the democrats did you know and so another point about
[03:53:29.580 --> 03:53:37.260]  the the masses these caravans when the when people are sent to the border remember the timing and
[03:53:37.260 --> 03:53:44.860]  location of where these groups cross is set by the drug cartels and what the what the cartels do
[03:53:45.740 --> 03:53:51.660]  is flood a zone with refugees particularly you know the women and children they know that that
[03:53:51.660 --> 03:53:57.980]  will draw all the border patrol the ice the customs people away from the sector where they're going
[03:53:57.980 --> 03:54:04.860]  to push these these uh uh patrols of men carrying the drugs in the democrats don't care it would be
[03:54:04.860 --> 03:54:10.300]  so easy to illustrate how this works you know the people get pushed in here all the border patrol
[03:54:10.300 --> 03:54:16.700]  are taken to that area because goodness knows taken care of a sick kid from guatemala is priority
[03:54:16.700 --> 03:54:23.820]  number one and if a hundred guys carrying heroin are trooping in 10 miles east or west they never
[03:54:23.820 --> 03:54:29.740]  see it the private ranchers see it they've got the video we'll never we'll never see it on the
[03:54:29.740 --> 03:54:36.860]  mainstream media but it's pathetic and it's it's embarrassing that we have a trader class that's
[03:54:36.860 --> 03:54:42.140]  embedded deeply into the government primarily the senior executive service that's the peter
[03:54:42.140 --> 03:54:49.660]  strax all of those people they're all ses the media like anderson cooper mockingbird cooper the cia
[03:54:49.660 --> 03:54:56.060]  plant these guys are completely on board with the deep state the intelligence services have been
[03:54:56.060 --> 03:55:02.700]  corrupted co-opted by the deep state and the the entire democrat party and probably half of the
[03:55:02.700 --> 03:55:10.060]  republicans i mean it's it's an it's an embarrassment actually all right enough on that rant let's um
