[00:00.000 --> 00:19.760]  from the info wars dot com new center deep behind enemy lines in occupied texas broadcasting
[00:19.760 --> 00:25.760]  worldwide you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:25.760 --> 00:34.000]  tank over you're listening to alex jones coming to you from deep in the heart of the
[00:34.000 --> 00:38.880]  texas austin broadcasting worldwide thank you so much for joining us on this friday global
[00:38.880 --> 00:44.960]  broadcast the 14th day of april you know i was thinking back last night i was thinking back this
[00:44.960 --> 00:56.080]  morning that i really dropped the ball i should have made a bigger deal quite frankly over the
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.120]  fact that north three is threatening to nuke the task force that the president calls an armada
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.720]  that's what it is a bunch of ships a bunch of warships together going into the south china sea
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.880]  and they're threatening to preemptively attack that task force they're threatening to attack
[01:10.880 --> 01:18.240]  with 100 000 pieces of artillery the south with the capital just 25 30 miles away from the border
[01:18.240 --> 01:25.360]  of north korea and you've got them preparing tomorrow to celebrate the birthday of the first
[01:26.080 --> 01:32.720]  communist dictator in north korea his grandfather kim jong il's father kim jong un's grandfather
[01:32.720 --> 01:39.120]  to test a powerful nuclear weapon tomorrow on a fault line isn't that interesting
[01:39.120 --> 01:44.400]  they always seem to build reactors or test nukes on fault lines you know about the ring of fire
[01:44.400 --> 01:50.640]  korea has quite a few earthquakes it's right by japan right across from japan but only 60 70 miles
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.760]  from japan at the closest point and they're going to test an underground nuclear test which
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.680]  have been linked to earthquakes around the world by the way john benn has a report on that coming
[01:59.680 --> 02:06.400]  up it sounds fanciful unless you know about the seismic history i mean they even admit that all
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.520]  the fracking in the midwest and stuff's causing earthquakes now this is crazy and this this fault
[02:11.520 --> 02:17.520]  lines on a volcano that would go active if they do it it's just on so many fronts it's like a
[02:17.520 --> 02:24.320]  james bond movie you've got a crazy out of control dictator with nuclear weapons threatening everybody
[02:25.040 --> 02:29.840]  with a totally enslaved population of scarecrows starving to death it's just amazing
[02:29.840 --> 02:36.160]  then you've got al-qaeda and isis getting run out of syria and iraq they're now running back
[02:36.160 --> 02:41.680]  to afghanistan where they came from in many cases and they're down these deep labyrinth
[02:43.360 --> 02:50.320]  caves and so the these bombs were designed but they never used to suck all the oxygen out
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.400]  in these caves and kill people they reportedly killed 37 militants dropping the moab that is not
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.080]  one of the biggest bombs it's one of the biggest people know about they've got much much bigger
[03:00.080 --> 03:05.520]  ones and these are just kind of replace the classic ones they roll off the backs of c-130s
[03:06.240 --> 03:11.440]  but it is powerful how many thousand pounds like 11,000 pounds of explosives or something
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.600]  20,000 pounds excuse me the previous one was 11,000 thank you matt for reminding me in my ear
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.120]  i'm teleprompter free but they do pop in when i frequently get numbers wrong we are teleprompter
[03:23.120 --> 03:28.560]  free but there they are dropping the bomb from 30,000 feet and reportedly killed uh
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.000]  from what they've done with reconnaissance everybody inside they were trying to send
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.320]  green berets in to get intelligence obviously one of them got killed so that's what's happening
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.960]  that's a campaign promise that trump is actually carrying out the military would have to wait
[03:40.960 --> 03:46.160]  hours i've had colonel shaver on who ran the program to kill bin laden they'd have to wait for hours
[03:46.160 --> 03:53.600]  um pre 2001 before they would get the go ahead to try to kill bin laden and then by then he'd be
[03:53.600 --> 04:00.560]  evacuated or they would say no you're not allowed to kill him so that's why trump has given the
[04:00.560 --> 04:08.880]  military what he calls total military authorization we've got a clip of that we'll play right now for
[04:08.880 --> 04:18.880]  him and then we come back we're very very proud of the people another really another successful
[04:18.880 --> 04:25.520]  job we're very very proud of our military just like we're proud of the folks in this room we are so
[04:25.520 --> 04:32.960]  proud of our military and it was another successful event did you authorize it sir uh everybody knows
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.160]  exactly what happened so and what i do is i authorize my military we have the greatest
[04:38.160 --> 04:43.680]  military in the world and they've done a job as usual so we have given them total authorization
[04:43.680 --> 04:47.920]  and that's what they're doing and frankly that's why they've been so successful lately
[04:48.560 --> 04:53.440]  if you look at what's happened over the last eight weeks and compare that's really to what's
[04:53.440 --> 04:58.000]  happened over the last eight years you'll see there's a tremendous stay with us folks we'll be back
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.600]  remember lois learner the lois learner who was director of the exempt organizations unit of the
[05:03.600 --> 05:08.640]  irs the lowest learner who has the same haircut as shugar in no country for old men the woman who
[05:08.640 --> 05:13.200]  was under investigation for denying conservative groups tax exempt status or delaying their status
[05:13.200 --> 05:18.000]  until after obama's election in 2012 well she got off scout free after the original investigation
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.160]  found no evidence but skeptical of that rigged outcome representative peter ross cam and
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.320]  representative kevin brady have requested that the new attorney general jeff sessions take another
[05:26.320 --> 05:30.000]  look into the evidence with standing against learner here's representative ross cam but we're
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.960]  convinced that the prior administration was completely dismissive of the referral from the
[05:34.960 --> 05:39.600]  congress that said we believe lois learner committed crimes the ways and means committee
[05:39.600 --> 05:45.040]  is asserting that lois learner is likely to have committed a crime in the denial of due process
[05:45.040 --> 05:49.680]  and equal protection by targeting individuals based on their political philosophy the notion
[05:49.680 --> 05:55.120]  of weaponizing the irs is so corrosive to our democracy we ought not let the statute of limitations
[05:55.120 --> 06:00.880]  lapse without taking another look at it for info wars dot com this is elin shroyer this is alex
[06:00.880 --> 06:05.840]  jones i want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid

[08:19.040 --> 08:25.040]  central texas command center in the heart of the resistance it's alex jones
[08:32.560 --> 08:39.520]  i get accused by msm sometimes of pure mongrel when they're the ones that are actually pushing
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.800]  the world towards war quite frankly i was sitting back looking at my children last night and this
[08:44.800 --> 08:50.960]  morning at breakfast but at dinner and breakfast and i was just thinking to myself how crazy this is
[08:50.960 --> 08:57.040]  and how the world has probably never been this close to all out nuclear war then we are right
[08:57.040 --> 09:01.120]  now that's what the analysts are saying it's what the chinese communists are saying it's what the
[09:01.120 --> 09:08.240]  pentagon saying it's what north korea is saying and you add all these other factors russia and syria
[09:08.240 --> 09:15.440]  and social unrest and collapsing third world countries with huge migrant flows we are entering a time
[09:15.440 --> 09:24.640]  of unprecedented crisis now let me go over some of these headlines for radio listeners that tie into
[09:24.640 --> 09:34.240]  what i was just breaking down with this huge and that's what it is showdown tomorrow i'm definitely
[09:34.240 --> 09:42.800]  going to have to be shitting my the little pocket studio that is an iphone or droid and being ready
[09:42.800 --> 09:50.080]  to go live tomorrow if anything begins to unfold because tomorrow is the birth day of the first
[09:50.080 --> 09:58.560]  dictator of korea kim jong-un's grandfather kim jong-il's father and they are saying they're
[09:58.560 --> 10:06.080]  and they are saying they're going to test their biggest atomic weapon yet tomorrow strangely enough
[10:06.080 --> 10:10.960]  on a active fault line they're right there in the middle of the pacific rim right across from japan
[10:11.920 --> 10:19.680]  by a quasi-active volcano so we're literally entering a james bond movie with a lot of seismologists
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.400]  mainstream news saying it could cause a major earthquake or the volcano to explode like mount
[10:24.400 --> 10:33.600]  st helens nbc news us may launch strike if north korea reaches for nuclear trigger now the president
[10:33.600 --> 10:38.160]  came out we have a clip coming up it's on info wars dot com and he said north korea is a problem
[10:38.160 --> 10:45.280]  that will be taken care of i've given the military total authorization that clips coming up as well
[10:45.280 --> 10:53.760]  but here are the headlines because i tend to want to dial stuff back but japan's readying for nuclear
[10:53.760 --> 11:01.520]  war japan's getting 60 000 people out of south korea their citizens north korea just evacuated
[11:01.520 --> 11:09.840]  most people out of their capital city this is serious and you've got power-tripping loons
[11:10.400 --> 11:15.760]  in north korea that can't even build an automobile and can't even keep electricity on but in two
[11:15.760 --> 11:21.440]  cities but they've got a brainwashed mass of slaves that'll do whatever they're told in human
[11:21.440 --> 11:30.160]  wave attacks and they've had a dictatorship since before the korean war that killed over a million
[11:30.160 --> 11:37.680]  people on both sides more bombs were dropped on north korea in the korean war the korea police
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.440]  action as it was called by the um then were dropped in all the pacific theater in world war two
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.640]  so the koreans are just kept in fear ready for the us to invade any minute as they're told from
[11:50.640 --> 11:56.000]  birth to death from cradle to grave the time they come out of their mother's womb to the time they
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.320]  get put six feet under china warns world war three is inevitable as north korea prepares latest nuke
[12:04.320 --> 12:13.520]  test so we're in a massive countdown here so let's look it up when do they let's look up actually
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.480]  i'm going to do this last night but forgot to can you guys do some research my great teams even better
[12:18.480 --> 12:22.320]  research thing i run on the show they do a great job there as well but if the whole research team
[12:22.320 --> 12:33.040]  in there can look at past atomic test there's been six since kim jung on ascended the communist
[12:33.040 --> 12:36.000]  throne of the people total oxymoron but that's how it always works
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.080]  when did they test them last time during the day late at night seems like sometimes the middle of
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.520]  the night here that's the middle of the day there and that's where the time zones basically
[12:50.160 --> 12:57.600]  what time is it north korea right now because we're talking in 12 to 12 hours or how long
[12:57.600 --> 13:03.360]  most of their days already going to be up over there they're 13 hours ahead of us
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.120]  so 13 hours from now it'll be almost tomorrow here
[13:09.120 --> 13:16.080]  so in the middle of the night tonight when you tuck your children in to go to bed
[13:16.800 --> 13:18.480]  from any time on then
[13:23.920 --> 13:31.680]  they could do the test in fact sooner if they're 13 hours ahead then it's it's almost the 15th
[13:31.680 --> 13:43.840]  there right now so anytime in the next 24 hours or so they detonate this nuclear weapon and there's
[13:43.840 --> 13:50.560]  been rumblings that trump might strike it and i understand why we haven't struck them before
[13:51.280 --> 13:54.560]  because we don't have a nuclear war but kim jung on keeps getting better and better weapons better
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.840]  and better missiles every week the last few months he fires a missile from north korea
[13:59.840 --> 14:07.280]  90 kilometers over and has high powered missiles with conventional payloads to explode right off
[14:07.280 --> 14:12.560]  the japanese coast menacing them saying we'll launch nerve gas we'll launch atomic weapons we'll
[14:12.560 --> 14:19.280]  nuke you if one shot gets fired by south korea on the dmc if anything happens if we hear a car backfire
[14:19.280 --> 14:30.640]  we are going to unleash nuclear weapons on japan nuclear weapons on south korea
[14:30.640 --> 14:36.400]  conventional artillery barrage of 100 000 pieces of artillery they don't have electricity but they
[14:36.400 --> 14:44.240]  got artillery like any other knuckle dragon communist hellhole and then meanwhile right next door
[14:44.240 --> 14:50.080]  south korea is 40 times more prosperous and one of the richest countries in the world
[14:50.080 --> 14:53.920]  and they never had any freedom until the united states liberated them
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.880]  they never had freedom koreans were always slaves and now they get 50 something years of
[15:00.880 --> 15:07.520]  somewhat freedom and they're the apple of the world's eye when it comes to so many things
[15:07.520 --> 15:15.200]  just there you go oh but mit is teaching high school and elementary school and middle school
[15:15.200 --> 15:22.480]  teachers how to teach communism to your class published by mit that's the technology we teach
[15:22.480 --> 15:28.000]  in america now we invented the internet but now now we teach how to be good little communist
[15:28.000 --> 15:44.560]  it's amazing so china warns world war three is inevitable as north korea prepares latest
[15:44.560 --> 15:52.000]  nuke tests we will go to war if they choose north korea warns aggressive trump not to
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.880]  promote to provoke the north korean capital breaking japan preparing to evacuate 60 000
[15:58.880 --> 16:05.200]  citizens from south korea now this is a story from the uk express that is is hype and i'm not
[16:05.200 --> 16:08.880]  defending trump i've looked at the already troop developments the troop movements that were
[16:08.880 --> 16:14.160]  ordered under obama that are continuing donald trump edges closer to russia u.s soldiers land in
[16:14.160 --> 16:22.640]  europe after afghan moab donald trump has sent us military to poland to joint nato multinational
[16:22.640 --> 16:28.560]  battalion just after the u.s president dropped the mother of all bombs the moab on afghanistan
[16:28.560 --> 16:37.680]  those troop deployments are rotations they were already set obama put the order into increased
[16:37.680 --> 16:43.040]  troops by at least 10 000 the middle of last year remember that well that's part of these
[16:43.040 --> 16:48.480]  rotations now taking place tillerson has said that the u.s russian relations have hit bottom
[16:49.120 --> 16:55.840]  that's a diplomatic way and in my research view it's my opinion researched opinion to then say
[16:55.840 --> 17:01.280]  they need to get better we've hit bottom to shut down all the claims were soft on russia saying
[17:01.280 --> 17:05.440]  we've hit bottom now let's come back up and of course that's what he said in the speech as well
[17:06.800 --> 17:12.400]  trump may send 50 000 troops to syria well i told you a couple weeks ago that from our sources
[17:12.400 --> 17:16.560]  but also msm admits that the distance of the numbers there's well over 10 000 troops just
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.480]  last month that have been injected into iraq and into syria and right there in the border region
[17:23.280 --> 17:25.520]  and they're forcing al-qaeda ices out
[17:30.640 --> 17:35.200]  so that's all part of this escalation trump says it's just so that we can defeat al-qaeda and ices
[17:35.200 --> 17:39.840]  and have their flank covered i'll take that at face value because the president's done most
[17:39.840 --> 17:43.760]  of what he said he would do but i got to tell you i don't like it and i'm watching it very very
[17:43.760 --> 17:49.680]  closely because that makes iraq and afghanistan that are horrible quagmires afghanistan is the
[17:49.680 --> 17:57.760]  known definition of a quagmire and then encyclopedia this will be much much worse than that
[18:00.720 --> 18:04.080]  so that's just some of what we've got here and i'm going to cover a lot more when we come back
[18:04.080 --> 18:09.440]  from break but undoubtedly when i go to bed tonight
[18:14.640 --> 18:19.280]  while i'm sitting here right now i mean we're talking about an hour or so it's going to be
[18:19.280 --> 18:26.800]  the new day over in the korean peninsula in the south china sea in japan and china
[18:26.800 --> 18:33.600]  how this works is there's different angles but they newt test
[18:37.520 --> 18:42.080]  and then they start preparing to fire more rockets into the south china sea something they said
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.400]  they're getting ready to do in fact they told us media north korea did yesterday
[18:46.400 --> 18:51.840]  their state-run media said prepare for a big event the next 24 hours well we're now 24 hours later
[18:51.840 --> 18:57.760]  and i looked at and i thought 24 hours that's the 14th not the 15th but when they said it
[18:57.760 --> 19:04.560]  it was basically 24 hours for them because right now as we speak in the next hour or so
[19:04.560 --> 19:10.240]  it's going to be tomorrow there so i thought the big events on the 15th why would they say
[19:10.240 --> 19:15.840]  it'd be today i went oh we're on the other side of the world that's right so starting basically
[19:15.840 --> 19:23.920]  right now that lunatic on a power trip is sitting on top of a bunch of atomic weapons

[24:43.840 --> 24:49.120]  is near officials in china have warned as north korea prepares for yet another nuclear missile
[24:49.120 --> 24:56.080]  test and the us and donald trump are poise intervene now the good news is trump is signaling that he
[24:56.080 --> 25:04.160]  probably won't respond to a nuclear test but if they fire another missile and then it crashes
[25:04.160 --> 25:09.440]  a couple miles off the coast of japan almost kills people in fishing boats has happened multiple times
[25:09.440 --> 25:16.400]  they're gonna have to respond because he keeps threatening to put atomic weapons or nerve gas

[25:21.600 --> 25:28.240]  out there you know mowing the grass or whatever that's basically what kim jong-un's doing i don't
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.800]  particularly want trump to strike but what are you supposed to do when we have defense treaties
[25:32.800 --> 25:37.680]  with japan when they're getting upset and then china has gotten so belligerent us letting north korea
[25:37.680 --> 25:45.680]  run around and do all this that they're taking over the south china sea so this is trump re asserting
[25:46.320 --> 25:51.840]  american sovereignty and dominance in our with our key trading partners we're gonna open the
[25:51.840 --> 25:55.600]  phones up and get your take on how you think trump is handling this when we come back at the next
[25:55.600 --> 26:03.520]  segment china calls for halt to u.s north korea tensions the media had spun this saying oh north
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.160]  korea says there's a big event coming the next day and then i guess it was uh daria pointed this out
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.960]  to me it was a street opening so so they hype it like a big event was coming there's other big
[26:12.960 --> 26:17.520]  events to the nuclear test they've talked about that for a long time but uh our media ran with this
[26:17.520 --> 26:23.840]  so that's an example of how you get more information concerns have been growing that north korea could
[26:23.840 --> 26:31.520]  soon conduct a six nuclear test or more missile launches in defiance of un sanctions and start
[26:31.520 --> 26:37.920]  warnings from united states that its policy of strategic patience was over there has been speculation
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.960]  that donald trump who has now ordered missile strikes in syria and afghanistan was preparing to
[26:42.960 --> 26:48.000]  preemptive strike on the rogue state before the weekend american bombers have been placed in
[26:48.000 --> 26:56.240]  guam ready to strike if the call comes north korea has denounced the u.s for bringing huge nuclear
[26:56.240 --> 27:01.680]  strategic assets to korea to the korean peninsula with a u.s aircraft carrier group headed for the
[27:01.680 --> 27:07.520]  region in preparation for leader kim jong-un's latest demonstration of his country's military
[27:07.520 --> 27:19.600]  muscle and all these crises were bubbling and boiling and starting to erupt before trump got in
[27:19.600 --> 27:28.000]  but well how do you think trumps handled it i'd say a third of our audience absolutely wants to
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.840]  break with trump now another 70 percent or so like the economic stuff that's happened they like the
[27:33.840 --> 27:40.400]  americana they like cutting the un funding about 50 percent and the stock market being up and building
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.600]  a border wall a lot of those promises are being followed through on taking out isis and al-qaeda
[27:45.600 --> 27:51.440]  that's a promise he's fallen through on but i get how people are concerned because if you look at him
[27:51.440 --> 27:57.920]  with a straight trajectory until about 70 days ago it was a straight trajectory on where he said he
[27:57.920 --> 28:04.880]  was going and then with the health care bill he started going like this now with some of the other
[28:04.880 --> 28:09.040]  things they're not really flip-flops because china did raise their currency so no need for a currency
[28:09.040 --> 28:18.880]  war they actually bought you know actually you know folded actually choked but then once he didn't
[28:18.880 --> 28:25.520]  do one thing he said he would do because that bill was bad people now are taking all the other stuff
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.280]  and saying oh look he's breaking his promise on that now and pretty soon you start turning the
[28:31.280 --> 28:37.360]  boat even if it's just four or five degrees at first you stay on that course pretty soon pretty
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.080]  soon you just kind of they're going to circles or kind of go back where you were he can't get
[28:42.080 --> 28:50.160]  anybody appointed is the main problem most of the executive seats are open so he was trying to go
[28:50.160 --> 28:54.720]  perfectly straight did he then start putting establishment people in because there's no one
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.880]  in the establishment but the establishment and everybody works under these establishment wonks
[28:58.880 --> 29:03.760]  these establishment kingpins so you've got to hire them so they'll bring their teams in but then
[29:03.760 --> 29:08.480]  you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't and that's the word of why frustrated and that was
[29:08.480 --> 29:13.120]  the inside baseball 65 70 days ago that he literally had the whole government and revolt
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.120]  against him they were getting ready to assassinate him probably still are openly calling for his
[29:17.120 --> 29:24.560]  overthrow he started compromising and now you see him going off into whatever okay so donald
[29:24.560 --> 29:31.280]  trump's a bad guy let's just have that as a postulate not saying that's the case but for the
[29:31.280 --> 29:40.000]  sake of argument he's joined the goblins what does that mean and where would we be right
[29:40.000 --> 29:48.080]  now if hillary was in place 800 25 at 9 9 2 3 1 800 25 at 9 9 2 3 1 i'm alex jones your phone

[29:55.200 --> 30:04.000]  for the most part info wars has not commented on the united airlines incident because we think
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.880]  world war three is a bigger issue but here's a take on it everyone involved is a jackass
[30:08.880 --> 30:13.120]  let's start with the airline you couldn't raise the offer for someone to take it was a thousand
[30:13.120 --> 30:17.520]  dollars really too high for you you really had a man physically removed from a flight that wasn't
[30:17.520 --> 30:22.640]  even overbooked to the doctor what the heck is wrong with you how old are you what did you think
[30:22.640 --> 30:27.200]  would happen you knew they were removing you from the plane why did you then decide to act like a
[30:27.200 --> 30:32.160]  five-year-old who doesn't want to leave the playground you did this to yourself to the passengers
[30:32.160 --> 30:36.880]  as all of you sit there in horror of what you're seeing and hearing not one of you selfish frauds
[30:36.880 --> 30:41.280]  had the courage to step up and volunteer your seat but you had plenty of courage to videotape it
[30:41.280 --> 30:46.640]  didn't you all in all this man got more attention than severed children in sweden and yemen china
[30:46.640 --> 30:51.200]  moving troops to the north korean border a strange naval flight path off the west coast

[32:46.400 --> 32:51.200]  way from the caveman my ancestors were but i'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence

[33:12.320 --> 33:19.280]  to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule that government by an
[33:19.280 --> 33:29.200]  elite group is superior to government for by and of the people the alex jones show because there is
[33:29.200 --> 33:40.720]  a war on for your mind hello me meet the real me in my misfits wave life a dark black past is my
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.080]  valued possession all right your phone calls are coming up in just a moment we have some amazing
[33:46.080 --> 33:51.840]  collars a lot of military people with amazing insight on this big crisis that's taking place
[33:51.840 --> 33:58.000]  worldwide we have a lot of the militaristic groups like the neocons the establishment left that want
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.760]  america to be a big empire they want to work with saudi arabia to overthrow more secular states and
[34:03.760 --> 34:09.120]  put in ohabia's tyranny that's what's happening in syria that's why i'm against this war because
[34:09.120 --> 34:15.040]  obama and the global has started it that's admitted fact we've got some clips of asad i'm going to
[34:15.040 --> 34:19.600]  get to it and of course your phone calls but asad saying the same thing i said a week and a half ago
[34:19.600 --> 34:25.120]  when this all started he has no motive to do it the rebels have been caught doing it before
[34:25.120 --> 34:29.520]  they rushed with the attacks they blamed them with no evidence
[34:32.560 --> 34:39.040]  cnn's famous for lying our own military doesn't buy it so people people then say well
[34:39.040 --> 34:46.240]  well that's that's horrible then of trump to do that and i get what you're saying
[34:47.760 --> 34:51.760]  and then i sit back and i think they're saying he's a russian agent they say he's soft on syria
[34:51.760 --> 34:54.880]  if he wouldn't have done something they would have ended up impeaching him
[34:56.560 --> 35:01.760]  and removing him and having a wider giant war so for the first time in my life it's weird to
[35:01.760 --> 35:06.080]  have a president who i think's really working for us and trying to defeat the globalists and
[35:06.080 --> 35:13.680]  trying to make america great again but actually using some of their tricks against them like judo
[35:16.640 --> 35:20.960]  and i said the argument clearly is that they agree to destroy the chemicals it hadn't
[35:21.680 --> 35:25.200]  and so that's what trump's standing on then i learned that's exactly what trump was saying
[35:25.200 --> 35:30.800]  privately i told you that on sunday and then on tuesday he came on and said that word for word
[35:30.800 --> 35:36.160]  so it's not just he's telling people over the telephone or in the oval office this stuff
[35:36.160 --> 35:40.560]  we put a transcript out of it he then comes out and says it publicly
[35:43.760 --> 35:49.200]  i just want peace and i want trump to be real and i want trump to deliver on the things he says
[35:49.200 --> 35:54.800]  he's been doing he just signed an executive order blocking abortion funding here in the us
[35:54.800 --> 35:58.400]  in fact i forgot to print that i'm sure it's here in the stack but i got here late today i was
[35:58.400 --> 36:06.720]  taking care of some family work and some family issues and i was reading his new executive order
[36:06.720 --> 36:12.640]  on abortions that's delivering haven't seen that with other presidents have you other republicans
[36:12.640 --> 36:17.600]  i mean he's so much better than even ronald reagan on what he's actually done
[36:20.560 --> 36:24.560]  now there's the new york times trump signs law taking aim at planned parenthood funding because
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.000]  the republicans in the spending bill wouldn't do it they funded it for another six years
[36:31.840 --> 36:36.400]  that's margaret sanger that's the eugenicist that's where hitler got all those ideas hey
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.520]  have your planned parenthood i shouldn't have to pay for it and then liberals go do you want all
[36:41.520 --> 36:46.640]  those poor black babies and i go wow you're really racist they are the biggest race baiting group i've
[36:46.640 --> 36:54.320]  ever seen by the way i don't normally just cover articles because i'm in them because there's usually
[36:54.320 --> 36:59.440]  hundreds of articles a day attacking me tv shows you name it national news but there's one article
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.200]  out of salon i'm gonna get to later if i have time i'm gonna cover this one cernovich is in studio
[37:03.200 --> 37:06.720]  with us i should have mentioned he's a mike cernovich is in studio with us today that's some
[37:06.720 --> 37:14.400]  other special guests gavin mcginnis not even alex jones is able to defend sean spices historically
[37:14.400 --> 37:20.720]  ignorant comments about holocaust centers and then you read the article and it's all dis info
[37:20.720 --> 37:31.840]  things i didn't say lies now look there's roger stone on salon and they're sitting there like a pack
[37:31.840 --> 37:41.440]  of pseudo-intellectual rats and they have this quote here that jones tried to defend spicer
[37:41.440 --> 37:49.120]  on his gassing comment saying he meant like not dropping gas on people a tone deaf remark to anyone
[37:49.120 --> 37:54.080]  who considers jews pow's ethnic polls romanian nomads the physically and mentally disabled
[37:54.080 --> 38:01.040]  gays and others are people now what they did was clip off where i said drop gas on people on the
[38:01.040 --> 38:06.400]  battlefield that's what i said but did do it and i guess they don't even do their own research at
[38:06.400 --> 38:16.880]  salon so they then plagiarized what i said and put that as a quote of what i didn't cover
[38:16.880 --> 38:20.960]  ladies and gentlemen do you realize the magnitude this is a this is next level lying
[38:22.640 --> 38:28.800]  this is next level lying so i only single this out as an example of total sophistic fraud
[38:28.800 --> 38:34.720]  when i say plagiarizing they change the words around a little bit but it's like identity theft
[38:34.720 --> 38:41.360]  i come in accurately historically show where spicer's wrong in a nice way they then flip it
[38:41.360 --> 38:45.200]  say i've attacked him put a bunch of other bull in the article about stuff i never said
[38:45.200 --> 38:50.160]  or out of context then they say oh but jones didn't consider anybody the nazis killed with gas
[38:50.720 --> 38:57.520]  even though he said the nazis did kill people with gas he says they're not people when i specifically
[38:57.520 --> 39:05.520]  didn't just say he killed people with gas i listed the groups they killed which for some
[39:05.520 --> 39:09.360]  reason the media never mentions anybody else that was killed by by nazis i don't know why
[39:09.920 --> 39:17.120]  and then they turned that into anti-semitism by me wow that is that is people living in an echo
[39:17.120 --> 39:29.120]  chamber of fraud that is upset beatniks basically fourth generation beatniks just scum mercenaries
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.240]  i mean salon has articles routinely promoting pedophilia as a good thing that's who we're dealing
[39:34.240 --> 39:41.760]  with here they have weird perv videos with you know men talking about how they love five-year-old
[39:41.760 --> 39:46.960]  girls and showing video of five-year-old girl dancing around her four-year-old girl and then all
[39:46.960 --> 39:52.560]  they've got is your anti-semitic what i say sean spicer's wrong hitler used chemical weapons
[39:52.560 --> 39:59.440]  it's not on the battlefield on people but then on all these other groups on the battlefield on people
[39:59.440 --> 40:06.560]  but on people medically and and and and with and starting with the infirm and the medically
[40:06.560 --> 40:12.400]  and and i list all these groups i listed those groups in my critique they cut that off go oh
[40:12.400 --> 40:17.200]  interesting we're uncreated people let's just take the groups he said hitler killed put it in there
[40:17.200 --> 40:24.400]  and then say he didn't say them whoa what what what do you call a lie like that i don't even
[40:25.040 --> 40:30.720]  because you're you're reading lies like this and it's just like it's next level
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.720]  it's every lie you can imagine combined into one big giant
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.200]  fraud but then i've noticed in their writing all over mainstream medium
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.320]  they've got such uncreated people that what they do is they simply invert what i say
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.640]  spicer's wrong hitler was gassed himself in world war two twice by mustard gas so he hated it
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.960]  in the in the use against military uh who he saw a chivalrous and on his same level
[40:56.960 --> 41:01.280]  i'm not endorsing that i'm telling what hitler said and wrote in my comp i want to go read it
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.320]  they actually want to know what he said or actually want to be scholarly instead of a
[41:05.520 --> 41:10.000]  soft lipstick fop that sits there and acts like you are saying you're liberal because you wear
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.240]  different color socks now but you know dirty mustache or whatever and walk around like trendy
[41:14.240 --> 41:19.520]  trendy i mean this is the real world so i sit there and i lay out exactly in a quick snapshot
[41:19.520 --> 41:25.200]  of what hitler really did but that he used massive chemicals on autistic children and the infirm
[41:25.200 --> 41:30.720]  and the mentally retarded and all these you know nomadic groups and gypsies and jews and on and on
[41:30.720 --> 41:38.240]  and on and on and they say he didn't even humanize he said that the jews weren't humans oh the evil
[41:38.240 --> 41:46.000]  of jones so again they take my name to attack spicer lie that i'm attacking spicer then put
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.840]  all these things i didn't say or didn't do or twist them then say that i said jews weren't humans
[41:51.840 --> 41:57.680]  and then take the quotes i gave in the video live on air of what i did talk about and the groups
[41:57.680 --> 42:03.840]  that were hit humanizing those people and then they take that humanize them lie cut it off and
[42:03.840 --> 42:12.640]  say that i dehumanize them wow next level fraud and you think this is masterful no it's not
[42:12.640 --> 42:18.000]  they invert it's because of no creativity you're like how could that lie be so extensive and so
[42:18.000 --> 42:23.680]  big and so complex because if you invert the truth you're still looking at the truth it's just upside
[42:23.680 --> 42:29.840]  down so you look at it you go whoa see this is a big secret they've got that their lies are pure
[42:29.840 --> 42:35.840]  inversions so that they're not just some made-up fantasy they have some type of aura of truth
[42:35.840 --> 42:41.920]  because you're looking at the truth it's just upside down but you read it basically upside down
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.800]  or backwards or switch whatever they're saying before they give you a paragraph then you have the
[42:46.800 --> 42:51.920]  truth all right i said i go to your calls and i want to and i've got a bunch of clips to go to as well
[42:51.920 --> 42:59.120]  it's just that that's why i get overwhelmed when i come in here and look at 30 40 50 100 200 300
[42:59.120 --> 43:05.040]  articles a day some days and then just each one is just so over the top how they deceive and how
[43:05.040 --> 43:12.880]  they manipulate and how they lie and the things they do it's just incredible but we are the big
[43:12.880 --> 43:19.200]  countdown chinese saying nuclear war is inevitable if they fire a missile into the south china sea and
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.480]  trump says he will shoot it down he may attack if they do a nuclear test and china says it's
[43:24.480 --> 43:31.280]  inevitable in their people's daily they say north korea playing with fire trump prepared to intervene
[43:31.280 --> 43:35.920]  and it's definitely his fault he's the one doing it so what do we just roll over to this guy forever
[43:35.920 --> 43:40.800]  well china has signaled they may nuke north korea if they make the wrong move so the united states
[43:40.800 --> 43:47.200]  doesn't have to do it so this is a serious time but don't take the fact that we haven't had a major
[43:47.200 --> 43:51.760]  regional or larger war in a long time is the fact that it can't happen the longer we go without one
[43:51.760 --> 43:58.160]  historically it tends to mean we're getting closer to it kind of like we're 12 years behind on a 7.6 or
[43:58.160 --> 44:05.840]  more in the whole san andrea's fault area of southern california and that goes all the way up
[44:05.840 --> 44:13.040]  into the other faults in in san francisco and they say now that they're overdue for a 8.2 or more
[44:13.040 --> 44:18.240]  because the longer it goes it goes from a 7 something to an 8 something with their seismographs
[44:18.240 --> 44:24.560]  with their seismology with their understanding of it so it's a good thing we haven't had that
[44:24.560 --> 44:29.600]  giant earthquake but the longer it goes the more pressure builds up what a time to be alive
[44:29.600 --> 44:36.720]  massive earthquake along the san andrea's fault is disturbingly imminent see there's your headline
[44:36.720 --> 44:43.520]  from mainstream media that's from i guess telemundo with their gizmodo front group so
[44:47.120 --> 44:50.800]  and the reason i mentioned that is i have nothing against telemundo and all those channels but when
[44:50.800 --> 44:54.160]  they come in and act like they're us stuff it's kind of like there's a guy on the new york
[44:54.160 --> 44:58.320]  federal reserve that owns that yogurt company that's a muslim that's that's importing all these
[44:58.320 --> 45:01.680]  immigrants and everybody and then there's been some cases you know the things happening bad with
[45:01.680 --> 45:06.160]  the migrants and their children reportedly raping people and then the media said it was a hoax and
[45:06.160 --> 45:12.000]  it turned out it was true and then i learned from the crew and that's he's on the federal reserve
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.760]  board of new york that's the federal reserve that's private and runs all the others it's it's like
[45:17.760 --> 45:23.360]  why what's up with this you know if you're gonna be a foreign latin american publication like gizmodo
[45:23.360 --> 45:28.400]  just tell us that you're a la rica conquista organization that signed on to that side just show
[45:28.400 --> 45:33.440]  us where your armpatch who you are same thing with the with the with the guy with the you know islamic
[45:34.320 --> 45:34.800]  yogurt
[45:37.280 --> 45:42.800]  jobani by the way i don't like that yogurt i like almost every yogurt out there it is the most
[45:42.800 --> 45:47.920]  flavorless it tastes like sludge to me i'm not just saying that because i mean i try anything i'm
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.080]  like what's this years ago my wife i said hey we think of jobani yogurt she didn't know who owns
[45:52.080 --> 45:54.720]  it she was i don't like that yogurt i said yeah that's right
[45:59.280 --> 46:02.000]  so those articles are up there jobani's own private idah hub
[46:06.240 --> 46:09.360]  he said his lawyers call me i'm just like come on man give me a break
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.680]  i'm done tired through we like cover all these mainstream headlines about what's
[46:15.680 --> 46:19.680]  happening at jobani yogurt and then it turns in all these things that i'm bad and i'm the big target
[46:19.680 --> 46:23.760]  because i did a retraction on something one time if you guys think that that's an info wars retreat
[46:24.880 --> 46:30.080]  you're you're in another world my friend i don't want to get you know digressing off into that

[47:56.080 --> 48:00.320]  honest with folks i'm going to do a real hard run at this other five years and i tend to hand the

[48:10.560 --> 48:15.280]  the blue lights frying my eyeballs and doing this is you know these globals always trying to run me
[48:15.280 --> 48:19.360]  out of business or destroy me or kill me all you do is give me energy to fight because it makes me
[48:19.360 --> 48:24.000]  know how bad you are i would have already waddled off into the sunset i'm just trying to stabilize
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.200]  things for my children but again lesser people that come from scum that that that that hate others

[48:34.960 --> 48:39.280]  that are good alone they're never going to leave people that are chivalrous alone which so we just

[55:02.400 --> 55:08.640]  work you're doing thank you um one thing i wanted to bring up uh again i was in uh south korea 2009
[55:08.640 --> 55:13.840]  working with patreon me patreon missile units there and when i got back to tampa you know down
[55:13.840 --> 55:18.080]  mcdonald's think com area there were some terms flying around and one of them that it's public
[55:18.080 --> 55:22.960]  knowledge it's called strategic patients and the cfr and their official website it's all over their
[55:22.960 --> 55:28.400]  stuff and really what they're doing i think this stuff was initially published 2008 2009
[55:28.400 --> 55:32.640]  um they're pretty much alluding to the fact that this was going to occur
[55:33.440 --> 55:37.360]  and you know they knew the tests were going on you could see everything that they've published
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.680]  there and this idea of well we don't know what's going on this is unstable it's pretty
[55:41.680 --> 55:46.720]  ridiculous because essentially if you read into the literature what they were doing
[55:47.280 --> 55:51.760]  was waiting for them to get the capability in order to you know perpetrate this out when
[55:51.760 --> 55:57.120]  they had the right person in office so this is pretty deep when all this stuff happened in syria
[55:57.120 --> 56:00.560]  well that's why i love talking to veterans and people that have actually been over there because
[56:00.560 --> 56:05.920]  that's exactly what's happening the clinton's in 95 and 96 gave them the reactor and the
[56:05.920 --> 56:11.680]  fissile material enough to make the the news reported over a hundred bombs and the republicans
[56:11.680 --> 56:16.240]  called it treason but then a bunch of neocons supported it why in the world when there's four
[56:16.240 --> 56:21.200]  or five other reactors that you could give them in a deal not to build nukes would you give them
[56:21.200 --> 56:29.120]  the reactor to make the nukes so now here we are 20 years later here we are 20 years later
[56:29.120 --> 56:34.400]  dealing with this and as you said they call it strategic tension or whatever and they say that
[56:34.400 --> 56:39.120]  you know strategic patience no they're building up a trigger for world war three just like jose
[56:39.120 --> 56:43.760]  calzen who was a marine corps officer heavily dialed into uh the elites knowing what they're
[56:43.760 --> 56:50.240]  doing he says this is their plan go ahead yes and uh you know i was there during 2009 2010
[56:50.240 --> 56:55.200]  and you know they said that there was a failed missile test right after they right after they
[56:55.200 --> 56:59.360]  shelled that south korean fishing boat we were on lockdown we know what's going on but it really
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.040]  wasn't failed and i'm going to leave it right there i mean they were doing things that were so
[57:03.040 --> 57:08.400]  provocative and you know could have been deemed you know for the force of escalation to be ramped
[57:08.400 --> 57:13.120]  up immediately but this is where the gun to happen because they were setting up liby at the time
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.640]  and that became that administration's goal it shifted from the south pacific into libya and
[57:18.640 --> 57:25.520]  that whole fiasco however with trump being in there now the cfr is in this position where if you read
[57:25.520 --> 57:30.080]  what they got on their website it's pretty interesting because this whole strategic patience thing
[57:30.080 --> 57:34.320]  it's just this weird game that they talk about openly years before these things up you know unfold
[57:34.320 --> 57:39.760]  and then now they used it to let north korea flex its muscles and give china covered and grab the
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.560]  south china sea all part of a globalist plan to set china up and then double cross the united
[57:44.560 --> 57:49.680]  states later and the word is i've got from high up donald trump and others are now double crossing
[57:49.680 --> 57:55.120]  the globalist and so trump's not perfect but they're pissed folks because he is double crossing them
[57:55.120 --> 58:01.040]  he is having america stand back up and that's why they're freaking out there is a war between
[58:01.920 --> 58:09.760]  this dfr and the do d and it's very very deep and all these maneuvers with the fake news everybody
[58:09.760 --> 58:14.720]  and the mainstream media the way that exactly i'm not lionizing the do d but there is a war with
[58:14.720 --> 58:18.320]  what's left of the military that's sold for america with the globalist it's not the military is
[58:18.320 --> 58:22.800]  perfect it just understands that this is a total sellout of the country they're not going along with
[58:22.800 --> 58:27.040]  it so that's the internal battle going on right now and that's exactly what's happening that's why
[58:27.040 --> 58:31.600]  trump's trying to strengthen the military right now as the icon of america so that we side with
[58:31.600 --> 58:36.080]  it and not the globalist now did you figure this out from being there or reading their own publications
[58:36.080 --> 58:41.920]  both both you are listening stay there i'm gonna come right back to you exact
[58:41.920 --> 59:06.960]  these are great callers man live dot com today

[59:48.640 --> 1:00:04.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:22.000]  jones it's not alex jones it's the info war it's you the listeners you are the power it's not
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:27.120]  patronization it's the truth so look in the mirror you are the resistance
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:33.760]  i love taking calls but the calls are so good especially when they're military vets or experts
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:40.000]  let never get to the other calls but finishing up zack in florida if you read the cfr the globalist
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.600]  the their hijackers of nation states transferring power to offshore combines that are above the
[1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:50.400]  law tax exempt setting up a breakaway civilization technocracy in their own words
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:57.520]  and actually trying to suck the united states dry and then demonize us for the whole global
[1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:02.480]  government system they themselves set up and so this is a huge awakening happening with trump
[1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:07.920]  so it's the bigger issue of globalism and crisis instead of having the leftist talking
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:11.600]  about that trumps beginning to not you know execute a hundred percent of what he said
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:15.680]  that doesn't even really matter in the final equation what matters is the people awakening
[1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:19.840]  to the paradigm show what you're saying is absolutely on target and you're saying you
[1:01:19.840 --> 1:01:23.760]  were aware of this in the military how many other people were aware and how did you wake up to it
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:30.000]  well you know being aware is kind of interesting depending on your job and if you see things from
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.560]  a you know a different magnification but i would say everyone's pretty aware that at the time that
[1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:40.560]  i was there 2009 2010 the the tone in the middle the tone in the media wasn't as such everything
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:45.360]  was you know honed in on the middle east but make no mistake when you got you know 30 000 troops
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:49.920]  there and all the artillery that we specialize in there obviously something was going on however
[1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:53.360]  with the current administration that they had in south korea they weren't going to play ball with
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:02:00.480]  obama and them so as you see the south korean this this latest south korean president being impeached
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:06.320]  trump going to taiwan and the shift going on it's so deep that i don't think people understand the
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:10.480]  reality of it we're so you know this instant gratification we don't get it but in sincon i'm
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:15.360]  down in the tampa florida area and that's pretty much pig on south but uh it's pretty open about
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:19.680]  what's going on there i mean it would you know they were just waiting for this to happen but um
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:25.440]  when trump shifted with the siria attacks before meeting the chinese president marwago
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:28.960]  that was a signal to anybody on that peninsula who knows what they're doing what happened to be
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:35.120]  an artillery air defense predominantly that uh things are changing and they're happening quickly
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:41.840]  and the cfr stuff i got i caught wind up in 2010 um i probably shouldn't get into that but 2010
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.480]  talked to some people down in sincon but uh it's public knowledge they're so brazen it's on their
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:50.400]  website nobody reads this stuff nobody's gonna go read the actual literature on the cfr but i mean
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:55.360]  it's been there it's time stamp you can go see it right now and uh you're absolutely right and so
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:03:02.640]  trump is playing 5d chess here and he's for real he's irrevocably wrecking globalism with just his
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:08.880]  actions transferring power back to the republic until just 20 30 years ago presidents didn't
[1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:13.920]  micromanage the military they had missions congress authorized it he's transferring powered back to
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:20.720]  the states back to the people back to the military back to doctors in the medical facilities the
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:28.240]  globalist setup a technocracy to control everybody trump is devolving power back but that's the real
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:33.040]  mission of the patriots in the intelligence agencies and the civil war that's taking place
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:37.840]  right now and i'm just glad that you know that the military is so informed about what's happening
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.000]  and i hope the public understands just how serious this is but from your research what do you think
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.600]  i mean you think trump's being compromised by being threatened or you think he's still following
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:51.920]  through trump is definitely following through i don't think um people realize the severity of
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:55.600]  every single kinetic movement that's going on right now the kinetic momentum that is building
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.280]  worldwide worldwide is just it's very important and the only reason i'm making this call right now
[1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:06.800]  i'd usually kind of stay off some of this stuff because someone's kind of touchy um but uh you
[1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:10.880]  know i got friends who are there right now there's 30 000 us troops there right now they're sending
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:15.920]  pens there understand this in the united states army this weekend is a four-day weekend people are
[1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:21.520]  down people i mean we are on alert making no mistake but just generally when you have weekends
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:28.400]  like this forces are down you know people's awareness is down and i just i think something
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:32.000]  big is happening i think it's going to happen in the next 24 to 48 hours i'll leave it right there
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:37.280]  and it might come from the chinese um but make no mistake or be in coordination with us um
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:43.920]  um it's china south korea and the united states and they realize that finally the problem child
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:47.440]  has to someone finally has to you know have the intervention and fit them down
[1:04:48.320 --> 1:04:52.400]  and that's right and then we're back channel globalist traders helping north korea the whole
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:56.960]  time out of our country that's why china kind of let them do what they were doing wow powerful call
[1:04:56.960 --> 1:05:04.400]  thank you zack you've heard of vigilante justice right well now we have islamic sharia vigilantes

[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:53.200]  you about that some later and play some clips but things are really really really starting to get
[1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:59.040]  crazy and i know we're winning but i think as the caller said earlier because i was thinking
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:04.320]  about this morning i said i'm gonna go on air and i'm gonna say people want instant gratification
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:09.840]  from trump and we're 84 days in and he's already gotten more done than reagan ever did he's done
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:15.200]  some things i'm concerned about but he's not hillary clinton the globalists legitimately do not like
[1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:19.760]  him there's a civil war in the government about america taking america back it doesn't mean they're
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:24.800]  a bunch of angels at the pentagon and stuff that are in the civil war you just heard the guy earlier
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:27.920]  obviously calling from florida he knew what he was talking about by the way that was high level
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:32.800]  stuff i i'm you know i'd or say that info know that info but he was dead on and about the word
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.480]  that china is looking right now to strike north korea this weekend we're not saying that's gonna
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:41.680]  happen but that's where all this is going this is just an incredible time to be alive and i'm critical
[1:10:41.680 --> 1:10:48.320]  of trump and by being loyal opposition he listens to us and i'm just gonna leave it at that and he
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:53.920]  needs our support if they're smart enough to run us away and and have the media celebrate that everybody's
[1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:58.480]  you know going to turn on trump because he's shot some missiles at syria or whatever then there's a
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:04.000]  vacuum they come in they get control our enemies want us to turn on trump and people say oh you're
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.120]  just butt-kissing trump it's not about trump it's about the awakening it's about an anti-globalist
[1:11:09.120 --> 1:11:14.080]  president being successful so we need to criticize him when he's bad but go after him when he's uh
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:17.920]  you and and and supporting when he's doing good but i'm ranting like you're you're here to be
[1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:21.760]  interviewed what do you want to cover today well i want to cover there's a lot of things that can
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:27.040]  cover one is that just so your listeners not that they doubted that at all they know that this is
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:32.400]  where you get breaking news mcmaster has a plan to send in ground troops brown troops of syria
[1:11:32.400 --> 1:11:37.680]  that story actually broke here on info wars four or five days ago bloomberg is covering it so
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:42.480]  essentially whatever you're reading in the news today or tomorrow this is all going to be on info
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:48.880]  wars five 10 15 days before it ever reaches the mainstream that is how good the sourcing is here
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:53.840]  this is for real news fake news that is why not only are they trying to divide the base against
[1:11:53.840 --> 1:12:00.080]  trump they are now slandering alex and me and other patriots calling us russian agents claiming
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:05.920]  that a hashtag that i'd started after one of my callers suggested it was actually a russian
[1:12:05.920 --> 1:12:11.280]  operation so they realize that this is the only place for real news and now they're trying to attack
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:16.400]  and lie about us and claiming that we're russian agents and all that and we don't want to serve in
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.080]  bragg and say we're right we're right we're right they keep saying we're lying we're lying we're lying
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.760]  because weeks ago and then last week we said no mcmaster wants the troops that's my source
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:30.160]  from the white house and then you have your source he wants 150 000 on the ground now bloomberg comes
[1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:35.040]  out today and says trump has told bloomberg i don't want a war but it turns out the aides were
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.320]  doing exactly like we said trying to jockey and get them in place and move artillery in that wasn't
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:46.960]  for isis but was for Assad exactly so bloomberg is now reporting what we covered a week ago
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:52.480]  and what one thing that frustrates me a little bit is the idea that we need bloomberg to validate
[1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:57.280]  our reporting because this is real news we don't make stuff up like abc does like bloomberg does
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:01.200]  they fabricate things i put a transcript out of what the president said on monday it's what the
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:05.120]  president said and i'm not going to say where it came from everybody knows we have contact with the
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:10.000]  president the media's attacking that said oh look alex is making this up what i said it it came out
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:14.560]  three days later out of his mouth the exact same words right exactly and that has happened so many
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:18.880]  times now so yeah it isn't that we're bragging people say oh it's about ego it's not about ego
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:23.280]  but when every day you're called fake news you're lied about when you get things right you do have
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:28.080]  to remind people look watch what the fake news media is calling us watch what they're saying about us
[1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:33.520]  and they are so desperate for war now that they're trying to claim that us by trying to oppose a
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:40.240]  grand war in syria trying to save save american lives i mean alex when i did that live stream 11 hours
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:45.760]  so many mothers called in and said my son has ptsd this is so sad you know it was heartbreaking i
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:50.880]  could hardly even i could hardly even stay on the line it was so sad moms do not want to do another
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:55.040]  war they do not want the mcmaster plane to go through exactly and again we love our military
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:00.560]  we criticize the wars is because it's not for our national sovereignty it's not for our interest
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:05.440]  trump is doing limited things to build up the military in the eyes of the people to give them
[1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:11.360]  faith in that because the military's in an internal war with the globalist with the cfr and the pentagon
[1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:16.240]  is taught this now they know this this is out in the open this is even down to the enlisted people
[1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:20.960]  there's a civil war in america to restore the republic is our champion perfect absolutely not
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:26.000]  he can't even get people appointed in government because they are blocking him yeah they're blocking
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.480]  security clearances and that's kind of another point is a lot of the the media is trying to say
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:36.080]  that we are dividing dividing which trump the bases divided we're not divided no matter what
[1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:40.560]  trump does he has already been so fundamentally better we got a supreme court justice who's
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:45.360]  actually going to defend the constitution maybe not as good as glia but he's certainly going to be
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:49.200]  way better than anybody hillary clinton would have done hillary clinton wanted to shut down
[1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:54.480]  infill wars hillary infill war yeah you would not exist if hillary clinton were in office
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:58.320]  you would have federal agents kicking down the door deep state agents kicking down the door calling
[1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:03.280]  you god knows what they would frame you for crimes they're already trying right now even though
[1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:07.920]  hillary people are still there they're still operating like it's it's no big deal in fact i
[1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:12.160]  have confirmed that they've already had the attorney general have to stop several operations against us
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:15.680]  that are incredibly nasty and we're not here whining we want to fight with the globalists we
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.880]  want to beat them we just want you to know how serious this is you know it's funny you mentioned
[1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:22.880]  that let's pull up the economist article that attacked us now i'm told this is in the magazine
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:28.320]  as well this is one of the most elite publications published by the Rothschilds i mean you can't make
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:35.040]  that up and they literally say we're dupe idiots and Assad tells us what to say so now it's not
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:40.880]  just we're dupes of putin now it's a sod no no we said first on wednesday false flag we have the
[1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:46.400]  articles the history all of it you did as well then over the next week and a half everybody else
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:51.680]  from putin to ron paul everybody else came out instead was a false flag again we're the progenitors
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:58.080]  we're not here grabbing it you know from Assad oh look we're useful idiots right how a pair of
[1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:03.760]  self-publicists wound up as apologists for Assad we're not apologizing for Assad he didn't start
[1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:08.800]  the civil war six years ago he's never done anything to us and hillary and obama are we're
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:14.320]  trying to put al-qaeda in and and oh wiki leaks came out yesterday new wiki leaks hillary saying
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:18.480]  we're on the side of al-qaeda stop attacking him we already knew that in fact david night had
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:23.920]  to be over there please bring that in i mean this is so everything we say has just docked
[1:16:23.920 --> 1:16:29.360]  because we're going off what's already there and the sources we have because we've got sources
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.280]  i've got sources you've got sources you brought the susan rice said they're sitting on the story
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:38.400]  hour later they came out admitted it yep we're not making up these sources no there's patriots
[1:16:38.400 --> 1:16:43.280]  and that's what a lot of people gotta understand is that there are patriots and the patriots know
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:47.680]  that they can go to fearless people like alex jones that the stories are going to get out there
[1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:52.880]  so that is why i tell people to be hopeful and don't believe that the deep state is evil the deep
[1:16:52.880 --> 1:16:57.520]  state is evil but don't get me wrong there are people fighting it there are good people inside
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:02.480]  who want the truth to get out and are opposed to the bad stuff and the big story there's a civil war
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:08.160]  in the deep state exactly and the big story that we had talked about is that the security
[1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:12.320]  clearances are being held that's why people have to have reason less than you were breaking that two
[1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:17.280]  weeks ago and now it's in the news they're using security clearances what's great is though msm is
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:24.000]  so lazy they actually now go and grab our stories then they break them a week later whitewash but
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:28.960]  at least it gets out right right exactly so that's what people are saying now they just follow our
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:32.640]  twitter and they follow our websites and they rewrite it and they make up sources that actually
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:37.120]  don't even exist that they claim to have and and again it's true even when they bash us even when
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:42.000]  they attack us we can handle it but the sad thing is that somebody goes you know cernovich
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.200]  wise trump having a hard time finding good people look at what they do to alex and i if you don't
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:51.760]  know how to handle the media you have to be a professional to take on the fake news media you
[1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:57.280]  have to do this the average person when they get called horrible names or get called anti-semitic
[1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:02.160]  just out of the political sky every day for no reason like they're doing too spicy people buckle
[1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:06.480]  to that when you're in a hundred newspapers and they're saying you hate black people with no evidence
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:11.440]  a lot of people just roll over yeah the first time i mean you can relate to the first time you're
[1:18:11.440 --> 1:18:16.400]  attacked it does hurt the first time you're just you wake up and you look and there's all these nasty
[1:18:16.400 --> 1:18:21.440]  lies about you and people are asking you questions it does hurt but then you become stronger and
[1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:26.400]  overcome it but the most people who just want to work and serve in government they don't know how
[1:18:26.400 --> 1:18:30.320]  to handle it they're not prepared for it psychologically and they don't know how bad and what helps you
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:33.680]  i mean that you've been a lawyer and a filmmaker and a father i mean i mean why do you have that
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:39.760]  tenacity well the way i look at it is that if somebody has to fight and i know that if they're
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:44.560]  hitting us it is because they fear us so every time they hit me yeah every time they hit me i'm
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:49.280]  like hyped i'm like they're lying about me again people go why don't you sue abc and i go i love
[1:18:49.280 --> 1:18:53.280]  it when they lie about me i love it when they attack me when they hate on me because that means
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:58.240]  they fear me because the economist takes their orders from the ross child family so we are literally
[1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:03.680]  being attacked by the ross child and i'm wrong oh i feel great i love it knowing that that is the
[1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:07.680]  level of resistance we're getting because that's the kind of impact we're having so that is what
[1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:11.840]  i focus on is the rock why do you think they're focusing on us because they figured out we our
[1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:15.360]  phones are tapped they admit that we're under criminal investigation being a russian agent
[1:19:15.360 --> 1:19:19.360]  so they can have all the spying and then trump stops that investigation looks like oh he's covering
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:22.960]  up i'm just like fine spy on me i haven't done anything but it's just why do you think they're
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:26.800]  attacking us so much because it was drugs they would want i mean they want to get rid of him period
[1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:30.480]  and then it was ban and i guess they think they're winning with him now it's us well i'll tell you
[1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:34.400]  why this happened on the airplane i was sitting down holding my daughter my wife's next to me
[1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:38.720]  and a man walks on the plane and he looks at me goes mike cernovich and i said yeah and he goes
[1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:44.080]  thank you and shakes my hand that is why we're recognized everywhere every time you go out people
[1:19:44.080 --> 1:19:48.560]  like alex jones i love what you do i love what you do i was doing a periscope from the sky lounge
[1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:53.360]  this was live and as i'm doing it somebody in there goes hey i was actually watching your periscope

[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:24.080]  as well info wars.com is the site but you were getting into your sources clearly you were saying
[1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:30.240]  there is a neocon PR launch that happened a few weeks ago I see it everywhere the bots the sock
[1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:36.160]  puppets the lies the total demonization so I want you to briefly speak to that but here's the goodness
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:42.480]  the system so discredited and MSM so discredited when ABC news comes out two nights ago with a big
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:48.880]  piece saying we're I forgot to mention that you reminded me that we're literal agents of Assad
[1:24:48.880 --> 1:24:52.880]  then the economist backs off and says no we're useful idiots that's better it's too cool to
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:57.520]  actually be secret agents of Assad when I'm just a secret agent of freedom and don't want our
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:03.840]  government backing al Qaeda taking over a Christian nation and murdering everyone see how's that sound
[1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:10.480]  yeah a seven figure so I can report this a seven figure contract by the neocons has gone out on us
[1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:14.560]  where they're discrediting us I'm sure you've gotten nasty emails from people about making stuff
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:19.680]  up about me and everything so what they do now is whenever for campaigns yeah whenever I go anywhere
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:23.120]  suddenly people are like email and Alex Jones and saying can you believe this can you believe that
[1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:27.440]  starting two weeks ago I have reporters following me from my house everywhere they've got like six
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:32.240]  guys on me no yeah they follow you and that is because that seven figure contract went out
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:36.000]  and that is why if you read your twitter notifications now every half of them are now
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:40.960]  are like trashing you well those are all fake those are all pr firms it's the same David Brock
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:44.560]  Soros and they're creating the illusion that we've lost support and we're bad just like they're
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.440]  creating the illusion hey Trump's hold everybody out why are you for him you sell out right exactly
[1:25:49.440 --> 1:25:53.920]  so what they're doing is they're trying to discredit us amongst people by having these sock puppets
[1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:57.280]  they'll look the people have turned on Alice the people have turned on Cernovich and by the way
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:02.480]  they admit they have these sock puppets then they claim Trump and that we have sock puppets right but
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:07.200]  it's been Trump wouldn't spend money on those no he has a general public promoting him we've never
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:10.960]  used a sock puppet explain what those are people don't know they've been around 15 years yeah so the
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:15.120]  sock puppet account is you go and you go you usually outsource it to india or the philippines
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:19.200]  or something and you have people managing 100 twitter accounts and that's why the english is
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:24.640]  always doesn't make sense right it's like you'll be anti-jewel you you screw your mommy right so
[1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:29.040]  they put they put them in these boiler room style things these big bullhorns and you got you know
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:32.720]  hundred people in a room and each has a hundred sock puppets and they have different pictures
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:37.280]  that's right because this is cute what you're saying a hundred guys in a room called a bullhorn
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:41.840]  this is all admitted so now they have shows like homeland where i run a bullhorn right we don't have
[1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:47.440]  a bullhorn but see see again they invert right exactly so everything that they accuse us of
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:52.080]  doing they're actually doing the the funny thing is i've never even actually bought an ad in my life
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:56.320]  so i've never even bought a facebook ad let alone am i gonna buy by bought ads for products to fund
[1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:01.040]  ourselves they banned those yeah exactly so we're not even allowed to advertise on google right
[1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:04.880]  exactly so that so that's what cracks me up so we're like banned from the internet except for
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:10.080]  our own websites well and that is why obama you know that is big picture because we're already banned
[1:27:10.080 --> 1:27:13.840]  down to this and we're still killing them well exactly right but let's just know we're like
[1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:18.960]  winning winning the war but our we've got our gun emplacements winning for everybody out there
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:22.960]  in the distance but our own emplacements being overrun oh well that is why obama signed over
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:27.440]  control of domain names to the un what they're eventually going to say is info wars dot com is
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:32.480]  a hate domain and therefore they'll miss you from that came out of the wiki link saw us yeah exactly
[1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:36.320]  so that's the big game plan is like well we can cut off your advertising we cut off this we cut off
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:42.160]  that well wait but people are still sharing info wars dot com people realize that there's a red alert
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:46.400]  all hands on deck share that link everywhere then they go well ban them from facebook well you still
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:51.920]  can't shut them down what do you got to do well info wars dot com is a hate domain so we need to
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:55.760]  delist that from the internet domain registry and then that is how they take you from the internet
[1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:59.360]  that's why obama signed over control of that that's what the un said they're going to do
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:03.680]  right hillary was going to come in as you said and it announced that they were going to discredit
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:09.600]  the right forever and ban us and fix everything and it didn't happen i would i'll be completely
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.160]  honest i would not be in america and i've talked to other very very high level people who said that
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.000]  if hillary clinton won we would have to leave america i would not be in america right now i
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.120]  would just i would have to be gone your you would not be info wars dot com would not even exist on
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:26.640]  the internet the they would have filed a case against you in the un and the un would have
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:30.880]  completely removed your domain that was how disastrous and catastrophic and by the way people
[1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:35.040]  say oh sorry about fake news what you're saying as a lawyer i've read all the wiki links it's there
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:40.400]  and their admissions that's exactly what they were saying remember her dark heart speech exactly
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:45.440]  exactly so they attack you and from an internet perspective that's what you do take the domain
[1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:50.480]  off that's what people don't realize is you might own the domain info wars dot com but if the un
[1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:55.120]  classifies that as a hate domain then that can be completely removed off the internet they won't let
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:00.320]  you own it they'll sign that over to the Haitian government or the un and by the way you know we
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:05.120]  talked about this before another source i i hate to claim credit and or on behalf of myself or
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:11.920]  jones for such a trap tragic story but we reported about how the un in Haiti would buy children and
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:17.360]  sources from the military from his and mine you could watch them hand children over the barb wire
[1:29:17.360 --> 1:29:21.200]  well that big story just broke about the un and how they were with thousands of kids and the murder
[1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:26.160]  kids up what we sent a plane there we covered it we broke it all exactly where's our Pulitzer prize
[1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:31.600]  and we're not here saying we're so great they're shutting us down because if they could shut down
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:36.720]  a matt drudge or an alex jones or mike sternovich they can get everybody we'll be back i promise
[1:29:36.720 --> 1:29:44.560]  we're going directly to connor motto craig anthony janet and others 800 25 at 99 231 we'll talk about

[1:30:16.400 --> 1:30:21.280]  in his area he's been telling people in the cedar riverside some molly dominated neighborhood not to
[1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:26.080]  drink use drugs or interact with the opposite sex if he sees muslim women that he believes are

[1:33:17.920 --> 1:33:26.640]  uh i got something that tells me what it's all about i got some and i'm super bad
[1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:32.960]  i got some all right i'm getting these five six callers that hold the longest out of the way
[1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:35.760]  i really want to hear what they have to say that one call earlier was on for like 10 minutes because
[1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:41.680]  he was so powerful this is out of the hill obon reportedly spending a month in french
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:47.040]  polynesia where there's no criminal extradition to the united states and that it's funny they
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:51.200]  bruce brought that to me because the word is trump had tried to get them to just back off
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:56.720]  go into abstention like napoleon and just stop it but they won't stop they know the deep state
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:01.280]  came out in the news they said they were planning to overthrow trump and so little birdies have told
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:06.720]  me and then trump came out on air two days ago in fox business and said you know she's guilty
[1:34:06.720 --> 1:34:11.040]  hillary and she should be criminally gone after so certainly which is briefly because i want to go
[1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:14.560]  to these calls here what you have to say to the callers as they've been patient uh what what a
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:19.680]  little birdie's telling you i've i've heard the same thing and that's another story that i'm
[1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:24.240]  there's a lot of stories that i'm sitting on because some of the stuff that i know and that you
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.400]  know too we get called conspiracy theorists in light about all the time even though our news is
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:32.640]  reported so yeah there's a lot of really funny business going on with obama but if we set it
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:36.640]  right now on air we would be so attacked and it wouldn't even be worth it but there's some real
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:42.560]  shady things going on with obama right now and where's michelle obama you know he openly funded
[1:34:42.560 --> 1:34:47.680]  the arab spring yeah they were well they think of how ballsy it was six years ago with google and
[1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:51.840]  facebook and they all went to that big hotel north of london where they had bilderberg the next year
[1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:55.680]  this was in the news later and organized the arab spring and the overthrow of all these
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:35:01.360]  secular governments and blowing up churches and he actually his family laundered the money in
[1:35:01.360 --> 1:35:05.840]  and it all came out in court it's like you gotta actually hand it to him and he actually tried an
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:11.200]  islamic jihad takeover with merkel opening the borders bringing them all in i hear people like
[1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:16.800]  horror would say that uh you know 15 years ago i thought he was crazy and he's completely
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:20.080]  abandoned his daughter who's making her rounds through the new york party center shaking her
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:24.720]  ass on tv and the drugs and everything like remember when jenna bush went out and drank a
[1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:29.040]  little bit of beer i think actually in austin texas in the world yeah but you know obama's
[1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:32.880]  basically an absentee father abandoned a lot of sad things a lot of sad things going on there
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:39.040]  the word is those aren't even kids i've heard that too but it's these people are total cutouts
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:45.280]  well they're they're manufactured because that is why the deep state wanted him in that's why they
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:49.840]  want to mitt romney and that's why they they freaked out so badly about trump is and and we
[1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:54.320]  talked about staying out of the us right as they moved right over through trump right exactly and
[1:35:54.320 --> 1:35:59.120]  by the way i do want to get something on the record we talked about it on break which is that
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  i will never turn on trump i might become apathetic maybe but i'm i still am pro trump i'll never
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:10.720]  turn on him because what he has done has been so far way better than anything hillary clinton
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:14.480]  ever could have done and you know alex says the same thing so anybody telling you that that i've
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:19.680]  turned on donald trump is of course a complete liar well i put a joke video out saying in piece
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:24.400]  trump and people are like saying it's serious in the first minute i say you know i guess let's
[1:36:24.400 --> 1:36:27.520]  impeach him because he did all these great things all right let's go to the phone calls here
[1:36:28.160 --> 1:36:31.280]  let's go ahead and talk to connor in new york thanks for holding your own the air
[1:36:31.280 --> 1:36:38.240]  hey alex how you doing i'm a first-time caller i uh first want to offer you an apology i uh was
[1:36:38.240 --> 1:36:42.400]  never a fan of yours when i was growing up i was i grew up on michael savage i always bought into
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:49.040]  the conspiracy theorist line um but over the last year and a half i've kind of woken up to that next
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:55.920]  level i'm full boron listening every day you're the man so thank you um i'm a little nervous hi to
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:01.840]  mike too um my point is i think trump left a little bit of a a hint for us during the campaign
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:07.760]  if you listen to his exit music for every rally it was you can't always get what you want by the
[1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:14.080]  rolling stones and so everyone's in the midst of freaking out they're like oh my god he's not doing
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:20.720]  exactly what you get what you need and which is a country again exactly trump's not perfect but you
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:27.520]  know what america's gonna run this now yeah power to the people yeah and so now he's they're they're
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:30.960]  mad that he's kind of you know they're saying he's cozying up with china look what he did to mark
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:34.880]  rubio look what he did to these other people he told ram paul he had a horrible haircut during the
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:40.960]  primary he called marco little marco and then once he got on top and won the primary all marco's a
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:46.320]  great guy ram paul we're gonna go golf we're gonna work together so yeah he talked hard about china
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:52.000]  and he's still going to be tough on china when he needs to but you know he establishes his dominance
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:57.680]  that's his psychology he gets the dominance over the other people and then brings them in in a
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:03.680]  in a somewhat softer manner and so if he's got to work with the chinese a little bit on north korea
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:09.040]  so be it well yeah you have to be in the room yeah that's exactly right which is you have to be
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:12.640]  in the room and it's frustrating people say well why is he working with the chinese well because
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:17.600]  you you have to be in the room as much as i loathe obama and maybe hillary clinton if they had said
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:22.560]  hey we need a panel on people to talk about free speech i would go in that room even though i didn't
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:26.000]  like these people because if you're not in the room you have no influence well they were incredibly
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:29.680]  lazy too look how much he's working but here's the deal china's the second biggest economy in the
[1:38:29.680 --> 1:38:34.960]  world maybe the first china he got china to raise their currency and ours is gone almost up too high
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:39.120]  and people go oh he's flip-flopping now that he doesn't want them to raise their currency
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:46.160]  they did it we won so they're calling him having big wins they're calling wins flip-flops and then
[1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:50.960]  i'm sorry but spicer you know is a smart guy i'm sure but when he got asked about these economic
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:55.360]  things trump did he went i've deferred to trump i don't understand all that yellen's doing what he
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:00.000]  says now the chinese are doing what he says now it's totally different yeah so so those aren't
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:04.880]  flip-flops that's him coming with a hard negotiating stance and then he gets part of what he wants
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:09.360]  yeah that this the same way that you and i are pushing back against the ground war in syria
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:13.360]  it doesn't mean that we flip-flopped it doesn't mean that we oppose trump we're just saying hey
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:17.760]  there's a negotiation going on too even between us and the president of the united states if he's
[1:39:17.760 --> 1:39:22.800]  pushing too far we're going to push back that is the way adults behave but the fake news media
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:27.040]  tries to infantize people and make they trained me babies that if somebody doesn't do what you
[1:39:27.040 --> 1:39:32.720]  want the first time or the media misrepresent you just a man and throw away you know your your
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:37.440]  whole future and leave the sandbox take your toys and go away well by leaving the sandbox
[1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:41.520]  folks you're not in the game right exactly you're going to take blows and the media they're even
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:45.760]  trying to do that with ban banning by drumming up a lot of drama and over exaggerating and everything
[1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:51.040]  is they want to get banned and fired up and trump fired up to divide them but the reality is for
[1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:55.760]  everybody listening in real life you got to be in the room with people you don't agree with you got
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:00.000]  to push but you people are going to push back and you find some kind of reconciliation that's
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.960]  called being in a democracy and it's called living in a big world that's right what are you and we're
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:07.840]  going to go back to calls thank you Connor great point what do you think just briefly of Jared
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:11.440]  Kushner because i don't want to just sit there and demonize the guy but they say he's basically
[1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:15.440]  taking over a lot of foreign policy they're setting up be the next president he's 35 years old hey
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:21.360]  that's fine but he was given his matt his newspaper by his dad he was given his he's failing at this
[1:40:21.360 --> 1:40:25.440]  building he's got and again i'm not trying to alienate him but i'm not here kissing the president's
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:31.280]  butt either if this guy was a big winner and not just a pretty boy then i wouldn't have an issue
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:35.760]  and he's a democrat and so i get the fact that it's obviously the national security council
[1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:40.720]  that's trying to manipulate trump that's now been confirmed our sources are right besides they go
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:44.880]  at least in my case i don't know some of your sources but they're obviously excellent so i'm
[1:40:44.880 --> 1:40:50.320]  not going to war with kushner i don't want to it's just the stuff i heard about him in the campaign
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:54.400]  that he's easily influenced he goes and meets with the head of google and others
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:40:59.280]  where is kushner calling for them to get off the backs of the republican conservative libertarian
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:05.040]  nationalistic media that put trump in can't trump see he's having his base cut away right so there's
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:09.360]  three teams and we may have talked about this a couple weeks ago before the media even knew about
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:14.080]  this kind of infighting again we talked about all the infighting months ago yeah exactly so again
[1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:18.960]  like they're catching up to us wow welcome to you again they're mirroring exactly what roger stone
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:22.800]  and i and others said because we really have the sources right so they're three teams i knew about
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:28.240]  flin and the turkey deal yep when he was first just involved in the campaign i knew all about it
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:33.680]  the news just started reporting in a month ago right exactly so the thing is there are three
[1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:43.120]  teams team one are the real patriots don jr steven miller steve bannon kelly and conway those are
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:47.600]  the people in the white house who really really believe in america and love america team two are
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:54.160]  the saboteurs paul ryan rents previs and to a large degree shon spicer shon spicer was brought in by
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:59.120]  rents previs shon spicer shouldn't have the job i probably shouldn't be attacking the press secretary
[1:41:59.120 --> 1:42:03.200]  but you know what is a journalist it's my job oh he should have just said trump's following through
[1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:07.520]  on his promises read the details of the executive orders or where he stands on currency he didn't
[1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:11.760]  even know that'd be the first question they did they did what they they raised their currency
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:15.120]  they're starting to capitulate on trade deals trumps had him with a bunch of executive orders
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:19.360]  and stuff they didn't do so carrot stick he had him with a carrot and a stick he's winning
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:24.720]  spicer took a win and turned it into a loss sorry exactly and that is in my opinion his head's not
[1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:29.920]  the game it's deliberate sabotage team three is avonka and kushner they are very social and what
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:35.680]  the gop elite and the globalists have learned is hey let's where's the hip pieces on jared kushner
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:41.040]  hey let's soften him up let's get his ear let's influence him let's influence avonka that is why
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:46.800]  the media is actually quit they quit attacking avonka like they used to because they realize now
[1:42:46.800 --> 1:42:50.480]  they're the people that can be influenced so kushner avonka they want what's best
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:55.680]  for president trump but they're being lied to a manipulated and being used by the globalist so
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:43:01.280]  kushner is not a saboteur he's not what i consider a bad guy but kushner is being manipulated
[1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.480]  useful idiot forces so i'm saying he's an idiot but from their perspective he's a useful idiot
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:13.200]  that's how they're using and it just hit me our heads are in the game anybody that wants to study
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:17.600]  geopolitics the world this is all out there the reason we give out all this info that turns us
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:23.520]  to be right it's already there it's just that media mainstream only goes with big themes and
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:28.240]  whatever they're told to push so they're always busy pushing the last piece of garbage while we're
[1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:32.320]  here looking at congress looking at statements talking to experts looking at factoids we know
[1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:36.480]  the real agenda but they don't want you looking at it's all there because if you ever start looking
[1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:40.400]  at the big agenda you'll be better than us in understanding where it's going once you take
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.040]  the blinders off in their little virtual reality you go whoa what's that it's the grand canyon
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:49.920]  once you're seeing it for yourself you're like oh you didn't like just imagine all this and it came
[1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:54.960]  true you didn't have blinders on that's all it is our heads in the game folks that's all it is
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:59.120]  well we live for this and i'm going to tell you a story that might seem small but it blew my mind
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:04.640]  so you were at the rnc you know where i saw you i saw you at every protest i saw you with the people
[1:44:04.640 --> 1:44:08.560]  i saw you attacked actually by black lives matter i watched when they assaulted you as you had your
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:13.520]  megaphone you know where the fake news media was inside the air conditioning that is what they do i
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:18.400]  went to the dnc the democrat national committee i marched with the protesters from city hall in
[1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:24.000]  philadelphia franklin delinor park i walked 10 miles all day covering all the protests 100 degree
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:29.920]  heat right i lost five pounds in water weight i didn't see anybody from a mainstream outlet abc
[1:44:29.920 --> 1:44:36.240]  wasn't there nowhere yeah they're inside talking they grab our clips cut them up and use that as
[1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:40.720]  their crew exactly it doesn't even have reporters in the field anymore they do it all with just
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:45.520]  photos taken by local people they stand behind the green screen exactly i saw info wars was at
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:51.200]  every protest you had coverage there what they do is they want to sit inside and drink hot chocolate
[1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:57.280]  and the air conditioning with all the fancy people and clean glasses but that is that's not the game
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:02.560]  there's journalism exactly the fun and excitement is in the street yeah i love i love it when i go
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:07.600]  out and i saw somebody actually they were lighting a flag on fire a person stepped on if they got
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:11.040]  started on fire that was job eggs one of our reporters so these are the kind of things that
[1:45:11.040 --> 1:45:16.000]  we see all the time every day and that's what a lot of people realize is that the the fake news
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:20.640]  media they don't do journalism they sit around and they wait to get an email and this is exactly
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:24.800]  people keep asking how we break so much and how you and others and drugs everybody does
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:28.960]  because we're we're actually in the real world right we don't come out here and say we have
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:32.640]  all the answers or this is how it is or that's how it is the media always acts like they know
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:36.480]  exactly what's going on i'll get up here for a week and say what do you think's going on audience
[1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:41.360]  yeah and our network of sources is so big too and that's what people don't realize is do you know
[1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:46.080]  how many how many military people read alex jones and how many military people read me we have
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:52.080]  everybody from you know privates of basic training to generals who are passionate about this stuff
[1:45:52.080 --> 1:45:56.240]  and that's because they know it's an info war is going on exactly and we're not afraid to work
[1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.480]  hard we're passionate people go people say oh my god alex jones is this yeah we're hyped we're
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:04.800]  excited sorry we love what we do and we love to hit it hard and we love to be first the fake news
[1:46:04.800 --> 1:46:08.800]  media they're dead they're lifeless when you look exactly if you're gonna go up against these criminals
[1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:12.320]  they're gonna try to destroy you better have some energy you better be behind a fight folks this is
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:15.840]  the fight i'm gonna go back to the calls and again this more and more this is not about us talking about
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:21.760]  ourselves we have to say who we are right because a thousand publications a week literally say what
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:26.800]  we aren't exactly so i have to stand up next to the body snatcher that the msm is saying this is
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:31.120]  alex jones or this is mike cernovich or this is matt drudge or this is michael sabbage or this is
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:38.960]  whoever standing up i have to stand say no this is who i am this is what i said but again they're
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:46.240]  so scared let's go to janet then we're gonna go to uh motto and anthony and arena and craigs
[1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:50.080]  so i'm gonna try a bit quicker now janet in missouri you're on the air with mike cernovich go ahead
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:59.200]  hi how are you guys doing good thanks for calling um well first i want to say i'm a democrat and a
[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:04.640]  liberal i didn't vote for trump but this isn't gonna be one of those calls um
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:14.080]  um with the whole situation with north korea and the bomb in syria i see you know a lot of people
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:19.920]  claiming they're you know liberals on quote unquote my side or whatever saying you know
[1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:24.640]  that it's terrible and you shouldn't do it we shouldn't get involved well with the north korea
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:30.240]  situation you know i'm inclined to agree but at the same time he's saying he's gonna nuke us
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:37.760]  exactly that's a great point because i don't want to be militarized militaristic the global
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:41.680]  challenges have been set up at the present if he doesn't act strong things are gonna get out of
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:45.760]  control i agree you can go too far north korea they're firing missiles at japan they're threatening
[1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:52.080]  to attack our fleets china's sick of it and so now the word is china may strike so this is a very
[1:47:52.080 --> 1:47:56.800]  dangerous time but but i mean i hear you i i mean i mean what do you think what do you think mike
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:01.920]  what do you think janet yeah there's a lot of people concerned with north korea and i've a friend
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:07.360]  of mine who has a lot of good sources said it's a pretty big deal my sources i haven't heard anything
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:13.440]  big on north korea our military sources say if kim jong-un makes one wrong move or i mean the the
[1:48:13.440 --> 1:48:17.440]  chinese are looking at me fires that missile to hit them themselves well and that is why you know
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:20.960]  trump met with china and that's what a lot of people got to realize is people need to be big
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:26.640]  picture thinkers which is you let up on trade a little bit with china china has 3000 years of
[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:30.560]  war with korea right exactly well that's the thing a lot of people don't understand too about
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:34.720]  any politics is yeah people think oh they're all asians over there or whatever this is a very
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:39.680]  big and stereotypical view that the fake news has they're actually very nationalistic a korean is a
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:44.000]  korean a chinese they're saying i'm chinese chinese japanese absolutely hate you yeah the rape of
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:48.880]  nanking there there's all this ethnic genocide that has happened they've all had wars right exactly
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:54.240]  so china will go to war with korea no problem if it's in their best interest to do it and and and
[1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:58.240]  like the military and intel guy could tell you it was an intel right down there at the uh
[1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:03.440]  at the special operations command they all know the score the cfr and the globalist sold us out to
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:07.760]  korea north korea they gave them all the weapons and the rest of this so that they could have their
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:13.120]  little you know diplomatic manipulation behind the scenes between china and the us so that this
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:18.000]  group of bureaucrats and politicians behind the scenes could manipulate through their sources
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.440]  and dictate to china and japan and and and that's just done and trump said let's just end this
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:28.320]  but no more japan's really passed let's just do you tell him stop it or he's dead in japan and china
[1:49:28.320 --> 1:49:33.840]  said okay we'll kill him right because you stand down we're gonna nuke him yeah and here's the deal
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.800]  i mean china is ready they are ready to take out north korea right now and and especially if it's
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:42.560]  leveraged with trump if we get what we want from north korea then we got to give him we got to take
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:47.120]  it again that is what people got to see about plus they raised their currency anyway so we we had
[1:49:47.120 --> 1:49:51.120]  our cake and ate it too right and then and then the bots are like oh you're selling out he didn't
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:57.040]  he didn't stop the currency manipulation they did what we wanted i love how they transmute
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:01.440]  winning and losing but that's what they're always going to do and you know bigger picture is why
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:06.480]  shone spice are not aggressive why is trump's media team not aggressive what would happen to trump if
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:10.960]  you didn't exist if a few other people didn't exist trump has a media team why isn't this message
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:15.360]  getting out what the heck are they doing there well it's they're totally ignoring they sabotage
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:19.280]  him he's figured that out they just ignore what he says and do whatever they want because they come
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:24.800]  out of the swamp but then no one knows how to run the swamp with the swamp it's a it's a it's a it's
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:29.280]  literally insane yeah so the the media team there's been deliberate sabotage within the media team
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:34.320]  within messaging that a lot of what appears to be incompetence is actually underhand sabotage
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.640]  recurring in the media team it's unbelievable it is jan and thank you so much hey we're not
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:42.640]  democrats or republicans we just know trump wants to actually be the president of america that means
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:46.640]  perfect but this is like we're getting our hands back on the wheel and it might be a little bumpy

[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:53.920]  committed i have dreams about it it's all i want is to stop these people right that's and you are
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:57.520]  the power of info wars that's what we're kind of going off of us today because we're under attack
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:02.000]  what are we supposed to do right that i wish that i didn't have to do news i wish i didn't have to do
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.920]  journalism i could just hang out with my kids that i didn't wake up but i didn't have people saying
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:10.080]  okay you're now called a russian propaganda agent you're called a spy you're called a which is an
[1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:16.000]  insult i think about vaccine waters got up and said putin's telling him on the phone this is a
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:20.480]  quote what to say drain the swamp quick and hillary that came from putin that's how he gets these
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:26.560]  out as if donald trump couldn't come up with that i mean it's this insult like i'm not saying russians
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:33.600]  are stupid there's but like russians are telling me what to do yeah or a side right exactly and
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:39.360]  the connections now they're making are so tenuous where if you ever went to a korean spa or something
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:43.280]  you know or some kind of turkish bath then suddenly you're a spy and that's why you notice
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:48.640]  none of these stories actually connect any real dots they'll say oh he met with russian people
[1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:53.120]  well no kidding russians are everywhere russians live in america russian american right here is
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:59.200]  she evil right the hotel clerk that i checked in at the hotel she was russian when i was in dc i
[1:57:59.200 --> 1:58:04.160]  was at asana oh my god two russians in there oh what happened in dc i promise we're going to one
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:10.240]  minute break and we're right back to your calls but i i i i was in dc and they were like russian
[1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:14.560]  women trying to talk to me russian men it's dc and i caught myself looking for cameras i wouldn't
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:18.240]  even talk to him and then later i went you know ought to just fly to russia ought to go do russian
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:22.880]  tv ought to go the other direction so the intimidation and just you know what i mean because it gets
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:27.360]  the point like you know i'm talking to a russian am i even allowed to do this it's like it's like
[1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:31.520]  what no i was nervous i was in the sauna and there were two russian girls in there and i thought
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:35.280]  i wonder if this is some kind of spy thing or something going on and then i had the same
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:39.680]  realization i said i'm just gonna go to st petersberg and take a selfie there and you know flip people

[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:29.520]  air with mike sternovich and alex jones gab mcginnis will be co-host someone who's coming up the next
[2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:38.480]  segment go ahead hello yes sir welcome thank you for holding yes um i'd like to say on the
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:44.640]  stereo thing i think it was a brilliant strategic move on his part to launch those strikes with
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:51.600]  the chinese communist leader there is to show that he needs business and i also think that um i have a
[2:00:51.600 --> 2:00:58.480]  strong suspicion that there is a point and as it refers to syria there's a point he won't go beyond
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:03.520]  because he could have easily bombed a thug's house or whatever and killed some of his family but he
[2:01:03.520 --> 2:01:10.960]  i think he um he knows he knows what he knows where to draw the line um no i agree i don't
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:15.040]  like to be machiavellian or double minded but i can see how that all worked out they didn't
[2:01:15.040 --> 2:01:18.480]  give up the chemicals like they said they were they didn't use them was obviously a false flag
[2:01:18.480 --> 2:01:22.880]  so they were gonna say trump hadn't done anything oh she's with russia and syria and said okay i blew
[2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:26.960]  up this empty depot and then they all have to grovel well i mean he had to do that it was
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:31.520]  scott adams actually who was a brilliant commentator and said that too which is scott adams you
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:36.000]  and me anybody who's intelligent knows that Assad would not have gassed his own people when he had
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:40.880]  their strategic advantage but if everybody's in this collective zombie mind control thing
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:45.360]  then you still have to react to the lie even though you know it's a lie so you so what you do is you
[2:01:45.360 --> 2:01:49.680]  tell russia and Assad you say look i know that this is a setup by the fake news media what are you
[2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:54.640]  gonna do i have to bomb this airfield and then i even knew before i even talked to the liehouse
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:58.160]  because i don't know how trump's brain works now you didn't get the chemicals out there at that base
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:03.360]  i'm gonna go ahead and hit that get them out so they don't go everywhere and and then you know we'll
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:09.440]  all move forward exactly so that is why that's what a lot of people don't realize is trump knows
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:14.320]  that Assad didn't gasses on people but if everybody is such an zombie mind that they believe it then
[2:02:14.320 --> 2:02:17.840]  you have to just say okay this is what we live in it's not the perfect world and the communist
[2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:21.040]  chinese have been absolutely horrible they do terrible things their country's out of control
[2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:25.200]  they're they're president who is a dictator he's put in by the bullet bureau is more pragmatic
[2:02:25.200 --> 2:02:29.760]  the chinese are very pragmatic especially at this point and trump's very pragmatic just deal deal
[2:02:30.400 --> 2:02:34.480]  all your business with us we just got to have an economy if you didn't deal with us just stop
[2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:39.600]  grabbing everything stop being out of control you know our elite that's giving you all the power
[2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:44.400]  that's over but let's now have a double way street here two-way street and north korea's got to stop
[2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:48.400]  and china has come out and said absolutely they got to stop so we're going to see what happens
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:53.840]  very critical time though anthony in the next 24 hours because it's already what like 1 a.m
[2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:59.360]  in in in north korea and they're saying sometime today they plan to shoot missiles again at japan
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:02.640]  and detonate a nuclear weapon and trump may respond certainly which what do you think is going to
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:07.680]  happen the china thing i'm not sure the chinese are very practical people and like you said it's
[2:03:07.680 --> 2:03:11.920]  just a negotiation they got a little too greedy they realized they were a little bit too greedy
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:15.680]  and trump said we're not going to let you take it just like anything else you sell great products
[2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:20.800]  for your audience right at a fair price great quality stuff that is the fundamental basis for
[2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:25.680]  geopolitical affairs to china they do good things they do some you know sometimes they go a little
[2:03:25.680 --> 2:03:30.160]  bit too far so trump is saying hey we need to have more of a fair price it's more of an adult
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:35.280]  relationship and obama of course just let them do whatever they want to do so whatever china does
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:40.800]  is going to be intelligent strategic and it will be in america's best interests we've got shadow
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:46.080]  warrior who's an army vet for 35 years china north korea i promise i'll go to you i'm bad i get these
[2:03:46.080 --> 2:03:50.080]  great callers make them hold for an hour from now on john harman when somebody holds an hour they get
[2:03:50.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  a free t-shirt or a free bottle x2 or rain force like something's like a 30 dollar value 20 dollar
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:59.360]  value from a now on when the caller holds it to one hour john they they they they get something free
[2:03:59.360 --> 2:04:03.520]  all right awesome here and this gives you a bunch of work to do but i just am horrible about it
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:06.560]  but there's breaks i want to talk about i want to cover we got a bunch of clips coming up
[2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:12.720]  get them again as we're gonna get to a shadow warrior oh my gosh motto he's been holding forever

[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:29.280]  work with me i'll probably do it with them as well but my old syndicator but i want to put on a
[2:04:29.280 --> 2:04:33.200]  bunch of other shows for different talent different flair if i love hearing the other hosts on air
[2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:36.880]  that to me are more listenable and why everybody listens to me i don't know half the time i can't
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:40.720]  listen to myself and i don't say that it's self deprecating i mean i mean it so i look forward to
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:45.040]  get the best brains on air with the network that will work with gcm here in the next few months to

[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:38.400]  rude we apologize okay it's not much day so north korea is going to be big that they've got uh uh the
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:43.360]  american he's calling in all his guys there's really strange behavior going on i think there
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:47.920]  might even be a nuclear strike tomorrow to soul or tokyo and you know what happens when he tries
[2:10:47.920 --> 2:10:53.520]  that we're just going to make him explode and then also in berkeley uh lauren southern and a bunch
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:58.640]  of people are going down there to do a thing called patriots day nothing controversial
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:04.080]  just people said like trump wanting to say they love free speech in america and all these rodents
[2:11:04.080 --> 2:11:09.680]  these anti-fuck kids we they were just spotted at home depot buying uh wooden flagpoles because
[2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:14.320]  they want to extinguish all these people but they're going to meet up with bikers oathkeepers all
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:18.240]  these guys are there waiting for them and it's going to be a riot wow i forgot about that we
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:21.680]  should have a crew there i was going to send a crew to end culture but i forgot about this
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:26.000]  this is going to be pretty explosive with these little bullies oh no it's good i i had to choose
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:30.480]  between this or being and covering that and you know what a great life to have to make that choice
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:36.480]  but i almost went to berkeley wow but isn't it funny how mad these kids are like i could understand
[2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:41.760]  if you had some crazy eugenics theories about genocide you wanted to you know kill all these
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:47.280]  babies or you had some more threatening agenda but it's just basically a july fourth party
[2:11:47.280 --> 2:11:54.080]  and they want to shut it down what do you predict is going to happen i predict they're
[2:11:54.080 --> 2:11:59.200]  going to get overwhelmed these kids i don't know why they chose violence as their new language because
[2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:05.440]  they're all rich kids their sons of professors some of them are brainwashed losers with no parental
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:10.320]  guidance and these those two weak forces are going out there and you can tell when you see them in a
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:14.160]  fight they've never been there in a fight before and another funny thing they do is they put women
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:18.960]  in the front lines because these feminists have brainwashed themselves into thinking they can take
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:24.400]  any guy so they just get plowed they get beaten i mean they're like ices the way they use women
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:30.240]  as human shield you know i agree because i saw that in i saw that in dc for the inauguration
[2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:35.120]  women and runovers are attacking me and finally i said okay and i'll just start ramming them down
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:38.720]  then they scream i'm hitting a woman i'm like lady you're hitting me i'm trying to go in the
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:42.800]  entrance i was just forget it you got attacked there as well you got attacked at your own event
[2:12:42.800 --> 2:12:45.600]  but i've seen all these videos like you mentioned coming out when you've done it yourself
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:49.680]  where now we're just beating the hell out of these people i know and you feel bad
[2:12:49.680 --> 2:12:55.200]  at nyu we had a guy we call fryer tuck he's our biggest member of the proud boys and he's just
[2:12:55.200 --> 2:12:59.680]  plowing people and he's begging them to stop because he was a bouncer his whole life he just
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:02.800]  murders people for fun and he was going what is the matter with you guys
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:10.640]  and then i love how they'll hit you and then bitch when you punch them back or they run to the
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:22.880]  police actually well i like how they hide behind the police that's the best they all they're all
[2:13:22.880 --> 2:13:28.000]  cop haters their black lives matter that they hate the police but then i saw when gavin actually
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.520]  punched this guy i don't know if you guys have that footage loaded but there was a guy in new
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:36.160]  york i think it was in why you're maybe that a poor ball but he goes go get gavin so gavin goes
[2:13:36.160 --> 2:13:40.160]  well i'm right here he punches a guy and they tried to get the police after gavin i couldn't
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:46.480]  believe it let me ask you this though go ahead no go ahead gavin well they're so confident that
[2:13:46.480 --> 2:13:51.840]  we are the straw man of the nazis or whatever the hell we are so we're hitler so if you're
[2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:55.600]  going to kill hitler you feel confident about i mean the people talk about time traveling and
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:00.400]  killing a baby it's just it's the only murder that's totally acceptable so now that we're all hitler
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:04.960]  trump everyone literally the country's hitler they'll just be on their phone going yeah he's
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:08.720]  right here in front of me let's get him okay why don't you and you go i'm not going to sit here
[2:14:08.720 --> 2:14:17.440]  and watch you plan my attack it's crazy i used to have a movie come out tell folks about that uh
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:22.240]  it's not quite out yet i'm doing a movie of my book the death of cool we just had to shoot
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:27.120]  some pickups recently but it's it's we've done a little mini movie for every chapter in the book and
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:31.840]  it's a fun time no but what's your the movie i wanted to go see it but having a time we're
[2:14:31.840 --> 2:14:35.760]  we're we're you're uh we're gonna know you're gonna die now you're gonna be a you're gonna be a tough
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:39.440]  guy or whatever around like a man supposed to you're gonna show your son how you're supposed to act
[2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:45.760]  that's how to be a man and uh that's available on itunes i think it just left netflix but that's
[2:14:45.760 --> 2:14:50.800]  uh a video where i think i have breast cancer so i want to record all these lessons for my
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:55.920]  unborn son and uh we got up to all kinds of shenanigans but i like how you're actually
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:00.960]  doing that in the real world so the movie's kind of a gonzo type deal playing yourself
[2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:05.440]  yeah in a way i mean when you think about previous generations you'd be lucky if you had
[2:15:05.440 --> 2:15:10.480]  oh this is a letter my grandfather wrote to the newspaper and it's this coveted thing that you
[2:15:10.480 --> 2:15:15.600]  know you frame and now i don't think our kids would be ever be able to read all the stuff we
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:20.240]  wrote and all the videos we made and all the all the content it's like you don't have to die you
[2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:25.200]  can just to bring dad back from the grave every time you press play that's kind of a cool point
[2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:28.560]  Rick Herzwell believes from his letters and some of his dad's stuff he will bring him back with
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:33.360]  ayah computers that really isn't possible but if you have tens of thousands of hours of a
[2:15:33.360 --> 2:15:38.720]  Gavin McGinnis or a Mike Cernibus or whoever of a Donald Trump you kind of could bring them back
[2:15:38.720 --> 2:15:43.680]  with ai in a way couldn't you yeah especially with search features like say it's abortion or
[2:15:43.680 --> 2:15:49.200]  north korea or whatever you go wonder what my dad felt about this there's a video here's 200
[2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:56.800]  hours of north korea especially mike he's recording periscopes three times a day that you hear you
[2:15:56.800 --> 2:16:01.600]  see the guy making tea and feeding his baby and telling the world what's going to happen tomorrow
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:05.440]  and it's always right yeah what do you make of that because i don't want to talk about ourselves
[2:16:05.440 --> 2:16:08.400]  i'm gonna skip this break so we have more time pull up what you're talking about it's in the
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:12.400]  economist abc news i'm gonna make about myself but yeah people are almost family calls he goes
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:16.560]  how are you handling it are you really working for Assad i mean i've never been in the Middle East
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:21.840]  Assad all i said was i i don't like Assad i don't like al-qaeda our government started the war
[2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:26.240]  yeah there it is and their main twitter feed the conspiracy that the chemical weapons attack in
[2:16:26.240 --> 2:16:31.120]  Syria was a hoax and they're going to say these unamerican traders these useful idiots and so i
[2:16:31.120 --> 2:16:34.640]  don't know how i'm not supposed to talk about myself right so like you're watching this from
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:39.280]  they attack you plenty gabin as well trying to beat you up and kill you what is going on
[2:16:39.280 --> 2:16:43.680]  when we're all russian agents we're all i mean i support trump i get the missile attack made him
[2:16:43.680 --> 2:16:48.320]  look strong i'm just saying i don't believe the chemical attack was sassad because they've caught
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:52.560]  the rebels doing it before and they don't have any proof he did it i'm not even attacking trump
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:56.560]  in fact in the macky valley way i'm saying okay you blew up an empty airfield and shut them up about
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:00.480]  how your russian agent i kind of sickly support it i've admitted that kind of becoming like macky
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:05.600]  valley because now we've got a guy in there doing their own tricks against them but i'm just saying
[2:17:05.600 --> 2:17:11.040]  how do we know asad did it and now in newspapers everywhere i am an asad agent you are we we're
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:16.320]  together in this look at us we got the gather are you getting orders from asad yeah i was just
[2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:21.840]  talking to him on the phone right now he's actually here via skype on the other tv but my thing with
[2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:27.040]  that is i go i don't care i don't care if it was actors i don't care if they just had kids go like
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:33.280]  that the big picture is that the world saw a bad thing so the big man has to go boom
[2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:38.560]  on the bad thing and now women respect him here in america they go oh the patriarchy is back
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:43.520]  because we know feminists deep down want to pay for patriarchy obama's legacy is obliterated
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:48.320]  because he said he would draw a line in the sand and he got cucked so that's awesome he's killed as
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:53.680]  you say the russian theory i think the neocons even are getting too much hubris too confident
[2:17:53.680 --> 2:18:01.120]  they're going to be wiped out uh and the biggest picture is these terrorists are absolute animals
[2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:06.480]  they dismember our soldiers they tear out beating hearts and eat them they sell fingers
[2:18:06.480 --> 2:18:12.640]  and the button the market there for as war trophies there's literally a market for body parts
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:18.880]  just as accoutrements so we don't negotiate with them we don't send them democracy we just scare
[2:18:18.880 --> 2:18:25.040]  them with huge fireworks that was very well said i love the moab because not only is this a big
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:30.720]  message that hey we got the big guns on the eve of this one career thing that was a warren of
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:34.880]  a bunch of them that they killed who killed special forces going and just to get intel on them we're
[2:18:34.880 --> 2:18:40.720]  running about a syrian iraq like you said cleaning up obama's mess yeah they're now they dropped this
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:46.560]  20 something pound bomb and it kills them all i mean that that's a finally and then they say oh
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:51.120]  he wants a military dictatorship he says i've given them total authorization there was this
[2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:57.200]  to carry out his constitutional orders this micromanaging call obama's seat and he would
[2:18:57.200 --> 2:19:01.040]  never answer the phone sir we we have we have been locked in the sides we can't kill him
[2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:05.520]  oh you i mean this is crazy gavin what do you make of that i think we crippled our guys over
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:09.680]  there i was talking to terry shappard recently and i said how do we win this war and he goes
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:14.800]  let us do our job i mean right now they've got rpg's and they go we're getting shot at from a
[2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:19.200]  mosque what do we do and they've got a call up i talked to one vet who told me he said
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:23.680]  our guy had to pretend he misunderstood in order to save our lives because they were
[2:19:23.680 --> 2:19:27.520]  shooting from the mosque and the guy said don't shoot the mosque he said what was that what shoot
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:33.520]  the mosque oh what i took out the guys that were trying to kill them we've got to let these our
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:40.080]  dogs loose on these boys i want the terrorists to be going who who who who let the dogs out
[2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:45.760]  as we just roar through the middle east short sharp shock by the way i don't want to quagmire i
[2:19:45.760 --> 2:19:50.000]  want to know i'm going to get out and scare the crap out of them and trump doesn't want to quagmire
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:54.720]  and that's the problem i reported this last week i mean we have our sources directly to the man
[2:19:55.280 --> 2:19:59.760]  and no it's not going to happen no no fly zone we just got clean out all cut in ices like i
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:04.800]  promise but also be strong don't worry you know trust me and then boom days later he comes out
[2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:08.800]  gives that very speech saying it but then we learn his own generals they're not all bad but
[2:20:08.800 --> 2:20:12.560]  the masters and others they do want to take out a side because mcmasters is getting influenced by
[2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:18.080]  john mccain and others and he said i want to take out a sod and i want to take out al-qaeda
[2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:23.120]  well a sod didn't start a war and i'm not in love with a sod my point is we can't be on the job of
[2:20:23.120 --> 2:20:27.920]  regime change when they don't attack us right gavin yeah i like a long time ago you said look i'm
[2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:31.840]  supporting trump but if he does something wrong if he starts attacking free speech we will drag
[2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:38.720]  him out of the white house by his heels was your the way you put it and if we see more jared kushner
[2:20:38.720 --> 2:20:44.240]  uh getting in there getting turning our our administration neocon you know more nicky hailey
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:50.560]  saying we have to depose a sod more quagmire crap then i'm gonna drag him out by his heels
[2:20:50.560 --> 2:20:56.000]  but right now i'm i am banking on optimism and i just see it as a giant fireworks display
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:01.280]  and then we also have by the way secretary of state is saying our priorities ices not deposing
[2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:06.240]  a sod and nicky hailey what is she she's the un ambassador the un is theatrics it's just hollywood
[2:21:06.240 --> 2:21:11.920]  it doesn't have and we just cut their funding by 50 percent don't you love don't you love trump
[2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:19.440]  cutting their funding i love it i the un is a fifth column it is an enemy of ours that is all in the
[2:21:19.440 --> 2:21:26.000]  western world but determined to depose all of the western world they are bad news it's a vestigial
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:32.480]  globalist dog that doesn't hunt it's like a it's like something really pathetic turn the
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:36.320]  fish i want to take a few calls we jump in here i'm i was i mean the un i think is far no far
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:41.360]  nefarious i think it's how the soddies do sex trafficking and if you ask me what the un was
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:45.280]  i would say it's a human trafficking operation that's really all the all the everywhere they go
[2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:49.360]  that's all they do that's a great point let me ask you that then gavin and and turn it was as well
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:55.760]  when we're looking at this i mean i used to hear people like david horowitz read his book 16 years
[2:21:55.760 --> 2:22:00.240]  ago the left plans to merge with the muslims and take over and sharia law and i'm like this is
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:04.000]  the biggest load of crap i've ever heard i don't live under the muslim control some countries aren't
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:10.320]  that radical some are but i'm like this is crazy now the democrats putting hajibs on marches i'm at
[2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:15.120]  thousands of women putting hajibs on muslim women running and the guys in literal muslim i was going
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:21.280]  ha country malia and and and all this craziness and then they're running over people every week
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:25.760]  with cars and stock home and london everywhere and the media won't say it's muslims and then like
[2:22:25.760 --> 2:22:29.920]  we wildly criticize some muslim and they have a law firm threatening to sewish and and it just
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:35.760]  seems like and then all this why is the left literally in bed with the most monotheistic
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:40.960]  cult like anti-woman anti-liberal thing on earth i mean i know we talk about this all the time but
[2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:50.000]  they the left is so bad they're so anti-freedom anti-west anti-western chivalrous male that they
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:55.440]  will roll into the most nasty crap in the world like a huge banquet of food and the highest quality
[2:22:55.440 --> 2:23:00.880]  cultures ready for them and they just throw it in the gutter and then climb into a cesspit into a
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:06.640]  into a sewage pond and are like rubbing crap all over themselves gannon well i think it's because
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:11.200]  they hate the family and why do they hate the family i don't know they have daddy issues maybe
[2:23:11.200 --> 2:23:16.080]  they're weak and they can't bear the idea of having kids and having to propose and women
[2:23:16.080 --> 2:23:20.400]  can't handle that they they can create and shape lives they're they're overwhelmed by their own
[2:23:20.400 --> 2:23:25.440]  magic their own their sentient beings as and colter calls them and men just don't have the balls to
[2:23:25.440 --> 2:23:30.080]  stop playing video games and actually put a ring on it and so they've created this world
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:34.800]  where everything about them is anti-family more trans more gay weddings we have to
[2:23:35.520 --> 2:23:39.920]  because they don't have it they're against it vote because they don't have it they're against it right
[2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:46.000]  gavin right and they they go they see these muslims and they go well they are racist homophobic
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:51.840]  prejudice extremists who want to obliterate the west but in that obliteration the family will get
[2:23:51.840 --> 2:23:56.800]  destroyed so i'm going to have linda sars to a run the woman's march and i'll put a he job on my head
[2:23:56.800 --> 2:24:01.600]  well also and i don't i don't want to get too sort of um you know family friendly but a lot of
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:06.560]  feminists do have very dark desires fifty shades of gray sold a lot of copies and you know so there
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:11.360]  might be a little bit they maybe they like that dominant component of islam and maybe feminism
[2:24:11.360 --> 2:24:17.360]  maybe they've suppressed it and we kiss their ass on respect is but the pure dirtiness of it they
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:21.920]  get off on like the slave brothel and the yeah because a lot of them that they want to have
[2:24:21.920 --> 2:24:26.720]  women in that position so they want to be managers in islam over the other slave women right exactly
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:30.880]  so there it's they're so repressed now that there's a counter reaction they would say well i would
[2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:35.760]  rather be dominated by these people rather than deal with these beta males and gavin that's a smart
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:39.760]  point you make that point similarly everybody really wants the strong alpha male figure the
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:43.520]  problem is not enough of them you just pointed that out it's a shortage it is our fault men are
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:47.680]  not being men we cause this so so that there's the paradigm then they see islam and think oh
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:53.680]  that's a daddy exactly well when they call us bitches and they say we're weak and they go white
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:58.800]  men need to die what they're really doing is taunting us and it's it's a met they're asking
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:04.080]  for a metaphorical now not little they're asking for a metaphorical slap where you go psh don't
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:09.840]  you dare talk to me like that and john connery sometimes a woman needs at the club yeah sometimes
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:14.240]  a good smack right because john connery that that clip he goes sometimes a woman needs a smack you
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:18.160]  know metaphorical but yeah we always got to be careful talking jitter i've never smacked a woman
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:22.640]  i haven't felt like god this is getting clipped right now this is getting i i already know right
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:27.200]  now this segment is gonna this is gonna be the segment i don't mean literally but say you put on
[2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:32.080]  gangster rap at the club white women just flood the dance floor and it'll they'll be saying things
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:36.720]  i can't say on this show about bitches and what i'm gonna do to them and the woman are just dancing
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:42.720]  their asses off they love testosterone and they're only pretending that they want these beta male
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:48.320]  allies they don't have sex with them well what about alex balvin drier than a feminist man out it
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:52.640]  wasn't an alex balvin who went on that ran against his daughter and was screaming at her and now he
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:57.280]  bashes trump and calls trump a massager he's like you're a worthless pig he sounds worse than
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.160]  then he sounds worse than mel Gibson yeah but the left gives him a pass that's the whole thing is
[2:26:02.160 --> 2:26:06.400]  they'll they'll take they'll take that clip that we just gave and they'll try to make a whole story
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:12.000]  out of it when alex balvin actually is a in my opinion domestic abuser the way he talked on the
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:17.360]  at least emotional abuse yes i wasn't defending son connery's things no i know but i just know
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:21.680]  how they're gonna smack i'm just saying they're wanting to be truly put slave brothels and smacked
[2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:26.080]  around and and put on slave blocks yeah yeah exactly i knew i was just i i know how they're
[2:26:26.080 --> 2:26:30.240]  gonna i know how the fake news works now and no i agree they're editing what they're gonna do so
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:34.560]  you know we just gotta make sure next turn of its called for enslaving women right because i can
[2:26:34.560 --> 2:26:40.400]  just i can just see that now but yeah alex balvin is a legitimate emotional abuser of women and yet
[2:26:40.400 --> 2:26:44.400]  he's on saturday night live big show there's no advertising boycott well no he reportedly smacks
[2:26:44.400 --> 2:26:49.360]  him around so i want to know why is alex balvin allowed on saturday night live to bash trump
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:53.360]  why we get taken out of context and lied about it's known trump has never touched a woman either
[2:26:53.360 --> 2:26:57.840]  about yeah exactly not physically in a mean way so so alex balvin that the way he talked on that
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:02.720]  answering machine was just horrific and yet nobody's trying to advertise him boycott his
[2:27:02.720 --> 2:27:07.840]  advertises the left gives him a pass gavin why do you think that is because it's sports to them
[2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:12.960]  you know they followed obama through everything they followed clinton through the cigar incident
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:17.520]  that's their team the dalas killboys but one thing i love about the right i mean it's frustrating
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.720]  that we're fractured but we're also rational and we're here for the truth so we drag your heels out
[2:27:22.720 --> 2:27:26.880]  when you lie to us or when you're a hypocrite or when you do something wrong they're not in it for
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:31.360]  truth that's why every time you ask them for a number like how many legals are there or how much
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:37.440]  do we spend per student uh per year they have no they don't have the remotest idea one woman told
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:43.520]  me there's 70 billion illegals in america that was the number she threw out and you realize oh this
[2:27:43.520 --> 2:27:49.360]  is all posturing to you that's right people posture intellectually because they have no data
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:53.360]  then they call people that are informed conspiracy theorists that's how they have their past to not
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:57.440]  be informed because there's 35 million illegal conservatively there's seven and a half billion
[2:27:57.440 --> 2:28:02.400]  people in the world there's 335 million the united states there's 1.5 billion in china there's a billion
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:06.880]  point uh point five in india they don't know any of this stuff they don't know the population
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:12.160]  latin america's 689 million they don't know the population of mexico's 126 million i mean
[2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:16.640]  but to them though that's oh that's conspiracy theory he's just showing off yeah they don't
[2:28:16.640 --> 2:28:21.520]  understand demographics and migrant flow they don't know and actually they they don't know that
[2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:25.680]  most of the so-called refugees going into europe are actually not refugees they went there for
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:30.560]  the best welfare this was a big story i broke which is 80 percent of the muslim men in europe
[2:28:30.560 --> 2:28:37.200]  are on welfare what the hell yeah and moreover when i went to investigate this refugee crisis bs i
[2:28:37.200 --> 2:28:42.560]  found pictures where they told people don't get fingerprinted in denmark because they'll make
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:47.440]  you stay in denmark you want to go to europe and you want to go to germany austria for the big box
[2:28:47.440 --> 2:28:51.440]  the welfare i kid you not they actually admitted yeah so they actually are saying don't go to
[2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:55.280]  denmark well wait a minute you're a refugee i've been to denmark i loved i could live in denmark
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:29:00.640]  but if you're a refugee from a war-torn country don't go to denmark because they might and let's not
[2:29:00.640 --> 2:29:06.640]  be mean it's admitted they have like hundreds of times increased birth defects because they come

[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:19.440]  and happy and not even hyping up showdown in north korea it's already 1 30 a.m their time
[2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:22.880]  right now in north korea they're preparing to test the nuclear weapon and launch missiles

[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:56.720]  they banned us off ad roll they google's started to restrict us the democrats were openly calling
[2:34:56.720 --> 2:35:02.320]  for us to be banned we had like 3.3 million dollars last year on ad rolls money we made to fund the
[2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:06.720]  operation wasn't profit was money we made to then fund this operation i go out and advertise outside
[2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:10.960]  the show to be able to pay for it uh and because i've learned they go out for sponsors sponsors
[2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:15.520]  are fickle you know whatever we have some great sponsors that's mainly the network i have my
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:20.240]  sponsors and that's you the american people and so we're having a christian even if you're not
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:26.560]  christian it's politically incorrect to say it um holiday special for easter of 30 to 40 off

[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:29.600]  of course adults watch you too but it's so exciting that that they call me the meme machine
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:34.800]  you know one of the top memes out there i love being made fun of you're super popular that's
[2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:39.040]  got to worry the elite but how does compound media how do you guys fund yourselves because
[2:37:39.040 --> 2:37:43.360]  you never come on the air and plug anything i want to gabin mcginnis book i want to gabin mcginnis i
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:47.920]  want to sell your books i want to get vol bacon movies with you i mean we need to fund ourselves we
[2:37:47.920 --> 2:37:53.200]  need to be the culture hollywood and msn max like we're bad if we sell a book or sell a product well
[2:37:53.200 --> 2:37:58.800]  what the hell do they do they got prozac ads and you know irritable leg syndrome crap that you know
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:04.000]  whatever so so how are you guys funding yourselves well we're subscription based here at compound
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:11.120]  media uh i also work at the rebel up in canada and that's ads on youtube and uh that there's a real
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:16.960]  crackdown as you as you know on youtubers and demonetizing them and it is incredibly frustrating
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:22.480]  seeing this fake news lies about how coca-cola ads are getting stuck on racist videos with the n word
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:26.320]  on them uh they shouldn't have to do that and you go well that's a myth you're using a justify
[2:38:26.320 --> 2:38:32.080]  censorship but the good news is that they can't keep us down anymore the infrastructure has shattered
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:37.360]  and now anyone everyone has a voice anyone can make a show make a video they can shut down youtube
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:42.400]  will always have these subscription services and it must be incredibly frustrating for them to not
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:46.480]  be able to control the narrative i mean we saw that with the white house press corps when trump
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:50.880]  said he's going to move it to a bigger room and bring in guys like lucian wintrich he was
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:56.480]  what 25 years old this kid who works at gateway pundit and all of a sudden jake tapper and chuck
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:02.000]  todd don't have the front row seats anymore and i think that's a metaphor for information in america
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:06.240]  all of a sudden it's available to everyone and guess what that's why these millennials are the
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:12.800]  most red-pilled millennials in three generations they're 15 percent uh saying they're conservative
[2:39:12.800 --> 2:39:17.760]  whereas before my generation and baby boomers it was like two or three percent well so about
[2:39:17.760 --> 2:39:24.800]  generation z generation z millennials are either total cult members or awake generation z though
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:28.640]  i'm talking like eight-year-old kids ever run up to me i don't know what is going on what's
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:34.240]  happening with generation z you know uh eight years old to say 15 years old right now yeah well
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:38.240]  you know there's i talked to a kid the other day i had him on my show he's 15 and he works near the
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:43.760]  coca-cola factory i think that's in Idaho i can't remember but he said the students are about half
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:50.640]  conservative uh the parents are like 80 percent conservative 100 of the teachers are hyper hyper
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.920]  left wing and tell us that we can't argue certain comments i said well will you get an f if you
[2:39:55.920 --> 2:40:00.400]  write an article on how uh nancy on how greg trump is he goes no no i wouldn't be allowed to write it
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:05.440]  like you have to say what the assignment is you'd never be able to write that so i just keep saying
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:11.360]  these kids get an f write the assignment that you want do it well and get an f these kids we
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:16.800]  have to show education that the free market of ideas is more dominant than your hysterical marxist
[2:40:16.800 --> 2:40:21.200]  dogma and then call the newspaper when they don't let you publish it call call newspaper when they
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:26.800]  block you make an issue out of it i email me with the word education in the subject i am
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:32.720]  compiling a massive database of all these power points that go on in class all the posters in
[2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:38.800]  the hallway it is way more extreme even than than liberal colleges i mean high schools have
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:47.040]  giant banners that say we need more queer families why these kids are 14 imagine if a heterosexual
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:51.760]  walked into a group of fifth graders and said i'm going to teach you how to have sex that'd be called
[2:40:51.760 --> 2:40:59.440]  a pedophile yeah as long as it's liberal that we need more white families i mean there'd be hysterics
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:05.120]  there'd be riots in the streets they have gone so far left that they've fallen off the deep end
[2:41:05.120 --> 2:41:10.720]  and i think it makes it easy to tell kids look look it up we we're not evil and it's funny when
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:15.120]  you talk to these guys about how evil we are we're not using we want to kill everyone and you listen
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:20.240]  to them when you go that sounds scary these these people they talk about a trumps america where the
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:26.080]  disabled are are at risk and gays are hiding in their homes scared of being killed and you go
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:31.280]  jesus that sounds horrible i want to i want to help you fight these people and then you go what are
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:36.560]  we even doing in a country that's worse than venezuela and cuba and china i want to i want to
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:42.800]  go escape i want to go to to uh i want to go to venezuela where i'll be safe because of the america
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:48.000]  you're describing sounds like babelon it sounds like sodom and gemora i was about to say i was on
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:52.640]  cnn this weekend quite a bit just looking at it they had an article about how venezuela wasn't that
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:57.440]  bad that was america's fault and then another article about our we were bad to north korea
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:03.600]  that's why they hate us and i'm reading it it's so and then mit came out with a children's book
[2:42:03.600 --> 2:42:07.440]  and a textbook on how to teach kids to be communist so instead of the people that admitted the
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:11.920]  internet now are teaching us how to be communists you know you look up the most dangerous place on
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:16.480]  earth and caracas jumps up i mean i don't even think they have plumbing they just have sewage
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:22.800]  dripping down the streets uh same with port-a-prince and in Haiti uh and you go how blind do you have
[2:42:22.800 --> 2:42:26.960]  to be to not know that the west is the best i remember bernie sanders this is an old clip
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:32.560]  you can find but he goes you know people always use the waiting in line uh as a reason that communism
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:37.440]  doesn't work but at least they're waiting in line to get food you know these other countries no one
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:42.320]  even there's no line-ups to go because there's no food you go what you mean like america where
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:47.120]  i have to decide between 300 different types of coffee every time i go to the grocery store
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:54.080]  and a hundred different iphone cases there's too much freedom in america shopping's too hard
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:42:59.440]  it is crazy when every communist system fails and it's still being propped up
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:02.640]  so let me ask you this before you take some calls from craig in just a moment
[2:43:02.640 --> 2:43:07.360]  where do you and your crystal ball see this fight going because they think they're tripling down
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:11.040]  with more brainwashing that somehow that'll fix their system i think it's accelerating
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:16.240]  their collapse yeah they've painted themselves into a corner they keep choosing stupider and
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:22.240]  stupider pawns in their chess game first they chose trans and they said these are our new
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:26.320]  oppressed and we're going to use trans they tried blacks but blacks didn't get with their
[2:43:26.320 --> 2:43:30.720]  pro gay stuff so they said all right you're out we're going to go with trans and you go uh a lot
[2:43:30.720 --> 2:43:34.640]  of those guys are just mentally ill gays i'm not sure you want that on your front lines and then
[2:43:34.640 --> 2:43:39.520]  the trans start winning all these women's sports and they go oh that's not working out we have a
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:44.960]  female mma fighter who who was a man just pounding the crap out of a woman and you go oh
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:49.840]  we're getting a little more advanced yeah what is that we're suddenly all over they are accepting
[2:43:49.840 --> 2:43:55.040]  men and female sports when they're men and they're obviously cheating it's it's so crass want to
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:58.320]  make the joke about the gay stuff at the very beginning i'm not against anybody but then they
[2:43:58.320 --> 2:44:02.640]  say all the news i'm this homophobe and make up all this weird crap because i point out that
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:08.160]  chemicals in the water are making the amphibians you know gay or whatever then they turn into i'm
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:13.920]  anti-gay or i you know i call the congressman you know say your second globalist ding dong or
[2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:17.360]  whatever and and i'm sorry it's a family show that's what i said the late night show and they
[2:44:17.360 --> 2:44:22.000]  say i'm anti-gay i'm not anti-gay i meant he's subserving to the new world order he's selling
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:28.560]  us out it's like this or or or you criticize anything the democrats are doing you're not anti-semitic
[2:44:28.560 --> 2:44:34.000]  they don't even say where you're anti-semitic well they they keep screaming at me you need to love me
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:39.360]  more you need to accept me you need to bake me a cake for my wedding and i go we're not homophobic
[2:44:39.360 --> 2:44:44.800]  we don't care when i grew up there was liberachi dancing around with his rings and we had paul
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:51.440]  lin going i just chose me at the ymca going i love to go to the ymca and meet boys and make out with
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:57.760]  men and we all went that's a catchy tune go ahead but then they start saying no love me and we go
[2:44:57.760 --> 2:45:02.240]  whoa whoa you need to calm down i don't care what you do so it's an act of bullying so so what
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:06.640]  happens to them is they've made this giant generation of just jellyfish that are all
[2:45:06.640 --> 2:45:11.520]  into their pity parties and their grandstanding what happens to them as the whole reality turns
[2:45:11.520 --> 2:45:16.720]  against them well here's the thing so they went black no didn't work trans no didn't work now
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:22.720]  they're got they've gone full muslim now that he job is a symbol of freedom next i guess a burqa is
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:27.280]  going to become a feminist icon no actually that's all i'm seeing in as the new feminist icon so i get
[2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:33.280]  it they're a billion 500 million muslims probably estimated maybe lower 1.4 billion so i guess that's
[2:45:33.280 --> 2:45:39.680]  their new demographic that's their new group yeah look to thwart daddy to make us mad to to to make
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:46.640]  us cringe they crawled into bed with people who hate them and they've also been building a bubble
[2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:52.000]  around themselves where they need safe spaces and you go well you're a human recipe for disaster
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:56.160]  you've said i want to be weaker and weaker and weaker and make myself more vulnerable and then
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:01.040]  i want to get into bed with people who hate everything i stand for and want me to die good
[2:46:01.040 --> 2:46:09.760]  luck with that bye so how does it shake out that's what i'm saying how does it end uh they lose
[2:46:09.760 --> 2:46:14.400]  they come crawling back on their knees to trump and they learn to shut up because they don't
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:19.360]  know what they're talking about this is like the record industry in the nineties i mean the entire
[2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:25.920]  liberal hysterical ethos has now spiraled into this crazy antifa reactionary thing where they
[2:46:25.920 --> 2:46:30.240]  attack old ladies with pepper spray for having an american flag no one takes them seriously anymore
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:35.840]  we don't have title nine crap or any this legislation that supports their mythical view of america
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:40.080]  and they just sort of peter out they just learn to shut their mouths and they get back into
[2:46:40.080 --> 2:46:44.880]  art and music and fashion and the other things they're good at or they claim they're good at so
[2:46:44.880 --> 2:46:49.440]  that's what it is it's a bunch of beta losers trying to be dominant because dominance were
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:54.480]  taught it wasn't going to be dominant so we stood down and then all the betas come in yeah imagine
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:46:59.520]  a bunch of ten-year-old girls got into british soccer into football and they went down for a
[2:46:59.520 --> 2:47:05.680]  row with man you know it and went oh you got a problem oh bloody ight man you and they started
[2:47:05.680 --> 2:47:11.120]  headbutting soccer hooligans that wouldn't last for very long and those little girls would go back
[2:47:11.120 --> 2:47:14.880]  home and that's what we're going to see within the next few years i mean these are all just the
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:22.000]  stages of grief that we're seeing here uh depression anxiety uh reluctance to admit what's happened
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:26.800]  denial uh they're just going to acquiesce and slowly realize that the patriarchy is back
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:32.160]  and the big boys know what they're doing sit down well i hope the big boys know what they're doing
[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:35.840]  i just hope the public gets involved and engaged for prosperity got me again this is our guest

[2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:55.200]  on trump what's your view on what's happening geopolitical are you worried about north career
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:47:58.800]  he's got it i mean uh
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:09.200]  what she said about three dimensional chess he's playing that and then some and i'm sure all these
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:14.160]  leaders that he are he's messing with over here to create all that know exactly where he stands
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:19.200]  he said he would use courier service instead of making a phone call so everybody can listen in
[2:48:19.200 --> 2:48:23.760]  and he's a courier so they know where he's at and he knows they know where he's coming from
[2:48:23.760 --> 2:48:30.320]  they know what he's about to do yeah i mean i wouldn't be surprised if he called us on and said
[2:48:30.320 --> 2:48:36.720]  get all your guys out there i'm about to blow it up every every time i get to feel all trumps
[2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:43.280]  gone globalist i stopped i said no that's more than three dimensional chess he's got this he plays
[2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:49.120]  big he don't play small he plays on a big scale well if he was globalist they wouldn't be attacking
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:54.640]  him they are attacking him like he is high noon to vampires gavin i'm scared of jared kushner
[2:48:54.640 --> 2:49:00.640]  he's the only flying the ointment and when i found out that george soros gave him 250 million dollars
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:06.720]  for a real estate deal that's the same as saying jared he's funded by george soros
[2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:11.840]  and i thought trump liked success i mean kushner's a failure
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:17.360]  yeah he's just a little rich kid that that bought that plays with daddy's money and
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:21.840]  yes if someone gives you a hundred million dollar building in new york city you're going to sell it
[2:49:21.840 --> 2:49:27.120]  for a profit trust me it's total it is i won't talk about how much money we've brought in to
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:31.120]  find this operation but we did this with our listeners by ourselves kushner has done nothing
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:35.840]  but ruin everything he's touched i'm not against kushner i just don't get why i guess he's married
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:39.360]  to daddy's favorite daughter i mean that's what it is so there's there's the chick in the armor
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:43.920]  is that trump's a softie for his family yeah well quilter said that too she said
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:47.440]  well after the day after he's elected she said the only thing that could go wrong now
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:53.680]  is if he hires his sons because america's not a monarchy that was britain we kicked them out
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:50:00.400]  so we didn't vote or north korea for you north korea's hereditary dictatorship yeah well we'll

[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:49.920]  about 45 million that's conservative it will exaggerate their numbers 45 million a week listen
[2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:55.440]  watch just what we put out not to mention the websites i don't say that to brag it's so
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:54:59.760]  you have confidence this ideology of freedom is the latest thing
[2:55:01.200 --> 2:55:05.760]  like they have america is the old idea and point out our problems it was never truly realized
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:11.920]  but to produce more patents more inventions more technology look at how we're dominant
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:16.240]  we're 307 million people we're still the greatest force on earth why a little bit of freedom

[2:55:21.680 --> 2:55:25.040]  mcginnis but yeah but i've been asking a lot of the other questions i want to take a few calls here
[2:55:25.040 --> 2:55:29.280]  but uh and i routinely a couple days a week at least go and watch your show or parts of it when
[2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:33.200]  i'm on the elliptical or i'm in the car of my son he watches it and listens to a
[2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:39.520]  muller daughter what oh you like to show so i almost hate asking the questions to myself as
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:44.160]  that tends to direct you and in other ways but when you wake up at three o'clock in the morning
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:49.040]  is it positive is it negative i mean what's your gut tell you when i wake up at three in the morning
[2:55:49.040 --> 2:55:53.600]  i usually have this thing the irish called the horrors and i think it's when your liver
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:57.840]  runs out of water and it's it's trying to clean your blood it's burning and you want a bunch of
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:01.680]  water so it wakes you up and he goes dude i'm either gonna have to take water from your brain
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:06.080]  and that's a hangover or you got to get up and get some water so i get some water and then the
[2:56:06.080 --> 2:56:10.880]  don't just keep a big jug of water by the bed just like dump it down well i'm scared of the
[2:56:10.880 --> 2:56:15.520]  kids knocking that over so i have to walk all the way to the bathroom and uh grab whatever cup is
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:20.800]  there but uh no i feel really optimistic really exciting we've never been really excited we've
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:25.280]  never been this empowered before all the dinosaurs controlled the news and you watch
[2:56:25.280 --> 2:56:31.760]  cernovich on 60 minutes and that's such a perfect example of where we've arrived they sit there and
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:36.800]  they go fake news you are your fake news and he goes what why because i said hillary stick yeah
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.800]  and he goes how do you know she's not sick scott belly and he goes the campaign told us
[2:56:41.840 --> 2:56:46.080]  because they don't get how dumb they look and they put that out why would you listen to the
[2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:51.280]  campaign and then the show goes on to describe horrible fake news sites that we all read like
[2:56:51.280 --> 2:56:58.640]  denver guardian and some other one i hadn't heard of like the national post uh observational something
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:04.160]  and you know who put it it's worse 20 isn't refox but over a hundred fake sites to attack
[2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:08.640]  prompt you meet you know you were in those they attacked us all with hundreds of fake websites
[2:57:09.840 --> 2:57:15.440]  huffington post in new zealand just put an article saying we need to deny white man the right to vote
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.360]  and you can tell when you look at the author and you read it that it's totally fabricated
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:24.400]  and this is just a clickbait thought catalog i agree but did you know gabin that they put out
[2:57:24.400 --> 2:57:28.720]  over a hundred websites that were fake attacking everybody i did not know that no i didn't even
[2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:33.920]  know this look 20s history fox gave real apology for fake news campaign they claimed it was a film
[2:57:33.920 --> 2:57:38.880]  promotion that went on for a year in the election but it attacked you me trump it was mainly trump
[2:57:38.880 --> 2:57:43.280]  we were all in there you didn't see we're so busy we don't even know they're the ones doing it
[2:57:43.280 --> 2:57:47.520]  that's the new york times by the way admitting that well that's scary because it shows that
[2:57:47.520 --> 2:57:52.960]  rupert murdoch is a globalist and he wants open borders and i think we had roger ailes at fox news
[2:57:52.960 --> 2:57:57.680]  sort of holding him back and saying i'm gonna keep this try to keep this at least a little bit
[2:57:57.680 --> 2:58:02.400]  right wing there's no you're right but now that he's gone i think fox is gonna go full
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:08.960]  wall street journal and just say open up the borders people we need more others very astute
[2:58:08.960 --> 2:58:14.160]  in fact i met with some of the executives at that so-called ritz carlton in clave one it was not
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:19.840]  like a holiday express but for ritz carlton i'm bashing it's just like a crap hole and and and i
[2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:23.120]  met this ritz carlton and i would meet all these fox people they're like oh yeah there's been a
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:28.160]  coup you're right blah blah we're gonna come back and go to uh shadow wars but holding like a patriot
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:31.680]  everybody holding for an hour it's $30 free thing whatever so it doesn't matter i feel bad now

[3:02:13.680 --> 3:02:22.000]  government uh trump don't discord trump the way uh they used to do it the old saying goes how do you
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:31.680]  catch a fox you you bait him with another fox so what he does in his administration is putting in
[3:02:31.680 --> 3:02:37.040]  people that you a lot of people don't appreciate but he's weeding out he's saying who's coming to the
[3:02:37.040 --> 3:02:44.720]  surface and jerry kushner he's gonna out his own self john mccain's gonna be ousted he's gonna uh
[3:02:44.720 --> 3:02:49.120]  there's no i get it he's bringing the enemies in to see who thinks they're and trump's smart
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:53.520]  no i mean look he's delivering he's when everything global is tate my gut tells me he's good and and
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:57.920]  we're seeing amazing amazing things happen and you know we think tomorrow it's gonna happen
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:03.040]  we're already what three hours in to north korea's 15th when they're supposed to gonna test all these
[3:03:03.040 --> 3:03:08.320]  weapons so god bless you shadow warrior please call back in again great point uh in in closing
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:12.720]  gabin i mean i hope nothing happens tomorrow but kim jong-un was keep shooting missiles at japan
[3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:17.120]  threatening everybody china says they may go in and nuke them first i think that's the deal
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:20.640]  now trump said for weeks china does something or we do it well i think china said okay we'll do it
[3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:27.440]  yeah you know north koreans are great people and they're very tenacious industrious people you have
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:32.080]  to understand the modern generation they saw their dad go i love kim jong-un and then they
[3:03:32.080 --> 3:03:37.760]  watched their dad starve to death so the ones that are alive right now have seen what kind of loyalty
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:42.880]  what loyalty gets you in that country and they're also industrious enough to get food and live i mean
[3:03:42.880 --> 3:03:47.520]  being alive in north korea right now means you're smart and you know what you're doing and you're
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:53.200]  tough so i think i agree i've seen a lot of photos in there they're good-looking people once they chop
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:03:58.640]  the head off this monster i feel confident that the body can live and thrive we just need to
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:04.640]  to let north korea be it's uh i i don't i don't think it's beyond saving now but the scary thing
[3:04:04.640 --> 3:04:08.880]  is with these re-education camps the second the first bomb goes off these people have been told
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:12.640]  they're gonna they're gonna be killed so even if there's not a nuclear option even if trump
[3:04:12.640 --> 3:04:17.520]  sends in just a few tomahawks that's gonna be a genocide because they're going to kill everyone
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:22.800]  in those re-education camps and there's nothing we can do about it we can't not retaliate so we're
[3:04:22.800 --> 3:04:28.880]  gonna see a lot of deaths tomorrow a poor north korea they're like the iranians they've done polls
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:34.640]  like 80% of iranians went out of what they're in you know everyone outside of the west is dying
[3:04:34.640 --> 3:04:38.640]  to come to the west which is why we have an immigration problem because we're the best

[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:04.400]  as well you've heard of vigilante justice right well now we have islamic sharia vigilantes from
[3:05:04.400 --> 3:05:09.920]  the star tribune minneapolis muslims protest sharia vigilante in cedar riverside area that's
[3:05:09.920 --> 3:05:15.680]  right 22 year old abdulla rashid is trying to enforce what he calls the civil part of sharia
[3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:20.640]  law in his area he's been telling people in the cedar riverside some molly dominated neighborhood
[3:05:20.640 --> 3:05:25.680]  not to drink use drugs or interact with the opposite sex if he sees muslim women that he believes
[3:05:25.680 --> 3:05:30.640]  are dressed inappropriately he approaches them and suggests they don a hijab back in february
[3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:35.280]  minneapolis police received reports from concerned citizens who saw rashid in a dark green uniform
[3:05:35.280 --> 3:05:40.000]  donned with patches that said muslim defense force and religious police also on the patches
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:44.800]  were two flags associated with isis and other terrorist groups but his muslim brethren do
[3:05:44.800 --> 3:05:49.200]  not share his same views in fact the islamic institute for minnesota issued a statement
[3:05:49.200 --> 3:05:53.520]  saying rashid does not speak any way for the islamic institute of minnesota or muslims in

[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:17.840]  to the alex jones show and now your host david night
[3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:26.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and y'all hear that mission impossible
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:30.240]  music i was going to start with some stories about facebook and what's happening there because
[3:08:30.240 --> 3:08:38.880]  that only are they uh and big hot water in the uk because of uh child uh pornography child rape
[3:08:38.880 --> 3:08:45.920]  videos that they refuse to take down uh but of course we've also got the calls from the former
[3:08:45.920 --> 3:08:51.600]  fec uh member saying that we need to censor political speech we need to be very careful
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:56.320]  about who is on facebook so they're censoring political speech but they're not taking down
[3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:01.040]  very disturbing images i was going to start with that but let's start since we heard that mission
[3:09:01.040 --> 3:09:07.440]  impossible uh theme song there you know there was a a story that came out of foreign policy
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:15.600]  a very establishment status globalist cfr type of outlook that they have with the world and they're
[3:09:15.600 --> 3:09:22.080]  talking about the cia and they say mission unstoppable why the cia is running america's
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:26.720]  foreign policy and they said this is they've been running american foreign policy and of course
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:31.200]  we all happen to notice actually especially those of us here at info wars have been talking
[3:09:31.200 --> 3:09:35.360]  about this for a long time they've been running foreign policy since 9 11 you know we had the
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:41.520]  coalition of the willing or as i like to call it the coalition of the drilling uh people uh just
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:46.080]  hitting the mantra saying hey let's forget this you know this war is really about the free flow
[3:09:46.080 --> 3:09:50.480]  of oil at market prices it's like yeah okay let's just call it the coalition of the drilling uh
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:54.880]  we've been fed this kind of stuff before and it's the cia that is putting this policy through
[3:09:54.880 --> 3:10:00.240]  it's a perfect perfect headline why the cia is running america's foreign policy one of the things
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:05.440]  i think is interesting and something of course as we talk about the influence of social media on
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:13.040]  this last election a big part of what happened was wiki leaks wasn't it and now we're seeing a big
[3:10:13.040 --> 3:10:18.400]  pushback against wiki leaks now donald trump liked what was being put out and he should have
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:23.280]  liked what was being put out there wasn't anything wrong with telling the truth about hillary's
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:29.840]  wars what she knew why we were going to war in libya we saw the emails where they're strategizing
[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:35.440]  inside the state department saying you know we can't put up with qaddafi having a metal back
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:39.920]  currency he's got enough money and uh he's got enough gold and silver that he's putting together
[3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:44.000]  a currency that'll be a regional currency they'll be backed by gold and silver we can't have that
[3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:49.840]  can't have him going in competition with the fiat currency central banks of the west
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:55.760]  so that's really the types of things that are going on in the backroom negotiations you need to
[3:10:55.760 --> 3:11:01.680]  know that we tell you that and you can kind of intuit that but you need to see the document so
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:06.080]  it's very important that wiki leaks put that stuff out it's very important that we learned
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:10.320]  that the people who are hacking the election who are hacking the democrat primary were
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:16.000]  the dnc officials and people like the mainstream media who are feeding hillary clinton questions
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:20.400]  in advance it was very important for us to know that very important for us to know how they were
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:26.240]  rigging the election against bernie sanders and so it was very important for us to see what wiki
[3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:29.920]  leaks was putting out there nobody has said that wiki leaks has put out anything false because they
[3:11:29.920 --> 3:11:36.720]  haven't what they put out was bona fide information and to say that it was hacked is not even true
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:41.040]  we've had a former british ambassador say i came to the united states i was handed this information
[3:11:41.040 --> 3:11:47.760]  by disgruntled people within the dnc i tried to say some of that to the people that i would interview
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:54.960]  at the at the dnc uh in philadelphia they would have none of it they would just look at me and
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:12:00.000]  almost put their hands over their ears but they would yell back at me no no it's the russians it's
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:05.440]  the russians it's the russians doing it and so they're implying that uh these emails were hacked
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:08.800]  they're implying that the elections were somehow hacked they weren't what they're saying is we
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:14.560]  didn't like the fact that you got this information that you got the truth about hillary clinton
[3:12:14.560 --> 3:12:21.760]  they didn't like that so it's very disappointing to see director mont mike pompio who they just
[3:12:21.760 --> 3:12:27.360]  had a replacement election for him uh in kansas on tuesday on thursday he now hammered wiki leaks
[3:12:27.360 --> 3:12:34.800]  calling the organization a non-state hostile intelligence service and i want to remind you
[3:12:34.800 --> 3:12:39.280]  because i retweeted this on my account i retweeted what wiki leaks put out they said this is a tweet
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:46.080]  that was sent by cia director now cia director mont mike pompio on the 24th of july 2016
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:51.680]  and he as a congressional representative said need further proof that the fix was in from
[3:12:51.680 --> 3:13:00.160]  president obama on down busted 19 252 emails from dnc leaked by wiki leaks so he liked it he liked
[3:13:00.160 --> 3:13:06.800]  it when it worked for him but now he says wiki leaks is a non-state hostile intelligence service
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:15.440]  maybe it's the state that is hostile to intelligence to the truth uh that's the really sad thing about
[3:13:15.440 --> 3:13:22.720]  this there was another uh release today from wiki leaks of the vault seven series first they came
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:26.400]  out with vault seven i don't know if that had i don't remember that had a keyword or not the second
[3:13:26.400 --> 3:13:33.200]  one was marvel not marvel lies in the comic books but marvel like you uh you know the the
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:39.120]  the round stones that you play games with that second release showed that or the first one
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:44.640]  showed that they were curating techniques to where they could do imposters they could look
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:51.200]  like another agency but they detail that in great deal in the marvel release and they showed how the
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:57.840]  cia had the tools we've heard and of course we heard this from we have heard this the source
[3:13:57.840 --> 3:14:01.760]  for all this information that the fbi is putting out and and least ran ahead and tried to ask this
[3:14:01.760 --> 3:14:06.560]  question at breitbart and they wouldn't let him ask the question of uh comey you want to say have
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:13.360]  you actually seen this stuff have you actually done the research or are you just taking the word
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:18.080]  of the people who worked for hillary clinton and the dnc on this and of course that was the answer
[3:14:18.720 --> 3:14:22.880]  so you ask these rhetorical questions when you're doing these interviews is like you're doing
[3:14:22.880 --> 3:14:28.480]  and a cross examination as an attorney you don't ask questions you don't already know the answers
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:34.400]  to and they knew that the democrats are pushing this information out there and comey is pushing
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:38.880]  this out there and he hasn't looked at this information but what are they telling us are
[3:14:38.880 --> 3:14:43.040]  the fingerprints that tell us that this was being done by the russians they said well
[3:14:43.040 --> 3:14:46.960]  obviously this is done on a sterile keyboard and it came from this area well we all know
[3:14:46.960 --> 3:14:51.600]  this is pretty simple stuff that you can route things around to make it look like it came from
[3:14:51.600 --> 3:14:57.760]  anywhere you want it to make look like it came from and even before this evidence came out from
[3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:03.280]  wiki leaks showing precisely how they make it look like it's done by on a foreign keyboard
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:09.760]  done by foreign language speakers uh we were talking to john mackafee who said nobody in their
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:15.280]  right mind would leave their own fingerprints i mean if you're a russian and you're hacking somewhere
[3:15:15.280 --> 3:15:19.600]  else you're not gonna you're gonna put stuff in there to make it look like you're somebody else
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:23.840]  like you're the chinese or you're the americans and vice versa the americans have the tools to make
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:29.840]  it look like all the stuff is coming from china or from russia or from north korea or from syria
[3:15:29.840 --> 3:15:34.400]  or whatever they've been a long list of different states that they use as the usual suspects to
[3:15:34.400 --> 3:15:37.840]  make it look like it's coming from them and so we saw that in the second release now what we've
[3:15:37.840 --> 3:15:43.120]  seen in the third release that came out today this one is uh they're calling it hive this latest
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:49.120]  batch of wiki leaks documents exposes alleged cia hacking techniques from vault seven the details
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:55.360]  how the agency can monitor its targets through the use of malware how they can carry out specific
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:16:02.960]  tasks on targeted machines this is a multi-platform malware suite that has customizable implants for
[3:16:02.960 --> 3:16:08.240]  a lot of different operating systems here are some of them windows of course solaris micro tick
[3:16:08.240 --> 3:16:14.320]  which is used in internet routers linux platforms a network video recorder operating system called
[3:16:14.320 --> 3:16:19.600]  avtech and they use that for closed circuit television recordings they're even able to hide
[3:16:19.600 --> 3:16:24.240]  the presence of the malware and have it self-destruct of course you know mission impossible right
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:30.480]  this this virus will self-destruct in just a little while and that's what they do that's
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:34.880]  one of the reasons folks when we look at this the first takeaway we should take from this
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:40.000]  and we're talking about hacking elections the first thing we need to make sure we do is keep the
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:46.080]  computers as far away from the election process and the vote taking and the vote counting as possible
[3:16:47.440 --> 3:16:53.440]  yeah we can report this on the internet but the election machines should not be electronic in any
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:58.560]  way shape or form and it's not enough to simply say that they're not connected to the internet
[3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:04.560]  and in some places they're trying to let people do internet voting we never can let that happen
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:10.560]  never let that happen it will be the absolute end of anything that even resembles an election and
[3:17:10.560 --> 3:17:16.720]  it's getting to the point now where they can they've been able to manipulate elections for a long
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:21.120]  time obviously there is some chance at local elections where they're not interested in it
[3:17:21.120 --> 3:17:28.880]  but if you put it electronically and you have electronic voting machines they will turn the
[3:17:28.880 --> 3:17:35.360]  hacking of our elections by our own government into an enterprise solution they will extend it down to
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:40.640]  dog catcher elections that's where they will go with his stuff if you let them do this so you
[3:17:40.640 --> 3:17:46.400]  have to keep this away we have to go back to ballots that are paper ballots where we have humans
[3:17:46.400 --> 3:17:51.280]  of both parties sitting there watching and monitoring the account and the counting and the
[3:17:51.840 --> 3:17:57.600]  custody of this and the transmission of these votes we absolutely must do this this explains
[3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:03.120]  this very well they can hide malware they put it on the HTTPS interface and of course that's what you
[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:09.760]  have as kind of the backbone of the internet they say utilizes unsuspicious looking cover domains
[3:18:09.760 --> 3:18:14.160]  so that you're not going to be aware that they're there and the course it has the self-delete function
[3:18:15.040 --> 3:18:19.680]  and that self-delete function we have seen over and over again used on voting machine hacks where
[3:18:19.680 --> 3:18:25.840]  they put something on a little thumb drive stick the thumb drive in the machine pull it out the
[3:18:25.840 --> 3:18:30.160]  thing messes around with the vote totals for the day and then at the end of the day it deletes
[3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:34.880]  itself so you can't find anything there we need to wake up to what's going on and folks if you
[3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:40.720]  think that this is making us safer you're simply not paying attention because one of the key things
[3:18:40.720 --> 3:18:46.320]  that WikiLeaks has pointed out is that as they have exposed these different tactics these viruses
[3:18:46.320 --> 3:18:52.000]  these hacks techniques that the CIA has done the exploits the holes and the security system that
[3:18:52.000 --> 3:18:57.120]  they're able to get through we have the people who have defense contracts who are not the least
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:02.960]  bit interested in fixing it like google google is not interested others are others have corresponded
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:07.200]  with them and they said we're going to release a cross tabulation and show you the people who
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:11.440]  are interested in fixing this and the people who absolutely do not want to fix it because the CIA
[3:19:11.440 --> 3:19:17.440]  does not want to fix the CIA knew that they had lost their hacking toolkit and they didn't tell
[3:19:17.440 --> 3:19:22.480]  anybody about it so now you've got all these criminals throughout the world who have access to
[3:19:22.480 --> 3:19:28.000]  your banking account if you do it online they have access to identity theft of yours they can
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:33.920]  steal your identity they can steal your banking accounts why because the CIA decided that they
[3:19:33.920 --> 3:19:38.080]  want to be able to break in and look at anything that you do and they could care less couldn't
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:43.280]  care less if you have a criminal who is doing the same thing so they're going to leave you vulnerable
[3:19:43.280 --> 3:19:48.480]  that's why this whole thing about thinking that you're going to trade your privacy you're going
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:54.320]  to trade your liberty for security and safety that is a fools bargain folks stay with us we're

[3:25:53.440 --> 3:26:00.400]  wanted to talk about was christian persecution in egypt and throughout the middle east that's one
[3:26:00.400 --> 3:26:05.920]  thing that really hasn't gotten much attention has it most of our focus has been on what's
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:11.120]  going on with syria what's been going on in north korea and a lot of people are very concerned about
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:18.160]  what may happen especially in egypt this Easter they've canceled a lot of services and basically
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:21.760]  going and hiding isn't that unfortunate that that's happening in the short amount of time that we
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:25.920]  got left in this short segment here i want to talk about what's going on with facebook
[3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:30.560]  as you know we've talked a great deal about the pedophile rings that are getting busted
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:36.800]  a lot of uh un involvement in these pedophile rings both in Haiti and in africa and other
[3:26:36.800 --> 3:26:40.640]  places those are big stories but let's take a look at what's going on with facebook for example
[3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:47.360]  in the uk they're in big trouble this is being reported by the times out of the uk they say
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:52.480]  facebook is at risk of a criminal prosecution in britain for refusing to remove potentially
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:26:59.520]  illegal terrorist and child pornography content despite being told it was on the site they failed
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:04.240]  to take it down basically the moderators said well this doesn't breach the site's community
[3:27:04.240 --> 3:27:09.840]  standards what was it that didn't breach the community standards okay they flagged these
[3:27:09.840 --> 3:27:13.840]  things to the moderators or moderators said no that doesn't violate our community standards well
[3:27:13.840 --> 3:27:20.320]  it was things like an isis beheading several violent pedophile cartoons a video of an apparent
[3:27:20.320 --> 3:27:25.440]  sexual assault on a child a propaganda poster that glorified recent terrorist attacks in
[3:27:25.440 --> 3:27:30.400]  london and egypt which we're going to be talking about on the next section so they didn't take
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:36.880]  that down they said that really doesn't violate our standards okay now the prosecutor in this uh
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:43.440]  the leading queens counsel's name is julian nulls he said and told uh the news that this appears
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:47.920]  this one of these videos i just mentioned appears to depict a sexual assault on a child
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:53.280]  and he said i would argue that the actions of the people employed by facebook to keep
[3:27:53.280 --> 3:27:58.720]  up on or to remove reported posts these are posts that were reported by the community
[3:27:58.720 --> 3:28:02.160]  and these are employees of facebook who are supposed to take this down he said that should
[3:28:02.160 --> 3:28:07.440]  be regarded as the actions of facebook as a corporate entity so in other words if you hire
[3:28:07.440 --> 3:28:13.920]  these people to moderate these sites when objectionable material is put up when pedophile
[3:28:13.920 --> 3:28:19.360]  material is put up when videos of sexual assaults on a child are put up and people tell you about
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:24.160]  it and you say that doesn't violate our standards he says i think that is something that is owned
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:29.280]  by the facebook corporation because they created these people to do that now while they won't take
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:35.200]  that kind of stuff down and they're getting in hot water in the uk for that we see that an revel
[3:28:36.320 --> 3:28:42.320]  who was a democrat and she was on the federal elections commission and remember she came out
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:47.680]  she wanted to target news sites she wanted to target drudge and say you're posting all of this
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:53.440]  information you're linking to articles that other people have put up there you're hacking our
[3:28:53.440 --> 3:28:59.120]  election and we got to do something about that you are actually by expressing a political opinion
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:05.120]  with your editorial content she says you are helping one candidate over another and so the
[3:29:05.120 --> 3:29:10.960]  federal elections commission needs to step in and monitor what the news media is doing they
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:16.880]  need to put themselves over the first amendment that's what democrat and revel said now she has
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:23.360]  stepped down from the federal elections commission that's good but now she's out there saying we
[3:29:23.360 --> 3:29:29.200]  need to do this on facebook because facebook is even more important and we got to go to facebook
[3:29:29.200 --> 3:29:33.280]  we got to go to twitter we got to go to social media accounts and we have to exercise political
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:38.320]  censorship these are the people who won't take down child porn but they want to take down politics
[3:29:38.320 --> 3:29:44.480]  stay with us we'll be right back with kaya jones
[3:29:48.240 --> 3:29:54.960]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.120 --> 3:30:02.880]  you've heard of edward bernese as the father of propaganda right but do you know who the
[3:30:02.880 --> 3:30:07.920]  grandfather of propaganda is his name was george creel and he was the chairman of wait for it the
[3:30:07.920 --> 3:30:13.040]  committee on public information that's right the cpi was established by president woodrow wilson
[3:30:13.040 --> 3:30:19.520]  by executive order 2594 on april 13th 1917 just over a hundred years ago the purpose of the cpi
[3:30:19.520 --> 3:30:24.000]  was to influence american public opinion towards supporting us participation in world war one
[3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:29.040]  via a prolonged propaganda effort the committee used newsprint posters radio telegraph cable and
[3:30:29.040 --> 3:30:33.280]  movies to broadcast its message michael sweeney who wrote the book secrets of victory said every
[3:30:33.280 --> 3:30:37.520]  war story had been censored somewhere along the line at the source in transit are in the newspaper
[3:30:37.520 --> 3:30:42.880]  offices in accordance with voluntary rules established by the cpi and who do you think worked at the
[3:30:42.880 --> 3:30:48.160]  committee of public information none other than edwin bernese who directed the latin news service
[3:30:48.160 --> 3:30:54.080]  the cpi was disbanded by an act of congress in june 30th 1919 we now know them as cnn ms mbc

[3:33:19.520 --> 3:33:23.200]  welcome back to the alex joneshow i'm david night we're going to be talking to kaya jones
[3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:28.000]  here in just a moment she contacted us and she said she was very concerned that as we see east
[3:33:28.000 --> 3:33:33.600]  are approaching there really hasn't been much discussion about the attacks that happened
[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:38.560]  last sunday on palm sunday in egypt and i agree with her i think that's absolutely i covered it on
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:45.840]  the nightly news but we've had the issues with syria and uh other politics have really swamped
[3:33:45.840 --> 3:33:51.680]  this i think it's very interesting how selective the media is in terms of what they turn try to
[3:33:51.680 --> 3:33:58.000]  focus on we don't see pictures of people dying in these egyptian churches we just see the pictures
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:02.720]  that they want to see of want us to see of people who are dying in the specific areas that they
[3:34:02.720 --> 3:34:08.400]  want to attack and we have to understand how big this problem is in egypt the christian population
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:14.880]  is about six to 18 percent it's a very wide range because it's difficult to get accurate figures
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:20.400]  why is it difficult to get accurate figures because they have to do it in hiding and let me give you
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:25.360]  an example of this there's an article on bright bar today talking about how one of these uh
[3:34:25.360 --> 3:34:32.480]  coptic orthodox diocese and minna has had to cancel Easter celebrations because of the threats the
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:37.840]  violence but also over the morning of all the attacks that happened there and i think it's
[3:34:37.840 --> 3:34:41.920]  interesting when we look at this they say of course this has been going on for quite some time they've
[3:34:41.920 --> 3:34:48.160]  had 28 people now have been arrested for ties to the planning and the financing of these attacks
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:53.280]  it's a very widespread persecution that's going on here they say that this particular bombing that
[3:34:53.280 --> 3:34:58.240]  happened in alexandria the guy as he was passing through the metal detector you can see that just
[3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:02.480]  as i'm talking about that right there on the monitor they have a metal detector set up to try to
[3:35:02.480 --> 3:35:07.360]  protect them from the terrorists who want to kill people in the churches and so what does he do and
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:12.000]  we've said this about the tsa metal detectors how ineffective that is you mass people together
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:16.800]  there wasn't a big crowd of people at that metal detector at that moment not as big as it would have
[3:35:16.800 --> 3:35:22.480]  been and in an airport but still killed a lot of people blew himself up as he was going through
[3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:27.200]  the metal detector but here you know we talk about how many people there are that are christians
[3:35:27.200 --> 3:35:32.640]  in egypt here's one of the reasons why it's not easy to get a number on that they point out that in
[3:35:32.640 --> 3:35:38.560]  a lot of the villages where they are afraid to actually have a building a church where people
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:44.480]  can go they have to keep a very low profile and what they do is they go to a wall and they draw a
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:50.880]  cross on it they hold their ceremonies and then they run away that's persecution and that's what
[3:35:50.880 --> 3:35:57.760]  we need to remember this easter as we're safely in our churches and think about the fact folks
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:04.720]  that this can come to america if we don't wake up to what is happening with this massive migration
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:12.800]  we create wars in syria we create regime changes in syria which creates chaos war and terrorism in
[3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:17.440]  those areas and then we say we've got a refugee crisis that we created with our regime change
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:23.040]  policies and we have to bring those people in we have to import that chaos we have to import that
[3:36:23.040 --> 3:36:29.280]  terrorism that's the grand strategy we need to wake up to that and cut it off at the source regime
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:33.760]  change we've seen it happen in libya and it's about to happen again in syria now i want to go to
[3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:38.240]  kaya jones she began her music career at a very young age as a classically trained violinist she

[3:36:49.520 --> 3:36:56.640]  kayajones.com welcome kaya thank you for having me tell us your concerns about what's going on you
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:01.120]  contacted us and said this is something we really need to talk about and we agree we need to talk
[3:37:01.120 --> 3:37:05.280]  about what's going on in egypt especially this weekend as you heard me say they have had to
[3:37:05.280 --> 3:37:12.560]  cancel uh easter services and one jurisdiction and the other people are having to basically hide
[3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:19.920]  to even get together to worship well you know this this is an attack against the cross everyone
[3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:26.800]  needs to understand that this is not an attack on just christians it's the it's our doctrine
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:34.000]  it's our belief in a hole being attacked and so it's scary to watch the news continuously
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:39.680]  say things about our president say things about what's going on in the world and you know two
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:37:47.680]  minutes has shown of what's happening to christians in egypt and it was just you know passed over
[3:37:47.680 --> 3:37:55.120]  luckily andre soriano who designed uh the make america great again dress for joy he um he sent
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:02.480]  all of us this incredible video that was the truth of what happened inside of the church that
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:11.200]  uh killed uh 47 they're not sure if it's 45 or 47 from all the different reports um and it was
[3:38:11.200 --> 3:38:16.800]  someone then taking their phone because you know the feed had been cut and now taking their phone
[3:38:16.800 --> 3:38:24.160]  saying you you need to see this wow and how could you not respond you know in that moment to me it
[3:38:24.160 --> 3:38:29.680]  was very clear that this is something's wrong when you know we're talking about a a murderous
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:36.880]  mother in america who gets off you know out of her sentence and and now has a reality show is the
[3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:44.880]  key topic um you know and we're barely talking about christians and what's going on and that this
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:50.560]  is against our doctrine this is against this is not just christians this is the cross i think
[3:38:50.560 --> 3:38:54.480]  that's a very important point you start out by saying uh this is an attack on the cross because
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:39:01.120]  muslims see jesus as a prophet and and so they say we honor jesus and so forth and so on what they
[3:39:01.120 --> 3:39:07.200]  hate is the cross they hate what we celebrate here on good friday and on easter sunday the fact
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:12.400]  that uh jesus died and was raised again on the third day that is the offense to them and so that is
[3:39:12.400 --> 3:39:17.680]  why they are focusing on this particular time especially now this is not something that they
[3:39:17.680 --> 3:39:23.840]  only did they did this again at christmas we had in the same uh general area in egypt they had about
[3:39:23.840 --> 3:39:28.640]  30 people that were killed and an attack in the cyanide peninsula they've had hundreds of christians
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:33.360]  have to flee to uh for safety out of that area and of course there were two attacks that happened
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:39.920]  on palm sunday but that's the core thing they focus on these uh holidays that celebrate aspects of
[3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:44.800]  jesus's life that they don't like the doctrine that they don't like so that's when they go out and
[3:39:44.800 --> 3:39:50.880]  kill people over doctrine and that's what we have to understand what is at the basis of this and the
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:57.040]  other part of this is the fact that as general flan has pointed out this is not just a religious
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:03.680]  persecution this is also a political and legal uh system all of it is tied together everybody
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:11.040]  all these liberals who uh hate any possible tie of church and state in our country they're perfectly
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:16.560]  fine with mosque and state and that's the amazing thing that really makes my head spin the fact that
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:22.160]  they would embrace people like the lgbt community and then embrace this religion that throws them
[3:40:22.160 --> 3:40:28.240]  off the roofs they would hate anything that smacks of religious expression and christianity
[3:40:28.240 --> 3:40:33.840]  but then they would embrace the people that hillary clinton had speak for her uh i always call him
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:37.920]  sharia khan i don't remember his real name anymore but the guy that she had introduced her
[3:40:38.640 --> 3:40:43.920]  as a guy who has been a an advocate of sharia law it is a legal and political system it is not
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:49.120]  just a a doctrine and they will kill you if they don't agree with your doctrine but it is also a
[3:40:49.120 --> 3:40:55.520]  legal system yeah i mean you know the lgbt community is very near and dear to my heart um i've done so
[3:40:55.520 --> 3:41:00.560]  much work with them and i i don't think i would have much of a career if hadn't been for the support
[3:41:00.560 --> 3:41:08.160]  i've received from them the same time you know all religion has offended or hurt or said things to
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:13.920]  the gay community and so that's kind of their stance is it's all in one and i've had these discussions
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:18.240]  with many of my gay friends that have said you know but it's all in one and i'm like well look
[3:41:19.120 --> 3:41:25.040]  there are concentration camps going on right now rounding up gay men and what will be next gay
[3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:32.240]  women gay sympathizers christians i mean hitler didn't just start with you know the jews in germany
[3:41:32.240 --> 3:41:36.480]  that was where he began but that's not where he ended yeah so where does it end where does it
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:42.240]  really end and that's going on right now you know and people don't even know about it when you look
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:48.000]  at what's going on in christianity take the westboro baptist for example that is a microscopic
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:52.320]  fringe group that doesn't represent mainstream christianity christians reject that uh that is
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:56.800]  not christian doctrine they have absolutely no power and yet they don't have a problem with
[3:41:56.800 --> 3:42:03.200]  saudi arabia where the government has religious police where they are enacting sharia punishment
[3:42:03.200 --> 3:42:11.200]  against lgbt people there are allies and at the same time we're told that we need to embrace islam
[3:42:11.200 --> 3:42:16.160]  i just don't get the double think that's going on there oh there's a lot of double think i think the
[3:42:16.160 --> 3:42:21.680]  key thing is we have to keep talking about what's going on in cheshire there are concentration
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:26.720]  camps going on right now and that's what's happening to the gay community there people
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:31.600]  need to understand this people need to also know what's going on to christians around the globe
[3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:39.600]  or to anyone that is not okay with the faith that is coming against us and i have a lot of muslim
[3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:44.880]  friends at this point i asked you need to speak up and speak out if you're not okay with what's
[3:42:44.880 --> 3:42:50.560]  going on if this is really the religion of peace then you need to speak we need to start talking
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:56.800]  because what it's looking like is a bunch of people not speaking on what's going on and and also
[3:42:56.800 --> 3:43:03.600]  genociding their own people yeah so it is crucial that we keep speaking on about it it is crucial
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:08.400]  that we keep discussing and that we don't just shut the door on this narrative this has been
[3:43:08.400 --> 3:43:15.040]  going on for a long time coptic christians are so important to our doctrine they were created
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:22.880]  in four uh 42 ab so this is 42 years after christ this is something that is important for us to
[3:43:22.880 --> 3:43:30.560]  understand this at the beginning and they're they're being demolished yes and and we can see
[3:43:30.560 --> 3:43:35.360]  that as we look at the other ancient areas you go through the bible you look at all the different
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:40.080]  churches that all wrote to you know they had very strong christian populations they're all muslim
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:47.200]  now and every trace of that culture that civilization those people has been eradicated and that is
[3:43:47.200 --> 3:43:52.960]  what is going really going on in egypt islam is the essence of intolerance and that's why
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:44:00.240]  again i get back to this double thing how can these people preach tolerance and um and yet
[3:44:00.240 --> 3:44:05.440]  embrace the most intolerant of religions where everywhere that it is gone they have eradicated
[3:44:05.440 --> 3:44:10.480]  everything they shot up the face of the sphinx because they don't like statues i mean it's not
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:15.280]  just christian culture it's every other culture if they don't like the symbols they destroy them
[3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:19.680]  and then they build on top of them one of the things i think this interesting guy is a story
[3:44:19.680 --> 3:44:25.040]  from breitbart that came out earlier in the week and it was about a cartoon artist that worked at
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:32.080]  marvel comics and he started in interjecting uh islamic references but also political references
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:36.880]  i think that's the key thing uh this indonesian comic artist that was a new comic series called
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:43.440]  x-men gold and he put in a feature to reference to the quran that urges muslim muslims not to take
[3:44:43.440 --> 3:44:49.360]  christians and jews as allies whoever is an ally to them the verse says who among you then indeed he
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:54.560]  is one of them so in other words you're with us or you're against us and then as part of this he
[3:44:54.560 --> 3:45:02.480]  also put up a protest against a political opponent uh who referred to the verse many muslims saw this
[3:45:02.480 --> 3:45:08.320]  as an act of blasphemy because he pushed back against that so uh they started these uh demonstrations
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:16.000]  on the 20 on the 2nd of december last year and so the number 212 has now become a symbol of political
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:23.920]  opposition to a guy in indonesia who is actually tolerant of other religions so now they want to
[3:45:23.920 --> 3:45:30.880]  get him out of office they want him prosecuted for blasphemy in indonesia and uh he put these
[3:45:30.880 --> 3:45:36.080]  symbols inside a a marvel comic now marvel said we don't have anything to do with it
[3:45:36.080 --> 3:45:40.320]  they don't reflect the views of the writer the editors or anyone here but then he got on to
[3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:44.320]  social media and started to confirm it one of his other writers said well that's it
[3:45:45.920 --> 3:45:50.000]  media works yeah so so we know that that's what he was doing they caught him on it they distanced
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:56.560]  themselves from it but that's the subtlety with which they use this uh it's in comic books it's in
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:01.040]  your entertainment and it's in politics and when you push back against it even if it's somebody
[3:46:01.040 --> 3:46:05.920]  that introduces hillary clinton who is a proponent of sharia law we're told it's intolerant if we
[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:14.160]  point that out yeah no it's not intolerant we need to know as christians and as jews or as anyone
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:21.360]  who's a non denomination that believes in an above um you can connect with god anywhere any place
[3:46:21.360 --> 3:46:28.080]  they can attack our churches we can connect with god anytime and any place so they can have this
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:35.360]  you know this ideology to come against everything if you will anything that's of art or uh
[3:46:35.360 --> 3:46:42.880]  religion or um freedom and that to me is a very strong ideology and we need to be careful with
[3:46:42.880 --> 3:46:48.800]  sympathizing with this because this is not something that you can sympathize with you cannot sympathize
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:55.840]  with anyone that is thinking it's okay to go into a holy space you know i might not believe in other
[3:46:55.840 --> 3:47:01.680]  religions because i am christian but i will tell you this you do not denounce you do not go into a
[3:47:01.680 --> 3:47:09.360]  church a synagogue a temple or a mosque and cause problems that is just at what at what point have
[3:47:09.360 --> 3:47:16.000]  we crossed the line and there is a there is a line and it has been crossed and when are we going to
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:21.840]  do something about it and say something about it and start to show your crosses start to wear them
[3:47:21.840 --> 3:47:26.720]  if everyone's happy well there was just an incident wearing the hijab we should be happy
[3:47:26.720 --> 3:47:32.160]  as i am to sport my cross as we all should if they're okay with sporting the hijab we should
[3:47:32.160 --> 3:47:37.360]  do the same absolutely this week hi you probably are familiar with this in australia there was a
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:42.400]  young man who and again i think he was a greek orthodox just they had a large cross which is
[3:47:42.400 --> 3:47:49.280]  what they wear and he was attacked in australia and at a public train station subway station
[3:47:49.280 --> 3:47:54.800]  something like that by a gang of muslim individuals who beat him who removed his cross his his
[3:47:54.800 --> 3:48:00.160]  girlfriend tried to intervene two muslim girls attacked her and the interesting thing most interesting
[3:48:00.160 --> 3:48:06.240]  thing about this i think is the fact that there were i believe five uniformed officers there on
[3:48:06.240 --> 3:48:12.400]  the platform who stood by and did nothing and when people complain about that they said that's not
[3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:17.840]  my job not my job man i'm here to stop people who are jumping over the turnstiles because it didn't
[3:48:17.840 --> 3:48:22.320]  be a dollar to ride the subway or something i'm not gonna help anybody either it's not your job or
[3:48:22.320 --> 3:48:29.200]  my job either just speak out on certain issues we're you know i'm a singer i you know also in a
[3:48:29.200 --> 3:48:33.440]  record company i'm a performer you know i came out in support of trump but at this point it
[3:48:33.440 --> 3:48:38.720]  doesn't matter whether you're a singer you sweep the street or you're a police officer we need to
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:44.240]  know what's right and wrong and right now what's going on in the world is wrong we cannot have this
[3:48:44.240 --> 3:48:51.040]  continue it starts in one space and it moves had we stayed in the middle east and not just pulled
[3:48:51.040 --> 3:48:57.600]  out we would not have been in the situation where isis is now spread everywhere i mean i wish trump
[3:48:57.600 --> 3:49:02.800]  had come along sooner because i was so happy when i saw what he did i was so happy yeah i just hope
[3:49:02.800 --> 3:49:08.240]  that he doesn't you know one of the things that's going on in syria of course is Assad is one of the
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:13.280]  most secular government so we've had there there's been less persecution of christians in that country
[3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:18.000]  before isis came in there was less persecution there than anywhere else and what i'm concerned about
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:22.960]  is that this is going to degenerate into a situation like we've had even in other places
[3:49:22.960 --> 3:49:26.320]  where the u.s. government has gone in other countries where there used to be a christian
[3:49:26.320 --> 3:49:31.280]  population after our involvement that went down to essentially zero i hope that doesn't happen
[3:49:31.840 --> 3:49:36.960]  in syria as well i think the little takeaway that we have to come away with this is that we
[3:49:36.960 --> 3:49:43.440]  don't turn into the picture of what we saw with these uniform people on the platform
[3:49:43.440 --> 3:49:48.720]  we have to do something and so what can we do we don't always we're not always there when somebody

[3:54:11.680 --> 3:54:19.360]  and wired magazine major leak suggests that the nsa was deep in the middle east banking system
[3:54:19.360 --> 3:54:28.160]  and of course we've seen brennan cia and others as as really a lot of people reported how close
[3:54:28.160 --> 3:54:33.840]  he is that he's really a muslim insider there's been a lot of reports about that i can't document
[3:54:33.840 --> 3:54:40.480]  that but boy this is very very very interesting that the nsa why is the nsa involved in any bank
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:47.120]  let alone a middle eastern bank that's amazing headline i want to go back to the news and i
[3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:55.920]  want to talk about where we go now how do we win something so that we don't lose big time in 2018
[3:54:55.920 --> 3:55:01.840]  so that this reform movement isn't shut out before we go back to that i just want to report a
[3:55:01.840 --> 3:55:07.520]  point out to you that we have the easter mega special that we put in place at infowarstore.com
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:13.680]  anywhere from 25 to 30 and more office selected products let me give you some of the ones that
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:20.560]  are 25 off super male super female vitality both of those are 25 off our vitamin b12 formulation

[3:55:28.880 --> 3:55:38.240]  are all 25 off 30 off brain force plus and 33 off caveman and we put that's an extended special
[3:55:38.240 --> 3:55:44.400]  that we've kept along with those other items that we put on a sale for easter remember caveman is
[3:55:44.400 --> 3:55:49.840]  we call it caveman because it's paleo nutrition it's one of the key things in it is bone broth but
[3:55:49.840 --> 3:55:56.160]  it's also got seven other primal super foods that help support healthy muscles fight free radicals
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:56:02.960]  we have things like chaga mushrooms turmeric root b pollen along with that bone broth a very
[3:56:02.960 --> 3:56:09.200]  effective paleo nutrition formulation that combines cutting-edge nutraceutical science with the ancient
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:15.440]  arts of nutrition and that's what bone broth is about and you can get that with a it's got a great
[3:56:15.440 --> 3:56:21.120]  chocolate flavor too as well you can find that infowarstore.com 33 off it sold off very quickly
[3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:27.040]  when we first introduced it it's now back in stock and it's at 33 off as well all right let's talk
[3:56:27.040 --> 3:56:32.800]  about what we do to move forward because we've got this war going on between and within the house
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:37.680]  between the house Freedom Caucus the people said no we campaign in one on the principle of repeal
[3:56:37.680 --> 3:56:42.400]  we're going to have repeal and then you've got the centrist group they call them the Tuesday group
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:48.880]  and of course the mainstream press is calling them centrist no they're statists actually
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:55.280]  because what they're trying to do is they're trying to establish this they don't want to remove it
[3:56:55.280 --> 3:57:00.880]  they just want to manipulate it around the edges a little bit and that is a prescription for disaster
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:08.880]  let's talk about how they manipulate us in the media because we we have a war of ideas that's
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:14.720]  what's really going on folks and the battlefield is in Washington DC the way they get the high ground
[3:57:14.720 --> 3:57:19.680]  in this battlefield is by choosing the terms that they talk about and a good example of this
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:26.640]  is a story from NPR and they have all these maps and graphics and metrics that talk about health
[3:57:26.640 --> 3:57:33.280]  insurance coverage and they talk about look at how many more people got coverage under ACA
[3:57:34.400 --> 3:57:41.040]  and when you look through all these different charts they don't talk about cost you understand
[3:57:41.040 --> 3:57:47.040]  they're talking about coverage not cost the whole thing was sold to us as affordable health
[3:57:47.040 --> 3:57:52.960]  insurance they're not talking about that anymore are they this is the misdirection so when they
[3:57:52.960 --> 3:57:58.960]  really want something that is universal and not affordable and you can't have both that's that's
[3:57:58.960 --> 3:58:04.640]  the reality sorry utopia is not an option so they want universal they want the government to run it
[3:58:04.640 --> 3:58:09.840]  they call that single payer they choose the term just like they talk about instead of illegal aliens
[3:58:09.840 --> 3:58:15.440]  they call them undocumented aliens no actually they're foreign citizens who are illegally trespassing
[3:58:15.440 --> 3:58:19.840]  criminally trespassing in our country but they call them undocumented immigrants so now what
[3:58:19.840 --> 3:58:24.640]  they do is they want to focus us on coverage if that's going to be our metric we're going to lose
[3:58:24.640 --> 3:58:31.120]  this fight we have to get back to a marketplace that means we need repeal join us for our live
[3:58:31.120 --> 3:58:34.960]  broadcast three to five Mike Cernovich is here in studio he's going to be joining them there
[3:58:34.960 --> 3:58:38.480]  and tonight at seven central apm eastern for the info wars nightly news
