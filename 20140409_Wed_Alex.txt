[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:38.800]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.800 --> 00:46.040]  well we have the Nevada rancher on where over 250 armed feds with armored
[00:46.040 --> 00:53.600]  vehicles and helicopters and drones are massing to kick the open-range grazer
[00:53.600 --> 00:59.440]  off of the federal quote land over 80% of the land in Nevada is federal you
[00:59.440 --> 01:05.400]  count state it's over 90% in fact there is more federal land in Nevada than even
[01:05.400 --> 01:13.080]  in Alaska last time I checked and before it was even a territory there were
[01:13.080 --> 01:18.760]  people out there including this man's family who were grazing on that property
[01:18.760 --> 01:23.040]  and they're now stealing his cows at gunpoint and telling people they can't
[01:23.040 --> 01:28.360]  demonstrate in the town on the roads in parking lots the feds arrest anyone that
[01:28.360 --> 01:34.840]  holds up a sign this is the tyranny and the governor has gone public saying it's
[01:34.840 --> 01:38.680]  tyranny and this is how a revolution could start in this country I don't know
[01:38.680 --> 01:42.240]  what's gonna happen here I'm I frankly don't want a physical revolution to
[01:42.240 --> 01:46.920]  start I want to try to fix things in the information war the globalists want to
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.320]  get a physical war going and I've documented that and broken that down
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.200]  and they've prepared Homeland Security for that war knowing we would struggle
[01:54.200 --> 01:58.680]  against the takeover but if war must come it will so it's important to
[01:58.680 --> 02:04.000]  intensify the info war to affect the battle space the future battle space if
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.680]  things go physical and of course if things go physical the info war will be
[02:07.680 --> 02:11.680]  more important than ever to go out and engage in it and not let the showing
[02:11.680 --> 02:15.840]  effect work or they will put us in forced labor camps and that is their
[02:15.840 --> 02:22.520]  plan on record they are the equivalent of a Bolshevik takeover run by George
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.560]  Soros and others and you see them overthrowing elected governments
[02:25.560 --> 02:29.080]  everywhere and putting in tyrannies we're not the only ones going under this
[02:29.080 --> 02:35.080]  so he's going to be joining us at the start of the next hour I've got a top
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.600]  story when we come back from break that is so huge I don't even really have
[02:39.600 --> 02:46.680]  ways to describe how important it is but when we come back from break I'm going
[02:46.680 --> 02:50.520]  to get into it in fact it's so important I don't usually try to build on
[02:50.520 --> 02:58.600]  suspense in a theatrical way I just cover the news and it's it's sensational
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.360]  enough unfortunately you know it's a horror story but but but knowing the
[03:04.360 --> 03:08.080]  problems is half the battle so we can then get out of denial and do something
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.880]  about it but this is so big that I don't even have the words to describe it
[03:12.880 --> 03:16.000]  right now so we're going to go to break when we come back I'm going to try to
[03:16.000 --> 03:26.200]  cover this top story first this is just absolutely incredible in how over the
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.760]  top important it is and we're going to cover it when we come back I'm just
[03:31.760 --> 03:37.560]  gonna I'm not gonna tell you what it is I'm gonna cover when we come back we will
[03:37.560 --> 03:44.800]  also get into mass stabbing at Pennsylvania High School injures 20
[03:44.800 --> 03:48.760]  will they call for banning knives or maybe have shot bracelets and everyone
[03:48.760 --> 03:53.680]  says somebody can't stab 20 people with a knife major bug called heart bleed
[03:53.680 --> 03:59.320]  exposes internet data that's a big deal scientists seek climate friendly cow
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.720]  with the future that's their excuse to genetically engineer animals now in a
[04:03.720 --> 04:08.800]  total rewrite of the genetic code of the planet very dangerous we've also got
[04:08.800 --> 04:12.840]  big news on the stock market is it really rebounding or is it a dead cat
[04:12.840 --> 04:19.240]  bounce at CNBC we've got Hank Aaron comparing Republicans that oppose
[04:19.240 --> 04:27.680]  Obamacare to the KKK Hank Aaron well how sad that he's such a such a race
[04:27.680 --> 04:32.800]  baiter using race as a weapon but it's all part of the new race cult you know
[04:32.800 --> 04:38.800]  Jay-Z with the Kill Whitey movement all financed by Viacom all financed by MTV
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.920]  this is how they want us fighting with each other while the foreign banks
[04:41.920 --> 04:46.640]  rob us while they abort 52% of blacks of course Hank Aaron ain't gonna say a
[04:46.640 --> 04:51.520]  word about that that's the real cook less clan he doesn't care though just
[04:51.520 --> 04:55.360]  feels too good to grandstand and you know say he has the moral authority over
[04:55.360 --> 05:00.800]  everyone is a race pimp like Al Sharpton we'll be right back a chemical spill
[05:00.800 --> 05:04.920]  contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia County this year alone over
[05:04.920 --> 05:08.600]  300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated what
[05:08.600 --> 05:12.520]  are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water it's force

[05:23.260 --> 05:27.240]  county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week few filters

[06:01.120 --> 06:05.040]  controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.960]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major
[06:08.960 --> 06:14.200]  networks are state-run we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has
[06:14.200 --> 06:17.560]  become a political weapon against the Second Amendment pushes Obamacare
[06:17.560 --> 06:22.000]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.560]  important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media we are the

[08:31.880 --> 08:41.200]  day of April 2014 I am your host Alex Jones we're here weekdays 12 noon to
[08:41.200 --> 08:51.160]  3 p.m. Eastern that's 9 a.m. to noon Pacific 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Mountain 11
[08:51.160 --> 08:55.760]  a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time I come to you from the former state of
[08:55.760 --> 09:01.960]  Texas occupied by the global crime syndicate on record from FEMA region
[09:01.960 --> 09:08.560]  6 Austin transmitting worldwide and admitting that we're occupied admitting
[09:08.560 --> 09:13.400]  that the globalists have taken over via fraud is half the battle admitting the
[09:13.400 --> 09:19.680]  battle space admitting where we are admitting the psychology and nomenclature
[09:19.680 --> 09:29.440]  and MO of our usurpers of our hijackers is the beginning of the end of them now
[09:29.440 --> 09:33.520]  ladies and gentlemen that is not rhetoric you just heard if you research
[09:33.520 --> 09:38.840]  it it's cold hard facts and more and more even in academic circles
[09:38.840 --> 09:44.040]  regardless of political affiliation people are lining up with reality really
[09:44.040 --> 09:50.560]  assessing politically what we're under a scientific takeover at the end of which
[09:50.560 --> 09:57.720]  humanity no longer exist now that's heavy but that's the plan it's beyond any
[09:57.720 --> 10:03.360]  captain America winner soldier and by the way at the bottom of the hour I'll
[10:03.360 --> 10:11.040]  give you my review of that I saw last night I am not a comic book fantasy fan
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.840]  I like science fiction and things but I have to say this film was extremely
[10:15.840 --> 10:23.800]  good and I guarantee you and we actually know someone that was big on the
[10:23.800 --> 10:29.000]  production of the film we're gonna contact a most writers are very quiet and
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.560]  probably won't want to come on but guaranteed the the two writers of the
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.640]  new captain America winner soldier are listeners of the show and spoiler alert
[10:38.640 --> 10:42.160]  ladies and gentlemen that's why everybody that went and saw it said it's
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.240]  your show and I kept getting hundreds of emails and people on the street I had a
[10:46.240 --> 10:54.200]  guy yesterday when I was downtown to go see it on the street say hey man you
[10:54.200 --> 10:59.640]  gotta see Captain America it's your show well it's not my show it's what Dr. Bob
[10:59.640 --> 11:07.320]  Bowman said they had in the air in 1979 a drone decapitation system to kill
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.200]  world leaders in one hour with D.U. Sabo rounds that go up to 38,000 miles an
[11:13.200 --> 11:19.080]  hour that are non-atomic but have the kinetic energy of a multi-megaton
[11:19.080 --> 11:27.360]  hydrogen bomb and will kill people in bunkers even five miles under mountains
[11:27.360 --> 11:31.440]  you can't have bases five miles out of the earth because it heats up you have
[11:31.440 --> 11:34.960]  to build them under five mile tall mountains and then you've got a 65
[11:34.960 --> 11:39.280]  degree base perfect winter summer it doesn't matter I'm going off into side
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.800]  issues the point is is that by the 70s they had drone robot remote controlled
[11:44.800 --> 11:51.640]  Skynet in the air and that's what this movie is and it's about a false flag by
[11:51.640 --> 12:00.160]  Hydra which is the Bilderberg group in control and it explains the police the
[12:00.160 --> 12:04.520]  military everything's compartmentalized and is run by it see I'm already I'm
[12:04.520 --> 12:09.640]  already giving you the plot but I mean it's the New World Order they say New
[12:09.640 --> 12:13.280]  World Order the problem is you could say is it revelation of the method where
[12:13.280 --> 12:17.240]  they're telling us what they're doing I mean they've got the satellites in it
[12:17.240 --> 12:21.520]  that they admitted they had a decade ago that biometrically have the top of
[12:21.520 --> 12:25.160]  your head scan and your shoulder scan with a hundred percent biometric from
[12:25.160 --> 12:30.160]  space that's why they need to get a biometric scan on the ground to then
[12:30.160 --> 12:36.240]  match it and link it geo located with the satellite to then get your body heat
[12:36.240 --> 12:41.520]  resonance fingerprint and then with that they're not going to really use in the
[12:41.520 --> 12:47.800]  more advanced systems you know sabos over taking out leaders and underground
[12:47.800 --> 12:57.360]  bunkers what they what they're deploying is blimps with radiation and
[12:57.360 --> 13:05.240]  microwave guns to cook you in your house and then you die a few months later so
[13:05.240 --> 13:08.920]  that's the real rollout so and I'm not trying to scare people with the advanced
[13:08.920 --> 13:13.800]  technology that the establishment has but that's why they're on such power
[13:13.800 --> 13:20.280]  trips and only a complete break with the system realizing it's an exterminist
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.440]  proto-Hitlerian eugenics program and that's what this movie's about is they're
[13:25.440 --> 13:30.160]  going to kill with computers that have already algorithmed who challenges a
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.520]  New World Order global tyranny they're gonna kill 20 million people with the
[13:35.520 --> 13:45.360]  Skynet suborbital drones and they've got to kill the 20 million people to bring
[13:45.360 --> 13:49.160]  in their New World Order but it's not going to be 20 million folks it's going
[13:49.160 --> 13:56.240]  to be seven plus billion or 99% of whatever the population is when they
[13:56.240 --> 14:01.880]  trigger the main extinction event which could be airborne super Ebola cross with
[14:01.880 --> 14:08.800]  mouth pox nanotech type nerve gas I mean we just don't know the Intel I've
[14:08.800 --> 14:12.560]  gathered over the years a lot of its 20 30 years old and what they already had
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.920]  on the drawing board was so advanced and so evil the Air Force admits 15 years
[14:17.920 --> 14:22.600]  ago that they had completed construction of antimatter weapons that can
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.000]  destroy the entire planet the Air Force gave a press briefing that the
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.600]  San Francisco Chronicle and AP picked up anybody wants to look it up you can
[14:29.600 --> 14:34.360]  they was put out as a direct threat to the Chinese and the Russians you could
[14:34.360 --> 14:40.480]  say it's a bluff but then you look at some of the MIT Stanford and Los Alamos
[14:40.480 --> 14:44.840]  stuff that's going on with the fission fusion black hole creation the word is
[14:44.840 --> 14:49.240]  for the theoretical physicists and others that they have developed the basic
[14:49.240 --> 14:56.680]  precursors of antimatter warheads and if they want they can make one that
[14:56.680 --> 15:02.040]  will destroy the whole solar system so the ability and the nihilistic
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.880]  exterminist view to be able to do this does not make you God just because you
[15:07.880 --> 15:15.280]  know max Planck's equations gave you the atomic bomb and that equation was from
[15:15.280 --> 15:22.040]  1900 and 1901 when he published the equations that were expanded on by
[15:22.040 --> 15:27.640]  Albert Einstein and we're not in 1900 we're in 2014 folks and they've gone
[15:27.640 --> 15:31.560]  way past atomic and hydrogen bombs just let me give you a little news flash and
[15:31.560 --> 15:37.840]  that's why they're phasing out the human army now going to the pure robot that's
[15:37.840 --> 15:40.400]  why they're moving into this and so I guess I've already given you the Captain
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.000]  America update I mean maybe I'll do a special report for the nightly news or
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.680]  something tonight because I just pretty much gave it to you right there I need
[15:46.680 --> 15:50.720]  to write some notes and cover it all but again why it's so important because the
[15:50.720 --> 16:00.320]  general public doesn't get their news anymore from news news is meant to be
[16:00.320 --> 16:04.040]  discredited by the system destroyed where government just puts out press
[16:04.040 --> 16:08.600]  releases that then pretty much just get accepted as reality because there's no
[16:08.600 --> 16:12.440]  alternative that's the world they want once they shut off the free web and
[16:12.440 --> 16:16.880]  then everything else is just Michelle Obama's a rock star Hillary's a rock
[16:16.880 --> 16:22.160]  star being trendy leaving your husband's wonderful you know taking
[16:22.160 --> 16:29.000]  vaccines is sexy drinking you know GMO fluoride garbage is good on and on and on
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.480]  80 plus percent of people only get their news now from entertainment and they've
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.240]  legalized what's already been going on for a long time this year domestic
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.200]  funding of lies and propaganda you can look that up if we have the business
[16:41.200 --> 16:44.880]  insider article up there from last year they've already been doing this but now
[16:44.880 --> 16:50.840]  they've publicly turned Pentagon psyops and 18 private merc groups as well as
[16:50.840 --> 16:55.440]  15 intelligence groups loose on everyone and now they're just running
[16:55.440 --> 16:59.760]  around everywhere spewing disinfo but I've seen it have a reverse lensing
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.000]  effect and actually has demoralized the globalist and it's just completed the
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.240]  decompartmentalization that that that we've helped promote and push as a key
[17:13.240 --> 17:19.200]  breach of the enemy complex and now the establishment even even the
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.120]  psychopathic control freaks that are in it realized they're going to be
[17:22.120 --> 17:25.600]  destroyed as well in this and now their basic survival instincts are kicking in
[17:25.600 --> 17:31.120]  and the more and the more moral members of the power structure and the
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.440]  establishment now realize it's all true and the worst of the worst have been
[17:35.440 --> 17:41.280]  given control and now people really have a decision on whether they want to end
[17:41.280 --> 17:45.160]  the human experiences we've known it and buy into this thing that we're ugly and
[17:45.160 --> 17:49.480]  bad and the age of humans is over and just turn everything over to the
[17:49.480 --> 17:54.360]  transcendent man that even if it's real even if it's feasible we're not going to

[24:26.520 --> 24:30.560]  itself and it is looks like it's bringing down commerce right now major
[24:30.560 --> 24:34.640]  governments from Canada to Germany are announcing or saying they're looking at

[25:09.040 --> 25:16.920]  they agree and they say it's common sense but it's why the NSA targets people
[25:16.920 --> 25:20.400]  it's why the media targets people it's why they bring out any type of petty
[25:20.400 --> 25:24.760]  dirt on good congressmen and women or good governors that stand up for freedom
[25:24.760 --> 25:29.560]  but you know had a girlfriend five years ago on the side or didn't pay their
[25:29.560 --> 25:34.520]  taxes right or you these are the type of things that they throw you in prison

[26:01.960 --> 26:07.040]  the emails where they said from the SEC we're gonna put you in jail for making

[35:08.840 --> 35:13.560]  gentlemen I've interviewed the police officers on this show like Don Browning
[35:13.560 --> 35:22.240]  and others who saw the other cops and and doctors killed at Oklahoma City the
[35:22.240 --> 35:26.320]  doctor that showed up and saw the feds in there with the bombs they killed him
[35:26.320 --> 35:29.520]  cop of the year that showed up and carried out a bunch of people on his back
[35:29.520 --> 35:35.000]  Terrence Gekke they killed him tortured him to death and I've talked to the cops
[35:35.000 --> 35:38.640]  like Don Browning the head of the canine unit Oklahoma City where the FBI walked
[35:38.640 --> 35:42.480]  into his office and said you and your wife are gonna be killed if you don't
[35:42.480 --> 35:46.160]  shut up and then he was told again in the hallway listen we're not playing
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.840]  around but you keep your mouth shut and that guy I looked him up was a highly
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.040]  decorated Vietnam veteran Marine a highly decorated police officer and let me
[35:57.040 --> 36:02.120]  tell you he turned white and gulped on air when I said say the names of the FBI
[36:02.120 --> 36:07.920]  agents and don't you think I had a little tingle when I did that you got to
[36:07.920 --> 36:14.680]  commit to this and you got to tell the truth about it or all dead down the road
[36:14.680 --> 36:20.320]  pure evil's coming in you don't play games with it
[36:20.320 --> 36:27.520]  there's no way to beat it unless you stand up against it all the way I want
[36:27.520 --> 36:34.440]  everybody to understand that and I know you don't feel like heroes out there I
[36:34.440 --> 36:39.320]  know good people aren't on power trips good people are humble but you got to
[36:39.320 --> 36:43.080]  get past all that and realize you're good deep down you've got skills and
[36:43.080 --> 36:46.520]  gifts God gave you and I don't know all the answers I don't know what you see or
[36:46.520 --> 36:50.040]  what skills you've got but I know you've got them and it's time for you to take
[36:50.040 --> 36:54.680]  action against the enemy in the information war to expose them and to
[36:54.680 --> 36:58.560]  call them out I've told you over and over again we start calling Obama out as
[36:58.560 --> 37:01.680]  a criminal John Boehner out as a criminal for colluding with his criminal
[37:01.680 --> 37:07.200]  Obamacare you start calling out Eric Holder as a criminal you start telling
[37:07.200 --> 37:12.120]  them that you're aware of what they're doing and you get past that intimidation
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.560]  if you're a talk show host or if you're a police officer or if you're a school
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.680]  teacher or if you're a judge I don't care who you are I talked to state judges
[37:21.680 --> 37:25.480]  I've talked to federal judges I've talked to high-level police officers who were
[37:25.480 --> 37:28.920]  scared and wish they could tell the truth by everything but don't know what
[37:28.920 --> 37:32.800]  to do they're waiting for somebody else to have the courage look they're in
[37:32.800 --> 37:36.440]  somebody else there's not a secret room of other people out there they're gonna
[37:36.440 --> 37:41.440]  get this job done we've got to do it and it doesn't mean we're perfect doesn't
[37:41.440 --> 37:45.000]  mean we got all the answers doesn't mean we won't make mistakes but you know what
[37:45.000 --> 37:50.000]  in the final equation we got a serious crisis on our hands the bankers are
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.280]  crazy enough to make 40 to 1 bets with other people's money steal their bank
[37:54.280 --> 38:00.680]  accounts like MF global and not get in trouble for it and they do that on
[38:00.680 --> 38:04.320]  thousands of things we could sit here and list where they've now reached that
[38:04.320 --> 38:09.680]  historical point where they're getting away with bloody murder in front of
[38:09.680 --> 38:16.600]  every one and the reason no one will call Holder out for fast and furious CBS
[38:16.600 --> 38:19.560]  News got the documents we already had guests on about it but they got the
[38:19.560 --> 38:22.840]  documents to their credit they got rid of the woman by the way that brought that
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.560]  out for CBS News she's gone she paid that they said we're gonna blame the
[38:27.560 --> 38:30.920]  Second Amendment that's why we're doing this of course the holder got caught
[38:30.920 --> 38:34.520]  lying they had press conferences a year before it broke saying we've got
[38:34.520 --> 38:38.520]  Operation Gun Runner where we're tracking guns in the Mexico they were
[38:38.520 --> 38:42.440]  hiding it in plain view in case it ever came out but then they double backed and
[38:42.440 --> 38:49.160]  lied about it and said they never knew about it we have them they can all be
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.640]  arrested right now and I don't want to be held hostage by these people anymore
[38:53.640 --> 39:00.240]  I'm not gonna live in fear of a bunch of scum I mean look at big sis look at
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.920]  Janet Reno look at Eric Holder look at Obama look at Hillary Clinton look at
[39:05.920 --> 39:15.000]  Bill Clinton a kleptocratic pervert a sick thug punk thrust on us by a sickening
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.360]  degenerate establishment and look at him all shriveled looks like he's a
[39:18.360 --> 39:24.640]  reanimated corpse look what evil does to you look at this piece of trash I don't
[39:24.640 --> 39:28.280]  want to live like this I don't want to have humanity turned over to these
[39:28.280 --> 39:34.640]  people so the victory of all the incredible news I've gotten the rancher
[39:34.640 --> 39:38.640]  coming on the standing of the feds and the rest of it is deciding that hey
[39:38.640 --> 39:42.080]  none of us are perfect nothing's ever gonna be absolutely you know it's a
[39:42.080 --> 39:46.680]  process but we got a really bad wave of corruption going on right now that is
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.480]  gonna bring us completely down and ruin and wreck everything and ruin
[39:50.480 --> 39:55.000]  prosperity and start giant wars and really create some horrible situations
[39:55.000 --> 40:02.120]  so this elite can stay in control folks it's the captain America analogy of
[40:02.120 --> 40:11.440]  Hydra or of specter you guys queue up specter from from Russia will love with
[40:11.440 --> 40:15.400]  the two Siamese fighting fish and they wait till the two hurt and kill each
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.880]  other and then the other one comes in in the captain America they explain we are
[40:19.880 --> 40:24.200]  a secret group of anti-human eugenicists who want to become supermen and merge
[40:24.200 --> 40:27.760]  with machines and we're gonna launch drones worldwide to decapitate world
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.880]  leadership to take over and do all of this with our AI NSA computers that
[40:32.880 --> 40:38.040]  can now predict the future that's the enemy program and now it's in movies
[40:38.040 --> 40:41.600]  like Captain America Winter Soldier are they programming us so that when you
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.200]  hear me talk about it you go oh that's just a movie or your subconscious is
[40:45.200 --> 40:50.560]  prepared or are these people concerned and this stuff's coming out most the
[40:50.560 --> 40:53.280]  time I'm able to get a hold of the directors and the writers they go no
[40:53.280 --> 40:58.520]  yeah we're listeners or no we're aware of this no we're we care we we love our
[40:58.520 --> 41:03.200]  kids and I haven't gotten in contact with them and you're saying why do you
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.480]  care about Captain America because that's there coming out and saying we see
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.440]  what's going on children of men government staging the bombings
[41:10.440 --> 41:14.480]  governments release the chemicals to sterilize the population great Mexican
[41:14.480 --> 41:18.480]  director I forget his name it's the same story be for vendetta the Wachowski
[41:18.480 --> 41:23.320]  brother and sister all of this these are people that know what's going on and
[41:23.320 --> 41:29.280]  they don't like it and it's an example of what we can have congressmen calling
[41:29.280 --> 41:34.720]  out holder and saying you're a criminal you should really be in jail and saying
[41:34.720 --> 41:39.480]  and holder stamps back you better watch it buddy you don't want to go there
[41:39.480 --> 41:46.560]  getting getting him down to his basic thug level this is the guy that ran
[41:46.560 --> 41:52.160]  bare minimum the Oklahoma City cover-up he was in control of the operation we
[41:52.160 --> 41:55.720]  know the names of the FBI counterterrorism leaders who checked in the
[41:55.720 --> 41:58.600]  day before at the hotels didn't even try to cover their tracks lied and said
[41:58.600 --> 42:01.880]  their team was in Dallas they got caught they were there we know and we have
[42:01.880 --> 42:05.800]  the witnesses that saw them doing the telephone work with the gray sticks of
[42:05.800 --> 42:11.560]  butter and then holder quarterback to cover up I mean we have those emails from
[42:11.560 --> 42:21.000]  federal lawsuits I mean this is a very serious person and I'm not trying to do
[42:21.000 --> 42:24.800]  his scaring for him I'm saying let's recognize the criminals we're dealing
[42:24.800 --> 42:28.400]  with here and let's call them out for the criminals they are and they kill
[42:28.400 --> 42:31.280]  Alex Jones or set me up that's the way it is that's what it takes to get
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.120]  humanity the next level I'm not even worried about that I'll be honest with
[42:34.120 --> 42:40.280]  you but they can't kill this congressman they can't kill them they can't kill an
[42:40.280 --> 42:47.600]  idea ideas are bulletproof to quote V and pretty soon when everybody just
[42:47.600 --> 42:50.880]  starts spouting off it's all we already hit critical mass you don't matter how
[42:50.880 --> 42:54.400]  many of us you kill you're gonna turn us into heroes like 300 which is true
[42:54.400 --> 43:00.680]  story what do you think killing me is going to save you no the reason you
[43:00.680 --> 43:04.680]  haven't killed me yet is because you know that and you know at a spiritual
[43:04.680 --> 43:12.720]  level I'm willing to go all the way because that's the only choice of course
[43:12.720 --> 43:16.920]  and it's the same thing for these congressmen and others you can see the
[43:16.920 --> 43:21.360]  look in this guy's eye of being a man I was just looking at a criminal who's
[43:21.360 --> 43:24.760]  committed all these crimes covered up Benghazi covered up Selindra covered up
[43:24.760 --> 43:28.320]  banking highs covered up MF global covered up every crime you could imagine
[43:28.320 --> 43:32.760]  and you know these politicians up there they're sick of getting the blame for
[43:32.760 --> 43:35.040]  everything and having a six percent approval rating they've got their
[43:35.040 --> 43:39.680]  constituents losing everything they don't want to be part of the evil they
[43:39.680 --> 43:43.920]  want to be good they want justice I'm telling you Louie Gomern I know him a
[43:43.920 --> 43:50.320]  good guy I know folks that know this other congressman Blake Ferenhold they
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.680]  say he's a real guy a real man a family man and at a certain point you can't get
[43:55.680 --> 44:00.000]  us all you understand that scum and then we're gonna wake up the sheeple that
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.120]  there's a real world going on out there we're going to Paul Watson a moment with
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.080]  huge breaking news on this new super bug that isn't that that that makes stuck
[44:08.080 --> 44:13.320]  snit look like a cakewalk and I believe is a cyber security false flag that I've
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.360]  been saying they're gonna watch but first off here is Holder blowing up at
[44:18.360 --> 44:23.120]  Gomert over threat of contempt here it is to provide you and your staff with
[44:23.120 --> 44:29.680]  sir I've read you which your department promised and it is inadequate and I
[44:29.680 --> 44:34.360]  realize that contempt is not a big deal to our Attorney General but it is
[44:34.360 --> 44:40.400]  important that we have proper oversight so you don't want to go there okay look
[44:40.400 --> 44:45.160]  at that thought I don't want to go there no about the contempt you should not
[44:45.160 --> 44:50.920]  assume that that is not a big deal to me I think that it was an appropriate I
[44:50.920 --> 44:54.920]  think it was unjust but never think that that was not a big deal to me don't
[44:54.920 --> 45:01.040]  use him well I'll do anything oh my god and we're known by our fruits and
[45:01.040 --> 45:05.080]  there have been no indications that it was a big deal because your department
[45:05.080 --> 45:09.160]  has still not been forthcoming in producing the documents that were the
[45:09.160 --> 45:13.600]  subject of the content you guys realize we're in a literal movie but it's not
[45:13.600 --> 45:17.760]  Captain America where it's fantasy we're in a movie with the equivalent of Hydra
[45:17.760 --> 45:23.280]  in control and of course they want to shut down the free society take out their
[45:23.280 --> 45:26.880]  opposition because then they think they got a thousand-year rule for them in
[45:26.880 --> 45:37.120]  their compadres literal megalomania now let's go to the essence of victory the
[45:37.120 --> 45:42.160]  black arrow the wind lands against smog if this spirit grows representative
[45:42.160 --> 45:47.320]  Blake find Fahrenheit saying you're a criminal because he is a criminal see
[45:47.320 --> 45:50.720]  when they commit mass criminal acts in the open if you don't end up
[45:50.720 --> 45:56.680]  prosecuting him or bare minimum making him resign it sets the precedent holder
[45:56.680 --> 45:59.440]  and all of them are a wedge when they get on TV and say your kids belong to us
[45:59.440 --> 46:02.760]  we're gonna take your guns it's meant to freak you out and get you ready for it
[46:02.760 --> 46:10.840]  it's meant to normalize it they're meant to get you ready he is the vanguard he
[46:10.840 --> 46:16.680]  is a shocktroop you either deal with him politically or they win they know
[46:16.680 --> 46:20.560]  what they're doing let's go to representative Blake Farron hold who I
[46:20.560 --> 46:23.880]  guarantee you they're gonna try to come after
[46:23.880 --> 46:31.480]  I committed to to maintaining the constitutional balance of power and the
[46:31.480 --> 46:36.840]  authority that this branch this legislative branch has and I just don't
[46:36.840 --> 46:42.840]  think it's appropriate and mr. Holder be here if an American citizen had not
[46:42.840 --> 46:47.040]  complied with one of the Justice Department subpoenas they would be in
[46:47.040 --> 46:51.080]  jail not sitting here in front of testifying but I realized their
[46:51.080 --> 46:55.960]  questions to be asked and I'll yield the remainder of my time to mr. Gowdy that
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.880]  congressman is scared when he says that and it should be holder has the power
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.120]  holder looked at Gomer point his finger at him and and and got away from the
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.240]  fake nice guy act and then and literally you can see Gomer and look at
[47:10.240 --> 47:14.920]  Gomer tough Gomer knows he's got a literal dragon demon sitting in front of
[47:14.920 --> 47:22.640]  him with untold blood of people on its hands who will do anything what do you
[47:22.640 --> 47:28.200]  do in the face of that you draw your sword you charge politically and when
[47:28.200 --> 47:32.360]  they set off a new Oklahoma City our people will be there this time and we'll
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.560]  have the video and we'll blow your operation like we did the Boston bombing
[47:36.560 --> 47:41.360]  fiasco and no amount of you know paramilitary guys you get dressed up in
[47:41.360 --> 47:44.240]  SWAT team outfits running around who don't even know what planet they're on
[47:44.240 --> 47:49.960]  is gonna shave your operation it's the thinkers in this world that count you
[47:49.960 --> 47:56.320]  need to understand that this is history happening so you're gonna see more and
[47:56.320 --> 47:59.800]  more of this folks and as things get worse and worse they cannot allow
[47:59.800 --> 48:04.000]  freedom on the internet they cannot allow free speech for their system to go
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.440]  through they have to exterminate the light they have to exterminate the
[48:07.440 --> 48:11.600]  liberty they have to exterminate the freedom because they can't exist in a
[48:11.600 --> 48:15.320]  world that has that that's why they're coming for you you think you're just
[48:15.320 --> 48:18.960]  gonna sit out of the game I'm gonna skip this network break you think you're
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.280]  going to sit out of the game you think you're just gonna sit on the sidelines
[48:23.280 --> 48:28.480]  that's the most dangerous place to be you want to be in the arena full charge
[48:28.480 --> 48:35.040]  100 and 10% going at it commit to it let the fear pass through you and you're
[48:35.040 --> 48:37.320]  done
[48:42.840 --> 48:51.280]  we're done we're committed you want to create an alamo in Nevada do it you want
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.840]  to create an alamo right here in Austin do it want to strike me down do it you
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.960]  want to set me up do it not scared understand I don't lose when you do it
[49:02.960 --> 49:09.360]  I win I'll be quite frank with you something kind of victory I want my
[49:09.360 --> 49:13.440]  flesh does not want it my spirit's willing though and my spirit runs my
[49:13.440 --> 49:19.280]  body it's in control and you can't have it you can't get at it it doesn't belong
[49:19.280 --> 49:27.360]  to you and I see you I know you and I will not stand here while you run a muck
[49:27.360 --> 49:32.960]  amongst the innocent the giant that is human liberty and compassion and
[49:32.960 --> 49:43.580]  creativity and honor is rising to meet the Leviathan threat of evil Sir Isaac
[49:43.580 --> 49:50.680]  Newton for every action there's an opposite an equal reaction or equal an
[49:50.680 --> 49:57.120]  opposite reaction you are that reaction you are what God formed you to be in
[49:57.120 --> 50:00.680]  your womb of your mother
[50:01.760 --> 50:09.400]  predestined if you took it in your hands the free will to become predestined
[50:09.400 --> 50:14.240]  that gift is already there if you take it in your hands or do you take the
[50:14.240 --> 50:19.760]  predestined will of your father the devil
[50:22.200 --> 50:25.840]  that's a big question
[50:27.680 --> 50:31.600]  holder tried to rise up and intimidate people but you can see the fear in his
[50:31.600 --> 50:42.040]  eyes the fear of knowing that there is no stopping liberty there is no stopping
[50:42.040 --> 50:49.960]  justice there is no stopping humanity's life force if we take the destiny God has
[50:49.960 --> 50:56.040]  offered us in free will and say we want to be good we want to be honorable we
[50:56.040 --> 51:03.280]  want to be loving we want to be strong we want to be true blue we want to be
[51:03.280 --> 51:11.240]  real we want a society based on productivity and truth not one on
[51:11.240 --> 51:17.960]  lies I'm going to Paul Watson but you talk about productivity and lies and
[51:17.960 --> 51:25.400]  we're gonna be getting into it coming up in the next hour with the farmer the
[51:25.400 --> 51:31.320]  rancher there's an article out today about record high beef prices the
[51:31.320 --> 51:34.720]  highest they've ever been and there's nothing in the article we'll put it up
[51:34.720 --> 51:41.240]  on screen about why record beef prices or why people aren't producing beef
[51:41.240 --> 51:45.040]  because they bought up and use the government to shut down all the small
[51:45.040 --> 51:52.920]  good meat packing facilities almost all of them LA Times reports they shut them
[51:52.920 --> 51:57.600]  down and only allow big agribusiness that radiates it and sprays liquid
[51:57.600 --> 52:03.800]  viruses on it to quote kill the bacteria you can look that up ABC news they set up
[52:03.800 --> 52:08.760]  a deal with the meat packers that there's not real cattle auctions anymore if
[52:08.760 --> 52:12.720]  they are they're very rare my family's been in the cattle business forever and
[52:12.720 --> 52:17.640]  people just got out of it I know major ranchers some of the biggest in Texas and
[52:17.640 --> 52:27.200]  they've sold their herds last year they got out of the business you know why
[52:27.200 --> 52:30.240]  they did because everything was actuaryed where you couldn't make a profit
[52:30.240 --> 52:39.840]  anymore but record gouging and prices for the people that's a rigged economy
[52:39.840 --> 52:43.520]  everything they did with taxes and regulations on the ranchers themselves
[52:43.520 --> 52:49.600]  and then on what they could sell they get record low when you sell the cow under
[52:49.600 --> 52:57.200]  record regulations and then the meat packers and the distributors give you
[52:57.200 --> 53:02.240]  the highest prices ever paid in this country we can't even produce enough beef
[53:02.240 --> 53:06.240]  for our country and import about a third of it now when we could supply the world
[53:06.240 --> 53:18.120]  with beef in 1957 we could supply the world with beef and now we can't supply
[53:18.120 --> 53:26.280]  half our country with it that's the bondage of the fraud Eric Holder style
[53:26.280 --> 53:35.760]  world the poverty of living under mafia trash and no one knows why because no
[53:35.760 --> 53:39.200]  one knows the technicals
[53:45.240 --> 53:48.400]  but don't worry the globalists have got special deals with Brazil to bring in
[53:48.400 --> 53:52.680]  the beef now and they'll waive the regulations that are on American
[53:52.680 --> 53:57.080]  producers see it's all shut up where you can't compete you can't survive roll
[53:57.080 --> 54:03.200]  over going welfare and die and if you try to run your cattle on public land
[54:03.200 --> 54:06.280]  that we've been doing for hundreds of years well here come 250 armed SWAT
[54:06.280 --> 54:09.800]  team members with drones and armored vehicles swearing they're going to kill
[54:09.800 --> 54:16.400]  you that's land of the free home of the brave Paul Watson joins us Paul I wanted
[54:16.400 --> 54:20.040]  to get you on to get your take on this but I know we've been saying they're
[54:20.040 --> 54:23.200]  going to launch a cybersecurity attack to get cybersecurity passed they've
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.640]  already put it in place general Alexander and Clapper Kurt Nemo wrote three
[54:27.640 --> 54:34.920]  years ago came out and both reported that oh in their own Pentagon briefings
[54:34.920 --> 54:38.600]  we'll launch false flag attacks to get this past came out in the BBC two weeks
[54:38.600 --> 54:41.160]  ago that the British government's been launching false flags to bring in
[54:41.160 --> 54:45.360]  internet control we know Stuxnet was launched by the US and Israel which they
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.080]  didn't use to try to pass cybersecurity an industrial virus an industrial
[54:49.080 --> 54:56.000]  reactor systems and other programs and now we have just something so mega massive
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.360]  I don't know what to say major bug called heart bleed exposes internet data
[55:00.360 --> 55:06.080]  almost every internet transaction system and the algorithm code used to
[55:06.080 --> 55:10.560]  encrypt it the keys to it which again the NSA developed all this or bought it
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.600]  now they're the main suspects because they stand again from it they're now
[55:14.600 --> 55:18.880]  releasing the keys they'll come out with a patch that's the new system that's
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.080]  their surveillance grid that's the prime projection you can it's speculation by
[55:23.080 --> 55:27.960]  me with all the dots but guaranteed that's it I mean I know that's it and
[55:27.960 --> 55:32.720]  my gut says it it's never been wrong you can see all the pieces right on time
[55:32.720 --> 55:38.040]  it's an attack on the internet itself heart bleed bug threatens web traffic
[55:38.040 --> 55:41.440]  financial times of London they say it's a threat to the internet itself heart
[55:41.440 --> 55:47.280]  bleed bug undoes web encryption reveals yahoo passwords this is a mega crisis in
[55:47.280 --> 55:52.960]  banking just unfolding massive security bug open SSL could affect a huge
[55:52.960 --> 55:56.120]  chunk of the internet it's already happening major governments like Canada
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.920]  are announcing their suspending online transactions in government in taxes I
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.720]  mean this is a mega crisis that I believe this is stage to get cyber
[56:04.720 --> 56:08.840]  security worldwide it's lined up to pass everywhere to end web freedom as we
[56:08.840 --> 56:14.800]  know it to bring in total surveillance the patch will be the new mega jack into
[56:14.800 --> 56:18.760]  all systems because if you have the encryption that's used system-wide you
[56:18.760 --> 56:22.760]  have the internet Paul Watson do you agree without analysis can we get writers to
[56:22.760 --> 56:28.280]  do a prime projection report well what I find amazing about it Alex is the fact
[56:28.280 --> 56:32.360]  that this has been going on for two years and they've only just announced it
[56:32.360 --> 56:38.200]  it's a vulnerability in the open SSL system which is where you put in a past
[56:38.200 --> 56:42.120]  but they've now published how to do it is the point the keys have now been leaked
[56:42.120 --> 56:46.600]  yeah they were they were leaked two days ago when people were doing it and yahoo
[56:46.600 --> 56:51.200]  mail is being completely compromised they're talking about at least 500,000
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.720]  major websites the encryption keys have been totally exposed it's the system
[56:55.720 --> 56:59.760]  where you put in your password one server sends it to another server those
[56:59.760 --> 57:04.760]  encryption keys that are supposedly protecting that information have been
[57:04.760 --> 57:10.880]  exposed and vulnerable for two years so this is they're calling it an 11 out of
[57:10.880 --> 57:16.840]  10 on the scale of internet crises so they're announcing it so hackers will
[57:16.840 --> 57:24.680]  then copycat and exploit it to create a organic triggered false flag kind of
[57:24.680 --> 57:29.620]  like Arab Spring go ahead yeah well they're only patching up the
[57:29.620 --> 57:33.760]  vulnerabilities now so there is still a ton of websites open to this which is
[57:33.760 --> 57:38.200]  why the experts are now telling everybody to change all their passwords
[57:38.200 --> 57:43.120]  immediately and even that might not help because those password changes could
[57:43.120 --> 57:48.640]  then be intercepted as well so the the projection that it could be some kind of
[57:48.640 --> 57:53.160]  NSA false flag I mean I would imagine they were in on it from the start from
[57:53.160 --> 57:57.920]  two years ago and we know that Greenwald recently said there are major revelations
[57:57.920 --> 58:01.120]  coming up from the Snowden documents bigger than anything we've seen before
[58:01.120 --> 58:05.600]  so I wonder if it's related to this in any way but well the way to write the
[58:05.600 --> 58:10.800]  articles is you have them launching all these false flags before and now they're
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.200]  trying to pass cyber security again it's perfect timing what is your gut tell
[58:15.200 --> 58:21.960]  you Watson well I don't need my gosh look at the past four years Stuxnet in 2010
[58:21.960 --> 58:27.520]  where you predicted on September 27 2010 that it was a false flag US in Israel
[58:27.520 --> 58:32.800]  for months afterwards we were called conspiracy theorists and then a few
[58:32.800 --> 58:36.440]  months later it was admitted that yes it was launched by the US have a guess
[58:36.440 --> 58:45.240]  Microsoft launched this stay there thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live

[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:23.120]  alex jones
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:30.200]  we've got the rancher at the center of a huge international crisis now is hundreds
[1:00:30.200 --> 1:00:36.360]  of feds arrived with weapons out in Nevada joining us coming up but Paul
[1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:39.320]  Watson you know I don't chewed our horn that it came out the London telegraph
[1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:44.840]  that the Assad regime reads the info wars and uses our analysis at their
[1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:48.640]  highest levels of their intelligence so that the Russians did and it's not that
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:52.400]  they're looking at us as propaganda they're looking at us for analysis it
[1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:58.720]  comes out that you know stratford is attacking us covertly in their emails and
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:02.240]  then you demonizing us and and and trying to run programs that discredit us
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:07.720]  feeding that info to the CIA we see ourselves on the White House enemies
[1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:13.240]  list we see ourselves being attacked by MSNBC CNN Nightline I mean the list goes
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:16.760]  on and on the fact is we really know what we're talking about and I don't
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:21.240]  chewed my horn I forgot that I came out when Stuxnet came out and no one knew
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.400]  where it was they're trying to blame Russia or somebody and I said it's gonna
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:27.840]  be the US and Israel against Iran's nuclear program it's not a hard guess
[1:01:27.840 --> 1:01:32.240]  because they were given access to Microsoft Colonel which only Microsoft
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:36.840]  has and is a super secret well Microsoft is above government in the eugenics
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:43.280]  platform IBM front under the aegis of Thomas Watson and his eugenics program
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:48.160]  and he gave his whole wealth to that program so for antitrust they opened
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:52.680]  up Microsoft as their front most people don't know that but the whole point is
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:02:00.480]  is that is that this is a very serious situation and now they're gonna push for
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:04.580]  web censorship web taxing web control the name of protecting it you got three
[1:02:04.580 --> 1:02:07.680]  minutes thanks for popping in we need to get on this Paul what else do you have
[1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:14.320]  to say on the subject well back in 2010 2011 when Stuxnet first arose they
[1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:18.480]  cited that as a reason to control the internet even though China was doing
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:22.360]  almost exactly the same thing at the same time you remember Lieberman appeared
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:27.080]  on CNN and cited Stuxnet as a reason that they need to control the internet
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:30.320]  they need to regulate and I correctly said it was the US and Israel and
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:36.200]  Microsoft go ahead you said that on September 27 2010 and we still got the
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:41.840]  video in the original article then the economist CNN and many others came out
[1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.160]  and said that basically anyone who believes that the US and Israel is
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:49.760]  behind Stuxnet is a conspiracy theory so I've got the quotes in the article
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:55.160]  Stuxnet another conspiracy theory that turned out to be true and if you remember
[1:02:55.160 --> 1:02:59.480]  that was actually a virus designed to make it appear as if nuclear power
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:03.640]  stations were running normally when in fact and the quote here is from a
[1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:08.680]  security expert behind the scenes they were heading for destruction so the
[1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:13.000]  most dangerous thing you could do and now this Stuxnet is still infecting
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:17.200]  Russian nuclear power plants the most dangerous thing you could do they
[1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:22.360]  created this virus blamed it on Russia and China then tried to use it to sense
[1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:26.760]  of the internet while it threatens nuclear meltdowns at plants around the
[1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:31.120]  world this is how insanely out of control they are and people ask who's
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:34.640]  side are we on I'm on the side of not having nuclear plants go down have war
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:39.520]  with Russia I'm on the side of peace and I'm sick of these crazy agents of chaos
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:45.960]  order out of chaos that are running our society Paul it just boggles the mind
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:51.600]  that they would engage in such activity but I mean this this heart bleeds
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:55.120]  being going on for two years they're talking about having access to everybody's
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:04:00.240]  email password this is gonna have the NSA's fingerprints all over it you can
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:04.680]  bet your bottom dollar on that because you know that's what we've we've seen
[1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:09.960]  before with the the technology that's been revealed recently being computers
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:13.440]  from a distance and lift the data from them so the truth is the globalist
[1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:17.480]  aren't that smart it's easy to be evil and wreck stuff and they do it and say
[1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:22.320]  their geniuses and the problem is with the good people let these nut cases do
[1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:26.360]  this Paul Watson get on it special reports I want the whole crew on it

[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:32.840]  ladies and gentlemen there is a major situation brewing we've been covering
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:36.320]  in the last week and a half drugreport.com I was the first to start
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:40.320]  carrying our articles now corporate state-run media has been also now
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:47.000]  jumping on board Nevada governor blast feds first amendment area in Bundy
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:52.160]  dispute and I've studied this because my family is in ranching and in the late
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:56.120]  great dairy brownfield here on the network who is a famous cattleman and
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:00.560]  talk show host had all his problems in Missouri and the rest of the country
[1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:05.360]  covering what would happen with state and federal land where some areas 80 plus
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:09.080]  percent of the land is federal and they're shutting down the roads that
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:12.560]  have been there for hundreds of years in some cases they're cutting off access
[1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:16.200]  to water over sucker fish that aren't even indigenous and climate falls
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:25.360]  Oregon and the northern California bottom line there's a war on ranchers and
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:29.960]  on farmers we've seen famous cases in Minnesota where there's five generation
[1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:36.720]  families that have a few hundred acres and then state and federal parks encroach
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:41.560]  grab the land around them and then one day they just put padlocks on the gate
[1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:45.720]  only into your property and then next they kick you off and the Rangers move
[1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:49.280]  into your house that happened right across the Golden Gate Bridge the
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:52.360]  thousands of acres that was owned by private groups in neighborhoods they
[1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:56.560]  kicked the folks out and they made it a recreation area for the private federal
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:02.760]  workers I was out in Big Bend and saw a huge area that's just for them so this
[1:10:02.760 --> 1:10:07.080]  is basically the servants power grabbing and they under agenda 21 which is a UN
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:12.040]  treaty they want people off the land over 90% of Nevada is federal and state
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:18.960]  property last time I checked 7 to 8% roughly is privately owned now can the
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:24.760]  citizens have 8% now they have open grazers they made the movie open range
[1:10:24.760 --> 1:10:28.360]  it was a composite of range war real events that happened like that movies
[1:10:28.360 --> 1:10:32.120]  actually based on true events they just changed the names just like the
[1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:37.320]  Patriots based on three true people composited with Mel Gibson this is a big
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:44.240]  deal and in the past in the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s big corporations would come in
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:47.080]  I'm just giving you an update before we go to the gentlemen standing up for all
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:52.120]  our property rights they would come in with Pinkerton security Rockefeller
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:57.280]  security famous cases in Colorado that kill whole towns of people we're bringing
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:01.280]  in paramilitary soldiers burning towns down burning out farmhouses this has
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:04.680]  been done before and people would arm up and they would go and literally have
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:10.400]  firefights from Tennessee to Colorado from Texas to Wyoming from Utah to
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:16.160]  California from Vermont to Florida this has been going on basically boss hog
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:22.520]  comes in with the feds and takes over now Cliven Bundy his family's been there
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:28.560]  since the 1870s back before it was even a territory and then a state they've been
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:33.360]  running their cattle there off their land on to the BLM and they're claiming oh
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:37.080]  we have a tortoise like the cave bug or the Golden Sheik Warbler they've been
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:40.840]  caught planting them in other areas they've been caught planting you know
[1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:46.440]  Puma's in areas from Florida and Colorado you know about that this is their excuse
[1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:49.920]  and let me tell you the average park rangers nice when you get in these BLM
[1:11:49.920 --> 1:11:55.000]  these armed people they are rude they are mean I've run into them and you'll
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.600]  say hi to him walking out of a park bathroom and those just growl at you
[1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:02.480]  and that's because they want them to be imperious now here's the headlines and
[1:12:02.480 --> 1:12:06.920]  we're going to our guest about 40 after he's a very busy man he's got 300 head
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:09.360]  of his cattle that have already been stolen he didn't know they're alive
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:12.200]  a lot of times the BLM just locks them up lets them die
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:18.120]  Nevada governor blast feds first amendment in Bundy says the constitutional
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:22.080]  rights is sacred to Nevadans and Nevadans are massing so now the 250

[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:03.360]  you the floor of why you're making this stand the mainstream media spends it
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:07.800]  like this old guy claims why he has a natural right to this well yeah under
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:11.120]  common law of the Constitution you've been there before it was a state you've
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.680]  had continual use possessions nine tenths of the law it's called open range
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:21.880]  explain it to him sir thank you for inviting me on your show today it is a
[1:13:21.880 --> 1:13:26.640]  privilege to talk to America you know the first thing I want to explain to
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:33.320]  America I I do live in America I live in the sovereign state of Nevada and that's
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:38.920]  right and you know what so in other words I live within a state with the
[1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:43.480]  borders around it and then I also live in the Clark County, Nevada which has
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:48.920]  also borders around it we we the people do have sovereignty here at least that's
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:52.560]  what I thought when I was growing up but through the years I thought we would
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:57.320]  have our sovereignty right now what it looks like is that we have a central
[1:13:57.320 --> 1:14:02.320]  government with unlimited power and they've taken over our state sovereignty
[1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:06.560]  they've taken over our state laws they've taken over the access to our
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:14.000]  public land and they have taken over our sheriff's policing power very well said
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:20.800]  very well said continue you know to just to bring you up today a little bit of
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:26.920]  what we're up against but it was about three weeks the BLM has been
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:34.360]  dispatching compounds making like an army camp bringing in all their
[1:14:34.360 --> 1:14:39.040]  communication their vehicles their equipment they also have hired a
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:44.080]  contract cowboy with helicopters and trucks and trailers and panels and hay
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:50.160]  and water and all of those things to service their horses so they could go
[1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:55.120]  out and these are what we call contract cowboys that contract cowboy is an ugly
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:15:01.360]  word in the West it's not so but anyway that so now what we've got we've got a
[1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:06.280]  lock up lock out this situation on the public land of the Clark County, Nevada
[1:15:06.280 --> 1:15:13.600]  we've got a lock up a situation on Bundy Ranch that surrounded me with you know
[1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:21.280]  many vehicles and armed men and top surveillance and they even have snipers
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:27.760]  placed around the area and so we're you know we're in a lock-up type situation
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:34.400]  my cattle and they raise and they range on a large area here it's the desert
[1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:40.600]  Southwest desert large area the cattle run similar to what a deer would run or
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:45.880]  elk on the wild their habitat is the same I've been locked away from these
[1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:49.160]  cattle for about three weeks to where I haven't been able to check to see if they're
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:55.840]  having trouble with calving the calving season right now the waters on this
[1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:59.320]  desert very important I have to do a lot of maintenance and making sure they have
[1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:04.960]  water I've been able to do that and now the last few days I've seen the
[1:16:04.960 --> 1:16:11.000]  helicopters running the cowboys trucks with large convoys of government
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:17.080]  vehicles and they moving around my ranch around my cattle they run
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:22.600]  approximately 300 head into trails and they're holding them and so right now
[1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:26.160]  that's our challenge how we're gonna get these cattle out of the trail and get
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:29.960]  them back on I understand sir and I want to get into all that with you but for
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:34.920]  those that don't understand public land and the fact that out in your state it's
[1:16:34.920 --> 1:16:40.080]  it's it's over 80 plus but he was what's the latest numbers on how much land in
[1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:45.080]  Nevada's federal yeah I picked up approximately 90% but when you say
[1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:49.640]  federal you know I don't agree with that I call this Nevada state land how in
[1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:53.960]  the Constitution how in this world could the federal government claim Mr. Bundy I
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:58.760]  agree with you and all over the country in areas where they've got 70 80 90% in
[1:16:58.760 --> 1:17:02.360]  different states they're grabbing up everything I know I agree with you you
[1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:06.800]  were there before it's your ranch they showed up and declared it theirs but you
[1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:10.040]  still had grazing rights and now I guess they're gonna claim your house and
[1:17:10.040 --> 1:17:14.960]  everything belongs to them explain that to people okay what I want to explain
[1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:22.480]  to you right when we talk about rights on public land yes sir explain it to us
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:27.080]  because you're the expert I do not own all of the rights to these public lands
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:32.840]  I own only own part of those rights I'll go through the rights I own I own the
[1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:39.320]  forage I own the water I own I own access rights and I own range improvement
[1:17:39.320 --> 1:17:45.520]  and then I own all of the rights that we the people of the public things like
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:50.840]  being able to go patient hunting camp and sightseeing those type of rights I
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:56.800]  retain those rights now let me explain to you how I get rights for say grazing
[1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:01.160]  we have never run my cattle out on this open range a bright that you don't have
[1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:06.560]  as a public those rights were created through beneficial use that's right what
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:12.520]  what beneficial use was is back in my eight night 1877 when my forefathers
[1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:18.240]  and others come to this land you know when they come in here on with a team of
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:25.800]  horses and pull of the wagon and if them when they had a hook up that harness
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:30.880]  buckle and took that horse away from that wagon the first thing that horse
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:35.360]  needed was a drink of water so they took him over here to the spring or the
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:40.800]  creek and they give that horse a drink of water as the first step that that horse
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:47.120]  took created what started to create a right through beneficial use that horse
[1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:52.120]  started to create right on the land and by the way this isn't some legal theory
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:56.240]  you're putting out this goes back to Leviticus British common law US common
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:00.000]  law state law what you're saying is absolutely true that's where water
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:04.200]  rights stake in your claim if you were the first guy to go find the gold vein
[1:19:04.200 --> 1:19:09.040]  on on land that you know wasn't claimed it was yours and that's that's what
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:13.360]  Nevada state law is based on is those first pre-empty rights those rights it
[1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:17.800]  was created and course now then those that right where that horse fit that
[1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:22.520]  water he started to create that right and that right now is registered with the
[1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:27.920]  state of Nevada water law and that is a valid and I want to tell everybody
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:32.640]  something it's real property and and so now the next thing that our state
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:36.080]  didn't need something to eat well they didn't have a bale of air back a
[1:19:36.080 --> 1:19:40.360]  gradient back the way and they took him up the wash here and started to feed him
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:48.000]  a piece of grass or a bite off of a brooch a brush and that started to
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.120]  create yes sir beneficial use of the forest mr. bunny we got a break this is

[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:03.160]  knives well England's actually calling for licenses to have knives I'm not
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:10.360]  joking butcher knives but sir it's established state law common law you've
[1:25:10.360 --> 1:25:14.160]  been using that land since your great-great-granddaddy I who wasn't
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:18.640]  your great-great-great-granddaddy that came in and then I started using the
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:22.320]  land there and I get in the water rights and service rights and forage rights in
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:29.320]  1877 yes it was my you know great-great-great back there for five or
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:33.440]  six generations ago and what they started established these rights by
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:38.200]  beneficial use of the water and the forage and the access rights were they
[1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:42.760]  had to build all of their own trails and roads in them days and and from that
[1:25:42.760 --> 1:25:49.360]  time to this point in time it's been continuously used I say my rights are
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.320]  either of inherited my rights or a proper right you got to remember that back
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:59.320]  in those days there's a lot of other there was more of a pioneer settlers here
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:04.400]  than just my grandfather and they was creating rights also and over the years
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:10.560]  those rights of any they're created or bought and now look down to me and so I'll
[1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:13.560]  be there inherited my rights or a bottle
[1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:17.520]  I shifting gears out of that we've settled that the media says you claim
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:20.760]  you've got a right because you were there first counting on the ignorance of
[1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:26.720]  the public hundreds of our men's snipers get into that I saw in the news 200
[1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:30.600]  foot poles with surveillance cameras helicopters they've got to be spending
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:34.880]  millions of dollars they've already grabbed 300 of your head of cattle you're
[1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:39.200]  not allowed to see them I mean describe the police state and what's going on
[1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:42.240]  there and I'd imagine a lot of these cowboys and people would probably like
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:47.960]  to have a little word or two with these mercenaries you know you thought that
[1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:52.720]  subject sort of sad to think that your fellow cowboys would be here stealing
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:26:57.320]  your cattle and and I can't really call them my fellow cowboys but they're they're
[1:26:57.320 --> 1:27:05.920]  got the name of a contract cowboys which is a dirty name in the west talking to
[1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:11.400]  them what's going on here but we just go back to three weeks ago when we see
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:19.320]  that the BLM and the government people stage in their pounds they brought you
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:23.520]  know lots of the equipment in here and their stage in there you know approximately
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:28.760]  200 armed men here and they're armed did not was inside arms they're armed with
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:37.440]  heavy military type weapons sniper equipment and of course all the spy and
[1:27:37.440 --> 1:27:43.000]  high-powered cameras and surveillance equipment and those that's the
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:49.360]  equipment's been set up around my home farm and also while we're staging a
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.560]  protest area that's all that stuff we're in other words we're being surveyed and
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:28:00.320]  probably listen to all 24 hours a day here well sure with the NSA you can
[1:28:00.320 --> 1:28:03.840]  guarantee they're illegally listening to you right now what do you want to say on
[1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:07.880]  air sir to the people that are spending millions of dollars to steal your
[1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:12.160]  cattle and destroy everybody's grazing rights nationwide you know they're
[1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:15.440]  trying to set a precedent with you just one man standing what do you want to say
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:20.280]  to the establishment well I'd like to talk to them the public just a little bit
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:26.640]  you know if this is your government act in this way and I'm I'm a producer I did
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:34.920]  I actually convert this desert into a edible commodity for you to eat and so I
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:39.880]  feel like that I'm a valid range here I'm a producer for American people now
[1:28:39.880 --> 1:28:45.800]  that about he's talking about this nearest Terry's type type I don't know
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:52.120]  what you call it invasion government with unlimited power a central government
[1:28:52.120 --> 1:28:56.320]  unlimited power I have a hard time believing this is happening in the
[1:28:56.320 --> 1:29:01.400]  United States now these people that are doing this I'm saying the America is
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:05.800]  not going to stand for this we're going to stand for our Constitution we're
[1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:11.560]  going to stand for our state rights and our local policing power those three
[1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:15.780]  things we will stand and we'll stay here after all the cows are gone and
[1:29:15.780 --> 1:29:20.160]  we're still going to stand America will not give up those freedoms and liberties
[1:29:20.160 --> 1:29:25.680]  that we fought so hard for for the last almost 400 years we've fought for this

[1:31:05.400 --> 1:31:09.000]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:13.080]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:17.360]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:21.240]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:36.480]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to

[1:33:11.880 --> 1:33:18.440]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're
[1:33:18.440 --> 1:33:28.960]  listening to Alex Jones I tell you whenever you talk to one of these
[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:37.120]  ranchers from Missouri or Nevada or Texas or it could even be in Minnesota
[1:33:37.120 --> 1:33:42.160]  these old guys that just work on the land every day and work from Dustle
[1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:46.640]  Dawn and their families they're just so straight shooters good people it actually
[1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:51.280]  makes me really sad because both my grandfathers were just like this guy in
[1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:58.920]  fact my mom's dad look looks just like this guy and it makes me angry because
[1:33:58.920 --> 1:34:02.440]  this country used to be so free compared to this and we are just being overrun by
[1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:08.360]  the feds themselves under UNESCO and the UN and the agenda 21 Treaty and Bill
[1:34:08.360 --> 1:34:13.120]  Clinton's executive order they already took millions of acres was almost 2
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:20.080]  million in 1997 Clinton laid them off use in Utah and it had been public land
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:23.360]  people had grazing rights on they just stole them even though the law said they
[1:34:23.360 --> 1:34:29.800]  couldn't some families they're longer than mr. Bundy and it turned out it had
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:33.840]  the only clean burning coal in North America in it that could pass the EPA
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:38.080]  rules had no mercury in it now it turned out China was had the only other
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:44.000]  reserves in the world and so their their coal doubled in value literally in one
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:47.920]  month and it turned out Bill Clinton was invested in it so there's all sorts of
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:53.480]  scams going on here but I already showed the article out of the LA Times where
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:57.600]  we don't know why it's the highest beast price is everywhere I guess it's the
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:03.840]  drought and ranchers getting out of it no my family after ranching in Texas since
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:08.480]  1829 is basically getting out of it still got a couple hundred head but that's you
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:12.800]  should have thousands I'm not gonna say names of some of my friends but folks
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:15.840]  you've heard them on the air some really good well-known big ranchers I'm
[1:35:15.840 --> 1:35:19.640]  talking tens of thousands of heads of black Angus they sold their herd last
[1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:25.600]  year selling their 12,000 acre ranch they're done you cannot make money in it
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.880]  and the government harasses you and that's why beef prices are off the
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:34.480]  charts and the big meatpackers run scams now there's no real auctions anymore I
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:39.200]  know mr. Bundy could talk about that I'm ranting it just frustrates me to come
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:46.520]  from a long farming ranching heritage and to see it absolutely being destroyed
[1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:51.040]  we could supply the world in the late 1950s with beef we can't even supply
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:56.440]  ourselves now we are cursed with filthy government we're becoming poor because
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:01.320]  of the globalist and their program of agenda 21 not because we just can't
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:06.040]  produce anymore now I'm ranting mr. Bundy talk about the forces their
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:08.760]  massings and they've moved back into their military camps how many more
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:11.680]  head of cattle do you have where do you expect this to go you told me the
[1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:18.600]  militias there what's happening you've got the floor well one thing that's
[1:36:18.600 --> 1:36:25.320]  happening they have a rounded up just told them 300 of my cattle they've got
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:30.760]  them in a compound they're on the ranch yet only they need to be open the gate
[1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:35.480]  needs to be open up but that those cattle go back their natural habitat and
[1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:42.640]  those cattle would be out there raising use some more beef but what's happening
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:47.760]  here is that the forces actually kept me from operating and taking care of my
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:53.600]  cattle and and of course they have used great force to express expressed here
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:37:02.600]  together these cattle let me explain a little bit about where we are politically
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:05.160]  I guess
[1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:13.520]  okay hang up there yes sir go ahead and get into that I know you've been doing a
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:16.720]  lot of interviews and are tired yeah that's all right I've got interruptions
[1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:26.080]  here okay excuse me but I want to want you to understand that we're fighting a
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:32.040]  government here with unlimited power and I you know we talk about ownership and
[1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:37.760]  property and try to lay out the fact that I do live in a state we do this is
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:43.480]  sovereign state of Nevada with this is the property of Clark County the people
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:47.960]  we the people of Clark County Nevada on this land and then we're fighting against
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:53.400]  this government that's making a show to the United States people that they have
[1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:59.280]  this power to basically take over our state or state law and you know even our
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:07.800]  sheriff power and so we're standing here with a question in our mind who is
[1:38:07.800 --> 1:38:13.840]  going to have this power when it's when we're done with it you know that that was
[1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:17.640]  taught us something that the people of the Revolutionary War fought when we
[1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:23.400]  seem to be like but we're in the same position as those people were how are
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:29.200]  we going to get our liberties back we've been here in this country for 200 years
[1:38:29.200 --> 1:38:34.960]  from our broken father fathers to our Patriot fathers and we still don't have
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:40.200]  our freedoms and liberty and so we fight the strongest government in the
[1:38:40.200 --> 1:38:46.120]  world the British Army they had to and and guess what we did we won and then
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:54.080]  we created our states and a Constitution and Nevada come under a
[1:38:54.080 --> 1:38:59.200]  statehood and equal footing we do have our liberty and freedoms caught to our
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:04.360]  Constitution but here on this land we've lost them at this time right now so
[1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:11.440]  we've got a battle to gain the gainer Constitution liberties back so your
[1:39:11.440 --> 1:39:14.560]  bottom line Mike Paul Revere you're making your stand you're telling folks
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:19.000]  we're being overrun by an out of control tyranny UN run it literally is in the
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:23.440]  treaties folks and they want this land they want the precedent for receivership
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:27.560]  for the national debt to kick people off their own land or to kick them off the
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:31.960]  land they have surface rights and forage rights and water rights to and if
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:38.280]  they can do this to mr. Bundy they can do it to anybody now you have seen a lot
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:43.320]  of support what do you make of the governor beginning to tepidly but but
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:47.520]  at least he's doing it criticize the feds I mean I think the governor ought to
[1:39:47.520 --> 1:39:52.800]  call out the state police and point out the state law and common law and they
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:56.000]  ought to start arresting people for stealing those cattle well they should
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:02.040]  by state law and they definitely should be doing this and the governor should be
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:07.080]  the leader this he should say this will not happen in the state of Nevada and we
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:12.760]  and I'd want to stress this point I rancid by all of the laws of the state
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:18.840]  of Nevada I ain't rancid by the United States federal codes very little in
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:25.040]  other words I disobey and give no jurisdiction authority to the federal
[1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:30.680]  government but I give honor and pledge to all of those laws of the state of
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:35.120]  Nevada now our governor is a leader this he should be the one that's fighting
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.440]  this battle not me he should be the one that's saying they these cattle are
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:43.960]  stolen cattle this is a valid right to open the gates and get these cattle
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:49.920]  back home well bottom line I've looked at the law I know the laws they are
[1:40:49.920 --> 1:40:55.600]  violating the laws and what do you think of the 250 armed troops militarized
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:05.720]  aircraft surveillance polls surveilling your house I mean it's an army for one
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:13.400]  rancher it just shows how disconnected this government is well it shows how
[1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:19.480]  disconnected this government is but how disconnected we the people are how
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:25.800]  would we ever believe this could happen to a rancher individual family range I
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:30.920]  mean why would they show this kind of force it's always a hard question but
[1:41:30.920 --> 1:41:35.680]  I'll tell you we feel danger we feel our liberties and freedoms are gone we feel
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:43.840]  access to our lands gone besides feeling that they still their cattle it's just
[1:41:43.840 --> 1:41:49.480]  really quite confusing so why this government would do what they're doing
[1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:55.760]  but let me tell you why you know what I tell them when they come and try to put
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:41:59.760]  force and they you know they want to know what I'll do and what I say I'll
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:04.640]  do I said I'll do whatever it takes and they want to know what that means well
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:10.160]  I will do whatever it takes to to preserve our rights and liberties and our
[1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:17.040]  statehood and so because I make that statement they seem to say well this
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:21.760]  man he can't stand we're going out to taking down and so they're putting that
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:26.920]  much pressure on me and my family and my property that they could actually show
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:32.120]  America that they have a strength enough to take this last man down and that's
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:36.800]  where they're at well that's right and we've seen thousands of people hundreds
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:40.480]  of times showing up to support you and I think you know they know they're gonna
[1:42:40.480 --> 1:42:44.480]  have a major propaganda defeat if they do set you up or do something no one's
[1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:49.640]  gonna buy it if they plant drugs on you whatever but the sky is the limit with
[1:42:49.640 --> 1:42:55.680]  these criminals specifically let's get into the mainstream media we've heard
[1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:58.480]  where they're implying you're saying you're gonna be violent or whatever if
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:03.600]  in which you haven't really said if they're going after your property what's
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:07.000]  the line in the sand I mean they've already stolen 300 of the cattle and now
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:11.520]  they've got snipers aiming at the peaceful crowds they arrested people for
[1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:14.720]  those that don't know well the governor spoken out who just stood there on the
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:19.080]  side of the road with their signs the feds the BLM says that's not allowed
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:23.160]  in America either they're not just trampling property rights and land use
[1:43:23.160 --> 1:43:28.120]  rights they're now trampling the First Amendment as well but yes you know I've
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:36.080]  had two kids two of my children hassled and now and one of them arrested and
[1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:42.600]  abused and then after two days or you know they turning loose on the streets
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:48.760]  of Las Vegas without you know even charging within your serious at all
[1:43:48.760 --> 1:43:53.640]  in other words they they're abusive and you know that's something that we're
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:58.160]  having a hard time with describe what happened there yeah were they just kidnaped
[1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:06.120]  one of your sons well he was along the road side of the state highway and they
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:11.480]  took a surrounded him he was actually taking pictures on the right way of the
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:18.080]  state highway they surrounded him with a with vehicles and armed people took him
[1:44:18.080 --> 1:44:24.200]  the ground down stood on his head stood on his neck grounded his ground his head
[1:44:24.200 --> 1:44:29.680]  into the rocks and gravel and then they put the handcuffs on him and just tied
[1:44:29.680 --> 1:44:35.920]  as they could I'm using food in the car he's said in a in a tricycle truck I
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:40.680]  don't know how I mean opener how it was for like four hours over in the same
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:44.920]  compound where they got the cattle and then they transferred him to Henderson
[1:44:44.920 --> 1:44:50.200]  Nevada put him in the jail out there go and stay there overnight the next day
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:57.360]  they transported him to the court of the United States courthouse in Las Vegas
[1:44:57.360 --> 1:45:02.840]  and it was real rough and abusive and the his expression to me and the media he
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:09.040]  said I really thought he's gonna hang me kill me he said I felt like my life was
[1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:14.800]  over that's how rough this treatment and he said but all of a sudden he said
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:21.320]  things changed he said they lose my shackles when he got me in a sack lunch
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:25.800]  and they kicked me out on the streets of Las Vegas well yeah no they'd like under
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:29.760]  NDA to just disappear him and I'm not just saying that as rhetoric that's
[1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:32.880]  where this is going and all the Homeland Security training is gun owners
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:39.960]  veterans property rights activists libertarians conservatives Christians I
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:44.400]  mean you read what they're training for and they literally think asking questions
[1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:49.400]  or videotaping is criminal and they would love to just drag us all off and
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.120]  throw us in dungeons now when they knew when it backfired they kidnapped your
[1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:57.840]  son they had no standing that they you know let him back out but I know they've
[1:45:57.840 --> 1:46:01.880]  arrested others as well for demonstrating and the governor's now spoken out I
[1:46:01.880 --> 1:46:06.360]  just don't get how these feds think they're God and are such shameful
[1:46:06.360 --> 1:46:11.000]  dishonorable evil people let's talk about the governor you brought that up a
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:16.160]  minute ago the governor didn't make a stand and what this we've got to
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:20.920]  understand what he's talking about here you remember the United States now has
[1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:27.000]  unlimited power they've taken over all the even the area and they've even taken
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:31.200]  along the you know interstate highways you know between the highway and the
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:36.040]  French team have taken over those areas and then stage two places where they
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:41.960]  could said we could exercise our first amendment rights and so there's a little
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:49.200]  pinstall orange trail I call it a pig pen they've got two of those and right
[1:46:49.200 --> 1:46:52.240]  in that in that picture imagine out the middle of the desert on state highways
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:55.760]  they're telling citizens they can't use it or haven't the only haven't these
[1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:00.120]  little these little FEMA camps these little micro prisons where where where
[1:47:00.120 --> 1:47:03.560]  they can stand around with guns trained on you yeah and you can you can get
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:08.640]  inside of those and you can exercise or create their first amendment rights and
[1:47:08.640 --> 1:47:15.680]  anything else part county area it is off bounds and if you get it if you try to
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:20.280]  exercise it right there then they treat you like my son I had a daughter they
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:24.320]  treated almost the same way only they didn't take her to jail and so that's
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:30.320]  that's how much freedom we have there now our governor and I you know bless his
[1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:37.640]  heart he did have a mouth-gum chin to say me Ellen would you please take down
[1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:44.200]  these signs on these and these these pig pens I put it that way and this morning
[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:47.920]  I did make a circle the signs are off one of them and but the other in the
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:53.080]  signs are still up so no it's a criminal group on state highways erecting
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:57.160]  things telling you it'd be like saying you have free speech it exists at the
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:01.120]  bottom of the Mariana's trench or or you have a first amendment it exists on
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:04.880]  Pluto but you can't get there this is a sick joke it's been overthrown in court
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:09.200]  and it literally shows that they want to shut down our first amendment I mean
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:13.600]  this is outrageous what do these BLM people think is going to happen to their
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:18.880]  future when there's no checks and balances they are insane yeah that's
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:23.640]  where the way they're active I mean if you use to use here today interview me
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:27.960]  we'd have to be inside that big pen around that fence in the back of that
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:33.360]  first amendment area signed in order for us to be legal so if I try to walk up
[1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:36.360]  and down the road or walk up to their camp and talk to them they probably
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  punch me in the nose no parking no access closed lock gates 45 vehicles
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:52.280]  stopping you from going back to you know what else the BLM's doing all over the
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:55.520]  country and land they've grabbed criminally as pirates you know they're
[1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:58.440]  they're blocking the roads with rocks they're blocking roads that have been
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:02.280]  used for hundreds of years has that been going on in your area yes it has and
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:07.520]  they've got they've got designated routes and road closure signs all over this
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.560]  area I've brought against that for years I've brought against the backcountry by
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:15.280]  ways because what they were doing on the backcountry by ways and that's what
[1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:19.880]  they want to do here also they'll tell the public we're not closing off the
[1:49:19.880 --> 1:49:24.080]  access we're actually giving you a backcountry by way but we're talking
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:29.640]  about six hundred thousand acres of public land here and it created a
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:37.600]  backcountry by way of 51 miles I believe it is sort of a tear-shaped circle so
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:44.440]  they will give you the access to 51 miles of this your public land but here's
[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:49.760]  the restrictions it's like a sidewalk you stay on the sidewalk and if you
[1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:54.320]  get off on the grass you're gonna get a $500 fight now that's right it's a
[1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:58.760]  criminal government telling us our public land we can't use it first they
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:01.960]  shouldn't have control of it anyways it should be given to the state should be
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:11.040]  sold it should be it should be sold and it should be public land we still
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:15.840]  call it public land but it belongs to we the people of Clark County and and you
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:19.800]  know I only have right there is the public should be welcome here third
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:24.080]  land these people are despicable scum no one should talk to them at church no
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:27.560]  one should serve them when they come in restaurants everyone should turn their
[1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:32.600]  backs on them well the way the people are gonna have to make this stand and
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:36.920]  that's what we're doing right now we're making this stand so do you know when
[1:50:36.920 --> 1:50:40.120]  the next flashpoint's coming or are they just gonna keep beating people up

[2:08:42.920 --> 2:08:46.960]  defending Russia Russia didn't start this though under common law that means the
[2:08:46.960 --> 2:08:49.760]  people running our lives are the bad guys well yeah cuz they're not Americans

[2:09:23.880 --> 2:09:28.680]  coming up ladies and gentlemen and beyond shutting down cattle ranching in
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:32.520]  this country and in Canada so the globalists can ship it all in from
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:37.440]  countries they controlled the next level of controlling cattle this is

[2:09:40.760 --> 2:09:46.600]  breaking that down as well this isn't Alex Jones reporting this this is out of
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:51.080]  the express mainstream newspaper apocalypse now why a rare astrological
[2:09:51.080 --> 2:09:55.600]  event last night could herald the end of days I don't believe that but a lot of
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:59.680]  globalists do and they tend to launch attacks on astrological timeframes and
[2:09:59.680 --> 2:10:04.280]  things we're gonna be discussing that coming out that's a large spectrum we
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:07.840]  have a Derek McBrain report that he shot for the nightly news last night and
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:11.240]  I'll tell you the nightly news is getting really great they go out and do all
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:14.840]  these special reports and interviews and everything and turn them around that
[2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.080]  same day which is so much research put into him what a great team we've got I
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:25.160]  just think my lucky stars every day for Derek McBrain and Josh Owens and just
[2:10:25.160 --> 2:10:32.480]  John Bowne and Rob do and Marcos Morales and Jocari Jackson and Leanne
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:41.600]  McAdoo and Kurt Nemo and Kit Daniels and of course a Don Salazar and Rob
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:44.800]  Jacobson and the folks that work as auxiliaries they don't work her
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:49.800]  officially but they contribute Anthony Gucci Artie, Mikhail Thalen, Paul Watson,
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:55.560]  Steve Watson, Ian Watson just just that I'm not mentioning everybody because I
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:58.760]  can't we got 40-something people here but we should get a whole list of folks
[2:10:58.760 --> 2:11:02.280]  and just thank them I don't even want to be thanked it's just that it's so good
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:05.600]  that we've over the years developed this great team what a brain trust in
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:10.560]  full wars is and I want to give the phone number out to talk about the
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:15.280]  situation in Nevada how have you been harassed by the BLM how have you been
[2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:19.680]  treated by park rangers about 10 years ago park rangers were getting really
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:23.720]  rude now they're super nice and helpful everywhere I go and I go to state and
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:29.040]  federal parks the people's parks supposedly but man BLM and arm park
[2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:34.640]  rangers meaner than rattlesnakes and they'll watch illegal aliens on the
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:37.200]  Texas border walker right across it there and write people tickets they got
[2:11:37.200 --> 2:11:40.920]  you know beer at their campsite
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:48.040]  I was sitting there in a hot springs a week and a half ago right on the Rio
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:50.920]  Grand River and there's no crime really to speak of down there because you're
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:55.360]  150 miles away from any other cities so the Mexico Texas board is very dangerous
[2:11:55.360 --> 2:11:59.440]  and you know down by Louisville orado and places but there's there's nothing
[2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:02.520]  really going on there except the legals that go back and forth mainly selling
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:07.640]  trinkets but I didn't see any of them this time and of course they got open
[2:12:07.640 --> 2:12:13.680]  range cattle and sheep right across on the National Park it's a giant Mexican
[2:12:13.680 --> 2:12:17.780]  Chihuahua National Park bigger than Big Ben and guess what you don't see
[2:12:17.780 --> 2:12:21.560]  federal East down there actually looked it up messing with them no one would
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:25.200]  even think as corrupt as Mexico is that you don't let the locals that have been
[2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:29.400]  there for hundreds of years run their cows and their sheep I'll tell you why
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:33.120]  because whether it's Chiapas or northern Mexico they won't put up with it folks
[2:12:33.120 --> 2:12:38.640]  that's how pathetic Americans are we just put up with not being able to use
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:43.040]  open range just what you're supposed to do in Russia in China in Mongolia they
[2:12:43.040 --> 2:12:48.320]  got open range people with sheep out on the big badlands because everybody goes
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:51.920]  they bring their sheep into the city they sell them that creates meat for
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:12:57.160]  China meat for Russia meat for America you're supposed to like farmers and
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:13:03.600]  ranchers but I'm sitting there with some of my buddies and it's the middle of the
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:10.160]  day and I'm sitting in a natural hot springs on the edge of the Rio Grande
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:17.160]  and all of a sudden we hear what are you doing and we turn around and there's one
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:24.360]  armed BLM park ranger he's got his hand on his gun and it was like in a movie
[2:13:24.360 --> 2:13:29.800]  where they say get ready to draw he said to his long pregnant paws and I guess
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:35.600]  he knew I was just stared at me he goes that water is a little hot and I'm very
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:39.720]  safe because they want to shut it down or something five hundred three degrees
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:45.000]  was awesome and he's kept sitting there like he was gonna intimidate me I was
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.240]  going to crap my swim shorts or something and I just sat there and we're
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:56.680]  just like okay I was drinking mineral water you know in my plastic cup he was
[2:13:56.680 --> 2:13:59.760]  just looking at us like can he find something to get us for something to
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:03.960]  there's like three of us just sitting there doing nothing in the middle of the
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:10.040]  day taking a few days off just sitting there just not allowed to I'm scum I
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:14.360]  just pay your salary everything you just suck my blood 24-7 not because you want
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:20.640]  to squat on me and let me know I'm trash then I ran into a firefighter they
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:25.080]  were down there doing controlled burns cuz they said it was invasive cane
[2:14:25.080 --> 2:14:29.720]  species he goes oh we all listen we all like it blah blah blah we saw those
[2:14:29.720 --> 2:14:35.520]  videos you did about how the park people are mean he goes I talked to I'm
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:40.400]  gonna say anymore it's I mean I'm not saying they're all bad it's just that
[2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:45.360]  it's out of control folks the government wants us to think we're scum where do
[2:14:45.360 --> 2:14:51.040]  you think this is going out there I mean this old guy this old Clive and
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:55.920]  Bundy he's just like what Americans used to be he's got the surface rights he's
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:00.240]  been using it since 1877 it's his the governor says no they've got a right to
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:05.280]  ever cattle there but they don't care they're not supposed to go in with these
[2:15:05.280 --> 2:15:09.800]  big machines and tear up the gravel roads all over the tens of millions acres in
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:13.840]  this country but they don't want you out there they've already sort of tearing up
[2:15:13.840 --> 2:15:19.280]  roads 60 miles into the Arizona border almost all the way up to Tucson and
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:23.680]  Phoenix saying don't go in here it's not safe the illegals just traipse around
[2:15:23.680 --> 2:15:28.600]  the burning down ranchers houses a dozen up at a pop they've had over a dozen
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:32.280]  homes burned in one night and I'm just saying it's total lawless if you're
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:35.400]  totally lawless they just let's do whatever you want if you're good and
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:39.880]  nice and friendly they binge you over folks let's go to Darren McBrain's report
[2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:44.760]  on the bracelets the attorney general the criminal wants us all to wear to have
[2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:48.600]  guns and the Homeland Security bracelets they want us to wear to fly an
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:52.400]  airplane that have a taser built into them here's the report by Darren McBrain
[2:15:52.400 --> 2:15:57.680]  Attorney General Eric Holder told a house appropriations subcommittee that
[2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:04.720]  his agency is looking into gun tracking bracelets to be mandatory for all gun
[2:16:04.720 --> 2:16:09.200]  owners one of the technologies that the Department of Justice is looking at is
[2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:14.440]  a recent innovation that allows gun owners to only unlock a safe with a
[2:16:14.440 --> 2:16:20.720]  fingerprint scan and an RFID equipped bracelet others have even suggested that
[2:16:20.720 --> 2:16:26.920]  making GPS tracking in RFID chips mandatory for all registered firearms
[2:16:26.920 --> 2:16:31.720]  recently Attorney General Eric Holder suggested that there be some kind of
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:36.880]  mandatory bracelet that gun owners wear that only the registered gun owner would
[2:16:36.880 --> 2:16:41.240]  have access to that gun because he was wearing a bracelet what are your thoughts
[2:16:41.240 --> 2:16:44.920]  on that I mean I think that's it's good I mean especially if they're carrying
[2:16:44.920 --> 2:16:48.480]  it around and they have the bracelet on then I guess people will be a little
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:52.440]  more comfortable knowing that this person has gone through the process in
[2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:57.040]  order to get the gun it's extremely legal and things like that that's genius
[2:16:57.040 --> 2:17:01.680]  whoever came up with that that's good I like that one thing that I think is
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:05.560]  clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be
[2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:10.040]  repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:14.080]  then only do it every Monday we need to do this every day of the week and just
[2:17:14.080 --> 2:17:18.680]  really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way that
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:23.320]  sounds like a good idea it would stop a lot of the violence obviously I guess I
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:26.880]  like that the idea a lot because I think that it would give people a lot more
[2:17:26.880 --> 2:17:30.480]  accountability to say like if you want to carry concealed weapon you need to be
[2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:35.080]  able to own that and have people know that you're carrying it by by showing
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:38.080]  them that you're carrying one that's absolutely ridiculous and infringes your
[2:17:38.080 --> 2:17:41.400]  rights in ways that and I mean who decided that safety was more important
[2:17:41.400 --> 2:17:45.000]  than my personal liberty and ability to defend my own safety rather than
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:48.280]  entrusted in them where they're all the way in Washington making these policies
[2:17:48.280 --> 2:17:52.520]  that directly affect affect my lives in ways that they can't even know if they're
[2:17:52.520 --> 2:17:57.640]  law-abiding citizens you put it like a tracking bracelet on them no no no no
[2:17:57.640 --> 2:18:03.040]  more guns less guns we think old-school ways that's what gonna make the streets
[2:18:03.040 --> 2:18:11.160]  better what's old school back in the 1980s that's old school like an old-fashioned
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:15.240]  ass-whooping yes old-fashioned ass-whooping I'm with you there I
[2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:21.280]  believe once we allow the government to start to track these individuals it is
[2:18:21.280 --> 2:18:26.680]  abridging our you know implied rights to privacy that we may have in our
[2:18:26.680 --> 2:18:31.040]  Constitution however I think there should be some sort of registration on
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:35.600]  every gun owner gun owner guns are for recreational purposes and you
[2:18:35.600 --> 2:18:39.600]  know more than one person's gonna be wanting to use it so okay you said it's
[2:18:39.600 --> 2:18:43.080]  a key thing right there you said it's for recreational purposes what about and
[2:18:43.080 --> 2:18:47.160]  also for your safety and and for you know in case so many breaks into your
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:54.600]  house what about against the tyrannical government it's in the Constitution it
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:19:00.440]  isn't the Constitution but you know I was written 250 years ago you see you
[2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:04.080]  think it's a little outdated I'd say it's a little outdated Vice President Biden
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:09.240]  and I had a meeting with a group of technology people and talked about how
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:14.520]  guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:18.960]  identification the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:25.440]  wear how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:29.880]  of of the weapon so do you think Obama appointed the right man for the job as
[2:19:29.880 --> 2:19:34.640]  far as Attorney General I think so it sounds like he's doing that's a good
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:37.680]  suggestion he's at least thinking critically about the situation and
[2:19:37.680 --> 2:19:41.160]  trying to come up with other ideas when they put explosives in okay fast and
[2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:46.920]  furious guy that's the very same one the guy who who did the the pardon at the
[2:19:46.920 --> 2:19:51.720]  end of Bill Clinton's time on that guy that basically bought his own way out
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:56.880]  of criminality so it doesn't really surprise you that it's it's his brain
[2:19:56.880 --> 2:20:02.400]  behind all this not not one bit that's genius whoever came up with that that's
[2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:05.520]  good I like that
[2:20:09.760 --> 2:20:14.560]  nice way to end the report with a street banjo player great job Darren McBrain
[2:20:14.560 --> 2:20:18.160]  that's why I want to make McBrain go out and do reports he's a great reporter
[2:20:18.160 --> 2:20:22.080]  work for all as a script showered and a couple other big places doing national
[2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:29.240]  videos and he just is a great reporter and he's an even better video editor and
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:34.320]  the concepts he comes up with and you know I want McBrain to go out and do one
[2:20:34.320 --> 2:20:40.280]  report a week and that is an absolute set deal for the news division that we
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:46.480]  send McBrain out once a week and look I made Daniels go out he was ready to do
[2:20:46.480 --> 2:20:50.520]  it and do a video report he did a great job all of you can do it and that's what
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:53.360]  I've proven with this operation I've hired people that have worked as
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:58.840]  professional reporters like John Bowne who comes from a long line of journalists
[2:20:58.840 --> 2:21:02.320]  family what his dad's a Peabody winner and and John's done national radio and
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:06.040]  and reporting he does a great job we need and I know Bowne wants to do reports
[2:21:06.040 --> 2:21:10.360]  but he's so busy I haven't I've kind of got project managers but I haven't created
[2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:15.600]  actual designated managers yet because I've got a few main managers but then
[2:21:15.600 --> 2:21:20.440]  everybody's just so busy working that I've got to just learn how to put people
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:24.000]  in charge of certain things but John Bowne does a great job on so many fronts
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:28.280]  all everybody does and then the guys behind the scenes here who don't even
[2:21:28.280 --> 2:21:32.440]  want their names known that run the radio show is the most demanding part of
[2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:38.680]  this whole operation for three four hours every day super super intense up
[2:21:38.680 --> 2:21:44.320]  here I'm told that the mighty drudge report had us top linked with a report
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:49.560]  armed federal agents surround farm that's the free beacon force we remove
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:56.080]  cattle governor calls roundup intimidation last first amendment the
[2:21:56.080 --> 2:22:02.360]  governor family wake up America they are taking everything from us so there's our
[2:22:02.360 --> 2:22:07.520]  story up on drudge report dot com standoff at Nevada Ranch see drudge you
[2:22:07.520 --> 2:22:10.240]  wonder what the Pentagon watches drudge what the State Department watches it
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:15.160]  why it's been declassified and come out in lawsuits they surveil Matt drudge Matt
[2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:18.400]  drudge is just an American who loves freedom and he knows what important
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:23.400]  news is a family surrounded with their kids getting beat up for being on the
[2:22:23.400 --> 2:22:28.040]  side of a state highway filming 250 armed men with helicopters and armored
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:33.520]  vehicles that's news and now the rancher says if they get enough people there
[2:22:33.520 --> 2:22:37.720]  they're gonna peacefully march in to the pens and take the 300 cattle that have
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:42.640]  been stolen and you know I don't think the feds the feds are lined up with
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:48.960]  snipers aimed at people to intimidate and quite frankly I've been covering this
[2:22:48.960 --> 2:22:52.240]  since last week it shows the power of info wars dot com we first began
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:58.320]  covering it drudge picked up our stories not covering what mainstream tried to
[2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:02.520]  set and say was the agenda drudge said oh this is important picked it up local
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:05.400]  news starts covering it now Sean Hannity Glenn Beck they're all covering it
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:11.000]  today and then it'll be on Fox News and it'll be ABC News tomorrow and they're
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:15.880]  gonna end up being exposed to stealing these cattle and you watch Congress will
[2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:19.600]  get involved that's what we want we don't want to shoot out to happen but I'm
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:23.720]  gonna tell the Fed something this is the type of thing you end up shooting some
[2:23:23.720 --> 2:23:27.400]  old man are you end up beating up much people it's on folks
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:31.600]  conservatives and libertarians don't go out and demonstrate we don't attack
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:36.640]  police we're law abiding you are becoming lawbreakers you work for a corrupt
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:43.920]  government and people are sick of it and let me tell you out west people are done
[2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:48.040]  being harassed by government they're done it's hard to live out west but people
[2:23:48.040 --> 2:23:55.840]  are happy out there on average and they're tired of being pushed around and the
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:23:58.360]  feds are buying all these weapons and they open your training I guess they
[2:23:58.360 --> 2:24:04.040]  just want to start something that's why they're so arrogant so aggressive and
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:08.040]  what will they do once this starts they'll blow up a federal building
[2:24:08.040 --> 2:24:11.880]  guaranteed and try to blame it and say the the militia blow up a federal
[2:24:11.880 --> 2:24:16.440]  building for Bundy and it'll they'll pick a federal building with a daycare
[2:24:16.440 --> 2:24:20.120]  center criminals do the same thing over and over again and this Justice
[2:24:20.120 --> 2:24:25.440]  Department is headed up by the man John P. Holdren who was the deputy head of the
[2:24:25.440 --> 2:24:30.040]  Justice Department and ran the cover-up we have the emails you can look up it
[2:24:30.040 --> 2:24:33.440]  was in them it was in the Utah papers because the lawsuits out there that
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:36.480]  brought it out in federal court the emails where he was like this is a d-day
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:40.400]  level emergency this is an emergency I want our agents down there and I want
[2:24:40.400 --> 2:24:48.440]  this shut down and covered up and what were they covering up well we know from
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:53.160]  the cops of course there the cops and medical workers that first showed up or
[2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:58.600]  dead but but we know and we know from Jane Graham who was told she'd be
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:02.360]  basically whacked if he didn't shut up she was there she can name the federal
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:09.680]  agents she we had exercised and take the stairwell through the maintenance hall
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:16.520]  to the ninth floor she was in in HUD the head of her department and she said it
[2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:20.000]  she goes the reason I recognize them is some of these guys were so good-looking
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:26.600]  but I've sat there and started talking to him she's been honest woman a lot of
[2:25:26.600 --> 2:25:30.160]  these evil guys are good-looking the whole point is that she sat there and
[2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:33.280]  she recognized them later on the news they were there with gray sticks of
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:38.640]  butter loading them in folks and McVeigh was there as well they declared
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:45.040]  national security on those videos all 18 of them but two valiant FBI agents
[2:25:45.040 --> 2:25:49.240]  leaked the fact that those videos existed and they saw them to the LA Times and
[2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:53.000]  both those guys ended up losing their job over it now everybody's bad in the FBI
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:57.880]  most of them grassroots are great people it's all compartmentalized folks stop
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:03.000]  being naive and they those FBI agents said they saw that video folks and six
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:08.120]  men got in and out of the rider truck and the other two cars and we know who
[2:26:08.120 --> 2:26:17.960]  those men were German intelligence ATF FBI counterterrorism we know their
[2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:24.760]  names you think it's fun to get up on air and talk about this I'm risking my
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:28.040]  life to tell you this so are the police officers we've had on here to tell you
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:33.600]  imagine being on that department where they killed cops and killed doctors and
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:39.120]  killed medical workers and they'll still come on this show and talk about what
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:44.720]  they saw even after they've been told shut up or you're dead I'm telling you
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:48.960]  when the sagebrush rebellion starts they're not gonna let it be where they
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:52.720]  shoot some old-timers and people start shooting back at the BLM the minute
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:56.440]  that happens if they let that happen the revolution will spread against the
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:02.600]  global occupiers and will be righteous like 1775 and we will win even a
[2:27:02.600 --> 2:27:07.880]  physical war very quickly the military will go in believe me and the
[2:27:07.880 --> 2:27:09.960]  criminals will be removed at a certain level there'll still be other
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:14.320]  challenges the corruption doesn't set back in the system so endemic and we
[2:27:14.320 --> 2:27:17.520]  could get the country back very very quickly the problem is the minute
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.040]  they're already with with action plans the minute they shoot some kid in the
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:25.800]  back like Viva Vendetta that's happened in Eastern Bloc countries the secret
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:30.240]  police that's based on true stories the minute something like that happens
[2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:33.640]  they're not gonna let us have the moral high ground we've held our fire we've
[2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:37.360]  put up with being basically urinated on by the globalist we've put up with every
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:41.680]  humiliation because we're smart and we know we're winning the info war we're
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:44.920]  winning the moral high ground we're waking up the military we're waking up
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:49.920]  the police we're waking up the FBI the federal marshals the state police the
[2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:56.800]  bureaucrats everybody and so the system is totally freaked out right now and the
[2:27:56.800 --> 2:28:00.120]  only thing they've got is false flag but we're exposing that their false flags
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:04.640]  with Turkey and Saudi Arabia against Syria all blew up now in New Yorker
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:08.440]  magazine Cy Hirsch we told you about it you know six months ago it was going on
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.200]  but now it's mainstream news the Navy SEALs said no to Dick Cheney's plan to
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:20.440]  blow up ships Navy SEAL ships and blame it on Iran that's come out all this
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:25.360]  stuff's coming out I didn't work anymore you could get away with this in the dark
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:29.240]  but you can't get away with it when we know and that's the great thing is my
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:34.440]  mission's already succeeded you can kill me tomorrow and everybody already knows
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:38.720]  your game plan and I can't believe that my radio show researching this with
[2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:44.120]  other experts became the fulcrum zero point that you know the patient one
[2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:49.000]  point they see us as a virus Liberty is a virus we I'm patient number one it the
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:54.720]  spread really did start here I cannot believe my life's fulfilled I don't want
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:59.480]  to die I want to be 150 I want to have seen my great-grandkids but I'm
[2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:04.920]  fulfilled I've won I'm satisfied I've been a man I've I've I've lifted

[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:06.000]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:09.600]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:13.680]  outside that's toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:17.920]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[2:30:17.920 --> 2:30:21.840]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[2:33:38.840 --> 2:33:49.720]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[2:33:49.720 --> 2:33:54.520]  Alright I'm going to go to your phone calls. Greg is a cattle rancher in Utah. Let's stick
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:34:00.560]  to us on 540 a.m. We're going to go to Eric in Kentucky who's a rancher. Jeffrey in Michigan
[2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:06.440]  a rancher. And let's talk about the bunny situation. Mike in Ohio. Feds in the courts.
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:12.520]  Clint in Ohio who's a cattle rancher. And you wonder why there's record cattle prices.
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:15.960]  It's because they've been cheating the cattle ranchers. And my family's getting out of
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:20.960]  it. Almost everybody else I know is getting out of it. Except for keeping a few cows or
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:26.400]  donkeys out there to get the tax exemption which isn't a tax exemption. Just if you don't
[2:34:26.400 --> 2:34:30.760]  have animals on it there's no way you can pay for the property. It's amazing. We're
[2:34:30.760 --> 2:34:35.840]  going to go to your calls here in just a moment. And again four students in critical condition.
[2:34:35.840 --> 2:34:40.400]  Pray for them in Pennsylvania high school stabbing. More than 20 people stabbed now they're saying.
[2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:46.080]  I've seen cases in Japan where they got killed seven children and wounded like 14 in a matter
[2:34:46.080 --> 2:34:49.320]  of minutes with a butcher knife. Well you know butcher knives got to have a waiting
[2:34:49.320 --> 2:34:54.560]  period on them or not to register them. Shouldn't joke England's actually doing that. We're
[2:34:54.560 --> 2:34:58.320]  trying to do that right now. They're proposing a license for knives over four inches to even
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.320]  have them in your house. Yeah that'll fix everything. If you can't make knives all day
[2:35:02.320 --> 2:35:09.280]  out of regular metal. LAPD officers tampered with in-car recording equipment. Shows about
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:15.600]  half the cars and secretly messed with it and turned it off. Well yeah. I mean if you
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:22.520]  can't trust police to not be listened to while they're driving around all the time. I mean
[2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:27.000]  I'm all for an in-dash deal when they go on a call for it to turn on. But I mean look
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.840]  I tell you they make the enforcers live under the police state so then they'll want us to
[2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:35.040]  live under it too. They've got things now and what is it New York other places where
[2:35:35.040 --> 2:35:41.840]  they make audio and cameras now in the taxi caps. Oh it's for everyone's safety. No it's
[2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:48.040]  not. It's a total police state. It's horrible. I mean if we can't trust the cops to not be
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:56.280]  on audio and video all the time. We can't trust them to be cops. It's unbelievable.
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:36:00.040]  This is not what a free country looks like. A free country you don't put up with corrupt
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:04.480]  people so it doesn't matter. You don't have to surveil everybody because the people themselves
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:11.520]  are innately moral and will not put up with it. As things get more and more corrupt the
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:14.840]  answer will be more and more police state which will make it worse and worse and will
[2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:20.520]  all be selectively enforced. Look at the IRS. I've seen MSNBC when I monitor it. It's got
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:25.600]  to be 20 times. Go of course they're going after the Tea Party. They need to arrest them.
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:29.440]  They did not let them have free speech because they're a bad racist group. And by the way
[2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:35.720]  they don't like Obamacare written by offshore banks. Hank Aaron compares Republicans that
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:40.760]  oppose Obama to the KKK. I have the quotes here. He said that to the 40th anniversary
[2:36:40.760 --> 2:36:55.320]  of his record-breaking 715th home run speaking to USA Today. Really, is Cynthia McKinney part
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:37:00.960]  of the Ku Klux Klan? Here's a woman honorable enough, demonized, gone after. Even back when
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:06.160]  she was anti-gun she'd exposed government child kidnapping rings with Dincor and others.
[2:37:06.160 --> 2:37:11.000]  They're the biggest CPS private contractors in Texas I should add, most other states.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:15.960]  But I'm not going to worldwide. She would expose 9-11, 2 trillion stolen from the Pentagon.
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:19.640]  She would do all that so it didn't matter if she was anti-gun. I just said, well, she's
[2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:26.080]  a real person. She's ignorant on that. Now she's anti-Obamacare, anti-New World Order,
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:31.040]  pro-gun and basically with us reaching out to her and others over the years she now
[2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:37.400]  is awake. Folks, if we can wake up mainline conservatives to be friends with liberals,
[2:37:37.400 --> 2:37:41.640]  we can just convert everyone over to being an American and to being into freedom. Let
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:47.640]  me tell you something, folks. Freedom is popular across the board. Cynthia McKinney now goes
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:54.400]  out and goes shooting. I mean, I can't tell you how many liberals I've taken shooting
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:37:59.000]  and they go, this is no big deal. This is great. This is empowering. I took a bunch
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:05.120]  of Hollywood actors out who are the cast of the new hit show on HBO, Silicon Valley with
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:12.320]  Mike Judge a few weeks ago. And they, most of them never shot guns and were been, you
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:18.400]  know, someone anti-gun. And Mike Judge got them out there on his ranch outside Austin
[2:38:18.400 --> 2:38:25.880]  and where we go shooting all the time. And they were just converted in a matter of minutes.
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:31.640]  And I watched it happen. And it was the, yeah, I'm good. I should be able to have this because
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:36.360]  only the bad guy, I want a gun. I'm going to get, it was just like, right there. I was
[2:38:36.360 --> 2:38:41.360]  like, good, go take some safety classes. You guys, this woman had never shot this actress
[2:38:41.360 --> 2:38:50.040]  and she was shooting bullseye at 200 yards with an M4 on her first shot. The gun Joe
[2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:57.200]  Biden says she shouldn't have.
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:07.720]  She was shooting at 300 yards bullseye with a 50 caliber rifle in the first five shots.
[2:39:07.720 --> 2:39:12.880]  We had like his 50 cows. It was all lined up, lined up all these guns, just all laid
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:18.840]  out safe, load them around here, put them up on his back porch. 1000 acres looking out.
[2:39:18.840 --> 2:39:24.360]  Wherever we want. It was just awesome. Big things, a Tannerite. We got some video, but
[2:39:24.360 --> 2:39:29.000]  I got a little excited. I don't think I'm going to put it out. I actually had it because
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:35.800]  I'm sitting there and I'm shooting this, I'm shooting this 308 Reaper and I'm just shooting
[2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:42.480]  a Tannerite. It's boom, boom. And I turn around like every shot I'm shooting Tannerite
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:44.920]  and I turn around, Gucci already shot the video. We're not going to put it out though
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:48.520]  because I got, I just got excited and use a little profanity and I apologize. There were
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:51.400]  no children in attendance. I'm like, you're never getting our guns. And I turn around
[2:39:51.400 --> 2:39:59.240]  right as they shoot the big charge that was under a stump, legal explosives, simulants,
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:02.920]  I guess they call them. And I ride as I turn around like it's fake, like in a movie. I
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:08.760]  go, you'll never get our guns, bleepers. And it goes, boom. And the stump blows into pieces
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:12.360]  like, you know, a hundred yards behind me. It looks like a movie is the sun setting
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:17.600]  into the setting sun. I mean, it is this video. We get 10 million views, but my tongue is
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:21.200]  literally hanging out. I look a little crazy. They'd use that against me because I mean,
[2:40:21.200 --> 2:40:26.160]  I've been out there for hours. This is so awesome. The freedom. Anyways, that's what
[2:40:26.160 --> 2:40:32.160]  they're scared of folks. They're afraid of that. All right. Um, and I was just going
[2:40:32.160 --> 2:40:40.880]  one shot, boom, full trigger, boom, full trigger, boom. I turn around and all of a sudden it's
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:45.200]  just awesome. All right. I said, I take your phone calls. Excuse me. I was having flashbacks
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:52.640]  of enjoyment. I almost call it a gun, gun, gasm. I said, I said, as a family show, but
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:59.760]  instead of a orgasm, it's a gun, gasm. And I just, it's, it's, it's the fun of that.
[2:40:59.760 --> 2:41:03.800]  It's like the fun of like throwing your line out and a huge fish comes up or like a huge
[2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:08.200]  shark and you're like, Oh my gosh, that's like an eight foot hammer. Oh, you know, it's,
[2:41:08.200 --> 2:41:12.400]  it's, it's that same feeling. It's that same feeling when you're like a thousand yards
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:17.280]  and shoot a propane tank with a 50 cow, pull the trigger first shot and it just goes, boom.
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:24.240]  I mean, it is just fun. It's fun. I'll start about the serious situation out west. Excuse
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:31.600]  me. Um, Clint in Ohio. Thank you for, no, no, no, I'm going to Clint next. Sorry. Sorry.
[2:41:31.600 --> 2:41:36.800]  I'm going to get serious, very serious situation out there in Nevada. They're saying they get
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:39.560]  the numbers there. They're going to march across and try to get the cows they've stolen
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:45.440]  from him. 300 had very serious situation. Let's go to Greg in Utah. Um, listening on
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:53.600]  K Y A H 5 40 AM says he's got information on this. Give us your take, Greg. Yeah, I
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:00.120]  just wanted to give it people a scenario that they can understand about the BLM. Okay. First
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:06.040]  of all, it stands for both Bureau of Land Management, not ownership. And if you were,
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:11.160]  if you're a landlord, say, say you have an apartment complex and you hire a manager and
[2:42:11.160 --> 2:42:16.600]  he starts kicking out your tenants and all of a sudden they're not paying any money.
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:21.280]  And the next thing you know, you find yourself into bankruptcy proceedings because you can't
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:28.520]  make the payments on that. That's the situation. I am a total fear of what's happening here.
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:32.000]  People are not going to do anything. I have a feeling until they can go to the grocery
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:37.960]  store and find out that hamburger, that package of hamburger costs 30, 50 bucks or even $100
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:43.680]  or is not even available. You know, we're the ones that we are the owners of the land
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:50.120]  that that is land that was not granted to homesteaders. That's all it is. It's public.
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:56.080]  It's ours. And they are managers and they are terrible managers. They're horrible managers.
[2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:59.440]  And we ought to paint that, you know, the work grasshopper on him because and go and
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:04.960]  watch the movie ants over and over and over again until we finally wake up because it
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:13.680]  will be a horrible, horrible day when people are left with no food on the table.
[2:43:13.680 --> 2:43:19.520]  You just crystallize it all perfectly. And the media is like, why is the governor saying
[2:43:19.520 --> 2:43:24.360]  they have a right to that land? Why is this rancher claiming, you know, he has a loyal
[2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:30.480]  title to the grazing and forage rights. What is he talking about? He's a liar. The feds
[2:43:30.480 --> 2:43:37.560]  are the boss and they said so. It's federal and state law. Going back to 1877 that he's
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:42.040]  got his little ranch bordering the larger area that no one ever even wanted to fence
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:46.240]  off her claim was theirs. And now they're saying a desert tortoise, which a Don Salazar just
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:53.040]  wrote an article before Nevada cattle rancher dispute. BLM was euthanizing. That's killing
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:58.640]  endangered desert tortoise. Months before the heated contention between Bureau of Land
[2:43:58.640 --> 2:44:03.600]  Management and Nevada cattle rancher, Clevin Bundy was just on last hour, reportedly overprotecting
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:09.200]  an endangered species of desert tortoise. The BLM was euthanizing the tortoise in droves.
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:13.440]  On Saturday, the BLM with the help of helicopters, low flying aircraft and hard cowboys began
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:18.840]  rounding up Bundy's cattle and what the man asserts is his own land. Well, it may be technical.
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:23.480]  He asserts he has the right to grazing and water rights to probably need to change that
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:28.840]  just to be technical and forbade him from interfering with the operation. As Bundy announced,
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:34.280]  he was prepared to weather a full on assault. And then it goes on. The BLM says they're
[2:44:34.280 --> 2:44:39.960]  moving in not to encroach on the man's property, but because Bundy didn't pay grazing fees,
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:46.160]  which the Bureau has imposed on land developers who disturbed tortoise habitat on public land.
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:50.440]  See, they're making it where the tortoise has the right not the person. And then it
[2:44:50.440 --> 2:44:57.440]  just goes on to talk about how they funded the desert tortoise conversation conservation
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:04.680]  program in Las Vegas, a habitat created in 1991. But the recession that followed dwindled
[2:45:04.680 --> 2:45:11.040]  the number of employees and developers and in turn funds for the DTCC. And then it goes
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:15.720]  on to talk about how they began euthanizing them. It's a good article by Adam, but we
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:18.920]  might want to put up top. See, I'm just now reading this when they handed to me to find
[2:45:18.920 --> 2:45:23.000]  the part where they're euthanizing them. Back at the Conference Conservation Center,
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:28.960]  a large refrigerator labeled carcass freezer hummed in the desert sun as scientists examined
[2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:34.920]  the facility's 1,400 inhabitants to find those healthy enough to release in the wild. So
[2:45:34.920 --> 2:45:39.360]  they were killing them. Officials expect to euthanize more than half the animals in the
[2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:43.440]  coming months in preparation for closure at the end of 2014. So they got so many of these
[2:45:43.440 --> 2:45:49.720]  turtles are killing them. So there's the report. We might just say before Nevada cattle rancher
[2:45:49.720 --> 2:45:57.200]  standoff, BLM killed 1000s of turtles, 1000s of endangered tortoise. Great job on that
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:02.480]  article. Thank you so much, Collar. Great points. Yeah. You're supposed to have these public
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:07.840]  lands so you can graze, you can use, you can hike, but they tell you where you can go.
[2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:12.280]  They tell you what you can do. And then they harass you. And then they just say, we're
[2:46:12.280 --> 2:46:19.040]  doing this arbitrarily. And now, oh, you can't have free speech anywhere in the county, except
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:23.720]  these two little red boxes we've set up and the governor saying you can't do that. Clinton,
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:26.920]  Ohio, you're on the air. Thanks for holding them. Mike, Jeffrey and Eric.
[2:46:26.920 --> 2:46:33.360]  Hello. Yes. I'm calling in, in regard of the cattle rancher and, you know, people don't
[2:46:33.360 --> 2:46:39.240]  realize how serious this is. I ran across the YouTube video. It's called Revolution in
[2:46:39.240 --> 2:46:46.040]  Nevada to Save Cliven Bundy. And, you know, it's just, it's, I think the props get into
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.960]  a boiling point and the government really needs to start listening to the people because
[2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:56.000]  this could be the very first shot, shot around, you know, the second shot heard around the
[2:46:56.000 --> 2:47:03.880]  world because this YouTube video is quite chilling, so to speak. It's called Revolution
[2:47:03.880 --> 2:47:10.360]  in Nevada to Save Cliven Bundy. Let's post that up on infowars.com right now. Check the
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:15.040]  video. If it's good guys, tweet it out at real Alex Jones. Post it on infowars.com.
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:19.080]  And if it's calling for violence, I don't want to post it because I don't want to add
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:25.200]  to that. But if it's a good video, we'll post it. The issue here is they've domesticated
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:29.120]  most Americans. They've gave them fluoride. They've dumbed them down. These old ranchers
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:34.640]  don't watch a lot of TV. These old ranchers aren't afraid to die. And they're what old
[2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:40.440]  fashion Americans were. They're, they're like the remnant, the vestigial remnants of men
[2:47:40.440 --> 2:47:44.480]  and women. And that's why the feds have always said they believe the revolution is going
[2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:50.240]  to start in the countryside. That's why there's a war on the rural communities to dumb everybody
[2:47:50.240 --> 2:47:57.040]  down or get them into the cities to control them. And a lot of these people in rural areas
[2:47:57.040 --> 2:48:02.600]  care more about not being slaves than they do about living. And it will come, push come
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:06.200]  to shove. And you have four or five more Ruby ridges. People aren't going to put up with
[2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:10.520]  it anymore. And it won't matter how many federal buildings you blow up, feds. You know, we
[2:48:10.520 --> 2:48:14.600]  know you'll pick one with a daycare center. So we can have, you know, dead kids on TV.
[2:48:14.600 --> 2:48:17.880]  People are going to see right through that when you do that. So go ahead and play your
[2:48:17.880 --> 2:48:23.360]  hand. Thank you, Clint. Mike in Ohio, feds in the courts. Then Eric, go ahead.
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:32.600]  Thanks for taking my call. You know, oftentimes people will look at like this rancher situation
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:38.000]  and just, you know, kind of like, oh, well, you know, it doesn't affect me. And not realizing
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  this affects every one of us. And you're absolutely right in your characterization of these cattle
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:51.480]  ranchers. They are people of principle, which we don't have a lot of in this country anymore.
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:56.240]  And there's not, and especially our government does not like people to stand up for principle.
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:02.760]  My fear is with these situations, what I've seen going on more and more out says is we
[2:49:02.760 --> 2:49:06.320]  used to have a country of checks and balances, or you can go to the courts and your rights
[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:13.080]  were protected. And, you know, the courts have even been compromised. And so, you know,
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:19.680]  the big concern I have is you really have little, no recourse, because even if you can
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:24.440]  go to court, which you know the deck is going to be stacked against you, you know, financially,
[2:49:24.440 --> 2:49:29.000]  like the college said before, you could be ruined and everything up, you know, all sorts
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  of other things.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:33.800]  Sure, but the problem is we're already being ruined by the system anyway. So that's why
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:38.880]  it's a rock and a hard place. I hear you and I appreciate your call. Eric in Kentucky,
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:41.480]  you're on the air on this subject. Go ahead.
[2:49:41.480 --> 2:49:43.480]  That you have.
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:50.240]  They go ahead and talk right on the telephone. Yes, sir. Expanding on your war on the real
[2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:55.360]  people. Just look what they're doing to the people in Appalachia, you know, shutting
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:50:03.480]  their minds down. Over ridiculous EPA guidelines, which we all know were just a pretense to
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:09.440]  shut those industry down. But people are moving into the dirty industry and now the
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:15.600]  dirty industry is under attack by the same EPA guidelines. They're going after the
[2:50:15.600 --> 2:50:19.960]  Amish for selling raw milk. Can you believe that raw milk?
[2:50:19.960 --> 2:50:25.480]  Well, they're they're in a war against real humans. They want us domesticated. This is
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:27.880]  a total scientific takeover. Yes, sir.
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:34.280]  Yeah, I mean, what do they think people is going to do? Once you take away their tools,
[2:50:34.280 --> 2:50:37.720]  what are they going to pick up? You know what they're going to pick up. They're going to
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:41.840]  start the arm in themselves, the bitter clingers. And they know that's all we've got. Lefts
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:46.160]  our Bibles and our guns. And they're telling people you can't homeschool your kids and
[2:50:46.160 --> 2:50:49.680]  you can't teach your kids about Christ. They're going to take that away too. Great points.

[2:54:06.760 --> 2:54:11.960]  and many others that are patiently holding Everett is in Pennsylvania since they have
[2:54:11.960 --> 2:54:22.040]  info on the tragic stabbing there at the school. No one's going to say blame the knives. Why
[2:54:22.040 --> 2:54:26.480]  do you say blame a gun? Because about a third of the public's never shot a gun or been around
[2:54:26.480 --> 2:54:30.280]  guns and they're scared of them. Everybody's used a knife so they're like, no, we're not
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:36.080]  going to blame knives. I use a knife every day. They want to keep you away from it so
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:41.640]  you don't become proficient with it. The answer to them wanting to domesticate us is arming
[2:54:41.640 --> 2:54:47.160]  and gardening and loving and having a barbecue and inviting your neighbors over and telling
[2:54:47.160 --> 2:54:53.640]  jokes and playing cards or dominoes. The answer is going out and helping homeless people or
[2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:57.200]  going out for meals on wheels or loaves and fishes of the Salvation Army. The answer is
[2:54:57.200 --> 2:55:05.400]  getting real. The answer is try to stay out of fights when somebody starts one, stomp
[2:55:05.400 --> 2:55:10.000]  their head in the ground. The answer is becoming human again. By the way, this hour is brought

[2:56:09.560 --> 2:56:14.200]  it. Jeffrey in Michigan, you're on the air. Go ahead, your take on the situation.
[2:56:14.200 --> 2:56:20.440]  Yes, sir. Yeah, Mr. Bundy, I think, is cut from the same cloth as the World War II veterans
[2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:24.800]  in the Battle of Athens that came back from World War II and took their county back in
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:28.840]  1946 from Tyrants. And although it's a different scenario...
[2:56:28.840 --> 2:56:33.160]  Oh yeah, oh yeah. I mean, the Battle of Athens, the government wasn't even doing stuff as
[2:56:33.160 --> 2:56:37.160]  bad as what the BLM is doing. I mean, no one would have put up with this. That's why it
[2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:44.120]  never happened. These men, including Mr. Bundy, have that resistance that you were speaking
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:48.240]  about earlier in their DNA and it's right there on the surface. So they won't be walking.
[2:56:48.240 --> 2:56:52.960]  I'm like, you just said in this interview, we're going to take our cattle back. If people
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:58.640]  know what happens when you wait and see, Ruby Ridge, they waited it out and people saw what
[2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:04.480]  happened. Now we have all the media on them and I think that's what real people do when
[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:08.160]  they're confronted with this type of force and tyrannical...
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:13.640]  Well, you get to the point where you can't help it anymore. And it's just like when somebody
[2:57:13.640 --> 2:57:19.400]  walks up and punches you in the nose. I want to fix this. I want to use Congress to get
[2:57:19.400 --> 2:57:26.320]  control of the BLM. But I mean, I never got to this today. The new republic run by the
[2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:31.520]  Democrats is bragging that the Republicans are helping keep Obamacare in place. And they
[2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:35.440]  just... Of course, because they helped write it. It's so sick, these criminals. God bless
[2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:40.400]  you. I appreciate your call. Pitchfork Man in Arizona, your take on this, sir.
[2:57:40.400 --> 2:57:43.760]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing today? I'm all right, brother.
[2:57:43.760 --> 2:57:49.760]  Hey, a long time listener, first-time caller. I live in Mojave County, which is adjacent
[2:57:49.760 --> 2:57:55.560]  to Clark County and we suffer from the same abuses from the BLM as Mr. Bundy. I ran...
[2:57:55.560 --> 2:58:00.720]  Are they rude to you like they are to me? They're rude to our people. They're blocking
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:07.320]  off our roads in our area where we've four-wheeled and ridden our four-wheelers for a long time.
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:12.640]  Also not so much rude, but they're kind of a leech to our system. I ran for county supervisor
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:20.320]  and lost by 140 votes. I'm running for judge this next election period. But the BLM is
[2:58:20.320 --> 2:58:25.880]  working with the British Petroleum to put in a wind farm in our county. And they're
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:33.080]  putting it on public land and on part of the Grand Canyon National Park. Oh, I know. They're
[2:58:33.080 --> 2:58:37.200]  going to use it with globalists to develop it. And that's why they want you kicked off
[2:58:37.200 --> 2:58:41.400]  of it. Great point. Write an article about it. And maybe we'll get you on the show. Everybody
[2:58:41.400 --> 2:58:45.320]  should use it. Don't just count on us. There's too much happening. Talk about that. I remember
[2:58:45.320 --> 2:58:49.360]  seeing that in the news. Overdrive coming up, infowars.com, force last show of your station.
[2:58:49.360 --> 2:58:54.400]  Don't carry it. The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[2:58:54.400 --> 2:58:59.560]  They are manipulating our genetics. We are being targeted at every level by estrogen
[2:58:59.560 --> 2:59:04.200]  mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that
[2:59:04.200 --> 2:59:09.000]  the body needs. After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we

[3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:37.320]  Hello. I was a journalist in Escalante, Utah shortly after they designated the grand staircase
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:43.000]  or I should say stole 2.1 million acres in the dead of night. The governor there didn't
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:47.600]  even know they were stealing it. Locals didn't know they were stealing it. Anyway, shortly
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:57.160]  thereafter they booted the cows off the land and that in turn forced the grazers to sell
[3:00:57.160 --> 3:01:03.920]  their grazing rights and who bought it was a large environmental group from Flagstaff,
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:10.080]  Arizona where I've lived predominantly most of my life and their plans were to retire
[3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:15.680]  their grazing permits altogether and rest the land. Well, that ended up in a court battle
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:21.080]  and that was proven wrong because by law they have to notify Congress when they're eliminating
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:25.120]  one of the most important. It's nature conservancy, Sierra Club, they're all banking fronts,
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:28.800]  nothing to do with the environment. It's a total takeover of the country. They want
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:31.320]  you to not be on the public land because they're going to turn around and basically
[3:01:31.320 --> 3:01:37.800]  sell it to insiders. I wrote a big article about the Grand Canyon Trust here in Flagstaff.
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:42.280]  I was an environmentalist at that time and the ranchers kept telling me that they were
[3:01:42.280 --> 3:01:47.160]  tied to the World Bank and everything. I said, no way. Well, that was published by Range
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:53.520]  Magazine. But the point I want to make is that these ranchers have a long time investment
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:02:01.560]  in their herd. In Escalani, they couldn't get all of the cows because they're basically
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:07.040]  a wild animal out there. So they used helicopters and they drove them over those steep cliffs.
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:10.960]  And broke their legs. Sure, sure. And for those that don't know, your whole life's
[3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:15.560]  based on this herd, you can barely live on it anyways. And there's no money in cattle
[3:02:15.560 --> 3:02:19.360]  now because of the manipulation at the top by the meatpackers and the distributors. That's
[3:02:19.360 --> 3:02:23.120]  where everybody's going out of the business and it will destroy you to do this. Tell us
[3:02:23.120 --> 3:02:31.760]  the name of your article. The one in the Range Magazine is Don't Trust the Trust. Don't
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:35.720]  Trust the Trust. Great job. Going to jump. Maybe we'll get you on about that. There's
[3:02:35.720 --> 3:02:40.240]  all these callers I want to go to. Sean and Ace and Michael. Evert has got info from
[3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:43.800]  Pennsylvania on the stabbing. Well, the answer is ban the knives. Go ahead.
[3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:50.760]  Alex, the situation, 20 students stabbed about 20 miles, 30 miles east of Pittsburgh, a school
[3:02:50.760 --> 3:02:54.960]  Franklin regional. The information I have now, this is coming from a person that has
[3:02:54.960 --> 3:02:59.840]  been threatened twice in my life with deadly force by policemen. So I understand the trauma
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:05.920]  that this can cause someone. However, I recorded this recording. This school district has been
[3:03:05.920 --> 3:03:12.600]  used as an example of why we need to have officers in the school that we've actually
[3:03:12.600 --> 3:03:17.120]  fought against. And now this is where this happens and they didn't use deadly force.
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:21.600]  I want to play this clip. The reporter asked, it's kind of hard to hear, was the school
[3:03:21.600 --> 3:03:26.120]  resource officer armed and why did he not discharge his weapon? Can I play this clip
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:37.080]  for you? Okay, yes, play it. Well, there's really no need to discharge a weapon. We
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:42.240]  only do that in the situation we feel that it is needed to. The situation was brought
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:46.800]  under control in the best manner it was. Could you hear that? Yeah, so they didn't shoot
[3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:51.280]  the 16 year old reportedly in custody who stabbed more than 20 people for him in critical
[3:03:51.280 --> 3:03:57.160]  condition. What what newscast was that off of? It was on all three channels. Channel
[3:03:57.160 --> 3:04:01.280]  two, guys, let's find that that's newsworthy that you got an armed cop and they didn't
[3:04:01.280 --> 3:04:05.920]  shoot the person doing this. There's no end of government. I mean, I guess their answer
[3:04:05.920 --> 3:04:09.720]  was somebody tackled them or something. So, you know, maybe you don't shoot them then,
[3:04:09.720 --> 3:04:14.840]  but sounds very suspicious. The thing is, if it was staged, because I know they were
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:19.680]  having drills in the area a few days ago, why wouldn't they do it with a gun? You know,
[3:04:19.680 --> 3:04:25.120]  because what do you think's going on here? The principle was who tackled him, not the
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:30.000]  resource officer, the resource officer who was armed called 911. So literally stood
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:35.160]  there and let the person dead is what you're saying. Well, the news reports that are coming
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:39.240]  through is they keep saying that every there, you know, the EMS did a good job. The doctors
[3:04:39.240 --> 3:04:42.640]  did a good job. The police responded really. That's all they ever do. Like Fort Hood took
[3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:45.880]  15 minutes. I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around, but other people pull knives on
[3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:52.240]  me twice. And I mean, you know, say I wasn't the one that went to the hospital. And so
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:57.400]  I just can't believe that they let this person stab 20 people. All right, folks, not only
[3:04:57.400 --> 3:05:00.360]  news tonight, seven o'clock back tomorrow. Lord willing, we'll try. We'll track this
[3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:18.800]  ranching thing.
