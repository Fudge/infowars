[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:05.000 --> 00:07.000]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.000]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but...
[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  Yes, exactly.
[00:12.000 --> 00:17.000]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time,
[00:17.000 --> 00:21.000]  but now they banned him, they banned his little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  Now that they kick them off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  I have no issue with it at all. I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted,
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  Don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be, again, live here the next four hours.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  Tom Pappert is going to be in the studio with us.
[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  I'm with Shroyer with Youth News, Will Johnson with a lot of big, important announcements,
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  and Dr. Nick Baggage as well on this live, global, original Friday transmission.
[01:40.000 --> 01:46.000]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  When we come back, I'm going to launch into our top story.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  And I'm going to, again, sit here and ponder what that top story is.
[01:57.000 --> 02:04.000]  But I think the takeaway from all of the big developments that are unfolding that are unbelievably important
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  is that there are evil people and there are good people in the world.
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  And most the good people are asleep.
[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000]  And the bad people are spending their time trying to keep the good people asleep.
[02:17.000 --> 02:24.000]  The Washington Post and CNN like to talk about the post-truth era
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  when we've been in the post-truth era for the last really 50, 60 years,
[02:28.000 --> 02:37.000]  and now so-called mainstream media has been intensifying their lies to staggering levels.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  And then those of us that question their lies, well, they then say that we're the liars
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  who need to be locked up, who need to be put in prison.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  I saw a Yahoo story this morning without looking.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  I was on the front page of Yahoo.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  Alex Jones loses Sandy Hook, lawsuit appeal, fake news, not true.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  And I sat there for like 30 minutes.
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.000]  I got up at 5 a.m. I was helping my middle daughter on homework, so she got up early at 6 a.m.
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  But before that, when I was making breakfast and doing stuff at like 5.15,
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  sort of making breakfast for the family.
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  I liked doing it.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  I was sitting there with an iPad laying on the counter in between reading the comments.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  And I could do a whole four-hour show on that.
[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  The viciousness, the delusion, the comments.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  He needs to be in a forced labor camp.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  He needs to die.
[03:32.000 --> 03:34.000]  I hope he gets killed.
[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  Thank God he's going to go bankrupt and be shut down.
[03:38.000 --> 03:48.000]  And then comments like, I bet his viewers and listeners, I bet they think this is fake news.
[03:48.000 --> 03:53.000]  So I probably read, let's not exaggerate, I can read pretty fast, 300 comments.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  In like the 10 minutes I looked at it, maybe 20 minutes off and on.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  I mean, I couldn't turn away.
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  Like cooking eggs and cutting up strawberries and baking biscuits and getting jelly out and hot sauce.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  Grilling myself some onions for my omelette I was making and getting the homework stacked up over on the bar area
[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  where we were going to do the simple, you know, 6th grade math.
[04:18.000 --> 04:26.000]  And I was just engrossed in it because you could teach a college course on the mental illness of those people.
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  And how controlled they were and how they were all just parroting the same thing.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  And then maybe every 20th comment, yeah, that's the Hill version.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  It's on the front page of Yahoo!, at least it was this morning.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  You know, it's the same headline.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  It's like 2,500 comments as of this morning, probably this morning now.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  But it's on the front page of Yahoo!, you can just go there, you'll see it.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  And it was just total lies and viciousness of authoritarianism and calling for my head.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  This is a group of authoritarian criminals down to the grassroots.
[05:24.000 --> 05:33.000]  Band.Video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationals, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals

[05:58.000 --> 06:19.000]  Band.Video.
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  It is Friday, September 6, 2019.
[06:34.000 --> 06:45.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones here live on air in defiance of the globalist attacks and their hateful will.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  Thanks to God and thanks to you.
[06:49.000 --> 06:57.000]  Thanks to this crew and thanks again to the Providence that put me in the position to see what the globalists were doing.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  25, 26 years ago would decide to take action.
[07:01.000 --> 07:13.000]  Now I had a vision of what I was going to do and I always expected to trigger others to take action and reverse the course of the post-human era.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  I never really imagined that I would end up in a leadership position.
[07:18.000 --> 07:32.000]  My main goal that I've been stating for 25 years is to spur folks from what you'd call the leadership ranks of society to not destroy their own birthright and destroy their own bloodline,
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  signing on to what is true, raw, bona fide evil.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  But we're here and we've changed the course of history.
[07:43.000 --> 07:53.000]  We've done this together and we are now in the middle of a battle that is very intense and could go either way.
[07:53.000 --> 08:05.000]  That's why the forces of evil, of dehumanization, of greed and hatred and lies are so angry and throwing out all the stops right now.
[08:05.000 --> 08:24.000]  Because humanity was asleep and their victory was almost complete, but in the 11th hour, 58th minute, the spirit of humanity began to rekindle its fire.
[08:24.000 --> 08:33.000]  And that's why we see all the intimidation and all the authoritarianism and all the attempts to bankrupt and attack anyone.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  That criticizes these authoritarian control freak bullies in any way.
[08:38.000 --> 08:51.000]  Because they had all of this already planned, they're now just throwing their full will at us in an attempt to make us reverse course, but that's not going to happen.
[08:51.000 --> 09:01.000]  Real leadership is not even being a good speaker. Real leadership is not being able to convince people to do things.
[09:01.000 --> 09:12.000]  Leadership that's positive is doing things you know or write that you know are going to end up hurting you,
[09:12.000 --> 09:30.000]  but end up in the end being proven right and launching whole new human systems of success and empowerment and enlightenment as humans ascend and become closer to God.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  That's leadership.
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.000]  Sabotaging culture, learning how to manipulate people, engaging in deception is cancer.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  It's knowledge of evil. It's a virus. It manipulates systems that already existed and causes entropy and collapse.
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.000]  It does not pro-generate. It does not fount. It does not found.
[09:54.000 --> 10:11.000]  It is not a source. It is not a creator. It is not a builder, a constructor, an expander. They are collapses.
[10:11.000 --> 10:27.000]  I do not wish to spend with my spiritual will, eternity with such, but I must then strive on this plane to resonate with the light.
[10:27.000 --> 10:41.000]  And not the Luciferian false light of Lucifer the bearer who catches God's light and convinces you he's God because he reflects it, but he is not the source.
[10:41.000 --> 10:53.000]  Satan is the count or fit or not the bona fide, not the bones, not the guts, not the source.
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.000]  Now let me mention what's coming up today because it's incredibly informative.
[10:58.000 --> 11:06.000]  Head of the United Nations Global Communications says illegally entering the U.S. is a right.
[11:06.000 --> 11:11.000]  But you try to enter the U.N. building. They will arrest you.
[11:11.000 --> 11:18.000]  And if they charge you with fake war crimes, they'll poison you in your jail cell like Slovan Milošević.
[11:18.000 --> 11:25.000]  Turkey threatens to flood Europe with migrants. See how it all ties together?
[11:25.000 --> 11:32.000]  Alleged ISIS, indicted, came to U.S. on visa lottery from Kazikistan to kill.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  Johnson says he'd rather be dead in a ditch than ask EU for a Brexit delay.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  So he's fighting to deliver on that so they can get control of their borders again.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  Russia offered to sell Trump hypersonic weapons, Putin says.
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.000]  Mad as hell, Hong Kong or screaming out of apartment blocks every night at 10 p.m.
[11:51.000 --> 11:58.000]  Finland, Christian, member of parliament under police hate crime investigation after posting Bible verse.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  Paul Joseph Watson in FullWars.com.
[12:01.000 --> 12:09.000]  Township shuts down 100-year-old fire department after one member tried to join the Proud Boys.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  That's your virtue signaling.
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.000]  That's right, punish the whole fire department and let the citizens burn to death
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  because the leftists will teach you that even being near someone proud of America will cause everyone to lose their jobs.
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.000]  That's what the Nazis would do. If one German soldier got killed, they'd kill 15 people in town.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  If an officer got killed, they'd kill 100. And if an SS officer got killed, they'd kill thousands.
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  Famous cases of that.
[12:34.000 --> 12:41.000]  Soccer fans banned from flying Betsy Ross abolitionist flag in Utah.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  That's right, can't fly that at a soccer game, you can fly whatever you else want,
[12:44.000 --> 12:52.000]  but people are offended by the original American flag designed by George Washington
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.000]  and sewn by Betsy Ross, that evil Christian abolitionist.
[12:57.000 --> 13:04.000]  Facebook will actively push CDC vaccine info, hide data and safety, and the inserts will not be allowed.
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  That's right, Facebook now banning. David Knight covers a report.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  Anyone posting the insert that comes with it.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  Can't show you that insert saying it can kill you.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  Oh, thanks for keeping a safe Facebook.
[13:19.000 --> 13:30.000]  But the fact rates 100% real photo of Biden with KKK Grand Dragon as mostly false.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  That's right. Isn't that just amazing?
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  You know, I had free Ricky Ross in here, and he's a smart guy,
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  and he'd never heard Hillary Clinton say black people are super predators need to be brought to heal like dogs.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  That's a quote, by the way. You mean to play it again for you?
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  You know what? Go look it up yourself if you want to see it.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  I mean, this is the magnitude.
[13:52.000 --> 13:55.000]  Like Bernie Sanders saying we need to abort the brown and black babies.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  He actually said that two days ago, but that's okay.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  He's Bernie Tenders.
[14:00.000 --> 14:07.000]  Now, Hitler said it'd be bad, but when Bernie Tenders did, I did, I did.
[14:07.000 --> 14:13.000]  Researchers blame marriage rate decline on lack of economically attractive men.
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  Yes, that's what women have been taught. What matters is someone that's loving and hard working
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  and cares about God and wants to have children with you.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  That statistically is going to make you happy.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  But see, they've taught women and men that if you don't have all the bling, you're a nobody.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  Meanwhile, your children are being taught by convicted pedophiles at Drag Queen Storytime.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  Biden says, hell yes. I'll appoint Barack Obama to Supreme Court.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  Another reason that despite the fact Trump isn't perfect, he's done light years better than Hillary.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  And we got two decent Supreme Court justices compared to what we would have gotten.
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  We would have been sunk.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  And then all we would have had is a civil war to stop them.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  Meanwhile, Portland cops say it's legal for homeless to defecate in public.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  And of course, just north of there, they're now saying they're not going to wash the poop off the streets
[15:02.000 --> 15:08.000]  because it's a sign of abuse to the homeless and reminds them of black people being sprayed
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  with water hoses, fire hoses in the civil rights movement.
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  And Owen Schreuer will be in studio in fours exclusive.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  Austin, Texas rapidly spiraling into a hellhole.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  Owen Schreuer, Savannah Hernandez and others did a great job at city council breaking it down.
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  This is a designed system to bring cities down and then bring hundreds of millions of dollars
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  into the Democrat city councils whose wives and husbands run the systems that cater
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  and sell the drugs to the slugs.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  So Austin, Texas falling into a leftist black hole by design.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  Meanwhile, they're really big news.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  We'll go through all of this.
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  Americans have become children in major studies demanding, dependent and needy.
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Always happens before the collapse.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  And Buddha judge says Christians are going to have a reckoning.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  He's coming for you.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  they thought might never be solved.

[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[16:33.000 --> 16:38.000]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  At Heart and Body Extract.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[17:03.000 --> 17:05.000]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:07.000 --> 17:13.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits

[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[18:02.000 --> 18:03.000]  Alex, God bless you.
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt instead of this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,
[18:09.000 --> 18:12.000]  this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  Oh, yeah.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  Showing your brain, getting frat.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[18:16.000 --> 18:17.000]  Totally changed my life.
[18:17.000 --> 18:23.000]  I use Turboforce, Bodies, Alba Power, Brain Force, Fish Oil, Ultra 12, Daily, X2 every several days.
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  that I get by combining all your products and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them.
[18:33.000 --> 18:34.000]  I just want to say why not.
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation, now you can build the big strong temple.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  and then it funds the Information War, which is so critical.
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[19:00.000 --> 19:06.000]  SuperMell Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[19:06.000 --> 19:15.000]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[19:15.000 --> 19:16.000]  It is cold pressed.
[19:16.000 --> 19:22.000]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  It's not boiled.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  It's not heated.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  It's never been dried.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  That's why it's so strong.
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.

[19:59.000 --> 20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Somebody calls you.
[20:32.000 --> 20:35.000]  You answer quite slowly.
[20:35.000 --> 20:42.000]  A girl with colliders go by.
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  Santa Fe flowers look yellow and green.
[20:49.000 --> 20:54.000]  Towering over your head.
[20:54.000 --> 21:01.000]  Don't fall again with the sun in her eyes as she's gone.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
[21:05.000 --> 21:06.000]  Think about that.
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  I wonder what he's talking about.
[21:12.000 --> 21:20.000]  Have you ever looked into a clear blue sky laying out on a green hill in the fall
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  and just laid there for hours on a blanket and then watched the sun slowly set?
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  You can see the diamond lattice of the universe.
[21:30.000 --> 21:33.000]  God's handiwork in the firmament.
[21:33.000 --> 21:36.000]  And you don't even need to be on LSD to see it.
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  That's the amazing part.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  All right, let's get really serious here, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  Because we're in a serious world.
[21:48.000 --> 21:54.000]  We have Biden saying, hell yes, I'll appoint Barack Obama to the Supreme Court.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  Here's old red-eye himself.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  Have you called him for advice?
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  I talked to Barack and I...
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  When was the last time you talked to him?
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  I guess now. It's about three, four weeks ago.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  Okay.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  Would you appoint him to the Supreme Court?
[22:09.000 --> 22:15.000]  Hell, yes.
[22:15.000 --> 22:18.000]  I don't think you'd do it, but I...
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  There's a constitutional professor at the University of Chicago.
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  No, no, I understand. He's fully qualified.
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  Have you asked Michelle Obama for advice?
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  Only to be my vice president.
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.000]  I'm only joking. Michelle, I'm joking.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.000]  I was a joke.
[22:34.000 --> 22:42.000]  All right, now again, I told you two months ago that I was told by folks that were involved in his security detail
[22:42.000 --> 22:47.000]  because he gets a secret service, the same type of folks that told me Hillary's in a black ambulance.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  She's falling down, having convulsions every 45 minutes.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  Remember we told you that first, then they got caught on tape in New York?
[22:54.000 --> 22:59.000]  We caught her on tape at an emergency tent for an hour and a half in Ohio.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  Millie Weaver and her crew did.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Remember three-plus years ago during the campaign?
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  Well, the same people, similar people, the same agency said,
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  listen, Joe's cussing, yelling, why am I doing this? Why am I here? I should just quit.
[23:12.000 --> 23:15.000]  They had articles saying that was fake news.
[23:15.000 --> 23:16.000]  Oh, now the headlines.
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  AP Politico this week.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  Can Biden do it? Is he too old? Will he drop out?
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  Pressure amounts for him to drop out.
[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  And then it came out, what, three days ago.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  Obama told him, do not run. You're too old.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  Don't do it.
[23:34.000 --> 23:43.000]  And there you go. And now his eye blood vessels start breaking during the speech.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  He's on blood thinners.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  He had one of the worst type of strokes you can have at the base of your brain.
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  They thought he would probably die from it.
[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  He lived. That was back in the 90s.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  And he's clearly had a stroke since then because he was a well-spoken guy three years ago.
[24:00.000 --> 24:05.000]  I mean, anybody knows Biden's slick talker. He can't talk anymore.
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.000]  He's had a stroke. He's had a stroke. He's had a stroke.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  And so what does that mean?
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  Well, it means Elizabeth Warren.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  That's really who you're probably looking at or maybe Camilla Harris,
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  but she pulls it 1% with black Americans.
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.000]  I mean, black Americans know that lady in black.
[24:28.000 --> 24:33.000]  And it's nothing against her that she's Indian and maybe 5% African American or something.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  That's fine. Our first female president will be Indian.
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  But she's just not black.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  And she also was a mastermind at locking black people up.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  She was one of the most vicious in California history.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  So Elizabeth Warren and that's who Trump's actually worried about.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  Because a bunch of women will vote for old meth eyes.
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  Boy, does she look like she's on some speed at these debates.
[24:55.000 --> 25:00.000]  That old mean looking praying man is that cutthroat corporate Raider lawyer
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  because she's a woman. That's it because I'm a woman because I'm a woman.
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  Now, moving on to some more of these vicious, vicious, vicious individuals.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  We have folks running around like Mayor Pete Buttigieg
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  say the Republican Party and Christianity are due for a reckoning
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  because we hurt children by stopping them in immigrant centers
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  that Obama's buddies built and got money for before he left office
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  when he encouraged everyone to flood our borders and get amnesty.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  He creates the problem, makes hundreds of millions for his buddies.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  That's come out in the news. It's billions now.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  Running all of these, Trump upgrades them, makes them better.
[25:41.000 --> 25:45.000]  They show old videos of kids in cages behind barbed wire.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  We're behind, you know, cyclone fence, actually not even barbed wire.
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  Blame Trump and then this guy says, oh, Democrats love kids.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Yeah, Democrats love to have pedophiles.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  Democrats love to do forced inoculations.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Democrats love to kill babies after they're born.
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  You love partial birth abortion.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  I mean, you guys are still in their future.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  You guys say there's too many kids. We shouldn't have kids.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  But now, Buddha judge, he is the judge of who's good for children.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  Yes.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  Look, we all have very different, obviously,
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  for as long as there has been faith and as long as there has been politics,
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  there have been different understandings on the right thing to do
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  and how these things fit together.
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  But for the party and the movement known for beating other people on the head
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  with their faith or their interpretation of their faith,
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  it makes no sense to literally vote to take food away from the hungry,
[26:42.000 --> 26:47.000]  to essentially be practicing the very thing that,
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  not just a Christian scriptural tradition,
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  but so many others tell us we're not supposed to do in terms of harming other people.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  And I do think there's going to be a reckoning over that.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  Because there are a lot of people, I think, sitting in the pews,
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  hearing political conservatism all around them,
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  wondering whether that really matches what we're being told to do.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  Not to mention how we're supposed to do it, right?
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  Another very powerful image that I see in Scripture is that of foot washing.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  God comes among us.
[27:18.000 --> 27:21.000]  And instead of expecting to be exalted,
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  is washing people's feet?
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  What a little demonic pig.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  Get him off there.
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  You mean like all the homeless with the heroin being shipped in,
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  robbing people, pissing on the street,
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  not even using porta-potties,
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  crapping and going,
[27:34.000 --> 27:37.000]  we got video of that today and the police going,
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  this is sacrament.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  Literally.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  I can play you news clips of city council members and Portland going,
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  it's fun, we poop on the street.
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  I'm not kidding. Woo, poopers, let's poop.
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.000]  These are scum who want to exploit everything good in your face.
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  They're conquerors.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  They're trash.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  They're filth.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  They're devils.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Speaking of that, the bug-eyed chipmunk,
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  Balazi Ford admits she did all the Kavanaugh stuff
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  and all the other fake garbage.
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  She never met Kavanaugh.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  All the other women have come out and said that they were liars.
[28:06.000 --> 28:07.000]  Each of them have been indicted.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.000]  Don't hear about that.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  She said she did it because of abortion.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  That's why she went and lied,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  because she wants to kill those babies.
[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  Her and Buddha judge love those babies.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  Bernie Sanders loves them too,
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  especially the black ones.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  He says we got to,
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  we got to get more aggressive in Africa and Latin America
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  to abort the babies.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  Here she is.
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Here's the bug-eyed weasel.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  Aftermath of these hearings,
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  I believe that Christine's testimony brought about more good
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  than the horror misogynist Republicans
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  caused by allowing Kavanaugh on the court.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  That's your lawyer.
[28:39.000 --> 28:40.000]  He's going to have a conservative.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  A serpent woman.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  Elections have consequences.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  But he will always have an asterisk next to his name.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  When he takes a scalpel to Robey Wade,
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  we will know who he is,
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  we know his character,
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  and we know what motivates him.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  These people have no morals.
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  She goes on.
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  No morals.
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists,
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  get back to nature.

[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  and even helps protect DNA.

[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  make it easy to see
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  why so many listeners swear by DNA Force Plus.

[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  And that's why we're introducing
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.000]  what we know is going to be
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  a massive best seller,
[31:04.000 --> 31:05.000]  Killforce.
[31:05.000 --> 31:06.000]  Now let's look at what's in
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  this powerful formula.
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  Ashwagandha root extract.
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  An ancient medicinal herb
[31:12.000 --> 31:13.000]  used for over 3,000 years
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  to treat stress and relax the patient.
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.000]  L-theony.
[31:16.000 --> 31:17.000]  A special amino acid
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  naturally found in some tea leaves.
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  The compound has been called
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  the stress killer
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  Gabba.
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.000]  An important neurotransmitter
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  that controls functions of the body and mind,
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  including nervous system relaxation.
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  Gabba is a choice for many
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  to help produce anxiety.
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  Rodeola rosea root extract
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  This root is considered a super adaptogen
[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  and is believed to help the body
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  in the fight against emotional,
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  mental, and physical stress.
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  It's time to do what I did
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  and take action with the
[31:50.000 --> 31:51.000]  Killforce challenge at
[31:51.000 --> 32:20.000]  www.killforcelive.com
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's now live.
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  Band.video
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  Band.video isn't just
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  going to be a home for Alex Jones
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  or David Knight or Owen Troyer
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  or Paul Watson band videos.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  We are building it to be a place where
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  band memes are able to be posted
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  and where a growing list of
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  freedom-loving contributors are able to
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  have a home free from being shut down,
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  free from being censored,
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  free from being silenced by big tech,
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  the chai comms, the Hollywood scum,
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  and the globalist.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  Freedom of speech has a home.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  It's called Band.video.
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  America and the world is fighting back
[32:57.000 --> 32:59.000]  against tyranny at Band.video.
[33:03.000 --> 33:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  He aligns himself with the truth
[33:09.000 --> 33:11.000]  and it's time for you to
[33:11.000 --> 33:13.000]  choose a side.
[33:13.000 --> 33:15.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:17.000 --> 33:19.000]  Something really big
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  is happening right now
[33:21.000 --> 33:23.000]  and I see it everywhere without
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  even looking and I'm not
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  bringing this up because it's
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  about important.
[33:29.000 --> 33:31.000]  It's about important.
[33:31.000 --> 33:33.000]  It's about important.
[33:33.000 --> 33:35.000]  It's about important.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  I'm not bringing this up because it's
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  about important.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  It's because it's a bellwether
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  or a barometer, it's a gauge,
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  it's a major indicator.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  Without looking,
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  I see on YouTube
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  and in comment sections
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  from
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  Yahoo to the
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  Washington Times liberal conservative
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  people just randomly saying
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  Alex Jones is right.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  He was right about human animal cloning.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  He was right about Epstein and
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  pedophile rings and even said
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Epstein was into eugenics.
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  Well, he headed up the Rockefeller eugenics
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  operation
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  which was the
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  Albert Einstein Institute in New York.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  He was in the news decades ago.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  I know who the guy is.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  I track these people.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  So it's not like, again, there's some
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  magical crystal ball here.
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  I've got a time machine.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  That's what's so frustrating is 99%
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  the other 1% is what the globalists
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  really believe they're doing
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  and they're religion which is
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  like a science fiction horror movie.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  Of course, we're on a planet
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  and a lot of weird stuff is going on
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  so it turns out what they believe is
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  actually what the Bible says they believe.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  They worship a fallen offworld
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  eternal entity
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  that's not very friendly.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  Let me just leave it at that.
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  It's a planet killer.
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  So that's where we are.
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  The other 99% is all admitted.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  And so the good news is
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  people are waking up. The bad news is
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  the system is cracking down and really throwing
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  the book at everybody
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  and that's why it's so essential
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  now that everyone realize we're entering
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  a real flux point, a real time of change
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  and all of your action and what you do
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  now today will echo through eternity
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  so I'm asking all listeners
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  to remember that the power
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  of this broadcast
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  is you. It's not like you're just a leg
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  of it or you're an arm
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  of it or you're part of the brain. You're the
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  whole shooting match.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  It's you they hate. It's you they want
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  to silence. It's you they want to disarm.
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  It's your children they want to poison and dumb down
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  and mislead into hell
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  with them for eternity.
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  And so I'll say it again
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  your word of mouth spreading the word
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  however you're listening however you're watching
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  continually is unstoppable.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  Your financial support is central
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  and your prayers are absolutely
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  eternal and absolute and I must have
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  them and I need them so I thank you for them.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  We make it very easy
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  to support this broadcast. We go out and get the
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  best water filtration, the best air filtration,
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  the best non-GMO seeds, great designer
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  Patriot clothing to spread the word and
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  have fun
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  and meet like-minded people and
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  I go out and find out what are the best
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  selling supplements and
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  Neutropics and Neutroceuticals
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  and then we make them better with top labs
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  that are already top tested
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  because we know we're targets plus we want it to work great for you
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  and then we discount it.
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  So if you want real supplements the very best that are
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  out there that will blow away anything
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  you're going to find anywhere unless it's three
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  or four times the price
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  is MFullWareStore.com
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  MFullWareLife.com takes you right
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  to the supplements and
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  we have the new Chillforce that goes with
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  Brainforce. Brainforce is a whole bunch
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  of known healthy compounds that give you clean,
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  focused, sustained,
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  long-term energy
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  and even our enemies take it and go
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  well it did make me focus more and
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  work a lot better and longer than Espresso.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  Yeah. Yeah.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  I mean 4 Espresso's
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  is what Brainforce cost at Starbucks.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  This is 30 Espresso's plus.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  We're introducing
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Chillforce ladies and gentlemen
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  that doesn't make you, it's not
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  the present.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  It stacks with this
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  and focuses it even more
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  it depends on the person
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  it also helps you when you've been on a bunch
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  of natural stimulants to
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  stay awake but come off of them.
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  So it does both. It stacks and it's good to come
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  off of and you can sleep right on it
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  but it doesn't make you sleepy like knockouts
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  designed to knock you out. Take a couple of those.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  It's eight known Mother Nature
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  ingredients that do it, period proven.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  They go, oh supplements of scamp, oh yeah, melaton's

[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  you know it scientifically does it.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  They can't stand it.
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  So it's 50% off your Brainforce Plus

[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  or
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  last day, last last show I'm doing.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  We are selling out of the Carnivore 90
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  next level
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  enzyme, 17 plus dollars it cost us just
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  a bottle. That's free because I want you

[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  50% off till it sells out.
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  That's what I've said I'm going to do.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  But you don't get the free bottle of Carnivore.
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  We're down to like 300 bottles of that right now.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  It'll be gone by Sunday so if you want that
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  98% reviews on both those

[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  or AAA-253-3139.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  Okay, I'm done plugging. Thank you for the support.
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  Please support our local AM and FM stations
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  and TV stations as well with your word of mouth
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  tied to the truth I say
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  is your church exposing
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  post-birth abortion? Is your church exposing
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  the market of the beast world government being announced? Is it exposing the giant
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  pedophile rings? Is it exposing
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  the satanic agenda? No.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  They're there intimidated by Buddha judge
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  to just worship
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  pedophile
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  story time. So I say
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  tie to your local stations
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  or just sign the whole world over
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  to hell. Tom Papert manages one of
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  those great TV stations we're on where we went from
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  almost no ratings on that particular channel
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  you gave us to number one.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  Tell folks about that and then let's get
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  into what you call the state of the world
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  good versus evil the next time we're into
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  the whole you an invasion
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  and the latest huge developments there. Well it's always
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  a pleasure to be on Alex and one of the real
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  things that I'm excited about is we kind of
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  help start info wars TV
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  I don't know if that's even what you call it anymore. I know you're expanding
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  every single day but this is
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  an over the air broadcast network with all the
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  info wars programing David Knight
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  Alex Jones, Owen Schroyer,
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  you were one of the first stations to pick it up.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  Right I kind of talked to you guys into it I said
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  wait you've got a signal with everything on there and it repeats
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  the Alex Jones show why isn't this all over the country
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  so it's a phenomenal way for the satellite.
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  Exactly it's a phenomenal way
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  to support the broadcast because you're not
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  you don't have to go through Facebook you don't have to go through
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Twitter you don't have to find one of these pirate pages
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  that nobody knows about that's still streaming the broadcast
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  you can watch it on your TV with an antenna
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  and the best thing you can do is
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  reach out if you don't have it in your market
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  reach out to local TV stations
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  folks who are patriots more often
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  than not and tell them look this is
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  out there you need to pick this up it will be
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  the most popular channel in your market
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  tell folks about your station and then other stations
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  are fighting to get it it's it's been in the news there
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  absolutely so we're KCTU
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  TV5 in Wichita, Kansas
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  cover about 750,000 people
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  give or take a few households and
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  it has absolutely skyrocketed
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  we're a local TV station so you've got
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  movies you've got news you've got sports you've got
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  all kinds of stuff but let me tell you when there's
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  a bump in the night when there's a power surge
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  when there's something bad that happens it's not
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  anybody asking about the movie network
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  and I love the movie network it's a great movie network
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  but it is hundreds and hundreds
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  of calls what happened to Alex you're not taking
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  them off what happened to Alex where's Alex Jones I need
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  my info wars you're not getting rid of info wars
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  it is completely unbelievable
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  not only that people are loving it people
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  support it people they do
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  tithe to the TV station they do
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  support the advertisers
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  advertisers get calls
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  from individual viewers
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  saying this is amazing I can't believe it's
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  over the air thank you
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  the great part about digital TV now is it doesn't watch
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  you you watch it there's no surveillance
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  and a lot of these stations have 10-15 channels
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  you've got a bunch on digital sub
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  carriers where stations are now hundreds are
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  down doing it pick up info wars
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  24 hours a day and they're getting
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  huge response and like you said
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  we went on cloud TV went to number
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  one we're still on there we went to number one
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  on Roku they banned it we are
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  we're being banned because we're number one that's exactly
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  right they wouldn't hate you if you weren't effective
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  I mean again Joe Rogan's podcast biggest
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  he ever did he admits now is my last interview
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  number one so
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  I mean number one by a wide
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  margin that's what people don't understand or maybe
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  they do but this broadcast is the
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  single most important broadcast I believe
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  that's currently ongoing I mean you can look
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  at some of the other talk radio guys they're not doing
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  this well Tucker Carlson's slicker and
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  and just as smart or smarter and it does
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  an overall one-hour better job so he's
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  the best thing there is I think overall
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  for just absolute
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  Americana reboot the country dead on
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  can't disagree but for just
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  firepower it's it's info wars I love
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  that because I do love Tucker and he is fighting
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  every single day of his life with Fox news he is
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  not his producers the Fox news producers
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  who shut him down every single day of his life
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  and I love Tucker he does a fantastic job
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  but that's the one thing you don't have to worry about
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  all the backstory if I told you the backstory
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  or yes you know about I know some of it well it's
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  incredible I mean I'm not going to get into
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  it but he just is like it's it's I mean
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  it's World War three over there oh my god
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  it's I'm not going to say it
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  I just I can't I'm not supposed to
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  so I just well and I can say that I know
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  I've had stories that were going to get
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  picked up by Tucker Carlson and they say
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  no the producer didn't like it doesn't happen
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  with Alex Jones well it's beyond
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  that I mean it's
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  it hasn't
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  hasn't come out but I mean if I've done
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  this for a good year and no one knows
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  this so I'm not going to say it
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  hold it right back stay with us
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  it's been a year
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  since info wars and our other
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  channels were completely banned off of
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  YouTube we had over five billion views
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  when we got banned and we're credited with getting
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  Donald Trump elected because we were able
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  to punch through and reach the grassroots
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  now as we enter the 2020 election
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  cycle it's more important than ever that
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  there be a place where the sensors are
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  unable to block the signal
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  and it's now here banned
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  video
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  video is the answer for libertarians

[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  I say this at every single speech
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  it doesn't make any sense
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  for us to be committing
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  these kind of human rights
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  violations to have
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  these policies
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  in the way that we interact
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  with migrants
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  and asylum seekers
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  if
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  we want to continue
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  to be the kind of country
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  that condenses
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  countries in Africa
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  or Asia
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  or Latin American countries
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  for its treatment of refugees
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  and asylum seekers
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  so we should do
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  what any other country does
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  by dealing with this situation
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  in a serious way
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  so we have to
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  bring in the United Nations
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  High Commissioner on refugees
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  an agency
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  that has the expertise
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  and the training
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  to handle massive
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  flows of refugees
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  humanely
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  now that's Ilhan
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  Omar
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  as you know last week
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  and I made the point
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  the media is like how outrageous
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  she says bring the UN to run our borders
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  countries that have signed on
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  which is the majority
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  to UNESCO and the UN treaties
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  like George Herbert
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Walker Bush did in 92
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  Congress never ratified it
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  but still we were following it
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  and we were following the UN
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  refugee policy since 92
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  that not Congress, not the State Department
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  not the Border Patrol
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  not customs
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  that would decide who could come here
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  and that's why you wonder
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  why you go to Minnesota and it looks like Somalia
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  and the people are not
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  integrating, they say in interviews
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  they don't want to be there
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  and they say that they're going to turn America into surreal law
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  because in Islam
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  once they come into a country
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  they always end up pushing everyone out
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  a thousand years ago
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  India was more than
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  twice its size now
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  it went all the way into China
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  and Kashmir all the way
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  into part of Asia Minor
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  that's the Middle East boys and girls
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  and
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  the Muslims came in and took most of it
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  and killed all the Hindus and Buddhists
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  because Hindus and Buddhists will let you be a Christian
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  or a Muslim just like Christians will
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  not the Muslims
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  that's the thing
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  and see they play good cop, bad cop
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  so
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  now this week the head of the UN
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  Global Communications
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Paul Joseph Watson article
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  says
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  that illegally entering the US
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  is a right
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  you can go read her statements
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  where she says
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  it's never a crime
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  to seek asylum in another country
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  but see they just come in
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  so
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  if one enters the country irregularly
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  even if one enters it irregularly
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  that means illegally breaching it
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  the UN is saying
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  it's a criminal group created by the Rockefellers
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  the Absorb nation states
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  that it's going to come in
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  and that it's going to take over
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  and that we've got to submit to it
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  now let me roll you some video
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  from South Africa this week
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  of people being burned with gasoline
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  and being necklaced with
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  tires put over their heads with gasoline
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  something pioneered by Winnie Mandela
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  who bragged that she personally burned
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  over a thousand black people
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  to death
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  the ANC
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  waged war on at least four tribes
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  including the Zulus
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  by the way the ANC
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  represents people in South Africa
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  that invaded in the last hundred years
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  from
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  Central Africa
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  only the Zulus were there
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  well now the ANC
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  has learned though that when more migrants come in
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  for the rest of Africa
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  what they do is pour gasoline on them
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  and kill them we put up a map of South Africa
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  and you'll see Zulus land
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  that's the only place Zulus
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  who are like
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  the Comanches of Africa
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  the big tall tough guys
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  Zulus all over Africa that's the tough guys
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  everybody's afraid of them
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  well that matter when ten times the number comes
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  and they start killing the Zulus
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  so let's put a map of South Africa
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  stop South Africa and blow it up
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  you'll see Zulus land
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  one little area the Zulus get
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  now my point is that's a part type
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  of Zulus land
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  from outside
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  of Africa
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  of South Africa and you're black
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  they burn you and kill you in the street
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  not the Zulus but the ANC
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  Communist
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Tom Papert this is the UN agenda
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  bring in these tribal groups
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  bring them in that don't assimilate
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  and let them take over
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  that's exactly right and it's the 100%
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  tried and tested way to destroy civilization
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  we've seen it across time
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  the intelligent part of this
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  because they're doing this intentionally
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  it's not by accident that we have the UN
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  trying to destroy western countries
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  it's not by accident that we have them
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  doing this exclusively in countries that were
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  settled by high intelligence individuals
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  they're doing it because they want it to collapse
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  so they can then get even more
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  direct control and we know that they
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  ultimately want us all dead
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  they want to kill off 90% of the human population
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  they do it by stabilizing it first
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  then there's war, there's famine, there's everything else
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  and then boom they have the solution
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  they know how to fix everything so
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  then they and their families
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  get to live in the shambles
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  that they've created the planet is dying
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  but they're happy and they have money
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  you know they've got epigenetics
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  which has proven instincts compressed
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  that our ancestors pass on to us genetically
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  it's been proven it's in all advanced life
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  but it's even in birds, lizards
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  they all have it, fish have it
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  well that's why
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  honestly it shows so much black on black crime happens
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  because there's the ancestral memory
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  of tribal warfare in Africa
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  why do you think whites statistically kill more whites
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  it's not just our proximity to each other
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  there is a genetic memory
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  of that and that's what
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  the globalists know about, they're trying to manipulate
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  now you're exactly right on that
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  and they know also that there have been clashes
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  of culture since the beginning of time, look at the Roman spell
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  they start bringing in all of these tribes
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  that were not genetically similar
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  there are clashes, they eventually they will not
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  adopt to the government, they will not acclimate to the culture
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  and it falls and that's what we're seeing now
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  and it's no coincidence as you said
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  that you see places like Little Somalia
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  or should I say Minnesota where they bring in these people
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  and before you know it the place is totally unrecognizable
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  they're electing people who look like them
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  and think like them and talk like them
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  now that's the beautiful part though right
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  because Elan Omar she's a grifter
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  she doesn't think like they do
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  she cheats on her husband allegedly
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  she does all these incredibly crooked things
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  so they can't even get that right, the globalists
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  I mean there's one thing as you are continually proven right
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  and this is just how terrible of liars these people are
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  and how sick they are
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  and going further looking at this
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  we're told we're bad in the west
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  but we're supposed to then let everybody
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  into our nations
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  well wait, why have you
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  go somewhere like Rwanda
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  where the small Christian tribe
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  that only got Christianized
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  in the last 400 years
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  ended up having 90 plus percent of the wealth
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  and then the UN
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  and then the UN and the globalists came in
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  because they wanted the people that had all the land in control
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  and they killed the Christian minority
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  with the animist
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  or earth worship group
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  that was 90%
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  now that's what really happened there
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  it's all been admitted
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  why would Christians suddenly be able
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  who were black to get along with each other
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  and build incredible wealth
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  Western Europe was barbarous
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  and people were living in huts and caves
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  basically and killing each other
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  until Christianity came
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  so Europeans had very high IQs
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  you could say
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  but we're still living just like sabbages anywhere else
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Christianity is whether you're black or white
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  is what will unify you
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  in the system
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  and that will produce the productivity
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  and success of Christ's
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  vision and that's why the globalists
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  want to get rid of it because they want tribalism
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  they want to control all of us
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  with divide and conquer
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  you're exactly right, in fact that's one of the things
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  they do mission trips to Tanzania
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  they've baptized like 25,000 Christians
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  in the last six, seven, eight years
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  it's absolutely unbelievable what they accomplish down there
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  and in the areas where you now have
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  Lutheran Christians
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  the violence is disappearing
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  the sectarian violence, the group, the Muslim
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  against the Christian, against the animist
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  it's totally going away, it's evaporating
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  there's prosperity there, but they're under attack
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  they come from other parts of Tanzania
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  and they literally attack these Christians
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  because they don't like this vision of Christ
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  they don't like prosperity
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  they want it to continue to be a UN sponsored hellhole
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  again, the answer is Christ
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  not the fake mega churches
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  but Christ, and I'm not here selling Christ
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  because I'm being paid to do it folks
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  they hate me because I do it
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  but I'm telling you, it's the only thing that works
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  and I'm not up here saying I'm perfect
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  I'm not up here lecturing you how moral
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  I am, but when it comes to standing up against evil
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  when it comes to trying to defend the unborn
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  when it comes to believing in America
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  these churches
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  tell you how moral they are all day
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  and I guarantee you those preachers aren't

[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  and stand up and tell you how good they are

[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Turkey says if they don't let
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Turkey set up political parties in Europe
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  to then take over Europe
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  they will unleash millions more
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  invaders into
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Europe
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Turkey threatens to flood Europe
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  with migrants holding them
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  hostage Erdogan calls upon
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  Western nations to fund the
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000]  reparation of millions of Syrian refugees
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  he plans to resettle in a safe zone
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  if not he will ship them
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  into Europe
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  this is the plan this is how they operate
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  this is us being held hostage
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  absolutely right and they've done this before
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  every single time Turkey wants something
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000]  they say hey we've got these millions of refugees
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  and if you don't give us exactly what we want
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  they're going into Europe
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  and really this is the dumbest
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  it's not even dumb it's all planned
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  they know what they're doing and the problem is
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]  now you've got a few countries in Europe
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Central and Eastern Europe that are starting to fight back
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  but this was all by design
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  they want Turkey to be a member of the EU
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  they want Turkey to be able to do whatever it wants
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  and Turkey is loving all this political power
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  it's got I mean you've got a guy there
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  who's basically a dictator and he is using
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  his position to hold Europe
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  by the short and curlies to do whatever they want
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  it might as well just be claimed as Turkey
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  the middle ages are back Alex
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  it is all Turkey now
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  the Ottoman Empire
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  and the UN thinks they can control
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  1.8 billion Muslims
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  set to be 3 billion
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  6 kids on average
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  in just 11 years
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  and they're preparing
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  to use the autocratic central system of Islam
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  merge with a communist corporate fascist system
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  to control the entire planet
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  this is just unbelievable
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  evil it is well and you know as well as I do
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  that it's going to result in
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  very dangerous things
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  we don't want violence but it's going to result in violence
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  that's what we're fighting
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  I'm not living under godless Sharia law
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  with a bunch of leftist minders
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  running around with their machine guns pissing on us
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  because they're all over the news
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  they're all over Yahoo this morning
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  hundreds of comments I read saying we want to kill Alex Jones
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  we can't wait to put him in a torture camp
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  all these people that can't even work a job
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  are fantasizing how they're going to be the guards
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  they'll never be the guards
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  but they're going to bring that in
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  and I want to assure them
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  this is Sparta
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  and there are still people like that left
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  and you will pay when you make that move

[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  you understand that?
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000]  that's exactly right I mean there is a very famous twitter exchange a few years ago
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  where they're literally saying
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  what will you do when the red army takes over
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  and we institute full Islamist communism
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  and they're all morons

[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  From the front lines of the information war
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  it's Alex Jones
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  Larry Grant walked out a few years ago
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  he had his daughter on
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  he was a highly decorated green beret in Vietnam
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  going to mainline college, they tried to recruit him
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  this was the weatherman, they said
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  we're going to put 50 million people in camps
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  mainly white conservative men
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  we're going to kill them
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  and we're going to put their families in forced labor
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  that came out in federal court
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  well now you can go to Yahoo today
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  in an article against me
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  a third of the comments, I read hundreds of them
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  there's like 2,500 comments that I saw this morning
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  I couldn't read them all, but I read a few hundred
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  and it was like we're going to kill him
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  we're going to put him in a forced camp
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  I can't wait for the communist takeover
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  this is what they're teaching at the colleges
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  anti-fight is mainline
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  that's why mainstream media promotion is good
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  Tom, you've probably seen this
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  viral leftist fantasizing about
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  the people they were saying they were going to do
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  it's absolutely insane, it's either on Twitter or Tumblr
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  and we posted it here recently on my Facebook page
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  but what they're saying is the first guy says
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  so what are you going to do when the communists take over
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  and we finally win
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]  and somebody says, oh great question
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  I'm going to be in uniform design
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  and procurement for the red army
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  and another guy comes in and says, that's a fascinating thought
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  I think I will treat
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]  capitalists who have PTSD
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  in the gulags, that's what I'm going to do
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  and it goes on like this for 4 or 5 posts
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  these people are absolutely delusional
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  they're going to be, if they're lucky
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  a dirt farmer somewhere struggling to exist
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  and I remember it, I remember it because
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  it was real people
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  they're in this article I saw today
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  in the comics fantasizing about the same stuff
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  right, no this is a real thing, these people are so deluded
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  this would be like if you and I are sitting there
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  when we get back to 1776
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  I'm going to open a plantation
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  I mean that's nuts, that's not realistic
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  but that's what these people are
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  this is what the world is today
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  with just on time delivery and all these systems
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]  you destabilize it, it'll fall apart
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  if we don't have 2.2 children
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  all the algorithms show we're going to have societal collapse already
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  and the globalists are already gearing it
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  for a civilizational collapse
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  which they're going to be separate from
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  in armored cities, they're already building
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  and these idiots don't know, the plan is to
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  remove all them, that's at the academic level
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]  they believe they're bringing in a communist revolution
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  the globalists have literally
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  set them up to destabilize
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  and bring down a pro-human civilization
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  that's exactly right and we all know
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  that the globalists will be taken care of
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  they've got the black helicopters, they're going to go to their little
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000]  as you say the fortified cities
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  it's these moronic communists
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  who if they start a civil war and god hope
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  we don't get there, you and I are fighting
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  every single day of our lives to avoid that
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  but if we get there and they win, they're the next to go
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  by the way, this isn't hyperbole
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  I first reported this
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  12, 13 years ago now
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  when I was meeting with a major producer in Hollywood
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  and he had just been meeting with James Cameron
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  and James Cameron
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  was basically saying I don't even care about movies anymore
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000]  I'm not going to try to put out hologram movie theaters
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  like I was, I'm moving to New Zealand
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  I've got these ships that I claim
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  are looking for wrecks but that's just the tax write off
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  that's in case even New Zealand falls
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  I've got my own fleet
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  there's a nuclear war, a bio weapons release
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  because he's been told get ready for that
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]  it's coming, this extinction event
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  well now that's mainstream news that they're all running to New Zealand
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  Kauai, Hawaii
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  and Tasmania, Australia
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  that's in New York Times, Washington Post
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  this is real folks, they're trying to
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  gear a worldwide collapse
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  from which we basically kill ourselves
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  and then they return
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  it's psychotic
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  really they built a system that's not sustainable
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  that's going to collapse so they've just tried to spin golly it
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  and then claim they really manage the whole thing
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  right, no that's exactly right
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  this is their solution and it's all around the world
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  they have these little bug out zones, Iceland is one of them
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  and Switzerland is one of them, these isolated areas
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  for some reason they don't have
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  multiculturalism in all of these immigrants
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  who come from completely antithetical cultures
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  they don't have all of these high taxes
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  and insane policies that we have here in the west
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]  but they're in the west
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  it's because that's where Kim Jong Un goes to school
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  that's where all of these great families
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  the Rockefellers go to school
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  they jump in back and forth, that's what globalism is
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  it's corporate crony capitalism
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  using communism and fascism
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  this is all in Carol Quigley's book
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  Bill Clinton's mentor, 1100 pages
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  go and tell it
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  go read it folks, it's written by them
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  head of Georgetown political science
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  and they set up the communist dictatorships
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  use all the slave labor
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  the generals all become billionaires
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  westerners that put them in power become billionaires
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  have total control, use all the slave goods
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  to leverage out and take over the west
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  industry as well
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  in economic warfare and then they're offshore
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  based in Ireland mainly
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  and are totally tax exempt and all pay zero
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  while they lobby for you the middle class
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  making it 60, 70
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  100,000, 200,000 dollars a year
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  that you're rich, not paying your fair share
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]  at 40% federal alone
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  on average paying 65% in taxes
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  most of which is siphoned off
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]  to Warren Buffett who got in one bailout
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  487 billion
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  for his own company
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  type in Warren Buffett, biggest recipient
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  of 2008 bailout
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  while he lectures you that there should be higher taxes
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000]  and he's not paying enough when he got the laws
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  written where he basically pays no tax
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  and he says he's willing to pay more tax
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  yeah prove it buddy the IRS has a donation window
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  go ahead and chuck all your money in there
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  it'll be great oh it's all a stunt
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  he's a total eugenicist predator
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  absolutely no you're totally right and for people who don't believe this
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  this is already happening around the world
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  I mean look at South America where it's on a micro scale
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  the people at the top 1%
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  of these failed countries down there
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  that have totally fallen to communism
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  they're still living great, they've still got food
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  they've got palatial estates with guards
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  and finst off
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  they're buying the caviar
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  right that's exactly right meanwhile
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  they've already eaten the zoo animals
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  they don't know what else to eat
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  they're sifting through the garbage hoping to find a rat
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  so they can have dinner
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  they ate the zoo animals 6 years ago in
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  Venezuela
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  and now thousands are dying a week from starvation
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  but don't worry the government made a law saying you can't report it
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  that's right there's a law saying you can't report it
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  and here in the west the number one thing is
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  well that's not real communism
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  that's state capitalism
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  pepper the last piece of the question that you obviously already know
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  but the audience knows this too but we've got to warn people
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  then they send in Bernie Sanders
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  allowing him to swindle and take over universities
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  and implode them huge million dollar houses
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  everywhere 118,000 dollar
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  cars, caviar, private jets
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  but he'll do photo ops flying coach
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  I mean this is a criminal
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  conscious slug
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  a predator with just hate for you and your family
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  went to have his honeymoon
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  in the Soviet Union where he could literally go
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  and visit gulags and piss on Christians
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]  and I mean this is a
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  monster who has will
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  to destroy you
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  they didn't send him in with Elizabeth Warren
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  all this other scum and Buddha judge
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  to promise you all this free stuff
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  while the globalists are offshore tax exempt
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  and then you vote for free stuff
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  it implodes everything, you get nothing
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  and then never even know what hit you
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  and then he runs to Switzerland
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  that's exactly right, you nailed it right there
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  and they're trying to do this worldwide
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  again except for their special isolated zones
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  totally immune to all of this
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]  they don't have any of this coming up
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  but that's exactly the plan, they want to destroy America
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  so they can rebuild it in their own image
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  which is essentially hell
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  let's be clear, Kim Jong-il all of them
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  they send their kids to the finest places in Switzerland
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  they jet out and live in the richest areas
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  they're not even in their country at the time
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  and they enjoy strutting by
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  and seeing starving people
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  that are literally living on 600 calories a day
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  there's no birds, there's no bugs
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]  everything's been eaten
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]  they could live off the incredible wealth of setting people free
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  but they don't care, they want to see them
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  starving and begging with the satanic energy
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  sucking off of them
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  meanwhile South Korea got a little bit of freedom
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  richest country per capita in the world
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  total wealth, less physical resources
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  but you see the real resource
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  of the Satanist is draining
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  the spiritual energy
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  and the pain of the Korean people
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  that's the feast
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  North Korea is a rich kingdom
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  of vampires
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  there was one of the big democrats
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  Ed Buck, he actually one of his accusers said
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  when he was being allegedly
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  drug-raped
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  all the stuff Ed Buck does to these people
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  massive friend of the Clintons
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  he actually said that Ed Buck feeds off the energy
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  of sucking black people dry
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  that's what the accuser said, it's exactly what you're talking about
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  he would come and make them overdose
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  he's been arrested over and over again
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  a bunch of people died at his house
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  they died at his apartment and then he drags them outside
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  well there's something about black people
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  when the Joneses came out
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  sacrificed a black kid at their house in New York
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  it's very hard to find it but it was in the 70s
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  dead kid at their house
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  they've really tried to expunge it
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  but the point is
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  there's a favorite of Satanist is killing black kids
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  and they like to kill all kids
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  little girls especially
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  but they love to kill black kids and drink their blood
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  that's exactly right and it's all admitted now
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  this is the crazy thing, another example of where Alex Jones has been proven right
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  this is something that was totally out of left field
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  when you first said it five or six years ago
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  you read Ed Bucks accuser saying
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  yes, he would drug me
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  he would suck my energy out
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  he wants to watch me die
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  that's what makes him happy
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  that's what the accuser says
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  all people die at his house
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  that's what he does
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  and that's what the accusers say
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  but soon, you'll need a plan and place
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  to survive
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  you need survivalist camps
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  the ultimate fully functional
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.080]  Trust your family survival to survivorscamps.com.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480]  the world.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.480]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:42.440]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.240]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.240]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.800]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.720]  The deep state began with World War I.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:57.560]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.400]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:03.960]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960]  by you.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.200]  But the symptoms are there.

[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.280]  across America.

[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.920]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.760]  elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.360]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.120]  where the censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here.

[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:27.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:57.480]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.240]  over the government.
[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:03.320]  The reply was establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:07.640]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate that
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.840]  are die-hard capitalists?
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:12.720]  The reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:19.440]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:26.560]  from Columbia, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million
[01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.560]  people.
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:31.000]  And they were dead serious.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.440]  And then I was on Yahoo this morning, and I may do a special report on this just to
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.440]  show it all.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.880]  And I spent like 20, 30 minutes scanning, because it was like a third of the comments
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.160]  were, we want to get him on a camp.
[01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.960]  I can't wait to torture him to death.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.360]  Once we take over, we're going to kill him all, and they'll be like, oh, yes, oh, yes,
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.600]  you're not going to do jack crap.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.600]  You understand?
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:52.400]  I don't need to feel like a man to tell you that I can kill your ass if I want to, if
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.560]  you try to kill me.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.840]  I want you to wake up and come out of your sickness, but they're satanic.
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.400]  They get off on killing babies.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.160]  They want to kill babies after they're born.
[01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.160]  They're harvesting their organs.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.560]  I told everybody this.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.760]  Now seven states have passed laws to keep him alive and do it.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:10.600]  I had a nurse in my house a few months ago, an RN, I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:15.760]  It was a friend of the family, let's just say distant family of family.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:18.400]  And I was bringing this up to her, and she goes, actually, I know about that in the wing
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.920]  next door.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.440]  They put them in oxygen tents, but I said, but they're alive babies, right?
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.760]  And she's like, well, yeah, but I said, yeah.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:31.600]  So if the doctor says they're going to resuscitate at birth, they say it's a living baby.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.760]  But if they don't resuscitate, it's still alive.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.760]  It's legalese.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.760]  They keep it alive and kill it.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:41.560]  And she started shaking, shaking, okay, and almost pissed on herself because it was someone,
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.880]  see the Stockholm syndrome?
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.520]  You're involved and no next door, they're keeping babies alive and killing them.
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.520]  And she said adults too.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.000]  And I said, yeah, and people that have been in car wrecks and stuff.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.960]  And I said, and some of them aren't brain dead, are they?
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:58.720]  And she starts shaking because these people by increment have become part of the crime.
[01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.040]  And then they're in the middle of it.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.960]  And then when they're confronted with it and have that conscious thought, they don't know
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.960]  what to do.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:09.240]  So the governor has to come out and go, we keep baby after they're born alive, we keep
[01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.240]  them comfortable.
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.880]  And we, well, why are you keeping comfortable because they're harvesting them.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:18.760]  Well, and you notice, I mean, going back to that Ralph Northam that I held break, that
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:23.880]  was totally amazing insanity that we were seeing coming out of that horrible, horrible
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.880]  man.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:28.600]  But it was interesting that he said he did not use the word doctor once in that interview.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600]  It's a provider.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.200]  I mean, they, they, they dress it up in such colorful language and what it does is it hides
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200]  the lie.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.200]  It's exactly what you're talking about.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:37.680]  It's their big, beautiful lie.
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.680]  They're not baby killers.
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.440]  They're not killing babies already born.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.440]  The providers.
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.880]  Yeah, they're providing for the world.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.200]  They're providing for the mother.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.560]  They're providing for the dead baby.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:49.280]  But what he's talking about, fundamentally, I don't like to dress it up.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.800]  They pull the baby out of the uterus.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.960]  They keep it alive right up until the point where they shove an ice pick in his brain at
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.240]  the base of its skull and kill it.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.240]  That's what this is.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.160]  And there's more people wanting to adopt each year than there are abortions.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160]  Right.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.640]  Meanwhile, Buddha judge says Christians hate babies.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.600]  No, it's Christians that adopt all the babies.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.120]  It's Christians that built the damn country.
[01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:08.480]  You little weak chicken neck trader.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.600]  We've got Buddha judge saying that, then you have Bernie saying to kill brown babies.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.400]  I mean, this is what these people are like.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:17.920]  Why do you think they're totally coming out of the closet now with their Satanism, their
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.920]  anti-human garbage?
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.080]  Honestly, Alex, you're part of the reason.
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:24.200]  You're part of the reason this whole big populist movement is part of the reason because
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.560]  people are calling them on their crap.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.280]  And when that happens, they have two choices.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.120]  One, they can either deny it or two, they can normalize it.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120]  So what's coming next?
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:36.640]  Because I want to get into how you see this unfolding.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.440]  Do you agree with me that we're at a major crossroads right now?
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.440]  Absolutely.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:41.680]  And we are at that major crossroads.
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.720]  And it totally depends, I mean, I love President Trump.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.160]  I think he's doing wonderful things, but he needs to double down on the road that he is
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.280]  traveling and not be led astray by family members by whatever it is.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.280]  Because that's what it comes down to.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:57.960]  We can either continue down this road and we can unleash a new era of American prosperity
[01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.360]  or as many, many empires have throughout history, we can fall in the extermination.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.080]  And the globalists admit they know that.
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:09.040]  And the CFR, that's the internationalist, literal British empire traders, I'm not blaming
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  the British.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:15.880]  It's the same governing globalist empire corporate system that use the UK's power to take over
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.760]  much the world.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.920]  It is now saying the American centuries over, the Chai Comm centuries here, and they're
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.920]  trying to get America to commit suicide.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.880]  And Trump is saying no, we're saying no.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.080]  And so yes, Trump's light years better than Hillary and we're glad he's there.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:38.280]  But we're two days in to the Washington Post article that he's looking at red flag computers
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:43.800]  using iPhones and Apple Watches and droids and home assistants that are already listening
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:50.000]  to you to tell if they think your suicidal are going to hurt somebody by little micro
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.960]  things of your voice and things.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:57.000]  No judge, no jury, no due process, your guns are then taken and many other things.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.080]  When we come back, they're not just promoting in the news that all your home assistants are
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:07.360]  listening to you and that courts are indeed coming in and using, going and saying give
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.760]  us a month, give us a year and it's all recorded.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:10.960]  Of course it is.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.760]  And humans are listening to it at the companies.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.920]  Now they're doing it to video games.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.160]  Now, oh, that's right.
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:19.200]  You didn't know that video games are all recorded.
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.200]  You did.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200]  Oh, we're going to cover that.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.200]  We come back.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.360]  What you're saying during video games, what you're doing on the phone, everything's been
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.800]  recorded for at least 10 years.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.800]  All of it saved.
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.840]  Well, and it's no, it's no surprise.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:35.920]  I mean, what you see them doing video games now, they ban your language in real time as
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.920]  you say it.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.040]  So if you say a naughty word that you're not allowed to say, definitely not on broadcast,
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:43.880]  but not on Facebook, not on Twitter, not on the AI stops it before it goes out.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:44.880]  That's exactly right.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:48.480]  And you get the chains are on folks.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:52.040]  And now they want to announce it to you that they're on, but they're go, who they might
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.600]  struggle if we let them know they're like, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.600]  Let them know.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.600]  We've changed them on that.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.000]  It's all for our greater good.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.720]  It's all because we need to do this to stop the next mass shooter.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.000]  We will monitor the video games who will monitor your home.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000]  We'll listen.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  We'll have the Alexa listening to you sleep.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.400]  And if your heart starts beating too fast, we'll have a pharmaceutical guy come on in
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.480]  and give you whatever drug you need.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:12.280]  This is all in the white papers.
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.680]  It's all on national file.com.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.080]  It's all on info words.com.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.160]  They want us to know this.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.160]  They are normalizing.
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.240]  It's the same reason three years ago, we had stories of people saying they're not a monster.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.360]  They're a pedophile and they're a virtuous pedophile.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:26.840]  And now they have a word called map, which is something along the lines of a pedophile
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.720]  that is just a minor attracted person.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.360]  They're trying to get us used to this stuff.
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.320]  So when it all comes out, we will accept it.
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.320]  And that's exactly.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.840]  They're teaching us not to stand up for ourselves for the rise of the cyborg takeover and the
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]  post human world.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.440]  And they're announcing it and they're telling it to us.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.360]  And that's all that matters, folks, is you take hold of your humanity and God and your
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.240]  family and you stand against it and you let them know that you're aware of what they're
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.840]  doing and you raise the alarm and they will be defeated.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.640]  But it's going to be a long, hard fight.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.080]  This is the Bible tells us.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.760]  But in the end, we will prevail, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.960]  We will stop the pedophile armies together.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:08.080]  We will stop all the followers that signed on to Satanism, believing they would be given
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.160]  power in the earth when all they're going to be given is enslavement.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back to one more segment with Tom Papert.

[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]  break down.

[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:17.480]  L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:22.480]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:27.040]  GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including

[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:45.040]  against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:33:10.800]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chilforce challenge at infowarslive.com.

[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.160]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:37.440]  What are the main costs of entry into the world government and the anti-human system
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:41.160]  is that you hate infowars and despise or truly.
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.600]  I am extremely proud of that.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.440]  I'm probably more proud of that than really anything other than my children.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:48.440]  And I'm very thankful for that.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:54.400]  To have the enemy of humanity, to have the God forsaken satanic globalist, said that
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.240]  my name is rebote and that my website is rebote and that I'm the most hated enemy.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.880]  Even more than Trump is a real blessing.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.800]  It's because we have the sickening demons number and we're calling them out and we're
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.440]  not scared of them and they can't stand that.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.160]  I'm only scared of what I want to do to them that would keep me from my larger mission
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:18.040]  of being peaceful and awakening folks.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:23.160]  But watching these snakes slither around and feed on children and others is very hard to
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:24.160]  watch.
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:27.920]  But I'll sit back and watch it and then I'll do everything I can to stop them.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:34.320]  Now you can type in anywhere, home assistants are listening to you recording everything
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.520]  for years and giving it to the police.
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.000]  And of course you see where Amazon and you see where Google and all these companies just
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000]  turn everything over.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.080]  You go, oh that sounds great except it's total dragnets and everything's being recorded
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:51.520]  and they tried to deny this years ago but I showed you the terms of service for Samsung
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:58.680]  TVs and iPhones and everything and so now.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.680]  Here it is.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:04.040]  States to launch Google, Facebook, antitrust probes.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:07.720]  We told you that that was coming, they met a few months ago in Omaha, Nebraska and now
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.360]  they're moving but that's too little, too late.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360]  Exclusive.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360]  This is from Forbes.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  Oh it's exclusive.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:21.480]  Feds order Apple and Google to hand over the names of 10,000 users of a gun scope app.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:28.880]  Because it turns out that the Apple app and the Google app, it's on both, recorded everything
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:32.240]  you ever did on it.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:38.760]  When you aimed the rifle scope app at a deer or a building or your girlfriend joking, it
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:45.320]  all was recorded and now they're going to put your name and your internet ID, why not?
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.560]  I mean Apple's already based in China and gives them all the code keys to your every
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:49.560]  device.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.880]  Yeah, Chinese government is in your phone.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:56.720]  You worry about Apple hacks, Apple is the chai con.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.080]  So here it is, own a rifle, got a scope.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:05.720]  To go with it, the government might soon know who you are, where you live and how to reach
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:06.720]  you.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.920]  That's because Apple and Google have been ordered by the US government to hand over
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:13.320]  the names, phone numbers and other identifying data to at least 10,000 users of a single
[01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.280]  gun scope app.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:20.080]  Users discover in an unprecedented move, never before has a case been disclosed in which
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.800]  American investigators demanded personal data of users on a single app from Apple and Google
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:30.720]  and never has the order been made public where the feds have asked the Silicon Valley
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.520]  giant, this is the coming out, for info on so many thousands of people.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:39.080]  Court of the court order filed the Department of Justice on September 5th, investigators
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:45.520]  want information on users of Obsidian 4, a tool used to control rifle scopes made by
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:48.600]  Night Vision Specialist American Technologies Network Court.
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:53.400]  The app allows gun owners to get a live stream, take video and calibrate their gun scope
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:58.320]  from the Android iPhone device according to Google Play page Obsidian 4, it has been more
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.360]  than 10,000 downloads.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.760]  Apple doesn't provide the download numbers and it goes on to say it's a video recording
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.200]  over the app in their database of everything you videotaped.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:13.160]  So everyone that has the app, everyone that ever uploaded with it, it's all been given
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.080]  with all your personal data to the feds.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:20.360]  You like that?
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:26.800]  And they've got a decade at least of everything recorded, everything, not just samples.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:33.320]  And they switch on your phone when you're sitting there playing with your winky dink
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:38.720]  or you're having sex with your wife or you're doing business deals, it's all been recorded
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:44.480]  and text files have been made that are searchable and they've got all this power and all this
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.880]  criminality and all this stuff, they built it by design and now they're about to roll
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880]  it out for you.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:52.640]  They're about to tell the schmucks about it.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.080]  Who warned you 20 years ago?
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:02.680]  I told you specifically how it worked because NSA whistleblowers came to me, engineers, guys
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.960]  worth millions of dollars who had built the damn stuff.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:10.440]  It's all funny now, isn't it, huh?
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:14.360]  It's all cutesy footsie and you know what they use all these apps for to protect the
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.040]  kidnapped children, to protect themselves from getting caught.
[01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:23.080]  It's all about watching you and only the evil child molesters and devil worshippers are
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:27.560]  going to give them full access to all this so they can have a heads up on all of us and
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:32.920]  basically they believe they have an invincibility to carry out their criminal ops against you.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:33.920]  You going to do anything?
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.480]  You going to speak out against it or are you going to get scared and suck your thumb?
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.320]  Hell, a lot of people will probably join with it.
[01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.320]  A lot of folks are cowards, they think well I'll just join with it, I'll be safe, no
[01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:55.800]  you'll be destroyed because this craziness is going to run until billions are dead and
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.980]  we're going to have to worship the Robots that's all in the Bible and they're all announcing
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.400]  that they're going to have more rights than us and the Cyborgs and they're all going to
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:08.240]  say they're gods and it's all a big delusion and that it's all going to fall in one hour
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:15.920]  just like a computer would, it's going to go and then billions are going to starve to
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:23.520]  death and then any globalists hiding in their underground bases are going to be dug out,
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:29.720]  other holes. All of this will happen before this generation is dead. Watch it happen,
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:33.560]  Tom Pepper. You're exactly right. And it's one of the most terrifying things to think
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:36.960]  about, Alex, is how many people are just going along with this. This morning, I saw a headline.
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:42.800]  I'm not even sure where it's from, saying that the first ever instance of a robot hiring
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:48.080]  a human has just happened. As a robot with AI, did a bunch of interviews and hired somebody.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.360]  And there's so many people out there who think, you can't stop this. This is the future. This
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:55.600]  is wonderful. Let's just let's just sign on for it. This is great. Well, the government aren't
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:59.840]  this is something that I get far too often. The government already has my info. Who cares?
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.880]  Let them have more. Take the tape off my laptop. Let them listen to me on my phone. Let them know
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.440]  what exactly I'm watching on TV and what I'm saying to my wife. But it doesn't matter. They
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.080]  already know I give up and it's the most sickening attitude that I've seen in my life. And what it
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.120]  is is Stockholm syndrome. Why don't you show on your Facebook when you're going out of town what
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:23.920]  your address is and what you got? Because thieves use it to rob you. The predatory system is building
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.120]  a post human world. You're building your own destruction. They say it's being built to make
[01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:36.640]  you obsolete and extinct humans by this generation. NBC News. The plan is to kill you. They're already
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:41.200]  killing your fertility. They're already lowering your IQ so you can't fight. Yep. That's exactly
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:46.320]  right. Let me tell you, you're aware of this and ask God for guidance. Literally God comes in and
[01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.400]  it boosts your IQ. You don't have to be possessed by a demon and want to rape kids and think,
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:56.480]  wow, this is amazing. You can actually have God come into you. You want that? You Satanists don't
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.080]  understand anything and how powerful God is. You couldn't even handle it. Believe me.
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.440]  You're absolutely right. And that is the one saving grace, literally saving grace of our society,
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.440]  is that we have good people who are fighters, metaphorical, metaphysical fighters who are on
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.520]  the side of good. The Satanists, they don't have that. They have useful idiots. That's what they
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.480]  have. They have zombie slaves. That's what it comes down to. And meanwhile, I mean,
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.200]  they are so afraid. That's why, again, they've been normalizing everything. That's why we've had
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:31.920]  five years of, oh, how come there's an ad? I just mentioned that when I was changing clothes yesterday
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:35.200]  and all of a sudden it's on my phone. That's why they've been rolling this out slowly because
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:40.160]  they know that their goose is cooked metaphorically and it's only a matter of time until everybody
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.440]  is awake. Two weeks ago, I said, watch in the room. I said, let's talk about Fantasy Island.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.160]  And then a few days later, everybody goes, yeah, Fantasy Island popped up in my Yahoo feed,
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:52.960]  my Google feed on YouTube. I've never even talked about that in my life. And I'm like, yeah, look,
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.360]  it's all Fantasy Island. I was talking about it. Because we had a conversation about Fantasy Island.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.320]  Today, I was hiking with my wife and I said, watch. Okay. And the phone was off. And I said,
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.720]  watch. I'm going to say racist stuff. And you watch while we're hiking. The phone is going to
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.320]  boop and turn on. And I started saying it as a test. And she goes, oh, my God, it turned on.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:18.000]  It was going boop. And it was sending data. It was recording. And you're like, what? Again,
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:23.040]  folks, it's incredible. I did that as a test. Right. I was I showed her and she was like, oh,
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.800]  my God. No, you're exactly right. I was meeting with business partners this last weekend. And I
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:31.040]  made the Marty Robbins quote, communism, socialism, call it what you like. There's very little
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.320]  difference in the two. I go to YouTube. Some of the guys had never heard of some of them business
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:37.840]  partners. And they never heard. It's like, it's right there. The top search result. I've never
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:42.640]  listened to that song on a laptop before. But there it is. I mean, it's so obvious and on the nose
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.880]  what they're doing. But yet there's this little tiny paper thin and growing thinner by the day
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.200]  layer of them pretending that it's not happening. But again, we saw the document from Harpa where
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.960]  they say we're going to use your spit bit. We're going to use your they admit they're doing it.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:01.440]  The head of the CIA eight years ago. The environment on our skin. It's only natural

[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:09.840]  enough i mean i've been covering it some but look at these headlines red flag laws spur
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:16.880]  debate on due process and they've got all these ap reuters politico like yeah seven states have
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:23.440]  passed the laws and another you know 10 states are about to pass it and a whole bunch of other
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:29.360]  things have happened and everything and yeah we didn't really need due process anymore and yeah
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.120]  you don't even really make a threat we just take your guns it's just incredible how this is happening
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.680]  and then i have this article out of associated press it was right next to another article about
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:45.840]  me today on the front page uh that was total disinfo that i'd lost at appeal in the sandy hook
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:56.560]  thing no the austin judge just gave a one-sentence ruling we appealed it that we were going to
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:03.280]  challenge the lawsuit and the uh texas court said well we're passing that back down to the judge
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.520]  because it we don't have a jurisdiction the judge didn't create a ruling he didn't have a hearing
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.680]  because this judge is an admitted leftist who wants to crucify me and uh here in austin's
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:22.240]  has left us to san francisco and he is openly uh you're saying all of this so it wasn't a defeat
[01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:30.400]  their little fake trials they want to have are years away but they ran nationally that i lost
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:36.240]  sandy hook now it wasn't as bad as ap a few months ago and they said that i wrote a book called no
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:44.080]  one died at sandy hook and that i lost a suit for millions of dollars i never wrote that book
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:49.680]  professor fetzer did i never interviewed fetzer on the book i'm not in the book i later found out
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:55.840]  and i had lawyers contact ap and they said we don't care or the wall street journal they also
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:01.200]  ran it they said we don't care sue us because these big trillion dollar corporations that own them
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:06.480]  don't care they want to lie with impunity and create the illusion that we're all losing let me tell
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:12.880]  you what's happening states politicians back gunmaker and sandy hook appeal ap the same law firm
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:24.720]  suing me that's run by senator blumenthal the same group spending millions and millions and
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:33.040]  millions to try to bankrupt us the same group that lied and said i said child porn to the sandy
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:41.520]  hook families that's that's the group who sued remington our oldest firearm maker into bankruptcy
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:47.120]  because remington had corporate lawyers you know cost cough and cost cough spends five million on
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:54.160]  i spent 200 000 fighting but remington's lawyers the word is something like a hundred million dollars
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:59.040]  or something in a five-year battle with these guys oh yeah i mean this cost cough and cost cough is
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:04.640]  the devil incarnate i mean they're trying to they pick it right of the first amendment
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:12.000]  and the second and if the supreme court rules because they've had the rig courts in connecticut
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.800]  rule that remington is liable if someone uses their gun illegally think of the liability if
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:22.560]  someone uses a car illegally or a baseball bat illegally it's if you think lawyers have already
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:28.720]  wrecked america and already bankrupted us we can't do business and the supreme court's hearing it
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:36.320]  right now and the same law firm that sends five to ten lawyers to every hearing
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:44.480]  is saying all of this that's who we're up against that's who we're fighting
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:51.440]  that's who we're dealing with so i'm not a victim i'm a warrior for myself and my family and you
[01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:56.080]  and i'm fighting these people and we're exposing them that's why you got to fight harder and spread
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:01.680]  the word and pray and buy our products because when you do that we can stand against these people
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:05.920]  and they'll never be able to silence me you know they've got one of these lawyers that's a former
[01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:10.480]  state attorney that put the governor in prison in connecticut and what they keep trying to do is
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:15.120]  claim that i'm covering up evidence and doing all this crazy crap and the judge that's there in the
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:20.320]  case and goes we know you made money off send you give us all your secret documents they don't exist
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:25.360]  the judge says i'm throwing your case out i'm gonna go to summary judgment i know it's true
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:31.920]  what these dirty hillary people say i mean it's just sick but you've been watching and listening
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:36.320]  it's them that live off sandy hook it's them that talk about it constantly and sue remington
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.160]  out of existence and letting thousands of people lose their jobs in connecticut
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.920]  they're the bloodsuckers they're the democrats they're the big fat party of the perverts
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:55.520]  and they want to put me in prison they know they're gonna lose this is the supreme court
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:53:03.040]  it'll go on for years rig courts it'll die in the supreme court because if they let you sue remington
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.160]  and say they're responsible if someone does something illegally with it well then if i go
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:15.520]  by a butcher knife and kill somebody ginsu knives is liable but they run thousands of articles
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:22.720]  a day right now it's in newspapers all over texas all over the nation that i lost a lawsuit
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:28.640]  you go why would they do that because it creates the illusion that i'm a loser and i'm guilty well
[01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.480]  you know what i am guilty of beating hillary politically and so are you and i'm guilty of
[01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:37.760]  loving god and loving america and i'm guilty of standing against these people and never submitting
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:46.240]  and i've never been stronger join god folks don't be afraid of evil and ask god for guidance
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:51.920]  and ask god for the holy spirit i'm telling you you will experience enlightenment and discernment

[01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:29.360]  because they're of their father the devil the clinton's all of them look at them thank god you're
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:35.680]  not with them i'm ready to die for christ i'm not scared of blumenthal i'm not scared of hillary

[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.560]  brother i uh i i completely understand pretty much almost everything you said there so i'm glad
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:51.840]  that you just finished off that rant but you know what i'll just say this a lot of times you know you
[01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:56.480]  may seem erratic to the audience i may seem erratic but you gotta understand when you're
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.440]  dealing with this stuff and when you see this i mean it's beyond corruption i mean these these
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:05.920]  people are outright they're saying yeah they're saying you really can't believe it so we're not in
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:10.480]  a comfort zone and i was saying this the other day as soon as you get into comfort zone this is a
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:15.760]  revolutionary war as soon as you're comfortable you lose the revolution the revolution dies
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.520]  so we have to have total victory in this revolution before we can ever get comfortable so we're not
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.880]  going to be comfortable um like some other people out there just because trump is in office and the
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:29.200]  ratings are up at you know the conservative news networks we don't want to be delusional winners

[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.320]  winning they're losing but they've got to lose completely and so here's a loss that we're dealing

[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:56.480]  ones here is in fact i'm going to cover this later after oan leaves us fires did not cause
[02:00:56.480 --> 02:01:01.760]  wtc seven collapse new study finds really i only talked to the cops who heard the government
[02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:06.080]  countdown to blow it up only interviewed the head of emergency management before he died a week later
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:11.680]  saying there were bombs in the building oh and though some stations don't care this five minutes but
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:16.960]  we were talking about the celebration of pooping and now it's a sacrament of the left
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:21.360]  they're now saying it's racist to stop public pooping in seattle uh here's a new one portland
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:26.720]  cops say it's illegal i'm excuse me out of 40 and slip cops say it's legal for homeless to
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:32.400]  defecate in public and that it's a human right and i have tv shows city council members in portland
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:38.640]  saying it's fun it's part of what portlanders do uh and so this isn't a joke this is a way to implode
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:43.840]  we'll talk about why they're doing it it's a plan the way austin took the way the leftist took over
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.800]  the city from la and collapsed it in the last just few years you've been only been here three years
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:54.960]  you've watched it well that's what's really sad about this is when i got here just over three years
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:00.720]  ago uh the only real problems that that the city had was some infrastructure problems because it's
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:07.360]  such a expanding metropolitan area a lot of big tech and and stuff moving in here so a lot of
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:12.560]  population density infrastructure was kind of struggling with that but as far as you know
[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.920]  feces on the streets tent cities being set up aggressive drug addict homeless people on the
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.720]  streets everywhere running the town uh wasn't really an issue that was all concentrated around
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.640]  an area called the arch pretty much kept to a couple blocks up there well it was pretty much
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:35.440]  much kind of stabilized in that sort of uh uh you know issue sector like it wasn't a big issue
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:40.880]  and then the city council decided to amend the city ordinance in july saying it's now legal to camp
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.440]  out on the city sidewalk uh you know poop on the city sidewalk sleep on the city side including
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:49.440]  people's houses anything you want to do it's all good now front of businesses restaurants and so
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:54.160]  you know you'll just pull up at the restaurant there's just eight people laughing at you shooting
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:03:01.520]  up heroin pooping everywhere and so this is going on but it seemingly happened overnight and in fact
[02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:05.440]  i was you understand it's a spiritual invasion force though the left doesn't just cater to it
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:11.440]  make money off of it and skin the cash this is these higher level demons like don't materialize
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:16.000]  until their gremlin forces there so it's like for each major demon possession that happens i think
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:21.360]  they have a certain number of gremlins humans to carry lower servant demons so i think that's why
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:25.680]  so i think that's why the left brings all this in and celebrates it is to get the servant demons
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:30.320]  into position so that they can bring in a heavy hitter yeah and it's kind of a by the way i'm
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.600]  not kidding no well it's kind of psychological tactic and to kind of bring that to a more uh
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:42.000]  smaller level it's kind of like a drag queen story time where even though i'm a man if i get you to
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:46.560]  say i'm a woman i've i've defeated you i've and you don't have to creep around at parks anymore
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:51.840]  and go kid come here now you're worshiped as a pita like yeah if i can just say the city's
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:55.920]  wide open you can go crap on the streets we're not even going to clean it up that's just a victory
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:04:00.080]  over you as a good you know it exactly it's just like the samurai in japan if they'd conquered
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:04.880]  using them to piss on you they're pissing on us like you should feel bad oh you're not allowed
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:10.480]  to live in a civilization we don't live in high society we don't this is not an advanced civilization
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:13.920]  no no no we live in a third world country now you see you've been defeated because they're
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.360]  getting you ready for the real third world invasion because that this is the normalization
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.440]  claiming it's exactly so now you're off from the temporal level and we look at the spiritual level
[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:26.000]  of it but getting back to what we're dealing with here in austin so it was like almost overnight
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.280]  alice i went i took a vacation uh three weeks ago i was out for a week and actually uh savannah
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:35.040]  hernandez was in hong kong and we were talking about how we both kind of got back at the same time
[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:41.200]  and it was just literally in a double there's now people running around in clown mask i was not
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:46.880]  trying to see it this morning and it's like drug addict zombies everywhere three times i saw half
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:51.360]  naked people in underwear with crap running down their legs bombed out of their brain just the
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:05:02.320]  way it sounds like an average day in austin band dot video is the answer to censorship band dot video
[02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:09.040]  is the answer for libertarians conservatives nationalists pro gun pro life pro human individuals
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:15.920]  to have their own platform where videos banned by youtube facebook and twitter are still available
[02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:22.960]  we've launched it ladies and gentlemen it's now live band dot video band dot video isn't just going
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:28.640]  to be a home for alex jones or david knight or oan shroyer or paul watson band videos we are
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:34.640]  building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and we're a growing list of freedom

[02:05:53.280 --> 02:06:07.040]  tyranny at band dot video
[02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:11.440]  you know i like lucy in the sky with diamonds beautiful pretty things happy people but instead
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:15.840]  we're told to worship homeless these aren't the old-fashioned hobos or mentally ill people that's
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:21.920]  maybe 10 of them it's aggressive drug addicts they're called campers by the city of austin
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:26.560]  and most of them are white and a lot of them are really old it's kind of like retirees they all
[02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:32.080]  just lay out on lawn chairs right in front of your house neighborhoods restaurants and they just
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:36.640]  lay out and shoot heroin up and crap everywhere they also kidnap dogs out of your backyard they're
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:40.880]  always caught and then people always find their dogs later they chain them up to get more money
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:47.840]  people are running around wearing purge mask they're waving mexican flags it's bizarre and there's
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:52.880]  all these little weird tribes they call them drag rats they run around robbing people raping people
[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:58.640]  killing people uh ut is told austin they're they're gonna arrest these people austin's battling ut
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:03.680]  have articles portland cops say it's legal for homeless to defecate in public part of their
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:08.960]  civil rights that's on info wars dot com with the local newscast and again they're saying cleaning it
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:14.240]  off in seattle is a racist sign even though the most of the people doing are white heroin heads
[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:18.080]  and that it reminds them of blacks being sprayed with water cannons they're in the civil rights
[02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:22.480]  movement so they're not going to clean the poop or the needles now oh and you you said it it's an
[02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:27.760]  act of spiritual and cultural and political dominance that they literally flipped a switch
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:35.680]  recap all that you said it so well well when you see it firsthand it changes everything we i've
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:42.320]  seen this from you know a different perspective not living in la not living in san francisco not
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:46.800]  living in seattle but seeing it when you travel there briefly seeing it on the news seeing the
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:51.040]  video so you see the tent cities you see the craziness you see the drug addicts you see the
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.960]  spiritual decay in these tent cities in these sanctuary cities into these democrat run liberal
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:08:04.000]  progressive cities but now that it's come to austin and you witness it firsthand i mean it's
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:11.280]  it's really a survival instinct not only as a member of this city but spiritually you don't
[02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:17.600]  want to see this city decayed into this and these are deranged sickening evil people everyone kisses
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:23.200]  their ass no i'll tell you go i mean my cousin in seattle got bitten by a homeless person he was
[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:28.400]  giving a 10 he worked for microsoft making 300 000 a year he was giving a ten dollar bill
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:36.480]  ten dollar bill to a homeless person another one bidding he got a blood infection uh had
[02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:43.520]  liver failure and it took him a few years to die but a homeless zombie killed my cousin and you're
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:48.320]  not allowed to say oh i don't want to live in a city like that no you see you don't live in
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:54.000]  advanced civilization alex you don't live in a high technological civilization my first cousin
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.760]  was killed by a zombie no because see again you you're not allowed to live in advanced civilization
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:04.880]  you're not allowed to live in high society no you have to live in a third world drag otherwise
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:08.240]  we're gonna go to your report in a moment but you guys run b-roll the woman stabbing the kid in the
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:13.760]  face and and and you know the people but people biting each other now i mean this isn't just drugs
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:20.000]  this is this is a demonic takeover you don't pay taxes to live and in advanced civilization you
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:26.560]  don't pay taxes to have infrastructure and clean city streets alex you live in a city and pay taxes
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:33.040]  so that homeless people can run it and poop and pee wherever they want but the transition overnight
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:37.760]  and awesome this is crazy guys if you pull up the story from kellen mcreen so i call kellen mcreen

[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:19.120]  crazy just 24 hours ago they cleaned up this area it's literally back to a tent city he goes out there
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:25.760]  takes all these pictures of the exact areas where the cops just cleaned up 24 hours and they're right
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:30.720]  back set up on a tent city deal i went back into the woods they're playing this hd report we shot i
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:37.040]  went back in the woods hundreds of yards of trash miles back into the woods where these people go
[02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:41.760]  well they used to go now they just do it in the middle of the street and by the way austin has
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:47.680]  hundreds of miles of trails the deepest forest ones now or back behind neighborhoods have and
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:51.200]  these homeless people the first time this happened it was like 15 years ago there was some cliffs like
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:57.200]  100 feet tall they threw big boulders tried to kill me yeah oh what i've got here if you got down by
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:01.920]  the arts which is where it's the worst because that's the big facility they have to help these
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.400]  people and feed them and give them clothes you'll go down there if you go down there at the wrong
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:11.760]  time you need a helmet just to walk around and no one tells people this when they invite
[02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:16.800]  high schools and colleges to come to austin oh listen folks i'm a tough guy there used to be a
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:21.680]  lot of great restaurants downtown i will not go downtown anymore because of the zombie force
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:26.720]  no alex it's it's worse than i ever imagined i'm getting messages people are saying they're
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:30.880]  canceling field trips to the city people are saying like you they're not taking their wife
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:35.280]  out to dinner in the city nobody's going downtown anymore man it's not just downtown we're in a
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.440]  totally different part of austin and i can go 200 yards this way 700 yards that way and that's just
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.880]  what i know of and the thing is they're hateful and satanic i mean we get you a live feed and go
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.840]  500 yards right now and then you drive by and they go and then the people that bring them drugs you'll
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:57.280]  park right in the main road under the overpass blocking you and sell them drugs right in front of
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:03.520]  you and there's some satanic blob he drives a gold ford pickup i see him all the time the opposite
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.280]  selling drugs he pulls up and delivers them the drugs because they all get welfare and city
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:13.920]  assistance and then all goes right to the drug dealer big fat white dude who pulls up and he
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:18.640]  doesn't even pull from the curb he just pulls up and sells them the drugs right there it's all
[02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:26.480]  entitled they are entitled and if you dare if you dare infringe on whatever they believe they're
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.440]  entitled to they get out and here's the one place though tell them again the city said you can't camp
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:38.000]  is the city hall so you went down there and camp so oh jeez oh sorry the crew is just showing images
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:44.080]  of these people yeah alex so the thing is such a joke i'm driving down the road and there's a
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:50.000]  damn this guy's having a damn cookout he's got a lazy boy he's got a tv set up he's got a grill
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:57.120]  fired up it's out of control so i figured fine why should i pay an exorbitant fee to rent a park
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:01.440]  or rent a recreation center or something like that i'll just go set up and i'll have a party
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:07.280]  right in front of city hall i'm gonna do it again so so so oh and by the way guys when we have the
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:11.040]  city cookout guess what you can go into city hall and use their facilities you don't have to crap on
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:15.520]  the street either we'll just go and that but that she may or they don't even want to do that i say
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:21.360]  i say since the city says you crap on the street i say crap in the city council rooms
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:27.440]  i maybe we should go take a dump live at three minute communication alex i've done a lot of
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:31.440]  stuff i've done a lot of stuff for him sounds like yet my goodness i've done a lot of stuff
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.280]  from info wars i've done a lot of stuff for alex jones you think i should just drop trial in the
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:40.240]  middle of city council and just pitch one no i think that don't do that excuse me number two
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:44.000]  alex no no no we're not encouraging anybody to do that alex are you calling for a number two right
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.120]  now no no let's let's just call it for the number two no no let's not do it oh and let's not do it
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.920]  but but i'm serious i think we should find where all the city council members that voted for this
[02:13:53.920 --> 02:13:58.320]  and i think we should encourage and go online because the the homeless are all on ipads and
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:02.560]  phones they're given to we should invite everybody and say we're gonna have free barbecue at their
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:06.640]  house and then we should give the money to camp in front of their houses that's it
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:12.880]  well that's it that's the operation i'll i'll bring the scum of the earth to their house we'll
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:16.880]  put a little circle on the street we'll just spray paint a little circle that'll be the uh
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.040]  well no no no we'll tell them the bathroom is defecating on the cars of the city council members
[02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:24.800]  well we don't want to they might get upset about that but if that's illegal still if we just put
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:28.000]  a little circle in the street we'll just call that the toilet we'll just put a little circle in the
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000]  street and say that's the bathroom right there co-ed stay there i want to play your format report
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.680]  and ride the shotgun with us as will johnson has been here visiting with us very exciting things

[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:42.800]  all reports are up on info wars dot com and news wars dot com we should probably run after doing
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:46.800]  the break and ask one of the riders to kind of put a conflagration of all the stuff you
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.640] 've done the last week up there and savanna did a great job in front of city council
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.800]  and the crazier part is when you go down there oh and there are the defenders of this screaming
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:58.800]  you down saying we're taking over well there were a couple that just didn't like us because we were
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:04.240]  the info wars and they just don't like info wars at all but most of the reaction i got was actually
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.040]  positive people walking out saying hey thank you and that's the key all over the country people
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:14.080]  don't want this in san francisco or seattle but the elites do it because there's a reason they're
[02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:18.960]  doing it and it's an act of dominance to bring down civilization and guess a lot of them someone
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:23.200]  who walked by and asked because they didn't like my setup somebody walked by and go oh do you vote

[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:49.440]  logan paul and just since i'd been there three or four months earlier it was already worse i mean
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:54.960]  it was like every road every area i was in different parts of la going all these podcasts and it was
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:01.600]  like up on top of hill by the side of the road underpasses it just it's everywhere and the people
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:09.120]  are laid out smoking cigarettes uh dudes having sex uh just right there as you're driving down the

[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:35.360]  like in zombie movies they're real slow kind of like in the last man on earth with vincent price
[02:34:35.360 --> 02:34:40.080]  the original they got made it i am legend all that yeah where there's bombies are real slow but
[02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:43.760]  sometimes you kind of forget and all of a sudden one's right there we're sitting there interviewing
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:49.200]  somebody at skid row and all of a sudden i kind of ignored them and gone past because these dudes
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:53.600]  were having sex in the tent right there all of a sudden i turn around and they're right there
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:59.120]  okay a black guy dressed like a woman and a white guy and i'm telling you still fornicating one of
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:05.280]  them was naked had flies all over them and white stuff smeared all over them and sweat and and i'm
[02:35:05.280 --> 02:35:10.240]  telling you it was so shriveled it was like like melting black wax was his belly it was like
[02:35:10.240 --> 02:35:15.200]  gribble it was like rotting you could see his spinal cord and then big wounds in his arms from
[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:21.760]  all the heroin and he was like and the other guy was looking at me like coming at me sexually
[02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:27.120]  and we ran yeah i mean i've never in a nightmare never i've never seen that in a movie dude
[02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:33.120]  the smell of vision i began vomiting as i was running because i look i'm gonna look at it flies
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:38.880]  and all that sound of it makes me want to vomit i'm telling you man i've seen hell this is this
[02:35:38.880 --> 02:35:44.080]  is this sounds like a once in a lifetime experience Alex you just got a free show that's what that is
[02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:48.640]  you know the type of money people pay for that kind of entertainment you should be thanking the
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:53.120]  california government but you know what on a serious note isn't it sad though because californ
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:59.120]  los angeles is such a beautiful city i mean the mountains the ocean i mean the weather it's all
[02:35:59.120 --> 02:36:04.480]  yes what a beautiful city and they just let these people just ruin it like they don't even care and
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:10.480]  then they say oh don't have a plastic straw oh don't drive a car you're going to destroy the
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:15.200]  planet meanwhile they literally turn their most beautiful cities into third world hell halls well
[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.440]  johnson what's going on there you know before i moved to california they were telling me that the
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:25.280]  smog in la was really thick but when i moved to california you could see the top of the buildings
[02:36:25.280 --> 02:36:30.640]  it was absolutely wonderful i'm like look at this beautiful city and then because they fixed the
[02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:38.080]  climate issue in la they fixed all of that they have to target something else where they target now
[02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:42.800]  they want to target homeless they want to create an epidemic they want to create these diseases they
[02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:47.360]  have to have something else and you know what i know this kind of off topic but you know what the
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:50.320]  climate change the only reason why i'm thinking about it because the clowns were just they just had
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:54.880]  a thing on the communist news network talking about the climate change in la and you brought up la
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:37:03.200]  and la is now a beautiful city the air is clear and because they are doing because they're doing
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:10.160]  i was fixing that one's microphone sorry because you know because the air quality in la is so much
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:15.600]  better now they get the focus on creating another problem why don't they just follow the model that
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:21.840]  la did for the climate change there's no more fog there's no more there's no more smog in the air
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:29.440]  it's clear i know it's a different subject but the the homelessness in la in san francisco
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:37.280]  is so bad that they're happy with the outcome that they've done they're happy with it they're like
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:41.920]  this is the model this is what we want to do oh the mayor went on k lbj in july when they first
[02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:47.200]  did this and said we want you to know it's a problem so we get more funding and so we're
[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:51.280]  going to tell them to sleep in your yard but all they were really doing was inviting everyone here
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:56.960]  well yeah it's supposedly right now california has a surplus how come they're not fixing the issue
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:01.200]  if california has a surplus how come they're not fixing the issue they still have all these
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:07.040]  homeless that are living everywhere the defecating industries there's needles everywhere and there's
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:12.480]  not just men they're women and children and then democrats act like they're all so loving and
[02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:16.880]  compacted oh yeah the cps doesn't cps doesn't take the kids away when it's some young 20-year-old
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.200]  woman bombed out of her brain on heroin they're doing tricks right there in a tent and there's a
[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:26.320]  five-year-old kid yeah of course because that's what they want they want people living in this
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:32.560]  condition and this is sickening and what do we do you know what i think oh and sick the example
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:37.520]  when you go to these meetings don't sit idly by why they're just okay this is how we're going to be
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.360]  we're going to talk what are they going to do if 50 of you go in there and yell and scream and
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:45.520]  and tell the city council did you see how the mayor and them would get those weird demonic
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:50.640]  possum smiles people like hey you live 50 stories up at a four million dollar condo you don't have
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:55.440]  to live down on the streets with this he's like smiling he loves what he's doing oh when we go to
[02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:59.680]  the city council meetings in fact when we go to city council meetings now mayor adler just leaves
[02:38:59.680 --> 02:39:03.840]  he don't he laughs and he just leaves the room now because you know he's heard enough about that shows
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:08.080]  how much he cares but yeah it's the same thing in fact i caught one of the city council members
[02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:13.840]  illegally campaigning within 50 yards of a polling station they're doing at the entrance
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:19.600]  and i called him out on he laughs it's like you said it's like we screwed you over i'm telling you
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:25.120]  it's the same thing it's just it's it's the psychology this mindset of i'm going to deceive you
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:29.840]  and then you're going to accept it and that's just a total psychological conquering of you
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:36.000]  there's total lawlessness i mean they they they disregard the law a hundred percent they don't
[02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:42.560]  care about truth they don't care about facts for them is truth over facts you know so they
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:47.440]  wanted to run this whole agenda against the american people and american people supposed to
[02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:53.120]  sit idly by why it's taking place well well that's the thing is we all know they lie but i mean when
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:57.840]  ap runs a headline that i wrote a book about sandy hook and i lost a million dollar three million
[02:39:57.840 --> 02:40:02.960]  dollar lawsuit and like none of it's true it's not like they lied some they create a whole fake
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:10.720]  story none of it's true and then now they're running news stories where what the basis of what
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:15.840]  they're saying is not true the judge didn't even have a ruling he said no the lawsuit goes forward
[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.920]  so the state court said no you got to have a hearing before we can even have an appeal
[02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:25.440]  so that actually creates more time for us and everything so we actually won on this latest
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.240]  thing they turned it into a defeat you know what i have the issue with with the sandy hook
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:34.560]  and you brought it up i the issue that i have is that they don't want people to question things
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:41.600]  it's even so i'm gonna give you an example talk about the moon landing now i love space travel i
[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:47.440]  want to be able to space travel i want to do all of that but i question did we actually land on the
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:52.240]  moon that's right it's the same thing with sandy hook you should have every right to question it now
[02:40:52.240 --> 02:40:57.440]  the problem the main problem here is that they're going after people for questioning anything that
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.000]  the media is telling us that's what people are well they lie and say i sent people to their houses
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:07.520]  it's all alive it's all right but they but people are upset because you question what they tell what
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:12.000]  they're telling us that's what it ultimately comes down to don't question what we're telling you
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:16.960]  believe everything you're supposed to believe everything you're supposed to accept it that is
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:23.280]  what and if you don't accept it then you're the enemy then you're bad question everything even if
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:28.320]  you're wrong you question it when we stop questioning stuff we stop questioning our humanity we
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:33.840]  stop questioning everything we lose your that's basic human right is the question if i want to
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.200]  say the moon's made of cheese it's my right absolutely you have every right to say so just
[02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:44.240]  like when owen went there he have every right to stand up and say we need to stand up and stop
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:50.000]  being so complacent and start addressing the main issue that's happening here people if no one does
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:54.240]  anything if no one says anything we're going to live in this condition for the end of time and they're
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:59.120]  just going to run all over america kill the american people and they don't care and they know they're
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:02.880]  going to do that because that is their agenda that's right and again the homeless people that bag on
[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.640]  the street corners a lot of them live in nice homes and stuff and a lot of that's a scam if you
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.600]  want to give people money you'll do it all day but the old-fashioned homeless that's not what's
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:18.000]  going on this giant invasion is lazy people that want to take drugs and not work and they're mean
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:25.280]  and they're criminal and they killed my cousin i was close to my cousin they killed him a zombie
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:32.160]  killed a member of my family killed him yeah that's footage that we shot that is in skid row

[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:37.920]  backup and some technical stuff but uh tell us about your show because i mean i've been talking
[02:48:37.920 --> 02:48:40.960]  about it for months with you but i've been i've been so busy that i don't know the particulars tell
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:46.640]  me about uh it's called firepower yes it's firepower with will johnson tell us about so you know
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:53.040]  my my thing is is that i don't have the power and i don't have the fire but i want to be on fire for
[02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:59.440]  god that's my thing i want to be on fire for god and be in for this country because if we
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:05.360]  don't get off of our butts right now come 2020 we're not going to have a country the left they're
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:12.400]  trying to do everything they can to destroy every free thing that we have this the luxuries that we
[02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:17.200]  have as americans so my show is going to consist of bringing guests on multiple guests we're going
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:22.240]  to be talking about the daily topics uh we're going to show multiple clips of everything that's going
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:26.640]  on and you were saying kind of an espn countdown every hour at least a segment or two well yeah so
[02:49:26.640 --> 02:49:32.320]  one of the things uh i came up with we're we're going to talk about uh we'll say who's on fire
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:38.960]  like for example oh and he was on fire when he went to that to that meeting on was on fire
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:43.680]  and then who was in the line of fire you know we could talk about it doesn't have to be a person
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:48.960]  it could be like the like the state of uh florida who's in the line of fire the storm is coming
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:57.280]  and who who got burned you know raya scepter he got burned again mark that's awesome and and again
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:49:59.920]  you were the one we were talking about this months ago you told me you were developing the show i said
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:03.600]  well i want to pick that up i want to carry it you were saying and listen alex you need to get
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:07.920]  out with a microphone and get in front of things like you do every once while and get and so you
[02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:11.200]  were the one encouraged me to do that so you're a good talk show host and getting better you're
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:16.080]  better than i was when i was first starting out but when it comes to ideas you got really good ideas
[02:50:16.080 --> 02:50:22.480]  well you know i just want to be creative as much as possible and um i think uh creativity comes out
[02:50:22.480 --> 02:50:27.200]  when you have freedom to do what you want to do and i think with this show i've been extremely
[02:50:27.200 --> 02:50:32.960]  blessed with firepower extremely blessed and i realized what i have and i wanted to take advantage
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:38.320]  of it a hundred percent and just be creative as much as possible and i think i want to reach people
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:42.400]  that don't see what they normally see because you know the mainstream media they're not going to
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:48.720]  give it to you um info wars has been given it to people for years for years so i just want to love
[02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:54.240]  to be able to achieve something that no one else has and you had a group of like like some focus
[02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:57.600]  groups you're going to bring i've seen it before you're going to bring in groups of people you're
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:01.840]  going to bring listeners in yeah so as the show progresses and grows that we're going to have a
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:06.400]  panel of people to come on and hopefully we can have like four maybe five people sitting down
[02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:11.280]  together talking about different things talking about the hot topics and i would love to have
[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:15.200]  people with opposing opinions you know not just someone who's going to agree with me
[02:51:15.200 --> 02:51:19.440]  i mean i think we try to do that i don't know how to get the best conversation the best conversations
[02:51:19.440 --> 02:51:24.240]  are ones with people disagreeing with you i totally agree so so many other exciting ideas so this
[02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:30.160]  starts next monday next monday at seven p.m central seven tonight and we're going to be carrying it
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:35.360]  here and then i guess soon we're going to be launching another special hour show we're working
[02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:39.920]  with some folks that's in between six and seven before you go on we'll work with some other folks
[02:51:39.920 --> 02:51:46.400]  soon to launch overnight because here's the thing at least until midnight 2020 is the big year i mean
[02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:52.960]  you think 2018 was key 2016 was key the globalists are putting all their firepower down range of us
[02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:57.440]  we've got intellectual power they've got bullying they've got violence and so when you have the idea
[02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:06.240]  for what's on fire um what's under fire and who's getting burned that's all genius the ideas of
[02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:11.040]  getting out in front of people doing things all of that i think this is going to be a really special
[02:52:11.040 --> 02:52:15.920]  show and i guess it kicks off a few days before we're going to have the live coverage of the
[02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:19.680]  democrat debates in houston we're going to have reporters on the ground i heard somebody might be
[02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:27.520]  going i don't know is that a little foreshadowing there oh and i'm really excited about the things
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:30.480]  that are happening the things that are going on and again papert's already been building his own
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:37.040]  studio magically it's done next week um and again he's going to be doing his own shows he's going to
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:41.680]  be co-hosting and helping produce a lot with scott and others with firepower he's great on air
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:45.200]  and again we're going to have a large panels it's going to be very exciting and again
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:50.960]  it's not an info wars show ladies and gentlemen it is will johnson but we're going to be helping him
[02:52:51.680 --> 02:52:56.320]  in the production of it and things like that we're very very excited about it and i'm also told you
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:53:02.800]  have a website that it's about to be uh active yes it's uh firepowerduce.com you'd be able to go there
[02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:08.800]  and also a lot of my videos will be on band dot video and that is our site band dot video and more
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:12.400]  and more info wars is flooded with all our great video content but it does cover up a lot of the
[02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:16.640]  written content so more and more we're going to have links in the articles saying go to david
[02:53:16.640 --> 02:53:21.440]  night's page go to will johnson's firepower page go to on shortage page go to paul wasa's page and
[02:53:21.440 --> 02:53:25.440]  we're going to add a lot of other contributors again where we won't we won't even be helping in
[02:53:25.440 --> 02:53:30.240]  the production it'll just be a place where they know it'll always be there uh and so they can
[02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:35.520]  mirror it when it's getting censored other places and a lot of these videos are getting 300 400 000
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:39.920]  views the average views about 10 000 but we're putting up hundreds a day so there's cut there's
[02:53:39.920 --> 02:53:46.560]  kind of a glut and we have now over 650 million views just on our live streams in the last six
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:52.000]  months alone hundreds of millions of views of our videos overall that really outrages the system
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:57.680]  that we've built our own infrastructure at band dot video that's band dot video also info wars.com
[02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:03.920]  forward slash show and will's going to have his own page soon added there again we're going to have
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:08.720]  other contributors we're hiring a lot of crew a lot of producers a lot of people to do video
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:13.520]  switchers just so we can do things like grab other people's productions and then bring them in and
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:19.600]  send them up on satellite we're on two tv satellites right now costing us you know tens of thousands
[02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:25.520]  dollars a month i'm watching other satellites i'm putting everything i've got i've not paid myself
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:32.240]  in over a year that's fine uh quite frankly i've talked to family if i need to uh inheritances
[02:54:32.240 --> 02:54:36.240]  and things i never got i've never gotten any family help doing this uh i'll sell the farm
[02:54:36.240 --> 02:54:42.880]  okay i mean we are total commitment our forebears did it they lost everything to give us this i am
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:50.080]  honored to do this but it'd make it a lot easier folks if folks simply flood us with the cash to
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:56.080]  fight the war i'll sell the farm the remnant of it in our family's hands since 1822 i'm ready to do it
[02:54:56.080 --> 02:55:00.720]  okay that's what this comes down to i'll sell the farm for this country and the unborn children
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:04.960]  that's not a cost that's an honor and a pleasure but selling the farm only run this place a few
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:09.680]  months ladies and gentlemen we need your support in four store dot com right now well i just want
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:14.240]  to say i've i've witnessed what you're talking about firsthand so if anybody doubts that i can
[02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:20.000]  tell you firsthand that that is true but just in the uh over three years that i've been working here
[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:26.400]  i've seen infowars come so far alex it's really just been an unbelievable growth here and to know
[02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:32.880]  that this is something that has been an independent endeavor of alex jones and the people here and
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:38.640]  the audience that's what angers the globalist so much that's what angers democrats so much that's
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:44.160]  what angers control freaks so much they can't control this they have no means of control of this
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:50.560]  news organization other than trying to engage in lawfare against us libel us attack us with fake
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.040]  news and all this stuff they they have no levers of power here they don't have anybody in the doors
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:59.520]  paying our bills we don't have any sponsors that can tell us you can't they can put a gun to our head
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:03.760]  and we're not backing down and so it's just been an unbelievable experience to just witness the
[02:56:03.760 --> 02:56:10.160]  growth of infowars in the three-plus years that i've been here and just the steadfastness that
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:15.360]  you've had in your commitment to expand so it's been it's been unbelievable and i think that you
[02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:20.720]  know when we get to uh it's it's almost to the prime of the election season you know we're just
[02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:25.520]  running back and looking at some videos that young man oh and who is that guy anyway i don't even
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:31.120]  recognize that that's unbelievable right there wow how many years like three years ago not even man
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:38.000]  that was in uh santilly virginia just uh just at the bill de berg conference of 2000 and i think
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:44.000]  i think 18 or 17 maybe but that's just the stuff we do alex you send me around the states we cover
[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.560]  it you hire new reporters uh we do everything we can well it's our listeners that have that have
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:52.400]  done this and again they've tried to crush us they've tried to destroy us but we're still on
[02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:58.640]  air we're fighting back share the links info wars dot com forward slash show band dot video but i'm
[02:56:58.640 --> 02:57:02.400]  promoting everybody i told paul hey they could try to shut us down you know who knows they might
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:07.120]  kill me put me in prison you better start a new fancy nice website and i encourage paul he's soon
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:13.120]  gonna put out ads and try to hire a few reporters and camera people uh there in uh london and i mean
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:18.080]  that's true leadership is not making it all about yourself it's about growing teams uh we're not
[02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:24.640]  launching lifeboats either we're launching uh like genesis ships of new groups and people to go out
[02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:28.720]  and continue the fight against the new world order uh and we're not expecting to be defeated
[02:57:28.720 --> 02:57:35.120]  but we're making sure uh that we lay a lot of eggs on the way to the fight because long after
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:40.640]  we're gone a fight against evil will continue we'll be back with the fourth hour to finish

[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:21.840]  as you know as long as twitter doesn't get upset because a black man is talking about support
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:27.200]  for president trump and a black man is sitting here with owen and and alex jones a lot of people
[03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:32.880]  who might oh no no no but you know what makes me think about and it's all related i want to address
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:37.920]  the issues how they're always constantly saying that white people are races in this country and
[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:42.480]  most of the time when they do that it's always the white people that's doing something that's helping
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:47.520]  black people for example president trump president trump is doing more for any of the black people
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:53.200]  and any other president in in history and what they're calling him racist every single time
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:56.800]  i've noticed that when they have someone white that's doing something positive this
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:00.880]  and black people are benefiting they're calling them races it's happening it happens
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:05.360]  constantly but we know the democrats want dependency they want everybody dependent
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:08.800]  they want total control well even cnn actually just had to print a story today
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:14.080]  black unemployment rate lowest in recorded history what is it like though getting to know

[03:07:03.120 --> 03:07:08.480]  because what non-believers fail to understand is that calling a dream crazy is not an insult
[03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:20.160]  it's a compliment right now donald trump
[03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:24.320]  i know you don't believe that but i want to go on it's not going to be a president donald trump
[03:07:26.480 --> 03:07:36.160]  don't settle for homecoming queen or linebacker do both
[03:07:36.160 --> 03:07:48.160]  don't believe you have to be like anybody to be somebody
[03:07:52.880 --> 03:07:56.480]  and again this is manly for tv so ready to listen should go to memeworld.com
[03:07:56.480 --> 03:08:06.480]  wherever you do don't share any links believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything
[03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:16.480]  when they talk about the greatest team in the history of the sport make sure it's your team
[03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:26.480]  so
[03:08:29.920 --> 03:08:38.480]  yeah that's more like it so don't ask if your dreams are crazy ask if you're crazy enough
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:44.480]  so
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:53.120]  i wanted to get a carpet dog to pop in here as kind of one of the main meme guys out there
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:58.080]  working with trump you name it because you've got a contest coming up at memeworld.com that's
[03:08:58.080 --> 03:09:02.720]  almost about to close and people need really to get involved in this not for the money and the
[03:09:02.720 --> 03:09:08.080]  prizes but for the fight because the system is really scared of memes because ai has trouble
[03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:12.000]  flagging it and censoring it so it's getting through the enemy's defenses
[03:09:13.600 --> 03:09:22.320]  yes sir we've got a contest that is going to close in about three days and we've got a lot of
[03:09:23.360 --> 03:09:30.720]  good i'm sorry i'm fighting a cold so my brain is all over the place but we've got a lot of
[03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:39.600]  good submissions so far i don't know if you noticed but uh my voice has dropped about six
[03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:45.280]  octaves so i'm right around in the in alex jones range now so if people think that we're actually
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:50.080]  the same person i wouldn't be surprised but um no no no we're not abraham lincoln
[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:58.960]  but we've got uh got a bunch of good submissions um i just received probably four or five really
[03:09:58.960 --> 03:10:07.120]  really good videos uh people took some time to uh spend on them and just made them great so uh i'll
[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:14.160]  be putting out some of those in just a few days uh again the ninth i believe is uh is the last day
[03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:20.960]  so everybody has until the ninth to uh make a great meme for uh american priority
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:26.080]  well that's beautiful and when's that conference coming up that's helping sponsor this
[03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:33.600]  uh the american priority is in um it's in miami and it's uh the 10th through the 12th of october
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:39.280]  very so you've got about a month um and it's at the trump derau so it's gonna be uh as long as no
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:45.280]  hurricanes hit you know knock on wood before then uh should be a beautiful place in uh beautiful
[03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:52.880]  weather by the way i am again very pleased that trump's in very pleased he's gotten two
[03:10:52.880 --> 03:10:56.320]  supreme court justices light years better than what hillary would have done obviously
[03:10:57.120 --> 03:11:02.400]  and he's fighting for our economy he's fighting against the chai comms he's fighting to secure
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:06.240]  the border he has built a ton of fence the media lied about that he just said to the
[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:10.480]  board patrol where do you need it well it was all broken down where it was at but it's hundreds and
[03:11:10.480 --> 03:11:14.960]  hundreds of miles of new fence 70 something miles where there wasn't fence so it's like
[03:11:15.600 --> 03:11:19.440]  you know the numbers like 270 miles of fence if you really go deeper well against all this
[03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:25.280]  bureaucracy it's amazing but we're two days in here and we haven't seen the white house come out
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:31.440]  and repudiate the washington post article that he's looking at a digital red flag end of due process
[03:11:31.440 --> 03:11:37.360]  take our guns situation uh and i just really think trump needs to come out and repudiate that
[03:11:37.360 --> 03:11:43.200]  right now what do you think yeah um i i think that he should come out uh strongly and i mean
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:49.040]  if that's if that's what he wants to do that uh i i don't think that's a good idea uh but he
[03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:55.040]  should at least uh say one way or another if uh he's going to be sporting those things that i think
[03:11:55.040 --> 03:12:04.800]  the red flag of laws and the um the removal of of uh your right to you know a trial by jury and
[03:12:04.800 --> 03:12:09.840]  you know you have to do something wrong before you can be arrested i think that's a major
[03:12:11.120 --> 03:12:17.840]  part of our system you say i'm taking these guns to go kill somebody um then you can take the guns
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:22.800]  away it's a terrific threat but i don't want to be clear weeks after he said he was looking at red
[03:12:22.800 --> 03:12:27.920]  flags he said no it wouldn't save anybody uh i looked at it it's not a good idea we said that
[03:12:27.920 --> 03:12:32.960]  was coming i was like great wonderful it's this digital one that avonka's bringing forward that
[03:12:32.960 --> 03:12:41.680]  i'm really concerned about right and um again he's gonna he's gonna have to clarify um obviously
[03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:47.360]  we all want to support him in in what he does but uh there there's just certain things that um
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:55.040]  you can't uh you can't capitulate to you can't capitulate to these these uh 1984 type of thought
[03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:03.040]  crime and and online thought crime uh kind of stuff it's just it leads to just tyranny and and he's
[03:13:03.040 --> 03:13:09.200]  not gonna be present forever so uh these laws are all going to be on the books for uh years to come
[03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:17.920]  and today a democrat get elected in 2024 then uh they'll be able to use them just just how they
[03:13:17.920 --> 03:13:23.200]  can be used right now that brings me to my next question joe biden's eyes are literally bleeding
[03:13:23.200 --> 03:13:29.200]  during speeches he can't hardly talk now even politico says is he gonna drop out i mean i heard
[03:13:29.200 --> 03:13:34.320]  he's shooting his mouth i'm saying why do i do this obama told him not to run the guy's 76 okay
[03:13:34.320 --> 03:13:40.080]  so if you serve one term he'd be you know 81 when he got out of here two terms 80 85 no one's ever
[03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:45.680]  done that joe can't do it trump looks great at 73 biden looks like a reanimated you know piece of
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:52.640]  beef jerky uh at 76 but it'd be 77 what do you expect gut level i think he's got to drop out
[03:13:52.640 --> 03:14:00.960]  a if that's true who who who slips in there well i mean i i personally think that he's he's got to
[03:14:00.960 --> 03:14:08.160]  drop out like just the the lack of like he's not mentally sharp he's as sharp as i am right now and
[03:14:08.160 --> 03:14:16.800]  i'm barely functioning but uh he he can't he can't survive this uh he can't go up and debate in number
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:24.320]  one he can't debate trump he can't debate trump if he's only working with half a brain um but who
[03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:27.920]  slips into that spot i'm i've thought that elizabeth warren is probably the one that's
[03:14:27.920 --> 03:14:34.320]  going to slip in i i think too many people dislike kamala harris even on the left um i don't think
[03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:39.440]  that's uh any of the the men that are still left in there bernie doesn't really have a chance he's
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:46.320]  just as old as biden um i i really think that's if if it's going to come down to it it's probably
[03:14:46.320 --> 03:14:52.800]  going to be elizabeth warren um as as the backup candidate i agree and that's that's the white house
[03:14:52.800 --> 03:14:58.560]  thinks it's going to be how on earth are they going to have biden extricate himself uh because
[03:14:58.560 --> 03:15:01.760]  we said that three months ago or two and a half months ago we were right because i was told by
[03:15:01.760 --> 03:15:06.480]  secret service sources that he's saying i'm going to quit and cussing and yelling and why am i doing
[03:15:06.480 --> 03:15:12.720]  this i think that i wonder who's making him do it if obama told him not to well you know i i think
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:21.760]  that he's just i i think he has to run um all of the candidates are so far left that uh i mean
[03:15:21.760 --> 03:15:27.120]  they're alienating their own base and if he's just giving him exactly from all the socialists to make
[03:15:27.120 --> 03:15:34.320]  him look more you know regular six-pack joe that's exactly exactly all right carpe dunked him runs

[03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:18.320]  so
[03:21:22.880 --> 03:21:29.440]  and welcome back to info and this is dr nick baggage coming to you from alaska and
[03:21:29.440 --> 03:21:37.120]  and you know where do you start today right i mean um thinking about what's going on uh in the world
[03:21:37.120 --> 03:21:44.640]  and and and really at the low you know we're homeless deal right and and actually it's
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:52.240]  misnamed homelessness is not the issue it's uh alcohol and drug abuse okay uh so what has happened
[03:21:52.240 --> 03:22:00.000]  also is a lift uh the leftist hijacked uh the cause if you will and made it homelessness lack of housing
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:08.080]  and and actually that's maybe a symptom but it's not the cause okay uh the cause is alcoholism
[03:22:08.080 --> 03:22:14.480]  and drug addiction and mental illness and uh things that are not being addressed in a in really a
[03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:22.000]  good way and i want because i've been in a bunch of conversations this week about values you know
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:26.320]  it's kind of the basis of what we see in the world right is the manifestation of our values
[03:22:26.320 --> 03:22:34.320]  acted out on the playing field of life and what we're seeing um is really the degradation of it
[03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:41.680]  i mean the darkness of it uh if you will um is in front of us everywhere and at the local level
[03:22:41.680 --> 03:22:46.720]  especially and on the homelessness issue i want to talk about that during the course of the broadcast
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:52.080]  today because it's a national issue not just one local to austin even here in anchorage uh it's
[03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:58.720]  horrible what's happening um on the left coast um but i want to talk about a couple of things to
[03:22:58.720 --> 03:23:06.400]  kind of bring us into that conversation and first is the i want to talk about tolerance as a concept
[03:23:06.400 --> 03:23:14.000]  because it really grinds against certain aspects of me when i hear the left talking about tolerance
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:18.560]  um because what tolerance represents to me is um
[03:23:24.160 --> 03:23:29.360]  hatred if you will because when a person is tolerant using that phrase you're really accepting
[03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:34.480]  something that you don't accept right i mean you're silencing your speech for political reasons
[03:23:34.480 --> 03:23:39.280]  political correctness cultural reasons or other reasons you're just not saying what you feel in
[03:23:39.280 --> 03:23:46.160]  your heart and in your head um so that's tolerance and i don't think that's a good thing um in fact
[03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:51.840]  i think uh it runs counter to maybe what we're trying what we're striving for which is something
[03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:59.920]  that actually is deeper and and i want to talk about that in the context of all of this because
[03:23:59.920 --> 03:24:05.920]  acceptance is recognizing where someone is and meeting them there um and then you know i mean
[03:24:05.920 --> 03:24:12.560]  think about uh the the walk of christ you know he met people where they were not where he wished
[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:20.720]  they would be right he met the whores in the street and the lepers and the outcasts where they were
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:31.920]  how he hoped to be although he knew where they could be right so when i look at this crisis it's
[03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:38.320]  a crisis of guilt and poorly motivated wrong-headed approaches to solutions because they're not
[03:24:38.320 --> 03:24:45.040]  solution in fact they exacerbate the problem because providing homes for people that are
[03:24:45.040 --> 03:24:50.000]  drug addicts and alcoholics means that they can live a little more comfortably while they're
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:55.600]  drug addicts and alcoholics and it doesn't fix the problem and when people drop to a certain level
[03:24:55.600 --> 03:25:03.440]  you know you can let them stay there you can accept it um and tolerate it as the left is
[03:25:03.440 --> 03:25:09.680]  done and have them crafting on your streets from anchorage toss and because that's what happens here
[03:25:09.680 --> 03:25:15.680]  too in anchorage alaska as much as that's hard to believe and it's a little tough on the tourist
[03:25:15.680 --> 03:25:22.400]  trade it's the truth and that's making people very uncomfortable you know and and here in anchorage
[03:25:22.400 --> 03:25:28.320]  and in alaska we have possibilities in fact we have possibilities everywhere for actual solutions
[03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:35.360]  but that requires being accountable and responsible for individual behavior and when people are
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:43.280]  committing crimes by defecating in the street or occupying public places or in trespass or whatever
[03:25:44.800 --> 03:25:50.720]  either we have a rule of law we have none and we have anarchy and i don't think that's what
[03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:58.320]  americans truly want we want a solution for sure but the ones being proposed are exacerbating the
[03:25:58.320 --> 03:26:06.560]  problem and creating havens for bad behavior that's not addressed now here in alaska in 1956
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:13.600]  two years uh three years actually before statehood they created the mental health trust right and it
[03:26:13.600 --> 03:26:18.320]  was a land trust and i've talked about economics before you know there's only four things that
[03:26:18.320 --> 03:26:24.320]  really matter land and natural resources labor entrepreneurship and capital equipment and real
[03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:30.240]  economies all the rest is you know the space between the paper stock certificates and money
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:38.000]  but they endowed this a million acres of land so that they could produce from the land
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:46.560]  rents and royalties from oil um gas minerals surfaces date etc to pay for mental health costs
[03:26:46.560 --> 03:26:51.440]  in alaska and i have to say you know there's been ups and downs in this i'm not going to get into
[03:26:51.440 --> 03:26:56.880]  the history takes too complex but the simplicity of it is it throws off 50 million a year in a
[03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:04.560]  state of 750 000 and it hasn't been able to address the problems in 1956 because they fail
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:11.280]  actually see because when you have a million acres of land and natural resources in alaska
[03:27:11.280 --> 03:27:17.200]  for over a half a century and you can't figure it out for the dysfunctional within a population
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:25.280]  of 750 000 you stamp f on it you call it a failure and you revamp the thing you re-examine what you're
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:30.960]  doing now in alaska at the same time we have a homeless crisis in anchorage 1100 people in the
[03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:38.480]  street estimated we have a facility north of anchorage with 900 empty beds and and it's
[03:27:38.480 --> 03:27:46.000]  furnished down to the forks and it's a an ex-prison right they closed it down you know not for lack of
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:51.520]  applicants but because they did now from my perspective and i propose this to our local
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:56.800]  assembly and the others i sent out over 500 papers on a presented in anchorage a number of times
[03:27:56.800 --> 03:28:02.000]  that they transfer that facility over the mental health trust for nothing it'll save the state seven
[03:28:02.000 --> 03:28:07.840]  and a half million a year in operating costs and then subcontract with anchorage to start arresting
[03:28:07.840 --> 03:28:14.480]  people and putting them in in compulsory rehabilitation because that's the only answer
[03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:21.760]  they can't do it themselves they're failing okay do we let our society crash and burn
[03:28:22.320 --> 03:28:26.800]  or do we hold people accountable and create a mechanism and i want to get into that mechanism
[03:28:26.800 --> 03:28:32.000]  after the break you know these this is a crisis that's happening around the world and if you travel
[03:28:32.000 --> 03:28:36.880]  around the world and you see how it ends you don't want that for the united states ladies and

[03:33:33.200 --> 03:33:39.520]  afternoon in most of the country you know when i i again getting back to the the underlying problems
[03:33:39.520 --> 03:33:44.480]  you know the value systems and sort of tagging some of these things you know i again thinking in
[03:33:44.480 --> 03:33:49.760]  terms of my own local neighborhood you know it's over a year ago uh my address this issue and i
[03:33:49.760 --> 03:33:54.880]  actually wrote a little four page you know white paper with a white paper and circulated at over
[03:33:54.880 --> 03:33:59.920]  500 people um in the hope someone would actually read it and do something with it you know that's
[03:33:59.920 --> 03:34:05.520]  in leadership went to a bunch of their committee meetings and so on um to try and push this forward
[03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:10.480]  and and just couldn't gain attraction because of the third piece of it everybody objected to
[03:34:10.480 --> 03:34:16.480]  which is um a user fee on alcohol right or a tax if you will if you want to call it that but i
[03:34:16.480 --> 03:34:22.560]  think it's a user fee um and here's why in Alaska we don't have an income tax we don't have a sales
[03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:26.880]  tax on the state level we don't have a state property tax we have a little bit of excise
[03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:34.320]  tax those cigarettes uh um alcohol and in alcohol uh state level we collect 10 cents a drink 10
[03:34:34.320 --> 03:34:41.040]  cents a beer 10 cents a glass of wine you know that's a weekly um 10 cents a shot uh if you
[03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:46.640]  figure it out at the local level in Anchorage we collect zero for alcohol no taxes on alcohol
[03:34:46.640 --> 03:34:53.600]  whatsoever zero 300 million in alcohol sales a year no taxes in Anchorage no user fee and you know
[03:34:53.600 --> 03:34:57.600]  you don't have to look far to see the results of alcoholism and Anchorage or anywhere else you
[03:34:57.600 --> 03:35:03.680]  live in the world but the point is it's a free ride for alcoholism and i don't like a free ride
[03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:09.760]  for anybody for anything and here's my view of it in Anchorage we collect 21 million a year
[03:35:09.760 --> 03:35:18.880]  in cigarette taxes no one's getting run over by uh a cigarette smoker for smoking cigarettes but
[03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:24.160]  you know 21 million um is what's collectedness i kind of think that's a user fee it's like you
[03:35:24.160 --> 03:35:30.560]  know nine bucks a pack or whatever it is in taxes versus a dollar in cigarette costs but you know
[03:35:30.560 --> 03:35:36.320]  hey you want to smoke pay your own bill you want to drink pay your own bill and pay my cost too
[03:35:36.320 --> 03:35:42.320]  because it costs me money for people to drink in Anchorage because we have a billion dollars with a
[03:35:42.320 --> 03:35:48.800]  b in public places parks trails just like you have in austin they can't use anymore you can't
[03:35:48.800 --> 03:35:54.960]  let your kids go out there when i was five i could play there you can't do it anymore if you're 20
[03:35:54.960 --> 03:36:00.400]  safely you know this is what's happened we'd given up our public places i can't check my mail on the
[03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:07.040]  weekends anymore at a federal post office because of homelessness and really it's not homeless it's
[03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:13.760]  alcoholics and drug addicts occupying the post office on the weekends you know this is what's
[03:36:13.760 --> 03:36:19.440]  happened to our the beginning okay you want to see what it looks like jump over the border to
[03:36:19.440 --> 03:36:25.680]  mexico and take a look around and you get a pretty good picture of it when your situation has become
[03:36:25.680 --> 03:36:32.080]  corrupted by a valueless system that wants to tolerate everything and it's not about
[03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:38.560]  tolerance okay it's about accepting what we see and then addressing it and here's the other thing
[03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:43.120]  that i really have a problem with on the left again it's about judgment you know everybody's
[03:36:43.120 --> 03:36:48.080]  saying oh you can't judge this you can't judge that blah blah blah i get that okay and even
[03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:53.040]  even from my perspective you know judging not lest you be judged okay i understand all that
[03:36:53.040 --> 03:37:00.160]  but what i can judge and i do judge every day with every interaction i have is what am i going to do
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:07.280]  okay we can do that we can make a judgment on how we're going to interact with someone else
[03:37:07.840 --> 03:37:14.640]  based on their behavior and that's okay we don't have to say all right your behavior is fine we're
[03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:20.080]  going to tolerate it no we don't have to tolerate it we can recognize it meet people where they are
[03:37:20.080 --> 03:37:27.200]  and then intervene like good good human beings should intervene and that means in this case
[03:37:27.200 --> 03:37:33.120]  in our culture in our society we arrest people for breaking the law and we hold them accountable
[03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:38.480]  and if they have mental illness we have the compassion as a culture to address them if they
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:43.200]  have drug and alcohol problems and those are their choices then we can put them in an environment
[03:37:43.200 --> 03:37:47.520]  where they don't get to make those choices anymore and we can maybe help them find a way through it
[03:37:47.520 --> 03:37:54.960]  but this idea of giving them a home and bonding that with public money in my community i find
[03:37:54.960 --> 03:38:01.520]  repugnant because the first step is we have to fix the underlying problems and not address the
[03:38:01.520 --> 03:38:06.880]  symptoms like we do in almost everything else in this country we need to get back to a value-based
[03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:12.240]  system where we share common values across political boundaries because we recognize the
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:21.280]  humanity of that and this is what needs to change and what we see happening is more separation
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:29.600]  from the tolerant left who truly are selfish self-centered human beings working in what they
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:34.960]  believe is someone else's interest and it is the same attitude that was here in my state
[03:38:34.960 --> 03:38:41.360]  in the 1960s and before when they were removing Native American children from their homes and
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:47.760]  putting them in boarding schools because we needed to civilize these people now i can tell you
[03:38:48.400 --> 03:38:54.960]  from my friends who had that experience this was a traumatic experience ladies and gentlemen just
[03:38:54.960 --> 03:39:00.080]  like it would be for every single soul listening to this but it was done with great intentions
[03:39:01.440 --> 03:39:08.560]  and there's a lot of things done with great intentions but doing it out of guilt and tolerance
[03:39:08.560 --> 03:39:14.720]  is selfish doing it out of acceptance and recognition of where people are and actually
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:21.360]  intervening and doing something about it is another matter and that's called tough love
[03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:30.000]  in the end of the day and it's the hardest thing human beings deal with because we get lost in our
[03:39:30.000 --> 03:39:34.560]  own guilt and stupidity in terms of how we're addressing the problem because we're doing it
[03:39:34.560 --> 03:39:40.480]  from our perspective what would we be doing if we were in that situation i understand that but
[03:39:40.480 --> 03:39:48.000]  there it is not you in that situation because you've chosen differently or you've had circumstances
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:53.440]  affect you differently you've decided to overcome the trauma that you faced in life differently
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:40:01.680]  because every living soul faces trauma in this lifetime because that's what life is about often
[03:40:01.680 --> 03:40:09.440]  often trauma overcoming and change and then there's the salvation in that you know overcoming
[03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:17.200]  and finding a way through it but it's not done by doing what we're doing you know here in Anchorage
[03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:22.240]  Tuesday i didn't even bother to go to our assembly meeting because our next agenda item is to create
[03:40:22.240 --> 03:40:32.960]  a permanent 10 camps what we're gonna now we're gonna tolerate that and accept that as our new
[03:40:32.960 --> 03:40:40.240]  normal this is not normal ladies and gentlemen in America and it shouldn't be normal in the
[03:40:40.240 --> 03:40:46.720]  richest state in the united states for capital Alaska and that's what it is we have all the
[03:40:46.720 --> 03:40:53.440]  resources under the sun and we cannot figure it out for lack of leadership the big deficit in
[03:40:53.440 --> 03:40:59.360]  the world is leadership we know what donald trump offered the world a baseball bat of leadership that
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:07.440]  was long overdue you know and we have a governor that's pissed off everybody simultaneously in
[03:41:07.440 --> 03:41:13.280]  alaska because of what he did with our budgets but he definitely got everyone engaged in the
[03:41:13.280 --> 03:41:19.200]  political process that we're pretty quiet for a long time and that's a healthy thing in a democratic
[03:41:19.200 --> 03:41:26.880]  republic in my view but real solutions to these problems needs to be addressed and leadership
[03:41:26.880 --> 03:41:34.560]  needs to address it and not by partling bad behavior and making it accepted no making it
[03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:40.960]  tolerates so we all swallow our tongue as we walk down the street no this is not the american
[03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:48.000]  character this is not our culture and this is not who we are and then the the left will say oh
[03:41:48.000 --> 03:41:55.440]  but you're making being poor a crime no we're not because those that are legitimately in trouble
[03:41:56.160 --> 03:42:02.400]  women children people that are just in bad circumstance there are ways through it
[03:42:04.480 --> 03:42:09.520]  but we need we need to meet people where they are individually and hold them either accountable
[03:42:09.520 --> 03:42:15.440]  or we need to lift them up in the way that human beings should lift each other uh in an appropriate
[03:42:15.440 --> 03:42:23.920]  way not accepting that here that is not accepting standards that are below what any of us would want
[03:42:23.920 --> 03:42:29.360]  in our households because if you want to provide a home for the homeless move one in with their
[03:42:29.360 --> 03:42:33.520]  mental illness and their alcoholism and their drug addiction that's not the answer and you'll
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:40.640]  soon realize it it's find a way for them and be the compassionate human being that we were born
[03:42:40.640 --> 03:42:46.960]  to be and rise into who we are so we can lift someone else up by meeting them where they this

[03:47:21.920 --> 03:47:32.160]  and welcome back to info wars dot com and you know i want to pick up kind of where i left off but
[03:47:32.160 --> 03:47:37.280]  i want to roll back a bit for my again talk for my own experience you know i had a an occasion
[03:47:37.280 --> 03:47:44.080]  where i was invited to speak at a conference and it was called um the environment and poverty and it
[03:47:44.080 --> 03:47:51.040]  was in uh istanbul turkey and it's like man i was 20 years ago it's a long time ago and i wrote a
[03:47:51.040 --> 03:47:57.120]  paper um by the same name called the environment and poverty this so happens and this particular
[03:47:57.120 --> 03:48:08.000]  group was the uh orthodox um it was uh martholomew uh who was the orthodox patriarch from istanbul
[03:48:08.000 --> 03:48:12.080]  one of five patriarchs for those that don't know the history of this you know and eight i think it
[03:48:12.080 --> 03:48:18.640]  was 1054 ad the catholic church and the eastern orthodox split um and there were essentially
[03:48:18.640 --> 03:48:25.600]  patriarchs in istanbul was the um like the lead guy uh first among equals they called them and
[03:48:25.600 --> 03:48:30.000]  there were five patriarchs scattered around the world i met them all at one point or another
[03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.640]  but they invited me to come to this conference um and i ended up presenting a paper there and
[03:48:34.640 --> 03:48:40.080]  doing a bunch of things um but the environment and poverty what was it what was what it was about
[03:48:40.080 --> 03:48:44.560]  and the concept that i was presenting was essentially bottom up you know you meet people
[03:48:44.560 --> 03:48:49.040]  where they are you don't impose your program on them you find out you know where they are
[03:48:49.040 --> 03:48:53.280]  and maybe you can do something maybe you can't but you know there's a different approach to
[03:48:54.480 --> 03:48:59.120]  how we deal with each other internationally and and it was pretty well accepted and i got a chance
[03:48:59.120 --> 03:49:06.800]  to do it actually to to actualize that paper in chicloon village a traditional tribal council
[03:49:06.800 --> 03:49:12.960]  and village nation within the nation here in alaska and i did that i was able to work with
[03:49:12.960 --> 03:49:18.960]  uh garry harrison chief harrison and a number of people in chiclin village for uh five years as
[03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:23.920]  their tribal administrator in the years their tribal planner and i want to talk about social
[03:49:23.920 --> 03:49:32.400]  services from a real perspective this is a multi-generational um impacted group by cultures
[03:49:32.400 --> 03:49:36.880]  collided you know so it's like fresh in everyone's memory you know people actually experienced it in
[03:49:36.880 --> 03:49:42.080]  the and i can tell you you know when you look at the face of homelessness and anchors a lot of it
[03:49:42.080 --> 03:49:48.320]  has native american faces on it because of that flash of culture and what i would call you know a
[03:49:48.320 --> 03:49:53.920]  post-traumatic stress syndrome from alcoholism drug abuse all of it but when you go back to
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:50:00.320]  chiclin village chiclin village in the early 1900s had 250 tribal citizens and then something else
[03:50:00.320 --> 03:50:06.960]  that was imported in those days it was the flu epidemic killed everyone but five sisters who
[03:50:06.960 --> 03:50:13.840]  then were to regrow the village back to about 250 today and that happened everywhere you know and i
[03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:20.720]  mean there were a lot of things that were really screwed up uh then um but the result is we have
[03:50:20.720 --> 03:50:26.720]  a lot of people that have been damaged by it and a certain level of responsibility you know goes with
[03:50:26.720 --> 03:50:33.440]  this um and alaska derives all of its revenue from rural sources which has always forgot you know
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:39.920]  it's oil gas minerals timber fish that have driven the economy here it's rural resources and rural
[03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:46.480]  people that have been impacted and so how we address that you know needs to recognize that and we
[03:50:46.480 --> 03:50:51.040]  tried you know we created an endowments we even had our university was a land-based university
[03:50:51.040 --> 03:50:55.440]  before we were a state because we had no revenue sources you know school districts performed here
[03:50:55.440 --> 03:50:59.920]  as the first form of government she had no way to fund schools you know when when public schools
[03:50:59.920 --> 03:51:08.800]  became in the 1920s something that was desirable um you know when you when you look at the impacts
[03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:16.000]  and what's happened then it begs for a solution not forgetting about it and forgetting the divinity
[03:51:16.000 --> 03:51:21.120]  of human beings in all of this ultimately you meet people where they are and then you and then
[03:51:21.120 --> 03:51:27.040]  you deal with that you know and in some cases it means an arrest you know in other cases it means
[03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:32.320]  rehab and in other cases it means skill building in other cases it means who knows what but we
[03:51:32.320 --> 03:51:36.880]  had a social service program that had some unique provisions that we were able to act
[03:51:37.440 --> 03:51:43.600]  within chiclin village very rapidly uh and and so one of my the only social service guy we had
[03:51:43.600 --> 03:51:50.720]  a time handled 1,100 cases in one year that's a lot of case management okay and he never had one
[03:51:50.720 --> 03:51:56.720]  we never had one complaint and we had a lot of the folks that he served volunteering in our
[03:51:56.720 --> 03:52:02.960]  programs and contributing time and effort because we found ways to make it work you know for instance
[03:52:02.960 --> 03:52:07.120]  i give a couple examples somebody's getting thrown out of their apartment because they don't have the
[03:52:07.120 --> 03:52:12.080]  safety shoes to go to work and their cars broke down but they got two kids and a wife and they're
[03:52:12.080 --> 03:52:17.280]  trying to make it and they're barely made what we would do as a village is instead of wait till
[03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:23.280]  they're on the street with all their possessions homeless now and now we have a 20,000 or 30,000
[03:52:23.280 --> 03:52:29.040]  dollar fix to get this family back on its feet and working again or we could intervene right
[03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:34.800]  then which is what we would do and we would go get the boots fix the car and then we would
[03:52:34.800 --> 03:52:39.920]  find out what took them into this place and could we build their skills could we do something to
[03:52:39.920 --> 03:52:44.400]  enhance their income potential or maybe it was just simply budgeting you know but what is it
[03:52:44.400 --> 03:52:48.640]  underlying the problem and how do we address it and for four or five hundred bucks we can keep
[03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:54.960]  person working and then fix the underlying problem so they would be more productive in their culture
[03:52:54.960 --> 03:53:00.880]  and in ours and and everyone benefited by that and and and there was dignity in that and there
[03:53:00.880 --> 03:53:06.880]  wasn't failure in that there was success in that and that's what every human being really desires
[03:53:06.880 --> 03:53:12.880]  and when they fall too far into mental illness or alcoholism or drug addiction then we have to
[03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:19.200]  address it differently if we're any kind of a passionate culture but it's to face the truth
[03:53:19.200 --> 03:53:27.040]  of it that people made bad choices and now they have to be responsible so it means arrest rehab
[03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:32.880]  and reform that's the objective and we have to address it not by giving up all of our rights as
[03:53:32.880 --> 03:53:39.760]  a culture and accepting to tolerance this idea that somehow this is good for people when in fact
[03:53:39.760 --> 03:53:48.640]  it's not it's it's worse for people it's abandonment of people it's throwing them to the wolves to be
[03:53:48.640 --> 03:53:54.720]  devoured by one another and that is not a civil society that I would like to be a part of and
[03:53:54.720 --> 03:54:02.640]  it's it's it's wearing on all of us who live now as far east as Austin because when you go to
[03:54:02.640 --> 03:54:09.360]  communities where this doesn't happen there's a reason and the underlying reason is they actually
[03:54:09.360 --> 03:54:15.680]  attack the underlying problem which is not homelessness it's drugs alcohol and the things
[03:54:15.680 --> 03:54:20.240]  that flow from it and in some cases it's really human misery that needs to be addressed it can be
[03:54:21.120 --> 03:54:30.000]  in a much more aggressive way so having said all that you know getting back to the war on the ground
[03:54:31.600 --> 03:54:37.680]  we have to have the opportunity to say this and and to come at this from a different angle
[03:54:37.680 --> 03:54:42.800]  and you know you hear about all this compassion and tolerance from the left and I don't see it
[03:54:44.480 --> 03:54:51.520]  we need to amplify that right now you know yep sometimes you got to be caught we got a president
[03:54:51.520 --> 03:54:58.640]  who maybe overdone it a little bit but you know what the job is getting done you know and sometimes
[03:54:58.640 --> 03:55:06.400]  it takes tough things and contrarian things to make things work that's why the voice of Alex Jones
[03:55:06.400 --> 03:55:12.400]  and all of us need to be heard now in this century facing the biggest problems of all
[03:55:12.960 --> 03:55:20.240]  it is about info wars it always has been about info wars and now more than ever because
[03:55:20.800 --> 03:55:29.280]  their solutions but they're coming from the right they're coming from a sense of responsibility
[03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:35.600]  accountability and values and that's what we need to find the common ground on again you know I
[03:55:35.600 --> 03:55:40.720]  think about I watched some of the videos you know and you have people doing these crazy things
[03:55:42.640 --> 03:55:49.120]  to make social points and to try and convince the public to accept things at a level of
[03:55:50.480 --> 03:55:56.640]  no the truth works it still works when we make mistakes we need to fix them rapidly because
[03:55:56.640 --> 03:56:03.040]  we do we all make them and we need to learn by them but more importantly we need to engage a
[03:56:03.040 --> 03:56:11.200]  dignified debate and make sure we have a fighting chance you know band videos is in fact probably
[03:56:11.200 --> 03:56:17.520]  going to be one of the most important alternative outlets out there in 2020 people need to let people
[03:56:17.520 --> 03:56:25.120]  know they need to support the info wars this network get involved spread the word do something
[03:56:25.120 --> 03:56:33.680]  that changes it a little bit and and do it with intention do it because you care about country
[03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:40.560]  you care about your family you care about your great great grandchildren and your adversaries
[03:56:41.120 --> 03:56:47.200]  great great grandchildren who none of us know right now but I guarantee you if you were an
[03:56:47.200 --> 03:56:53.440]  awake human soul you care about them and what we do today is going to matter for them today
[03:56:53.440 --> 03:57:03.200]  today right now engage the public engage this network support people that share common ideas I mean
[03:57:03.200 --> 03:57:08.720]  look at what walmart has just done you know they've abandoned the base of their consumers right
[03:57:08.720 --> 03:57:12.880]  they're not going to carry bullets in here in Alaska they quit carrying handguns we were the last
[03:57:12.880 --> 03:57:20.000]  state they still did it till this last week you know what support people that share your value
[03:57:20.000 --> 03:57:27.520]  you should support networks that share your values and support this one support alex hold him up in
