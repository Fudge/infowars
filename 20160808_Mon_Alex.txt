[00:00.000 --> 00:23.080]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23.080 --> 00:35.800]  Out of the hundreds of incredibly important stories I have lying before me today, the
[00:35.800 --> 00:39.760]  first one I want to cover opens the theme.
[00:39.760 --> 00:42.880]  I don't set the theme here daily.
[00:42.880 --> 00:48.880]  What is basically openly being thrown in our face is what sets the theme.
[00:48.880 --> 00:57.480]  We are in a completely game system, the stock market, the currency rates, the interest rates.
[00:57.480 --> 01:00.160]  I would have economic guests on.
[01:00.160 --> 01:05.680]  Many of them have been the top folks in their field, like Bob Chapman of the International
[01:05.680 --> 01:07.720]  Forecaster of the late great.
[01:07.720 --> 01:11.840]  And they would talk about how the markets were rigged specifically.
[01:11.840 --> 01:16.680]  And then it came out years later that exactly what he said and others talked about was totally
[01:16.680 --> 01:17.680]  true.
[01:17.680 --> 01:23.480]  The unemployment, they rig the numbers that come in on inflation.
[01:23.480 --> 01:28.320]  It's all rigged and it's getting more overtly rigged.
[01:28.320 --> 01:42.960]  Now, I got up this morning and saw the New York Times unveiling Alexa, an Amazon company
[01:42.960 --> 01:47.040]  that will control every device in your house for your convenience.
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.120]  It will be like Siri, but 2.0.
[01:51.120 --> 01:56.920]  And of course, they admit that they've merged, this is admitted, Amazon.com with the CIA
[01:56.920 --> 02:00.720]  and the NSA.
[02:00.720 --> 02:08.640]  And then on top of it, two years ago, in the middle of October, Alexa was mainly an internet
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.280]  traffic rating site and we could look at our Google Analytics and look at our own servers
[02:13.280 --> 02:16.320]  and see that it was pretty accurate.
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.400]  It would operate off people that basically had dashboards or visited Alexa, then it would
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.840]  put cookies on your computer to track where you went.
[02:26.840 --> 02:30.000]  And after we first reported on it, WorldNet Daily and others confirmed that thousands
[02:30.000 --> 02:35.400]  of libertarian and conservative sides, including DrudgeReport.com, had their ratings brought
[02:35.400 --> 02:38.720]  down 80% on one day.
[02:38.720 --> 02:48.760]  And it didn't even lazily, you know, just slowly where it's not noticeable lower us,
[02:48.760 --> 02:53.320]  they just did it overnight.
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.920]  Now we could sit there and we've shown people these graphs with our internal stats and Google
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.520]  programs and show our traffic exploding, but you can just see that in the news.
[03:03.520 --> 03:05.920]  You can see that in bumper stickers all over the country.
[03:05.920 --> 03:13.120]  You can see that with the late show talking trash about us and other major programs on
[03:13.120 --> 03:16.560]  a daily basis.
[03:16.560 --> 03:25.320]  But it's indicative of the total rigging of society and civilization.
[03:25.320 --> 03:30.720]  Now advertisers operate off of results, so it doesn't matter if the supposed major rating
[03:30.720 --> 03:35.520]  service is cooking everything because people know they're getting results.
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.800]  But this is what's crazy.
[03:37.800 --> 03:44.200]  They didn't just cut our visitors by 80% in one day and then never bring it back up.
[03:44.200 --> 03:53.880]  I mean, you see the spikes, but it's brought down into a valley.
[03:53.880 --> 04:01.840]  They then gave an 80% boost on average to every communist, socialist, or Democrat site.
[04:01.840 --> 04:09.880]  This criminal racketeering organized crime to direct the economy through a technocracy
[04:09.880 --> 04:16.960]  to socialist and communist and establishment Goldman Sachs approved type media outlets
[04:16.960 --> 04:19.420]  and websites and commerce sites.
[04:19.420 --> 04:23.920]  This is Amazon that wants to be over global commerce that's being rated all over the world
[04:23.920 --> 04:29.960]  as we speak from Japan to Germany for running trust, running monopolies, best buddies with
[04:29.960 --> 04:36.800]  Obama, and they're engaged in trying to create a monopoly here domestically, not just of
[04:36.800 --> 04:44.760]  products, but to literally defraud us and not let us get advertisers.
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.440]  Criminal assault.
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.960]  And the reason I bring up this theme is here's the next article, infowars.com, ABC cuts live
[04:52.960 --> 05:00.200]  stream when Trump starts talking about Hillary's support for ISIS systemwide.
[05:00.200 --> 05:03.480]  Hillary Clinton's homebrew email server, which was used to send classified U.S. government
[05:03.480 --> 05:08.000]  information may had led directly to the death of a scientist in Iran who provided intelligence
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000]  through the U.S.
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  I was reported by Steve Watson of infowars.com.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.520]  Last week, the Iranian government executed the scientist after charging him with treason
[05:15.520 --> 05:18.080]  for providing quote vital information to the enemy.
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.200]  The Iranians were apparently tipped off about the scientist ties to the CIA thanks to Hillary's
[05:22.200 --> 05:23.480]  unsecured server.
[05:23.480 --> 05:27.680]  After the former Secretary of State discussed his situation in plain text email and in response
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.560]  to the controversy, Senator Tom Cotton said Hillary's recklessness could have easily caused
[05:31.560 --> 05:32.560]  the death of the scientist.
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.960]  He said, quote, that goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to
[05:36.960 --> 05:40.240]  put that kind of highly classified information on a private server.
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.760]  And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe.
[05:43.760 --> 05:47.480]  And remember, Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied about sending classified information over
[05:47.480 --> 05:51.520]  her home email server and continued to suggest she never did such a thing.
[05:51.520 --> 05:55.320]  Even after the FBI investigation concluded that's exactly what she did.

[06:59.080 --> 07:01.760]  Dr. Grip, you developed living defense for us.
[07:01.760 --> 07:03.160]  It took you over a year to do it.
[07:03.160 --> 07:04.880]  Why is this so good?
[07:04.880 --> 07:09.360]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[07:09.360 --> 07:14.200]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[07:14.200 --> 07:15.200]  my system.
[07:15.200 --> 07:20.460]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[07:20.460 --> 07:23.240]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[07:23.240 --> 07:28.320]  Right now with all the refugees, spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[07:28.320 --> 07:29.560]  going on everywhere.
[07:29.560 --> 07:30.560]  These are all parasites.
[07:30.560 --> 07:33.280]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said that there's so many things that are in it.
[07:33.280 --> 07:34.520]  You have the neem in there.
[07:34.520 --> 07:37.600]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[07:37.600 --> 07:40.920]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[07:40.920 --> 07:41.920]  All right.
[07:41.920 --> 07:44.080]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[07:44.080 --> 07:45.240]  It just came back in yesterday.
[07:45.240 --> 07:46.240]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[07:46.240 --> 07:50.920]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[07:50.920 --> 07:54.200]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[07:54.200 --> 07:56.400]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[07:56.400 --> 08:06.480]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:06.480 --> 08:28.600]  Thank you, Dr. Group, for all your work, sir, on this great product, sir, on this great
[08:28.600 --> 08:29.600]  product.
[08:29.600 --> 08:45.720]  Thank you, Dr. Group, for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:45.720 --> 08:54.880]  Thank you, Dr. Group, for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[08:54.880 --> 09:03.680]  Thank you, sir, on this great product, sir, on this great product.
[09:03.680 --> 09:18.540]  Thank you, Dr. Group, for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[09:18.540 --> 09:24.100]  If you go read the press releases of the Bilderberg group, if you go read the
[09:24.100 --> 09:30.500]  press releases and statements, admission statements, of organizations like DeBose
[09:30.500 --> 09:35.860]  that is just a public Bilderberg group meeting, quasi-public, they tell you we
[09:35.860 --> 09:43.020]  are technocrats setting up a technocratic, technotronic world. The first person to
[09:43.020 --> 09:47.020]  call it that, well they had the technocrat movement back in the 20s and 30s,
[09:47.020 --> 09:52.060]  but the first person to call that modern times was Zbigniew Brzezinski. And he's
[09:52.060 --> 09:56.420]  one of the top global architects the last 50 years in this country and is
[09:56.420 --> 10:04.060]  still in charge to a great extent. I've read six of his books where he calmly
[10:04.060 --> 10:07.900]  talks about how he manipulated the Camaroos who should kill 30% of the
[10:07.900 --> 10:12.700]  Cambodian population. Now he's quite proud of that. He now makes statements at
[10:12.700 --> 10:16.060]  the Council on Foreign Relations that we played many times where he says it's
[10:16.060 --> 10:20.940]  easier just to wipe out the population now than to control them.
[10:22.660 --> 10:29.140]  Technocracies are gamed economies that take royalty to the next level. Under
[10:29.140 --> 10:35.940]  ancient hereditary royalty, the king is the law, the king is above the law, the
[10:35.940 --> 10:39.860]  king owns everything including the population. It's called feudalism, a
[10:39.860 --> 10:50.380]  fancy term for slavery. The best slaves don't know their slaves and they are
[10:50.380 --> 10:55.780]  dazzled by the fancy regalia and the banners and the horns and the big
[10:55.780 --> 11:02.300]  Clydesdale horses of the royalty and the Jewels. It must be their right to rule
[11:02.300 --> 11:09.180]  over us or they wouldn't be in power. The divine right of kings. Now that said,
[11:09.180 --> 11:16.740]  this new system has been established where the major hedge funds, JP Morgan,
[11:16.740 --> 11:21.340]  Goldman Sachs and others, now in the last three years were given global
[11:21.340 --> 11:30.300]  diplomatic immunity by the United Nations from all crime. They have established
[11:30.300 --> 11:36.260]  systems where they admit they rigged the stock market. 95% of the trades that
[11:36.260 --> 11:39.420]  mainstream news are completely rigged, totally fake. Just all computerized, all
[11:39.420 --> 11:45.860]  staged, like a fake casino. The currency rates globally totally staged every day.
[11:47.540 --> 11:54.060]  The insurance rates staged. The interest rates staged, all staged, all
[11:54.060 --> 11:59.140]  admitted to be staged. They've gone from a decade denying it to just yes, we
[11:59.140 --> 12:06.580]  staged everything. Now move along. The New York Times came out in an article
[12:06.580 --> 12:10.140]  yesterday. Billy Corgan sent me this this morning and said, have you seen this? And
[12:10.140 --> 12:15.460]  I said, no, but I've seen the same talking point 100 places last week. And
[12:15.460 --> 12:19.860]  it's, we need to go ahead and lie about Donald Trump. We need to go ahead and
[12:19.860 --> 12:24.020]  maybe take the election from him. The New York Times writer said a few months
[12:24.020 --> 12:27.140]  before that we need to just kill him. Somebody needs to put a bullet in him,
[12:27.140 --> 12:32.180]  he said. You read the article and it says, look, it's our moral duty to lie
[12:32.180 --> 12:37.860]  about Trump. We're liberals. And it's just something we have to do. Here it is.
[12:37.860 --> 12:45.500]  Amazon has big plans for Alexa running the Star Trek home. That's another
[12:45.500 --> 12:50.740]  New York Times article. And it's written like it's fun and it's cute. And it's
[12:50.740 --> 12:53.980]  going to be voice activated and run all your appliances and everything in your
[12:53.980 --> 13:08.580]  home. And it's called Alexa and the program is called Echo. Now it was the
[13:08.580 --> 13:15.100]  dream of Al Gore and Ken Lay in the early 1990s. They developed it in the late
[13:15.100 --> 13:18.340]  1980s, but when public in the early 1990s with a global carbon tax plan to
[13:18.340 --> 13:22.380]  control all life, track everything but selectively tax so you could shut down
[13:22.380 --> 13:29.580]  all competition. That's the real holy grail of this new royalty that's above
[13:29.580 --> 13:34.780]  the law. But by us using their computer systems, they're then able to gain the
[13:34.780 --> 13:38.660]  economy even more. And they talked about thermostats, smart meters in all your
[13:38.660 --> 13:42.860]  houses that would also monitor and run and control all your other appliances,
[13:42.860 --> 13:48.420]  even if you didn't like it. And they said as long as it's ubiquitous, our
[13:48.420 --> 13:54.820]  psychologists have found and already in all the homes, they will opt in to these
[13:54.820 --> 13:59.020]  systems. But even if they don't, the average person is so busy that they talk
[13:59.020 --> 14:02.140]  about us like they're Martians looking at us under a microscope, you know,
[14:02.140 --> 14:06.420]  planning to invade, like the intro of H.T. Wells' War of the Worlds. Not the movie
[14:06.420 --> 14:12.020]  but the book. They coldly from space watched us and prepared. And if you guys
[14:12.020 --> 14:17.380]  print me the intro to War of the Worlds because that's what it is. And I don't
[14:17.380 --> 14:21.180]  mean aliens, but the elite act just like it. And I'm just sitting here watching
[14:21.180 --> 14:27.740]  them build it all around us. Just like I told you 18 years ago that the new TVs
[14:27.740 --> 14:30.860]  and cable boxes had microphones and cameras and I would bust them open on
[14:30.860 --> 14:41.060]  television and show you. And then all hell would break loose days after. Death
[14:41.060 --> 14:45.260]  threats, attacks, hell on earth, whatever I would get to that. Because you
[14:45.260 --> 14:50.620]  weren't supposed to know at that point. Now CNN, your TV is watching you. Samsung
[14:50.620 --> 14:54.260]  TVs tell you, watch what you say, we're watching you and sell them the data right
[14:54.260 --> 15:02.100]  now. Whether it's AT&T or whether it's Samsung, whether it's a digital
[15:02.100 --> 15:08.340]  provider or the or the device itself, all of them are making money selling it
[15:08.340 --> 15:14.260]  into the grid. Now what am I getting at here? Because I've got all this other
[15:14.260 --> 15:18.380]  incredible news, but here's what's happening in 2016. Justice Matt Drudge was
[15:18.380 --> 15:22.740]  told a year ago by Supreme Court Justice just as he came here to warn us on
[15:22.740 --> 15:33.700]  air and no one else. This is the year they turn it all on. Two years ago,
[15:33.700 --> 15:39.460]  Alexa in one day delisted thousands of libertarian, conservative, Christian and
[15:39.460 --> 15:44.020]  veterans group and Second Amendment sites in one day. Alexa, the global rating
[15:44.020 --> 15:51.340]  service supposedly of internet traffic brought us down 80%. Now we went and
[15:51.340 --> 15:54.980]  showed on info wars.com article our internal Google track stats that are
[15:54.980 --> 16:05.380]  live. Not just some sampling that you know the Democrat Bezos puts out. Okay. And
[16:05.380 --> 16:08.620]  we were actually climbing at that point and so was basically all other
[16:08.620 --> 16:13.900]  libertarian conservative media while MSNBC, CNN, they were all dropping. So
[16:13.900 --> 16:20.260]  they didn't just drop us 80%. They lifted them 80%, sometimes 100%. So the
[16:20.260 --> 16:27.060]  graphs went like this. Globalist media straight up. Patriot media straight down.
[16:27.060 --> 16:31.420]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this has continued and intensified. Now in the
[16:31.420 --> 16:35.580]  real world, you see our bumper stickers everywhere. You see our links
[16:35.580 --> 16:42.140]  everywhere. You see the videos everywhere. You see all of this. So they have
[16:42.140 --> 16:48.580]  inversed these. MSNBC goes straight up. We go straight down. Now you notice,
[16:48.580 --> 16:51.100]  even though they cut us down, we still keep going up because we're growing so
[16:51.100 --> 16:57.220]  fast. They just sloppily turned us down 80%. But then if you look at a five-year
[16:57.220 --> 17:02.260]  graph, we've now climbed back up above that because we're really much many times
[17:02.260 --> 17:07.180]  higher than what they're even saying. But here's the next level. These are the
[17:07.180 --> 17:12.980]  people that are going to basically give you a device, but you just pay for the
[17:12.980 --> 17:18.580]  service. A little robot that sits in your house. It is an imperial probe droid. And
[17:18.580 --> 17:24.020]  it's jacking into everything, stealing everything and running your life. And you
[17:24.020 --> 17:27.900]  talk to it. It's your new family member. What a joke. I mean, you think it's
[17:27.900 --> 17:31.700]  bad with Zuckerberg calling his users dumb efforts or Drudge saying, you know,
[17:31.700 --> 17:34.980]  remember when we were still human, feel the air, you know, feel the water walking
[17:34.980 --> 17:38.780]  in the woods? Remember when it showed all his minions were in the goggles seated
[17:38.780 --> 17:43.860]  with virtual reality as he walks by them as the super predator? Remember that
[17:43.860 --> 17:50.900]  photo a few months ago? So it's across the board where Amazon is the biggest
[17:50.900 --> 17:57.580]  commerce site in the world, bigger than Walmart with overall sales, bigger than
[17:57.580 --> 18:03.380]  Walmart. And it's going to game everything and have a device in your house that
[18:03.380 --> 18:06.700]  runs and tracks everything that you talk to. That's like it's your husband or
[18:06.700 --> 18:13.220]  wife. And they're involved in monopoly and trust actions all over the world
[18:13.220 --> 18:18.300]  creating monopolies. And they're involved creating monopolies saying no one
[18:18.300 --> 18:21.220]  else is getting traffic they politically don't agree with. That's the equivalent
[18:21.220 --> 18:26.900]  of the Germans first in 1936, 37 closing Jewish shops. First you turn off the
[18:26.900 --> 18:32.420]  money of the people. Well, what Amazon and Zuckerberg and everybody's doing is
[18:32.420 --> 18:38.940]  direct siege economic warfare. Just like they won't give veterans groups or
[18:38.940 --> 18:43.060]  Christian groups or other charities 501c3s. They won't give one out but give
[18:43.060 --> 18:46.260]  Democrats tens of thousands a year. And then they go and they prosecute and
[18:46.260 --> 18:50.900]  persecute the other organizations that already had their tax exemptions. This is
[18:50.900 --> 18:55.380]  a dangerous dangerous dangerous reign of terror. And what I'm getting at here today
[18:55.380 --> 19:03.140]  I'm gonna skip this and we'll break is that the next phases are about to come
[19:03.140 --> 19:06.420]  into place. We've already seen them in Germany and seen them in France and seen
[19:06.420 --> 19:11.580]  them in China where they are quote banning internet news period in China.
[19:11.580 --> 19:16.860]  Even banning mainstream news online. That was the headline last week. China bans
[19:16.860 --> 19:22.540]  news online. And who works with them? Who's learning from them? Zuckerberg.
[19:22.540 --> 19:30.620]  Apple is one of the worst. Google I believe is even more evil but understands
[19:30.620 --> 19:33.700]  they need to stay free and open longer because that's what really dominates.
[19:33.700 --> 19:37.940]  And so they are still to a certain extent more free and more open except for
[19:37.940 --> 19:41.500]  with the Trump stuff censoring his name not listing him as a presidential
[19:41.500 --> 19:45.820]  candidate trying to block things. There's Bloomberg China bans internet news
[19:45.820 --> 19:50.780]  reporting as media crackdown widens. Now that's already started in Europe but
[19:50.780 --> 19:53.700]  it's just called political correctness where they arrest you if you mildly
[19:53.700 --> 20:00.980]  criticize open borders. This is draconian. And so this is the internet
[20:00.980 --> 20:06.660]  ghettos. Now the good news is info or saw this coming four years ago and
[20:06.660 --> 20:13.060]  shifted from being subscriber based advertising based and private sales
[20:13.060 --> 20:18.100]  based by us to moving more and more to private sales. And that's why we were
[20:18.100 --> 20:21.100]  able to continue on everybody else is struggling even as their traffic goes
[20:21.100 --> 20:28.220]  up they're turning off the old online system of quote clickbait and most
[20:28.220 --> 20:31.980]  organizations are so bare bones they don't know how to do other forms of
[20:31.980 --> 20:39.820]  advertising and other systems. I mean it's dinosaur level. If I was running
[20:39.820 --> 20:44.740]  Clear Channel and by the way I've done I don't get into inside baseball but I did
[20:44.740 --> 20:51.700]  as a test with a large Clear Channel outlet. We did a test and with my
[20:51.700 --> 21:02.820]  tweaking it brought up an ad campaigns program three thousand percent. Now you'd
[21:02.820 --> 21:09.180]  think Clear Channel would want that type of consulting. What I'm saying is it's
[21:09.180 --> 21:13.620]  like the executives everywhere are zombies too now it's not just the public. I
[21:13.620 --> 21:18.020]  mean with only a hundred and seventy something affiliates most of them mom and
[21:18.020 --> 21:21.220]  pops and and the rest of we have built something nobody else has even got.
[21:21.220 --> 21:27.020]  Imagine if I had 600 radio stations the Big Mar keys if I had 20 of the top
[21:27.020 --> 21:31.260]  stations in the country we take the whole country back. But see it isn't about a
[21:31.260 --> 21:35.300]  level playing field it's about controlling everything. And so what I'm
[21:35.300 --> 21:40.660]  getting in here is they're not gonna stop. Oh my gosh a couple years ago they
[21:40.660 --> 21:47.380]  the major third-party site run by Amazon alexa.com that yes we use for
[21:47.380 --> 21:52.540]  advertising sales for more than 15 years to say oh you claim your Google
[21:52.540 --> 21:55.020]  Analytics show you've got this many things sure you shouldn't it's a
[21:55.020 --> 22:01.460]  screenshot. Well Alexa oh wow wow you're like number 400 in the country and I see
[22:01.460 --> 22:06.340]  in places like England you're like number 55 and wow and that's incredible
[22:06.340 --> 22:12.460]  wow as we start climbing I mean by now we'd be like a hundred or something what
[22:12.460 --> 22:17.940]  do they do? They just de-list us and say it doesn't exist. The problem is we're
[22:17.940 --> 22:26.940]  still rampaging forward growing like the blob in their eyes. So they pretend
[22:26.940 --> 22:30.740]  to play this game if I saw one I saw five thousand and I'm not kidding I saw
[22:30.740 --> 22:34.860]  articles every day for years saying drudges of pathetic drudges collapse
[22:34.860 --> 22:39.060]  drudge doesn't have any traffic drudge isn't pertinent drudge doesn't matter
[22:39.060 --> 22:43.980]  anymore no one visits drudge drudge is a joke drudge is a fraud and of course
[22:43.980 --> 22:45.980]  drudge was just growing growing growing growing growing growing the number one
[22:45.980 --> 22:52.460]  news aggregator more than New York Times Facebook and NBC News and all of them
[22:52.460 --> 23:01.180]  combined and it's like two people who are just populist so how do they deal with
[23:01.180 --> 23:03.340]  that they're gonna come in with the federal elections commission they're
[23:03.340 --> 23:06.020]  openly saying they want to go out for drugs and everybody else they're gonna
[23:06.020 --> 23:09.660]  go in and just start not getting you passed through they're gonna they're
[23:09.660 --> 23:13.940]  quietly ending that neutrality to many sites where your site just is slow and
[23:13.940 --> 23:18.580]  people can't get to it they're announcing they're doing that it's a whole
[23:18.580 --> 23:21.900]  cocktail but I'm just telling you you want to live in a banana republic
[23:21.900 --> 23:26.660]  completely rigged baby this is it and then now they're gonna have a little
[23:26.660 --> 23:33.060]  foot tall round tubular robot that's what it is that red eyes you would put it
[23:33.060 --> 23:36.060]  in your house that's a little a little little tube over there in the corner
[23:36.060 --> 23:39.340]  it's like if aliens arrived and said here's this great technology you're
[23:39.340 --> 23:43.500]  taking oh thank you and it's a Trojan horse in your house to game and to
[23:43.500 --> 23:47.740]  track everything you do into actuary a profile on you and then shell that data
[23:47.740 --> 23:54.220]  and then figure out how to screw you better that's all admitted they admit
[23:54.220 --> 24:01.500]  it's about screwing you and sure we still stuff on Amazon and I I really
[24:01.500 --> 24:07.060]  think that I need to go follow lawsuits somebody's got to do it for any trust and
[24:07.060 --> 24:12.700]  point out what Amazon's doing on every end undercutting everybody to agree that's
[24:12.700 --> 24:19.780]  not even free market controlling the internet delisting people and implying
[24:19.780 --> 24:24.020]  they don't have traffic to destroy them it's the equivalent of staring out front
[24:24.020 --> 24:28.540]  somebody's restaurant that's been around 20 years and it's the most popular in
[24:28.540 --> 24:32.500]  town you're about to open yours down the street you go my son died of food
[24:32.500 --> 24:36.740]  poisoning in there and there's roaches as big as Chihuahuas and then going in
[24:36.740 --> 24:40.980]  there at night and throwing roach crap in the refrigerator and on the tables
[24:40.980 --> 24:53.340]  this is sabotage I mean this is hardcore 21st century warfare you know
[24:53.340 --> 24:56.180]  Trump's gonna contest the election if they steal it and he would have had the
[24:56.180 --> 25:03.900]  votes to get into the White House if Scalia hadn't died now he doesn't what
[25:03.900 --> 25:07.180]  I'm telling you is guys can you queue up the State Department clip and give me
[25:07.180 --> 25:10.500]  the article on that they have the head spokesman of the State Department is
[25:10.500 --> 25:15.940]  bringing the article I thanks they met a joke about well we hear about you have
[25:15.940 --> 25:20.020]  all this new transparency and he goes all the reporters together because
[25:20.020 --> 25:22.780]  they're all arrogant they're all gonna go get drunk together that you know that
[25:22.780 --> 25:29.180]  night they're all gonna go party together and it's just like Gibbs where
[25:29.180 --> 25:35.220]  he's just sitting there laughing the whole time remember the press secretary
[25:35.220 --> 25:39.860]  Obama's first press secretary was in there three years he said listen we were
[25:39.860 --> 25:44.220]  told to go on TV and said that there isn't a drone program and that's five
[25:44.220 --> 25:48.340]  years after it's operating and it's killed thousands of people and this is a
[25:48.340 --> 25:52.980]  program admitted to exist but but but let's go back this is the psychopathic
[25:52.980 --> 25:57.540]  sociopathic criminals celebrating like when a psycho calls the cops and says I
[25:57.540 --> 26:01.460]  just killed another little girl there's nothing you can do it's in there it's in
[26:01.460 --> 26:06.700]  their DNA let's go back to the article video State Department spokesman laughs
[26:06.700 --> 26:10.660]  at mention of transparency and democracy and so does the press keeping
[26:10.660 --> 26:14.980]  public informed literally a running joke to government elite and they do this
[26:14.980 --> 26:20.460]  all the time you think this little smart mouth weasel yes man would actually
[26:20.460 --> 26:24.580]  build something you think that guy'll take care of his kids at 2 a.m. when they
[26:24.580 --> 26:28.940]  got the flu you think that guy would stand up for his wife if somebody did
[26:28.940 --> 26:32.580]  something to him in a parking lot you think these type of people are who we
[26:32.580 --> 26:37.820]  need around huh and running things dishonorable powers little smart mouth
[26:37.820 --> 26:42.540]  frat boy bastards I'm gonna play the clip coming up this is in a special report
[26:42.540 --> 26:45.900]  I'm in a year that if you make this go viral this is another cough in the
[26:45.900 --> 26:48.980]  middle of the enemy just like I told you you make that emergency message to
[26:48.980 --> 26:52.700]  Trump go viral he'll put election fraud front and center he did it less than 48
[26:52.700 --> 27:00.540]  hours later Obama slipped up and basically revealed the secret election
[27:00.540 --> 27:05.700]  system that has been announcing elections since 1960s and we're going to
[27:05.700 --> 27:10.740]  expose it coming up the next segment the special report I shot last night up on
[27:10.740 --> 27:14.140]  info wars.com it's up on prisonplanet.com but dealing with all this
[27:14.140 --> 27:20.980]  rigging almost every time Trump talks about we will not surrender to the
[27:20.980 --> 27:25.780]  Chinese government and Hillary's an agent they don't just cut the TV feeds
[27:25.780 --> 27:32.980]  on Fox CNN MSNBC they kill internet feeds and folks when I saw the young
[27:32.980 --> 27:37.980]  Turks and went up on the little side stage at media robe and they blew up and
[27:37.980 --> 27:40.260]  spit in my face and threatened to physically attack me when one of their
[27:40.260 --> 27:43.700]  people had directed me up it was a set up
[27:44.540 --> 27:51.260]  within one hour YouTube that's who they work for had pulled the videos it was
[27:51.260 --> 27:55.780]  only because we had other sites to put them on to show what they'd done that
[27:55.780 --> 28:02.420]  they had to back off I walk around this office up here in the afternoon at night
[28:02.420 --> 28:05.780]  when Trump's giving a speech the audio will be on and I'll hear him start
[28:05.780 --> 28:09.780]  talking as I'm getting a cup of coffee or water and he'll go and crooked Hillary
[28:09.780 --> 28:15.100]  she's an agent and I go it's gonna cut see we don't even see this is how they
[28:15.100 --> 28:18.820]  overwhelm you with the technocracy because I'm just like so tired and just so
[28:18.820 --> 28:22.260]  used to it I just go hey they just cut his feet again but thank God other people
[28:22.260 --> 28:27.820]  are catching it we're living in 1984 where I just just expect oh they're gonna
[28:27.820 --> 28:32.900]  cut that I mean I know when they're gonna cut the feeds now this is a tech I
[28:32.900 --> 28:39.300]  have had them literally do it to me on YouTube because it was the YouTube stage
[28:39.300 --> 28:46.260]  that the young Turks were on video ABC cuts live stream when Trump starts
[28:46.260 --> 28:49.740]  talking about Hillary's support for ISIS but first let's play the State
[28:49.740 --> 28:54.620]  Department head spokesman making a big enjoyable joke because it's it's fun
[28:54.620 --> 29:00.100]  look they don't want to just piss on us they're gonna rub it in baby here it

[29:52.540 --> 29:57.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:57.740 --> 30:03.660]  video from Donald Trump speech Daytona Beach last week shows ABC news cutting
[30:03.660 --> 30:06.660]  the live feed as Trump begins to talk about Hillary Clinton's connections to
[30:06.660 --> 30:11.540]  ISIS as reported by Paul Joseph Watson of infoworse.com before the feed was cut
[30:11.540 --> 30:15.100]  Trump said quote take a look at Lando take a look at San Bernardino take a
[30:15.100 --> 30:18.540]  look at the World Trade Center and we let ISIS take this position it was
[30:18.540 --> 30:22.420]  Hillary Clinton that you should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS
[30:22.420 --> 30:25.980]  and right after Trump made that statement ABC news cut the feed and went
[30:25.980 --> 30:29.740]  to background music ABC isn't the only network to cut the feed with someone's
[30:29.740 --> 30:33.140]  critical of Hillary last month for example CNN cut its own feed when a
[30:33.140 --> 30:36.900]  reporter pointed out that Hillary's support for anti-crime legislation in
[30:36.900 --> 30:41.580]  the 90s led to mass incarceration of African Americans and Hillary supported
[30:41.580 --> 30:44.380]  jihadists in the Middle East particularly in Libya and Syria while
[30:44.380 --> 30:48.140]  serving as Secretary of State has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of
[30:48.140 --> 30:51.380]  thousands of Muslims the fact the mainstream media keep downplaying while
[30:51.380 --> 30:56.340]  claiming Trump is quote Islamophobic and to find out more visit infoworse.com

[34:15.940 --> 34:23.460]  economic warfare and every form of criminal activity you can imagine it is
[34:23.460 --> 34:26.820]  imperative to completely pull out of Amazon and all these major systems at
[34:26.820 --> 34:34.340]  this point I'd always believe being part of them would give us influence and that
[34:34.340 --> 34:37.220]  with that because they created these monopolies we could get involved in
[34:37.220 --> 34:42.060]  those to basically sap funding out of the globalist which we've done
[34:42.060 --> 34:49.220]  successfully but now it's reaching economic warfare level and they're not
[34:49.220 --> 34:53.580]  hurting us they're not stopping us but they are hurting a lot of other people
[34:53.580 --> 35:02.780]  that didn't think ahead to stop it and this is only a shade of things to come
[35:02.780 --> 35:09.220]  but it's already ultra intense ultra illegal and they're just doing just like
[35:09.220 --> 35:13.740]  it came out Nielsen was giving CNN and MSNBC fake ratings for a decade no one
[35:13.740 --> 35:17.580]  got in trouble they were just ripping off advertisers fake ratings you got a
[35:17.580 --> 35:21.900]  hundred thousand viewers two hundred thousand you people are a joke and they
[35:21.900 --> 35:24.660]  know it they know they're a joke they know they're criminal so now they're
[35:24.660 --> 35:27.500]  going for broke and all they've got is their snickering hatred and their
[35:27.500 --> 35:32.140]  snickering ignorance and the New York Times comes out and says it's time to
[35:32.140 --> 35:38.980]  lie to everybody they're now moralizing that lying is good and wanting to kill
[35:38.980 --> 35:42.940]  Trump is good I mean I've got the articles here before I go any further
[35:42.940 --> 35:47.100]  and show you the censored info with Trump it's the last chance for free

[36:45.140 --> 36:48.820]  these are great items at very low prices that are game changers they don't
[36:48.820 --> 36:54.980]  want you to have good iodine in your body go research the iodine conspiracy but
[36:54.980 --> 36:58.460]  what I'm getting at here is it's so obvious with the tip of the spear it's
[36:58.460 --> 37:02.420]  so obvious that free independent media is under attack everywhere and we're
[37:02.420 --> 37:05.420]  kicking their butt because you've been supporting us at the grassroots and
[37:05.420 --> 37:16.140]  circumventing their technocracy we built our rag tag system I am here pouring
[37:16.140 --> 37:20.060]  everything I can into this with the wonderful crew we've got and I'm
[37:20.060 --> 37:27.700]  watching either people awaken around the world around the country but I'm also
[37:27.700 --> 37:37.740]  watching other people basically turn into zombies now before I go any further
[37:37.740 --> 37:45.580]  it just comes down to this excuse me I said something here I just print it
[37:45.580 --> 37:55.100]  wherever you get a chance thanks all the stability we've seen so far is going
[37:55.100 --> 37:58.500]  to be disappearing world governments here and it's here to wreck the planet and
[37:58.500 --> 38:02.540]  bring in hell on earth and consolidate control while the globalists are in
[38:02.540 --> 38:18.900]  their armored safe zones and it is so important for everyone to understand
[38:18.900 --> 38:30.300]  that this is not a game this is not a joke this is not a drill this is not my
[38:30.300 --> 38:41.420]  opinion this is the reality of what we face as a civilization and we have a
[38:41.420 --> 38:48.780]  bunch of bullying we have a bunch of intimidation going on against humanity
[38:48.780 --> 38:54.780]  right now and I'm telling you I've studied other tyrannies thank you I have
[38:54.780 --> 39:04.060]  studied their mindsets what makes them tick and this turning we're facing is
[39:04.060 --> 39:11.820]  the most horrible wicked evil group the earth has ever faced they want to
[39:11.820 --> 39:19.260]  vandalize the entire earth they want to mutate and and and destroy life itself
[39:19.260 --> 39:25.060]  they are a wrecking crew from hell and anyone with discernment anyone that has
[39:25.060 --> 39:28.940]  any spirit left in them knows that a lot of people I know are falling to TV and
[39:28.940 --> 39:32.180]  video games and fantasy land it's designed to do that they're in during
[39:32.180 --> 39:35.660]  trance states you you're not gonna be able to probably reach those people you
[39:35.660 --> 39:38.300]  need to reach people who aren't in the trance state who aren't under the great
[39:38.300 --> 39:45.740]  illusion first and hopefully get them to become aware of it so that they don't
[39:45.740 --> 39:50.540]  fall under its spell and believe me if you're not under its spell you are only
[39:50.540 --> 39:54.140]  going to intensify your your understanding and your awakening there's a
[39:54.140 --> 40:00.620]  reason they're trying to put people into this artificial sleep state and this
[40:00.620 --> 40:05.580]  isn't from some short story written in the 1950s which was turned into the
[40:05.580 --> 40:09.140]  movie they live where our signals not strong enough we're cutting through to
[40:09.140 --> 40:13.620]  you that even though they're putting you in a near-sleep trance with the signal
[40:13.620 --> 40:18.780]  our signals not strong enough to block it you see that it's an allegory in a
[40:18.780 --> 40:23.940]  movie it's not an allegory by the 50s they had flicker rates and and and
[40:23.940 --> 40:30.540]  systems that could put someone who's suggestible into a trance state you
[40:30.540 --> 40:33.820]  look you walk by the kids watching TV they're drooling they're in a trance
[40:33.820 --> 40:40.180]  state medically more and more people are in a trance state and they're all got
[40:40.180 --> 40:46.140]  their virtual reality goggles on shitting there mutating down into a
[40:46.140 --> 40:53.540]  blob while Zuckerberg walks the bipedal predator past his minions that he has
[40:53.540 --> 41:02.340]  literally brought into his own universe and they're taking us there so that we
[41:02.340 --> 41:07.380]  will accept the horrors of what's gonna happen here in this third dimension this
[41:07.380 --> 41:11.660]  is a evil plan and boy let me tell you folks we need to be fighting it with
[41:11.660 --> 41:16.300]  every scrap of our bodies if you're not sending our articles out or if you're
[41:16.300 --> 41:20.100]  not taking my analysis and here's really what I don't have I don't have the
[41:20.100 --> 41:25.500]  funds I don't have the crew I don't have the wherewithal to actually take what I
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.940]  say on air and put it into daily articles and then link to the points I'm
[41:29.940 --> 41:35.060]  making in kind of data briefings to the world that's what Paul Watson 17 years
[41:35.060 --> 41:39.420]  ago he would do on his own website and I noticed he would give us credit it was
[41:39.420 --> 41:42.180]  basically transcripts of what I had to say and then he would go and actually
[41:42.180 --> 41:46.660]  find the links and I said hey why don't you just work with me
[41:47.500 --> 41:53.980]  you're just as important as we are folks and to yuppies and trendies and other
[41:53.980 --> 41:57.900]  people that hear this show for the first time and think it's a joke listen
[41:57.900 --> 42:03.900]  this isn't a joke okay if you think Amazon's gonna stop blocking Patriot
[42:03.900 --> 42:09.300]  libertarian conservative and Christian websites and stores and delisting them
[42:09.300 --> 42:14.220]  and saying they don't have traffic with fraudulent information to bankrupt an
[42:14.220 --> 42:18.060]  entire class and group of people don't you understand they're coming for you
[42:18.060 --> 42:27.140]  next one of the biggest blind spots in this country and in this world is that
[42:27.140 --> 42:32.620]  people think of themselves very selfishly like it's a shield and they go well
[42:32.620 --> 42:39.860]  I don't care if they put a big tax on you know say that the local highway I
[42:39.860 --> 42:46.580]  don't have a car all those expenses are gonna be passed on to you stupid
[42:50.420 --> 42:54.180]  people don't understand well I don't own coal stocks why do I care if they've
[42:54.180 --> 42:58.140]  doubled prices because that doubles the general price of electricity and then
[42:58.140 --> 43:01.220]  the society crumbles and then when other countries are able to have cheaper
[43:01.220 --> 43:05.540]  electricity by global design we shut down
[43:06.740 --> 43:10.220]  now I'm gonna play these two clips because this is the censored one from ABC
[43:10.220 --> 43:14.540]  news the stories up on info wars calm and then we have the clip of what they
[43:14.540 --> 43:18.140]  actually censored ABC cuts live stream when Trump starts talking about Hillary's
[43:18.140 --> 43:21.860]  support for ISIS you know he says she's the founder of ISIS here's where they
[43:21.860 --> 43:27.220]  censored take a look at Orlando take a look at San Bernardino take a look at
[43:27.220 --> 43:32.500]  the World Trade Center take a look at what's going on and then worldwide and
[43:32.500 --> 43:40.060]  we let ISIS take this position it was Hillary Clinton that she should get an
[43:40.060 --> 43:47.700]  award from them as the founder of ISIS that's what oh oh ABC's cut out right
[43:47.700 --> 43:53.820]  there now let's go ahead and show what he actually said before they started
[43:53.820 --> 43:58.700]  censoring and here it is take a look at Orlando take a look at San Bernardino
[43:58.700 --> 44:03.380]  take a look at the World Trade Center go to Africa look at what's going on and
[44:03.380 --> 44:11.300]  then worldwide and we let ISIS take this position it was Hillary Clinton that
[44:11.300 --> 44:18.100]  she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS that's what it was that's
[44:18.100 --> 44:25.580]  what it was her weakness her weak that's good now I want to go ahead and go to
[44:25.580 --> 44:30.740]  this special report that's on info wars calm that needs to go absolutely total
[44:30.740 --> 44:39.220]  viral it's titled Obama slips up reveals secret group controlling elections it's
[44:39.220 --> 44:42.820]  on info wars calm I'm going to have it red-linked I'm gonna put it back to the
[44:42.820 --> 44:47.020]  top of info wars calm Facebook Twitter you name it this needs to have maximum
[44:47.020 --> 44:51.060]  push and I've got another report Donald Trump if you look at actual social
[44:51.060 --> 44:54.460]  media numbers is gonna totally dominate Hillary with a landslide unless she
[44:54.460 --> 45:00.580]  steals it here is a key report of course the elections will not be raked what
[45:00.580 --> 45:07.460]  does that mean if mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory
[45:07.460 --> 45:20.140]  that is being propagated across the country including in places like Texas
[45:20.980 --> 45:28.620]  where typically it's not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths that's
[45:28.620 --> 45:31.660]  ridiculous that doesn't make any sense and I don't think anybody would take that
[45:31.660 --> 45:37.780]  seriously that was president Obama at a Pentagon press briefing last Thursday
[45:37.780 --> 45:42.940]  before he went to Martha's venue to play his 300th round of golf there since
[45:42.940 --> 45:47.860]  he's been president and he thinks you're off playing golf mentally because
[45:47.860 --> 45:53.620]  anyone who has any basic memory anyone that pays attention to what's happened
[45:53.620 --> 45:57.940]  not to share in the United States but all over the world knows that election
[45:57.940 --> 46:03.020]  fraud from the highest levels is commonplace and that there are hundreds
[46:03.020 --> 46:06.940]  of documented instances in this country's history now that's just
[46:06.940 --> 46:12.460]  establishment election fraud voter fraud goes on by the millions every two
[46:12.460 --> 46:18.260]  years that's been confirmed so Obama gets up there and says election fraud
[46:18.260 --> 46:22.820]  what's that it's like when Hillary was before the Senate committee and they
[46:22.820 --> 46:27.180]  said what about the Turkish ambassador in Benghazi she goes turkeys turkeys
[46:27.180 --> 46:31.420]  thinking the public wouldn't know about the country of Turkey instead would have
[46:31.420 --> 46:37.180]  thought of a ground foraging bird that we eat on Thanksgiving now here at
[46:37.180 --> 46:41.740]  info wars we're gonna be chronicling every single day in the next 90 days till
[46:41.740 --> 46:46.780]  the election what's really happening and we're gonna break down the facts of
[46:46.780 --> 46:53.580]  what's unfolding but before I get into who actually counts the votes here
[46:53.580 --> 46:59.500]  because Obama slipped up when he said oh if Trump's 15 points ahead and polls
[46:59.500 --> 47:05.060]  but then doesn't win then I'll be suspicious he knows good and damn well
[47:05.060 --> 47:08.540]  that the polls themselves are fixed and I'm gonna get to that in a moment but
[47:08.540 --> 47:15.980]  first I want to look at what he said in the transcript of his speech now there
[47:15.980 --> 47:20.740]  are five lies just in these four paragraphs but I'm just gonna focus on
[47:20.740 --> 47:24.420]  two for the sake of brevity this is this is from the transcript of what
[47:24.420 --> 47:29.220]  president Obama said if mr. Trump is suggesting that there's a conspiracy
[47:29.220 --> 47:36.540]  theory that is propagated across the country including in places like Texas
[47:36.540 --> 47:41.180]  where typically it is not Democrats who are in charge of voting booths that's
[47:41.180 --> 47:45.780]  ridiculous that doesn't make sense we're talking about a national election we're
[47:45.780 --> 47:50.700]  talking about theft of battleground states like Ohio and Florida that are
[47:50.700 --> 47:58.140]  continually being stolen by both sides we're not talking about places like
[47:58.140 --> 48:04.180]  Oregon or places like Texas Oregon going for Democrats Texas going for
[48:04.180 --> 48:08.500]  Republicans historically but see he builds a strong in oh we hear this
[48:08.500 --> 48:12.460]  conspiracy theory out of Texas that's how they always refer to us the Texan
[48:12.460 --> 48:15.900]  or the Texas conspiracy theory oh you know we know Trump's listening to that
[48:15.900 --> 48:21.660]  guy so oh what you think we're gonna steal Texas why Republicans run Texas
[48:21.660 --> 48:27.380]  how preposterous so he builds a strong in then he goes on and this is the key
[48:27.380 --> 48:32.180]  to say if mr. Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and he ends up
[48:32.180 --> 48:36.780]  losing then you know maybe he can raise some questions Obama said that doesn't
[48:36.780 --> 48:42.100]  seem to be the case at the moment Obama has really stepped in it thanks to
[48:42.100 --> 48:45.340]  Trump coming out and exposing the fact that they tried to rig the primaries
[48:45.340 --> 48:49.820]  against him and did steal the primary from Bernie Sanders Obama has been
[48:49.820 --> 48:54.660]  forced to come out and respond to this and in doing so he screwed up did you
[48:54.660 --> 49:01.020]  catch it he said oh don't worry Hillary's ahead in the polls and look
[49:01.020 --> 49:06.660]  we're gonna go off those polls come election day what he didn't tell you was
[49:06.660 --> 49:11.420]  two-fold he didn't tell you that Reuters and AP are part of the super secret
[49:11.420 --> 49:16.500]  private consortium that announces who the winner is nationwide it's been a
[49:16.500 --> 49:20.660]  controversy every election for decades we're gonna get to that moment and he
[49:20.660 --> 49:25.940]  didn't tell you that they've changed the methodology since Trump got way ahead
[49:25.940 --> 49:34.580]  in the polls to sample 10 to 15 percent more Democrats in a poll than
[49:34.580 --> 49:40.860]  Republicans putting Hillary 10 to 15 points ahead fraudulently and what a lot
[49:40.860 --> 49:46.540]  of top pollsters have called criminal fraud absolute malfeasance so let's
[49:46.540 --> 49:51.940]  look at some of those poll numbers here's an example from Reuters own website
[49:51.940 --> 49:56.820]  where they conducted polls July 16th to July 20th with the new methodology they
[49:56.820 --> 50:03.260]  are still continuing with 650 Democrats versus 496 Republicans then they've
[50:03.260 --> 50:07.500]  been caught also skewing so-called independence 196 mainly picking quote
[50:07.500 --> 50:12.060]  Democrats and progressives then they're able to give you the number of Hillary
[50:12.060 --> 50:15.580]  Clinton seven to ten points ahead and they're continuing to use this
[50:15.580 --> 50:20.060]  methodology something they've never done before but despite that if you fast
[50:20.060 --> 50:25.620]  forward to now in early August zero hedge breaks down and links directly to
[50:25.620 --> 50:31.100]  Reuters where suddenly her 10-point lead has shrunk to three points or has
[50:31.100 --> 50:35.860]  evaporated in some of their other polls despite the fraudulent methodology of
[50:35.860 --> 50:40.660]  adding 10 to 15 percentage points to Hillary by sampling knowing Democrats
[50:40.660 --> 50:46.420]  are gonna go for her she still has zero to 3% lead that gives Trump a 10 to 12
[50:46.420 --> 50:50.740]  percent lead and don't forget there's a lot of closeted voters out there that
[50:50.740 --> 50:53.740]  are just populace who want change a lot of Sanders voters who know they were
[50:53.740 --> 50:57.420]  robbed who are scared to say they're voting for Trump but are planning to
[50:57.420 --> 51:03.740]  vote for Trump now let's look at the most important information yet Breitbart
[51:03.740 --> 51:09.020]  is reporting on numbers that anybody can compile for themselves that gateway
[51:09.020 --> 51:13.140]  pundit put together these are public numbers these are crowd sourcing and
[51:13.140 --> 51:17.540]  whether it's Facebook whether it's Twitter you name it Trump has three four
[51:17.540 --> 51:23.660]  five times the positive reviews and the support that Hillary does and that's
[51:23.660 --> 51:27.740]  what we see on the streets of America we can't find Hillary signs or Hillary
[51:27.740 --> 51:32.180]  stickers we did exit polls ourselves in California and eight out of ten people
[51:32.180 --> 51:38.780]  were supporting Sanders over Hillary but see don't forget AP we're getting to
[51:38.780 --> 51:43.580]  that right now met the day before with the super delegates at a rich donors
[51:43.580 --> 51:47.180]  house with Hillary and the super delegates said we're going for Hillary
[51:47.180 --> 51:52.140]  regardless so that's when AP admits they quote called it for Hillary and then
[51:52.140 --> 51:57.700]  AP itself part of the secretive organization then the next day announced
[51:57.700 --> 52:01.980]  the winners at about eight o'clock at night and they did it arrogantly right
[52:01.980 --> 52:06.540]  out in plain view why because the bigger the fraud the more you have to act
[52:06.540 --> 52:11.700]  like what you're doing is completely normal now it's very important to note
[52:11.700 --> 52:15.740]  I have interviewed the late great collier brothers I have interviewed Bev
[52:15.740 --> 52:19.740]  Harris who made the documentary hacking democracy for HBO I have interviewed
[52:19.740 --> 52:26.340]  hundreds of experts mathematicians statisticians a diaboled chief
[52:26.340 --> 52:29.180]  engineers that have testified to legislators in Congress they were
[52:29.180 --> 52:33.860]  ordered to engage in fraud this is bipartisan so when Obama denies all
[52:33.860 --> 52:39.460]  this is going on this is admitted fact you know about black box voting fraud
[52:39.460 --> 52:43.220]  everybody's seen in the news again it's like he's denying something that
[52:43.220 --> 52:47.820]  everybody knows exist but what the public's not aware of is how they do it
[52:47.820 --> 52:52.420]  now they can steal the election at the local area with hacking they can stop
[52:52.420 --> 52:56.540]  the ballot boxes and that certainly goes on but the way it's really done is in
[52:56.540 --> 53:02.180]  close battleground states you simply have the news announce hours before the
[53:02.180 --> 53:06.580]  polls close that someone else is projected to win and that other people
[53:06.580 --> 53:10.140]  don't go and cast their ballots or everyone just kind of gives up and
[53:10.140 --> 53:16.100]  believes that person is really the winner but no one ever asked who actually
[53:16.100 --> 53:22.220]  tallies the votes at the national level shortly after JFK's death in
[53:22.220 --> 53:29.180]  1963 the Associated Press officially but very quietly took over the tabulation
[53:29.180 --> 53:35.260]  nationally of who the supposed winners of the elections were election after
[53:35.260 --> 53:41.100]  election voter news services numbers didn't match up with the real exit
[53:41.100 --> 53:46.700]  polls and recounts they got caught in so many national computer glitches that
[53:46.700 --> 53:51.860]  they were forced to disband the organization after the 2002 election but
[53:51.860 --> 53:57.420]  one day later a new corporation was formed with the exact same six companies
[53:57.420 --> 54:04.540]  at the head and that of course was national election pool national election
[54:04.540 --> 54:09.380]  pool is made up again of the very same mainstream media that runs the fraudulent
[54:09.380 --> 54:14.980]  polls and then ensures that those fraudulent poll numbers are regurgitated
[54:14.980 --> 54:21.420]  on election night and they're so arrogant they're so brazen now that they
[54:21.420 --> 54:27.460]  actually met before multiple primaries like the California primary and decided
[54:27.460 --> 54:32.140]  that Bernie Sanders would not get the popular vote even though the popular
[54:32.140 --> 54:38.340]  vote did go to him in New Hampshire California and nine other states what
[54:38.340 --> 54:45.140]  you've seen here is a snapshot of the ocean of proof of election fraud many
[54:45.140 --> 54:49.140]  people have died trying to bring this information out the call your brothers
[54:49.140 --> 54:53.660]  went through living hell their daughter fights on valiantly today so does
[54:53.660 --> 54:59.740]  Beth Harris I want to challenge all of you to go out and do your own basic
[54:59.740 --> 55:05.620]  research on this and then ask yourself what on earth is Obama doing when he
[55:05.620 --> 55:10.260]  makes a joke out of this he's doing the same thing that the spokesperson of the
[55:10.260 --> 55:13.780]  State Department did last Thursday when they brought up how they're supposed to
[55:13.780 --> 55:17.860]  be transparent and open he made a big joke and so did the media and they
[55:17.860 --> 55:20.900]  laughed the American people welcome to the State Department I think we have
[55:20.900 --> 55:28.140]  some interns in the back welcome good to see you in this exercise and
[55:28.140 --> 55:36.380]  transparency and democracy that's just like Gibbs the former press secretary
[55:36.380 --> 55:41.460]  for years after the drone program was public he was told to go on TV and say
[55:41.460 --> 56:04.460]  it didn't exist the New York Times reports and vice president Biden in these sessions talking about the way forward has pressed specifically for strategy that elevates the use of unmanned aerial vehicles drones and deemphasizes US combat forces on the ground can you tell us if that's true major I think you can understand why I'm not going to get into internal discussions
[56:04.460 --> 56:34.380]  I'm not going to get into the drone program exist the government lying to us exist election fraud exist and we've seen them pull out the stops with fake polls Google delisting Trump we have seen Hillary's own email sending protesters to act like Bernie Sanders people to attack Trump folks so these two sides that should work together instead would be involved in a civil war we've seen dirty trick after dirty trick
[56:34.380 --> 57:03.900]  and the good news is the American people and the people the world aren't buying the fraud anymore it was just eight days ago that I put out an emergency message to Donald Trump concerning the evidence of election fraud and you know what Trump responded within 48 hours and it became a national issue in a national debate and Obama was forced to respond now if Trump and others point out that we have this national election pool running the show they may be forced to back off you see Trump isn't a puppet like a mint Romney or John McCain
[57:03.900 --> 57:27.900]  he's not going to sit there and let them steal this from the American people and now it's up to the American people to do our job and help Mr. Trump and help Bernie Sanders supporters as well ensure that free and open elections continue on this country they may have stolen it from Sanders at the nomination level but they're not going to steal this national election without an information warfare fight
[57:33.900 --> 57:54.900]  now that extremely important report is on info wars dot com right now and I don't want the credit from Breitbart or World Net Daily or Daily Call or any of these places I know you're better organizations that you might actually research this yourselves and the reports on the zero heads you name it I'm asking for your children my children
[57:54.900 --> 58:13.900]  for the future safety of this world that everybody go borrow into our research find out it's accurate and get it out to everybody you know the video is up on info wars dot com it's a special report Obama slips up secret group running elections reveal you need to get this video out to everybody you know there's
[58:13.900 --> 58:28.900]  another video I'm going to play dealing with social media and how far Trump really is ahead there as well the reason they're panicking in the New York Times in places and saying let's just not even tolerate opposition now I didn't get to that key point is because they
[58:28.900 --> 58:42.900]  know Trump's 15 points ahead and I hadn't even gotten yet to the New York Times not just calling you know admitting they censor but saying shut down opposition they're going full totalitarian thank you for listening to GCN
[58:42.900 --> 58:47.900]  in the face of that we have to get aggressive
[59:12.900 --> 59:27.900]  on the end of our chromosomes but when it runs out you start dying we chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one of the most effective substances in the world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve growth factor
[59:27.900 --> 59:43.900]  so this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount it's in powder form we have so many five star reviews I take this this is this is the product that I take info wars life dot com and the profit we make we fight the globals we fight the new world order secure your DNA force today
[59:43.900 --> 01:00:05.900]  at info wars life dot com or call toll free 888-253-3139 you're listening to the Alex Jones show in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwanted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:23.900]  in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas the first report to say that president Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new world order
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:49.900]  it was almost as if it were a planned implosion it's just pancake either you're with us or you're with the terrorists
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:59.900]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:22.900]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge but are we all just living and dying for what the central banks do and for me give me liberty or give me death
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:32.900]  this is my from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:47.900]  Hillary Clinton is desperate Donald Trump was 10 points ahead in the polls until Reuters and others began sampling 10 to 15% more Democrats in their polls to skew the numbers it's incredible but despite all that skewing in the last two weeks now in major
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:59.900]  Trump has put up with the very same groups with the same methodology Trump is neck and neck with her or even a point or two ahead but if you go look at the social media and Breitbart and Gateway Pundit have done this it's incredible
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:18.900]  we're talking 3, 4, 5, 6 times the support and places like Facebook, live stream, Reddit and so many other places in fact sometimes he's got 10 times more likes and 10 times more views that's what we saw with Bernie Sanders where he'd have 20,000 people Hillary'd have 500
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:31.900]  we did exit polls in California and other so-called battleground states and the Democratic primary and we talked to eight people before we found one or two Hillary supporters that's why Hillary was forced to steal it with the super delegates
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:47.900]  let's look at some of the numbers themselves Trump had 10 million plus likes to Clinton's 5 million on Facebook and that's with Facebook admittedly censoring Trump pages everywhere they can and even meeting with Hillary Clinton just like Google does
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:03:05.900]  Trump averages 30,000 live viewers per stream and Clinton averages 500 live stream viewers per stream on Reddit Trump averages 197,000 plus subscribers Hillary 24,000 Hillary for prison has 55,000 subscribers
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:16.900]  gee wonder who started that and this is only a snapshot of the numbers we're seeing with Trump you go to YouTube his average video has millions of views
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:29.900]  you go look at Hillary's official campaign site most of your videos have two or three thousand views her bigger ones a few hundred thousand this lady's a joke she's not like our own party but we're being told it's going to be a landslide for her
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:42.900]  because they're trying to get us ready for election fraud something so well documented in this country's past but Obama says it's preposterous he doesn't even know what that is
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:51.900]  well President Obama we do know what it is and this time we don't have somebody like Mitt Romney or John McCain who's going to stand down and not take action
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:59.900]  we don't have somebody that's going to throw in the towel there's fraud we've got Donald Trump and an awake population that's aware of your scams
[01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:08.900]  the social engineers have jumped the shark they are stealing this election in front of everyone by forcing them to engage in fraud we are exposing them forever
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:20.900]  so even if Donald Trump loses even if that happens due to fraud or scandals it doesn't matter because we've been in the arena we've politically exposed the system political correctness globalism
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:33.900]  the maxim has been introduced Americanism not globalism this is a good time to be alive ladies and gentlemen and we owe Donald Trump so much for being willing to put his family his life his treasure on the line
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:42.900]  he is the man on the arena and I'm honored to be on that arena with him as well if you haven't joined us in this historic fight it's time to pick a side right now
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:58.900]  and by the way more good news Donald Trump is giving a very powerful speech right now it's live on Fox News and other channels in Detroit on how he plans to rebuild our economy
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:08.900]  Hillary Clinton's homebrew e-mail server which was used to send classified U.S. government information may have led directly to the death of a scientist in Iran who provided intelligence to the U.S.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:17.900]  as reported by Steve Watson of info wars dot com last week the Iranian government executed the scientist after charging him with treason for providing quote vital information to the enemy
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:26.900]  the Iranians were apparently tipped off about the scientist ties to the CIA thanks to Hillary's unsecured server after the former secretary of state discussed his situation in plain text e-mail
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:31.900]  and in response to the controversy senator Tom Cotton said Hillary's recklessness could have easily caused the death of the scientist
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:39.900]  he said quote that goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:47.900]  and I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe and remember Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied about sending classified information over her home e-mail server
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:57.900]  and continued to suggest she never did such a thing even after the FBI investigation concluded that's exactly what she did and to find out more visit info wars dot com

[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:18.900]  we're listening to the alex jones show
[01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:35.900]  the globalist do not like the fact that they don't control the narrative donald trump is there exposing the planned deindustrialization of the united states the globalist sold out our interest and own and control and run the factories in china, india, mexico and 160 plus of the third world nations
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:53.900]  and it doesn't even benefit the mexicans or the chinese or others on average no environmental standards no nothing all these regulations all these controls here more expensive electricity we cannot compete it's a miracle we've got any industry left
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:09:06.900]  we've been deindustrialized about 86% from what we were in the 1960s this is serious of a nation can't build it can't do anything so let's go to trump in the middle of a speech
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:34.900]  they actually said it when i ran for political office it's not gonna happen he's never done it before it happened america is ready to prove the doubters wrong they want you to think small i am asking you to think big we are ready to dream great things for our country once again
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:51.900]  we are ready to show the world that america is back bigger and better and stronger than ever before thank you very much god bless you thank you thank you thank you very much
[01:09:51.900 --> 01:10:07.900]  all right i wanted you to see the end of it let's go back to the start now and obviously throughout the broadcast we're gonna be playing excerpts of it but let's go back that was from the communist news network we wanted to see their feed because a lot of times they'll just cut it they don't like what's being said as ABC news and others have been caught doing
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:23.900]  that's up on info wars.com Alexa now wants to have smart systems in your house that's amazon that run your home and spy on you and of course they're the ones that fix and game all of the internet numbers to try to bankrupt anybody right of satan so we're gonna be breaking that down as well
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:43.900]  and an incredible article that billy corgan sent me this morning he said have you seen this and i texted him back and i said yeah it's all over the place they're saying that they should take the gloves off be deceptive the media should lie he texted me back and he said alex you're missing the boat here they're openly saying in the article they should shut us down and not let us have free speech
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:55.900]  and he's correct jim ruttenberg i mean that's how crazy this is getting let me just give you organs actual quote i don't want to butcher it
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:11:12.900]  not to quibble as you've been reading this landslide for longer than i but i think you're missing a major point which is the cleaving point as signal by the new york times piece i sent you others like it is to permanently delegitimize not only opposition but alternate media and thought
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:23.900]  and ensure that any victory in that direction should be nulled or made void yes they obama says you're not allowed to have trump i have disqualified him
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:34.900]  the pope says that the communist chinese president says that the mexican president says that and then they openly tried to steal the nomination from him they stole it from sanders
[01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:49.900]  they've got this secretive national voting pool that ap runs that announced all these states for hillary she lost that's going to be announcing things and it's been caught in every major election the article of the twelve minute investigative report
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:57.900]  is on info wars dot com obama slips up exposes secret group running us elections
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:06.900]  yeah i'm gonna have that red link is it so incredibly important and we show in there
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:18.900]  every election where they engage in fraud and through the election the way the establishment wanted in the past though the democrats and republicans would share power that's why the republicans and democrats are combined forces against trump at the top right now
[01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:30.900]  because there do a lot duopoly their two-headed monster one body their system is being exposed they're not invincible so they're pulling out all the stops
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:39.900]  people say well they may steal it from him we still win by engaging it's not just lying here thanks to trump we've got up a candidate
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:51.900]  we've got the nominee who beat all the odds with the people to defeat them and to have such landslides they couldn't steal it
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:13:06.900]  and now they are twisting everything he says they are openly saying he's disqualified he quit every dirty trick his wife's a whore blah blah all these lies he's an illegal alien
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:21.900]  the hypocrisy of these people is unbelievable and they go back to all his liberal stances and say oh he's double crossing conservatives you wouldn't be scared of him if he was double crossing
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:38.900]  no the truth is he's a populace he's liberal in some issues but he's americana and wants us to have a fair shake he isn't out to get america and the new world order knows that he's about americanism not globalism
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:14:01.900]  i want to play some of this trump speech let's let's let's though detroit michigan the rust belt and let's hear donald trump talking about dreaming big and putting america first not using america's money and engine and industry to build this worldwide government for the globalists that they don't use to bring in peace as they sold it but as a combine to consolidate global control and have a corporate empire
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:08.900]  our industry was sold off to the world to establish all these systems
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:22.900]  we could turn our economy back on like that we could bring in skilled labor like that we could write our ticket like that we could stop having our industry be a prison like that
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:34.900]  we could stop all the race war garbage and all the cops out of control and the people killing cops like that with culture with bringing people together with honor snap your fingers
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:42.900]  snap your fingers snap your neck real easy snap the neck attorney like that you just kind of want to do it
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:52.900]  freedoms like selling snow cones in hell it's like selling people blankets in the Antarctic it ain't hard to sell compared to tyranny
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:15:04.900]  you want starving kids with their ribs sticking out little fat dictators waddling around like kim jong-un that can't even produce electricity for 99% of the country
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:12.900]  it's like a craved weird power trip demonic look in his eyes and you look at that state department spokesman and Gibbs eyes when they're lying to the public
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:23.900]  like we queue up the entire state department club I want to play that coming up in the next segment but right now let's let's go to Donald Trump here it is in Detroit today just finish this speech
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.900]  thank you everybody thank you very much
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:32.900]  thank you
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:38.900]  such a crowd beautiful thank you very much thank you
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:42.900]  thank you please
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:50.900]  thank you for the invitation to speak to you today it's wonderful to be in Detroit
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:55.900]  and here many times
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:04.900]  we now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:18.900]  it's a conversation about how to make America great again for everyone especially and I say especially for those who have the very least
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:24.900]  the city of Detroit is where our story begins
[01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:36.900]  Detroit was once the economic envy of the world the people of Detroit helped to power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:56.900]  this ruptures
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:17:01.900]  all because he pointed out that we've been conquered by globalists
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:08.900]  when we were governed by the America first policy Detroit was absolutely booming
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:20.900]  engineers builders laborers shippers and countless others went to work each day provided for their families and lived out totally
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:29.900]  lived out the American dream two cars but for many living in this city camping fishing that dream has long ago vanished
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:39.900]  vacation when we abandoned the policy college America first we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:50.900]  for the global skyscrapers went up in Beijing and many other cities around the world while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled right here in Detroit
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:18:03.900]  our roads and bridges fell into disrepair yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:13.900]  today Detroit has per capita income of under fifteen thousand dollars about half of the national average
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:21.900]  forty percent of the city's residents live in poverty over two and a half times the national average
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:27.900]  unemployment rate is more than twice the national average
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.900]  half of all Detroit residents do not work
[01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:40.900]  Detroit tops the list of the most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:46.900]  another communist disruptor New York Times is calling just shutting free speech down
[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:53.900]  Alexis already been caught racketeering shutting down any opposition online delisting try to bankrupt people total criminal ops folks
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:19:00.900]  they're moving they're moving if we don't stop them now it's over there get the Supreme Court and they're going to start arresting everybody
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.900]  they said they are
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:07.900]  Detroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:18.900]  these are silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:24.900]  all right we're going to hit pause and come back with more we're going to play some more of this again we ended with the end of a speech live
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:32.900]  we're going back through it right now and Alex Jones this is obviously the Monday World Wide Broadcast the eighth day of August 2016
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:41.900]  if you think cops have problems now or you have a problem with cops now wait till they've been globalized the attack on police is about bullying them to go under globalist control
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:51.900]  under the Strong Cities Initiative and then they're going to be political police just like you see them in Oregon and other areas where they allow the anti-Trump people to beat up women
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:59.900]  to bloody pulps when the police are asked to do something they laugh at you these are evil evil people

[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:13.900]  after James Wood says what's the Vegas line on Julian Assange actually staying alive until the election I think Assange is really asking for it
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:19.900]  not releasing the information he says will quote get Hillary indicted
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:35.900]  and the media is attacking Matt Drudge oh that was a photo of Hillary falling down the stairs a month ago well a new site just pointed out she's falling down going upstairs and she's actually completely insane and had blood clots in her brain it looks like she has Parkinson and has lesions on her tongue and you know the
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:48.900]  Secret Service has always attacking people and foaming at the mouth and I mean if Trump was doing this would be a big issue let's go back to Donald J. Trump in Detroit earlier
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:58.900]  in Detroit is the living breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:06.900]  not failed it's globalism instead of the world government
[01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:29.900]  policy that has failed the city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton she supports the high taxes and radical regulation that force jobs out of your community and the crime policies have made you far far less safe and the immigration
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:58.900]  policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA signed by her husband that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice freedom and opportunity
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:10.900]  the candidate of the past ours is the campaign of the future
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:27.900]  this is a city controlled by democratic politicians at every level and unless we change policies we will not change results 100%
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:44.900]  today I will outline my economic vision in the coming weeks we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:28:10.900]  this is what happens when you go from 35 people to close to 2000 people I guess
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:22.900]  in the coming weeks we will be offering more detail on all of these policies and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:28.900]  our opposition on the other hand has long ago run out of ideas
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:43.900]  all Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same more taxes more regulations more bureaucrats more restrictions on American energy and on American production more of that
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:58.900]  if you were a foreign power looking to weaken America you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:13.900]  nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:28.900]  our policy of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States
[01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:41.900]  this is the playing field towards other countries at our expense and that's why we are going to back this up a little bit we come back and play a few more minutes for our next guest joins us and a lot of other news we are going to be breaking
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:59.900]  and surprisingly today the Communist Party has come out and endorsed Hillary Clinton so you'll want to know that
[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:10.900]  video from Donald Trump's speech in Daytona Beach last week shows ABC news cutting the live feed as Trump begins to talk about Hillary Clinton's connections to ISIS as reported by Paul Joseph Watson of infoworse.com
[01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:22.900]  before the feed was cut Trump said quote take a look at Lando take a look at San Bernardino take a look at the World Trade Center and we let ISIS take this position it was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:30.900]  and after Trump made that statement ABC News cut the feed and went to background music ABC isn't the only network to cut the feed with someone's critical of Hillary
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:40.900]  last month for example CNN cut its own feed when a reporter pointed out that Hillary's support for anti crime legislation in the 90s led to the mass incarceration of African Americans
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:53.900]  Hillary supported jihadists in the Middle East particularly in Libya and Syria while serving as Secretary of State has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims the fact the mainstream media keeps downplaying while claiming Trump is quote Islamophobic
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:59.900]  and to find out more visit infoworse.com this is Kit Daniels reporting

[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:32.900]  we got sabotage going on against our economy and Donald Trump just talked about it earlier an hour ago or less in Detroit why does Hillary and others he did actually make a prediction and they just make the deals to ship our jobs in China
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:47.900]  like Macharia the former head of the UN's carbon tax program would have plants moved from England to India that he and his family actually owned once they got to India oh it's sabotage
[01:33:47.900 --> 01:34:10.900]  I know you planned it and it's going to stop great part about Trump is he's injecting all this truth out there we're going to go to someone that they really got mad at Trump because he wasn't endorsing Paul Ryan the open borders anti gun in many cases free trade globalist who wants secret TPP to be able to make these rules that
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:26.900]  the public can't even see till it's already rammed through and depending on how the polls are the point is is that we need to get this guy elected and there's been a lot of chicanery going on the whole establishment is trying to defend Mr. Ryan we're going to be talking to

Mr. Nealon is challenging the speaker the United States representatives.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:22.900]  That's a Paul Ryan in Wisconsin's first congressional district Republican primary election August 9 so that's coming up here boom tomorrow Mr. Nealon serves as senior vice president of operations for his company that leads the industry in water filtration we're just talking about that
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:38.900]  and disinfection technologies or civilization I would say since 2013 Mr. Nealon has served as an advisory board member of operation home front of Wisconsin nonprofit organization with strong record of bringing direct financial assistance to the families of active duty service members
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:56.900]  Paul Nealon NEHLEN.com everybody should get behind him just to put more heat we already brought down the Rhino you know who of course was installed by Newt Gainrich and that was the former speaker Boehner or Crab baby and then now we have Paul Ryan who I guess is a handsome guy
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:10.900]  Mr. Blue Eyes but you know at the end of the day a lot of people well I mean I know Paul Nealon's story is interesting I don't want to get it wrong I remember hearing about it the reason he started running against him was he was tired of being betrayed is that is that accurate Mr. Nealon.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:31.900]  That's absolutely accurate thanks for having me on Alex you know I believed Paul Ryan's shtick he absolutely is he's the head of the snake let's let's make no mistake about it he absolutely is the most open borders anti worker
[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:46.900]  her Wall Street member of Congress on either side of the aisle and he is the head of the snake and we're going to take him off we're going to cut the head off snake because he absolutely has no moral qualms at all about shipping our jobs over to China
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:38:12.900]  he he is completely beholden to Wall Street and we just don't pay well enough here in Wisconsin's district first district he gets paid a lot better by big foreign big corporations not foreign excuse me big corporations that do the bidding of maybe a thousand families in this country that that enrich themselves over the destruction of America
[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:25.900]  sure well they fence the money too but a lot of the money is far and look at Hillary's look at Hillary's foundation get I mean get back to yourself and why you decided to go after the sky because you know they they've been selling for a decade on conservative talk radio is this little angel of
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:47.900]  conservatism when you get into his actual votes he's the opposite of that exactly right I out myself and say hey I was a Paul Ryan supporter until he came out as the mercenary champion of fast track trade promotion authority for this trans civic partnership and when I read that I read what
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:39:05.900]  senator sessions God bless him went out and and reported on it Alex you know I had to go to the New Zealand government website I had to go to the New Zealand website because our own government had that information hidden from us and you know what I found out that
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:22.900]  everything that senator sessions reported on was absolutely true I go into the New Zealand website article 27 of TPP gives up US sovereignty it reduces the length of US patents I just got my fifth US patent three weeks ago tomorrow
[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:39.900]  it gives it gives H1Bs and H2Bs we won't even be talking about H1Bs and H2Bs because foreign companies will be able to bring all the workers they want to this United States won't be the United States anymore will be the United States of Asia
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:59.900]  Paul Ryan is the globalist soulless globalist head of the snake and that's why tomorrow we're gonna cut the head of that snake off we're absolutely gonna have Wisconsin's independence day tomorrow because we are sick to death of his lies and his deceit and his working on behalf of
[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:20.900]  corporations he could care less about us here in Wisconsin workers he could care less about Puerto Ricans and yet he pushed through the Puerto Rico hedge fund bailout he could care less about Wisconsin's pensioners which way we're sold those junk bonds invested in Puerto Rico
[01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:39.900]  but his hedge fund integers oh he loves them he loves them because they put money in his campaign coffers and he has got visions of running in 2020 that's why he wants to stab Mr Trump in the back at every opportunity he doesn't want to see him succeed
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:54.900]  I said this before Paul Ryan should be reporting in kind contributions Hillary Clinton's campaign because he's working on her behalf as opposed to working on behalf of Donald Trump
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:09.900]  well I like in your race and others when loser draw is patriotic doing I appreciate your time and energy to do this because I remember you talking about when you first were running how folks have been betrayed by member Eric canner now he was way ahead in the polls on election day he lost
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:25.900]  we've learned these polls especially in key races trying to prop folks up are absolutely stage and and and then meanwhile a little known economics professor beat seem 55 to 44 that's Dave brat that we've had on the broadcast we should get him back up
[01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:37.900]  I remember polls back at the time said he was going to be losing about 30 points now they've got ridiculous polls even worse out on you which shows me how desperate they are because if you can take down this this this lead fake rhino
[01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:57.900]  I bought the rest of these guys right yeah we're sending a message here you know I will never stop running against speaker Ryan I am going to take him down God is my witness I am going to be on him every moment of every day until I have his seat
[01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:17.900]  I'm not going away I'm going to take that seat tomorrow and if by some miracle he keeps it and I say miracle because I'm telling you Alex we are knocking thousands of doors a day we hit almost 10,000 about to say sir sir we we we couldn't find anyone in California that was for Hillary
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:32.900]  God bless them they were all there were Democrats for Sanders and then at the polls 8 out of 10 people were for Sanders so I don't know she'd have 500 people he'd have 20,000 she has a thousand Trump is 50,000 I mean something's going on here with these polls
[01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:58.900]  I had more people at my campaign rally with Ann Coulter on Saturday than Hillary Clinton is having at her events to give you some sense of that and that's not saying a lot because she has hardly anybody there unless they're her staffers but speaker Ryan has betrayed Wisconsin's first district has betrayed Wisconsin has betrayed this nation
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:03.900]  well you live up there what type of guy is he I mean we know he does the opposite of what he says
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:18.900]  I mean how why is it why does he I mean really there you are with a business with all these employees running all this stuff it's hard to do in America but you're doing I do the same thing because we're not going to you know give into this garbage but I mean he just why do they love to do this to our country
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:36.900]  it's the money it is the it is the pure raw chase for money and power there's there's there's no question the vast majority of Paul Ryan's campaign financing comes inside the DC Beltway when you stop and think about how he could be voting on Wisconsin's
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:53.900]  behalf when most of his money the DC Beltway when I saw his first FEC reports and saw that the vast majority 83% of his campaign financing came from outside of Wisconsin's first district the vast majority of which came from inside the DC Beltway
[01:43:53.900 --> 01:44:16.900]  it's just it's sickened me like you can't imagine because here's a guy that I put signs in the ground for here's a guy who I made phone calls on behalf of I was a diamond sponsor and fall fast here got my picture taken with my wife with the guy I gave my hard earned money and my hard earned time to support this guy
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:25.900]  and and what's he do he turns around and champions this trade deal going to give away I had I've got over 10,000 employees in my lifetime Alice.
[01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:45.900]  Fortune 500 in charge of Europe, the Middle East and Africa I had to over $2 billion worth of business report to me. Do you know where I started out? I started out on the factory floor. I was on the gay degree at night 12 year program. That's where I started out.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:58.900]  I eventually ran that factory. I've run factories all over the United States. I shut down businesses in Mexico and brought those jobs United States just last August. I shut down the factory portion of a business we bought in Canada.
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:17.900]  Those jobs back to the East Coast to move jobs from the East Coast to Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. And I did it with with China. I brought product lines back China put them in Indiana and in Florida. Every case, every case I've done it more profitably.
[01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:33.900]  Globalism is set up to and again, we're not to get China or anybody. It's set up to give the people nothing and consolidate control at Ross Perot talked about a giant sucking sound. We should use the West to build up the third world, not transfer the west of the third world, but only selectively and then implode the
[01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:47.900]  whole planet. Why do you think the globalist Paul Nealon Paul Nealon.com in the big primary tomorrow against Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Why do you think they're doing this system when as you pointed out long term globalism is not profitable.
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:46:03.900]  I know why it's about consolidation of control working with totalitarian countries and third world nations. You can consolidate control you can undercut and you can transfer the power to yourself and I think that's really nasty. I mean if I was a rich billionaire or whatever I would want to see lots of
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:19.900]  businesses and lots of industry like Henry Ford called for and employees that could buy the cars you're making and prosperity but simply here. It's the time of austerity we need to be poor now from Obama speaking from red carpets in front of giant, you know Air Force One.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:35.900]  These guys have already these guys have already dissolved borders mentally they are they already made the switch. The rest of us are considered surfs to them and they got a plan and we're in the way of it.
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:49.900]  That's exactly right. And you know that as I've been campaigning around this district and I've been getting some more notoriety. These guys are doing everything they can the Wisconsin GOP, the party machine,
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:47:05.900]  ranks previous and the entire the entire machine is so clamped down on the levers of power and and and wanting to stay on those levers of power to keep me from from secure in America's jobs.
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:21.900]  They want open borders so bad Paul Ryan couldn't help but say on CNN on his. I was calling it the CNN never Trump infomercial Paul Ryan was on there talking about how we need to keep us we need to change immigration lots we can keep a steady stream
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:35.900]  of low cost labor coming into this country. I mean, to have somebody say we need to keep down wages in this country. The entire time Paul Ryan has been in Congress the last 18 years wages have been down.
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:51.900]  You go to the grocery store things cost more. We've actually we're actually losing ground in the middle class. Forget about forget about inner city or or anywhere. People just getting on to the just getting on the ladder.
[01:47:51.900 --> 01:48:09.900]  African Americans, we go immigrants, recent legal immigrants and my district to me. We, we worked hard to come here. We love this country. We say the Pledge of Allegiance we we salute the flag we free.
[01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:23.900]  And we will be damned if we want speaker Ryan to let everybody in here in front of us. We have a legal immigration. Absolutely. And again, I can't go to China or Mexico and show up and have my baby for free.
[01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:31.900]  And then the baby's a citizen and I get they sell it as this loving thing. They're using the immigrants to drive down the wages. They're using them as a new political group.
[01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:46.900]  They can control. And again, none of these countries will let us do this there. This is this is they've used America's openness, the globalist have. And look, I think you and many others, like Brad are really the bellwether.
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:59.900]  And whether you win tomorrow or not, it doesn't matter because you're going to win long term. As you said, you're never going to give up. You started out on the factory floor 12 years, you know, in college getting through that, you know, then managing in a billions of dollars a year worldwide and running things.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:11.900]  You're a hardworking smart guy. And that's the secret in this world. People are actually looking for folks who are smart want to take action. Don't just be jellyfish. And it is that spirit that awakening to the tyranny that you can't put the genie back in the bottle.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:19.900]  In my view, I don't see how the globalists are going to get their program through when when look at the Brexit. Look, I think the tide's turning.
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:35.900]  Absolutely. I've got friends over in London. I live when I when I was running those those other regions. I had a flat in London that I only saw on the weekends. A man I would love landed in Heathrow or or Gatwick and talking to the cabbies.
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:50.900]  Mandid they I used to love running them up and thank God you guys stayed on the pound and thank God Poland stayed on the Zloty and thank God Denmark stayed on the Kroner because otherwise they've got you by the shorthairs.
[01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:56.900]  They absolutely have you the EU. Let me throw a couple numbers at you.
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:06.900]  There are 5.5 billion people with the B that make less per day than the average Mexican worker.
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:14.900]  So what are we going to do? We're going to move them all here. We are going to give them all an opportunity here. Put them all on welfare and social assistance.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:29.900]  Paul Ryan took money away from our veterans to give to go a welfare. He did that when when when you think about what Paul Ryan is capable of doing and what he's a monster. But just like Ted Bundy, he's a handsome guy.
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:44.900]  So you don't understand you're getting in a yellow Volkswagen. Paul Nealon Paul Nealon.com. I hope you win tomorrow. Regardless, you've won by taking action, engaging the public, injecting real issues folks to contribute Paul Nealon.com.
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:53.900]  We got family in Wisconsin. You're up there. Get out and vote for this guy in the Republican primary. Look forward to speaking to you in the future, my friend and hopefully when you're a congressman.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:59.900]  Thank you, Paul. All right, we'll be back. Ladies and gentlemen, more news and more guests straight ahead on Alex Jones.

[01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:39.900]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water. If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:24.900]  America's power was leveraged to set up a worldwide corporate empire. If you go back to the 1780s and 90s, there were major British newspaper articles saying the American system of lower taxes and less regulation and not only letting lords have licenses to have factories and businesses
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:35.900]  is shutting down our system worldwide, we won't be able to compete with it, and they estimated within 50 years the United States would begin to outstrip the British Empire, which it began to do.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:50.900]  Then the Germans got free market, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and there were articles all over the British press before World War I saying, oh my gosh, we've got the German problem, it's worse than the American problem.
[01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:58.900]  So they went over and shot the Archduke, started a civil war, funded street riots, and the Germans bellied up to the bar and had a big war.
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:14.900]  So I'm not blaming the British themselves, but the British Empire model of control is what's the big New Brzezinski and Carol Quigley and Cecil Rhodes and all the rest of these people say were under.
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:26.900]  Henry Kissinger writes books, you can go read them, people keep saying, man Alex you about this stuff 20 years ago and it's all come true, are you a secret agent?
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:35.900]  I read their books, we're living in their world, and let me tell you where it goes next isn't pretty.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:49.900]  We have that State Department clip, because chairs half way broken here, because that's really important where the spokesman, because I'm going to play the full clip last week.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:56:01.900]  He's just making jokes because there's a group of interns here, and he goes, we're going to teach the interns about how to be transparent and how to be good and democracy, and they all laugh and cackle because they're really inducting them into corruption,
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:08.900]  like Gruber when he gets up on C-Span and says, I'm the best liar, that's why the president hired me to screw folks on Obamacare.
[01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:12.900]  So it's just really a cynical, sick culture. Here's that clip.
[01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:23.900]  Welcome to the State Department, I think we have some interns in the back, welcome. Good to see you in this exercise in transparency and democracy.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:40.900]  Is that what it is? I thought it was an exercise in spin and obfuscation.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:55.900]  Again, they just institutionalize it like it's funny. It's really, really painful.
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:57:01.900]  It's really, really painful to see that we've gotten this level in this culture and this society.
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:10.900]  But the good news is the culture is changing. We still have a little bit of a free economic system left. That's why they want to extinguish it because that can leverage out their whole program.
[01:57:10.900 --> 01:57:21.900]  And in Americana and owning firearms and rock climbing and getting into extreme sports, all of this is pro-human activity, getting us out of the nanny state.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:31.900]  The human spirit is struggling against it and it's going to be those type of activities that end up overall transcending what the New World Order is trying to do.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:38.900]  And they'll just be a bunch of mentally ill people gibbering in a corner, laughing and talking about the good old days when they ran things.
[01:57:38.900 --> 01:57:45.900]  And when things flip back to honor, you do one thing dishonorable, one thing weasel-y, you're going to have to pay for it.
[01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:52.900]  So just a bunch of dishonorable people going, ah, we have the high ground throwing crap at us all day trying to demoralize us.
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:58:01.900]  Here's an article, NRA reports, you had another record-setting month for firearm purchases over 16 million FBI background checks in the first seven months of 2016.
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:13.900]  That's 16 million more people buying guns and it just keeps happening month after month after month after month after month after month after month after month after month.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:15.900]  Rugged individualism.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:20.900]  And despite the imploding economy, it's going to help hopefully keep the crime rate down.
[01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:24.900]  Speaking of funding on the economy, we're going to end the free shipping today.
[01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:32.900]  We'll be over on all items at infoorstore.com and BrainForce, the new tropics, about to end 40% off on that and a lot more.
[01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:39.900]  And we have also DNA Force, but we've added 40% off on Anthroplex. It's amazing, you really should try it.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:43.900]  We'll be back in infoorstore.com, infoorslife.com.
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:59:12.900]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.900]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:24.900]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives

[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:54.900]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:54.900 --> 02:00:04.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:37.900]  Thank you everybody.
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:48.900]  This is what happens when you go from 35 people to close to 2,000 people, I guess.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:01:00.900]  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we've already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.
[02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:06.900]  Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.
[02:01:06.900 --> 02:01:19.900]  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same, more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy, and on American production.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.900]  More of that.
[02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:31.900]  If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:36.900]  God bless that man. Total veritas. Donald J. Trump just hours ago, Detroit.
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:38.900]  Rotting skeleton.
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:48.900]  If you would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs right out of existence.
[02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:50.900]  And electricity that costs three times as much.
[02:01:50.900 --> 02:02:03.900]  The common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:10.900]  Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:22.900]  And that's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:49.900]  My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans and returning to a government that puts the American people first.
[02:02:49.900 --> 02:03:02.900]  Thank you. Thank you.
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:06.900]  Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.
[02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:09.900]  First, let's talk tax reform.
[02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:14.900]  Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:26.900]  Hillary Clinton, who has spent her career voting for tax increases, plans another massive job killing $1.3 trillion tax increase.
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:30.900]  Big increase, one of the biggest ever.
[02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:35.900]  Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost 50%.
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:42.900]  Recently at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short circulated, you know this, you've heard this one.
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:04:01.900]  Hillary Clinton short circulated again, to use a now famous term, when she accidentally told the truth and said that she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:08.900]  I am proposing an across the board income tax reduction, especially for middle income Americans.
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:13.900]  This will lead to millions of new and really good paying jobs.
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:23.900]  The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability.
[02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:27.900]  Hillary spends this that he wants to cut the corporate tax in half.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:38.900]  We have the highest corporate tax in the world, and the big corporations lobby for that knowing other corporations won't be sophisticated enough, small and medium.
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.900]  And then you move offshore.
[02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:48.900]  It's designed to facilitate that, and the big mega corporations control China and others, and then they bring you into the nation themselves and get a cut.
[02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:51.900]  The globalists want to work with the authoritarians.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:59.900]  They've shut America off and sold our industry off as a way to take over the planet and leverage it back to further shut us down.
[02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:08.900]  Hillary Clinton's homebrew email server, which was used to send classified U.S. government information, may have led directly to the death of a scientist in Iran who provided intelligence through the U.S.
[02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:11.900]  I was reported by Steve Watson of info wars dot com.
[02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:17.900]  Last week, the Iranian government executed the scientist after charging him with treason for providing quote vital information to the enemy.
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:22.900]  The Iranians were apparently tipped off about the scientist's ties to the CIA thanks to Hillary's unsecured server.
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:31.900]  After the former Secretary of State discussed his situation in plain text email and in response to the controversy, Senator Tom Cotton said Hillary's recklessness could have easily caused the death of the scientist.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:39.900]  He said quote, that goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server.
[02:05:39.900 --> 02:05:42.900]  And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe.
[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:54.900]  And remember, Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied about sending classified information over her home email server and continued to suggest she never did such a thing even after the FBI investigation concluded that's exactly what she did.

[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:23.900]  I got something that tells me what it's all about.
[02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:29.900]  I got stone and I'm super bad.
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:37.900]  I got stone and I'm super bad.
[02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:45.900]  Now I got a move that tells me what to do sometimes it's deep.
[02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:49.900]  It was the 1968 election.
[02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:52.900]  The last time we saw some money like Donald Trump.
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:09:00.900]  Reagan's close but a lot slicker but they knew he was an anti-federal reserve guy.
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.900]  They knew he was anti-New World Order.
[02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:07.900]  He called George Herbert Walker Bush a Rockefeller Republican who wanted a world government.
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:13.900]  He said he's part of that trilateral commission that wants to hand over our power to a worldwide government.
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:18.900]  We actually have the clips of Ronald Reagan's speeches in 1979 and 80 saying and I played him.
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:21.900]  We ought to find those because I know they hit the cutting room floor.
[02:09:21.900 --> 02:09:29.900]  They're in the film but we've got the actual tapes that we sent off to the news services and got one of them from CBS from 1979.
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:33.900]  Hardly have I seen this stuff and it's Ronald Reagan there on the podium.
[02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:39.900]  How about the New World Order and World Government and how it's got to be stopped and how they're going to set up multinational trade deals.
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:50.900]  He was reading John Burt's Society Literature at the time and boy they shot him within a year of being in office to shut him up and let him know the real bosses were.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:54.900]  But if you go back to Barry Goldwater you should read his book with no apologies.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:57.900]  Senator Barry Goldwater.
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.900]  I mean you'd think the establishment would want a guy like that.
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:05.900]  A very prominent family, patriot, owned shopping malls across the country.
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:11.900]  One of the first families to build shopping malls and he was led into the Trilateral Commission info.
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:13.900]  It was like I'm not going to sell America out and do all this.
[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:21.900]  And boy they came out and they said Barry Goldwater once a nuclear war with the Russians even though he was for daytime.
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:25.900]  Just like, heard of that before, just like Donald Trump.
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:38.900]  Donald Trump once a detente, detente, we got to queue up that minute and a half clip of the Princeton professor on CNN who's like a liberal and not even a Trump supporter.
[02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:40.900]  He's like this is all complete lies.
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:44.900]  Trump wants detente and you guys are acting like neo-McArthurites.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.900]  So now I am a Trump supporter.
[02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:54.900]  But they're running these ads now and saying Trump asked folks if we could use nuclear weapons and it turned out he never said it.
[02:10:54.900 --> 02:10:56.900]  It's Hillary running around starting all the wars.
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:02.900]  It's the globalist moving troops up against the border with Russia and moving nuclear missiles in.
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:04.900]  And the Russians have said that.
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:06.900]  They said they welcomed detente.
[02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:08.900]  They don't want to spend their money on military equipment.
[02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:12.900]  They don't want to have a new cold war that's designed to bankrupt all these other countries.
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:15.900]  The Russians aren't stupid.
[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:18.900]  They want to build civilization infrastructure.
[02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:22.900]  They want to sell aircraft and cars and computers.
[02:11:22.900 --> 02:11:30.900]  They've been shot out of the game for 80-something years and they want in the game and they can compete in the game.
[02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:32.900]  And Trump understands that.
[02:11:32.900 --> 02:11:33.900]  Trump is a builder.
[02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:35.900]  We're going to go to our guest here in a moment.
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:41.900]  But I wanted to play for the 1968 famous ad that they say made Barry Goldwater lose the election.
[02:11:41.900 --> 02:11:43.900]  He was ahead to LBJ.
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:50.900]  But notice LBJ's illnesses basically caused him to have to just get out later anyways.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:56.900]  So that's the amazing thing is we have Hillary Clinton staggering around,
[02:11:56.900 --> 02:12:03.900]  toddling around, falling down, having brain surgery, looking completely insane,
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:07.900]  obviously having seizures.
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:12.900]  I mean my uncle was in a motorcycle accident and his brain had been put back in his head.
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:14.900]  He had to learn how to talk and everything again.
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:17.900]  He was 17.
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:18.900]  My dad's brother.
[02:12:18.900 --> 02:12:21.900]  And I've been with him many times.
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:25.900]  I lived there quite a few summers and was sitting down there for a year.
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:26.900]  I was in hospital five years.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:27.900]  I was in trouble one year.
[02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:30.900]  When I was 16, I was sitting down there and he worked on the ranch.
[02:12:30.900 --> 02:12:32.900]  I worked for a large animal vet.
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:36.900]  But I would sometimes ride along with him in the morning checking fences and sometimes he'd go,
[02:12:36.900 --> 02:12:45.900]  he'd go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.900]  That's exactly what he would do.
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:51.900]  Now sometimes, I only saw this once, he would have the full-on thing where he got to stick a spoon in his mouth,
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:54.900]  a wooden spoon where he'd bite his tongue off.
[02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:59.900]  And boy, he couldn't have a bed for days after he'd have one of those full-on grand mall seizures.
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:04.900]  But she's having seizures in public.
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:08.900]  And then she's been trained to act like it's fun and no big deal.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:10.900]  And everybody's like asking, are you okay?
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:14.900]  She's got lesions on her tongue and she's clearly got signs of Parkinson's.
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:16.900]  And Bill Clinton has signs of Parkinson's.
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:18.900]  I don't know what drugs they've been on or what they're doing.
[02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:23.900]  The point is, is they're trying to say Donald Trump's unfit or he wants nuclear wars
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:26.900]  when everything they accuse him of is what they're doing.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:30.900]  Here is the 1960s TVN.
[02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:59.900]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:11.900]  They are the stakes to make a world in which all of God's children can live
[02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:13.900]  or to go into the dark.
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:19.900]  We must either love each other or we must die.
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:22.900]  Vote for President Johnson on November 3rd.
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:26.900]  The stakes are too high for you to stay home.
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:30.900]  We should make an ad showing all the murder and killing and Hillary funding ISIS
[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:33.900]  and all the rest of it and say the stakes are too high for President Trump.
[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:36.900]  President Johnson started the Vietnam War.
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:41.900]  President Johnson had all these plans to nuke the Soviet Union and Goldwater didn't.
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:44.900]  Just like Trump doesn't, but they inverted.
[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:45.900]  Here's Hayden.
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:47.900]  Then we're going to our guest, Michael Snyder, the Economic Collapse blog,
[02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:49.900]  prolific writer, researcher.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:52.900]  And he will be breaking all this down with the balance of the hour with us.
[02:14:52.900 --> 02:14:57.900]  But I wanted to show you Hayden, this is the weird, effeminate little creep boy
[02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:02.900]  that runs around these military uniforms, the NSA spying on us, spying on our wee-wees.
[02:15:02.900 --> 02:15:06.900]  And that's come out that they actually, the NSA, spy on their husbands and wives.
[02:15:06.900 --> 02:15:11.900]  And also headed up the CIA saying that Trump wants to nuke everyone.
[02:15:11.900 --> 02:15:12.900]  Here it is.
[02:15:12.900 --> 02:15:17.900]  What concerns you most about Donald Trump?
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:18.900]  He's not gay.
[02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:20.900]  How erratic he is.
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:24.900]  Joe, I can argue about this position or that position.
[02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:26.900]  I do that with the current president.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:28.900]  But he's inconsistent.
[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:38.900]  And when you're the head of a global superpower, inconsistency, unpredictability, those are dangerous things.
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:42.900]  They frighten your friends and they tempt your enemies.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.900]  And so I would be very, very concerned.
[02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:51.900]  Gerald Hayden, Harold Ford, very, very quickly, who amongst your peers that you respect greatly,
[02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:56.900]  whether they think like you or not think like you, did you know that's advising Mr. Trump?
[02:15:56.900 --> 02:15:58.900]  No one.
[02:15:58.900 --> 02:16:01.900]  That's a good answer.
[02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:03.900]  That's enough.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:06.900]  I was found dead in term in my office.
[02:16:06.900 --> 02:16:08.900]  Then I sold out the system.
[02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:10.900]  The girl's dead strangled.
[02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:12.900]  She was looking.
[02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:16.900]  I got Brzezinski's daughter right here, the man architect of the New World Order's daughter.
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:17.900]  Oh, baby.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:18.900]  Oh, yeah.
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.900]  By the way, I got my number flip.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:21.900]  LBJ bowed out in 68.
[02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:25.900]  Of course, the Goldwater election was, or unelection was in 64.
[02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:27.900]  All right.
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:32.900]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, let's go to our guest, Michael Schneider.
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:34.900]  There's so much to cover with you, my friend.
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:37.900]  What are some of the big topics you want to get into?
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:42.900]  Well, we can certainly talk about the economy, how the Wall Street Journal just come out and said,
[02:16:42.900 --> 02:16:47.900]  this is the weakest economic recovery since 1949, basically World War II.
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:50.900]  And so we can get into all the latest economic numbers.
[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:59.900]  We can also talk about more about Trump and about how the establishment is pulling out all the stops to try to derail him, stop him.
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:02.900]  In fact, just before I came on the show today, I went over to CNN.
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:08.900]  And on CNN today, they have a headline, one of their top headlines that says, Trump makes me cringe.
[02:17:08.900 --> 02:17:12.900]  In fact, if you go to just about any mainstream news website on any particular day,
[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:16.900]  you're going to find a negative story about Donald Trump right at the top,
[02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:21.900]  usually very, very closely associated with a positive story about Hillary Clinton.
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:24.900]  It's a full on propaganda onslaught.
[02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:30.900]  They're doing everything they can try to do to stop Trump's momentum to keep him out of the White House.
[02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:32.900]  And so the media is one way they're doing it.
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:34.900]  We can talk about some of the other ways.
[02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:39.900]  Yeah, let's get into that right after the break, the economy, the Trump situation, more.
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.900]  But why so much hysteria?
[02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:45.900]  I mean, this guy must be really good because from people I know that have known him for 40 years,
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:48.900]  they say he's been a closeted anti-New World Order patriot.
[02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:53.900]  And we see a lot of evidence that previously fighting NAFTA and GATT, and that's why they're so scared.
[02:17:53.900 --> 02:17:56.900]  Yeah, basically, he's not a globalist.
[02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:57.900]  He's not a part of the club.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:17:59.900]  He's not a part of the elite.
[02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:01.900]  So the elite are used to being in control.
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:03.900]  They're used to running the program.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:05.900]  They're used to having candidates.
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:10.900]  Hayden's used to wearing his NSA uniform on top of the pink two-two on bottom.
[02:18:10.900 --> 02:18:17.900]  Yeah, so the elite, they don't know what to do because they had hoped to stop him before Trump ever got the nomination.
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:24.900]  But by some miracle, because of this uprising of the American people, Trump won the nomination against all odds.
[02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:33.900]  But now the elite are absolutely determined to throw their weight behind Hillary Clinton, give Hillary Clinton more money than any candidate has ever been given before.
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:35.900]  They're going to do all that they can.
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:46.900]  But if they have to go beyond that to more extreme means, I believe that they're not going to hesitate in the least to do whatever it takes to keep Donald Trump out of the White House.
[02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:59.900]  I've never seen the Republican-Democratic establishment working this closely, this openly, all the powerful multinationals dumping money in, and weird leftist giggling and smirking, saying, we debosses, we debosses.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:01.900]  I mean, talk about pathetic.
[02:19:01.900 --> 02:19:02.900]  They claim their anti-establishment.
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:06.900]  Anyone that's anti-establishment has to be for Trump.
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:09.900]  Yeah, just look at the Republican establishment, what they're doing.
[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:23.900]  Sally Fletcher, who is Jeb Bush's top aide, she just came out to CNN in a key interview and she said, hey, I'm not only not voting for Donald Trump, but I'm leaving the Republican Party altogether because of Trump.
[02:19:23.900 --> 02:19:27.900]  And, you know, and Sally Fletcher, she's been working with the Bushes since 1988.
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:29.900]  I've always been operative.
[02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:31.900]  It's vacation with the Clintons.
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:34.900]  It's all a big narcotics trafficking mess.
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:41.900]  It is, and so not only Sally Fletcher, but you look at Hank Paulson, Henry Paulson, and people remember him from the 2008 financial crisis.
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.900]  He was Treasury Secretary.
[02:19:43.900 --> 02:19:44.900]  Well, he came out.
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:52.900]  Not only did he announce that he's not voting for Trump, but he announced it with a big article in The Washington Post saying, hey, I'm not voting for Trump.
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:55.900]  Many of my other establishment Republican friends are not voting for him.
[02:19:55.900 --> 02:19:56.900]  Absolutely.
[02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:58.900]  They're uncloking themselves as the Democrats they always were.
[02:19:58.900 --> 02:19:59.900]  Stay there, Michael Schneider.

[02:23:52.900 --> 02:24:08.900]  I'll be honest with you, I'm sitting here during the break thinking about what I want to come back and talk about and there's just too much to talk about.
[02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:15.900]  And it's all so crazy, I'm like, what are the words you describe how serious this is?
[02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:16.900]  You shouldn't even be on air.
[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:18.900]  You're not freaking out enough to get people's attention.
[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:23.900]  This is an emergency because if we just calmly talk about this, it'll just normalize it all.
[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:28.900]  I mean, for two years I've watched Alexa run by Amazon.
[02:24:28.900 --> 02:24:36.900]  Every libertarian nationalist, patriot, mainline Christian group, thousands and thousands of websites just delisted.
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.900]  They just say you have no traffic.
[02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:47.900]  All the same day, in the middle of October 2014, now they're going to run the smart houses in your house.
[02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:50.900]  Do you understand, folks, it's economic war.
[02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:59.900]  If they can shut you down and say you have no traffic and then you can't sell advertising and the big third party advertising sites won't do deals with you,
[02:24:59.900 --> 02:25:07.900]  you have been economically depressed just like the Nazis would block different areas where they didn't want people to get any business.
[02:25:07.900 --> 02:25:10.900]  This is such an assault and I didn't mean to go back into this.
[02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:25.900]  It's just going back to Michael Steiner getting into the economy and the gaming of things and the rigging and the ABC News cutting live feeds of Trump and saying technical difficulties whenever he talks about Hillary as the founder of ISIS.
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:27.900]  I mean, they admit they're doing it.
[02:25:27.900 --> 02:25:31.900]  They have all these articles admitting they're skewing the news now like it's a good thing.
[02:25:31.900 --> 02:25:34.900]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen the State Department spokesman, the head spokesman going,
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:41.900]  hey, we got college kids here to learn about freedom and being truthful.
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:44.900]  I mean, it's like it's reached maniac level.
[02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:46.900]  What is going on here?
[02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:56.900]  Well, you know, we live in a time when spin is everything and they want to make, you know, and now the whole goal is to make the Obama administration look good so that, you know, support will go to Hillary.
[02:25:56.900 --> 02:26:04.900]  Like just look at this job number that came out and on Friday, they said, oh, 255,000 jobs added the economy last month.
[02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:11.900]  But what they didn't tell you is there was a massive seasonal adjustment added, which made it look far better than it actually was.
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:20.900]  So if you look at the unadjusted numbers, for example, private payrolls, you know, according to the report, 217,000 jobs were added to private payrolls.
[02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:25.900]  But the unadjusted number was actually just 85,000 jobs added to private payrolls.
[02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:29.900]  And by the way, that's classic summer picking that's going on.
[02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:30.900]  Yeah.
[02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:37.900]  And but we need about 150,000 jobs or so each month just to keep up with population growth.
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:41.900]  So really last month, we didn't even keep up with population growth.
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:46.900]  And as you said, the Wall Street Journal says the worst recovery in modern history, that's with fake numbers.
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:49.900]  If they said the economy is at 1.8 growing, what is that?
[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:50.900]  Like 2, 3% negative?
[02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:51.900]  That's a full blown depression.
[02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:56.900]  Yeah, according to John Williams of status stats.com has been tracking this for years.
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:27:01.900]  U.S. economy has been actually in negative GDP growth all the way back to 2005.
[02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:07.900]  But even looking at their manipulated numbers, you know, for the, you know, the quarter that just ended.
[02:27:07.900 --> 02:27:09.900]  By the way, three quarters of negative is a depression.
[02:27:09.900 --> 02:27:10.900]  Yeah.
[02:27:10.900 --> 02:27:12.900]  And we're talking 10 years of it.
[02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:19.900]  But even looking at their manipulated numbers for the last quarter is 1.2% economic growth.
[02:27:19.900 --> 02:27:23.900]  The previous quarter was revised down to 0.8%.
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:31.900]  And then if you look at Obama's term as presidency as a whole, Barack Obama is on track even with the manipulated numbers.
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:40.900]  He's on track to be the only president in all of U.S. history to never have a single year of 3% economic growth.
[02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:41.900]  And he's had two terms to do it.
[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:42.900]  Let me raise this key.
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:45.900]  Michael Snyder, because you're an expert on this, you follow it so closely.
[02:27:45.900 --> 02:27:49.900]  He's great boil down analysis articles that I love four or five pages long.
[02:27:49.900 --> 02:27:54.900]  Every sentence is a documented link at the economic collapse blog.com.
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:56.900]  Here's the big issue.
[02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:59.900]  And they've got charts on this as you know, zero has just done it.
[02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:00.900]  We've done it.
[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:06.900]  You've done it where every incumbent or every party that's about to try to stay in power.
[02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:11.900]  If there is a stock market crash or an economic downturn, the party out of power gets in.
[02:28:11.900 --> 02:28:16.900]  We know they crashed it in 2007, 2008 for Obama, Wall Street engineered that it's admitted now.
[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:18.900]  They're trying to prop it up.
[02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.900]  The question is, can they prop it up until Hillary gets in?
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:24.900]  Well, I think that's what they want to do.
[02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:27.900]  I think they want to prop it up, at least through the election.
[02:28:27.900 --> 02:28:28.900]  Why?
[02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:35.900]  Well, if you go all the way back to 1928, and if you look at the last three months, and this is the period we're entering now,
[02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:41.900]  the last three months before the election, if during those three months, the three months leading up to the election,
[02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:46.900]  if the stock market goes up, the incumbent party wins.
[02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:49.900]  But if the stock market goes down, the incumbent party loses.
[02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:56.900]  The only times that have not been the case, it's happened three times, 1956, 1968, and 1980.
[02:28:56.900 --> 02:29:01.900]  Now, of course, this election is kind of breaking all the rules, and who knows if it'll hold up.
[02:29:01.900 --> 02:29:06.900]  Those who want Donald Trump to win, which would be most of your audience,
[02:29:06.900 --> 02:29:11.900]  those who want Trump to win should be hoping, actually, for the stock market to go down during these three months,
[02:29:11.900 --> 02:29:14.900]  because that's going to throw perhaps more support into the stock market.
[02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:22.900]  I don't engage in nerdy pool, but I tell you, anything to stop Hillary, anything to stop her getting four or five more Supreme Court justices,
[02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:27.900]  I mean, I think it's already so staged they can have the plunge protection team,
[02:29:27.900 --> 02:29:36.900]  the president's open group on markets, prop it up. But I tell you, it's a legal and lawful way to pull your money out to send a message against the establishment.
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:40.900]  Boy, I hate to call for a stock market crash, even if it's rigged.
[02:29:40.900 --> 02:29:58.900]  I just, well, let's talk about is it possible, or will they just prop it up? Michael Steiner, stay with us.
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:17.900]  Take a look at Orlando, take a look at San Bernardino, take a look at the World Trade Center, and we let ISIS take this position.
[02:30:17.900 --> 02:30:21.900]  It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them as the founder of ISIS.
[02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:26.900]  And right after Trump made that statement, ABC News cut the feed and went to background music.
[02:30:26.900 --> 02:30:29.900]  ABC isn't the only network to cut the feed with someone's critical of Hillary.
[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:36.900]  Last month, for example, CNN cut its own feed when a reporter pointed out that Hillary's support for anti-crime legislation in the 90s
[02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:41.900]  led to the mass incarceration of African Americans. And Hillary supported Jihadists in the Middle East,
[02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:48.900]  particularly in Libya and Syria while serving as Secretary of State, has directly led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims.
[02:30:48.900 --> 02:30:52.900]  The fact the mainstream media keeps downplaying while claiming Trump is, quote, Islamophobic.
[02:30:52.900 --> 02:31:07.900]  And to find out more, visit infowars.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting.

[02:31:58.900 --> 02:32:03.900]  Not a group you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[02:32:03.900 --> 02:32:08.900]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:13.900]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[02:32:13.900 --> 02:32:21.900]  but right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:28.900]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:29.900]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:32.900]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:36.900]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:39.900]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:43.900]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:46.900]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[02:32:55.900 --> 02:33:22.900]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:33:22.900 --> 02:33:30.900]  Reflecting on my past life.
[02:33:30.900 --> 02:33:41.900]  It's so frustrating to know we're right. It's so frustrating to know that we've already made such big inroads against the enemy.
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:48.900]  But the weakness of our people is what makes me think deep down, at least for this round,
[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:53.900]  that humanity is going to go through something that's going to make World War II
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:34:04.900]  and the 50-plus million dead look like a walk in the park.
[02:34:04.900 --> 02:34:11.900]  Good in the world is running low, running low.
[02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:15.900]  That is good in high places is running low.
[02:34:15.900 --> 02:34:20.900]  That's the end of the world that Donald Trump is an anti-globalist
[02:34:20.900 --> 02:34:24.900]  and doesn't want to sign one-sided deals to screw us over.
[02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:30.900]  And is it for their big plan?
[02:34:30.900 --> 02:34:41.900]  And to just see the corporate media engage in levels of deception that I have never seen before.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:45.900]  They even celebrate on C-SPAN how dumb we are.
[02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:48.900]  Now they're lying to us, look at you dumb little scum.
[02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:53.900]  Oh, we're going to screw you over.
[02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:58.900]  In the movie, Face in the Crowd came out in the 1950s, this is where Andy Griffith got so famous.
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:34:59.900]  Everybody should see it.
[02:34:59.900 --> 02:35:02.900]  He's a con man, becomes this national TV host.
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:08.900]  And during the end of a show, when he thinks the audio is off, he's like, look at you dumb idiots.
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:12.900]  Look at you morons, you don't know I'm screwing you over.
[02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:13.900]  You're such a...
[02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:15.900]  I've never seen that as a kid going, that's mean.
[02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:17.900]  They love him, they support him.
[02:35:17.900 --> 02:35:20.900]  Why would he want to be mean to his fans?
[02:35:20.900 --> 02:35:23.900]  And see, I was so naive when I was younger because I am a good person.
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:26.900]  I mean, I really care about people.
[02:35:26.900 --> 02:35:29.900]  And that's con land, the Rans animal psychology.
[02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:33.900]  The truth is I'm extremely vicious if I need to be.
[02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:35.900]  I'm not bragging, a lot of men are like that.
[02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:40.900]  I'm crazy, I mean, it's just...
[02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:44.900]  But I have an animal side, I'll have a loving side.
[02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:51.900]  And the more predatory a species is, the more it has a big loving side for its own species.
[02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:54.900]  The globalists though, do not have that governor.
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:57.900]  They hate us, they see us as the prey.
[02:35:57.900 --> 02:36:05.900]  And so, I didn't understand criminology when I was 10 years old and first saw Face in the Crowd one night with my mom on TV.
[02:36:05.900 --> 02:36:07.900]  And she said, oh, there's a famous movie coming on, let's watch this.
[02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:10.900]  She let me watch classic films.
[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:16.900]  But then as I grew up and took some criminology classes and actually got to know some criminals and people,
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:20.900]  I realized, my God, they want a brag and they want to screw people over.
[02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:26.900]  And they finally want to get up and go, I screwed you and I'm dishonorable in a piece of filth.
[02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:31.900]  I'm a Nazi collaborator and I'm not sad for all the Jews I helped kill on 60 Minutes.
[02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:35.900]  He actually said that, George Soros.
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:41.900]  And I'm going to fund $35 billion to send out cop killers because I'm a big piece of crap.
[02:36:41.900 --> 02:36:43.900]  And you're like, why does he admit it?
[02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:47.900]  Because he wants you to know he did it to you.
[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:50.900]  If you're not one of them, you don't get it.
[02:36:50.900 --> 02:36:53.900]  That's why good people go, oh, there's not a bunch of corruption and evil.
[02:36:53.900 --> 02:36:57.900]  I mean, come on, nobody would want to do that. Nobody want to act like that.
[02:36:57.900 --> 02:37:00.900]  I'm going to go back to our guest who's an amazing guy and always run over him.
[02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:08.900]  But he also used to come home with the other hosts who are a little bit more sedate sometimes in a good way.
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:14.900]  I just sit here looking at all this and the mainstream media organizing itself to lie
[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:16.900]  and saying, we lie because we're good.
[02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:18.900]  And yeah, we censor you.
[02:37:18.900 --> 02:37:20.900]  And yeah, we're going to start arresting you.
[02:37:20.900 --> 02:37:25.900]  We know best.
[02:37:25.900 --> 02:37:28.900]  And they're just a bunch of dumb, lazy, totalitarians.
[02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:29.900]  They don't have any honor.
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:30.900]  And that's what I realized.
[02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:34.900]  It's the rule of the twisted and the weak, historically.
[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:40.900]  Big armies of nobodies who just get together and decide that, ooh, we found this new thing called evil.
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:42.900]  Wow, we really get ahead with it.
[02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:44.900]  Man, no one ever had this before.
[02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:51.900]  Oh, and they just, they go on these crazy power trips like gremlins and everything burns down.
[02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:53.900]  But I guess in a way it's true.
[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:54.900]  I'm not a social Darwinist.
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:38:03.900]  I'm not a eugenicist, but I see the point, even though they're the ones doing it, that that's how you call all the snot noses.
[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:11.900]  So to all the snot noses, those of us in the Liberty Movement will be the people that will put everything back together historically.
[02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:12.900]  That's a fact.
[02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:13.900]  That's known.
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:17.900]  You are going to be trodden underfoot by your own kind.
[02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:26.900]  And to all the little slimy folks in D.C. and New York and all the other big, globalist combines.
[02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:30.900]  I don't have to give you an intellectual argument, even though I have them or a historical argument.
[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:34.900]  You know deep down, you people, there's no honor amongst thieves.
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:36.900]  When stuff unravels, you are going to be thrown to the side.
[02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:42.900]  Even the richest of you are going to end up in your underground armored fortresses.
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:50.900]  It keeps your redoubts, your strongholds, your little getaway palaces.
[02:38:50.900 --> 02:38:55.900]  Your own security details are going to kill you in your own bunker.
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:56.900]  I haven't talked to them.
[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:59.900]  I know they are.
[02:38:59.900 --> 02:39:02.900]  Because they don't trust you when stuff collapses when they're in there.
[02:39:02.900 --> 02:39:06.900]  They're going to end up occupying your little fortresses.
[02:39:06.900 --> 02:39:11.900]  You're all going to find out how the cow ate the cabbage.
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:16.900]  So everyone will be judged and it's appointed to a man to be born once and to die once.
[02:39:16.900 --> 02:39:19.900]  Nobody gets away from being judged.
[02:39:19.900 --> 02:39:23.900]  Nobody rides for free.
[02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:25.900]  Nobody.
[02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:29.900]  You think because you don't have governors, you're stronger than those of us that do.
[02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:32.900]  You have no idea what we're going to do once this stuff unfolds.
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:35.900]  No idea, Trash!
[02:39:35.900 --> 02:39:37.900]  And we won't sit over you and gloat.
[02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.900]  We'll move on to the next one of you.
[02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:43.900]  Get a job done, a mission done, because we love our children.
[02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:47.900]  Not because we hate humanity.
[02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:52.900]  And they're scared because they can just now begin to feel our fingers psychically,
[02:39:52.900 --> 02:40:00.900]  culturally, economically, tightening around your throats.
[02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:03.900]  Oh, life hates death, doesn't it?
[02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:05.900]  We'll go to our guest here in just a moment.
[02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:09.900]  It's the best of times to try men's souls.
[02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:13.900]  And it is the paradox, the best of times, the worst of times.
[02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:15.900]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:19.900]  We need funds to get more reporters and more riders and to be able to send people more places.
[02:40:19.900 --> 02:40:22.900]  And we have items that everybody needs from water filtration to storeable foods,
[02:40:22.900 --> 02:40:25.900]  to incredibly high quality non-GMO heirloom, open pollinated seeds,
[02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:29.900]  to high mountain organic volcanic coffee.
[02:40:29.900 --> 02:40:35.900]  Free shipping storewide ends today, 40% off brain force, it's about to sell out, get in the next few hours.
[02:40:35.900 --> 02:40:40.900]  40% off Anthroplex, a news flash sale, just today we're running.
[02:40:40.900 --> 02:40:43.900]  And again, there's all the estrogen members, all the garbage out there.
[02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:47.900]  This is put together to be a low-cost, super high-quality formula.
[02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:49.900]  That's what it's designed to do.
[02:40:49.900 --> 02:40:53.900]  At its normal price, it destroys the competition that's upwards of $100.
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:55.900]  It's a third of that.
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:59.900]  Now, it is 40% off for a very limited time, Anthroplex.
[02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:02.900]  Experience it for yourself.
[02:41:02.900 --> 02:41:04.900]  Quite frankly, I can't even take one every day.
[02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:06.900]  A lot of people take three or four of them.
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:10.900]  But this does not mimic testosterone, folks.
[02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:13.900]  According to Dr. Grips research, what it does is it's known concentrated organic herbs
[02:41:13.900 --> 02:41:17.900]  that go in and basically block all the garbage that's blocking your testosterone.
[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:19.900]  Supermobiltality is amazing as well.
[02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:22.900]  It's the cold press, supercharged version, but it costs more.
[02:41:22.900 --> 02:41:28.900]  They're both excellent. M4warslife.com, M4warsstore.com, Recultural Free, 888-253-3139.
[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:31.900]  We've got a new special that's only supposing it'll run for one day.
[02:41:31.900 --> 02:41:33.900]  But I haven't even plugged it.
[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:34.900]  I don't have time.
[02:41:34.900 --> 02:41:36.900]  And I want to give Mr. Schneider the balance of the hour.
[02:41:36.900 --> 02:41:37.900]  He's got so much to talk about.
[02:41:37.900 --> 02:41:38.900]  I'm just going to let him host.
[02:41:38.900 --> 02:41:40.900]  And of course, you can visit his website as well.
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:42.900]  But I'm just really getting angry.
[02:41:42.900 --> 02:41:44.900]  I mean, I feel like I'm not doing a good job during the break.
[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:45.900]  So I come in here and blow up.
[02:41:45.900 --> 02:41:46.900]  That's what happened.
[02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:47.900]  See, it's not fake.
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:51.900]  I mean, I'm desperate here because we were where we could win.
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:54.900]  But if we don't, the stakes are so bad.
[02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:59.900]  We've got the best solar controllers and solar panel units out there at the price.
[02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:02.900]  We went on years researching what's the best.
[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:03.900]  And then it gets upgraded every year.
[02:42:03.900 --> 02:42:04.900]  It's better and better.

[02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:10.900]  And it's one of the few things that we don't sell a lot of.
[02:42:10.900 --> 02:42:12.900]  So the trolls can give it bad reviews.
[02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:14.900]  But I've been told by folks that are into them.
[02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:16.900]  Most of us have five-star reviews.
[02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:19.900]  The trolls don't sell a lot or able to go in and do fake reviews and then return them.
[02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:22.900]  It's dirty tricks they do, but it's an amazing system.

[02:42:34.900 --> 02:42:35.900]  That's a game changer.
[02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:36.900]  Check it out.
[02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:37.900]  Okay.
[02:42:37.900 --> 02:42:39.900]  I am ranting Michael Snyder of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:42:39.900 --> 02:42:40.900]  Get into the economy.
[02:42:40.900 --> 02:42:41.900]  Get into the dirty tricks.
[02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:42.900]  Get into the elite.
[02:42:42.900 --> 02:42:45.900]  They have a world collapse program to bring them into power.
[02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:46.900]  That's their own mission.
[02:42:46.900 --> 02:42:50.900]  But it's, as one of our guests Matt Bracken says, it's one thing to claim you're going to ride the tiger.
[02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:51.900]  It's another thing to actually do it.
[02:42:51.900 --> 02:42:53.900]  You've got the floor for the next 18 minutes.
[02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:54.900]  Go ahead.
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:55.900]  Okay.
[02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:56.900]  Yeah.
[02:42:56.900 --> 02:43:02.900]  Alex, certainly we hear in the United States actually things are better in terms of economically,
[02:43:02.900 --> 02:43:05.900]  financially, than almost everywhere else in the world.
[02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:06.900]  The things are still not great here.
[02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:11.900]  We're still seeing kind of the long-term decline, the long-term destruction of the middle class
[02:43:11.900 --> 02:43:13.900]  that we've been seeing for decades.
[02:43:13.900 --> 02:43:15.900]  But it's kind of an acceleration.
[02:43:15.900 --> 02:43:20.900]  Freedom created so much wealth that even though they've been sucking office for decades, we're still number one.
[02:43:20.900 --> 02:43:21.900]  Go ahead.
[02:43:21.900 --> 02:43:22.900]  Yeah.
[02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:24.900]  We just got a brand new number on home ownership.
[02:43:24.900 --> 02:43:32.900]  And just here, just recently, the rate of home ownership in the United States has fallen every single year while Barack Obama's been on office.
[02:43:32.900 --> 02:43:36.900]  But just here recently, it hit the lowest level ever measured.
[02:43:36.900 --> 02:43:41.900]  In other words, the percentage of Americans that actually own their own home is the smallest this ever been.
[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:45.900]  And so the middle class is shrinking in fact in 2015.
[02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:50.900]  Last year, we learned for the very first time in American history, the middle class has become a minority.
[02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:56.900]  And so if you add up all the wealthy people and all the poor people, which has been exploding, you add them together.
[02:43:56.900 --> 02:43:59.900]  They outnumber the middle class now for the first time ever.
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:02.900]  So we're seeing the middle class is being destroyed.
[02:44:02.900 --> 02:44:10.900]  Meanwhile, in the corporate world, we're seeing all kinds of things similar to what we saw in 2008 where we record profits by these inside bastards.
[02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:11.900]  Look at this one.
[02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:14.900]  The rich get richer as billionaires increase the number.
[02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:15.900]  Yeah.
[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:16.900]  Yeah.
[02:44:16.900 --> 02:44:19.900]  But now corporations are starting to fall on harder times.
[02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:23.900]  For example, corporate earnings are now down for five months in a row.
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:27.900]  So corporations are totally agree with you that corporations in general are getting screwed.
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:30.900]  But the mega ones on the insider group, they're doing great.
[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:31.900]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:31.900 --> 02:44:32.900]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:32.900 --> 02:44:36.900]  But a lot of the ones that aren't in the insider group, they're getting into trouble.
[02:44:36.900 --> 02:44:38.900]  They're getting behind on their debts.
[02:44:38.900 --> 02:44:42.900]  Corporate debt delinquencies are the highest they've been since the crisis of 2008.
[02:44:42.900 --> 02:44:47.900]  Corporate debt defaults, those that are actually defaulting on their debts, the highest.
[02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:51.900]  And isn't that the canary in the coal mine is corporate defaults because they know first.
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:52.900]  Yeah.
[02:44:52.900 --> 02:45:00.900]  Well, we're seeing a huge problems in the energy industry, of course, with the price of oil just going through the floor falling again here just recently.
[02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:04.900]  More than 20% since early June, the price of oil has tumbled.
[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:07.900]  And so this is putting renewed stress on the energy industry.
[02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:14.900]  And people might say, well, I can go to the gas station, get cheaper gas, but it's killing jobs since mid 2014.
[02:45:14.900 --> 02:45:21.900]  We've lost 195,000 energy jobs, good paying energy jobs in the United States alone.
[02:45:21.900 --> 02:45:25.900]  And these are the kind of middle class jobs, which we actually need to have a middle class.
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:35.900]  I mean, you can't replace an oil field job and energy job with, you know, even a whole bunch of part time jobs stocking the shelves at Walmart.
[02:45:35.900 --> 02:45:38.900]  You know, if we're going to have a thriving middle class, we need middle class jobs.
[02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:50.900]  So, and then this crash in the price of oil is also putting pressure on financial institutions all over Wall Street that are heavily involved in the energy industry with making them loans with derivatives with everything else.
[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:57.900]  So this renewed crash in the price of oil is putting renewed stress on the financial markets and all over the world.
[02:45:57.900 --> 02:46:03.900]  And here in the United States, you know, we've got our too big to fail banks, but overseas it's even worse over.
[02:46:03.900 --> 02:46:08.900]  So what is your prediction? What's the real state of the global economy, mega recession or depression?
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:12.900]  Well, much of the global economy has already fallen into recession.
[02:46:12.900 --> 02:46:17.900]  The U.S. is actually in better shape than almost everyone else in the world.
[02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:20.900]  I mean, you look at the country hosting the Olympics right now, Brazil.
[02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:23.900]  They were the seventh largest economy on the planet.
[02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:29.900]  Now they've fallen down to ninth because they're in their worst economic depression since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:35.900]  In fact, CNN ran an article not too long ago where they said Brazil economic collapse worse than feared.
[02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:41.900]  So CNN is actually admitting that Brazil is experiencing an economic collapse.
[02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:43.900]  Their infrastructure is falling down.
[02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:44.900]  What about Venezuela?
[02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:47.900]  Yeah, Venezuela is right next door to Brazil.
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:48.900]  We're in Venezuela.
[02:46:48.900 --> 02:46:52.900]  I just posted an article about this just a few days ago.
[02:46:52.900 --> 02:46:59.900]  Where in Venezuela, some people were so desperate for food that they actually broke into a zoo and had been taking the zoo animals.
[02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:08.900]  And at first they started with the sheep and the pigs, but then they actually pulled a black stallion out of the cage and slaughtered it for meat because they were so hungry.
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:16.900]  And not too long ago, just a few months ago, one of a mayor down there in Venezuela came out and said people in his area are killing.
[02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:20.900]  They're hunting down dogs and cats and pigeons for food.
[02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:24.900]  Yeah, people's pets are being gobbled up.
[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:27.900]  Yeah, and there's not money to feed the pets anyway.
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:30.900]  Not money to feed the animals in the zoo.
[02:47:30.900 --> 02:47:34.900]  Something to go on with the zoo story is that they're breaking in and killing these animals.
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:38.900]  But more animals have actually died from starvation in the zoo.
[02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:39.900]  There's dozens of animals.
[02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:40.900]  It's better to eat them.
[02:47:40.900 --> 02:47:41.900]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:47:41.900 --> 02:47:43.900]  How is it going for the globalists?
[02:47:43.900 --> 02:47:46.900]  Because they admitted they wanted to have a worldwide economic collapse to consolidate control.
[02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:49.900]  But it doesn't look like it's going the way they wanted it to.
[02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:52.900]  Yeah, well, the globalists are not all powerful.
[02:47:52.900 --> 02:47:55.900]  But yeah, they would like to accelerate their program.
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:48:00.900]  Now here in the United States, they'd like to keep things together long enough to make sure Trump doesn't get in.
[02:48:00.900 --> 02:48:04.900]  But globally, they do want to accelerate their new world order.
[02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:06.900]  But there's been a rebellion among the people.
[02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:15.900]  We saw the Brexit vote where the people of the United Kingdom, you know, Great Britain said, well, no, we don't want to be part of the European Union.
[02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:19.900]  It was a rebuke to globalism, which I think kind of stunned the globalists.
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:25.900]  So I think that set their program a bit and on a number of fronts around the world.
[02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:31.900]  Well, they've said in the Washington Post, they've said in the Financial Times, everywhere, globalism is in crisis, the worst threat ever.
[02:48:31.900 --> 02:48:44.900]  But aren't these animals like bears and black stallions being eaten horses indicative of, quite frankly, huge cities collapsing are like locusts where within 10 days,
[02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:45.900]  most people become cannibals.
[02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:53.900]  I mean, if we have a global societal collapse anywhere near the Great Depression, it is going to be spectacular.
[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:55.900]  Yeah, desperate people do desperate things.
[02:48:55.900 --> 02:49:04.900]  And here in the United States, we're not too far away where one recent survey found 62% of all Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.
[02:49:04.900 --> 02:49:12.900]  And so when things and other surveys have found over half the country have less than a three day supply of non perishable food and supplies at home.
[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:18.900]  So when things get really, really bad, you know, about more than half the country is going to be desperate really, really quick.
[02:49:18.900 --> 02:49:22.900]  So, you know, all things still are at least relatively stable for the moment.
[02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:23.900]  Now's not the time to party.
[02:49:23.900 --> 02:49:24.900]  Now's the time to get prepared.
[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:29.900]  So I would encourage people, you're telling, you know, encouraging people to support info wars earlier.
[02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:31.900]  Well, you know, people, you know, they tune in every day.
[02:49:31.900 --> 02:49:33.900]  They listen hour after hour after hour.
[02:49:33.900 --> 02:49:36.900]  But many of them have never financially supported you.
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:39.900]  You know, they'll go out and spend hundreds of dollars with new world order companies.
[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:42.900]  But, you know, why not support Alex Jones?
[02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:43.900]  Absolutely.
[02:49:43.900 --> 02:49:47.900]  And it's important to get on the collapse blog.com and Mr. Snyder said, but I want to be point blank with you.
[02:49:47.900 --> 02:49:56.900]  I got on talk radio 21 years ago and they said, look with conservatives and people and conservative talk radio host, you know, swarable foods are a really big thing.
[02:49:56.900 --> 02:49:58.900]  And I'm like, what's durable food?
[02:49:58.900 --> 02:49:59.900]  I mean, yeah, grandma can some stuff.
[02:49:59.900 --> 02:50:01.900]  You know, they believe in it.
[02:50:01.900 --> 02:50:02.900]  A lot of your listeners are Mormon.
[02:50:02.900 --> 02:50:04.900]  You know, we got some Mormon sponsors.
[02:50:04.900 --> 02:50:09.900]  I was like, okay, folks, you should have food for a storm or an earthquake or a crisis.
[02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:11.900]  Hopefully you never need it, but it's insurance.
[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:12.900]  You could eat.
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:13.900]  And that was always a staple sponsor.
[02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:15.900]  People know I've never been a huge food pusher.
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:20.900]  Even I thought Y2K was a fraud till the last few weeks with me was like, oh, it's all going to happen.
[02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:22.900]  But, but regardless, you know, you got to find your operations.
[02:50:22.900 --> 02:50:23.900]  You try to find it with moral stuff.
[02:50:23.900 --> 02:50:25.900]  You know, selling foods is a good thing.
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:31.900]  But I mean, tell you, I mean, now I've been selling a ton of food and the listeners are buying it because we're all getting.
[02:50:31.900 --> 02:50:33.900]  I mean, I have been putting solar panels here.
[02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:35.900]  Gas power generators here at my house.
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:36.900]  Panels.
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:47.900]  I've been getting the old farmhouse ready in East Texas because collapse is gone from possibility to possibility to near certainty.
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:49.900]  I mean, I like it.
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.900]  I like it.
[02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:51.900]  Mountains, which are islands.
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:55.900]  So there's an ocean of tyranny and corruption and death and starvation rising.
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:57.900]  And we're up way up here on a tall mountain.
[02:50:57.900 --> 02:50:58.900]  But you know what?
[02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:00.900]  I see that water getting closer and closer and closer.
[02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:03.900]  We had a house by the lake when I was a kid.
[02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:07.900]  And I mean, we weren't on right on the water.
[02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:13.900]  We were, we were the houses up from the water on a hill, probably a hundred feet above the water.
[02:51:13.900 --> 02:51:18.900]  But, you know, with the grade, maybe, maybe a thousand yards from the water.
[02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:24.900]  And I remember horrible floods where it kept raining and finally the water came up, up, up, up, up, up, up the back porch in the house.
[02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:30.900]  And pretty soon we were moving furniture upstairs, two-story, into it.
[02:51:30.900 --> 02:51:33.900]  And it just, they had to put a sheet rock, everything, and it ruined the bottom of the house.
[02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:36.900]  And who would have ever thought that water would have gotten all the way up there?
[02:51:36.900 --> 02:51:37.900]  Oh, it's going to flood.
[02:51:37.900 --> 02:51:41.900]  We watched it in the weeks of raining come right up to us like Noah's flood.
[02:51:41.900 --> 02:51:46.900]  And now I've gone from seeing the water way down there again in my life being tyranny and collapse.
[02:51:46.900 --> 02:51:48.900]  It's now lapping my back porch.
[02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:49.900]  And I'm not like, oh, good.
[02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:50.900]  I was right.
[02:51:50.900 --> 02:51:54.900]  I'm like, oh, my God, is it going to go just to the first floor, Michael Snyder?
[02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:58.900]  Or how high is this water going to go if we have a worldwide collapse?
[02:51:58.900 --> 02:51:59.900]  Well, I hope you're listeners.
[02:51:59.900 --> 02:52:05.900]  I hope everyone can see that we're reaching a pressure point, especially as we come up to the election here.
[02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:10.900]  I think this is a key moment that unlike anything we've seen in years.
[02:52:10.900 --> 02:52:16.900]  And if the more support Donald Trump gets, the more pressure the elite are going to feel to do something.
[02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:21.900]  You know, Barack Obama, he just came out the other day and said, oh, Donald Trump's unfit to be president.
[02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:27.900]  He said, oh, you know, I always thought John McCain or Mitt Romney, if they won the election, that they could have functioned as president.
[02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:29.900]  He said, with Donald Trump, that's not the case.
[02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:32.900]  Now, Barack Obama really means that?
[02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:37.900]  Will he willingly and peacefully transfer over power if Donald Trump wins the election?
[02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:39.900]  Someone needs to ask him that question.
[02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:42.900]  If Barack Obama actually means all these things he's been saying about Donald Trump.
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:46.900]  If he says he's unfit, will you say he's unfit?
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:49.900]  And so will you transfer power if he's elected?
[02:52:49.900 --> 02:52:51.900]  Yeah. And so someone needs to ask him about that.
[02:52:51.900 --> 02:52:57.900]  But also as we get closer to the election and the closer the polls are, the more support Donald Trump has.
[02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:00.900]  If it looks like it's going to be closer, Donald Trump may win.
[02:53:00.900 --> 02:53:11.900]  We need to be on the alert for false flags, some type of crisis, something that will bring a disruption to the paradigm, something that will derail.
[02:53:11.900 --> 02:53:15.900]  Because, you know, the elite don't want to take any chances.
[02:53:15.900 --> 02:53:27.900]  So, you know, we need to be on alert because, like I said, this is a pressure point which could cause the elite to overplay their hand to show who they really are and to do desperate things.
[02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:32.900]  Well, I agree. And look, they have the shadowy AP group that always announces the elections.
[02:53:32.900 --> 02:53:35.900]  They keep getting caught defrauding people so they keep changing the name.
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:37.900]  They're the ones that called it for Sanders and all those states they really won.
[02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:40.900]  And that's even a New York Daily News and Zero Hedge.
[02:53:40.900 --> 02:53:44.900]  So, I put a 12-minute report together and I'm begging everyone.
[02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:46.900]  I don't want the credit. I don't care.
[02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:49.900]  Quite frankly, it gets so dangerous to always be the one at the tip of the spear.
[02:53:49.900 --> 02:53:53.900]  When we look at Trump, 48 hours after I said, you know, come out with all the fraud, he did, word for word.
[02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:58.900]  And, you know, I know for sure he got it from me, but I was leaving it at that.
[02:53:58.900 --> 02:54:06.900]  We need everybody to make this the big central issue so the establishment understands we're not just going to go quietly into the night.
[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:09.900]  Yeah, absolutely. And everyone has a way that they can contribute.
[02:54:09.900 --> 02:54:15.900]  Now, what I do is...
[02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:17.900]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:20.900]  You're fine. We might have been sending you audio from that video.
[02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:21.900]  Sorry, Shanon, go ahead.
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:24.900]  Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I got...
[02:54:24.900 --> 02:54:26.900]  But yeah, everyone needs to contribute.
[02:54:26.900 --> 02:54:28.900]  And now's not a time to sit on the sidelines.
[02:54:28.900 --> 02:54:30.900]  Now, personally, what can I do?
[02:54:30.900 --> 02:54:34.900]  You know, I live in the middle of nowhere up in the mountains, but what I can do is write.
[02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:38.900]  And so I've been gifted with writing and I write and it makes an impact out there.
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:40.900]  No, wait, let me interrupt you. You...
[02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:43.900]  I don't know your numbers, but I see your stuff everywhere.
[02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:46.900]  Let me guess. Let me be conservative.
[02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:50.900]  What do you get? A million, two million individual readers a month?
[02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:57.900]  Yeah, on my one website alone, the economicclassblog.com alone gets more than a million page impressions each month.
[02:54:57.900 --> 02:54:58.900]  And that's just one of my...
[02:54:58.900 --> 02:55:01.900]  Okay, so let me stop you. And you've been around, what, six, seven years?
[02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:05.900]  Yeah, since the economic class blog since late 2009.
[02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:09.900]  Okay, so let me just go on from memory. We'll just test it out. That's my little noggin' here.
[02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:13.900]  Teleprompter free, folks. Powered by 1776.
[02:55:13.900 --> 02:55:22.900]  See, this one I'm saying, there's such a vacuum of real news and info that we don't have to let them just kill the economy and then sit there and beg them.
[02:55:22.900 --> 02:55:24.900]  If we build it, they will come.
[02:55:24.900 --> 02:55:30.900]  But you had to hammer and hammer and hammer, tell the truth, engage in good analysis, have people trust you, do a great job.
[02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:36.900]  Now, you're all over talk radio, you're doing your own shows, you're reaching on, you got like three, four websites reaching a couple million people a month.
[02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:40.900]  I was guessing, I guess, it's higher than that. And that's the success story.
[02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:47.900]  And that's the great thing about this is that we are better than the globalist if we get in the arena. Go ahead.
[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:55.900]  Oh, yeah. And my point is that anyone can do it because, you know, you go back a decade, I was about as anonymous as you could possibly get.
[02:55:55.900 --> 02:56:04.900]  I was working in the heart of DC, kind of in the heart of darkness there, but I would put on my little headphones while I was working when I could and listen to Alex Jones and be like, well, what could I do?
[02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:11.900]  I'm nobody, but I took action and I stuck with it at first, you know, a very, very little impact at all.
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:14.900]  But I stuck with it and over time it built up.
[02:56:14.900 --> 02:56:20.900]  I was about to say, though, that's what I want. I didn't even know that we help spur you to do the things you do and you reach so many people in there.
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:26.900]  I'm not so influential now, Mr. Steiner, but that was my goal is to get other men and women that love liberty to take action and it's happening.
[02:56:26.900 --> 02:56:31.900]  Look how many new great minds there are in the fight every week. I can't even keep track of all these great people.
[02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:38.900]  And a lot of them get butthurt and they email me or call and I can't call them back and think I'm, you know, you know, think that, you know, they're, you know, their progenitor doesn't like them.
[02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:49.900]  Believe me, we're all in this fight together. I mean, I felt bad we had this amazing reporter we're hiring here last week and I was so busy, so freaked out fighting the globalist with such responsibility that I was even saying hi to people.
[02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:56.900]  It's because I just get so immersed in this folks, but it is the joy of battle. Just commit to it and go with it. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:56.900 --> 02:57:02.900]  Oh, I totally agree with you, Alex. You know, Alex Jones is only one person. Michael Snyder is only one person, but we all have guests.
[02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:11.900]  We all can do something. We're all great at something. And so whether it's free protests, whether it's YouTube videos, whether it's writing books, whatever it is to contribute to the fight.
[02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:20.900]  It's almost the time because we've reached the culmination of history of this fight against the New World Order and this election with Donald Trump is such a key time.
[02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:22.900]  Everyone needs to get off the sidelines.
[02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:31.900]  Sure. Let me ask you this. Why do you think they're so arrogant suddenly going on TV and going, we lie to you? Bring the college kids in and teach them how to lie at the State Department.
[02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:36.900]  Is that an attempt to just normalize it? Is that desperateness or is that the mental illness of criminality?
[02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:48.900]  Well, it really is a mental illness. I was around these people when I was in law school and when I was in DC, and they really do believe that they are better than the rest of us, that they know better, the elite know better than the rest of us.
[02:57:48.900 --> 02:57:53.900]  And so, and they think, you know, they regard us as a bunch of sheep, as a bunch of children.
[02:57:53.900 --> 02:58:00.900]  And it starts with them with bodyguards and then they want to take our guns. No assholes. No, you're not getting our guns.
[02:58:00.900 --> 02:58:09.900]  Yeah. And, you know, and they've got control of the media. You know, the average American watches television approximately five hours a day.
[02:58:09.900 --> 02:58:16.900]  And when you add in all other electronic devices, it's about 10 hours a day. Americans are connected to something.
[02:58:16.900 --> 02:58:23.900]  And virtually all of that of the news and entertainment and media that Americans consume is controlled by the big...
[02:58:23.900 --> 02:58:31.900]  There is a war in cyberspace. They're trying to censor us more and more because we're winning, but they've miscalculated. I'm telling you, the tide's turning.
[02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:35.900]  Michael Snyder, do five more minutes with us. Then we're going to hand the baton of the next host coming up.
[02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:39.900]  And then Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock central. I'm Alex Jones. The war is now.
[02:58:39.900 --> 02:58:40.900]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:40.900 --> 02:58:49.900]  We're listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:49.900 --> 02:58:56.900]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:58:56.900 --> 02:59:02.900]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:59:02.900 --> 02:59:11.900]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:59:11.900 --> 02:59:16.900]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[02:59:16.900 --> 02:59:26.900]  Do the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects themselves.
[02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:28.900]  The general public doesn't.
[02:59:28.900 --> 02:59:32.900]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:59:32.900 --> 02:59:36.900]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:42.900]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:47.900]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, then fullwarstore.com.
[03:00:13.900 --> 03:00:19.900]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[03:00:19.900 --> 03:00:24.900]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.900 --> 03:00:32.900]  You can feel the animating contest of liberty like our earthquake.
[03:00:32.900 --> 03:00:34.900]  Ten on a Richter scale beneath us.
[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:36.900]  The world's never going to be the same.
[03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:42.900]  I wanted to read this quote just from final comments. Mr. Schneider, David Knight's coming up with a full roster.
[03:00:42.900 --> 03:00:47.900]  We're going to talk about, did Bill Marge's Lown TV, about one million contribution he made?
[03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:53.900]  Trump, anonymous, new plan, Trump economics, excuse me.
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:00:58.900]  And we're talking about the speech he just gave in Detroit and a lot more with David Knight.
[03:00:58.900 --> 03:01:03.900]  But first, this quote that I should read more and more here on air by Teddy Roosevelt.
[03:01:03.900 --> 03:01:08.900]  It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles or,
[03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:12.900]  and then it just goes on because it's printed wrong.
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:16.900]  It's not the critic who counts, nor the man who points out how the strongman stumbles,
[03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:19.900]  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:22.900]  The credit belongs to the man who was actually in the arena,
[03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:27.900]  whose face is marred by dust, sweat, and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs,
[03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:31.900]  who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming,
[03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:34.900]  but who does actually strive through the deeds,
[03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:37.900]  and who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions,
[03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:43.900]  who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,
[03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:46.900]  or at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
[03:01:46.900 --> 03:01:52.900]  so that his place shall never be with those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:55.900]  And it's like, take Michael Zimmerman.
[03:01:55.900 --> 03:02:00.900]  He was up here till midnight last night, putting together the two reports we shot.
[03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:03.900]  But he'll see millions of people see what he put together with myself.
[03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:07.900]  And that's what it takes, is the total commitment.
[03:02:07.900 --> 03:02:12.900]  And I'll tell you, stuff's so hot right now, I can't keep myself from working seven days a week.
[03:02:12.900 --> 03:02:16.900]  And then I catch myself sometimes like 10 or 11 working, kind of bumbling around.
[03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:18.900]  I'm like, okay, you got to go to bed.
[03:02:18.900 --> 03:02:20.900]  And it's because this is history happening.
[03:02:20.900 --> 03:02:25.900]  Mr. Schneider, in closing, I think we are at that historical crossroads right now.
[03:02:25.900 --> 03:02:30.900]  And so it's just wonderful that we're in this fraternity, regardless of race, color, creed, religion,
[03:02:30.900 --> 03:02:34.900]  of being pro-human, because to be anti-globalist is to be pro-human.
[03:02:34.900 --> 03:02:36.900]  Final comments.
[03:02:36.900 --> 03:02:38.900]  Oh, I totally agree with you, Alex.
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:44.900]  If people are watching or listening today, I want them to know you are born for such a time as this.
[03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:48.900]  We talk about a lot of hard things out there, bad things that are happening.
[03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:51.900]  And yeah, things are going to get really, really challenging already.
[03:02:51.900 --> 03:02:55.900]  Banks come apart all around the world. Deutsche Bank, the biggest bank in Germany,
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:59.900]  is collapsing their stock prices hit another record low.
[03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:02.900]  And that's going to be an event three or four times bigger than Lehman Brothers.
[03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:04.900]  And all these things are happening.
[03:03:04.900 --> 03:03:06.900]  Events are accelerating around the world.
[03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:10.900]  But now is not a time to go get a shovel and try to dig a hole and hide from the world.
[03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:15.900]  Now is a time to stand up, because it's when times are the darkest that the greatest heroes are needed.
[03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:19.900]  And during the times that are coming are going to be incredibly challenging.
[03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:25.900]  It's a time for heroes. It's a time for people to raise up, be the people they were created to be,
[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:30.900]  stand strong, make our forefathers, those who founded this country proud,
[03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:34.900]  stand up against this globalist scum as Alex loves to call them.
[03:03:34.900 --> 03:03:37.900]  And we're going to write a chapter in American history,
[03:03:37.900 --> 03:03:40.900]  unlike any other chapter that's ever been written.
[03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:45.900]  And so I would encourage people, just don't rely on Alex Jones or Michael Snyder,
[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:49.900]  it's time for you to rise up, you to raise action, because we're not going to bend,
[03:03:49.900 --> 03:03:53.900]  we're not going to bow, we're not going to kneel before these globalists.
[03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:55.900]  But we're going to stand up.
[03:03:55.900 --> 03:04:02.900]  And even if some of us end up dying, we're going to stand tall.
[03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:10.900]  And people are going to look back and say, wow, that was a generation that really responded to the call
[03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:13.900]  and stood strong when they needed to stand strong.
[03:04:13.900 --> 03:04:18.900]  And that's what Gandhi said, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[03:04:18.900 --> 03:04:21.900]  We're now reaching the phase where the New York Times goes, let's just shut everybody down.
[03:04:21.900 --> 03:04:24.900]  Let's shut the web down, let's start arresting people.
[03:04:24.900 --> 03:04:27.900]  Solances will just arrest Alex Jones.
[03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:29.900]  And then the next article, how pedophilia is good.
[03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:32.900]  They're just, they've run the white flag up to just everything.
[03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:36.900]  These are evil, fallen people that just cozy up to every form of wickedness.
[03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:40.900]  The website's economiclabsblog.com. Mr. Snyder, thank you so much.
[03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:41.900]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:04:41.900 --> 03:04:43.900]  All right, we're going to be right back.
[03:04:43.900 --> 03:04:47.900]  I'm going to read a few quotes here and then hand the baton to our own David Knight, fresh in the bullpen,
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:51.900]  ready to take the calm in the fight against the New World Order.
[03:04:51.900 --> 03:04:56.900]  There's a video on infowars.com where Obama slipped up and started a secret group that runs elections.
[03:04:56.900 --> 03:05:22.900]  Please get that video out, it's key.
[03:05:22.900 --> 03:05:26.900]  After the former Secretary of State discussed his situation in plain text email,
[03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:31.900]  in response to the controversy, Senator Tom Cotton said Hillary's recklessness could have easily caused the death of the scientist.
[03:05:31.900 --> 03:05:39.900]  He said, quote, that goes to show just how reckless and careless her decision was to put that kind of highly classified information on a private server.
[03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:42.900]  And I think her judgment is not suited to keep this country safe.
[03:05:42.900 --> 03:05:47.900]  And remember, Hillary Clinton repeatedly lied about sending classified information over her home email server
[03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:54.900]  and continued to suggest she never did such a thing even after the FBI investigation concluded that's exactly what she did.
[03:05:54.900 --> 03:06:22.900]  And to find out more, visit infowars.com. This is Get Daniels Reporting.
[03:06:22.900 --> 03:06:30.900]  In the history of infowars life, we brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMell Vitality and so many others.
[03:06:30.900 --> 03:06:39.900]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[03:06:39.900 --> 03:06:44.900]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:51.900]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:56.900]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure. That's infowarslife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:07:22.900]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:48.900]  We'll be right back.
[03:07:48.900 --> 03:08:11.900]  We'll be right back.
[03:08:11.900 --> 03:08:29.900]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:42.900]  David Knight is in here with me and he's going to start taking over in the next segment for the balance of transmission.
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:09:00.900]  Let's talk about some of what you've got coming up today because I was unaware of this new Bill Maher controversy during the break.
[03:09:00.900 --> 03:09:12.900]  The very interesting exchange was to talk about whether or not WikiLeaks is going to come after Donald Trump and reveal his income tax returns and he said kind of jokingly,
[03:09:12.900 --> 03:09:19.900]  well, we're looking into it and then they walked that back and they said, no, we encourage whistleblowers, we don't investigate individuals.
[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:31.900]  The key thing that came up after that, Alex, was the fact that he had done some research because Bill Maher starts being very aggressive with him, saying, you've got your thumb on the scale to try to get Donald Trump elected.
[03:09:31.900 --> 03:09:41.900]  Then he goes, well, it's interesting. We looked up and we found a William Maher in LA who donated a million dollars to a Clinton connected entity.
[03:09:41.900 --> 03:09:52.900]  Did you do that? And he said, well, I gave a million dollars to Obama four years ago, but that's not me. And if you look at it, there's only three Bill Maher's in LA.
[03:09:52.900 --> 03:09:54.900]  And who's got that type of money?
[03:09:54.900 --> 03:09:58.900]  Yeah, exactly. Nobody else has that kind of money except for Bill Maher. So the question is,
[03:09:58.900 --> 03:10:01.900]  God knows I don't. How much is that little piece of crap made?
[03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:05.900]  Yeah, well, he just signed a million dollar donation.
[03:10:05.900 --> 03:10:12.900]  He just signed a new multi-year contract that's made his net worth of being in the low 20s to the high 20s and millions.
[03:10:12.900 --> 03:10:16.900]  But that's the key is that they always deflect this away.
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:19.900]  And I think we're going to start calling it the fame stream media.
[03:10:19.900 --> 03:10:21.900]  You know, we talk about the mainstream media, the mainstream media.
[03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:29.900]  This is the fame stream media because they're constantly going to these actors who apparently we should care what they think more than anybody else.
[03:10:29.900 --> 03:10:33.900]  And we should allow them to put their thumbs on the scale.
[03:10:33.900 --> 03:10:36.900]  I know he really lied to him. It's not even the Hill says he's been caught.
[03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:39.900]  Yeah, I mean, it's him. You're being nice. It's him. The Hill says it's him.
[03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:46.900]  He's lying to his viewers. He knows it's going to come out. He thinks he knows they know maybe 10% actually read newspapers.
[03:10:46.900 --> 03:10:50.900]  That's its own propaganda, but it's higher level down lower.
[03:10:50.900 --> 03:10:52.900]  It's just all about a confidence game.
[03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:58.900]  Look, my tie is skinnier and fancier and I look more conservative and I have a better set.
[03:10:58.900 --> 03:11:04.900]  So I'm going to tell you that you can just believe me. So that's that. That's fascinating. You're going to cover that and a lot more.
[03:11:04.900 --> 03:11:06.900]  I got to tell you, I've got a New York Times article here.
[03:11:06.900 --> 03:11:13.900]  I mentioned the Billy Corgan actually told me about this morning where they actually say it's time to just start lying about Trump and just his credit opposition and shut him down.
[03:11:13.900 --> 03:11:18.900]  They're now organizing, engaging basically in criminal activity.
[03:11:18.900 --> 03:11:24.900]  And now Alexa that for two years has censored all Patriot sites and says we have no traffic even though it's skyrocketing.
[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:31.900]  And that's the bankrupt people with advertising. Thank God we saw that before they did it and moved our own funding by direct sales.
[03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:36.900]  But they got the Justice Department looking at trying to shut us down for that. Yes, folks.
[03:11:36.900 --> 03:11:41.900]  So I mean, this is a war, but just the fact that they would even try this.
[03:11:41.900 --> 03:11:49.900]  And now Alexa is going to run this little hub thing Amazon in your house that tracks everything digitally going on in your home.
[03:11:49.900 --> 03:11:51.900]  And you're going to talk to it like it's your friend, like Siri.
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:54.900]  Yeah. Yeah. Won't that be fun? That's the thing that we need to do.
[03:11:54.900 --> 03:12:04.900]  Bring a robot into your house that works for a big giant multinational corporation like Facebook or like Amazon and let it spy on you and the terms of service admit it's spying.
[03:12:04.900 --> 03:12:09.900]  Every day we see more information being admitted to by the large corporations that they're spying on us directly.
[03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:12.900]  Well, they don't see, they're not Apple with the phone. That's right.
[03:12:12.900 --> 03:12:14.900]  Or they're not Samsung with the droid. That's right.
[03:12:14.900 --> 03:12:20.900]  So they've got to get their little robot in. Oh, look, it's a good deal for you. Oh, look, it's pretty.
[03:12:20.900 --> 03:12:22.900]  But it's spying on everything you do.
[03:12:22.900 --> 03:12:24.900]  As William Benny has pointed out. Oh, there you go.
[03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:27.900]  It's not even recording. Oh, there it is.
[03:12:27.900 --> 03:12:31.900]  Oh, here we have another one. Oh, here. Oh, nothing. Nothing to worry about here, Mr. Gopher.
[03:12:31.900 --> 03:12:33.900]  My plastic explosives or anything.
[03:12:33.900 --> 03:12:34.900]  Yeah, there you go.
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:37.900]  You know, that's from, sorry, you know, that's from Caddyshack.
[03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:39.900]  Oh yeah, Caddyshack, your favorite. That's right.
[03:12:39.900 --> 03:12:44.900]  But you know, Alex, William Benny said it's not even the recorded conversations.
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:46.900]  Of course, yeah, they are recording your conversations.
[03:12:46.900 --> 03:12:49.900]  They are listening to you, but it's the metadata that they get.
[03:12:49.900 --> 03:12:51.900]  And Alex, this all feeds into this.
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:59.900]  And of course, there's this, as we look at, very uncomfortable coalition going on between the large corporations as always.
[03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:03.900]  They're the ones who are getting the preferred treatment, the regulations that they come out with.
[03:13:03.900 --> 03:13:11.900]  I've got an article here about New England fishermen that are going to be shut down because they're going to have to pay for their own monitors to inspect the fish that are there.
[03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:13.900]  This is something that's always been done in the past.
[03:13:13.900 --> 03:13:18.900]  And by the way, by the way, this has already been done everywhere in the third world from Burma to Mexico.
[03:13:18.900 --> 03:13:20.900]  So you know who victims are?
[03:13:20.900 --> 03:13:24.900]  It is all these super hardworking Mexicans you see here forced up here.
[03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:26.900]  Everybody goes, it makes fun of them.
[03:13:26.900 --> 03:13:31.900]  Including Hispanics and they go, oh, look at the, yeah, I need to water my arm. Let me hire a Mexican.
[03:13:31.900 --> 03:13:34.900]  That's a farmer that your granddaddy was.
[03:13:34.900 --> 03:13:41.900]  That's why they can fix a car, roof your house, do the plumbing, do the electricity, do all this stuff and cook you dinner all at the same time.
[03:13:41.900 --> 03:13:43.900]  Because they're what we used to be.
[03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:47.900]  Our farmers were just as good or better in many cases, no matter where you were in the world.
[03:13:47.900 --> 03:13:52.900]  We've been taken out of the real world, these domesticated slobs that do little specialized jobs.
[03:13:52.900 --> 03:13:57.900]  And then you call a handyman to come fix something and then make fun of them because they know how to fix something.
[03:13:57.900 --> 03:14:01.900]  And what they did was my dad was, oh my God, this is like in the 80s.
[03:14:01.900 --> 03:14:03.900]  He goes, you can now buy land in Mexico. It's incredible.
[03:14:03.900 --> 03:14:07.900]  So we all go down there to Yucatan. He goes, I checked into it. It's a UN thing.
[03:14:07.900 --> 03:14:10.900]  They took all these farmers land and now they're selling it off and it's all controlled.
[03:14:10.900 --> 03:14:12.900]  But you can build on it's all part of a big corporate fraud.
[03:14:12.900 --> 03:14:16.900]  I'm like, okay, whatever dad, let's go back to the hotel and you know, let's go scuba diving.
[03:14:16.900 --> 03:14:21.900]  But then now it's all come out that you go down to Cozumel or anywhere.
[03:14:21.900 --> 03:14:24.900]  And there used to be all those little fishermen that would even take you out fishing. They're all gone.
[03:14:24.900 --> 03:14:26.900]  They tell you. They tell you in Spanish.
[03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:29.900]  I've got a family that speaks Spanish and they say, Buckley and others have been down there with us.
[03:14:29.900 --> 03:14:31.900]  And they're like, no, they don't let us fish anymore.
[03:14:31.900 --> 03:14:35.900]  We have to work in the tourist industry and these big trawlers come by and get everything.
[03:14:35.900 --> 03:14:37.900]  The point is, this is the new world order.
[03:14:37.900 --> 03:14:41.900]  And then all these Mexicans have been kicked off their land.
[03:14:41.900 --> 03:14:46.900]  They're forced up the Macalodores and these slave factories and then they're pushed up here.
[03:14:46.900 --> 03:14:50.900]  The reason we're against them is they're being used as an economic weapon to bring us down to their level.
[03:14:50.900 --> 03:14:51.900]  That's right.
[03:14:51.900 --> 03:14:53.900]  We want them to get ahead. We're not out to get them.
[03:14:53.900 --> 03:14:58.900]  It's the point is the new world order that runs the Chinese slave factories is for this.
[03:14:58.900 --> 03:15:01.900]  And what you're talking about here in terms of putting out the small fishermen,
[03:15:01.900 --> 03:15:04.900]  we've already seen this happening as part of the Brexit debate.
[03:15:04.900 --> 03:15:08.900]  They were talking about the fact that English fishermen were not being allowed to fish in the North Sea
[03:15:08.900 --> 03:15:11.900]  as they had done for hundreds or thousands of years.
[03:15:11.900 --> 03:15:16.900]  They were being regulated out of this by the European Commission on which they didn't have a seat.
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:17.900]  They just pay off by the Japanese.
[03:15:17.900 --> 03:15:18.900]  Yeah, exactly. They didn't have a seat.
[03:15:18.900 --> 03:15:20.900]  And so we're seeing the same thing happening here.
[03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:22.900]  Nothing against the Japanese, but they know how to pay your politicians off,
[03:15:22.900 --> 03:15:24.900]  get the corporate deals and then trawl everything.
[03:15:24.900 --> 03:15:29.900]  And of course, it's a Japanese corporation that is looking at this massive imminent domain fraud
[03:15:29.900 --> 03:15:33.900]  that we've put out one report and we're about to do another report here in Texas.
[03:15:33.900 --> 03:15:39.900]  The Texas Central Rail Project that's going to do a high speed Japanese train running from Dallas to Houston.
[03:15:39.900 --> 03:15:42.900]  And Alex, this is the next level of this.
[03:15:42.900 --> 03:15:43.900]  They've gone in first.
[03:15:43.900 --> 03:15:46.900]  Well, the Japanese are just masters of their elites are screwing everybody.
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:48.900]  Yeah, but you look at imminent domain.
[03:15:48.900 --> 03:15:52.900]  First, they took it for public use and they went for private use.
[03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:53.900]  We had the Supreme Court decision about that.
[03:15:53.900 --> 03:15:56.900]  And there's the Japanese want to build a bullet train, pay for it.
[03:15:56.900 --> 03:16:00.900]  Yeah, then they went to foreign corporations allowing them to take your property for private use.
[03:16:00.900 --> 03:16:04.900]  And now in this particular project, they've got two different paths.
[03:16:04.900 --> 03:16:06.900]  They haven't even decided which path they're going to do,
[03:16:06.900 --> 03:16:11.900]  but they're going to go in and short stick it all, all the imminent domain procedures and take both paths,
[03:16:11.900 --> 03:16:13.900]  take property along both paths for this private corporation.
[03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:15.900]  It just keeps growing if you don't stop it.
[03:16:15.900 --> 03:16:17.900]  Well, I'm going to let you take over.
[03:16:17.900 --> 03:16:18.900]  You've done a fabulous job.
[03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:20.900]  I want to parallel a few quotes here.
[03:16:20.900 --> 03:16:23.900]  We'll skip this break and just move over here whenever you want.
[03:16:23.900 --> 03:16:26.900]  But I'm going to read a few quotes that dovetail just what's happening in the world.
[03:16:26.900 --> 03:16:27.900]  Some of my favorite quotes.
[03:16:27.900 --> 03:16:30.900]  I was likening in the first hour and I wanted to have this quote.
[03:16:30.900 --> 03:16:32.900]  I didn't have it in front of me.
[03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:35.900]  How the elite talk about us in white papers, how they see us,
[03:16:35.900 --> 03:16:39.900]  and then how they build society to make us the servile dumb-down idiots,
[03:16:39.900 --> 03:16:42.900]  the Eloi that they call us, which is another H.G. Wells book.
[03:16:42.900 --> 03:16:45.900]  But this is from War of the Worlds, 1898.
[03:16:45.900 --> 03:16:50.900]  He wrote books in 1898 about atomic bombs before Max Planck's equations.
[03:16:50.900 --> 03:16:52.900]  Because let me tell you, they roll this out a little bit later.
[03:16:52.900 --> 03:16:55.900]  Kind of like they announced they're going to do human animal cloning this week.
[03:16:55.900 --> 03:16:58.900]  Going on for 30 years, folks.
[03:16:58.900 --> 03:17:01.900]  I mean, I've got their formula down.
[03:17:01.900 --> 03:17:04.900]  Here's the opening paragraph of H.G. Wells, the War of the Worlds.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:08.900]  No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century
[03:17:08.900 --> 03:17:13.900]  that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's
[03:17:13.900 --> 03:17:15.900]  and yet as mortal as his own.
[03:17:15.900 --> 03:17:19.900]  That his man busied themselves about their various concerns.
[03:17:19.900 --> 03:17:24.900]  They were scrutinized and studied by the Facebooks, the Googles, the Twitters,
[03:17:24.900 --> 03:17:26.900]  the Spigots in your house.
[03:17:26.900 --> 03:17:33.900]  Perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures
[03:17:33.900 --> 03:17:36.900]  that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
[03:17:36.900 --> 03:17:44.900]  With infinite complacency, men went to and fro over this globe and about their little affairs,
[03:17:44.900 --> 03:17:49.900]  serene in their assurance of their empire over matter.
[03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:54.900]  It is possible that the insofar as under the microscope do the same.
[03:17:54.900 --> 03:18:02.900]  No one gave a thought to the other worlds of space as sources of human danger
[03:18:02.900 --> 03:18:09.900]  or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon an impossible or improbable.
[03:18:09.900 --> 03:18:15.900]  It is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days.
[03:18:15.900 --> 03:18:22.900]  As most terrestrial men fancied, there might be other men upon Mars perhaps inferior to themselves
[03:18:22.900 --> 03:18:29.900]  and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise yet across the gulf of space in the minds of the psychopaths.
[03:18:29.900 --> 03:18:35.900]  By the way, he wrote this was allegory about the elite, yet across the gulfs of space.
[03:18:35.900 --> 03:18:36.900]  That's a key.
[03:18:36.900 --> 03:18:43.900]  Minds that are to our own minds as ours are to those of the beast of the parish.
[03:18:43.900 --> 03:18:52.900]  Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded this earth with envious eyes
[03:18:52.900 --> 03:18:57.900]  and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
[03:18:57.900 --> 03:19:03.900]  And early in the 20th century came the great disillusionment.
[03:19:03.900 --> 03:19:07.900]  Now he wrote more than 20 books that were nonfiction and wrote in one of them.
[03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:12.900]  You can look it up that this was an allegory of the elite socialist and the social Darwinist against us.
[03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:13.900]  They are the new man.
[03:19:13.900 --> 03:19:17.900]  They are the cold calculating.
[03:19:17.900 --> 03:19:20.900]  I think, oh, I can understand you want to love everyone.
[03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:25.900]  We're going to kill everybody to build a utopia upon it because, again,
[03:19:25.900 --> 03:19:29.900]  that to our minds are as those of the beast of the parish.
[03:19:29.900 --> 03:19:35.900]  Intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic like a little kid they've grabbed out of your backyard.
[03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:39.900]  This psycho coldly lays it out and straps it down for torture and rape.
[03:19:39.900 --> 03:19:45.900]  Regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us.
[03:19:45.900 --> 03:19:49.900]  You know what I see in that, Alex, is an echo of the art like war.
[03:19:49.900 --> 03:19:51.900]  You know, you've seen Elysium, these other things.
[03:19:51.900 --> 03:19:53.900]  They said they're going to go out near Earth orbit.
[03:19:53.900 --> 03:19:54.900]  We've got Jeff Bezos.
[03:19:54.900 --> 03:19:56.900]  That's the sort of thing that he's been doing about.
[03:19:56.900 --> 03:19:57.900]  Oh, they're telling us your plan.
[03:19:57.900 --> 03:19:58.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:19:58.900 --> 03:19:59.900]  And they look at this.
[03:19:59.900 --> 03:20:01.900]  They're going to invite us up there.
[03:20:01.900 --> 03:20:02.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:02.900 --> 03:20:05.900]  All the high technology, all the super drugs, everything.
[03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:08.900]  If we'll just sell everybody else out, that's the ticket.
[03:20:08.900 --> 03:20:09.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:09.900 --> 03:20:10.900]  You know what I'm going to say?
[03:20:10.900 --> 03:20:11.900]  Go ahead.
[03:20:11.900 --> 03:20:13.900]  They call themselves the Cosmis.
[03:20:13.900 --> 03:20:16.900]  And in that passage right there, they're talking about the Terrans.
[03:20:16.900 --> 03:20:20.900]  The higher life forms, the artificial intelligence.
[03:20:20.900 --> 03:20:22.900]  So you know when Hugo DeGaris started talking about that.
[03:20:22.900 --> 03:20:23.900]  You're right.
[03:20:23.900 --> 03:20:24.900]  It's the allegory of Olympus versus the commoners.
[03:20:24.900 --> 03:20:25.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:25.900 --> 03:20:26.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:26.900 --> 03:20:27.900]  Or their artificial intelligence.
[03:20:27.900 --> 03:20:28.900]  They think that they're crazy.
[03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:30.900]  But before they become gods, they must go to the golden field of Elysium.
[03:20:30.900 --> 03:20:31.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:31.900 --> 03:20:32.900]  That's the purgatory.
[03:20:32.900 --> 03:20:33.900]  Go ahead.
[03:20:33.900 --> 03:20:34.900]  Exactly.
[03:20:34.900 --> 03:20:35.900]  That's what they're looking at.
[03:20:35.900 --> 03:20:39.900]  That they understand. And the thing that Hugo DeGaris understands, we started talking about
[03:20:39.900 --> 03:20:42.900]  the Artilect War, the War of Artificial Intelligence.
[03:20:42.900 --> 03:20:45.900]  We had the elites go into near Earth orbit.
[03:20:45.900 --> 03:20:46.900]  Well, that's 2001.
[03:20:46.900 --> 03:20:49.900]  We must defeat that first to transcend.
[03:20:49.900 --> 03:20:50.900]  Yeah.
[03:20:50.900 --> 03:20:52.900]  Well, of course, what they're planning, Alex, is gigadeath.
[03:20:52.900 --> 03:20:54.900]  Not megadeath, but gigadeath.
[03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:55.900]  Okay.
[03:20:55.900 --> 03:20:56.900]  That's what they're looking at.
[03:20:56.900 --> 03:20:57.900]  Billions of people killed.
[03:20:57.900 --> 03:20:59.900]  And they do it from their remote redoubt.
[03:20:59.900 --> 03:21:00.900]  They're already planning it all.
[03:21:00.900 --> 03:21:01.900]  Exactly.
[03:21:01.900 --> 03:21:02.900]  Exactly.
[03:21:02.900 --> 03:21:06.900]  You know, what's interesting is that the people who sit there, the people that sit in the
[03:21:06.900 --> 03:21:10.900]  front of us, when you and your family are not going to the command base, I mean, very
[03:21:10.900 --> 03:21:13.900]  few people have been given offers to join the actual elite.
[03:21:13.900 --> 03:21:18.900]  And I just sit here as someone who has been offered this because they're smart folks.
[03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:19.900]  They can long-term see where I was going.
[03:21:19.900 --> 03:21:22.900]  They sit there and they literally, all these idiots serve it.
[03:21:22.900 --> 03:21:25.900]  You will never be brought up to those people.
[03:21:25.900 --> 03:21:30.900]  In fact, they see the minions that open the gate, the traders as the most horrible, profane
[03:21:30.900 --> 03:21:31.900]  people.
[03:21:31.900 --> 03:21:36.380]  doesn't know. The elite see themselves as pure. They see the traitors as the scum of
[03:21:36.380 --> 03:21:40.860]  the earth. They see us as the white knights. But in their weird Luciferian religion, they
[03:21:40.860 --> 03:21:44.460]  think they're one level above us and are willing to do the bad things. We're H.G. Wells
[03:21:44.460 --> 03:21:49.100]  wrote and others did. And Lord Rothschild, we're so sorry we do this. We know it's horrible,
[03:21:49.100 --> 03:21:52.100]  but it's for the greater good our master told us.
[03:21:52.100 --> 03:21:53.100]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:54.600]  These are the deep secrets.
[03:21:54.600 --> 03:21:55.600]  Yeah.
[03:21:55.600 --> 03:21:56.600]  Yeah.
[03:21:56.600 --> 03:21:57.600]  So where do you see all this going, David?
[03:21:57.600 --> 03:22:03.380]  Well, Alex, I think the key is, will people wake up? And I don't think we've got a lot
[03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:06.600]  of time because they're going to shut down our transportation. They're going to
[03:22:06.600 --> 03:22:07.600]  They're moving in the final grid.
[03:22:07.600 --> 03:22:10.820]  Drugs was right. When drugs was here a year ago, I'm like, really shut it down next year
[03:22:10.820 --> 03:22:11.820]  and it's like it's all happening.
[03:22:11.820 --> 03:22:15.780]  Yeah. Yeah. They're going to do it very quickly. I mean, you've got an article at the top of
[03:22:15.780 --> 03:22:20.180]  dredge today talking about how they're going to make it illegal to drive and drink coffee.
[03:22:20.180 --> 03:22:24.500]  That's not targeted towards coffee drinking. That doesn't make you a more dangerous driver.
[03:22:24.500 --> 03:22:25.500]  That's what you go after everybody.
[03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:28.700]  Yeah. They're trying to shut down driving. They don't want you driving.
[03:22:28.700 --> 03:22:30.700]  They want computers to control your transportation.
[03:22:30.700 --> 03:22:34.140]  Exactly. They're going to make it incomparable. And that's not the cops. Sure, there's bad
[03:22:34.140 --> 03:22:35.140]  cops through them.
[03:22:35.140 --> 03:22:38.500]  The point is, they're not who you blame, like TSA being out of control.
[03:22:38.500 --> 03:22:39.500]  No, no, no.
[03:22:39.500 --> 03:22:40.500]  You blame the Congress that did it.
[03:22:40.500 --> 03:22:41.500]  The Alliance.
[03:22:41.500 --> 03:22:45.300]  All I'm saying is with the cops, the target is not the cop at the gas pump to pump full
[03:22:45.300 --> 03:22:47.780]  of lead. The target is the globalists.
[03:22:47.780 --> 03:22:53.700]  Yeah. That's right. The Alliance is with the globalists like Elon Musk, who gets $5 billion
[03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:59.380]  of government subsidies as well as exclusives on certain things. And look at what happened
[03:22:59.380 --> 03:23:00.380]  at the DNC.
[03:23:00.380 --> 03:23:04.300]  We've got Uber. If you want to get in the DNC, you could either, if you're not a VIP,
[03:23:04.300 --> 03:23:08.100]  you could either hoof it for several miles through the heat or you could get Uber to
[03:23:08.100 --> 03:23:09.100]  take you right.
[03:23:09.100 --> 03:23:10.100]  Which is run by Ron Ayls, brother.
[03:23:10.100 --> 03:23:13.460]  Exactly. And so what they're doing is that that's the way, that's the metaphor for the
[03:23:13.460 --> 03:23:15.460]  way they're going to operate in the economy.
[03:23:15.460 --> 03:23:18.380]  This is a new technocracy where they just block out whatever they want. Let me read two
[03:23:18.380 --> 03:23:20.220]  more quotes and I'm going to punch out and let you take over.
[03:23:20.220 --> 03:23:23.020]  A Tale of Two Cities. I think there's so many quotes I want to read. I read this all the
[03:23:23.020 --> 03:23:26.140]  time and it's just great because it says everything.
[03:23:26.140 --> 03:23:32.100]  It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of wisdom. It was
[03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:37.900]  the age of foolishness. It was the epoch of belief. It was the epoch of incredulity. It
[03:23:37.900 --> 03:23:41.940]  was the season of light. It was the season of darkness. It was the spring of hope. It
[03:23:41.940 --> 03:23:47.380]  was the winter of despair. We had everything before us. We had nothing before us. We were
[03:23:47.380 --> 03:23:53.220]  all going direct to heaven. We were all going direct the other way. In short, the period
[03:23:53.220 --> 03:23:59.100]  was so far like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on it
[03:23:59.100 --> 03:24:08.980]  being received for good or evil in the superlative degree of comparison only. Don't get literature
[03:24:08.980 --> 03:24:11.740]  like that from Charles Dickens, do you?
[03:24:11.740 --> 03:24:12.740]  No.
[03:24:12.740 --> 03:24:18.900]  You're going to have robots writing stuff like that. Now, let's go on to the next piece
[03:24:18.900 --> 03:24:23.180]  here. The truth is this whole attack is just to stimulate us to the next level. God did
[03:24:23.180 --> 03:24:27.740]  all this and I totally see the plan. Let's go ahead and go to the next piece here. Marcus
[03:24:27.740 --> 03:24:34.100]  Terrilli is Cicero. A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious. Let's start
[03:24:34.100 --> 03:24:35.100]  on the front.
[03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:41.220]  But it cannot survive treason from within. That evil will to attack productivity. I'm
[03:24:41.220 --> 03:24:46.220]  sorry I'm adding things. A nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious. But it cannot
[03:24:46.220 --> 03:24:50.700]  survive treason from within.
[03:24:50.700 --> 03:24:56.220]  An enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and carries his banner openly.
[03:24:56.220 --> 03:25:02.300]  But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely. His sly whispers rustling
[03:25:02.300 --> 03:25:07.100]  through all the alleyways, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor
[03:25:07.100 --> 03:25:12.740]  appears not a traitor. He speaks in accents familiar to his victims and he wears the face
[03:25:12.740 --> 03:25:18.340]  and their arguments. He appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He
[03:25:18.340 --> 03:25:24.660]  rots the soul of a nation. He works secretly and unknown the night to undermine the pillars
[03:25:24.660 --> 03:25:31.300]  of the city. He infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer
[03:25:31.300 --> 03:25:36.940]  is less to fear. The traitor is the plague.
[03:25:36.940 --> 03:25:37.940]  Yeah.
[03:25:37.940 --> 03:25:41.780]  I'm going to let you take over. Great job, David. Not only news tonight. 7 o'clock central.
[03:25:41.780 --> 03:25:44.420]  In five minutes you can move over. Obviously we're going to break. But thank you, David.
[03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:45.420]  Please continue.
[03:25:45.420 --> 03:25:48.780]  We know Alex when you're reading that story that comes to mind is the one that broke this
[03:25:48.780 --> 03:25:53.700]  weekend about National Review saying that Obama violated the law with his ransom payments.
[03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:54.700]  Okay.
[03:25:54.700 --> 03:25:58.780]  We've had a lot of ways. Again, just as we saw with the Bill Mauer story, they spend
[03:25:58.780 --> 03:26:03.240]  the information in particular ways. And what did they do when it was revealed by Wall Street
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:10.040]  Journal last Wednesday that they had put pallets of foreign currency from Swiss banks and
[03:26:10.040 --> 03:26:11.820]  phoned them secretly to Iran?
[03:26:11.820 --> 03:26:12.820]  Without congressional authorization.
[03:26:12.820 --> 03:26:13.820]  Exactly.
[03:26:13.820 --> 03:26:14.820]  It is illegal.
[03:26:14.820 --> 03:26:17.860]  Well, what they first did was they focused on Donald Trump saying, you can see the plane
[03:26:17.860 --> 03:26:21.740]  when he's talking about B-roll that's there, right? Whether he saw the plane or not. They
[03:26:21.740 --> 03:26:25.820]  focus on that. Then the next thing they come out and they say, well, it's not a ransom.
[03:26:25.820 --> 03:26:29.980]  This was all planned. We've been talking about giving them this money back for 37 years,
[03:26:29.980 --> 03:26:35.140]  but it just happened to be the right timing to do it as we got these hostages released.
[03:26:35.140 --> 03:26:39.180]  That story begins to break down. People obviously know that this is a ransom that was paid.
[03:26:39.180 --> 03:26:43.900]  One of the hostages there, a pastor, that everybody had criticized when the deal was
[03:26:43.900 --> 03:26:49.740]  struck back in July. They said, you couldn't even secure the release of four high-profile
[03:26:49.740 --> 03:26:54.140]  hostages that were held in Iran unreasonably. Again, this guy was arrested simply for being
[03:26:54.140 --> 03:26:55.140]  a Christian.
[03:26:55.140 --> 03:26:58.660]  They said, you couldn't even negotiate that when you turned over so much stuff to Iran.
[03:26:58.660 --> 03:27:03.300]  So then six months later, they did get the release of these people by giving them $400
[03:27:03.300 --> 03:27:06.740]  million. But National Review pointed out this week in Alex, and this was something that's
[03:27:06.740 --> 03:27:12.500]  picked up by Drudge, that it's about the violation of the law. What we've got going on here.
[03:27:12.500 --> 03:27:14.380]  Just like other borders. Exactly.
[03:27:14.380 --> 03:27:15.740]  This is what the hell he wants.
[03:27:15.740 --> 03:27:22.740]  Well, I mean, this is like Mina Arkansas MO that we've got going on here. He said at
[03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:26.420]  the time that he did, he said, well, I just couldn't write them a check. Well, there's
[03:27:26.420 --> 03:27:28.140]  a reason he can't write them a check.
[03:27:28.140 --> 03:27:29.140]  It's gotta prove.
[03:27:29.140 --> 03:27:34.700]  Well, there's all kinds of prohibitions in terms of sanctions and other things that make
[03:27:34.700 --> 03:27:40.340]  it illegal to have any financial dealings with Iran. And that includes using a third
[03:27:40.340 --> 03:27:45.900]  party go-between that is explicitly prohibited. So they go through and they lay out all the
[03:27:45.900 --> 03:27:50.260]  different things that he did in this. And the bottom line, Alex, is that there is a
[03:27:50.260 --> 03:27:56.860]  section of the law, 560.701, makes it clear, willful violations of these regulations constitute
[03:27:56.860 --> 03:28:02.940]  a serious felony offense under federal criminal law, 20 years imprisonment.
[03:28:02.940 --> 03:28:06.620]  Just like shipping and illegal across is a felony. I mean, they complete the smuggling
[03:28:06.620 --> 03:28:10.900]  problem. And again, if you're going to ship them in, at least give them a TB test and
[03:28:10.900 --> 03:28:12.180]  then give them treatment.
[03:28:12.180 --> 03:28:13.180]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:28:13.180 --> 03:28:17.700]  But look at the money laundering. We're told in the war on cash that if you tried to get
[03:28:17.700 --> 03:28:22.940]  cash out of the bank, okay, it's a crime. This guy, they just took out the Republican
[03:28:22.940 --> 03:28:29.860]  they took out. They couldn't get him on, what was his name, a former Speaker of the House.
[03:28:29.860 --> 03:28:31.500]  He'd been there the longest time, Hastert.
[03:28:31.500 --> 03:28:32.500]  Yeah.
[03:28:32.500 --> 03:28:36.340]  Okay. He was a known pedophile, but statute of limitations. Unfortunately, we have a statute
[03:28:36.340 --> 03:28:40.260]  of limitations on pedophiles. We shouldn't have one, but it had run out. So what did
[03:28:40.260 --> 03:28:45.660]  they do? They came after him for withdrawing his own money to pay off a blackmailer. Okay.
[03:28:45.660 --> 03:28:49.700]  So they look at the money that you put in and they report it to the federal government.
[03:28:49.700 --> 03:28:53.780]  The money you take out, if it's cash, they report that to the federal government. Small
[03:28:53.780 --> 03:29:01.140]  amounts, $10,000 or more relative to this. This is $400 million. It's 40,000 times what
[03:29:01.140 --> 03:29:06.500]  they report on all the rest of us. Okay. And we look at this, we look at this massive money
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:12.980]  laundering conspiracy that is a federal crime punishable by 20 years. And of course, nobody's
[03:29:12.980 --> 03:29:18.380]  going to do anything with it, Alex, because they no longer care about our government
[03:29:18.380 --> 03:29:22.020]  violating these laws. When I was talking about Bill Mauer earlier, one of the things that
[03:29:22.020 --> 03:29:25.220]  he said to Julian Assange and said, you're putting your thumb on the scale for the only
[03:29:25.220 --> 03:29:28.500]  person that can keep us from being ruled by Donald Trump.
[03:29:28.500 --> 03:29:29.500]  Yeah.
[03:29:29.500 --> 03:29:32.300]  We're actually trying to elect Donald Trump. Yeah. That's the way they think, though. And
[03:29:32.300 --> 03:29:36.500]  the Democrats are all ruling. They think that the president is a dictator and they're
[03:29:36.500 --> 03:29:39.700]  again, they're again, day to night, taking our wrap at the break. I'm Alex Jones, free

[03:29:55.940 --> 03:30:03.500]  Video from Donald Trump's speech in Daytona Beach last week shows ABC news cutting the
[03:30:03.500 --> 03:30:07.500]  live feed as Trump begins to talk about Hillary Clinton's connections to ISIS as reported
[03:30:07.500 --> 03:30:12.500]  by Paul Joseph Watson of info wars.com. Before the feed was cut, Trump said, quote, take a
[03:30:12.500 --> 03:30:16.300]  look at Lando. Take a look at San Bernardino. Take a look at the World Trade Center and
[03:30:16.300 --> 03:30:20.740]  we let ISIS take this position. It was Hillary Clinton that she should get an award from them
[03:30:20.740 --> 03:30:25.420]  as the founder of ISIS. And right after Trump made that statement, ABC news cut the feed
[03:30:25.420 --> 03:30:29.500]  and went to background music. ABC isn't the only network to cut the feed with someone's
[03:30:29.500 --> 03:30:33.660]  critical of Hillary. Last month, for example, CNN cut its own feed when a reporter pointed
[03:30:33.660 --> 03:30:37.980]  out that Hillary's support for anti crime legislation in the nineties led to the mass
[03:30:37.980 --> 03:30:42.940]  incarceration of African Americans. And Hillary supported the hottest in the Middle East, particularly
[03:30:42.940 --> 03:30:47.420]  in Libya and Syria while serving as Secretary of State, has directly led to the deaths of
[03:30:47.420 --> 03:30:51.140]  hundreds of thousands of Muslims. The fact the mainstream media keeps downplaying while
[03:30:51.140 --> 03:30:56.540]  claiming Trump is, quote, Islamophobic. And to find out more, visit info wars.com. This
[03:30:56.540 --> 03:30:58.380]  is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:30:58.380 --> 03:31:04.020]  More than two years ago, info wars first told you about our research into what has been
[03:31:04.020 --> 03:31:08.540]  called the iodine conspiracy. I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[03:31:08.540 --> 03:31:13.500]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[03:31:13.500 --> 03:31:18.380]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family into
[03:31:18.380 --> 03:31:23.540]  the water. They took the good halogen and put the deadly halogen in. And when the Fukushima
[03:31:23.540 --> 03:31:28.180]  crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare
[03:31:28.180 --> 03:31:34.260]  yourself and your family. Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning
[03:31:34.260 --> 03:31:39.220]  the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be
[03:31:39.220 --> 03:31:44.540]  the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine. You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:31:44.540 --> 03:31:48.820]  This is the real deal, folks. And the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to

[03:32:15.620 --> 03:32:19.860]  heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is
[03:32:19.860 --> 03:32:23.420]  dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with

[03:33:21.020 --> 03:33:26.340]  And of course, tomorrow is the day that people in Wisconsin can declare their independence
[03:33:26.340 --> 03:33:31.820]  from the globalists. And of course, we had Paul Nalen earlier on the show with Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.820 --> 03:33:35.660]  Very important interview. You know, when I was listening to it, I had not heard him speak.
[03:33:35.660 --> 03:33:39.900]  I've read a lot of what he's written, and I agreed with his positions on the issues.
[03:33:39.900 --> 03:33:44.980]  But the guy is really articulate. He's well-informed. He's totally awake. I certainly hope that
[03:33:44.980 --> 03:33:50.140]  this is going to be an election that sends a message to the globalists, to Washington.
[03:33:50.140 --> 03:33:54.580]  We're going to talk about Paul Rhino. And let's talk about that first, you know, because
[03:33:54.580 --> 03:34:00.260]  we've got several different articles here about Paul Ryan. People who are in Wisconsin
[03:34:00.260 --> 03:34:04.380]  need to understand. And if you're there, make sure that your neighbors understand this is
[03:34:04.380 --> 03:34:10.980]  an open primary. If you are a Democrat, if you are an independent, you can still send
[03:34:10.980 --> 03:34:14.780]  a message to the globalists. You can throw out Paul Ryan. He isn't somebody that we
[03:34:14.780 --> 03:34:21.380]  need, okay? Republicans and Democrats alike should be fed up with this guy. He has lied
[03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:25.900]  to his Republican constituents. He has told them repeatedly that he's going to do one
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:32.260]  thing and then do something completely different. That's been the way that he has run his political
[03:34:32.260 --> 03:34:37.900]  career from the very beginning. But a lot of people who watched him up close knew exactly
[03:34:37.900 --> 03:34:39.300]  who this guy was.
[03:34:39.300 --> 03:34:45.220]  Paul Ryan does not want to even mention the name of his opponent, Paul Nalen. He doesn't
[03:34:45.220 --> 03:34:49.580]  want to debate him. He doesn't run any commercials against him. You know, when Eric Cantor did
[03:34:49.580 --> 03:34:54.640]  that, he lost. He was the number two guy in the Republican House and he lost his seat
[03:34:54.640 --> 03:34:59.500]  against the challenger for the same reasons because he had been somebody who had been
[03:34:59.500 --> 03:35:03.700]  with a Democrat. You know, we see all these articles coming up all the time about this
[03:35:03.700 --> 03:35:07.540]  low level function area. This guy who was assistant to the assistant to the assistant
[03:35:07.540 --> 03:35:13.420]  of Jeb Bush's campaign is now going to support Hillary Clinton. We knew that, okay? We knew
[03:35:13.420 --> 03:35:17.900]  the guys at the top of the Republican Party were indistinguishable from the people at
[03:35:17.900 --> 03:35:22.580]  the top of the Democrat Party. We understood that. We know there is one party. It's the
[03:35:22.580 --> 03:35:28.060]  Globalist Bankers Party, okay? And they've been having a big party at our expense. So
[03:35:28.060 --> 03:35:32.820]  we knew that. That isn't anything new. And yet we see all the mainstream media. We see
[03:35:32.820 --> 03:35:39.740]  the AP Reuters every time somebody who has even the most tangential connection to the
[03:35:39.740 --> 03:35:45.780]  Republican Party says that they're going to get a GOP dog catcher in some rural area
[03:35:45.780 --> 03:35:49.860]  says, I'm going to vote for Hillary instead of Donald Trump. It's a top story at the hill
[03:35:49.860 --> 03:35:55.420]  at Politico. Reuters, okay? They all put this up. The Wall Street Journal and the whole
[03:35:55.420 --> 03:35:59.260]  mainstream media will focus on that. But when you've got somebody who comes out like
[03:35:59.260 --> 03:36:05.220]  Tom Tancredo, somebody who himself who is run for president, a brief campaign, but he's
[03:36:05.220 --> 03:36:11.420]  a long-term congressman and he has taken the trip to Wisconsin to tell people about Paul
[03:36:11.420 --> 03:36:17.220]  Rhino. And he says, Paul Ryan has enabled illegal immigration since the day he walked
[03:36:17.220 --> 03:36:21.420]  into Congress. That's a headline on Breitbart. He says, I've known Paul Ryan since the day
[03:36:21.420 --> 03:36:27.140]  he walked into Congress and I assure you he has never, ever, ever been supported of any
[03:36:27.140 --> 03:36:31.340]  of the attempts that have been made to secure our borders or to do anything substantial
[03:36:31.340 --> 03:36:35.940]  about the issue of illegal immigration into the country. And as I said last week, Paul
[03:36:35.940 --> 03:36:40.620]  Ryan doesn't want people to know that there's somebody running against him. He doesn't want
[03:36:40.620 --> 03:36:46.660]  to show that difference because more than it revealing that he's got an opponent and
[03:36:46.660 --> 03:36:52.580]  telling people who his opponent is, if he starts to run ads against his opponent, it's
[03:36:52.580 --> 03:36:58.820]  going to highlight the fact that Paul Ryan is against the Republican constituents and
[03:36:58.820 --> 03:37:02.860]  he's with the globalists and he's with the Chamber of Commerce. This is what Tancredo
[03:37:02.860 --> 03:37:07.540]  went on to say. He said, tell your constituents who you are. See, Paul Ryan doesn't even want
[03:37:07.540 --> 03:37:11.180]  to, he doesn't want to tell people who Paul Nailin is. He doesn't want people to know
[03:37:11.180 --> 03:37:14.060]  who he is and that's the key.
[03:37:14.060 --> 03:37:21.020]  If you know who Paul Ryan is, Republicans, Democrats and independents will reject this
[03:37:21.020 --> 03:37:25.260]  elitist globalist who works for the bankers. He says, stand up in front of your constituents,
[03:37:25.260 --> 03:37:29.420]  Tancredo said to Paul Ryan. Stand up in front of your constituents and say, look, I'm an
[03:37:29.420 --> 03:37:33.580]  open borders guy. The Chamber of Commerce believes in it. The Chamber of Commerce wants
[03:37:33.580 --> 03:37:39.340]  cheap labor and I do what the Chamber of Commerce wants. I always have, I'm an establishment
[03:37:39.340 --> 03:37:44.700]  guy. He said, tell them who you are. Be responsible. Be respectable to them. Don't lie to them
[03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:49.300]  anymore. Okay? He said, tell voters I'm for the TPP. Even though, yeah, most of my constituents
[03:37:49.300 --> 03:37:54.100]  are going to get hurt by it, but the Chamber of Commerce wants that. So stand up, Paul.
[03:37:54.100 --> 03:37:59.340]  Tell them the truth. Paul Rhino, okay? Informed reporters, they came to Wisconsin in order
[03:37:59.340 --> 03:38:07.220]  to throw the BS flag on Ryan's recent campaign that tried to misrepresent his record on immigration.
[03:38:07.220 --> 03:38:10.700]  So that's where we are. It's coming up tomorrow. And of course, when we look at what's going
[03:38:10.700 --> 03:38:14.460]  on with immigration, there was a story via the Drudge Report. It was a daily caller talking
[03:38:14.460 --> 03:38:20.540]  about how in Virginia, they're bringing in, of course, Kerry wanted to have this goal.
[03:38:20.540 --> 03:38:27.140]  He was bragging the last day of Ramadan to some Muslims that he was dining with on Ramadan.
[03:38:27.140 --> 03:38:32.060]  He said, we're going to bring in six times the number of people that we did last year
[03:38:32.060 --> 03:38:36.940]  from Syria. Okay? And they're bringing them in. They're bringing some of them into Virginia.
[03:38:36.940 --> 03:38:40.660]  But guess where they're putting them? They're not putting them in their backyard. Okay? They're
[03:38:40.660 --> 03:38:45.020]  not putting them in the Washington, D.C. area. No, no, no, no, no. They're going to stick
[03:38:45.020 --> 03:38:53.100]  91% of them out in the rural areas, the places where there's low income, the places where
[03:38:53.100 --> 03:38:57.780]  there's already higher poverty rates and no jobs, and the places where they have lower
[03:38:57.780 --> 03:39:03.700]  populations because folks, let's understand what's going on here. This is, as the German
[03:39:03.700 --> 03:39:11.020]  writer I pointed out last week said about Angela Merkel, this is the great people replacement.
[03:39:11.020 --> 03:39:15.020]  They want to replace the indigenous people in this country. And that's whether you are
[03:39:15.020 --> 03:39:20.020]  black, white, Hispanic or whatever. If you're an American who's been here, if you buy into
[03:39:20.020 --> 03:39:25.820]  the American ideals, they want to replace you with fresh new people that are open slate
[03:39:25.820 --> 03:39:32.500]  that they can make their voters. It was interesting when we're talking about Angela Merkel and
[03:39:32.500 --> 03:39:36.660]  the pushback against her. There was an interesting quote that I'd never seen before. Alex was
[03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:41.860]  reading a lot of quotes in the last segment about what the elites have been up to. It
[03:39:41.860 --> 03:39:48.100]  was in 1953, Bert Holt Brecht was a communist. And occasionally, communists say some really
[03:39:48.100 --> 03:39:54.020]  amazing things. Like when they say, power comes out of the barrel of a gun, and I'm
[03:39:54.020 --> 03:39:58.660]  going to control the guns, okay? Bert Holt Brecht was looking at what happened in Eastern
[03:39:58.660 --> 03:40:03.020]  Germany in 1953. Of course, I was the only one who had the iron curtain for those millennials
[03:40:03.020 --> 03:40:06.980]  who haven't, who've gone to public school. There was something called the iron curtain
[03:40:06.980 --> 03:40:12.420]  where they split Germany down the middle. And on the communist side, on the East German
[03:40:12.420 --> 03:40:19.340]  side, it was supposed to be a workers' paradise. And yet, guess what? They wanted a higher
[03:40:19.340 --> 03:40:25.220]  minimum wage. Does that sound familiar? That was the key thing. They had a massive demonstration
[03:40:25.220 --> 03:40:31.100]  saying they wanted higher minimum wages from their communist masters, because they always
[03:40:31.100 --> 03:40:36.420]  make themselves elitists, don't they? When communism happens, it isn't from each according
[03:40:36.420 --> 03:40:41.900]  to his ability to each according to his need. That doesn't work that way. You have a few
[03:40:41.900 --> 03:40:46.820]  elitists that get in charge and they get everything, just as we see with Kim Jong-un and the others.
[03:40:46.820 --> 03:40:51.620]  Well, what was happening in Eastern Germany that had a massive demonstration, wanting
[03:40:51.620 --> 03:40:58.340]  higher wages. They brutally repressed that, a lot of militarized brutality against those
[03:40:58.340 --> 03:41:03.100]  demonstrators. So, Bert Holt Breck became momentarily dissolutioned with communism and
[03:41:03.100 --> 03:41:08.420]  its practical application. And he said, well, you know, we'd like to, many people want to
[03:41:08.420 --> 03:41:12.700]  dissolve the government when it doesn't suit the people. But the government has decided
[03:41:12.700 --> 03:41:19.860]  that it's easier to dissolve the people and to elect another. That's what's happening
[03:41:19.860 --> 03:41:25.940]  right now. See, the Republicans and the Democrats have decided that you're not going to mess
[03:41:25.940 --> 03:41:29.140]  with them in Congress. For the most part, they're going to do whatever they can to rig
[03:41:29.140 --> 03:41:35.900]  the election. They're going to get big bucks from their patrons to do whatever they want.
[03:41:35.900 --> 03:41:40.540]  And they think that it is easier, and this is going to be a referendum tomorrow to see,
[03:41:40.540 --> 03:41:44.820]  which is going to be easier. Is it going to be easier for us to dissolve this Congress
[03:41:44.820 --> 03:41:51.580]  that has been taken over by the elites that works against our interests? Or is this Congress
[03:41:51.580 --> 03:41:57.500]  going to dissolve the people with open borders? Are they going to replace us with people who
[03:41:57.500 --> 03:42:04.500]  will do as they are told? That truly, folks, is a referendum that faces us.
[03:42:04.500 --> 03:42:08.900]  One last thing before we move on, and we're talking about these open borders. Again, as
[03:42:08.900 --> 03:42:15.780]  they pick their narrative, and this back and forth with Kaseer Khan, the Mr. Sharia Khan,
[03:42:15.780 --> 03:42:21.020]  as I call him, all the commentaries that we've seen about this, it just struck me as I was
[03:42:21.020 --> 03:42:25.900]  thinking about this. You know, he was interviewed even by Anderson Cooper. And if you go back
[03:42:25.900 --> 03:42:30.740]  a couple of months, just go back to June, okay, two months ago. What was happening then?
[03:42:30.740 --> 03:42:34.820]  Well, there was a shooting in Orlando, and you had Anderson Cooper coming after the Florida
[03:42:34.820 --> 03:42:40.340]  Attorney General, and her wranging her because she had opposed homosexual marriage, essentially
[03:42:40.340 --> 03:42:44.500]  trying to blame her for the shooting there, not the Muslims, okay? And one of the things
[03:42:44.500 --> 03:42:50.620]  that he said to her was, he said, you've never even tweeted about Gay Pride Month. See, that's
[03:42:50.620 --> 03:42:55.100]  evidence of somebody who hates homosexuals. If you don't tweet about Gay Pride Month in
[03:42:55.100 --> 03:43:00.340]  a positive way, then you are responsible for their murders. And yet, did you see him get
[03:43:00.340 --> 03:43:06.100]  tough when he interviewed Kaseer Khan? Did he say anything about his supporting Sharia
[03:43:06.100 --> 03:43:14.300]  Law? How he has written extensive commentaries about Sharia Law? How he has put out literature
[03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:20.220]  that's been done by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood? This is Sharia Law that has a
[03:43:20.220 --> 03:43:26.660]  death penalty for homosexuals, okay? And yet, you'll see that Anderson Cooper and the rest
[03:43:26.660 --> 03:43:33.140]  of the mainstream media gives him a pass on it when they come after somebody who has opposed
[03:43:33.140 --> 03:43:37.620]  homosexual marriage saying, you didn't tweet about Gay Pride, so you're responsible for
[03:43:37.620 --> 03:43:42.620]  this. That's what we see. That's the kind of double standard just as we saw with Bill
[03:43:42.620 --> 03:43:48.340]  Maurer. And I was talking about that with Alex Jones. It's absolutely amazing to me
[03:43:48.340 --> 03:43:54.780]  that Bill Maurer would go on, and I, quite frankly, I have a lot more confidence in Julian
[03:43:54.780 --> 03:43:59.260]  Assange. I believe that if he says that they've got a million-dollar contribution to a Hillary
[03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:04.220]  Clinton organization that they saw in their records, and he confronted him with that,
[03:44:04.220 --> 03:44:08.180]  and he flatly denied it. So we'll see how this goes. There's only, as we point out,
[03:44:08.180 --> 03:44:14.620]  there's only three Bill Maurers in LA, and one of them has a record of giving a million
[03:44:14.620 --> 03:44:20.260]  dollars to Democrat politicians. And of course, that was just the very last time that we had
[03:44:20.260 --> 03:44:25.060]  an election. And interestingly enough, think about it, okay? He had his thumb on the scale
[03:44:25.060 --> 03:44:31.780]  for Barack Obama when Barack Obama wasn't even in a challenge on his own party. He was
[03:44:31.780 --> 03:44:37.620]  running for reelection as a standing president, and yet he gave him a million dollars. Kind
[03:44:37.620 --> 03:44:41.260]  of makes me, kind of reminds me of something else that was in the DNC documents. You know,
[03:44:41.260 --> 03:44:44.500]  besides all the stuff about how they were rigging this for Sanders, one of the other
[03:44:44.500 --> 03:44:49.780]  things we saw in the DNC documents was how they had plans to reward big donors with
[03:44:49.780 --> 03:44:55.180]  all kinds of federal appointments or other goodies that are there, okay? We've seen
[03:44:55.180 --> 03:45:00.740]  this over and over again. There is a quid pro quo, and we've also seen some other history
[03:45:00.740 --> 03:45:05.460]  from Bill Maurer. It was back in February that he was put on a list of people who had
[03:45:05.460 --> 03:45:12.300]  given excessive, prohibited, and impermissible contributions. He had donated double the maximum
[03:45:12.300 --> 03:45:16.660]  amount to Bernie Sanders. And when I looked at this, I thought, well, okay, maybe what
[03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:22.180]  this was was sloppy record keeping on the Sanders campaign part. Maybe Bill Maurer gave
[03:45:22.180 --> 03:45:29.460]  the $2,700 from him, and he gave $2,700 from his wife, and they put it down as $5,400 from
[03:45:29.460 --> 03:45:35.660]  Bill Maurer, except Bill Maurer has never been married, okay? He gave $5,400 to Bernie
[03:45:35.660 --> 03:45:38.860]  Sanders. I don't know what happened with that investigation, but you know, the bottom line
[03:45:38.860 --> 03:45:44.820]  is folks, that's what they punished Dinesh D'Souza for. Did Bill Maurer get punished
[03:45:44.820 --> 03:45:51.460]  for that? No, no, didn't get punished. Meanwhile, one of the other things that came out of this
[03:45:51.460 --> 03:45:57.520]  Wicked Leaks exposure from the DNC, which I think is kind of interesting, is something
[03:45:57.520 --> 03:46:02.660]  else we were talking about at the beginning of the program. And that is how the big corporate
[03:46:02.660 --> 03:46:07.780]  crony capitalists are using the government to get precisely what they want and to shut
[03:46:07.780 --> 03:46:12.300]  down other industries. It was just Friday that I was talking to someone who was part
[03:46:12.300 --> 03:46:18.060]  of the low energy nuclear reaction research, also called coal fusion. He talked about how
[03:46:18.060 --> 03:46:22.580]  they had been shut down by the universities and military industrial complex that did not
[03:46:22.580 --> 03:46:26.340]  want to see coal fusion go through because they had a vested interest in their research
[03:46:26.340 --> 03:46:32.060]  projects of hot fusion. And we see that over and over again with various industries. Think
[03:46:32.060 --> 03:46:36.740]  about the war on drugs that we've got, okay? Think about the fact that, you know, we used
[03:46:36.740 --> 03:46:42.740]  to have alcohol prohibition, but of course, they worked their way. They got that repealed.
[03:46:42.740 --> 03:46:47.380]  I think it's a good thing. I don't like prohibition. I don't use marijuana. I don't use alcohol.
[03:46:47.380 --> 03:46:53.460]  But one of the things that Wicked Leaks emails exposed was the fact that the alcohol industry
[03:46:53.460 --> 03:46:59.980]  is waging a major campaign to lobby Washington to shut down pot. I mean, who would have thought,
[03:46:59.980 --> 03:47:05.900]  right? Of course, they're one of many industries that are part of this prohibition movement.
[03:47:05.900 --> 03:47:10.460]  The other ones that they mentioned in this Free Thought Project article, spot on, police
[03:47:10.460 --> 03:47:17.980]  unions, private prisons, pharmaceutical corporations. I don't want you using drugs that are grown
[03:47:17.980 --> 03:47:23.300]  like medical marijuana. They don't want you using that. They want you to get their patented
[03:47:23.300 --> 03:47:27.380]  drugs from big pharma, alcohol and beer companies. That's what this article was about. And of
[03:47:27.380 --> 03:47:31.300]  course, prison guard unions. So you got police unions, prison guard unions, the people who
[03:47:31.300 --> 03:47:35.660]  run the private prisons because we're locking up so many people in this. That's what I don't
[03:47:35.660 --> 03:47:41.340]  want to pay for, folks. I don't use this stuff. I don't use alcohol. I don't use marijuana.
[03:47:41.340 --> 03:47:46.220]  But I don't want to pay to lock people up. But there are people who do. And they want
[03:47:46.220 --> 03:47:51.780]  to make sure that the alcohol industry sees this as competition. Pharmaceuticals see this
[03:47:51.780 --> 03:47:57.420]  as competition, and they shut this down. But we also need to look at what it has done to
[03:47:57.420 --> 03:48:00.700]  destroy our country.
[03:48:00.700 --> 03:48:06.940]  When I saw this article about the U.N. backing Obama's secret takeover police, people on
[03:48:06.940 --> 03:48:12.580]  the left and the right need to understand that it was the U.N. that created the war
[03:48:12.580 --> 03:48:18.860]  on drugs. They came up with the blueprint, the detailed blueprint with the four different
[03:48:18.860 --> 03:48:22.620]  schedules and all the drugs put into those four different schedules. Initially, they
[03:48:22.620 --> 03:48:28.880]  did it 10 years before Richard Nixon said, we're going to have a war on drugs, okay?
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:32.740]  So all the conservatives out there who think that the way that they're going to have a
[03:48:32.740 --> 03:48:39.260]  better society is to give all of this power and authority to the federal government even.
[03:48:39.260 --> 03:48:43.500]  Not even local government, but to the federal government. Give them this hammer. Give them
[03:48:43.500 --> 03:48:49.420]  this gun so they can beat and intimidate people and jail people into being good. Now that
[03:48:49.420 --> 03:48:54.820]  isn't the way you do it. And it is really sad that conservatives think that you can
[03:48:54.820 --> 03:49:00.980]  coerce good behavior, that you can coerce this. It's a medical, it's a psychological,
[03:49:00.980 --> 03:49:05.780]  it is a spiritual issue. Whether it is alcohol or whether it is marijuana or whether it is
[03:49:05.780 --> 03:49:10.340]  some other substance, it'll always be something. There'll always be something out there because
[03:49:10.340 --> 03:49:17.260]  it's not the substance, it's the soul. That's where the problem is. But when you create
[03:49:17.260 --> 03:49:21.140]  prohibition, when you create prohibition like alcohol or when you create prohibition like
[03:49:21.140 --> 03:49:29.420]  drugs, what you're doing is you are essentially setting up a UN takeover of our police. You're
[03:49:29.420 --> 03:49:35.500]  setting up a destruction of our constitutional government. They never passed a constitutional
[03:49:35.500 --> 03:49:40.580]  amendment to prohibit marijuana. They did for alcohol because they didn't have the authority.
[03:49:40.580 --> 03:49:43.940]  And we had another constitutional amendment to take that away, but they've never done
[03:49:43.940 --> 03:49:49.260]  that for any of the rest of things because they don't even care what the law is. They
[03:49:49.260 --> 03:49:54.100]  do what they wish. And I think that was one of the most interesting takeaways in this
[03:49:54.100 --> 03:50:00.140]  back and forth between Bill Mauer and Julian Assange where Bill Mauer says, we don't want
[03:50:00.140 --> 03:50:04.940]  Trump ruling over us. In other words, they want Hillary Clinton ruling over us or they
[03:50:04.940 --> 03:50:09.340]  want Barack Obama ruling over us. I think that's one of the reasons why we see the liberals
[03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:14.740]  going absolutely crazy, trying to run people down with their cars when they see a Trump
[03:50:14.740 --> 03:50:20.260]  sign in the house where they vandalize houses, where they shoot people in an argument.
[03:50:20.260 --> 03:50:26.100]  Because in their minds, what the Democrats think we're doing is electing a dictator to
[03:50:26.100 --> 03:50:31.460]  rule over us. And we said all along, you guys are setting up a very dangerous president.
[03:50:31.460 --> 03:50:37.100]  You're letting Obama get away with anything, with money laundering, as we just saw here.
[03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:41.300]  You're letting Hillary Clinton get away with violating all the laws of national security.
[03:50:41.300 --> 03:50:46.140]  Don't you realize that when you give these people a pass for criminal activity merely
[03:50:46.140 --> 03:50:50.100]  because they're running for president, especially when they are president, you are setting up
[03:50:50.100 --> 03:50:55.460]  a system that is going to rub your nose into the ground when somebody from the other side
[03:50:55.460 --> 03:50:59.980]  gets in. That's what they're deathly afraid of. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[03:50:59.980 --> 03:51:05.740]  My name is Don Wiscan, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack, lost 35%
[03:51:05.740 --> 03:51:10.660]  of my heart to damaged tissue, and was supposed to spend the rest of my life on disability.
[03:51:10.660 --> 03:51:17.100]  What did I do? I took Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt
[03:51:17.100 --> 03:51:23.500]  my heart and gave me back my life. For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available

[03:52:55.660 --> 03:53:04.180]  1-800-954-9674. Today, I became a biophoton woman. I put a tablespoon of the Andreas 5-seat
[03:53:04.180 --> 03:53:09.740]  oil in my morning one-world-way drink and was still happy and energized at 3 p.m. Normally
[03:53:09.740 --> 03:53:14.860]  I feel tired and spacey at the end of the day, but today I felt energy and very clear.
[03:53:14.860 --> 03:53:18.820]  My friend at the farmers market asked what I was on. She said my eyes looked bright and
[03:53:18.820 --> 03:53:23.980]  I had unusual energy for that time of afternoon. I told her there was a magical oil that enabled
[03:53:23.980 --> 03:53:29.620]  my body to absorb the sun's energy as if I were a plant. She said, I want some. A second
[03:53:29.620 --> 03:53:34.100]  one-world-way shake with the oil when I got home took me to bedtime with that wonderful
[03:53:34.100 --> 03:53:39.660]  abundant energy. I couldn't believe how much I got done and how great I felt. The combination
[03:53:39.660 --> 03:53:44.980]  of one-world-way and 5-seat oil produced a significant health event in my life. The kind
[03:53:44.980 --> 03:53:49.500]  that makes you feel you've been given your life back with a bonus and I'm 64.

[03:53:57.820 --> 03:54:12.780]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight. In this last segment, we're going
[03:54:12.780 --> 03:54:18.540]  to talk a little bit about what's happened at the Hacking Conference, the DEFCON Hacking
[03:54:18.540 --> 03:54:23.860]  Conference in Las Vegas. I think it's very interesting for us to understand we have to
[03:54:23.860 --> 03:54:28.040]  get a background to understand current events. We have to know something about history because
[03:54:28.040 --> 03:54:32.500]  that tells us about human nature. But we also need to understand where some of this disruptive
[03:54:32.500 --> 03:54:37.140]  technology is taking us. That's one of the reasons that we talked to the gentleman from
[03:54:37.140 --> 03:54:44.260]  California, Brilowin Energy, talking about low energy nuclear reactions and was commonly
[03:54:44.260 --> 03:54:49.460]  known as cold fusion. Because there is always, it's not just the technology that's there.
[03:54:49.460 --> 03:54:53.900]  The technology has an opportunity to create an alliance with these crony capitalists and
[03:54:53.900 --> 03:54:58.580]  the government to control you and to shut down other industries. One of the things that's
[03:54:58.580 --> 03:55:04.580]  very disruptive about cold fusion is the fact that it could really play havoc with the
[03:55:04.580 --> 03:55:07.940]  bankers and their petrodollar. It could also play havoc with the idea they're going to
[03:55:07.940 --> 03:55:14.020]  put the power grid that controls us. But there's another control grid that is on the way and
[03:55:14.020 --> 03:55:19.020]  that is the transportation control grid. I want to talk about that briefly in light
[03:55:19.020 --> 03:55:24.180]  of the self-driving cars. Again, there's some more new news about that. And I keep coming
[03:55:24.180 --> 03:55:30.140]  back to the self-driving cars because folks, you don't really understand your freedoms
[03:55:30.140 --> 03:55:35.020]  until you lose them. We have grown up in this country with a freedom to move about. It was
[03:55:35.020 --> 03:55:40.780]  sold in the middle of the 20th century as the thing that you got out of that automobile.
[03:55:40.780 --> 03:55:45.300]  And yet we no longer appreciate that, especially in the younger people. Most of them are not
[03:55:45.300 --> 03:55:49.660]  looking at a car as something that's going to free them because they're so caught up
[03:55:49.660 --> 03:55:54.340]  in the virtual world. And let me tell you something. This control grid that they're
[03:55:54.340 --> 03:56:01.020]  setting up with these autonomous cars, with Uber, with Tesla, with the Department of Transportation,
[03:56:01.020 --> 03:56:04.660]  that is going to be something that is going to tie you down worse than anything you can
[03:56:04.660 --> 03:56:10.860]  imagine. It's going to be a massive control mechanism for the police state. Before we
[03:56:10.860 --> 03:56:15.980]  get back to that, I just want to remind you that we have one last chance for free shipping.
[03:56:15.980 --> 03:56:19.500]  This is only going to go for an additional 42 hours. We were running that as part of
[03:56:19.500 --> 03:56:25.060]  our special, everything at infowarsstore.com. Now is the time to take advantage of free
[03:56:25.060 --> 03:56:30.460]  shipping only another 42 hours. And we've had to pull pretty much all the specials,
[03:56:30.460 --> 03:56:37.900]  but we've pulled back one of the mega specials. Anthroplex is now 40% off at infowarslife.com.
[03:56:37.900 --> 03:56:42.380]  And of course, that is a way to deal with the hormone disrupting chemicals that you see
[03:56:42.380 --> 03:56:46.140]  in your environment all the time. Anthroplex was created to help fight back against that
[03:56:46.140 --> 03:56:50.460]  kind of attack on men. You can take it by itself or you compare it with supermail vitality
[03:56:50.460 --> 03:56:56.460]  for maximum effects. Again, that is 40% off Anthroplex. And we have another special that
[03:56:56.460 --> 03:57:02.900]  has just come out, 33% off the infowars solar base station power supply. Another way that
[03:57:02.900 --> 03:57:06.900]  you can get off the grid that you can start to establish your energy independence. See,
[03:57:06.900 --> 03:57:11.940]  that's the whole thing. They want you on an energy grid. They want you on a transportation
[03:57:11.940 --> 03:57:16.940]  grid. They want to control you with their fiat currency. This is a way that you can
[03:57:16.940 --> 03:57:23.140]  start chiseling away for some freedom and some independence, 33% off an infowars solar
[03:57:23.140 --> 03:57:28.260]  base station power supply, a great emergency backup source and a way that you can begin
[03:57:28.260 --> 03:57:33.740]  to kind of put your toe in the water about solar power and getting off the grid. That's
[03:57:33.740 --> 03:57:38.580]  the key thing about it is getting off the energy grid. Again, that's an infowarsstore.com.
[03:57:38.580 --> 03:57:45.820]  The 40% off Anthroplex is also at infowars.com and free shipping is going to end in 42 hours.
[03:57:45.820 --> 03:57:49.820]  Now, as we're talking about this control grid, I think it's kind of interesting what happened
[03:57:49.820 --> 03:57:54.900]  at the DEF CON hacker conference in Las Vegas. We've had in the last couple of months, we've
[03:57:54.900 --> 03:58:00.740]  had a lot of different crashes with Tesla's autopilot system. They said in the fatal crash,
[03:58:00.740 --> 03:58:04.820]  they said, no, it wasn't on autopilot. Now the preliminary report has come back from
[03:58:04.820 --> 03:58:08.980]  the National Transportation Safety Board said, yeah, it was. And it was going nine miles
[03:58:08.980 --> 03:58:13.060]  over the speed limit. But now we see, and we're going to cover this tonight on infowars
[03:58:13.060 --> 03:58:18.780]  nightly news, we see that they demonstrated multiple ways at the DEF CON hacker conference
[03:58:18.780 --> 03:58:22.940]  that they could confuse and could take over autopilot. Because essentially what they're
[03:58:22.940 --> 03:58:27.860]  doing is they're reflecting their sensors back. And all they have to do is send it some
[03:58:27.860 --> 03:58:32.660]  garbage and the thing goes completely haywire. Do you want that? Driving you, driving your
[03:58:32.660 --> 03:58:37.740]  family down the road, not me. Join us tonight for infowars nightly news. We'll go into more
[03:58:37.740 --> 03:58:46.460]  detail with that and other stories. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com
[03:58:46.460 --> 03:58:59.020]  today.
