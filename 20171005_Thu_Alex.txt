[00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.321]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:32.645]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:40.408]  Yet again, InfoWars is at the very tip of the spear, very cutting edge, the front line of exposing
[00:00:42.085 --> 00:00:44.927]  Real-time events have been proven right over and over again.
[00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:55.056]  Not only did I predict what was going to happen on Friday and on Sunday's broadcast, we also laid out the fact very early on that
[00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:04.090]  He was being investigated for ties to radicalization groups because that's what law enforcement reported to us on Monday morning.
[00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.131]  That was confirmed yesterday.
[00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:09.094]  We also said clearly he was not acting alone.
[00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:14.177]  And all of my military and law enforcement experts that we've interviewed on air and off air
[00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:25.505]  Including people like Craig Sawyer that led a major SEAL team said that it sounds like two different guns firing at two different speeds during different periods.
[00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:31.072]  But regardless, Paul Watson thinks from eyewitnesses that there's only one shooter.
[00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.812]  And the media makes hay of that like there's some wedge.
[00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:38.754]  Look, we're not like mainstream media where it's monolithic.
[00:01:38.754 --> 00:01:40.494]  And there's a cult here.
[00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:46.797]  I hire smart people that are investigators and then we go dig in and have different ideas about things.
[00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:56.280]  We're not a cult like MSM that gets media matters or Jordan Soros memos, that's now admitted, that's in the news today, admitting that.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.002]  We don't get handed down our talking points and then go push that.
[00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:08.937]  That there's no Islamic connection, even though there is, and that he acted alone day one, and that all gun owners are to blame.
[00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:11.758]  And that everyone inside there deserves to be shot.
[00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:13.378]  Because they're pro-gun.
[00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:15.419]  That's the Democratic Party talking point.
[00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.879]  We don't have talking points here.
[00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.680]  We develop ideas, research, that become...
[00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:25.799]  Dominant themes that get proven right over and over again because we're not running a cult.
[00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.560]  We actually try to find the truth.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.683]  Then the media will say, oh look, Jones is putting out lots of different ideas and things on this.
[00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:37.485]  As if I'm saying five different things are what happened.
[00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:39.945]  No, we're war gaming it.
[00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.466]  Same thing goes on at a detective's office at any police department.
[00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.826]  Or the same thing goes on in a corporation.
[00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:47.186]  War gaming business strategy.
[00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.427]  The same thing goes on in the military.
[00:02:49.427 --> 00:02:50.967]  Same thing goes on in the FBI.
[00:02:50.967 --> 00:02:52.027]  That's what people do.
[00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:53.308]  They have theories.
[00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:54.388]  They have ideas.
[00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:56.388]  They bounce things around.
[00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:58.148]  They have focus groups.
[00:02:58.148 --> 00:03:00.669]  That's what real thinking organizations do.
[00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.663]  The media tells you that you're not supposed to do that.
[00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:11.486]  If you go back to Monday, Deep State, Alex Jones says Deep State behind Vegas attack.
[00:03:11.486 --> 00:03:15.149]  But notice there's no actual quote around that.
[00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:20.452]  Because what I said was it looks like a Deep State operation and ISIS is taking responsibility.
[00:03:20.452 --> 00:03:24.894]  They later say I made it up that ISIS never took responsibility.
[00:03:24.894 --> 00:03:25.735]  That's not true!
[00:03:28.302 --> 00:03:30.483]  So we've got a big broadcast lined up today.
[00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:35.044]  We've got eyewitnesses that were there coming on, and more.
[00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:37.125]  But there's the headline on Drudge Report.
[00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:45.088]  He had a secret life, did not act alone, and was an allergy freak.
[00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:51.550]  Booked Hotel Overlooking Lollapalooza.
[00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.191]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.452]  And the Sheriff's Department's come out and said,
[00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.303]  Didn't act alone, they believe.
[00:03:58.303 --> 00:04:00.444]  Obviously had to have some type of help.
[00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:04.666]  They don't believe there were two shooters, but they believe he had help.
[00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:05.146]  No kidding.
[00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:08.388]  Getting into the hotel for five days, not being identified.
[00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:10.229]  This is hiding in plain view.
[00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.950]  And the target is the motive as well.
[00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.792]  But we told you, didn't act alone, connections to radicalization.
[00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:21.394]  That came from law enforcement sources that were in the middle of it.
[00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:25.056]  And as usual, we're proven correct yet again.
[00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:35.183]  Because we have the sources, we have the research, we have the history and understanding of this.
[00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:38.066]  But Jimmy Kimmel says it's all gun owners fault.
[00:04:38.066 --> 00:04:41.509]  That means Chuckie Schumer says it because they admit Chuckie Schumer programs him.
[00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:42.890]  We've got that coming up.
[00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.812]  And of course they want to ban all semi-autos as usual.
[00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:46.273]  They're coming.
[00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:55.686]  We've got Trump statements and a lot more today and then we've also got the Somali refugee and the terror attack last weekend in Canada.
[00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.767]  Turns out he was deported out of the United States.
[00:04:57.767 --> 00:04:58.207]  We'll be back.
[00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:10.877]  A staunch anti-federalist, Patrick Henry was opposed to the Constitution, fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only the sovereign states that had created it, but that it would become a tool to destroy individual liberty.
[00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:13.859]  His warnings, ignored, have now come to pass.
[00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:22.425]  He said, you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased, nor how you are to become a great and powerful people, but how your liberties can be secured.
[00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:25.087]  For liberty ought to be the direct end of your government.
[00:05:25.327 --> 00:05:33.473]  Patrick Henry warned us, the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them.
[00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:37.816]  Today, everything the government does, at every level, is concealed from us.
[00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:42.739]  We have trade deals to manage our economy that not even our elected representatives are allowed to see.
[00:05:42.739 --> 00:05:48.983]  Later in life, Patrick Henry looked back and said, when the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different.
[00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.145]  Liberty, sir, was the primary object.
[00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:54.647]  Today, our primary concern is safety and comfort.
[00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:57.016]  When we should be demanding liberty.
[00:05:57.016 --> 00:05:59.025]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:06:25.054 --> 00:06:29.396]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.396 --> 00:06:40.582]  What we are looking at, good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:42.643]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:42.643 --> 00:06:49.327]  I have Newsweek, I have Time Magazine, I have the New York Times, I have the Washington Post, I have the Austin American Statesman.
[00:06:50.909 --> 00:07:05.968]  All coming out on Monday and saying, I'm crazy because I believe that Paddock did not act alone, and now the Sheriff's Department has come out and said that there's no way he acted by himself, and they're investigating his ties to radicalization groups.
[00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.774]  Exactly what I told you from our sources in law enforcement.
[00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:12.977]  And what did the Southern Harvey Law Center do?
[00:07:12.977 --> 00:07:17.041]  What did the Media Matters Group, openly funded by Soros, do?
[00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:18.703]  What did the mouth of Soros do?
[00:07:18.703 --> 00:07:20.866]  It said that I made that up.
[00:07:20.866 --> 00:07:22.227]  No, I have real sources.
[00:07:22.227 --> 00:07:23.929]  I'm proven right.
[00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:24.910]  You're a fraud.
[00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.471]  You're a joke.
[00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:38.580]  But before I get into all of this huge breaking news and the new tropical storm and all the rest of it, I want to play a special report by Paul Joseph Watson that breaks it all down.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.644]  Paul Joseph Watson, strange things about the Vegas massacre.
[00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.391]  To be clear, this video contains no graphic images at all.
[00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:50.674]  And the second half will be a debunking of all the stupid conspiracies floating around about this tragedy.
[00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:53.395]  But first, let's discuss what's yet to be explained.
[00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:58.318]  Who was Gunman Steven Paddock's hotel room guest when he ordered room service for two people?
[00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:01.700]  At the Mandalay Bay Hotel, four days before the massacre.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.760]  This is the receipt.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:17.407]  There you see the number of guests, two separate meals, a code that means in-room dining, Mandalay Bay, and table number 32135, which equates to Paddock's room number, 135, on the 32nd floor.
[00:08:17.407 --> 00:08:23.190]  Why did this receipt show him in the hotel September 27, when authorities said he checked in September 28?
[00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:23.971]  Follow ahead, boss.
[00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:48.135]  I'm not going to give you the whole report, it's on Infowars.com, but since Paul put this out yesterday and since we broke it, and since Drudge ran our big headline about receipts and somebody visited the room, the Sheriff's Department came out and confirmed last night in the same press conference where they said they believe he didn't act alone, quote, there's no way he acted alone, and they're investigating radicalization again, what we first broke.
[00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:52.696]  They confirmed that indeed he did have a visitor, a woman.
[00:08:52.696 --> 00:08:53.797]  So BOOM!
[00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:54.577]  BOOM!
[00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:55.438]  Broke that again!
[00:08:55.438 --> 00:08:56.919]  Infowars right again!
[00:08:56.919 --> 00:08:58.480]  Drudge Report right again!
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.661]  Real News!
[00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:00.862]  Leading the pack!
[00:09:00.862 --> 00:09:04.625]  Forcing MSM to follow us!
[00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.006]  BOOM!
[00:09:06.006 --> 00:09:06.706]  BOOM!
[00:09:06.706 --> 00:09:07.407]  How's it feel?
[00:09:09.926 --> 00:09:11.469]  How you like us now?
[00:09:11.469 --> 00:09:12.771]  How you like the fake news now?
[00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:14.033]  We're the real news.
[00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:15.215]  You're the fake news.
[00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:17.418]  That's why you brand us to be what you are.
[00:09:17.418 --> 00:09:18.640]  We're the resistance.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.982]  You're the establishment.
[00:09:19.982 --> 00:09:21.745]  Kimmel and all the rest of you.
[00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:22.606]  Let's go back to it.
[00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.572]  And was it the same woman that warned concert goers they were about to die?
[00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:37.376]  So there was a lady who pushed her way forward into the concert venue, into the first row, and she started messing with another lady and told us that we were all gonna die tonight.
[00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.616]  Do you know why she was saying that?
[00:09:38.616 --> 00:09:41.678]  I mean, was this after, gosh, the shots were fired, or?
[00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:46.680]  It was about 45 minutes before the shots were actually fired, but then she was escorted out by security.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:52.122]  Obviously, this guest needs to be tracked down because he or she could have been in on the plot.
[00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:53.882]  Then we have this disturbing footage.
[00:09:53.882 --> 00:10:05.887]  And I'm not gonna play it, but before the bit I am about to play, a man is walking through the site of the massacre after the shooting ends, trying to draw attention to people who are still alive so they can get medical treatment.
[00:10:05.887 --> 00:10:11.889]  It's horrific, it's chilling, but it proves that many people who lay there dying were still alive.
[00:10:11.889 --> 00:10:12.869]  Then this happens.
[00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:14.270]  No EMTs.
[00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.690]  They've turned the lights off.
[00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.250]  Where are the EMTs?
[00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.951]  Why are the lights off?
[00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:20.092]  We turned the lights off to secure the area.
[00:10:20.092 --> 00:10:21.873]  Shooting's already stopped.
[00:10:21.873 --> 00:10:24.714]  Shooting was going on during the shooting.
[00:10:24.714 --> 00:10:28.535]  Now we need lights to assess victims and assign EMTs.
[00:10:28.535 --> 00:10:32.497]  Okay, everybody right now that's here on ground is deceased.
[00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:33.438]  No, they're not.
[00:10:33.438 --> 00:10:35.218]  I got EMTs working on the guy here.
[00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:37.059]  I got EMTs working on the guy here.
[00:10:37.059 --> 00:10:39.760]  I got an EMT and a nurse working on the guy over here.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.101]  I need lights on.
[00:10:42.081 --> 00:10:45.704]  If you know how to do that, get these lights back on!
[00:10:45.704 --> 00:10:52.170]  So whoever made the decision to turn off the lights, did that prevent dying victims from getting help?
[00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:58.976]  Or was it a rational decision to avoid lighting up the whole area to prevent the further targeting of these victims?
[00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:04.600]  And remember, the shooting was over at this point, but you can see it from both perspectives, so you be the judge.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:11.406]  Then there's this footage of victims running in terror, while one group of people just nonchalantly stands there.
[00:11:11.406 --> 00:11:20.213]  One of them is even vaping as the gunshots go off.
[00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:24.176]  The group only seems perturbed when a bullet literally almost hits them.
[00:11:30.777 --> 00:11:36.898]  And perhaps they were just completely wasted, but it's odd how some people behave differently to others in a crisis.
[00:11:36.898 --> 00:11:46.001]  We now know that gunman Steven Paddock was prescribed diazepam, more commonly known as its brand name Valium, which is linked to aggression and violent outbursts.
[00:11:46.001 --> 00:11:54.463]  Although Paddock's massacre was obviously carefully planned in advance, did the drug contribute in any way to his egregious act of aggression?
[00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:57.804]  Authorities now acknowledge that the shooter could have been radicalized,
[00:11:57.944 --> 00:12:03.950]  I want to understand the motivation that you describe, okay, to prevent any future incidents.
[00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:10.017]  And, you know, did this person get radicalized unbeknownst to us, and we want to identify that source.
[00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:15.142]  Which suggests they suspect there could be some kind of political or personal motive.
[00:12:15.282 --> 00:12:20.606]  Which brings us to the biggest thing yet to be explained, which is of course the motive, and if there was one.
[00:12:20.606 --> 00:12:28.411]  Given the nature of the event, intelligence expert Colonel Tony Schaefer was explicit in who he thought the gunman was targeting.
[00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:31.393]  It's shaping up to be a very deliberate act of terror.
[00:12:31.393 --> 00:12:37.477]  This individual parallels in many ways by age and by predisposition of being unstable the shooter who
[00:12:37.897 --> 00:12:38.158]  I think?
[00:12:59.198 --> 00:13:01.019]  So it's a stranger mass homicide?
[00:13:15.365 --> 00:13:18.568]  And a stranger mass homicide happens for one of two reasons.
[00:13:18.568 --> 00:13:27.135]  Either a person acting for a cause or a person acting because he wants to transcend notoriety and kill as many people as possible like a James Holmes.
[00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:31.578]  People who commit crimes for notoriety alone are young and he's not.
[00:13:31.578 --> 00:13:39.084]  Absolutely people who are gun enthusiasts and who are populists or nationalists in this country are dehumanized.
[00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.045]  They're demonized.
[00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:41.787]  The point is his mindset
[00:13:42.347 --> 00:13:43.708]  Is that they deserve to die?
[00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:44.048]  Yes.
[00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:52.294]  And so a person who adopts the cause may be otherwise law-abiding, but he feels righteously justified that the end justifies the means.
[00:13:52.294 --> 00:13:55.115]  You said look at the target and work your way backwards.
[00:13:55.115 --> 00:13:55.576]  That's right.
[00:13:55.576 --> 00:13:58.978]  What do country music fans and country music artists represent?
[00:13:59.318 --> 00:14:00.118]  It's Americana.
[00:14:00.118 --> 00:14:03.060]  What was written on the note seen in Paddock's hotel room?
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:08.583]  Why did he wire $100,000 to the Philippines and is the ISIS connection still in play?
[00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:12.404]  What does his girlfriend know and why did she have two social security numbers?
[00:14:12.404 --> 00:14:15.406]  Why was she married to two men at the same time?
[00:14:15.506 --> 00:14:18.288]  She would know everything intimately, Martha, about what he was doing.
[00:14:18.288 --> 00:14:31.096]  You cannot get past having a house full of guns by someone who is not in the military, has no previous record of wanting to do things with guns, all of a sudden he buys these, and we're talking about, I've been told, an estimate of $100,000 worth of high-end weapons.
[00:14:33.197 --> 00:14:33.697]  Unbelievable.
[00:14:33.697 --> 00:14:34.958]  So it's clearly something there.
[00:14:34.958 --> 00:14:41.440]  And if it was an attack on Trump supporters, that doesn't mean all Hillary Clinton voters or all leftists are to blame.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.222]  Let's not stoop to their level by collectively demonizing everyone with whom we disagree.
[00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:54.604]  Like CNN did today by publishing this article entitled, How America Has Silently Accepted the Rage of White Men.
[00:14:54.604 --> 00:14:57.885]  When most of the massacre victims were white men.
[00:14:57.885 --> 00:15:02.687]  Next on CNN, How Europe Has Silently Accepted the Rage of Muslim Men.
[00:15:02.807 --> 00:15:03.928]  Would they publish that?
[00:15:03.928 --> 00:15:04.569]  No!
[00:15:04.569 --> 00:15:06.371]  So why are they publishing this?
[00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:13.279]  Stop being racist, stop encouraging actual white supremacists, and stop inciting violence.
[00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:15.521]  As soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief.
[00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:18.444]  White people shooting white people isn't terror, it's community outreach!
[00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:21.307]  That kind of crap, that has to stop!
[00:15:21.307 --> 00:15:26.791]  But finding out the motive of the killer, if there was one, will help address the root cause.
[00:15:26.791 --> 00:15:36.219]  And possibly begin to make it clear to people that resorting to violence just because you think you have the moral high ground is not acceptable in a civilized society.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:46.450]  Folks, we've got to go to break, and that is true that the flashing is a strobe light.
[00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.413]  That's been debunked, so the poll then goes into all that.
[00:15:49.413 --> 00:15:56.561]  But the jury's still out on whether there were two shooters, and all of my military and law enforcement experts say they think they're hearing two guns go off.
[00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:57.342]  It's not just an echo.
[00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:02.977]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:07.757]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:18:07.757 --> 00:18:08.297]  That's right.
[00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:13.559]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rights Freeze Dryers.
[00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:19.982]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[00:18:20.222 --> 00:18:27.829]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[00:18:27.829 --> 00:18:28.069]  Woo!
[00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:29.110]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:37.838]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:45.945]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:50.873]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:18:50.873 --> 00:18:54.981]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:56.063]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:18:56.063 --> 00:18:58.648]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:00.243 --> 00:19:04.004]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:19:04.004 --> 00:19:11.725]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:19:11.725 --> 00:19:20.347]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:19:20.347 --> 00:19:24.408]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:34.590]  Pathogens added to the food and water, into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.010]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:49.132]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:19:49.132 --> 00:19:52.053]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:19:52.053 --> 00:19:53.953]  It's time for us to take our bodies back
[00:19:54.213 --> 00:19:56.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:10.404 --> 00:20:16.992]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:48.096]  It's a fact, InfoWars has been the most accurate media operation so far telling you that he did not act alone and they were investigating him for connections to radicals because of what was found in the hotel room.
[00:20:48.096 --> 00:20:53.158]  Thanks to DrugsReport.com magnifying those articles, having the courage to run our articles,
[00:20:54.693 --> 00:21:12.308]  A lot of people are now able to get more information to the police, more information to the media, and we have Colonel Schaeffer of the CIA, high level, and you have top psychiatrists and many other top experts saying, the motive is the target, the target is the motive.
[00:21:12.308 --> 00:21:14.129]  A bunch of Christian Trump supporters.
[00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:18.693]  This guy's whole background, the intelligence agency cut out.
[00:21:20.017 --> 00:21:24.359]  The millions and millions he spent on gambling was able to do it for 20 years.
[00:21:24.359 --> 00:21:27.060]  Nobody can do that.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.081]  In the long run, the house always wins.
[00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:44.749]  And the guy bought all these houses and had a lavish lifestyle and two airplanes and has the classic cutout with his foreign girlfriends and traveling to the Philippines, the Middle East, of a weapons runner.
[00:21:46.954 --> 00:22:08.298]  Oh, his brother said he didn't really have any guns, he wasn't into hunting, oh, he'd never do this, to, oh, he was a big secret gun owner with a big secret gun vault, and he led a secret life, and he worked for Lockheed, and he worked for NASA, and he worked for all these shadowy groups, on and on and on.
[00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:10.359]  We don't know exactly what's going on.
[00:22:11.277 --> 00:22:15.080]  But we know mainstream media is lying to us.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.723]  And we know they're using this against gun owners.
[00:22:18.723 --> 00:22:23.808]  And we know his brother... I mean, read the transcripts when he was first interviewed by Reuters.
[00:22:23.808 --> 00:22:25.449]  Oh, he didn't have guns.
[00:22:25.449 --> 00:22:27.090]  Oh, he would never do anything like this.
[00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.191]  Oh, no.
[00:22:28.191 --> 00:22:29.372]  He didn't lead a double life.
[00:22:29.372 --> 00:22:30.553]  It was so nice.
[00:22:30.553 --> 00:22:34.376]  This was impossible.
[00:22:34.376 --> 00:22:34.757]  And now...
[00:22:36.974 --> 00:22:38.035]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:22:38.035 --> 00:22:40.117]  He's a total genius mastermind.
[00:22:40.117 --> 00:22:41.699]  He's unstoppable.
[00:22:41.699 --> 00:22:44.181]  My brother did this.
[00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:46.524]  48 hours later, he is conclusive.
[00:22:46.524 --> 00:22:49.266]  My brother did this.
[00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:51.168]  Period.
[00:22:51.168 --> 00:22:52.009]  100%.
[00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.711]  That's what's going on.
[00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:55.012]  Open and shut.
[00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:56.874]  Well, do I believe the brother from two days before?
[00:22:56.874 --> 00:22:58.736]  Or the brother of yesterday?
[00:23:00.336 --> 00:23:04.858]  Las Vegas gunman Steven Paddock was not an avid gun guy at all, didn't hunt, you name it.
[00:23:04.858 --> 00:23:09.680]  Now he's a gun nut and his friends all knew it.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.142]  His brother also said, he took care of us, he made us all rich.
[00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.262]  Oh, he was buying people houses.
[00:23:15.262 --> 00:23:18.984]  He just had all this money.
[00:23:18.984 --> 00:23:20.485]  And how do you launder drug money?
[00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:23.826]  How do you launder gun money?
[00:23:23.826 --> 00:23:26.007]  And that's what our sources have been telling us for two days.
[00:23:26.007 --> 00:23:27.828]  They said, look at gun running.
[00:23:29.082 --> 00:23:36.028]  Look at him doing clandestine activity and boom, that's what we're now getting.
[00:23:36.028 --> 00:23:43.475]  He bought 33 guns in one year and a $600 rifle on the way to Vegas is missing.
[00:23:43.475 --> 00:23:47.339]  That's being reported right now.
[00:23:47.339 --> 00:23:53.664]  Now he spent decades hoarding guns, did not act alone, says the Sheriff's Department.
[00:23:53.664 --> 00:23:55.406]  Let's go ahead and go to his brother.
[00:23:57.298 --> 00:24:18.036]  from a clip earlier in the week on Monday to a clip yesterday and just look at the total flipping but mainly how he's like someone's talking to him and he's screwing up his lines or he's got a mental condition and I don't say that meanly but he's the squirreliest guy
[00:24:20.413 --> 00:24:22.234]  I've ever seen in a big event like this.
[00:24:22.234 --> 00:24:27.255]  I mean, if I was a Hollywood director, I would cast this guy as Mr. Squirrely.
[00:24:27.255 --> 00:24:34.338]  He'd be known in the script as Squirrel Man, Mr. Sneaky, Mr. Weasel.
[00:24:34.338 --> 00:24:37.659]  So here he is.
[00:24:37.659 --> 00:24:47.783]  It appears not just going off lines he memorized, but he looks like a seven-year-old in their first play of Captain Hook not remembering his lines, and you hear the director going,
[00:24:50.017 --> 00:24:54.563]  Now he swallows the alarm clock!
[00:24:54.563 --> 00:24:57.827]  Or now say, I'll get you Peter Pan!
[00:24:57.827 --> 00:24:59.128]  Oh, now I'll get you Peter Pan!
[00:24:59.128 --> 00:25:07.018]  Is that what you... You can hear him being fed the lines by an earpiece, or he's like one of those guys you see on the street corner that's talking to themselves.
[00:25:07.018 --> 00:25:07.339]  Here it is.
[00:25:12.313 --> 00:25:12.793]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:12.793 --> 00:25:14.734]  I mean, that's the thing I shouldn't have said.
[00:25:14.734 --> 00:25:29.699]  But that's what people are, I mean, that he's this, you know, but he's a highly intelligent what, I mean, there's absolutely no, and this is the other part that I want to stress with this, that it, I mean, it doesn't matter that they won't chase people, but people are saying, oh, he must have had help.
[00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:31.239]  Steve had no help.
[00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:33.000]  Steve didn't take help.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.060]  It did not take a village for Steve.
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.621]  Steve was an army.
[00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:36.961]  I'm sorry.
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.942]  Please don't.
[00:25:40.942 --> 00:25:47.067]  I'm using a colloquial... I was about to use a colloquial term that would besmudge one of the armed forces.
[00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:50.690]  Steve was a stand-alone guy.
[00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.851]  Okay?
[00:25:51.851 --> 00:26:00.698]  Steve... If you wanted to hang out with Steve, you hung out with Steve, but you had to understand Steve was a little quirky.
[00:26:02.238 --> 00:26:04.040]  Here, I mean, here's the story.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.362]  You know, here's how Steve is.
[00:26:06.362 --> 00:26:17.871]  I would go, you know, when I was flying or whatever, if he was in town and I happened to be flying over, I'd stop in where, you know, we'd go to the hotel and stay at the hotel for a couple days or something and sit under the cabana or something like that.
[00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:21.654]  But with Steve, it was, it was like,
[00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:31.185]  He'd spend, you know, I'd get to partake of a bunch of thousands of dollars of comps on the hotel.
[00:26:31.185 --> 00:26:35.709]  Oh my gosh, I mean, these people are just disgusting.
[00:26:35.709 --> 00:26:39.652]  Disgusting rat creature, I'm sorry I have to say.
[00:26:39.652 --> 00:26:43.915]  He doesn't even seem sorry, he's just all a bunch of attention for him, and he's lying.
[00:26:43.915 --> 00:26:52.823]  He's either lying before he's lying now, and I'm not for waterboarding, but I'd like to get some answers.
[00:26:54.642 --> 00:26:58.805]  Out of this guy right here.
[00:26:58.805 --> 00:27:09.174]  Because if somebody's gonna get the Baloney Award, the Bravo Sierra Award, it goes to little brother here.
[00:27:09.174 --> 00:27:10.795]  So these are the issues we're looking at.
[00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:16.840]  Now when we come back from break, obviously the big enchilada is they're coming for our guns.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.881]  We knew it was gonna happen.
[00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:20.303]  And don't forget the climate.
[00:27:20.303 --> 00:27:22.465]  Don't forget the target.
[00:27:22.465 --> 00:27:23.346]  Don't forget the intel.
[00:27:24.753 --> 00:27:26.473]  But remember the season.
[00:27:26.473 --> 00:27:29.094]  We're coming after your guns in October and November.
[00:27:29.094 --> 00:27:30.315]  We're coming after Trump.
[00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:31.835]  We're coming after the Tea Party.
[00:27:31.835 --> 00:27:32.515]  We're coming after you.
[00:27:32.515 --> 00:27:33.595]  We're going to kill people.
[00:27:33.595 --> 00:27:34.956]  Hashtag not Republicans.
[00:27:34.956 --> 00:27:36.316]  You think Scalise was big?
[00:27:36.316 --> 00:27:37.557]  It's going to be a lot worse.
[00:27:37.557 --> 00:27:38.217]  We're coming.
[00:27:38.217 --> 00:27:39.217]  We're training.
[00:27:39.217 --> 00:27:40.917]  All last week I'm saying it's imminent.
[00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:41.618]  It's imminent.
[00:27:41.618 --> 00:27:42.098]  It's imminent.
[00:27:42.098 --> 00:27:49.700]  The night of the attack I've got anti-terrorism expert on saying the left launching huge false flags is imminent.
[00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:58.959]  Like if I told somebody it's imminent, your house is about to get robbed, and then it gets robbed, either I know who did it, or I did it.
[00:27:58.959 --> 00:28:02.783]  I mean, I don't just pull this stuff out of a hat.
[00:28:02.783 --> 00:28:04.004]  And then we continue to be right.
[00:28:05.592 --> 00:28:08.855]  And I'm telling you, they're gauging our response right now.
[00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:10.756]  They've got their teams ready.
[00:28:10.756 --> 00:28:12.798]  The deep state, the globalists are ruthless.
[00:28:12.798 --> 00:28:14.259]  They overthrow countries all the time.
[00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:17.702]  This is how they overthrew Ukraine was with mass shootings, starting a civil war.
[00:28:17.702 --> 00:28:21.124]  And they're getting ready to launch attacks even bigger.
[00:28:21.124 --> 00:28:23.166]  Hundreds and hundreds of dead.
[00:28:23.166 --> 00:28:28.010]  Schools, NFL games, rock concerts, you name it.
[00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:31.979]  And they're going to blame the American gun owner.
[00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:34.760]  I told you, and they've already done it.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.441]  It's already happening.
[00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:38.883]  It's happening in live time.
[00:28:38.883 --> 00:28:44.126]  They're already seizing on it and blaming every one of you that owns a firearm to protect yourselves.
[00:28:44.126 --> 00:28:45.947]  They say you're to blame.
[00:28:45.947 --> 00:28:53.871]  And I've got the clip of Jimmy Kimmel directly quoting his boss, Chuckie Schumer, who tells him every night what to say.
[00:28:53.871 --> 00:28:54.992]  Kimmel's proud of it.
[00:28:54.992 --> 00:28:57.854]  Kimmel's a dirtbag puppet who hates America.
[00:28:58.806 --> 00:29:05.075]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:55.149]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:59.292]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:03.936]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[00:31:03.936 --> 00:31:11.582]  InfoWarsLife brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano-silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[00:31:11.582 --> 00:31:15.826]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[00:31:15.826 --> 00:31:19.909]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free mouthwash
[00:31:20.129 --> 00:31:21.950]  And supercharge your oral health.
[00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:28.553]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:31:28.553 --> 00:31:38.917]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:31:38.917 --> 00:31:45.720]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.301]  Xylitol, Nanosilver, and Iodine.
[00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:51.722]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:54.083]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:54.083 --> 00:31:55.443]  It's the air we're breathing.
[00:31:55.443 --> 00:31:56.564]  Especially for our children.
[00:31:56.564 --> 00:31:58.604]  The artificial particulates.
[00:31:58.604 --> 00:31:59.505]  The chemicals.
[00:32:08.968 --> 00:32:12.250]  This is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:21.437]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:32:21.437 --> 00:32:28.983]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:32:28.983 --> 00:32:37.009]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:37.950]  The general public doesn't.
[00:32:39.176 --> 00:32:43.119]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:46.682]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:32:46.682 --> 00:32:53.387]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:32:53.387 --> 00:33:02.174]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:02.174 --> 00:33:04.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:21.858]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:21.858 --> 00:33:23.439]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:23.439 --> 00:33:27.102]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:37.032 --> 00:33:40.193]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:40.193 --> 00:33:41.773]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.773 --> 00:33:58.117]  And I'm going to suspend the coverage of what happened in Vegas for this segment because I have breaking news and analysis of the highest importance for everybody that will save millions of people's lives if you'll simply listen to me.
[00:33:58.117 --> 00:33:59.857]  This is a critical emergency alert.
[00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:15.508]  And it's just an example of how the literature is totally known and the doctors completely know this and won't tell you until they understand you've got an acute issue and the next time there's a good chance you will die.
[00:34:17.605 --> 00:34:22.507]  This is key because they only tell you this when they know you're on the edge.
[00:34:22.507 --> 00:34:29.971]  But they don't tell you because in their training and the health department brainwashing, they tell them, yes, we know vaccines kill a bunch of people.
[00:34:29.971 --> 00:34:31.872]  Yes, we know they brain damage people.
[00:34:31.872 --> 00:34:34.233]  Yes, we know they cause autoimmune problems.
[00:34:34.233 --> 00:34:36.655]  Yes, we know they cause type 1 diabetes.
[00:34:36.655 --> 00:34:39.396]  Yes, we know they cause hundreds of neurological disorders.
[00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:43.538]  But for the greater good, we have to lie to the public and say safe and effective.
[00:34:43.538 --> 00:34:44.939]  But if they have a bad reaction,
[00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:56.134]  An autoimmune reaction, we've got to tell them, you can't take the vaccine again, it'll probably kill you next time.
[00:34:56.134 --> 00:35:09.660]  Now, I hadn't seen one of our crew in a few days, and they said, well, since some of us have been sick, she was kind of sick, so, and I'm not going to say her name, let me tell the story, she's going to be out of this office for a while.
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.401]  I'm just busy, I go, okay, whatever.
[00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:15.580]  Then I see her in the coffee room wearing a mask, and I said, what happened to you?
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.844]  And she said, well, I took the typhoid vaccine they recommend.
[00:35:18.844 --> 00:35:21.648]  By the way, they make you take that to go to college.
[00:35:21.648 --> 00:35:24.291]  Bunch of other really, really dangerous ones.
[00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:25.913]  Meningitis vaccines, you name it.
[00:35:25.913 --> 00:35:28.236]  Which, by the way, the inserts say don't even protect you.
[00:35:28.236 --> 00:35:29.157]  Viral or bacterial.
[00:35:30.635 --> 00:35:32.576]  And I said, and I said, oh, what happened?
[00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:35.677]  Well, I took it once before, I didn't do it, but this time it made me real sick.
[00:35:35.677 --> 00:35:38.257]  And I said, yeah, you take it a third time, it might kill you.
[00:35:38.257 --> 00:35:40.478]  And she goes, no, that's exactly what the doctor said.
[00:35:40.478 --> 00:35:42.979]  He said, don't ever take in a vaccine again.
[00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:44.299]  You just can't take vaccines again.
[00:35:44.299 --> 00:35:51.422]  Now, how did I tell her the default exact thing her doctor told her?
[00:35:51.422 --> 00:35:53.162]  Because there's handbooks!
[00:35:53.162 --> 00:35:54.183]  It's not my opinion!
[00:35:54.183 --> 00:35:55.283]  I'm not that smart!
[00:35:59.173 --> 00:36:03.698]  I'm just crazy enough to go up against these people.
[00:36:03.698 --> 00:36:09.524]  Every year in early August, they have articles all over the newspapers that are paid for by the vaccine companies.
[00:36:09.524 --> 00:36:11.807]  They pay to run these as ads.
[00:36:11.807 --> 00:36:13.008]  They call them advertorials.
[00:36:13.008 --> 00:36:14.330]  They don't tell you it's paid for by them.
[00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.451]  It's really illegal.
[00:36:18.135 --> 00:36:20.637]  One time I was talking about this in the local paper.
[00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:22.819]  They said, how would you like to have advertorials?
[00:36:22.819 --> 00:36:24.060]  Stop talking about it.
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.043]  And I had a big affiliate once when I was doing the San Jones.
[00:36:27.043 --> 00:36:28.043]  Will you please stop?
[00:36:28.043 --> 00:36:30.966]  Because we get a lot of our ads are those.
[00:36:30.966 --> 00:36:36.530]  Where it sounds like it's a hospital district or it sounds like it's some informational deal or it's on the news.
[00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.092]  It's not news, it's paid for.
[00:36:38.092 --> 00:36:41.234]  The point is I know all about it!
[00:36:41.234 --> 00:36:42.676]  Up one side and down the other.
[00:36:42.676 --> 00:36:44.017]  And you know how frustrating it is?
[00:36:46.277 --> 00:36:53.321]  To know that they all know the vaccines are hurting you, and in the greater good, garbage isn't even true.
[00:36:53.321 --> 00:36:58.124]  And the vaccine companies since 1983 have total liability protection, and the U.S.
[00:36:58.124 --> 00:37:07.830]  has the dirtiest, worst vaccines in the world, that even authorize live HIV and hepatitis to be in the Factor VIII products.
[00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:12.493]  Our government told Bayer, we don't care if it's got HIV, give it to people!
[00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:18.769]  Now, Factor VIII is a blood product for clotting for hemophiliacs.
[00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:24.437]  The point is, it's in that class of what you call, you know, like a vaccine.
[00:37:24.437 --> 00:37:26.540]  Something you're injecting into your body to fortify you.
[00:37:27.927 --> 00:37:33.512]  Because when you're vaccine, it's this huge giant classes of nanotech and attenuated viruses.
[00:37:33.512 --> 00:37:36.334]  It's something they're putting in your body.
[00:37:36.334 --> 00:37:39.537]  A lot of it's live viruses now, even reprogram areas of the brain.
[00:37:39.537 --> 00:37:43.841]  And by that, they selectively eat certain receptor sites.
[00:37:43.841 --> 00:37:48.885]  They call it the anti-stress vaccines, one of them, or the anti-drug addiction, anti-opiate vaccine.
[00:37:48.885 --> 00:37:54.330]  It actually goes in and destroys the receptors in the brain for it.
[00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:59.597]  Except now you're going to be totally calm and never have euphoria.
[00:37:59.597 --> 00:38:00.698]  What does heroin do?
[00:38:00.698 --> 00:38:04.141]  It imitates natural receptor sites.
[00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:13.310]  Like you get into some knock-down, drag-out fight and you barely survive, for about 30 minutes you're going to be feeling like you're on heroin.
[00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:21.057]  You break your leg, naturally, it hurts real bad, but a few minutes in you're like euphoric, before you even get to the hospital and they shoot you up with opium.
[00:38:24.494 --> 00:38:28.858]  They shoot you up with the medicalized garbage.
[00:38:28.858 --> 00:38:33.363]  So, that's why I'm so angry.
[00:38:33.363 --> 00:38:36.586]  Is that they say, you want to go to college?
[00:38:36.586 --> 00:38:38.168]  You want to go out of the country?
[00:38:38.168 --> 00:38:39.049]  You want to do any of these things?
[00:38:39.049 --> 00:38:40.490]  You got to take all these shots.
[00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:43.053]  And they know full well, you know the officers.
[00:38:44.344 --> 00:38:50.886]  In every major military, from the Communist Chinese to our own military, do not take the vaccines.
[00:38:50.886 --> 00:39:09.872]  And when there is something dangerous out, they have special laboratories, mainly in Switzerland, that produce high-end vaccines that actually have in them what they say, and will actually give you learned immunity, artificial immunity, and still may have side effects, but aren't one
[00:39:11.465 --> 00:39:12.305]  One thousandth?
[00:39:12.305 --> 00:39:12.686]  I don't know.
[00:39:12.686 --> 00:39:15.267]  I mean, just much less dangerous.
[00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:16.628]  So here's how they do the argument.
[00:39:16.628 --> 00:39:19.429]  Jones believes there's no such thing as vaccines and that they don't work.
[00:39:19.429 --> 00:39:21.790]  He's a Christian scientist who believes in no medical care.
[00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:33.135]  That's why I've had surgery on my leg and surgery on my other arm and broken bones and stab wounds and why I had surgery for a hernia last year and, you know, why I go to the medical doctor whenever I need to.
[00:39:33.135 --> 00:39:34.536]  No, none of that's true.
[00:39:34.536 --> 00:39:40.399]  I'd have all my children with all the vaccines if they were tested and pure and there wasn't liability protection.
[00:39:41.159 --> 00:39:42.699]  I've read the literature.
[00:39:42.699 --> 00:39:44.240]  I know what it does.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.160]  I know it's a eugenics operation.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.221]  I know they've got the doctors and nurses all in on it.
[00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.442]  There's some good nurses.
[00:39:51.442 --> 00:40:03.764]  You know, we broke 20 years ago that every baby at birth, for now about 47 years, has blood taken and put in a UN database.
[00:40:03.764 --> 00:40:04.245]  We broke it.
[00:40:04.245 --> 00:40:06.265]  There were lawsuits in Texas and Minnesota.
[00:40:06.265 --> 00:40:07.645]  My listeners found out, sued.
[00:40:07.645 --> 00:40:09.666]  They won millions of dollars, and it's now admitted.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.422]  So see, that's what I did.
[00:40:12.422 --> 00:40:18.128]  A nurse told me about that from San Antonio that worked inside the Army.
[00:40:18.128 --> 00:40:28.139]  So, we've had whistleblowers on from the NICU units in the last five years they mandated, you never gave a premature baby vaccines you know can kill them.
[00:40:29.502 --> 00:40:32.446]  They mandated just to get away with it and see what they could do.
[00:40:32.446 --> 00:40:37.011]  If one nurse is injecting kids and they're dying, oh, it's a big, dangerous story.
[00:40:37.011 --> 00:40:42.057]  But they order the nurses, give all the preemies their shots, the bioethics board does.
[00:40:42.057 --> 00:40:45.381]  They get all the respirators ready, give them the shots.
[00:40:46.547 --> 00:40:49.750]  They start dying, and they put them on respirators.
[00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.592]  We've had the nurses on!
[00:40:51.592 --> 00:40:53.353]  We've had the nurses on!
[00:40:53.353 --> 00:40:55.015]  We've had the nurses on!
[00:40:55.015 --> 00:40:56.656]  We've had the nurses on!
[00:40:56.656 --> 00:40:57.677]  And it's been in the news.
[00:40:57.677 --> 00:41:02.582]  So, when you hear me talk about this type of stuff, understand, your life's in your hands.
[00:41:02.582 --> 00:41:03.523]  Okay?
[00:41:03.523 --> 00:41:05.685]  And the doctors know full well.
[00:41:05.685 --> 00:41:06.366]  Full well.
[00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:08.548]  But see, when you're 18 months old, here's the coup de grace.
[00:41:09.315 --> 00:41:10.716]  The final blow.
[00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:14.858]  Just like they told her if she took that shot a third time, it'd probably kill her.
[00:41:14.858 --> 00:41:16.899]  And she probably can't take vaccines ever again.
[00:41:16.899 --> 00:41:18.499]  They know babies can't complain.
[00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:19.520]  18-month-olds.
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.061]  Why do almost all of them 18 months go autistic?
[00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:23.502]  It's the third round.
[00:41:23.502 --> 00:41:26.623]  The third insult on average is the most deadly.
[00:41:26.623 --> 00:41:30.685]  And that's when, just like wasp stings you first time, you don't get sick.
[00:41:30.685 --> 00:41:31.585]  Second time, you kind of do.
[00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:33.146]  Third time, it might kill you.
[00:41:33.146 --> 00:41:34.006]  Same deal, folks.
[00:41:34.006 --> 00:41:34.767]  Autoimmune response.
[00:41:35.447 --> 00:41:41.589]  But they don't tell you have an EpiPen when you go in to get the vaccine, because they don't want to tell you there's any problem.
[00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:46.090]  Would you take your baby at birth and let 12 wasps come in and sting it?
[00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:48.931]  No, of course not.
[00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:55.973]  And that's much less deadly than a big old vaccine of hepatitis or MMR, triple jab, three different compounds.
[00:41:55.973 --> 00:42:00.014]  And they all know, every doctor I know, they don't give their children vaccines.
[00:42:00.014 --> 00:42:02.335]  They're in a cult giving it to you!
[00:42:05.657 --> 00:42:10.305]  So they told her, you take a third shot of this, it'll probably kill you!
[00:42:10.305 --> 00:42:11.648]  They're not gonna tell her mama.
[00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:19.889]  Even when they come in the second time and baby has a convulsion at a year old, when she comes back in six months later for their boosters.
[00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:21.390]  We're going to boost you.
[00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.451]  We're going to help you in life.
[00:42:22.451 --> 00:42:27.093]  No, we're going to reduce your IQ by 15 points and then we're going to reduce it with the fluoride as well.
[00:42:27.093 --> 00:42:30.835]  On average you'll have a 25, 30 point less lobotomy.
[00:42:30.835 --> 00:42:35.198]  Americans have been given lobotomies and the government declassified it.
[00:42:35.198 --> 00:42:36.999]  That's why we're so stupid.
[00:42:36.999 --> 00:42:37.940]  We were the best.
[00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:43.773]  We've been hit by chemical and biological weapons, and it's a total fact!
[00:42:43.773 --> 00:42:49.958]  And even good people at work here aren't sure I'm telling the truth till they almost die!
[00:42:49.958 --> 00:42:52.941]  Listen to me, or die!
[00:42:52.941 --> 00:42:58.645]  Listen to your common sense, or die!
[00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:05.251]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:43:05.251 --> 00:43:06.252]  You're a white man!

[00:43:47.866 --> 00:43:49.146]  This is The War Room.

[00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:17.093]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:45:17.093 --> 00:45:21.757]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:45:35.925 --> 00:45:42.949]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:47.292]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:59.683]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:59.683 --> 00:46:01.285]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:46:01.285 --> 00:46:03.867]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[00:46:03.867 --> 00:46:11.134]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable great tasting multivitamin formula available.

[00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:40.025]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:46:40.025 --> 00:46:42.086]  And this part is most important.

[00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:51.469]  That means it's pure.
[00:46:51.469 --> 00:46:54.350]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.151]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:46:57.151 --> 00:46:58.792]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:47:02.631 --> 00:47:21.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.108 --> 00:47:25.592]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:47:25.592 --> 00:47:26.994]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:34.074]  So they've introduced legislation to ban semi-automatic rifles, handguns, most guns.
[00:47:34.074 --> 00:47:39.617]  They've introduced legislation to ban the bump stocks, which had never been used in a crime that I know of until now.
[00:47:39.617 --> 00:47:41.739]  It's a total novelty.
[00:47:41.739 --> 00:47:48.983]  Less than 2% of actual crimes do the criminals use assault weapons, for whatever reason.
[00:47:48.983 --> 00:47:50.885]  It's usually shotguns and handguns.
[00:47:50.885 --> 00:47:51.485]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:47:51.485 --> 00:47:53.366]  They're projecting the idea that 59 dead
[00:47:54.923 --> 00:47:59.490]  That is just the most deadly thing in the entire history of the world.
[00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:05.981]  And it's terrible for those that got killed and terrible for those that got wounded, but hundreds die a day on the highways.
[00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:09.326]  Are they calling for a ban of cars every time Muslims run over people?
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:18.145]  Meanwhile, Somali refugee accused of Canadian truck attack last Sunday was ordered deported from the U.S.
[00:48:18.145 --> 00:48:21.427]  And now Canada and Mexico are saying, we're not taking these people.
[00:48:21.427 --> 00:48:27.031]  Mexico's saying they won't take the Mexicans we deport back because they say they're criminals.
[00:48:27.031 --> 00:48:28.052]  That was in the news last week.
[00:48:28.052 --> 00:48:30.493]  We're like, these people have a bunch of felonies.
[00:48:30.493 --> 00:48:31.654]  We don't want them.
[00:48:31.654 --> 00:48:32.515]  We don't want them either.
[00:48:34.744 --> 00:48:39.686]  It's like the Cuban deal was a brain drain of conservatives and Christians and business owners.
[00:48:39.686 --> 00:48:40.826]  They were good for the U.S.
[00:48:40.826 --> 00:48:41.606]  economy.
[00:48:41.606 --> 00:48:44.147]  We don't want the communist Cubans now.
[00:48:44.147 --> 00:48:45.108]  It's the same thing.
[00:48:45.108 --> 00:48:49.109]  It's like Mexico said last week.
[00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:50.550]  They said, we don't.
[00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.450]  We got big problems.
[00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:53.371]  These Mexicans you're sending back, we don't want.
[00:48:53.371 --> 00:48:54.111]  These are the bad ones.
[00:48:57.113 --> 00:49:01.335]  So again, they're saying, these Mexicans are criminals, don't send them here.
[00:49:01.335 --> 00:49:02.836]  There it is, Mexico to Trump.
[00:49:02.836 --> 00:49:07.217]  We won't take your unwanted immigrants, including Mexicans.
[00:49:07.217 --> 00:49:12.300]  And it's jumbling up our state systems and bankrupting us.
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.380]  In fact, that was the headline.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:16.622]  Mexico says they can't take Mexicans back, it's bankrupting them.
[00:49:16.622 --> 00:49:18.262]  Really?
[00:49:18.262 --> 00:49:19.563]  It's bankrupting you?
[00:49:21.527 --> 00:49:24.651]  Because we're not deporting back the productive people, folks.
[00:49:24.651 --> 00:49:27.514]  We're deporting the criminals, on average.
[00:49:27.514 --> 00:49:28.415]  Nothing's perfect.
[00:49:28.415 --> 00:49:30.157]  But if I go to Mexico illegally, they're going to deport me.
[00:49:30.157 --> 00:49:31.379]  But I'm digressing.
[00:49:31.379 --> 00:49:32.761]  Let me get back to Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:33.421]  This is a guy...
[00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:38.392]  Who has up to seven bodyguards, we've counted on video.
[00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.292]  He's got guys with glocks on.
[00:49:40.292 --> 00:49:43.193]  He's got armed security at his house.
[00:49:43.193 --> 00:49:44.853]  I know the neighborhood Kimmel lives in, by the way.
[00:49:44.853 --> 00:49:49.994]  I've been in the neighborhood before, and they've got armed response driving around, just like Piers Morgan has at his LA house.
[00:49:49.994 --> 00:49:56.496]  Armed response vans with guys driving around in air-conditioned vans with, you know, semi-auto rifles and shotguns.
[00:49:56.496 --> 00:49:58.396]  But he says you're to blame.
[00:49:58.396 --> 00:50:02.217]  So, Jimmy Kimmel's really saying, because guns exist, period,
[00:50:04.141 --> 00:50:04.805]  Then he's to blame!
[00:50:07.267 --> 00:50:18.415]  Because if somebody runs over somebody with a car, and Kimmel still owns a car, then by extension he's guilty because a weapon was used by somebody else, a baseball bat, a car, a butcher knife.
[00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:26.940]  If he has a baseball bat, a car, a butcher knife, a gun, then Jimmy Kimmel is guilty by extension, just like we all are.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:28.601]  This is so authoritarian.
[00:50:28.601 --> 00:50:31.223]  No, the crazy evil person's the problem.
[00:50:31.223 --> 00:50:34.766]  Like Congressman Scalise said, let's try to cue that up next, after Kimmel,
[00:50:35.646 --> 00:50:47.963]  And says he believes in guns more because if they wouldn't have had security there and guys that were armed to take out the shooter he would have gotten all 15 members of Congress in there and they could have had special elections and handed the Congress back to the Democrats.
[00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:59.709]  And even the Washington Times said it appeared to be a hit to take out the Republican insurrection of the Freedom Caucus that the Republican establishment and the Democrats want to stop.
[00:50:59.709 --> 00:51:00.790]  This is a war.
[00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:10.894]  You don't think Trump doesn't know they're harassing all his golf club members and all his hotel members and all his casino members and all his condo members?
[00:51:10.894 --> 00:51:13.395]  His people are being harassed to bankrupt him.
[00:51:13.395 --> 00:51:17.957]  And now this attack in Vegas is a cherry on top of we'll come and destroy your money.
[00:51:19.224 --> 00:51:23.267]  Because again, Trump wants a prosperity-based economy.
[00:51:23.267 --> 00:51:28.911]  The globalists want an economy that is based on austerity, centralization, and monopoly.
[00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:31.212]  And that's why Trump's such a center to them.
[00:51:31.212 --> 00:51:34.054]  But here is the ultimate hippie-crit.
[00:51:34.054 --> 00:51:34.955]  Hippie-crit.
[00:51:34.955 --> 00:51:36.276]  It's a new word I invented.
[00:51:36.276 --> 00:51:48.104]  Here is the hippie-crip, the Hollywood elitist, blaming everyone who has guns but himself when there's videos of him waving guns around saying, he's going to kill me with one.
[00:51:48.914 --> 00:51:50.815]  Irresponsible, but that's okay.
[00:51:50.815 --> 00:51:53.376]  Here is the Hippie Crit.
[00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:57.477]  Those watching from Las Vegas, you know what happened on Sunday night.
[00:51:57.477 --> 00:51:59.298]  I'm not going to get deep into it again tonight.
[00:51:59.298 --> 00:52:10.442]  I said what I had to say last night, but I do want to say something to these nuts who spent most of the day today on television, online, attacking those of us who think we need to do something about the fact that 59 innocent people were killed.
[00:52:10.442 --> 00:52:11.303]  No, you've been attacking us.
[00:52:11.303 --> 00:52:14.564]  They say it's inappropriate to be talking about it because it's
[00:52:14.844 --> 00:52:15.424]  Too soon.
[00:52:15.424 --> 00:52:25.168]  Well, maybe it's too soon for you, because deep down inside you know, in your heart, you know you bear some responsibility for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want.
[00:52:25.168 --> 00:52:28.709]  Now you want to cover yourself until the storm of outrage passes.
[00:52:28.709 --> 00:52:30.669]  You can go back to your dirty business as usual.
[00:52:30.669 --> 00:52:33.771]  But it's not too soon for us, because we're Americans.
[00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:38.372]  The last time I checked, the First Amendment is at least as important as the Second Amendment.
[00:52:38.372 --> 00:52:42.614]  So, we will talk about it.
[00:52:46.402 --> 00:52:56.148]  So he's acting like we're trying to stop his free speech when they're the ones trying to set up a ministry of truth to shut down conservative and libertarian talk radio, television, and internet.
[00:52:56.148 --> 00:53:00.791]  Naminginfowars.com and DrudgeReport.com is the first two.
[00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:11.158]  They want the Federal Election Commission to be shut down, run by their little buddy Chuckie Schumer, who admittedly puts the direct talking points into his head every show now.
[00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:19.753]  When he reads off that teleprompter with that studio audience queued for applause, he's reading what Chuckie Schumer sent him in an email.
[00:53:19.753 --> 00:53:22.554]  He admits that.
[00:53:22.554 --> 00:53:25.395]  So now you're not just a puppet, you're Chuckie Schumer's puppet.
[00:53:25.395 --> 00:53:26.335]  You're a hypocrite.
[00:53:26.335 --> 00:53:27.936]  You're a joke.
[00:53:27.936 --> 00:53:28.656]  Now here's Kimmel.
[00:53:32.054 --> 00:53:42.677]  Making fun of himself with guns, playing around with guns, something Hollywood does, something that they do, teaching people to act irresponsibly with firearms.
[00:53:42.677 --> 00:53:46.278]  So here he is, again, just another layer of fraud.
[00:53:46.278 --> 00:53:48.179]  Here it is.
[00:53:48.179 --> 00:53:52.620]  I've been reading comments from people saying this is terrible, but there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.941]  But I disagree with that intensely, because of course there's something we can do about it.
[00:53:56.941 --> 00:53:58.482]  There are a lot of things we can do about it.
[00:54:01.937 --> 00:54:06.205]  You're a killing machine.
[00:54:06.205 --> 00:54:07.768]  See you guys tomorrow.
[00:54:07.768 --> 00:54:08.749]  Have a good one.
[00:54:08.749 --> 00:54:09.731]  You nailed it.
[00:54:09.731 --> 00:54:11.034]  All five, right through the heart.
[00:54:11.034 --> 00:54:13.578]  The juice of these pickles is on you, Alex Jones.
[00:54:17.302 --> 00:54:22.710]  Onto a drone is a very bad idea, but it's also kind of awesome.
[00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:23.991]  Kill everyone in China?
[00:54:23.991 --> 00:54:24.412]  Yeah.
[00:54:24.412 --> 00:54:26.395]  Okay, that's an interesting idea.
[00:54:26.395 --> 00:54:30.180]  Then he fired at my head, and I fired a million shots at him.
[00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:30.440]  Okay!
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.223]  And I have pretty tight security around here.
[00:54:40.302 --> 00:54:46.787]  And to everyone affected by this terrible event, I'm sorry for getting emotional.
[00:54:46.787 --> 00:54:49.729]  I'm not great with this kind of thing.
[00:54:49.729 --> 00:55:01.377]  I believe that Abraham Lincoln had a vision about what the Republican Party would become in 150 years, and he shot himself.
[00:55:01.377 --> 00:55:07.021]  Jimmy Kimmel is the definition of a hypocrite, a fraud,
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.220]  A fop.
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.161]  He's not his own man.
[00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:19.926]  He is a puppet of his daddy.
[00:55:19.926 --> 00:55:21.187]  Chuckie Schumer.
[00:55:21.187 --> 00:55:22.028]  He is the mouth.
[00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:26.984]  Of Chuck Schumer telling us, give me your guns while he has all his bodyguards.
[00:55:26.984 --> 00:55:27.705]  Incredible.
[00:55:27.705 --> 00:55:35.431]  We're going to go to break and start the second hour and I intend to have wide open phones for people that were in Vegas, people that weren't, military, police, everybody free for all.
[00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:37.152]  I'm going to take a lot of your phone calls next hour.
[00:55:37.152 --> 00:55:37.212]  800-259-9231.
[00:55:37.212 --> 00:55:37.272]  800-259-9231.
[00:55:37.272 --> 00:55:38.833]  All I ask is you be first time callers.
[00:55:38.833 --> 00:55:39.474]  Let's enforce that rule.
[00:55:39.474 --> 00:55:39.534]  800-259-9231.
[00:55:39.534 --> 00:55:40.014]  You know what?
[00:55:40.014 --> 00:55:40.635]  They just reminded me.
[00:55:53.042 --> 00:55:57.304]  I'm totally running the whole show out of our Austin studios now, not the GCN studios.
[00:55:57.304 --> 00:56:00.685]  That changed over on Monday, another oversight of mine.
[00:56:00.685 --> 00:56:03.286]  And so we are, we've had several, my fault.
[00:56:03.286 --> 00:56:07.608]  We're going to have our new number, that we've used on Sunday for a long time, that will be the number we use, 877-789-2539, 877-789, Alex!
[00:56:07.608 --> 00:56:08.408]  That is the number, 877-789-2539.
[00:56:16.687 --> 00:56:19.409]  We're going to start the next hour here in a moment.
[00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.030]  But first, support the broadcast.
[00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.511]  Thank you all for your support.

[00:56:37.864 --> 00:56:40.588]  It is 50% off the regular price.
[00:56:40.588 --> 00:56:44.393]  We've never gone that low, but I got a big shipment in and I want you to try it.
[00:56:44.393 --> 00:56:50.541]  It's a great brain pill, very healthy, using all natural compounds, totally organic, highest standards.

[00:56:56.948 --> 00:56:59.311]  If you'd like to order over the phone, talk about other specials.
[00:56:59.311 --> 00:57:00.472]  We have to end the specials.
[00:57:00.472 --> 00:57:03.035]  We just ended the specials on Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:57:03.035 --> 00:57:04.817]  We've got to end the specials soon.
[00:57:04.817 --> 00:57:06.438]  I guess this week.
[00:57:06.438 --> 00:57:12.084]  Just the next few days on the Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Formula with
[00:57:12.805 --> 00:57:16.990]  Chaga mushroom, turmeric, alfalfa, and so much more.

[00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:24.940]  Infowarslife.com, that special is about to end.

[01:00:08.419 --> 01:00:10.300]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:10.880]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:11.240]  Central.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:11.880]  We're here live.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.501]  Don't forget David Knight.
[01:00:13.501 --> 01:00:15.822]  And the real news is on 8 a.m.
[01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:16.562]  to 11 a.m.
[01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:18.943]  But I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.943 --> 01:00:19.483]  11 a.m.
[01:00:19.483 --> 01:00:20.323]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:20.323 --> 01:00:20.683]  Central.
[01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.684]  And this is the Info War.
[01:00:22.684 --> 01:00:27.946]  Owen Schroyer, syndicated radio slash TV, comes on as well.
[01:00:27.946 --> 01:00:29.106]  Weekdays at 3 p.m.
[01:00:29.106 --> 01:00:31.107]  Central, right after this transmission ends.
[01:00:32.469 --> 01:00:33.729]  I've opened the phone lines up.
[01:00:33.729 --> 01:00:38.850]  We're now fully producing the show right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.831]  And we're doing that because it's easier to do.
[01:00:41.831 --> 01:00:42.871]  Everything's here.
[01:00:42.871 --> 01:00:43.971]  It's more redundant.
[01:00:43.971 --> 01:00:48.092]  But I do have GCN as a backup on satellite.
[01:00:48.092 --> 01:00:51.873]  And it's good to have those guys there as well.
[01:00:51.873 --> 01:00:54.934]  So much so I forgot and gave out their number.
[01:00:55.794 --> 01:00:58.395]  Like I forgot some other things this week.
[01:00:58.395 --> 01:01:04.457]  But we now have the number I've been using for the Sunday Show for hard to believe almost 10 years.
[01:01:04.457 --> 01:01:09.099]  I've been doing the Sunday Show.
[01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:11.840]  877-789-2539 is the new number to call us live on air.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:16.761]  And we've got 40 phone lines on that system, so it is a little bit better than GCM with five phone lines.
[01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:16.801]  877-789-2539.
[01:01:21.663 --> 01:01:33.868]  877-789-ALEX and we will get you up and on the air on Vegas specifically and the attack on the Second Amendment.
[01:01:33.868 --> 01:01:41.191]  I'd like it to be first-time callers to give folks a chance to get into the show who haven't been able to get on the broadcast before.
[01:01:41.191 --> 01:01:43.592]  So that is coming up.
[01:01:43.592 --> 01:01:48.914]  Also, donors of the anti-Trump resistance group revealed
[01:01:50.009 --> 01:01:55.750]  It's a big story that's, well, all over the news.
[01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:59.171]  Washington Free Beacon, Zero Hedge, and others.
[01:01:59.171 --> 01:02:04.752]  Soros, Kellogg, Ford, donor list of anti-Trump resistance group, revealed.
[01:02:04.752 --> 01:02:13.654]  Again, they call themselves the resistance, because they know you're the resistance, I'm the resistance, and they're a bunch of plagiarists, they're a bunch of frauds, they're a bunch of counterfeiters.
[01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:16.071]  They know we're kicking their butt.
[01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:17.431]  We've got a beachhead in Washington.
[01:02:17.431 --> 01:02:18.072]  It isn't perfect.
[01:02:18.072 --> 01:02:19.292]  It's ragtag.
[01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:20.113]  It's a train wreck.
[01:02:20.113 --> 01:02:25.836]  But culturally, we're promoting Americana and they know they can't beat that.
[01:02:25.836 --> 01:02:30.659]  So they are panicking right now, big time.
[01:02:30.659 --> 01:02:33.740]  And that's an interesting article I'm going to be going over, I promise.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.421]  It's begun.
[01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:38.503]  Mother jailed for refusing to vaccinate her son.
[01:02:38.503 --> 01:02:39.223]  Up in Michigan.
[01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:40.344]  I really like Michigan, but man.
[01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:44.187]  Talk about a nanny state there in the collapsing cities.
[01:02:44.187 --> 01:02:47.910]  They are really pushing it, and that's a very, very dangerous precedent.
[01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.451]  So we're going to break that down.
[01:02:50.451 --> 01:02:57.637]  Also, Trump tells the Senate Intel Committee it should investigate fake news media, not the supposed fake news the Russians are funding.
[01:02:57.637 --> 01:03:04.121]  The Senate Committee came out yesterday and said, we'll keep investigating Russia, but so far we've found nothing.
[01:03:04.121 --> 01:03:07.023]  Not even a shred.
[01:03:07.023 --> 01:03:09.285]  No Russia involvement in the election.
[01:03:10.657 --> 01:03:21.161]  But they claim some Russian company bought some ads in a couple states on Facebook talking about Ferguson.
[01:03:21.161 --> 01:03:24.643]  Well, of course there's going to be foreign think tanks and groups.
[01:03:24.643 --> 01:03:34.407]  Our government spent tens of billions of dollars a year, that's public, trying to overthrow the Russian government inside Russia, and Russia only banned it last year.
[01:03:34.407 --> 01:03:38.289]  And then they have people on Fox News and CNN going,
[01:03:39.164 --> 01:03:43.205]  We just can't believe the Russians tried to get involved in the election by buying ads.
[01:03:43.205 --> 01:03:44.785]  It's just unprecedented.
[01:03:44.785 --> 01:03:46.605]  It's an act of war.
[01:03:46.605 --> 01:03:58.688]  No, an act of war is having George Soros try to overthrow every country on their border, and actively have Georgia start a war in 2008, and actively try to overthrow the Moscow government that's elected.
[01:03:58.688 --> 01:04:05.629]  I mean, they admit that in C-SPAN hearings, that they spent $5 billion overthrowing Ukraine.
[01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:08.051]  And an elected government.
[01:04:08.051 --> 01:04:16.275]  I mean, they are just in Russia's face, just punching Russia in the nose and then going, I can't believe you're trying to restrain my fist from smashing into you.
[01:04:16.275 --> 01:04:18.296]  You're abusing my fist.
[01:04:18.296 --> 01:04:24.579]  We're hitting you in the face and you're trying to stop us and just putting your hand up and blocking it.
[01:04:24.579 --> 01:04:25.900]  Why are you attacking my fist?
[01:04:26.843 --> 01:04:28.765]  Oh, I just broke my headset again.
[01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:32.368]  You know, I really shouldn't bang the table like that.
[01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:36.371]  I do it hard enough, it always shorts out the situation.
[01:04:36.371 --> 01:04:44.078]  We're gonna come back after this break, maybe do a long intro, to see if I can try to get hooked back up here on the other side.
[01:04:44.078 --> 01:04:46.720]  Help me, Houston, I've lost audio!
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.922]  I've lost my teleprompter like I'm a politician.
[01:04:48.922 --> 01:04:50.543]  I can't talk without my earpiece!
[01:04:50.543 --> 01:04:52.345]  They're telling me what to say in my earpiece!
[01:04:52.345 --> 01:04:54.086]  That's called satire, folks.
[01:04:54.086 --> 01:04:54.987]  They don't tell me what to say.

[01:06:06.249 --> 01:06:23.245]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:27.669]  Okay, in this second hour of the worldwide broadcast today, we're going to talk everything Vegas.
[01:06:28.871 --> 01:06:33.074]  What happens in Vegas doesn't stay in Vegas.
[01:06:33.074 --> 01:06:40.959]  You've got that tomb out in the desert, that's what I privately call it when I've been there, is a giant tomb of the soulless.
[01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:44.361]  And I understand it's the only place you can go to see George Strait.
[01:06:44.361 --> 01:06:44.861]  I understand that.
[01:06:44.861 --> 01:06:46.742]  It's the only place you can go to see Motley Crue.
[01:06:46.742 --> 01:06:51.966]  I mean, those are just examples of all these huge, incredible country music groups, hip-hop groups,
[01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:59.808]  You name it, rock and roll groups, they retire, but then they do shows in Vegas, just like Elvis used to do.
[01:06:59.808 --> 01:07:02.590]  He started that, or I guess Frank Sinatra.
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:07.154]  So I could see if Frank Sinatra was still alive, or Johnny Cash, and they only played in Vegas, going to Vegas.
[01:07:07.154 --> 01:07:10.136]  But I just don't like the gambling.
[01:07:10.136 --> 01:07:12.998]  I don't like all the soullessness that goes on.
[01:07:12.998 --> 01:07:16.581]  It's not that I'm some square who can't handle it.
[01:07:16.581 --> 01:07:21.625]  I pick up on the emptiness, the desperation, the soullessness.
[01:07:22.922 --> 01:07:46.218]  And it's just very archetypal to see all those beautiful people, all those beautiful souls, gulping like fish out of water, fading out like a setting sun as blood comes out of their mouths, lying in piles of beer cans and Starbucks cups and potato chip packages and hot dog, half-eaten hot dogs.
[01:07:46.218 --> 01:07:52.302]  I mean, I was transfixed in a nightmare watching the videos people shot while they were
[01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:53.623]  We're good to go.
[01:08:13.211 --> 01:08:30.401]  Well, if you didn't have all the gun grabbers with their own guns and their own security guards and promoting violence through Hollywood, and even Jimmy Kimmel saying, I'll kill you, Alex Jones, and pointing a gun at me and saying, this is a message, and pulling the trigger, shut up about Hillary Clinton.
[01:08:30.401 --> 01:08:33.683]  Imagine if I did that with a gun and said, it's a message to you, Kimmel.
[01:08:33.683 --> 01:08:36.725]  I mean, it'd be, Jones threatens Kimmel!
[01:08:36.725 --> 01:08:39.987]  But Kimmel comes out with this forced crying.
[01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:51.957]  He walks on stage, his eyes are already watering, you can tell he's put some type of pepper in him, and then the fake crying begins.
[01:08:51.957 --> 01:09:00.360]  And he admits, he gets scripts from Chuckie Schumer every day, it's loaded in the teleprompter, and he even admits it!
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.882]  You want to kill my son if you don't let him have Obamacare, it's written by big banks to screw you!
[01:09:04.882 --> 01:09:07.403]  I'm the worst actor on earth!
[01:09:07.403 --> 01:09:10.525]  And then if you don't agree with it, oh you hate his son, you want to kill his son.
[01:09:12.608 --> 01:09:14.129]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:09:14.129 --> 01:09:17.893]  And now, oh, you're trying to violate my First Amendment.
[01:09:17.893 --> 01:09:23.157]  No, when you come out and say ban guns, you come out and jump on it.
[01:09:23.157 --> 01:09:27.481]  Day one, like Hillary, we're saying, you know, you really shouldn't be exploiting this day one that we know more.
[01:09:28.339 --> 01:09:30.020]  That doesn't mean you don't have free speech.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:37.046]  My free speech is I can criticize you, but they always spin that, oh, you're trying to suppress my free speech, when they're the ones with the new Ministry of Truth.
[01:09:37.046 --> 01:09:41.309]  They're the ones wanting the Federal Election Commission to ban InfoWars and Drudge Report.
[01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:42.750]  I mean, that's public.
[01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:46.873]  Now, that's off the table now, for now.
[01:09:46.873 --> 01:09:50.977]  But they're the ones saying ban hate speech, ban the free speech of the right wing.
[01:09:50.977 --> 01:09:52.698]  They're the ones saying we're all white supremacists.
[01:09:52.698 --> 01:09:55.120]  They're the bullies.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.341]  He's the one with all the bodyguards.
[01:09:58.243 --> 01:10:00.026]  And then all of the usual suspects.
[01:10:00.026 --> 01:10:09.581]  I've got a bunch of these clips but here it is one more time before I go to your phone calls because this illustrates the total hypocrisy and again the fake crying all of it here it is.
[01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.983]  Las Vegas where you know what happened on Sunday night.
[01:10:14.983 --> 01:10:16.805]  I'm not going to get deep into it again tonight.
[01:10:16.805 --> 01:10:28.616]  I said what I had to say last night, but I do want to say something to these nuts who spent most of the day today on television online attacking those of us who think we need to do something about the fact that 59 innocent people were killed.
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:37.230]  Let me decipher that from the office of Chuck Schumer, literally written in an email or in phone calls.
[01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:38.893]  This is admitted to him.
[01:10:38.893 --> 01:10:40.696]  He's very proud that he talks to Schumer daily.
[01:10:40.696 --> 01:10:41.698]  He tells him what to say.
[01:10:41.698 --> 01:10:42.540]  That's his words.
[01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:43.662]  Schumer tells me what to say.
[01:10:45.384 --> 01:10:58.514]  What he's saying is, we're the ruling class, we want you disarmed, we've all got bodyguards and guns, and brag about it in other videos we're about to show you, but you the prole, you the slave, you the underclass, you don't get to have that like in Chicago, New York, or D.C.
[01:10:58.514 --> 01:11:13.246]  We're going to feed on you, and we the criminal class are going to control you, and when we come out and cry and say, you're to blame and we want your guns, and then you respond by saying, no, here's the statistics, don't take our rights, oh, then you turn it around that we've taken your right.
[01:11:14.059 --> 01:11:22.000]  This is lies upon twisting, upon to spin, upon deception, and then all over again.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.661]  So now he acts like he's defending the Second Amendment by the First Amendment.
[01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:34.082]  He's now the defender of the rights when he's trying to take the right away, and the group he represents wants to take all our free speech.
[01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.883]  This is a danger!
[01:11:35.883 --> 01:11:42.664]  This puppet, this teleprompter reader, this isn't Kimmel, but the mouth, this facsimile,
[01:11:43.888 --> 01:11:48.553]  It's like you had a cutout of Kimmel, and then in between it, you got Soros like this.
[01:11:48.553 --> 01:11:49.974]  It looks like Kimmel, but it's Soros.
[01:11:49.974 --> 01:11:50.535]  Oh yeah!
[01:11:50.535 --> 01:11:51.356]  Take the guns!
[01:11:51.356 --> 01:11:52.517]  And they don't like First Amendment either!
[01:11:52.517 --> 01:11:53.698]  They're the ones that are against the rights!
[01:11:53.698 --> 01:11:54.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.823]  Give me a close shot on four.
[01:11:58.598 --> 01:11:59.618]  Hi!
[01:11:59.618 --> 01:12:01.599]  Oh, this is Chuckie Schumer.
[01:12:01.599 --> 01:12:03.719]  Oh, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.259]  I'm Jimmy Kimmel.
[01:12:05.259 --> 01:12:05.679]  Hi!
[01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:10.580]  You know, we're not elitists and have our own guns and bodyguards, but we do.
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:20.362]  You can't have yours, and if you disagree with me, you're trying to take my First Amendment, even though I'm the one taking your Second Amendment, and apparently wanting to get rid of the First.
[01:12:20.362 --> 01:12:21.982]  So let's hear from Chuckie Schumer.
[01:12:21.982 --> 01:12:23.382]  In fact, start Chuckie Schumer over.
[01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:26.403]  In fact, from now on, he's... How do you combine
[01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:30.849]  Kimmel and Schumer.
[01:12:30.849 --> 01:12:33.491]  I mean, I guess it's Chuck, Jimmy Kimmel, Schumer.
[01:12:33.491 --> 01:12:34.231]  That's it.
[01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:39.855]  So he will now henceforth be known as Chuck, Jimmy, Kimmel, Schumer.
[01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:43.757]  What do you call it when you combine Brad Pitt and Angeline Jolie?
[01:12:43.757 --> 01:12:45.899]  They have a name?
[01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:46.779]  But that's not good enough here.
[01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:50.942]  It's just Chuck, Jimmy, Kimmel, Schumer.
[01:12:50.942 --> 01:12:54.264]  So let's hear from the literal puppet.
[01:12:54.264 --> 01:12:54.625]  Here it is.
[01:12:57.344 --> 01:12:59.985]  Las Vegas, where you know what happened on Sunday night.
[01:12:59.985 --> 01:13:01.786]  I'm not going to get deep into it again tonight.
[01:13:01.786 --> 01:13:04.266]  I said what I had to say last night, but I do want to say something.
[01:13:04.266 --> 01:13:05.107]  By the way, stop again.
[01:13:05.107 --> 01:13:05.987]  That's another lie.
[01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:09.448]  He knows you're tuning out, like the NFL, tuning out for political correctness.
[01:13:09.448 --> 01:13:10.268]  He knows.
[01:13:10.268 --> 01:13:12.189]  So he's lying to you because they did it throughout the show.
[01:13:12.189 --> 01:13:13.269]  So he's like, don't leave.
[01:13:13.269 --> 01:13:13.950]  Stay.
[01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:14.470]  Stay.
[01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:15.450]  Stay.
[01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:16.591]  I'm not being political.
[01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:17.831]  I'm not beating you over the head.
[01:13:17.831 --> 01:13:19.311]  See, it's all lies.
[01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:20.212]  It's pure lies.
[01:13:20.212 --> 01:13:20.772]  Start it over.
[01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:25.460]  Las Vegas, where you know what happened on Sunday night.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:27.281]  I'm not going to get deep into it again tonight.
[01:13:27.281 --> 01:13:38.167]  I said what I had to say last night, but I do want to say something to these nuts who spent most of the day today on television, online, attacking those of us who think we need to do something about the fact that 59... He just attacked you.
[01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:38.927]  He just called you a nut.
[01:13:39.267 --> 01:13:43.410]  They say it's inappropriate to be talking about it because it's too soon.
[01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:55.019]  Well, maybe it's too soon for you because deep down inside, you know, in your heart, you know you bear some responsibility for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want.
[01:13:55.019 --> 01:13:56.100]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.641]  No, I don't feel guilt.
[01:13:57.641 --> 01:13:58.862]  I feel pride.
[01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:08.544]  ...and responsibility, and that America is one of the freest countries in the world, like Switzerland, and that we have a Second Amendment to protect ourselves from corrupt elites like you.
[01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:25.794]  And I'm proud I have a platform to stand up against a vicious, evil, sell-out, mercenary, dirtbag, anti-American piece of garbage like you, Kimmel, who would have the nerve to read off a teleprompter and tell me that I'm responsible for these dead people and these wounded people.
[01:14:26.314 --> 01:14:31.362]  You are the biggest guilt-trippin' piece of garbage I've ever seen, Chuckie Schumer.
[01:14:31.362 --> 01:14:33.505]  Chuck Kimmel Schumer.
[01:14:33.505 --> 01:14:34.006]  Back to ya!
[01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:44.082]  For you, because deep down inside, you know, in your heart, you know you bear some responsibility for the fact that almost anyone can get any weapon they want.
[01:14:44.082 --> 01:14:49.307]  Now you want to cover yourself until the storm of outrage passes.
[01:14:49.307 --> 01:14:51.509]  No, we don't cover ourselves from storms of outrage.
[01:14:51.509 --> 01:14:54.191]  We go into those storms to tell the truth honorably.
[01:14:54.191 --> 01:14:55.632]  We don't care about the crowd.
[01:14:55.632 --> 01:14:57.093]  We don't care about intimidation.
[01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.816]  We don't care about brainwashing because we're leaders.
[01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:03.570]  We're like the North Star.
[01:15:03.570 --> 01:15:05.111]  We stand for something.
[01:15:05.111 --> 01:15:06.772]  And that's our integrity, Kemmel.
[01:15:06.772 --> 01:15:08.373]  We don't read off teleprompters.
[01:15:08.373 --> 01:15:10.815]  We're our own men, Kemmel.
[01:15:10.815 --> 01:15:12.596]  Back to Kemmel.
[01:15:12.596 --> 01:15:15.598]  Cover yourself until the storm of outrage passes.
[01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:19.460]  You can go back to your dirty business as usual, but it's not just you.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.822]  Oh, we're in dirty businesses!
[01:15:22.822 --> 01:15:29.787]  Just like they've had Oberman come out and say, gun owners are terrorists, period.
[01:15:29.787 --> 01:15:30.487]  And what do you do to them?
[01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:31.128]  You lock them up.
[01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:35.498]  Oh, but Jimmy Kimmel as a gun owner, he's not a terrorist.
[01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:36.259]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:15:36.259 --> 01:15:37.759]  It's like pigs and animal farm.
[01:15:37.759 --> 01:15:39.340]  They can walk on two legs.
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.362]  Two legs bad, four legs good.
[01:15:42.362 --> 01:15:45.643]  Except when they're on two legs, then it's two legs is okay, right?
[01:15:45.643 --> 01:15:45.983]  Right?
[01:15:45.983 --> 01:15:47.364]  You think you've killed logic.
[01:15:47.364 --> 01:15:48.885]  You think you've lowered our IQ.
[01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:50.045]  You think you've won.
[01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:53.087]  There's still enough of us that know who you are, enemy!
[01:15:56.877 --> 01:16:07.463]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:09.524]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:12.405]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:16:12.405 --> 01:16:13.886]  It's made in the USA.
[01:16:13.886 --> 01:16:17.028]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[01:16:17.248 --> 01:16:20.711]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:22.792]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:32.500]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:44.909]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[01:16:45.009 --> 01:16:46.590]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:48.672]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:49.413]  Why we have them.
[01:16:49.413 --> 01:16:52.295]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[01:16:52.295 --> 01:16:58.181]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[01:17:11.112 --> 01:17:18.154]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[01:17:18.154 --> 01:17:28.896]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[01:17:28.896 --> 01:17:32.537]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[01:17:34.437 --> 01:17:41.599]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[01:17:41.599 --> 01:17:44.240]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.101]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[01:17:47.101 --> 01:17:53.683]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[01:17:53.683 --> 01:17:56.204]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[01:17:57.659 --> 01:17:58.179]  Not a group.
[01:17:58.179 --> 01:17:59.620]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:00.920]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.140]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:07.422]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:07.422 --> 01:18:20.966]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:20.966 --> 01:18:22.327]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:23.107 --> 01:18:24.748]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:24.748 --> 01:18:27.328]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:28.629]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:29.729]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:29.729 --> 01:18:31.069]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:31.069 --> 01:18:35.571]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:35.571 --> 01:18:38.832]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:18:38.832 --> 01:18:41.933]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:41.933 --> 01:18:42.973]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:18:42.973 --> 01:18:43.793]  Living Defense.
[01:18:43.793 --> 01:18:44.894]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:44.894 --> 01:18:45.914]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:18:45.914 --> 01:18:46.674]  It's full of stuff.
[01:18:46.674 --> 01:18:48.635]  It's great for your body, period.
[01:18:48.635 --> 01:18:48.835]  And, uh,
[01:18:49.395 --> 01:18:50.536]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:18:50.536 --> 01:18:51.877]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:18:51.877 --> 01:18:54.139]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:18:54.139 --> 01:18:57.322]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:18:57.322 --> 01:19:06.049]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:19:06.049 --> 01:19:06.589]  That's right.
[01:19:06.589 --> 01:19:11.854]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[01:19:11.854 --> 01:19:18.279]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:19:18.499 --> 01:19:26.106]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:19:26.106 --> 01:19:26.346]  Woo!
[01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:27.387]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:19:27.387 --> 01:19:36.135]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:19:36.135 --> 01:19:44.182]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:19:45.703 --> 01:19:49.146]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:19:49.146 --> 01:19:53.270]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:54.331]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:19:54.331 --> 01:20:00.137]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:00.137 --> 01:20:02.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.174 --> 01:20:29.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:33.965]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:43.217 --> 01:20:50.760]  You know, I've said a lot of really mean things about Jimmy Kimmel, even after he did the whole joke piece about how he wanted to kill me.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:54.782]  I was good-humored about it because I'm a good-humored person.
[01:20:54.782 --> 01:21:02.426]  But he's now saying that gun owners are dirty, bad people, and that we're responsible for those murders in Vegas.
[01:21:02.426 --> 01:21:05.707]  That is an incredibly dangerous precedent.
[01:21:05.707 --> 01:21:09.609]  That's like saying if a jihadi runs over a couple hundred people in Nice,
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.361]  And how many people that kill like 80 something?
[01:21:14.361 --> 01:21:20.823]  That somehow people that drive delivery trucks are in a dirty business and somehow they're guilty.
[01:21:20.823 --> 01:21:28.625]  Or if somebody stabs somebody to death with a butcher knife, that we're guilty.
[01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:31.946]  That is so fraudulent.
[01:21:31.946 --> 01:21:34.946]  And I reject it.
[01:21:34.946 --> 01:21:40.188]  And I reject Chuckie Schumer that is the brain of Kimmel.
[01:21:41.052 --> 01:21:45.135]  But all the shows have gone political because they're losing control.
[01:21:45.135 --> 01:21:47.477]  And they know it's hurting their ratings, but they don't care.
[01:21:47.477 --> 01:21:52.240]  They know it drove CNN and MSNBC into the ground.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.142]  And they know it's driving HBO into the ground.
[01:21:54.142 --> 01:22:05.090]  And they know they're getting one-star votes on Netflix and all the other platforms, but they just removed the stars off of those particular programs, so you can't vote.
[01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:07.152]  Because they're going to force-feed you.
[01:22:07.152 --> 01:22:08.493]  And that's what Jimmy Kimmel should know.
[01:22:09.605 --> 01:22:13.247]  Megan Kelly was the second most popular person on Fox News.
[01:22:13.247 --> 01:22:15.088]  Sometimes the most popular.
[01:22:15.088 --> 01:22:22.513]  She went from being a mild conservative to being her true globalist, liberal, control freak personage.
[01:22:22.513 --> 01:22:24.835]  And Donald Trump crippled her.
[01:22:25.993 --> 01:22:42.322]  And even though she tried to destroy me, just the fact that she set herself up against the populist movement, even though the interview made me look like hell, everyone rejected her in the process and her ratings went down 70%.
[01:22:42.322 --> 01:22:45.844]  And now her new show is floundering.
[01:22:45.844 --> 01:22:47.325]  And even mainstream media admits.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.721]  That Donald Trump and Alex Jones killed Megyn Kelly's career.
[01:22:54.721 --> 01:22:58.062]  But that's not really even accurate.
[01:22:58.062 --> 01:23:02.002]  She killed her own career.
[01:23:02.002 --> 01:23:06.743]  And the people that put her in that position knew what they were doing.
[01:23:06.743 --> 01:23:09.744]  If it worked, if she was successful, then good.
[01:23:09.744 --> 01:23:16.525]  But they knew, five to one, that it'd be over for her.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:29.708]  But she was so narcissistic, she had no idea she was walking in front of a political firing squad.
[01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:34.691]  And Tom Brokaw, I've got clips of him with Megyn Kelly running around demonizing all gun owners.
[01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:36.652]  I'm gonna play that clip coming up.
[01:23:36.652 --> 01:23:39.234]  It's sickening to have these criminals
[01:23:40.734 --> 01:23:51.901]  And in my view, they're criminals, working for the big corporate media, getting taxpayer money through the subsidiaries, through the stimulus programs, trying to steal our basic civil rights.
[01:23:51.901 --> 01:23:54.583]  You try to violate somebody's First Amendment, it's racketeering.
[01:23:54.583 --> 01:23:56.704]  You try to take somebody's Second Amendment, it's racketeering.
[01:23:56.704 --> 01:24:00.767]  You break into somebody's house, try to surveil them without a warrant, you violated the Fourth, it's criminal.
[01:24:02.526 --> 01:24:17.017]  And it is a civil rights violation what this big combine of bullies getting together trying to intimidate us and peck at us and name-call us and censor us and boycott us until we give in to them.
[01:24:17.017 --> 01:24:20.200]  Well, I think they've noticed that the American people are finally awake.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.382]  They took the fact we were sleeping that we were playing.
[01:24:23.382 --> 01:24:26.184]  Now we're awake?
[01:24:26.184 --> 01:24:31.268]  And they're going, oh my gosh, we're dealing with a world champion donkey.
[01:24:31.268 --> 01:24:32.229]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:34.025 --> 01:24:40.872]  The American spirit is like that of a jackass, and that's why the Democrats used to have that as their logo.
[01:24:40.872 --> 01:24:47.539]  They're a totally different party than they were in Thomas Jefferson's day, and then by the Civil War, the whole donkey thing appeared, meaning they were stubborn.
[01:24:47.539 --> 01:24:54.786]  It was seen as a stubborn, hard-nosed, smart animal that wasn't going to be pushed around.
[01:24:54.786 --> 01:24:57.769]  And now they're realizing that the American people
[01:25:00.643 --> 01:25:02.504]  Or like a cross between a donkey and an elephant.
[01:25:02.504 --> 01:25:12.810]  Big, and strong, and dedicated, and slow to anger, like an elephant, but once you get one mad, look out!
[01:25:12.810 --> 01:25:18.393]  So see, all the symbols of what America is, they've stolen, and we're taking those symbols back.
[01:25:18.393 --> 01:25:20.775]  Like, I'm thinking about making my symbol be a jackass.
[01:25:22.401 --> 01:25:25.823]  Because you're not going to make me do anything I don't want to do.
[01:25:25.823 --> 01:25:29.866]  And the more you bully me and the more you attack me, the more I'm going to attack back.
[01:25:29.866 --> 01:25:32.107]  Oh, and watch what's happening.
[01:25:32.107 --> 01:25:36.350]  I'm basing what I do in Americana and truth and justice and freedom.
[01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:37.911]  You're basing all your garbage and fraud.
[01:25:40.049 --> 01:25:41.390]  And so what's happening to you?
[01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:44.853]  You're losing support, you're getting weaker, we're getting stronger.
[01:25:44.853 --> 01:25:47.635]  And InfoWars is just one focal point, one manifestation.
[01:25:47.635 --> 01:25:56.742]  There's so many new great minds popping up of every color, of every creed, all part of the human race, that you're in full panic mode.
[01:25:56.742 --> 01:26:01.666]  We're going to go to Zach, Chris, Jeff, Patricia, Paul, Jesse, Kim, and others.
[01:26:01.666 --> 01:26:03.468]  On the other side of the break, I'm going right to you.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.843]  But before I do that, I want to get the plugs out of the way.
[01:26:07.843 --> 01:26:17.990]  If you don't support this broadcast by sharing the articles, the videos, the stories, we won't get around the censors, we won't get around the bots, we won't get around the Facebooks, the Twitters, and the Googles.
[01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:25.596]  But you've been doing that, so our average video on Facebook and YouTube doesn't just have 30, 40,000 views.
[01:26:25.596 --> 01:26:29.599]  Now they're back to their 250,000 million, 2 million, 5 million.
[01:26:29.599 --> 01:26:32.862]  And we always have videos every week that get millions of views, sometimes tens of millions.
[01:26:34.529 --> 01:26:36.751]  We are exploding past all the censors.
[01:26:36.751 --> 01:26:40.833]  They've even got news articles out today saying, look, Jones is putting out fake news.
[01:26:40.833 --> 01:26:41.333]  Ban him.
[01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:42.534]  Don't let him be on Facebook.
[01:26:42.534 --> 01:26:43.795]  What are you doing?
[01:26:43.795 --> 01:26:46.156]  He gets hundreds of thousands of views every few minutes.
[01:26:46.156 --> 01:26:49.178]  Because they're actually watching it in horror.
[01:26:49.178 --> 01:26:50.999]  All these new viewers.
[01:26:50.999 --> 01:26:54.802]  The fake news that the shooter didn't act alone.
[01:26:54.802 --> 01:26:56.723]  The fake news that he was being radicalized.
[01:26:56.723 --> 01:26:59.965]  All of it confirmed by the Sheriff's Department.
[01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:01.146]  The fake news that he was on
[01:27:02.461 --> 01:27:04.062]  Anti-psychotics, all confirmed.
[01:27:04.062 --> 01:27:08.504]  The fake news that he had an intelligence agency cut out, all confirmed.
[01:27:08.504 --> 01:27:15.487]  The fake news there was a woman in the hotel with him days before and he was there for five days, not three, now all confirmed.
[01:27:15.487 --> 01:27:16.347]  All confirmed.
[01:27:16.347 --> 01:27:17.188]  All confirmed.
[01:27:17.188 --> 01:27:18.028]  All confirmed.
[01:27:18.028 --> 01:27:18.848]  All confirmed.
[01:27:18.848 --> 01:27:19.869]  All confirmed.
[01:27:19.869 --> 01:27:21.569]  And a whole bunch more about to get confirmed.
[01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:22.150]  Confirmed.
[01:27:22.150 --> 01:27:22.550]  Confirmed.
[01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.930]  Confirmed.
[01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:23.630]  Confirmed.
[01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:26.692]  Oh, we've got all the contacts flooding in.
[01:27:26.692 --> 01:27:29.253]  Vetting it all is the problem.
[01:27:29.253 --> 01:27:31.394]  It's like, you know, a hundred people trying to eat an elephant.
[01:27:32.338 --> 01:27:35.661]  It's a lot of intel to go over, but we're doing it.
[01:27:35.661 --> 01:27:40.826]  And as our credibility rises, we just get more and more plum information.
[01:27:40.826 --> 01:27:42.808]  But excuse me, back to the plugging.
[01:27:42.808 --> 01:27:43.869]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:27:43.869 --> 01:27:44.729]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:27:44.729 --> 01:27:45.890]  You're the reason we're winning.
[01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:52.136]  And we have the great brain nootropic, brain booster, brain force,
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:57.226]  Sold out for a long time, and I said double our order, and double came in.
[01:27:57.226 --> 01:27:59.209]  And I'm dropping it to 50% off.
[01:27:59.209 --> 01:28:01.272]  You get the auto ship.
[01:28:01.272 --> 01:28:02.614]  It's a lost leader.
[01:28:02.614 --> 01:28:03.695]  We've never had it this low.
[01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:04.697]  Not because it's not popular.
[01:28:04.697 --> 01:28:06.600]  It's so popular, I want more people to get it!
[01:28:07.973 --> 01:28:11.296]  And as I lower prices down to almost cost, it's exponential.

[01:28:28.499 --> 01:28:29.459]  Or it sells out.
[01:28:29.459 --> 01:28:31.440]  And we've got a bunch of specials that are about to end.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.981]  A bunch of specials did end.
[01:28:32.981 --> 01:28:36.202]  The Vitamin Mineral Fusion is still there, but we went back to full price.
[01:28:36.202 --> 01:28:38.082]  But we've got the Secret 12 B12.

[01:28:57.757 --> 01:29:11.666]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[01:29:11.666 --> 01:29:15.969]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[01:29:15.969 --> 01:29:18.511]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:20.672]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[01:29:20.672 --> 01:29:27.397]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[01:29:27.837 --> 01:29:32.580]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.902]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[01:29:36.902 --> 01:29:39.363]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[01:29:39.363 --> 01:29:44.366]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.

[01:30:57.133 --> 01:30:59.014]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:30:59.014 --> 01:31:01.035]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:01.035 --> 01:31:03.957]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:03.957 --> 01:31:10.021]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:10.021 --> 01:31:19.206]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:22.488]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[01:31:22.728 --> 01:31:26.731]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:26.731 --> 01:31:34.757]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:34.757 --> 01:31:35.838]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:36.938 --> 01:31:40.879]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:40.879 --> 01:31:44.440]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:51.162]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[01:31:57.310 --> 01:32:02.036]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:02.036 --> 01:32:12.190]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[01:32:12.210 --> 01:32:12.470]  I think?
[01:32:31.144 --> 01:32:32.085]  We're good to go.
[01:33:00.638 --> 01:33:03.250]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:40.706 --> 01:33:45.052]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are sending out the SOS to the world.
[01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:55.647]  There are global tyrants seizing on every tragedy to push global tyranny and mass control over the population.
[01:33:57.233 --> 01:34:00.757]  Infowars.com is the main news site.
[01:34:00.757 --> 01:34:04.240]  Our new site is newswars.com.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:14.830]  And before I go to your calls and more news, just briefly, I cannot impress upon you on my knees for your children, my children, our collective future.
[01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:21.637]  I cannot impress upon you enough the power that you hold in your hands to take on these globalists and their fraud.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:28.984]  When you shoot a video of a live event and upload it, you create a history.
[01:34:28.984 --> 01:34:42.654]  When you tell somebody about a news site, when you share an article, when you share a tip, when you call into a talk radio show, when you call into C-SPAN, everybody together stands up to the bullies and lets them know we have the moral high ground.
[01:34:43.646 --> 01:34:51.632]  We're the majority of every color, every creed, all red blood, one race, and we're not going away.
[01:34:51.632 --> 01:34:53.033]  We're not backing down.
[01:34:53.033 --> 01:34:54.354]  We're not giving in.
[01:34:54.354 --> 01:34:59.058]  And they know we're breaking their will right now.
[01:34:59.058 --> 01:35:01.840]  That's why they're panicking.
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:03.661]  The big fourth turning is here.
[01:35:03.661 --> 01:35:05.563]  The next big awakening is here.
[01:35:05.563 --> 01:35:07.284]  And this is the big one.
[01:35:07.284 --> 01:35:09.105]  History goes in cycles.
[01:35:09.105 --> 01:35:10.266]  The globalists admit this.
[01:35:10.266 --> 01:35:10.807]  They know this.
[01:35:13.362 --> 01:35:16.843]  And they know they're in deep trouble.
[01:35:16.843 --> 01:35:19.204]  But they're not going quietly.
[01:35:19.204 --> 01:35:22.225]  And we're not going to have some utopia on the other side of this.
[01:35:22.225 --> 01:35:25.846]  We're just not going to have truly psychotic people trying to direct our downfall.
[01:35:25.846 --> 01:35:30.568]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls right now, and then coming up, more on the Las Vegas shooter.
[01:35:30.568 --> 01:35:36.270]  The Sheriff's Department came out now and said he most certainly did not act alone.
[01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:37.971]  That's a quote.
[01:35:37.971 --> 01:35:38.531]  But we tell you,
[01:35:39.727 --> 01:35:41.928]  Our sources believe he did not act alone.
[01:35:41.928 --> 01:35:43.369]  There's evidence he didn't act alone.
[01:35:43.369 --> 01:35:45.151]  There was a woman inside there with him.
[01:35:45.151 --> 01:35:46.151]  We got the receipts.
[01:35:46.151 --> 01:35:46.912]  We published them.
[01:35:46.912 --> 01:35:50.034]  Drudge linked to it.
[01:35:50.034 --> 01:35:53.036]  Then the Sheriff's Department comes out and confirms it all.
[01:35:53.036 --> 01:35:57.919]  Just like we told you, there was Antifa and Islamic material inside the hotel.
[01:35:57.919 --> 01:36:02.662]  There was Antifa stuff everywhere and photos of Middle Eastern trips.
[01:36:02.662 --> 01:36:06.084]  That's the exact quote from the source.
[01:36:06.084 --> 01:36:09.046]  And the Middle Eastern trips have now been confirmed.
[01:36:10.290 --> 01:36:11.910]  This guy was a pilot.
[01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:14.491]  This guy had millions of dollars a year of discretionary income.
[01:36:14.491 --> 01:36:17.852]  He was an investor.
[01:36:17.852 --> 01:36:18.692]  And how do you do it?
[01:36:18.692 --> 01:36:20.812]  The casinos don't track the money you bring in.
[01:36:20.812 --> 01:36:23.613]  They're money laundering facilities in many cases.
[01:36:23.613 --> 01:36:25.393]  You go in.
[01:36:25.393 --> 01:36:29.914]  You spend sometimes $100,000.
[01:36:29.914 --> 01:36:30.454]  You lose.
[01:36:30.454 --> 01:36:31.094]  You bring out $60,000.
[01:36:31.094 --> 01:36:32.974]  Doesn't matter.
[01:36:32.974 --> 01:36:34.795]  You just laundered the money.
[01:36:34.795 --> 01:36:35.295]  Tax-free.
[01:36:37.665 --> 01:36:39.206]  And we've gone over his whole MO.
[01:36:39.206 --> 01:36:41.246]  What do you, the callers, think?
[01:36:41.246 --> 01:36:43.367]  I always love the angles and things you raise.
[01:36:43.367 --> 01:36:48.249]  So, Zach, Chris, Jeff, Patricia, Paul, Jesse, Kim, we're going to all of you.
[01:36:48.249 --> 01:36:50.470]  Then I'll make it to Tom Brokaw, Blaming Gun Owners.
[01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:51.130]  That's the thing.
[01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:51.850]  You did it.
[01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:52.451]  You're bad.
[01:36:52.451 --> 01:36:53.431]  You're a murderer.
[01:36:53.431 --> 01:36:58.353]  You didn't know you killed those people?
[01:36:58.353 --> 01:37:03.035]  But I want to play one thing first, and I promise I'm going to your calls.
[01:37:03.035 --> 01:37:03.695]  This is a clip.
[01:37:04.821 --> 01:37:09.405]  Shot by friends of the man who was shot in the leg.
[01:37:09.405 --> 01:37:15.790]  And Melania Trump and President Trump went and visited everyone at multiple hospitals.
[01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:18.112]  Now remember, they do this all the time, the personal touch.
[01:37:18.112 --> 01:37:21.915]  And the media says, oh, he didn't really visit Scalise.
[01:37:21.915 --> 01:37:26.579]  And they even said yesterday, oh, he's not really visiting people.
[01:37:26.579 --> 01:37:28.641]  But I know folks that know Trump.
[01:37:28.641 --> 01:37:30.222]  He'll call sometimes.
[01:37:30.222 --> 01:37:31.583]  He's in the hospitality business.
[01:37:31.583 --> 01:37:33.385]  His real money was made in condos he sells.
[01:37:35.281 --> 01:37:42.965]  That Trump will make 500 phone calls to people renting just to make sure they're happy.
[01:37:42.965 --> 01:37:45.266]  Because he has tens of thousands renting from him.
[01:37:45.266 --> 01:37:53.129]  Now, he can't do that as much as President now, but he's the type of guy, when I got married in January, remarried, he called up to congratulate me.
[01:37:53.129 --> 01:37:55.490]  We talked about five minutes.
[01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:56.770]  Then he wanted to talk to my wife.
[01:37:56.770 --> 01:38:00.272]  They talked about five minutes.
[01:38:00.272 --> 01:38:00.992]  That's when he was President.
[01:38:03.493 --> 01:38:04.333]  And that's the kind of stuff.
[01:38:04.333 --> 01:38:05.634]  Now, you don't get those calls now.
[01:38:05.634 --> 01:38:11.596]  I mean, some people get calls about, don't worry, we're not going in to take Assad out.
[01:38:11.596 --> 01:38:13.137]  And don't worry, we're going to get that tax cut.
[01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:16.258]  Don't believe that stuff you heard and let folks know.
[01:38:16.258 --> 01:38:19.839]  But they're fighting to keep him from calling.
[01:38:19.839 --> 01:38:21.880]  They're so jealous, they pull their hair out.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:29.523]  But just to see them lie and say that Trump never actually visits anybody, it's all a fraud.
[01:38:29.523 --> 01:38:31.324]  Obama's the one that didn't go to hurricanes.
[01:38:32.637 --> 01:38:34.958]  But again, they invert reality.
[01:38:34.958 --> 01:38:38.100]  Look what they just tried in Puerto Rico, but it blew up in their face.
[01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.322]  They were blocking it, the Democrats, costing lives!
[01:38:42.322 --> 01:38:44.303]  And of course this guy had help.
[01:38:44.303 --> 01:38:45.444]  And he's got a leftist cutout.
[01:38:45.444 --> 01:38:49.666]  And he's got the Antifa material.
[01:38:49.666 --> 01:38:53.088]  Now, was it a sting of Antifa buying weapons?
[01:38:53.088 --> 01:38:57.611]  Who say they're going to have this uprising in October and November, and they got all the weapons on the way, all those videos?
[01:38:57.611 --> 01:38:58.451]  I don't know!
[01:38:58.451 --> 01:38:59.132]  I don't know!
[01:38:59.132 --> 01:39:01.053]  Law enforcement doesn't know, exactly.
[01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:03.696]  From my sources.
[01:39:03.696 --> 01:39:07.397]  And it's all compartmentalized.
[01:39:07.397 --> 01:39:14.339]  And we know Trump doesn't control all these agencies, and that most of the higher-ups are globalists, so the President is working to get information out.
[01:39:14.339 --> 01:39:21.801]  That's why he was in Vegas, was also to talk to law enforcement from different agencies himself, privately, and say, what really happened?
[01:39:21.801 --> 01:39:23.502]  Spill your guts, I'm the President.
[01:39:23.502 --> 01:39:27.043]  You talk about hands-on, this is like John Wayne for real, folks.
[01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:29.803]  Alright.
[01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:30.764]  How long until break here?
[01:39:30.764 --> 01:39:33.966]  Got a new clock.
[01:39:33.966 --> 01:39:38.810]  Let's go ahead and start going to calls.
[01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:40.992]  Let's go ahead and talk to Zach in Illinois.
[01:39:40.992 --> 01:39:42.393]  Zach, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:45.555]  Hi Alex.
[01:39:45.555 --> 01:39:58.486]  I read a lot of news, and I can't even really form an opinion without reading, like, I mean, probably five different articles, because, I mean, it's not that I can't think for myself, but I like to get a lot of other opinions.
[01:39:59.178 --> 01:40:02.939]  But if these people think there's only one shooter, they're crazy, man.
[01:40:02.939 --> 01:40:05.339]  The sheriff even said it yesterday.
[01:40:05.339 --> 01:40:07.860]  There's no way that he could have acted alone.
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:09.180]  There's no way.
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:23.063]  And I think with how he was like 500 to 600 yards away from the festival, and he had some high-powered rifles, but I think there had to have been somebody through the back.
[01:40:24.332 --> 01:40:26.773]  Um, toward the MGM Resort.
[01:40:26.773 --> 01:40:41.562]  Because... Sir, you're really smart and we've been still investigating this before we release our full findings, but I have talked to people in Army Intelligence, in Army Special Operations, Navy SEALs, former leaders of major SEAL teams.
[01:40:41.562 --> 01:40:45.324]  I mean, Craig Sawyer was a group leader in SEAL Team 6.
[01:40:45.324 --> 01:40:46.585]  I mean, that's the high levels it gets.
[01:40:47.768 --> 01:40:58.198]  And they all say, multiple shooters, different guns going off at the same time, different caliber, one's a full belt gun, it's not a crank, or a, you know, these, these, these, these, these.
[01:40:59.685 --> 01:41:03.286]  Break, stop, backs, these jump guns or whatever they're calling them.
[01:41:03.286 --> 01:41:04.987]  And what you're saying is absolutely on target.
[01:41:04.987 --> 01:41:06.467]  And we've got all these videos.
[01:41:06.467 --> 01:41:21.392]  I have a five-minute compilation I'm going to get to after some calls that Rob Dews is uploading right now to InfoWars.com, where it's just all the witnesses and you hear super far off, it's not an echo, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then right up close, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, right beneath Mandalay.
[01:41:21.392 --> 01:41:26.774]  So 100%, you're hearing this and it looks very conclusive.
[01:41:26.774 --> 01:41:28.415]  Now, we don't get in a fight with each other.
[01:41:29.315 --> 01:41:35.860]  I'm not mad at Paul that a lot of eyewitnesses were on the ground saying that they thought there was, you know, only one shooter.
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.101]  Regardless, he had help.
[01:41:37.101 --> 01:41:39.002]  Regardless, our sources have been accurate.
[01:41:39.002 --> 01:41:41.844]  It's okay for all of us to have different theories and investigate this.
[01:41:41.844 --> 01:41:45.147]  But mainstream media wants to tell us we can't watch the footage.
[01:41:45.147 --> 01:41:46.688]  We can't look into his past.
[01:41:46.688 --> 01:41:47.929]  We can't do research.
[01:41:47.929 --> 01:41:53.693]  We're just supposed to back off and not know what happened and then let them blame gun owners and blame America and blame Trump.
[01:41:53.973 --> 01:41:55.014]  No, we're not doing that.
[01:41:55.014 --> 01:41:56.395]  We're actually investigating it.
[01:41:56.395 --> 01:41:59.898]  And the Democrats said, we're coming to kill Trump supporters in October.
[01:41:59.898 --> 01:42:00.818]  We're going to kill you.
[01:42:00.818 --> 01:42:02.219]  The revolution starts.
[01:42:02.219 --> 01:42:03.921]  And I predicted it would happen.
[01:42:03.921 --> 01:42:06.843]  And it has perfect timing.
[01:42:06.843 --> 01:42:09.225]  And the hotel clearly is covering up.
[01:42:09.225 --> 01:42:12.067]  And clearly, he couldn't get all those guns in there for five days.
[01:42:12.067 --> 01:42:14.069]  And they're lying about how many days he was there.
[01:42:14.069 --> 01:42:20.514]  And the hotel has all the connections to the leftist and George Soros and the, quote, resistance group, as it's called.
[01:42:20.514 --> 01:42:21.154]  What do you make of that?
[01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:28.250]  They have, they're opening a new MGM resort in the Middle East.
[01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:36.717]  So like, this guy is definitely involved, the guy who, the people who own the MGM, they have, they have to, this is why ISIS is claiming responsibility for it.
[01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:37.958]  Oh absolutely!
[01:42:37.958 --> 01:42:42.722]  Listen, listen, their biggest group they give to is CARE, the big U.S.
[01:42:42.722 --> 01:42:43.863]  Muslim group.
[01:42:43.863 --> 01:42:47.066]  I mean the whole thing is unbelievably stinky.
[01:42:48.197 --> 01:42:56.721]  And you know who it smells like, ladies and gentlemen, the filthy, evil, murderous, cold-blooded Democratic Party that funded the Arab Spring.

[01:44:05.268 --> 01:44:13.353]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:44:13.653 --> 01:44:18.515]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:47:16.849 --> 01:47:24.718]  We are in such a critical time.
[01:47:24.718 --> 01:47:28.522]  The globalists are trying to stop a worldwide populist movement.
[01:47:28.522 --> 01:47:30.544]  They said mass terror is coming.
[01:47:30.544 --> 01:47:32.206]  Of course they want to pin it on the liberty movement.
[01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:37.752]  All evidence points towards globalist deep state operatives.
[01:47:37.752 --> 01:47:40.474]  The motive, the target, the evidence coming out.
[01:47:40.474 --> 01:47:41.655]  We've been completely validated.
[01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:44.296]  The globalists are upset.
[01:47:44.296 --> 01:47:49.720]  I want to go to Kim in Wisconsin next, then Paul in Georgia, then Jeff in Arizona, Chris in Arizona.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.081]  We're going to get to everybody.
[01:47:51.081 --> 01:47:53.022]  But what a great caller earlier bringing up
[01:47:54.312 --> 01:47:55.932]  The multiple shooter situation.
[01:47:55.932 --> 01:48:00.473]  I understand a lot of witnesses that were up close say it was one shooter from the hotel.
[01:48:00.473 --> 01:48:01.654]  We get obsessed over it all day.
[01:48:01.654 --> 01:48:02.674]  We know the guy got help.
[01:48:02.674 --> 01:48:04.795]  The Sheriff's Department says that's clear.
[01:48:04.795 --> 01:48:06.195]  We know he's getting radicalized.
[01:48:06.195 --> 01:48:07.255]  We know he's being covered up.
[01:48:07.255 --> 01:48:09.276]  We know somebody was giving him millions of dollars.
[01:48:09.276 --> 01:48:12.836]  We know the hotel is in deep with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:48:12.836 --> 01:48:13.417]  Admittedly.
[01:48:13.417 --> 01:48:16.597]  I mean, this is really suspicious.
[01:48:16.597 --> 01:48:22.819]  And we also know, if you pull back from it, that they lied about how many days he was in there.
[01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:25.129]  And again, we broke that.
[01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:28.810]  And I'm not bragging, it's just, we're totally on target.
[01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:32.271]  That's why they're so scared and trying to destroy us, because we'll just report what's really going on.
[01:48:32.271 --> 01:48:33.271]  We're not stupid.
[01:48:33.271 --> 01:48:35.051]  We know the MO.
[01:48:35.051 --> 01:48:38.392]  We don't know exactly what happened, but we know there's a cover-up going on right now.
[01:48:38.392 --> 01:48:41.773]  And we know who had the motive and the history.
[01:48:41.773 --> 01:48:52.995]  But, I mean, there's particular footage that I rolled last night in a special broadcast I did that was internet-only, titled, Incredible Must-See Footage of Second Shooter.
[01:48:52.995 --> 01:48:53.115]  And
[01:48:54.505 --> 01:48:59.149]  You also got police scanners, uh, with multiple shooters.
[01:48:59.149 --> 01:49:00.510]  And it's not just confusion.
[01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:05.054]  A lady's in a cab, you hear off far, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:49:05.054 --> 01:49:05.654]  It's a gun.
[01:49:05.654 --> 01:49:09.658]  And then right above her, right where the shooter is, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!
[01:49:09.658 --> 01:49:12.520]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:13.181]  And it's not like...
[01:49:14.358 --> 01:49:17.281]  He shoots first loud and then you hear an echo a half second later.
[01:49:17.281 --> 01:49:38.059]  It's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[01:49:39.718 --> 01:49:42.059]  But that's where people are going, so fine.
[01:49:42.059 --> 01:49:43.721]  Kim, you're on the air from Wisconsin.
[01:49:43.721 --> 01:49:46.362]  Thanks for holding.
[01:49:46.362 --> 01:49:47.123]  Hi, Alex.
[01:49:47.123 --> 01:50:01.552]  I was just wondering your opinion on some of the admitted reports, and I'm not insinuating anything, but I think it should be looked into, of musicians at the concert partying near the 32nd level in the Mandalay Bay.
[01:50:02.862 --> 01:50:09.254]  Uh, and also why they left the lights on and didn't say run for your life after the shooting started.
[01:50:09.254 --> 01:50:11.338]  I have two other points too, but go ahead and respond to that one.
[01:50:12.776 --> 01:50:15.598]  Well, I guess that was one of the sweet levels, so I don't know about that.
[01:50:15.598 --> 01:50:17.839]  I mean, I don't think there are any musicians involved.
[01:50:17.839 --> 01:50:24.223]  And then you also got them panicking, leaving the lights on, because they're not sitting at the switch thinking, if a mass shooting happens, I'm going to turn the lights off.
[01:50:24.223 --> 01:50:31.167]  I mean, I think even some of the smartest minds in the world aren't just sitting right by the light switch in case a mass shooting starts, thinking to pull the switch.
[01:50:31.167 --> 01:50:35.409]  Plus, more people might get killed stampeding over each other in the ensuing panic.
[01:50:35.409 --> 01:50:35.990]  So, what do you think?
[01:50:39.795 --> 01:50:43.118]  You know, it's hard to say because you can imagine yourself in the same situation.
[01:50:43.118 --> 01:50:45.920]  You see people start dropping if you would just run for your life.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:52.405]  You know, the technician guys, as you know, who operate the lights, they're in back or they're in some booth.
[01:50:52.405 --> 01:50:54.707]  Like you said, maybe it was just in a panic type of thing.
[01:50:54.707 --> 01:51:01.673]  But in that video alluded to earlier, the gentleman walking around in the field with the garbage on the ground.
[01:51:01.673 --> 01:51:06.697]  He's asking also about the lights and how they were on during the shooting and off
[01:51:07.602 --> 01:51:11.680]  Beforehand and Brother this thing smells
[01:51:13.266 --> 01:51:16.288]  Like the biggest rat on planet Earth, okay?
[01:51:16.288 --> 01:51:17.268]  Look at who owns it.
[01:51:17.268 --> 01:51:18.369]  Look who's doing it.
[01:51:18.369 --> 01:51:19.549]  Look at the timing.
[01:51:19.549 --> 01:51:22.811]  Look how the Global has said they were going to start the overthrow in October.
[01:51:22.811 --> 01:51:26.673]  Look at all our experts predicting an attack on a big event like this to trigger it.
[01:51:26.673 --> 01:51:27.853]  I mean, we're here.
[01:51:27.853 --> 01:51:31.915]  And I'm telling you, a bunch more is about to happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:31.915 --> 01:51:32.756]  I'm telling you.
[01:51:32.756 --> 01:51:33.796]  I've seen all the evidence.
[01:51:33.796 --> 01:51:35.037]  I feel it in my gut.
[01:51:35.037 --> 01:51:36.117]  They're making their move.
[01:51:36.117 --> 01:51:36.938]  What do you say, Kim?
[01:51:38.749 --> 01:51:42.551]  Well, you know, they've done this time and time again in countries around the world.
[01:51:42.551 --> 01:51:42.911]  That's right.
[01:51:42.911 --> 01:51:44.272]  I think it's very interesting.
[01:51:44.272 --> 01:51:55.199]  If you allude back to Mondanity in the 90s and start with the first Clinton administration... Well, there was also Tasmania and the stuff there with the big stage shootings and how they used that to ban guns.
[01:51:55.199 --> 01:51:57.180]  I mean, yes, this is a formulae.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:52:03.123]  And then use our hurt hearts of 40, 50, 60 dead people to then make us all feel guilty like we did it.
[01:52:03.123 --> 01:52:03.924]  So we give up our guns.
[01:52:04.204 --> 01:52:06.765]  That's what Kimmel and Schumer and these dirtbags are doing.
[01:52:06.765 --> 01:52:07.585]  Good to hear from you, Kim.
[01:52:07.585 --> 01:52:08.525]  Great points.
[01:52:08.525 --> 01:52:11.666]  Paul, we're going to go to Georgia and talk to Paul.
[01:52:11.666 --> 01:52:12.546]  Paul, thanks for calling.
[01:52:12.546 --> 01:52:16.467]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:52:16.467 --> 01:52:17.107]  Hello?
[01:52:17.107 --> 01:52:18.828]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:52:18.828 --> 01:52:21.629]  Yeah, I just want to bring up a point.
[01:52:21.629 --> 01:52:26.770]  Steve Kucinich came on yesterday on David Knight's show and said this whole thing didn't happen.
[01:52:28.004 --> 01:52:29.005]  Are you aware of that?
[01:52:29.005 --> 01:52:30.166]  Yeah, I think it's preposterous.
[01:52:30.166 --> 01:52:31.227]  I've watched the raw footage.
[01:52:31.227 --> 01:52:32.888]  I've talked to folks that were there.
[01:52:32.888 --> 01:52:37.432]  You can't fake people dying and bleeding out.
[01:52:37.432 --> 01:52:38.452]  He can have his opinion.
[01:52:38.452 --> 01:52:40.434]  I can have mine.
[01:52:40.434 --> 01:52:42.676]  But I don't buy into that.
[01:52:42.676 --> 01:52:44.938]  Well, it's almost like a disinformation campaign.
[01:52:44.938 --> 01:52:47.179]  Is he still working for the CIA here?
[01:52:47.179 --> 01:52:50.482]  I mean, this whole thing... Well, I think that's safe to say, yeah.
[01:52:50.482 --> 01:52:54.245]  A deep state coup to provoke a response.
[01:52:54.245 --> 01:52:56.007]  This was an attack on middle America.
[01:52:57.401 --> 01:53:04.987]  The target, just like Colonel Schaffer said, just like Colonel Schaffer said, the target is the motive, and the top psychiatrist and everybody else.
[01:53:04.987 --> 01:53:06.028]  Of course!
[01:53:06.028 --> 01:53:06.469]  Of course!
[01:53:06.469 --> 01:53:07.730]  They want us to jump the gun.
[01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:11.733]  They want us to start shooting at BLM and Antifa.
[01:53:11.733 --> 01:53:19.279]  That's what my, that's what my highest level... Mr. and Mrs. America, hand over your guns.
[01:53:19.279 --> 01:53:21.521]  That was the goal of this.
[01:53:21.521 --> 01:53:25.264]  The next step is taking a shot at our president.
[01:53:25.264 --> 01:53:26.265]  And at what point
[01:53:27.099 --> 01:53:31.462]  Does Alex Jones put down the mic and pick up the gun?
[01:53:31.462 --> 01:53:34.425]  Well, I always love how folks... Hold on, let me talk now.
[01:53:34.425 --> 01:53:40.650]  You're talking over me.
[01:53:40.650 --> 01:53:41.771]  I have picked up the gun.
[01:53:41.771 --> 01:53:44.873]  Information warfare is 90% of modern war.
[01:53:44.873 --> 01:53:45.694]  Okay?
[01:53:45.694 --> 01:53:47.875]  So, I'm here trying to win peacefully.
[01:53:47.875 --> 01:53:49.497]  We are politically winning peacefully.
[01:53:49.497 --> 01:53:50.477]  And...
[01:53:52.051 --> 01:53:55.232]  They're, you just said, they're trying to elicit a response.
[01:53:55.232 --> 01:54:05.954]  They just tacked Flyover Country, Bitter Clingers, Middle America, the left celebrating and saying you deserve to die, CBS executives, Big Democrats, Hollywood stars, they're scum.
[01:54:05.954 --> 01:54:13.776]  Newspaper editors, newspaper editorialists, they're out there saying give us your guns, scum, see what it's like to get killed, trying to terrorize us.
[01:54:13.776 --> 01:54:14.676]  It's clear, okay?
[01:54:14.676 --> 01:54:16.836]  They're involved, they ran it, they've done it.
[01:54:16.836 --> 01:54:18.337]  All the evidence points towards that.
[01:54:18.337 --> 01:54:18.577]  I'm 95% sure.
[01:54:20.154 --> 01:54:21.355]  The motive, the history.
[01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:37.984]  But then in your next breath, when is Jones gonna pick up the gun like, I haven't done work, like I haven't done enough, like I'm some lazy schmo who's been fighting against America, and then I'm supposed to say, I'm General Jones, and let's saddle up and prepare for war with who?
[01:54:37.984 --> 01:54:40.285]  The government has got good people and bad people in it.
[01:54:40.285 --> 01:54:41.946]  We're fighting an intellectual war.
[01:54:42.887 --> 01:54:50.816]  So, uh, I just, it's oxymoronic to ask me when I pick up weapons, uh, sounds like offensively.
[01:54:50.816 --> 01:54:52.017]  What are you saying?
[01:54:52.017 --> 01:54:55.340]  No, when would you tell us the time is here is what I'm saying.
[01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:59.285]  How long, when does InfoWars go off the air and go into the foxhole?
[01:55:00.373 --> 01:55:15.964]  Well I think at the point we're a good canary in the coal mine and I don't say this is a dead man's switch for my own sake but I mean if they take me down or grab me or kill me I'm not saying go out and do anything but they're coming after you next and if they kill the president
[01:55:16.784 --> 01:55:28.889]  They're going to then have a bunch of false flags to make it look like the Liberty Movement are terrorists or whatever, to try to demonize us further so that we apologize, they break our will, we turn our guns in, and they take their time rounding us up.
[01:55:28.889 --> 01:55:31.790]  So I think people have to make their own decisions about that.
[01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:38.592]  And they also have to understand that the police and military won't know what's going on too much during all this, just like the public.
[01:55:38.592 --> 01:55:42.474]  And so it's important to realize that if that's going on, that's not your target.
[01:55:43.433 --> 01:55:45.958]  Everybody needs to be discussing who runs this.
[01:55:45.958 --> 01:55:47.080]  Who is the enemy?
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.325]  Who are the vocal figureheads of it?
[01:55:49.325 --> 01:55:51.068]  Who is quarterbacking it?
[01:55:51.068 --> 01:55:53.853]  Who is setting it up?
[01:55:53.853 --> 01:55:55.276]  Who is the foreign force?
[01:55:56.317 --> 01:56:01.361]  And I think that's why most of them have already evacuated the country because they're getting ready for this.
[01:56:01.361 --> 01:56:04.423]  But they're not going to be safe in Australia or New Zealand.
[01:56:04.423 --> 01:56:05.824]  They're not going to be safe in Europe.
[01:56:05.824 --> 01:56:07.265]  They're not going to be safe in the Cook Islands.
[01:56:07.265 --> 01:56:09.407]  They're not going to be safe on Kauai.
[01:56:09.407 --> 01:56:10.328]  We've all identified them.
[01:56:10.328 --> 01:56:11.729]  Everybody knows who they are.
[01:56:11.729 --> 01:56:16.832]  And they will be brought to justice if they're able to launch this civil war.
[01:56:16.832 --> 01:56:17.573]  Know that.
[01:56:17.573 --> 01:56:19.755]  They will be defeated.
[01:56:19.755 --> 01:56:21.056]  And it's important to let them know that.
[01:56:21.056 --> 01:56:21.316]  Go ahead.
[01:56:23.022 --> 01:56:24.523]  Well, first of all, it wasn't a shot at you.
[01:56:24.523 --> 01:56:27.966]  You're doing tremendously more than the rest of us just listening.
[01:56:27.966 --> 01:56:29.708]  I love the products.
[01:56:29.708 --> 01:56:33.451]  I'm a listener for several years, since well before the election.
[01:56:33.451 --> 01:56:41.037]  I'm a Trump supporter, and if they take a shot at our president, I don't think he would have to tell anyone to take action.
[01:56:41.037 --> 01:56:47.262]  I know, but sir, what I'm saying is, and God bless you, I didn't mean to get grumpy with you, it's just this stuff's very frustrating, so I'm sorry I misread what you were saying.
[01:56:47.262 --> 01:56:48.263]  What I'm getting at here is,
[01:56:51.128 --> 01:57:05.794]  What they'll do is, they'll probably blow up a nursery school, or a bunch of kids, or a football game, or shoot them up, right at the same time they kill the President, to have that overshadow the killing of the President to demonize his supporters.
[01:57:05.794 --> 01:57:08.815]  So, I understand you're not going to have to get directed where to go.
[01:57:08.815 --> 01:57:13.197]  The point is, they're going to do events to demonize you preemptively.
[01:57:13.197 --> 01:57:13.997]  You understand?
[01:57:13.997 --> 01:57:17.818]  This is a test just to maneuver us into the mind frame they want.
[01:57:17.818 --> 01:57:18.359]  This is 100% staged, brother.
[01:57:20.953 --> 01:57:23.295]  So I'm saying, this is them taking the safety off.
[01:57:23.295 --> 01:57:24.196]  They're cleared to fire.
[01:57:24.196 --> 01:57:25.957]  They've got us in their crosshairs right now.
[01:57:25.957 --> 01:57:29.460]  You understand?
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:30.201]  God bless you, brother.
[01:57:30.201 --> 01:57:32.683]  All right, I'm going to come back and take more calls.
[01:57:32.683 --> 01:57:38.507]  And once Gavin McGinnis gets on with us, I'm going to play four or five minutes that Rob News put together of all the eyewitnesses saying multiple shooters.
[01:57:38.507 --> 01:57:42.370]  But you can get confused by a guy shooting from a building and it bounces off another building.
[01:57:45.438 --> 01:57:46.299]  That's not what I'm saying.
[01:58:01.049 --> 01:58:01.349]  I think?
[01:58:20.445 --> 01:58:20.885]  We're good.

[01:59:49.999 --> 01:59:52.601]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:06.372]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.165 --> 02:00:29.227]  The globalists want to condition you that there's only mainstream media, and there's only what the establishment puts out.
[02:00:29.227 --> 02:00:31.168]  And everybody else is an idiot.
[02:00:31.168 --> 02:00:36.250]  But once the spell is broken, nothing can put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:45.152]  Nothing can reconstruct the thin eggshell lies of Humpty Dumpty.
[02:00:45.152 --> 02:00:46.753]  Go back to your phone calls right now.
[02:00:48.513 --> 02:00:52.677]  Let's go ahead and go to Chris in Arizona.
[02:00:52.677 --> 02:00:55.380]  Chris, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:56.261]  Hey, no problem, Alex.
[02:00:56.261 --> 02:00:59.163]  Hey, I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:00:59.163 --> 02:01:00.064]  I got a question for you.
[02:01:00.064 --> 02:01:00.725]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:00.725 --> 02:01:02.346]  I'm curious to get your take on it.
[02:01:02.346 --> 02:01:08.893]  Okay, so the police said that the cameras that were in Steven Paddock's hotel, in the hotel, were not recording.
[02:01:08.893 --> 02:01:13.097]  And do you think these cameras could have been transmitting a live feed to the accomplices?
[02:01:13.829 --> 02:01:20.691]  And also, how would he have been able to install these cameras when, what was it, the Mandalay Bay?
[02:01:20.691 --> 02:01:25.352]  Well, they have surveillance systems that are equivalent to the Pentagon.
[02:01:25.352 --> 02:01:27.092]  I'm just curious to get your take on that.
[02:01:27.092 --> 02:01:35.834]  Well, that's why the sheriff, you can't act, it's not fake, is completely exhausted in these videos, these press conferences, and totally freaked out.
[02:01:35.834 --> 02:01:41.496]  And when he talks about how they're looking at radicalization because of what they found, he just shakes his head.
[02:01:41.496 --> 02:01:42.636]  And then,
[02:01:44.761 --> 02:01:48.806]  He says, but we don't want the folks to know that we could be on their trail, but obviously we're on the trails.
[02:01:48.806 --> 02:01:56.875]  And then the new press conference last night, he says, yes, a woman was there, their receipts, they've confirmed what we broke, but Judge Gary is accurate again.
[02:01:56.875 --> 02:01:58.437]  Boom, boom, boom, over and over again.
[02:01:58.437 --> 02:02:02.321]  I'm just saying that because they keep saying we're not credible, because we are.
[02:02:02.321 --> 02:02:04.984]  And then clearly they're saying he had wireless cameras outside.
[02:02:05.825 --> 02:02:09.787]  He had two suites, there were other people there.
[02:02:09.787 --> 02:02:11.887]  These hotels are like Fort Knox.
[02:02:11.887 --> 02:02:15.128]  They're watching everything you do, even if you're a VIP guest.
[02:02:15.128 --> 02:02:17.409]  They knew what he was doing, and you look at the M.O.
[02:02:17.409 --> 02:02:25.872]  of the owners, hooked him with CARE and the Muslim Brotherhood, and building stuff over in the Middle East, and hooked him with George Soros' resistance movement.
[02:02:25.872 --> 02:02:27.133]  That's in the news.
[02:02:27.133 --> 02:02:29.594]  I mean, this is literally a George Soros combine.
[02:02:31.035 --> 02:02:32.197]  Where this happened.
[02:02:32.197 --> 02:02:33.478]  So what do you think, brother?
[02:02:33.478 --> 02:02:35.281]  I mean, look at who they targeted.
[02:02:35.281 --> 02:02:36.282]  Look at the time frame.
[02:02:36.282 --> 02:02:38.285]  Look at the promise of October 1st.
[02:02:38.285 --> 02:02:43.653]  I mean, it's scaring us all in the face.
[02:02:43.653 --> 02:02:44.214]  What do you think, Chris?
[02:02:45.876 --> 02:02:51.381]  I think that people that are awake are seeing through all this misinformation that they're putting out.
[02:02:51.381 --> 02:03:00.348]  And I saw last night on Fox that during that press conference they had that they were pretty upset about these conspiracy theories that people are reading online.
[02:03:00.348 --> 02:03:06.152]  And they're really not doing anything to counter that by not releasing any information.
[02:03:08.049 --> 02:03:08.289]  I'm sorry.
[02:03:24.481 --> 02:03:29.744]  And I really, I pray that nothing like this happens again.
[02:03:29.744 --> 02:03:31.484]  Unfortunately, I'm sure it will.
[02:03:31.484 --> 02:03:34.006]  I was about to say, I mean, they primed the pump.
[02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:35.766]  It's completely obvious.
[02:03:35.766 --> 02:03:37.487]  They're targeting an asleep population.
[02:03:37.487 --> 02:03:44.690]  For those of us that are awake, it's as obvious as the nose on somebody's face that Hillary rigged the debates and knew the questions.
[02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:46.071]  We said that the night it happened.
[02:03:46.071 --> 02:03:48.232]  And then it came out exactly what we said.
[02:03:48.232 --> 02:03:49.873]  She had the questions three weeks before.
[02:03:51.173 --> 02:03:52.454]  So see, we see it.
[02:03:52.454 --> 02:03:53.654]  We know it.
[02:03:53.654 --> 02:03:54.594]  You can see scripting.
[02:03:54.594 --> 02:03:56.095]  Well, we can see the scripting here.
[02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:57.515]  It's ridiculous.
[02:03:57.515 --> 02:04:05.258]  And the thing is, they've been told, part of the investigation, by all the Obama holdovers and the FBI and the ATF, you know, to shut this down.
[02:04:05.258 --> 02:04:07.719]  The President has to release it.
[02:04:07.719 --> 02:04:10.060]  I guarantee you, folks, it's antifa material.
[02:04:11.038 --> 02:04:13.619]  That was in the hotel and traveling to the Middle East.
[02:04:13.619 --> 02:04:16.060]  I was told that by the hostage rescue team.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:20.662]  You think they'd risk their careers and lives to tell me that if they weren't upset by lies being put out?
[02:04:20.662 --> 02:04:22.022]  That's real!
[02:04:22.022 --> 02:04:24.383]  That's why everything we've said has been now confirmed.
[02:04:24.383 --> 02:04:26.584]  Because it's the truth!
[02:04:26.584 --> 02:04:28.785]  God bless you, Chris.
[02:04:28.785 --> 02:04:30.425]  I can't even believe how hardcore this is.
[02:04:30.425 --> 02:04:31.866]  Believe me, I don't want this job.
[02:04:32.898 --> 02:04:35.781]  This is not about a power trip or being the big guy that's right.
[02:04:35.781 --> 02:04:38.124]  Because believe me, man, I'm whistling past the graveyard.
[02:04:38.124 --> 02:04:39.425]  I need your prayers.
[02:04:39.425 --> 02:04:40.687]  America needs your prayers.
[02:04:40.687 --> 02:04:42.349]  And those victims need your prayers.
[02:04:42.349 --> 02:04:43.290]  But get ready.
[02:04:43.290 --> 02:04:45.092]  The next attack's in the wings.
[02:04:45.092 --> 02:04:46.834]  I got chills up down my back.
[02:04:46.834 --> 02:04:47.815]  It's coming.
[02:04:47.815 --> 02:04:48.315]  It's coming.
[02:04:48.315 --> 02:04:49.677]  It's gonna be much worse.
[02:04:49.677 --> 02:04:52.580]  They could attack hundreds of targets in one night.
[02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:53.281]  It's Helter Skelter.
[02:04:55.646 --> 02:05:02.633]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[02:05:02.633 --> 02:05:08.138]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[02:05:08.138 --> 02:05:11.481]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[02:05:11.481 --> 02:05:13.843]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[02:05:13.843 --> 02:05:19.168]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[02:05:19.168 --> 02:05:20.750]  That is the ultimate concern.
[02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:27.174]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[02:05:27.174 --> 02:05:29.655]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:33.957]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[02:05:33.957 --> 02:05:38.700]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:44.103]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:49.126]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[02:05:49.446 --> 02:05:53.149]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[02:05:53.149 --> 02:06:00.334]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:00.334 --> 02:06:12.223]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:52.165 --> 02:06:58.988]  Gavin McInnes is our guest, and he's got a new, really fancy, non-blue screen studio.
[02:06:58.988 --> 02:07:08.292]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, or watch on some of the TV stations we're on across the country.
[02:07:08.292 --> 02:07:15.615]  And that's what Gavin's doing now, launching syndicated radio slash television, and I'm so excited to have the competition.
[02:07:17.661 --> 02:07:20.662]  I was eating during the break, a little bit down the wrong tube.
[02:07:20.662 --> 02:07:23.403]  Because I'm not in competition with anybody who wants freedom.
[02:07:23.403 --> 02:07:25.604]  I'm in competition with tyranny.
[02:07:25.604 --> 02:07:29.225]  And it's great to have Gavin, founder of Vice, and so much more here with us.
[02:07:29.225 --> 02:07:32.046]  Gavin, out of the gates, what do you say about Vegas?
[02:07:32.046 --> 02:07:32.946]  What's your gut tell you?
[02:07:34.504 --> 02:07:41.289]  Uh, I'm not a conspiracy guy, I tend to be pretty cynical about these things, but something, something leaks here.
[02:07:41.289 --> 02:07:46.333]  Remember that church that got shot up, that mosque, sorry, in Quebec?
[02:07:46.333 --> 02:08:00.104]  Uh, there was a guy, there was two people there, then there was one person there, it was pretty clear that the government was trying to hide, but even in that case, we knew within seconds that this guy had once clicked a like on a Facebook article about Le Pen.
[02:08:00.624 --> 02:08:03.005]  That was just a click many years before.
[02:08:03.005 --> 02:08:05.666]  So we're usually remarkably thorough.
[02:08:05.666 --> 02:08:08.327]  And this, this time we got nothing.
[02:08:08.327 --> 02:08:12.969]  No Facebook, no tweets, no family relations.
[02:08:12.969 --> 02:08:14.889]  I mean, how do we know so little?
[02:08:14.889 --> 02:08:17.830]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:18.411]  Absolutely.
[02:08:18.411 --> 02:08:19.831]  In fact, that's why I love getting you on.
[02:08:19.831 --> 02:08:21.592]  That's the one point I hadn't made.
[02:08:21.592 --> 02:08:24.173]  But I was thinking about that just the other day.
[02:08:25.287 --> 02:08:27.409]  How crazy this is, folks.
[02:08:27.409 --> 02:08:33.413]  We always, when it's a right-winger or a libertarian, we hear their entire Facebook history, their Twitter history.
[02:08:33.413 --> 02:08:39.959]  They've always visited Infowars.com, because the site's, you know, 50 times bigger than MSNBC.com.
[02:08:39.959 --> 02:08:42.080]  Of course people are visiting it, literally.
[02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:45.843]  But still, they always demonize Matt Drudge, myself.
[02:08:45.843 --> 02:08:48.885]  You would have heard this, but now they're shitting on it.
[02:08:48.885 --> 02:08:50.747]  And Gavin, I can tell you why.
[02:08:50.747 --> 02:08:51.387]  I got a call.
[02:08:52.248 --> 02:09:01.473]  Then it was confirmed later by text from the hostage rescue team that was there and they said indeed it was full of Antifa and Islamic paraphernalia.
[02:09:01.473 --> 02:09:02.634]  Wow.
[02:09:02.634 --> 02:09:18.662]  Yeah, the police feel like, and when I say the police I mean the top brass, obviously not the guys on the street, but the top brass in the government, they're better than us, they're smarter than us, we can't control ourselves, so what they'll do is they'll parse out information based on what we can handle.
[02:09:18.662 --> 02:09:20.203]  Because we can't handle the truth.
[02:09:20.203 --> 02:09:21.364]  Jack Nicholson was right.
[02:09:21.904 --> 02:09:26.026]  So they're just going to dole it out in little pieces to make sure we don't get too angry.
[02:09:26.026 --> 02:09:29.388]  And we saw this in Paris, if you recall, at the Bataclan.
[02:09:29.388 --> 02:09:32.270]  They said, oh, there was a shooting and we got the guys and it was very terrible.
[02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:34.091]  It was a freak accident, blah, blah, blah.
[02:09:34.091 --> 02:09:41.615]  And you go, then you find out a year later that they were eviscerating pregnant women, taking the babies out, the dying babies.
[02:09:41.615 --> 02:09:45.377]  They were cutting off men's genitalia and putting it in their mouths.
[02:09:45.857 --> 02:09:53.509]  But the mayor hid that information from us because it's too intense and it might lead to a backlash against Muslims, so they just doled out little pieces over time.
[02:09:53.509 --> 02:10:00.721]  But if he would have been a conservative doing that, of course a conservative wouldn't do that, you would see video of the testicles, I mean you would have seen the whole thing.
[02:10:02.375 --> 02:10:05.816]  This has to be that they figure we can't handle the truth.
[02:10:05.816 --> 02:10:11.977]  And it's funny how, when it's someone who's right-wing, we hear about it all, even when they're not necessarily right-wing.
[02:10:11.977 --> 02:10:20.098]  If some lunatic on pharmaceuticals is, in one picture, holding a Confederate flag, then we have evidence of Nazis and white power.
[02:10:20.098 --> 02:10:22.498]  And they just, they're happy to unleash that.
[02:10:22.498 --> 02:10:23.519]  Let's get that out.
[02:10:23.519 --> 02:10:24.659]  Let's get people killed.
[02:10:24.659 --> 02:10:29.820]  Let's get Nazis punched and make every conservative a Nazi and get all their lives in danger.
[02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:30.800]  That's fine.
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:31.740]  But if it's a liberal,
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:37.067]  Uh, no, I don't want to condone the NRA's narrative, so I'm not doing it.
[02:10:38.666 --> 02:10:42.028]  Gavin, what do you make of Jimmy Kimmel and all of them out of the gates?
[02:10:42.028 --> 02:10:50.454]  The talking point from Chuckie Schumer that we are all guilty collectively, that we all did it, that we're bad, that we're involved in a dirty business.
[02:10:50.454 --> 02:10:55.477]  To quote Kimmel last night, he said, gun owners are involved in this dirty business.
[02:10:55.477 --> 02:11:02.322]  This is next level leftist guilt tripping, just crazy, desperate attempt.
[02:11:02.322 --> 02:11:08.126]  Well, this guy has been in all these videos improperly handling guns, threatening to shoot me with a gun on TV once.
[02:11:08.986 --> 02:11:23.659]  Saying he's coming to kill me all the rest of it now He's pointing at me even though he has a bunch of bodyguards with guns on video But he's saying none of us can have guns and that we all are in a dirty business, but he owns guns So I guess he's saying that he is guilty
[02:11:24.716 --> 02:11:25.557]  It's amateur hour.
[02:11:25.557 --> 02:11:28.019]  We saw this with the NFL, taking a knee.
[02:11:28.019 --> 02:11:30.181]  You and I have been doing this for decades.
[02:11:30.181 --> 02:11:35.566]  When someone says they want to take a knee to police brutality, you say, oh, okay, so how many deaths are on just a year?
[02:11:35.566 --> 02:11:36.247]  What happened?
[02:11:36.247 --> 02:11:37.267]  Are you talking about Tamir Rice?
[02:11:37.267 --> 02:11:38.228]  Are you talking about Mike Brown?
[02:11:38.228 --> 02:11:39.369]  Are you talking about Trayvon Martin?
[02:11:39.369 --> 02:11:40.330]  Which case are you talking about?
[02:11:40.330 --> 02:11:41.151]  Let's get into it.
[02:11:41.151 --> 02:11:44.094]  And you realize, oh, no, I don't actually know what I'm talking about.
[02:11:44.094 --> 02:11:45.415]  I just like virtue signaling.
[02:11:45.775 --> 02:11:48.097]  And Jimmy Kimmel, crybaby Kimmel, I know him by the way.
[02:11:48.097 --> 02:11:50.860]  He's not a political guy, he's a sports guy.
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:53.863]  He loves sports, and he loves comedy, he loves his family.
[02:11:53.863 --> 02:12:02.411]  He sees someone die, and he just goes for the go-to rich guy thing, which is, guns are bad, Trump is bad, everyone's a Nazi.
[02:12:03.912 --> 02:12:05.593]  And it's just what amateurs do.
[02:12:05.593 --> 02:12:07.095]  It's what babysitters do.
[02:12:07.095 --> 02:12:08.656]  It's what little girls do.
[02:12:08.656 --> 02:12:14.360]  And when someone isn't well-versed in guns or all these things, they decide they want to play political for a day.
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:15.961]  They want our jobs for a day.
[02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.142]  And they're so bad at it.
[02:12:17.142 --> 02:12:19.984]  Hey, Jimmy, what law would have prevented this?
[02:12:19.984 --> 02:12:21.726]  Tell me how to prevent these.
[02:12:21.726 --> 02:12:25.529]  In his own diatribe, he said, this guy had a clean record.
[02:12:25.529 --> 02:12:26.750]  He was mentally sound.
[02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:30.473]  He gave away that no background check would have stopped this.
[02:12:30.473 --> 02:12:31.594]  And let's expand on that.
[02:12:31.594 --> 02:12:32.515]  It's about the but.
[02:12:32.515 --> 02:12:34.136]  It's about the modification.
[02:12:34.136 --> 02:12:35.617]  Let's make it all about that.
[02:12:35.617 --> 02:12:36.638]  We've tried that.
[02:12:36.638 --> 02:12:37.359]  It doesn't work.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:45.406]  Expanding on that, Gavin, we now have, coming out, the Sheriff saying he clearly was radicalized.
[02:12:45.406 --> 02:12:48.289]  He said he definitely did not do this alone.
[02:12:48.289 --> 02:12:49.630]  These are quotes.
[02:12:49.630 --> 02:12:56.416]  Definitely, they're investigating him for radicalization, which means they found evidence to follow down that trail, but we're hearing nothing.
[02:12:56.416 --> 02:12:58.018]  I think it's absolutely essential
[02:12:58.718 --> 02:12:59.859]  Uh, that that information get out.
[02:12:59.859 --> 02:13:05.281]  The media is spinning it that we on the conservative side, on the libertarian side, are just making up things.
[02:13:05.281 --> 02:13:06.061]  No!
[02:13:06.061 --> 02:13:08.322]  We're going to what we have, the target.
[02:13:08.322 --> 02:13:14.705]  Just like Colonel Schaefer, you know, of Army and CIA intelligence, uh, said the motive is the target.
[02:13:14.705 --> 02:13:22.209]  And it looks just like a replay of a guy the exact same age, uh, going and shooting Congressman Scalise, who wanted to kill the other 14 congressmen as well.
[02:13:23.726 --> 02:13:26.547]  Isn't that a strange word, radicalize?
[02:13:26.547 --> 02:13:36.751]  I mean, they're gonna say, oh he slipped up and he meant it's a radical thing to do, not in a skateboard surfer way, but it's a radical thing to do, to shoot up people, so that's what I meant.
[02:13:36.751 --> 02:13:41.253]  Now, no one ever uses the word radicalize to mean right-winger.
[02:13:41.253 --> 02:13:44.594]  No one says Timothy McVeigh had become radicalized.
[02:13:44.594 --> 02:13:47.195]  Radicalized is reserved for Islam.
[02:13:47.535 --> 02:13:52.999]  So I think the Sheriff screwed up there and accidentally let that word slip, which is going to let Islam slip.
[02:13:52.999 --> 02:13:58.443]  And by the way, I think we can stop differentiating between radical Islam and the alt-left.
[02:13:58.443 --> 02:13:59.844]  Those guys have merged.
[02:13:59.844 --> 02:14:03.948]  Limassar Sur, Rasmaya Odeh, they're running the Women's March.
[02:14:03.948 --> 02:14:12.254]  Radical Islam, Sharia law, and the far left and communism, they're all one big ball and they all have decided the enemy of my enemy is my friend and their enemy is us.
[02:14:12.734 --> 02:14:27.331]  And then the hotel is connected to Care and the Muslim Brotherhood and building casinos in the Middle East and doing donations to it, telling their employees, give George Soros money, give all the usual suspects money, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:14:27.551 --> 02:14:30.752]  Who got caught running the white supremacist compound in Oklahoma City.
[02:14:30.752 --> 02:14:40.657]  I mean just all the usual suspects and five days he's up there with other people putting up cameras and 22 guns and thousands of rounds of ammo.
[02:14:40.657 --> 02:14:46.439]  I mean everybody knows you go to a normal hotel they come in when you're gone and search stuff as a security deal.
[02:14:46.439 --> 02:14:49.521]  At these casinos you're lucky if you don't get a proctology exam.
[02:14:51.485 --> 02:14:55.652]  Well, the devil's in the details, and there's so many tiny details here that don't add up.
[02:14:55.652 --> 02:14:57.474]  Who orders two Pepsis?
[02:14:57.474 --> 02:14:58.817]  Have you ever ordered two Pepsis in your life?
[02:14:58.817 --> 02:15:01.180]  By the way, conservatives don't drink Pepsi.
[02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:03.564]  Everybody knows that, since the last election especially.
[02:15:03.564 --> 02:15:04.706]  That's a Democrat drink.
[02:15:06.067 --> 02:15:06.668]  It is.
[02:15:06.668 --> 02:15:08.950]  It is really, really suspicious.
[02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:10.832]  And I can handle the truth.
[02:15:10.832 --> 02:15:15.036]  I wouldn't be remotely surprised if this guy had converted to Islam.
[02:15:15.036 --> 02:15:20.121]  I wouldn't be remotely surprised if this guy was a left-winger who thought Trump supported Zimbabwe.
[02:15:20.121 --> 02:15:21.862]  By the way, Gavin, ISIS said he did.
[02:15:21.862 --> 02:15:26.287]  And even AP on Monday morning goes, usually ISIS is truthful, what they take credit for.
[02:15:27.611 --> 02:15:30.152]  And they said he converted two months before, maybe for money.
[02:15:30.152 --> 02:15:35.574]  How did he get millions and millions of dollars a year to gamble when he was a private investor?
[02:15:35.574 --> 02:15:37.655]  Let's come right back to Gavin McGinnis.
[02:15:37.655 --> 02:15:41.136]  He's got Get Off My Lawn, the new great broadcast he's launched.

[02:17:23.217 --> 02:17:23.417]  Woo!
[02:17:23.417 --> 02:17:24.458]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:17:24.458 --> 02:17:33.204]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:17:33.204 --> 02:17:42.791]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:17:42.791 --> 02:17:46.233]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:17:46.233 --> 02:17:50.356]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:17:50.356 --> 02:17:51.217]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:17:51.417 --> 02:17:55.420]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:17:55.420 --> 02:18:03.688]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:18:03.688 --> 02:18:04.929]  A 360 win.
[02:18:04.929 --> 02:18:11.474]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:18:11.474 --> 02:18:19.001]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:18:19.401 --> 02:18:24.462]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:30.583]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:18:30.583 --> 02:18:38.365]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:18:38.365 --> 02:18:44.867]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:18:44.867 --> 02:18:46.367]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:18:46.527 --> 02:18:48.974]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:18:48.974 --> 02:18:50.979]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:18:50.979 --> 02:18:54.830]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:00.243]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:19:00.243 --> 02:19:07.988]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:19:07.988 --> 02:19:16.594]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:19:16.594 --> 02:19:21.017]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:19:21.017 --> 02:19:26.180]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:19:26.220 --> 02:19:26.941]  We're good to go.
[02:19:58.579 --> 02:20:01.144]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:10.621 --> 02:20:12.161]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:20:12.161 --> 02:20:14.122]  Adam McGinnis leaves us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:20:14.122 --> 02:20:18.423]  I'm gonna come back and take your phone calls and play that compilation of videos.
[02:20:18.423 --> 02:20:20.704]  Clearly showing two shooters.
[02:20:20.704 --> 02:20:23.765]  And I've interviewed the former head of SEAL Team 6.
[02:20:23.765 --> 02:20:26.205]  He doesn't like me saying that, but that's what he did.
[02:20:26.205 --> 02:20:27.346]  Dev group.
[02:20:27.346 --> 02:20:34.888]  And a bunch of other people currently in Special Operations, Army, highest levels, most elite units, who are assigned to HRT.
[02:20:36.383 --> 02:20:38.064]  And I'm even authorized to say that.
[02:20:38.064 --> 02:20:40.365]  They weren't in the raid, they were behind it.
[02:20:40.365 --> 02:20:42.386]  And the guy shot back at him.
[02:20:42.386 --> 02:20:45.147]  He didn't commit suicide.
[02:20:45.147 --> 02:20:46.908]  And there was Islamic crud everywhere.
[02:20:46.908 --> 02:20:49.909]  And anti for crap all over.
[02:20:49.909 --> 02:20:51.730]  Then I'd ask, well was he set up?
[02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:53.750]  I mean, then I would investigate there.
[02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:55.311]  I wouldn't just pin it on him.
[02:20:55.311 --> 02:20:58.072]  But the fact that they're covering that up, hmm.
[02:20:58.072 --> 02:20:59.013]  As Gavin McGinnis said,
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:04.006]  If it was a conservative, we'd know his whole Facebook history if he visited InfoWars.
[02:21:04.006 --> 02:21:04.406]  We'd know it.
[02:21:04.406 --> 02:21:06.249]  We always get to hear about it.
[02:21:06.249 --> 02:21:08.912]  Even if they were actually leftists that visited our sites.
[02:21:08.912 --> 02:21:11.576]  So Gavin, you're absolutely on target.
[02:21:11.576 --> 02:21:14.059]  May I say I really like your new studio.
[02:21:14.059 --> 02:21:16.062]  That's very, very smart.
[02:21:17.003 --> 02:21:18.765]  What are the other big issues?
[02:21:18.765 --> 02:21:21.046]  I mean, they're trying to frame us all for this.
[02:21:21.046 --> 02:21:22.408]  They're moving forward.
[02:21:22.408 --> 02:21:23.889]  They're trying to give us collective guilt.
[02:21:23.889 --> 02:21:24.930]  You got the NFL thing.
[02:21:24.930 --> 02:21:28.553]  They tried to frame Trump saying that he didn't help Puerto Rico.
[02:21:28.553 --> 02:21:30.774]  We flooded him with mountains of help.
[02:21:30.774 --> 02:21:34.537]  And then the mayor and others got caught with the Teamsters blocking the goods.
[02:21:34.537 --> 02:21:38.120]  I mean, Democrats have gone to such new nasty heights.
[02:21:38.120 --> 02:21:39.301]  I can't even believe it.
[02:21:39.301 --> 02:21:43.265]  But Trump's approval ratings, even in their skewed polls, are skyrocketing.
[02:21:44.085 --> 02:21:48.446]  What next level of lunacy will they go to to try to stop us?
[02:21:48.446 --> 02:21:51.567]  You know, they never cease to amaze me.
[02:21:51.567 --> 02:21:54.748]  After Charlottesville, I went, oh good, I disavowed that.
[02:21:54.748 --> 02:21:55.949]  I'm glad I had nothing to do with it.
[02:21:55.949 --> 02:21:58.470]  And then they go, yeah, but you met someone who was there.
[02:21:58.470 --> 02:22:00.730]  Oh, OK, so now I'm guilty.
[02:22:00.730 --> 02:22:07.613]  Or this thing with the shooting in Vegas, you go, OK, finally.
[02:22:07.613 --> 02:22:09.453]  Gavin's Skype just froze up.
[02:22:09.453 --> 02:22:11.374]  That's kind of cool, all his Skype froze up.
[02:22:12.247 --> 02:22:25.772]  It's like I'm living here in the future, because my TV's HD, and our connection to him on Skype is, oh, it's gone now, was HD, and it looked like he was in a picture window frozen right there.
[02:22:25.772 --> 02:22:33.615]  This HD TV, man, I was at Target a few weeks ago buying something, I forget, party favors for one of my kids.
[02:22:35.199 --> 02:22:39.262]  I don't go to Target often, but I do go to Target even though it's a globalist communist combine.
[02:22:39.262 --> 02:22:41.124]  And they have these new HD TVs in there.
[02:22:41.124 --> 02:22:42.245]  I'm not doing an ad for them.
[02:22:42.245 --> 02:22:48.290]  And they were so HD that it was like I was looking out a window in Spain or in Italy.
[02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:51.212]  And I was like trying to reach through the televisions.
[02:22:51.212 --> 02:22:54.475]  It's just, we are living in science fiction land.
[02:22:54.475 --> 02:22:56.196]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:22:56.196 --> 02:23:00.880]  And how does the establishment think that there wouldn't be any byproducts of all this new communication?
[02:23:01.943 --> 02:23:03.023]  I don't think so.
[02:23:22.268 --> 02:23:26.170]  Again, the force feeding, the desperate establishment, Gavin.
[02:23:26.170 --> 02:23:37.074]  What point have we gotten to where the left is getting so insane and it's only driving people away from them faster?
[02:23:37.074 --> 02:23:40.695]  It's a new studio for Gavin, so we're working out the bugs right now.
[02:23:40.695 --> 02:23:42.996]  Let me see if he can hear me up in New York from here.
[02:23:42.996 --> 02:23:43.937]  GAVIN!
[02:23:43.937 --> 02:23:45.537]  CAN YOU HEAR ME OVER THERE?
[02:23:45.537 --> 02:23:47.058]  IN NEW YORK CITY?
[02:23:47.953 --> 02:23:49.375]  I read you loud and clear!
[02:23:49.375 --> 02:23:49.555]  Good!
[02:23:49.555 --> 02:23:53.340]  We're going to have to hold you over the next segment, so I got more questions for you.
[02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:58.386]  But now that we've worked out the technical difficulties, can you hear me down here from Texas?
[02:23:58.386 --> 02:24:00.729]  Yes, I can hear you up here in New York City.
[02:24:00.729 --> 02:24:01.850]  You sound fine!
[02:24:01.850 --> 02:24:02.191]  Good!
[02:24:02.191 --> 02:24:06.236]  What are they going to do as everyone turns on him and his approval rating skyrocket?
[02:24:07.745 --> 02:24:09.167]  Nothing, they're unflappable.
[02:24:09.167 --> 02:24:18.660]  You know what, I said earlier that they've merged with ISIS, they've merged with the extremist jihadists, and now the alt-left and the radical Islam are as one.
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:20.963]  They're also that way behaviorally.
[02:24:20.963 --> 02:24:22.385]  They're that way ideologically.
[02:24:23.807 --> 02:24:26.790]  ISIS, the Islam is insatiable.
[02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:31.954]  A woman puts on a burqa, she's still getting lashes because part of her bangs are showing, or you can see her socks.
[02:24:31.954 --> 02:24:34.276]  They're never satisfied, Islam.
[02:24:34.276 --> 02:24:37.659]  Similarly, the far left will never ever waver.
[02:24:37.659 --> 02:24:42.423]  The more data they get, the contradicts their belief, the more steadfast they will become in those beliefs.
[02:24:42.423 --> 02:24:46.287]  They see country music fans get murdered because they've been dehumanized.
[02:24:46.807 --> 02:24:49.669]  And they go, that's your fault, that's guns.
[02:24:49.669 --> 02:24:53.632]  No matter what happens, it's more evidence that Trump is Hitler.
[02:24:53.632 --> 02:24:54.973]  So, what do you do?
[02:24:54.973 --> 02:24:56.894]  You do what you do with radical Islam.
[02:24:56.894 --> 02:24:58.035]  You cut them loose.
[02:24:58.035 --> 02:25:00.157]  You say, I'm not talking to you anymore.
[02:25:00.157 --> 02:25:01.498]  You don't have a say.
[02:25:01.498 --> 02:25:02.979]  You're not invited to my party.
[02:25:02.979 --> 02:25:05.601]  Get off my lawn.
[02:25:05.601 --> 02:25:07.902]  And what does your maximum get off my lawn mean?
[02:25:07.902 --> 02:25:10.484]  I mean, I get it in general, but it's a great term.
[02:25:10.484 --> 02:25:12.386]  I mean, does it mean I have my territory?
[02:25:12.386 --> 02:25:13.687]  I can have my own culture?
[02:25:13.687 --> 02:25:15.488]  You can be what you want, but I'm an individual?
[02:25:16.519 --> 02:25:21.960]  Yes, it means if you're here to enrich my life, then by all means, welcome aboard.
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:28.922]  But if you're here to mess with me, if you're here to sabotage the patriarchy or capitalism or the West, get lost!
[02:25:28.922 --> 02:25:31.063]  Get off my lawn!
[02:25:31.063 --> 02:25:41.626]  Walt Kowalski says it in Gran Torino, and I just thought, what a perfect example of how great America used to be, where we used to be proud of our lawns, where dads used to be the boss.
[02:25:41.626 --> 02:25:44.967]  Now we've got Homer Simpson with his hand stuck in a toaster going,
[02:25:46.631 --> 02:25:49.026]  I want to get back to people revering the patriarch.
[02:25:50.396 --> 02:26:03.205]  I've got to say, uh, I was once for a costume party, I guess around Halloween, uh, the guy from Falling Down, but I think you're channeling, you know, somebody that would work at, say, IBM or Texas Instruments in 1984.
[02:26:03.205 --> 02:26:05.906]  That is quite the outfit you're wearing.
[02:26:05.906 --> 02:26:15.853]  In fact, before you even kind of went with that, I was trying to get, uh, Owen Schroeder, because he can pull it off, I said, I want the most right-wing, outlandish rep ties.
[02:26:15.853 --> 02:26:20.316]  I want huge American flag lapels, because it triggers them, and, but I said, think
[02:26:21.337 --> 02:26:27.260]  Think even like a fancy version of the guy from Falling Down and you've done it!
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:33.403]  Well I just re-watched that movie actually and he is an awesome character but I forgot how badly he treats his ex-wife.
[02:26:34.102 --> 02:26:35.783]  He's a real jerk to her.
[02:26:35.783 --> 02:26:37.884]  That's that's not what I'm going for.
[02:26:37.884 --> 02:26:41.385]  But outside of that, yeah, I like this guy who's mad as hell.
[02:26:41.385 --> 02:26:46.127]  I'm not going to take it anymore because it's been decades of me sitting with liberals.
[02:26:46.127 --> 02:26:47.327]  I live in New York City.
[02:26:47.327 --> 02:26:49.989]  So I sit with him and I go, OK, tell me what goes.
[02:26:49.989 --> 02:26:51.149]  What do they do when you wear that outfit?
[02:26:51.289 --> 02:26:52.030]  Because here's the deal.
[02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:54.474]  Everything they do is so uncool, so rejected.
[02:26:54.474 --> 02:26:55.054]  I agree.
[02:26:55.054 --> 02:26:58.119]  The coolest thing to be now is what you're wearing.
[02:26:58.119 --> 02:26:59.941]  In fact, I'm too fat to pull it off.
[02:26:59.941 --> 02:27:00.382]  Too big.
[02:27:00.382 --> 02:27:03.666]  But that's... I think everybody should start dressing just like that.
[02:27:03.666 --> 02:27:06.651]  Just to let folks know, we reject your establishment garbage.
[02:27:07.574 --> 02:27:09.175]  Conservative is the new punk.
[02:27:09.175 --> 02:27:12.257]  It's now radical to say, I like traditionalism.
[02:27:12.257 --> 02:27:14.138]  I think most women would be happier at home.
[02:27:14.138 --> 02:27:17.540]  I think that they should follow the law when it comes to immigration.
[02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:23.263]  Now to have your dad's views, which in a tavern 30 years ago were just mundane.
[02:27:23.263 --> 02:27:25.765]  I mean, you wouldn't even say that because it's so obvious.
[02:27:25.765 --> 02:27:27.026]  Yes, I love America.
[02:27:27.026 --> 02:27:30.548]  No, I don't want it ruined with different cultures diluting it.
[02:27:30.548 --> 02:27:35.611]  But now when you say something that's just normal, it's considered remarkably radical.
[02:27:36.391 --> 02:27:43.584]  Well, my thing is America's always been about a bunch of cultures together, but they were coming to get away from oppression and trying to make something better.
[02:27:43.584 --> 02:27:47.251]  Now other groups are brought in to be turned against America by the globalists.
[02:27:47.251 --> 02:27:48.172]  That's why it's a problem.
[02:27:49.233 --> 02:27:51.215]  You know, Britain is a perfect example of that.
[02:27:51.215 --> 02:27:52.896]  That is the canary in the coal mine.
[02:27:52.896 --> 02:27:54.998]  And you have, what's his name, Sadiq Khan?
[02:27:54.998 --> 02:27:57.760]  I always confuse him with the British editor at Breitbart.
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:01.083]  But, he said, immigrants don't have to assimilate.
[02:28:01.083 --> 02:28:04.366]  And he also said, terrorism is just part of living in a big city.
[02:28:04.366 --> 02:28:09.310]  So you combine those two, and you have the opposite of what the West was all about.
[02:28:09.310 --> 02:28:14.194]  It was, I don't care who you are, if you're here and you're on board with freedom, let's do this.
[02:28:14.933 --> 02:28:17.175]  And it's been working for centuries.
[02:28:17.175 --> 02:28:21.638]  And all of a sudden, in the past, I would even say five years, we've said, you know what?
[02:28:21.638 --> 02:28:24.020]  Let's just burn the whole thing to the ground.
[02:28:24.020 --> 02:28:25.901]  And that's what I think happened in Vegas.
[02:28:25.901 --> 02:28:29.804]  I think a big part of that attack was this dehumanization.
[02:28:29.804 --> 02:28:32.085]  You know, Charles Krautheimer says, they think we're evil.
[02:28:32.085 --> 02:28:33.466]  We just think they're wrong.
[02:28:33.466 --> 02:28:35.508]  They think that we are like demons.
[02:28:35.988 --> 02:28:38.751]  And they want to blast us and kill us.
[02:28:38.751 --> 02:28:41.913]  They want to make them victims, which they are, and they use it to get the guns.
[02:28:41.913 --> 02:28:44.856]  But simultaneously, all these liberals are celebrating their deaths.
[02:28:44.856 --> 02:28:46.117]  Let's come back and do five more minutes.
[02:28:46.117 --> 02:28:49.220]  I want to ask you, what happens if they assassinate President Trump?
[02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:51.762]  Let's get serious with Gavin McInnes, then your phone calls.
[02:28:54.318 --> 02:28:56.199]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:28:56.199 --> 02:28:58.239]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:28:58.239 --> 02:29:01.141]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:29:01.141 --> 02:29:07.203]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:29:07.203 --> 02:29:16.386]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.

[02:29:23.913 --> 02:29:31.969]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:32.930]  The general public doesn't.
[02:29:34.142 --> 02:29:38.067]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:29:38.067 --> 02:29:41.651]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:29:41.651 --> 02:29:48.360]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[02:32:58.580 --> 02:33:01.221]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.526 --> 02:33:09.347]  You wanna talk about Twilight Zone?
[02:33:09.347 --> 02:33:10.728]  Guess who just called me during the break.
[02:33:10.728 --> 02:33:11.669]  I'm not name-dropping.
[02:33:11.669 --> 02:33:12.969]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:33:12.969 --> 02:33:13.250]  Ha!
[02:33:13.250 --> 02:33:14.510]  Not gonna believe it.
[02:33:22.091 --> 02:33:22.812]  Hi, Alex.
[02:33:22.812 --> 02:33:24.653]  It's Dr. Phil.
[02:33:24.653 --> 02:33:27.914]  That Dr. Phil calling me when I'm on the show.
[02:33:27.914 --> 02:33:39.760]  You know, it's gone from like 10 years ago, kind of hokey and stupid going on mainstream TV shows, to now you never see me on them because I won't do it because they're so uncool.
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:40.680]  Now let me explain.
[02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:43.421]  I'm not trying to act cool.
[02:33:43.421 --> 02:33:45.602]  I'm dressing the same way I dressed 30 years ago.
[02:33:45.602 --> 02:33:46.243]  I just want to be
[02:33:47.432 --> 02:33:57.435]  Left alone to live my own life, just like Gavin, who's been a very successful comedian, filmmaker, writer, found advice that got bought by HBO.
[02:33:57.435 --> 02:34:00.036]  And as he said before, he's been ostracized.
[02:34:00.036 --> 02:34:06.498]  He's been kicked out of his entire circle of friends like they're a cult.
[02:34:06.498 --> 02:34:11.379]  You hear about these cults where you don't agree with them, they say, sorry, I can't talk to you anymore.
[02:34:11.379 --> 02:34:12.760]  Well, that's what Democrats are like.
[02:34:15.416 --> 02:34:19.178]  Areas downtown of Austin, which has been colonized by failures from California.
[02:34:19.178 --> 02:34:20.478]  I don't mean all of California is bad.
[02:34:20.478 --> 02:34:22.519]  You know the failures that went to California and failed.
[02:34:22.519 --> 02:34:26.421]  They're like moths or locusts.
[02:34:26.421 --> 02:34:31.343]  They've now come here and they'll run up and scream and cuss at me and throw things at me.
[02:34:31.343 --> 02:34:35.985]  People have seen live feeds where I'm just walking down the street, people are driving by going, F you, F you.
[02:34:35.985 --> 02:34:43.528]  Now, for every person that does that, five or six wave at me, want to shake my hand, of every color, of every creed, of every male, female, gay, straight, you name it.
[02:34:44.923 --> 02:34:49.585]  But they're just so intolerant and cancelling Berkeley that he was going to speak at.
[02:34:49.585 --> 02:34:52.166]  But then Antifa can march the next day.
[02:34:52.166 --> 02:34:55.348]  And now Alan Dershowitz is going to sue them because they won't let him speak.
[02:34:55.348 --> 02:35:01.951]  And just the evil of these people, and they're ratcheting up the rhetoric, saying we're going to kill Trump, we're going to kill his family, we're going to kill his supporters.
[02:35:01.951 --> 02:35:04.072]  And I've had them dump hot coffee on me.
[02:35:04.072 --> 02:35:06.433]  And you scream Nazi while they do it.
[02:35:06.433 --> 02:35:08.134]  They want a coming-of-age war.
[02:35:08.934 --> 02:35:11.977]  And so what happens if they kill President Trump?
[02:35:11.977 --> 02:35:16.260]  They're foiling plots, reportedly, every few days right now that you really don't hear about.
[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:18.882]  Some of them come out, but I've got Secret Service sources.
[02:35:18.882 --> 02:35:20.243]  I mean, it is insane.
[02:35:20.243 --> 02:35:26.388]  They're having to spend three times what they did on Obama because it's just coming out of the woodwork and the President's not a coward, he's out there.
[02:35:26.388 --> 02:35:30.552]  But what happens, Gavin McInnes, syndicated TV host, what happens?
[02:35:31.576 --> 02:35:34.197]  On CRTV, doing great stuff.
[02:35:34.197 --> 02:35:37.359]  What happens if the president is killed?
[02:35:37.359 --> 02:35:44.963]  Because I'm really concerned that the deep state who says they want an upheaval, they want a revolution to stop the populist peaceful awakening.
[02:35:45.919 --> 02:35:51.401]  To derail this political realignment, that it's in the calculus.
[02:35:51.401 --> 02:35:55.662]  They've had former Deputy Director of the CIA say, we're going to kill the President on CNN.
[02:35:55.662 --> 02:35:56.762]  That's a clear threat.
[02:35:56.762 --> 02:35:59.743]  They're clearly trying to line that up right now.
[02:35:59.743 --> 02:36:01.744]  What happens if they kill 45?
[02:36:03.766 --> 02:36:08.349]  First of all, isn't it amazing how mainstream that question has become?
[02:36:08.349 --> 02:36:15.073]  It's on CNN all the time, it comes up on mainstream media all the time, like it's a perfectly normal thing.
[02:36:15.073 --> 02:36:24.719]  Meanwhile, back in Obama's days, we have one rodeo clown dares to dress up like him, the guy's fired, you never mock the president, don't you dare make fun of him.
[02:36:24.719 --> 02:36:27.021]  Yet we can discuss Trump's murder.
[02:36:27.021 --> 02:36:28.402]  It's just, it's just accepted.
[02:36:29.202 --> 02:36:40.410]  On November 4th, there's a massive riot planned by Antifa, where they want to shut down the entire country, burn it to the ground, and part of that is to either have Trump leave or be killed.
[02:36:40.410 --> 02:36:45.653]  And they don't seem to understand that Pence is more Republican and right-wing than Trump is.
[02:36:45.653 --> 02:36:54.319]  So you'd have to kill Trump and the Vice President, and if you even try to do that, you are going to wake the sleeping giant.
[02:36:54.319 --> 02:36:57.701]  America is pretty annoyed with the left, but they're busy people.
[02:36:57.921 --> 02:37:05.608]  You know, even those country fans at the Jason Aldean concert, only 60% are political people who consider themselves right-wing.
[02:37:05.608 --> 02:37:07.470]  Only 11% are liberal.
[02:37:07.470 --> 02:37:08.691]  30% are just not political.
[02:37:08.691 --> 02:37:17.159]  But if you start messing with a democratically elected president, you are going to regret it, is what's going to happen.
[02:37:17.159 --> 02:37:19.942]  And America is going to come down on the left hard.
[02:37:22.090 --> 02:37:32.818]  Well, that's what they're trying to package, and just like Hillary thought she was invincible, and all these other guys thought they were, but they keep getting their butts handed to them, don't they understand that it's 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[02:37:32.818 --> 02:37:34.419]  That they're playing chess here?
[02:37:34.419 --> 02:37:35.740]  That there'll be aftermath?
[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:43.045]  Because so many of their decisions, they just make like they're a three-year-old sticking their hand in the cookie jar, or peeing in the pool.
[02:37:43.045 --> 02:37:46.168]  They don't think about what's going to come as a repercussion.
[02:37:46.168 --> 02:37:47.749]  That, to me, is most frightening of all.
[02:37:49.151 --> 02:37:52.734]  It's almost like there's a pop star you don't like, like Katy Perry.
[02:37:52.734 --> 02:37:54.475]  And you go, I don't want her around.
[02:37:54.475 --> 02:37:57.276]  And then you just ruin her career, and then she'll be gone.
[02:37:57.276 --> 02:37:59.078]  Trump isn't just Trump.
[02:37:59.078 --> 02:38:00.519]  Trump is an idea.
[02:38:00.519 --> 02:38:03.861]  And that idea is, let's be proud of America again.
[02:38:03.861 --> 02:38:07.483]  Let's accept the fact that we are the best country in the world.
[02:38:07.483 --> 02:38:10.345]  And voters went, yep, I'm all for trying that.
[02:38:10.345 --> 02:38:13.127]  I tried We Suck for eight years, it didn't go well.
[02:38:13.127 --> 02:38:14.908]  So if you think you can kill Trump,
[02:38:15.328 --> 02:38:22.933]  You also think you can kill that idea, the idea that America kicks ass, and America will kick your ass if you try that.
[02:38:22.933 --> 02:38:25.515]  By the way, we're the ones that are good with guns, not them.
[02:38:25.515 --> 02:38:42.606]  That's what they've already tried, is saying, the NRA is terrorists, and then the next night, gun owners are terrorists, you're in dirty business, you're bad, people are rejecting it, so Kimmel and his speech writers don't get, don't they understand, like, you can press somebody that's asleep, or press somebody you got whipped,
[02:38:43.566 --> 02:38:46.887]  What they're doing to us is not whipping us, it's enraging us.
[02:38:46.887 --> 02:38:49.448]  No one I know is buying this.
[02:38:49.448 --> 02:38:52.789]  Well, that's why Trump was elected, by the way.
[02:38:52.789 --> 02:38:58.371]  For 25 years, us dads have been sitting on the couch, and when the polling station calls, we go, I'm busy.
[02:38:58.371 --> 02:39:01.672]  And when it's time for the election, we go, it's all fixed anyway, screw it.
[02:39:01.672 --> 02:39:08.014]  And then, this election came along, and we saw Trump, and for the first time in 25 years, dads put down their beer, they said, hold my beer,
[02:39:08.394 --> 02:39:10.215]  And they walked to the polling station.
[02:39:10.215 --> 02:39:14.739]  And, conversely, women went, I hate Hillary, I'm done with this.
[02:39:14.739 --> 02:39:16.300]  And women stayed on the couch.
[02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:18.702]  So in a way, we've already awoken the sleeping giant.
[02:39:18.702 --> 02:39:21.444]  And these dads have gotten off their ass and voted.
[02:39:21.444 --> 02:39:24.506]  And instead of going, whoa, I got dad mad.
[02:39:24.506 --> 02:39:27.908]  Like at home, when dad's mad, the whole house can feel it.
[02:39:27.908 --> 02:39:30.170]  But now the kids are still being brats.
[02:39:30.170 --> 02:39:34.353]  They're still nagging and pulling at dad's slacks after he already got up.
[02:39:34.773 --> 02:39:36.495]  You're gonna get more than sent to your room.
[02:39:36.495 --> 02:39:38.497]  You're gonna get swatted upside the head.
[02:39:38.497 --> 02:39:41.500]  Look at the NFL thing.
[02:39:42.574 --> 02:39:43.995]  First, they come out.
[02:39:43.995 --> 02:39:45.436]  The president says you should be respectful.
[02:39:45.436 --> 02:39:45.896]  This is rude.
[02:39:45.896 --> 02:39:48.338]  They go, no, you're disrespectful to the NRA.
[02:39:48.338 --> 02:39:50.180]  Within days, they had to back off.
[02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:51.921]  But still, people are leaving them in droves.
[02:39:51.921 --> 02:39:53.662]  The NBA had to back off.
[02:39:53.662 --> 02:39:55.944]  Again, everything they do, they're losing at.
[02:39:55.944 --> 02:39:58.145]  But like you said, they're like undead zombies.
[02:39:58.145 --> 02:39:59.206]  They never stop coming.
[02:39:59.206 --> 02:40:00.647]  They're just brains!
[02:40:00.647 --> 02:40:01.628]  Freedom!
[02:40:01.628 --> 02:40:03.449]  We want North Korea!
[02:40:03.449 --> 02:40:03.789]  No!
[02:40:03.789 --> 02:40:05.350]  We don't want the stock market up!
[02:40:05.350 --> 02:40:05.651]  No!
[02:40:05.651 --> 02:40:07.312]  We don't want a growing economy!
[02:40:07.312 --> 02:40:08.593]  No!
[02:40:08.593 --> 02:40:09.593]  No!
[02:40:09.593 --> 02:40:10.534]  Failure!
[02:40:10.534 --> 02:40:11.355]  We want to fail!
[02:40:12.734 --> 02:40:21.420]  It's like that drunk guy at the party who just ruins every conversation, and then he knocks something over, and then he's trying to change the song, and he just goes, and scrapes the record.
[02:40:21.420 --> 02:40:22.321]  That's what the left is.
[02:40:22.321 --> 02:40:24.142]  They go and they ruin video games.
[02:40:24.142 --> 02:40:25.963]  They ruin movies.
[02:40:25.963 --> 02:40:27.104]  They ruin heavy metal.
[02:40:27.104 --> 02:40:28.745]  They're trying to make that politically correct.
[02:40:28.745 --> 02:40:31.047]  And you go, well, at least sports is a meritocracy.
[02:40:31.047 --> 02:40:33.449]  If you can throw a fastball at 100 miles an hour, you're in.
[02:40:33.449 --> 02:40:35.871]  I don't care if you're a reptilian, you're in.
[02:40:35.871 --> 02:40:37.472]  And they go, no, we're ruining sports.
[02:40:37.472 --> 02:40:39.993]  We're making sports about being politically correct.
[02:40:39.993 --> 02:40:40.454]  And you just go,
[02:40:41.094 --> 02:40:44.316]  Is there nothing that you don't want to ruin?
[02:40:44.316 --> 02:40:49.578]  They've ruined jokes, they've ruined sex, they've ruined dating.
[02:40:49.578 --> 02:40:52.039]  What's left?
[02:40:52.039 --> 02:41:07.727]  And then they love authoritarian Islam and want to ally with that, but then they think men in the house wearing pants is bad, but throwing acid on women's faces, so much so they're trying to ban precursors to acid and having acid control in London because they're having seven attacks a day melting women's faces off.
[02:41:09.798 --> 02:41:14.163]  I'm sorry to laugh, but it's just they've chosen the most bizarre bedfellows.
[02:41:14.163 --> 02:41:25.715]  They're calling us racist, sexist, homophobes, and embracing jihadists who throw gays off buildings, treat women as second-class citizens, and racism, I mean, that's not even a thing to them.
[02:41:25.715 --> 02:41:31.982]  It's such a given that they are superior, more superior than anyone else, that racism is just, that's an obvious one.
[02:41:32.362 --> 02:41:37.226]  So, I mean, I think they abolished slavery in Saudi Arabia in, like, 2010.
[02:41:37.226 --> 02:41:38.908]  And you know it's not abolished.
[02:41:38.908 --> 02:41:40.149]  Well, Gavin, we're out of time.
[02:41:40.149 --> 02:41:47.234]  Folks, you can find more on your Twitter, on CRTV, and the great work that all you guys are doing over there.
[02:41:47.234 --> 02:41:48.375]  Gavin underscore McGinnis.
[02:41:48.375 --> 02:41:50.017]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:41:50.017 --> 02:41:51.418]  Follow me on RealAlexJones.
[02:41:51.418 --> 02:41:58.724]  But I noticed in closing, you got Paul Watson behind you tweeting about Drudge, sheriff, saying that the shooter may have been radicalized
[02:41:59.224 --> 02:42:03.107]  Yes, Media Matters, as you pointed out, run by Soros, says that's fake news.
[02:42:03.107 --> 02:42:09.592]  No, the sheriff said that, and says there's no way... I heard it with my ears!
[02:42:09.592 --> 02:42:09.772]  Yeah.
[02:42:09.772 --> 02:42:11.513]  So what do you make of the arrogance of them?
[02:42:11.513 --> 02:42:13.855]  I mean, they're the ones putting out fake news.
[02:42:14.858 --> 02:42:24.063]  You know, when you have these apocalypse cults, and they say the world's gonna end October 13th, uh, 2017, and you go, well, on October 14th, that'll be the end of that cult, right?
[02:42:24.063 --> 02:42:26.924]  And then October 14th rolls around and they have more members!
[02:42:26.924 --> 02:42:29.946]  And you realize, liberalism is a cult.
[02:42:29.946 --> 02:42:33.327]  Country music fans can get murdered to the tune of, what is it, 58 now?
[02:42:33.327 --> 02:42:34.328]  Yep.
[02:42:34.328 --> 02:42:36.309]  And it's GOP's fault.
[02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:38.010]  It's the Republicans' fault.
[02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:43.272]  No matter what happens, if there's a flood, it's Trump's, uh, views on global warming.
[02:42:43.272 --> 02:42:44.173]  It's Trump's fault.
[02:42:44.813 --> 02:42:47.854]  I'm at the point now where I'm not arguing with these Scientologists anymore.
[02:42:47.854 --> 02:42:48.754]  I'm done with this cult.
[02:42:48.754 --> 02:42:49.474]  That's right, Gavin.
[02:42:49.474 --> 02:42:49.915]  Thank you.
[02:42:49.915 --> 02:42:50.955]  Call straight ahead.
[02:42:50.955 --> 02:42:51.355]  Stay with us.
[02:42:51.355 --> 02:42:54.376]  Thank you, Gavin.
[02:42:54.376 --> 02:43:04.979]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:43:04.979 --> 02:43:07.040]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:09.900]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:11.401]  It's made in the USA.
[02:43:11.401 --> 02:43:11.501]  It's
[02:43:11.741 --> 02:43:12.681]  We're good to go.
[02:43:35.089 --> 02:43:46.824]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:43:46.824 --> 02:43:50.128]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:43:50.128 --> 02:43:53.472]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:54.073 --> 02:44:03.161]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:44:03.161 --> 02:44:11.288]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:44:11.548 --> 02:44:16.430]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:44:16.430 --> 02:44:23.233]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:23.233 --> 02:44:30.396]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:44:30.396 --> 02:44:37.439]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:44:37.439 --> 02:44:39.760]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two,
[02:44:40.180 --> 02:44:41.903]  I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:44:41.903 --> 02:44:45.309]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:44:45.309 --> 02:44:47.192]  You will be supporting a free press.

[02:45:44.486 --> 02:45:45.929]  That means it's clean.
[02:45:45.929 --> 02:45:47.071]  That means it's pure.
[02:45:47.071 --> 02:45:49.976]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.

[02:46:58.050 --> 02:47:06.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:06.013 --> 02:47:15.137]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[02:47:16.721 --> 02:47:19.804]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast.
[02:47:19.804 --> 02:47:21.326]  But we're miles above them.
[02:47:21.326 --> 02:47:23.428]  On our journey to hell.
[02:47:23.428 --> 02:47:34.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:34.060 --> 02:47:36.262]  Coming down fast!
[02:47:36.262 --> 02:47:38.224]  But I'm miles above you!
[02:47:38.224 --> 02:47:38.425]  Yeah!
[02:47:48.739 --> 02:47:50.567]  We are live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:47:52.512 --> 02:47:53.333]  Why do I play this?
[02:47:53.333 --> 02:47:57.975]  Because the globalist that they're bringing in to help us shelter, that's Charlie Manson.
[02:47:57.975 --> 02:48:02.498]  A virtual army of unidentified assassins.
[02:48:02.498 --> 02:48:05.900]  A plan that the Weathermen wanted to carry out.
[02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:08.301]  A plan that people like Charlie Manson dreamed of.
[02:48:08.301 --> 02:48:11.523]  Going out and killing all the squares, man.
[02:48:11.523 --> 02:48:17.407]  All the judges and all the politicians and all the rich people and taking over the world, man.
[02:48:19.077 --> 02:48:24.118]  What it really was going to be is a French Revolution to make something even worse!
[02:48:24.118 --> 02:48:29.080]  And now the globalists themselves have used this to overturn other countries, other nations.
[02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:42.023]  And that's why they got all the cop-killing operations going, just beta-testing how the police will respond, instead of a cop getting shot in the back of the head, you know, randomly, by one of Soros' minions every day or so, or every week.
[02:48:42.023 --> 02:48:42.843]  It'll be every hour!
[02:48:44.653 --> 02:48:51.038]  And then see if you'll sign on to the UN and Total Global Control via the Strong Cities Initiative, then they'll stop killing you.
[02:48:51.038 --> 02:48:52.338]  People say, man, that sounds crazy.
[02:48:52.338 --> 02:48:54.660]  But it's true!
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:57.822]  Type in Loretta Lynch, Strong Cities, and all the rest of the initiatives.
[02:48:57.822 --> 02:48:59.524]  It's happening.
[02:48:59.524 --> 02:49:02.406]  You know who they put on the police review boards?
[02:49:02.406 --> 02:49:07.329]  Marxist, Leninist, Communist, Mao Brigade members.
[02:49:07.329 --> 02:49:08.270]  Right here where I live!
[02:49:11.909 --> 02:49:15.550]  And you're like, okay, the cops aren't perfect, but I'm not with the Mal Brigade.
[02:49:15.550 --> 02:49:19.372]  It's real simple.
[02:49:19.372 --> 02:49:26.735]  And we're trying to make America free and open again, but not by globalist terms, where they overrun and destroy the nation.
[02:49:26.735 --> 02:49:33.458]  I'm going to write your calls, Karen and Lexi and Ian and Josh and others that are patiently holding.
[02:49:33.458 --> 02:49:34.938]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:49:38.649 --> 02:49:48.557]  I'm not going to belabor this, but we've gone out and private labeled or in some cases developed the very best nutraceuticals out there with four of the top companies in the U.S.
[02:49:48.557 --> 02:49:58.264]  Brain Force takes all that's known about nootropics or brain pills that are natural and healthy and basically gives you what's in other leading brands that are $50, $60, $70 for $30.
[02:49:58.264 --> 02:49:59.145]  That's when we discount it.
[02:49:59.145 --> 02:50:00.406]  Normally it's like $20.
[02:50:05.306 --> 02:50:11.872]  35, 36, but right now it's $19.96, 50% off the regular price.
[02:50:11.872 --> 02:50:12.933]  We've never done that.
[02:50:12.933 --> 02:50:14.434]  We've got a huge shipment in.
[02:50:14.434 --> 02:50:16.076]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:50:16.076 --> 02:50:22.342]  I want you to try it and see how good it is and how it doesn't give me a hangover or make me jittery like some of the other nootropics out there do.
[02:50:22.782 --> 02:50:25.683]  If you're into energy drinks and all that other stuff, you really owe it to yourself.
[02:50:25.683 --> 02:50:28.425]  Because a lot of the energy drink makers say they wouldn't drink it themselves.
[02:50:28.425 --> 02:50:29.605]  I take this myself.
[02:50:29.605 --> 02:50:30.746]  It's really good for you.
[02:50:30.746 --> 02:50:31.826]  It's high quality.
[02:50:31.826 --> 02:50:33.027]  Infowarslife.com, 888-253-3139.
[02:50:37.824 --> 02:50:38.404]  I don't know.
[02:50:53.616 --> 02:51:00.400]  But that is getting ready to be close to selling out, so I'm going to go ahead and bring it back to its regular price in the next few days.
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:01.860]  So take advantage of that.
[02:51:01.860 --> 02:51:02.881]  That special's about to end.
[02:51:02.881 --> 02:51:05.382]  Secret 12, 40% off, about to end.
[02:51:05.382 --> 02:51:05.923]  25% off.
[02:51:05.923 --> 02:51:07.704]  Oxy Powder to flush out your guts.
[02:51:07.704 --> 02:51:08.484]  That's 25% off.
[02:51:08.484 --> 02:51:09.124]  Amazing.
[02:51:09.124 --> 02:51:12.506]  Alexa Pure Water Filtration System, 20% off.
[02:51:12.506 --> 02:51:13.627]  That's already off the low price.
[02:51:14.367 --> 02:51:16.168]  Emrix Essentials right now.
[02:51:16.168 --> 02:51:17.268]  Essential oils are in.
[02:51:17.268 --> 02:51:18.649]  Those are discounted as well.
[02:51:18.649 --> 02:51:19.809]  Very high quality.
[02:51:19.809 --> 02:51:20.749]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:51:20.749 --> 02:51:21.590]  Air purification.
[02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:22.870]  Already super low price.
[02:51:22.870 --> 02:51:24.170]  It's normally 200-something bucks.
[02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:25.931]  The competitor's like 500.
[02:51:25.931 --> 02:51:27.712]  And this is the same type unit.
[02:51:27.712 --> 02:51:29.812]  They just mark it up massively.
[02:51:29.812 --> 02:51:30.753]  So this is 20% off.
[02:51:30.753 --> 02:51:31.673]  It's just an incredible deal.
[02:51:31.673 --> 02:51:32.133]  It's up to $200.
[02:51:32.133 --> 02:51:33.674]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:51:38.993 --> 02:51:40.474]  And you're the folks that make it possible.
[02:51:40.474 --> 02:51:44.497]  Without you supporting us financially and buying great products at great prices, we don't exist.
[02:51:44.497 --> 02:51:51.882]  So no, when you fund InfoWars, our success is your success, and you get great products, a 360 win.
[02:51:51.882 --> 02:51:57.887]  Okay, we got Karen, we got Lexi, we got Ian, we got Jesse, we got Josh, we got a lot of folks.
[02:51:57.887 --> 02:52:00.268]  Karen in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:52:00.268 --> 02:52:01.829]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:01.829 --> 02:52:02.890]  Hello, Alex.
[02:52:02.890 --> 02:52:03.931]  Hi.
[02:52:03.931 --> 02:52:04.992]  Hey, you rock.
[02:52:04.992 --> 02:52:07.253]  Okay, I got three quick questions for you.
[02:52:08.368 --> 02:52:11.068]  This man was supposed to have a plane, correct?
[02:52:11.068 --> 02:52:15.889]  Why didn't he fill that up and go shoot somebody, you know, like go and kill everybody with that?
[02:52:15.889 --> 02:52:20.030]  Because that would have been a lot more if he was a lone wolf type person.
[02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:25.211]  You know, that would have done a lot more damage than the supposedly the guns at that distance.
[02:52:25.211 --> 02:52:26.911]  What do you think of that?
[02:52:26.911 --> 02:52:28.692]  The whole thing is perfect to be covered up.
[02:52:28.692 --> 02:52:35.453]  And I don't know how you get 20 plus guns and thousands of rounds of ammo into a deal for five days and they don't learn about it.
[02:52:35.453 --> 02:52:35.713]  Where is
[02:52:37.355 --> 02:52:38.076]  I've talked to folks.
[02:52:38.076 --> 02:52:41.403]  You leave a marijuana cigarette in your bag, they find it, hotel security comes.
[02:52:41.403 --> 02:52:43.607]  The hotels all search your stuff, folks.
[02:52:43.607 --> 02:52:45.350]  And they do it even more at the casinos.
[02:52:45.350 --> 02:52:46.372]  This is pure bull.
[02:52:46.372 --> 02:52:48.316]  Again, one of my security people...
[02:52:49.181 --> 02:52:51.162]  Years ago he was pulling security in Vegas.
[02:52:51.162 --> 02:52:57.666]  He even had the special license via the barcode and serial number you're supposed to have with whatever company you're with.
[02:52:57.666 --> 02:53:04.189]  Very strict gun laws in the city and in the county there where Vegas is located, not so much in the state itself.
[02:53:04.189 --> 02:53:09.572]  He went down for an hour to eat something, came back up, his gun was gone out of the underwear drawer.
[02:53:09.572 --> 02:53:12.614]  He called them, they said please come down to the
[02:53:13.513 --> 02:53:14.493]  Downstairs area.
[02:53:14.493 --> 02:53:15.614]  He was there three hours.
[02:53:15.614 --> 02:53:26.378]  They were going to take him to jail until the security company brought his security license to be an armed security personnel with the code.
[02:53:26.378 --> 02:53:29.739]  So they search your room when you leave.
[02:53:29.739 --> 02:53:30.399]  It's a fact.
[02:53:30.399 --> 02:53:31.699]  It is a setup.
[02:53:31.699 --> 02:53:33.760]  The company is involved with jihadis.
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:41.223]  I'm not saying they did the whole thing, but they clearly had sympathizers, and that's why you hear the cops using the word radicalized, which is code for Islam.
[02:53:41.223 --> 02:53:41.503]  Go ahead.
[02:53:42.418 --> 02:53:42.959]  Well, all I know is...
[02:54:05.578 --> 02:54:06.719]  She had two different husbands.
[02:54:06.719 --> 02:54:09.620]  This whole thing, it's gun running, it's drugs.
[02:54:09.620 --> 02:54:10.761]  I mean, you can just see it.
[02:54:10.761 --> 02:54:14.943]  He was spending millions a year and they were going, oh, he's winning at the casinos.
[02:54:14.943 --> 02:54:20.667]  No one wins unless they bring $100,000 in the front and then leave with $60,000 or $70,000.
[02:54:20.667 --> 02:54:24.849]  That's the only way you win is laundering money and it's well known.
[02:54:24.849 --> 02:54:26.230]  Thank you so much for the call, Karen.
[02:54:26.230 --> 02:54:27.510]  Great point.
[02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:32.093]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jesse in Canada.
[02:54:32.093 --> 02:54:32.954]  You're on the air, Jesse.
[02:54:32.954 --> 02:54:33.454]  Thanks for holding.
[02:54:34.618 --> 02:54:36.619]  Hey, every minute was worth it, Alex.
[02:54:36.619 --> 02:54:50.787]  I actually have, one big question I have here is, you know, so if he went and he bought all of these guns and all this ammunition in what, like the five days he was there?
[02:54:50.787 --> 02:54:58.671]  And he has no prehistory of that or the fact that he was... Well, now they're saying he bought the guns years ago, but there's no record of most of that too.
[02:54:58.671 --> 02:55:00.192]  The whole thing is just ridiculous.
[02:55:00.192 --> 02:55:01.132]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:55:01.132 --> 02:55:02.393]  So like, I could go to Tim,
[02:55:03.291 --> 02:55:08.068]  For like Tim Horton's up here for like a couple of months straight and I go to Starbucks
[02:55:08.812 --> 02:55:19.120]  And I get a call because they think someone's using my credit card, but this guy all of a sudden decides to go and start buying, like, Arsenal, the AR-15s, and thousands around.
[02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:20.481]  That's right, that's right.
[02:55:20.481 --> 02:55:35.654]  I buy probably 10 guns a year, but they know who I am, they know I'm a collector, but I also have some of the guns here for security personnel, and I just, I'm a collector, so I've never been red flagged, but anybody that goes in and is out of the blue, starts buying 20, 30 guns in a year, you get a visit.
[02:55:38.359 --> 02:55:39.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:47.853]  And the other interesting thing I was thinking about is, uh, what kind of, did they say what the make of the vehicle was that he came into?
[02:55:47.853 --> 02:55:54.262]  Because there's no way he's got all of that loaded into, like, a basic Ford or... Sir, normal hotels.
[02:55:55.638 --> 02:55:59.524]  Normal hotels rifle through your stuff.
[02:55:59.524 --> 02:56:03.449]  I'll have prescription pills on me that aren't even a controlled substance.
[02:56:03.449 --> 02:56:06.694]  And they'll fumble around and mess with those and open those up.
[02:56:06.694 --> 02:56:08.256]  I mean, they dig through everything.
[02:56:08.256 --> 02:56:11.020]  It's totally ridiculous.
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:12.282]  It's a total setup.
[02:56:13.766 --> 02:56:17.787]  I mean, a lot of these rifles he had, you can't even break down and put in small bags.
[02:56:17.787 --> 02:56:19.307]  It's pure bull.
[02:56:19.307 --> 02:56:28.629]  He was in there for five days with 22 guns, with two rooms, transferring the food to another room so they wouldn't get suspicious.
[02:56:28.629 --> 02:56:31.670]  You don't think they don't pay attention that you're eating in one room and going to another?
[02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:33.610]  Oh my gosh.
[02:56:33.610 --> 02:56:36.691]  Nobody spies on you like hotels, folks.
[02:56:36.691 --> 02:56:38.951]  And they do it so people can't get in and run scams.
[02:56:38.951 --> 02:56:40.052]  I mean, I think it's a police state.
[02:56:40.052 --> 02:56:40.592]  I don't like it.
[02:56:40.592 --> 02:56:42.152]  But, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:56:43.402 --> 02:56:46.684]  Vegas searches your room.
[02:56:46.684 --> 02:56:48.966]  They profile you when they leave.
[02:56:48.966 --> 02:56:53.369]  They're hooked into Homeland Security, data threat analysis.
[02:56:53.369 --> 02:56:56.732]  Hotels, major hotel chains are threat fusion centers.
[02:56:56.732 --> 02:56:57.392]  Okay?
[02:56:57.392 --> 02:56:58.953]  That's a big secret.
[02:56:58.953 --> 02:57:10.902]  It's not a public knowledge and it's not classified, but hotels are considered major nodes as are car rental facilities and things like that in the threat fusion center system.
[02:57:11.542 --> 02:57:13.143]  And so they are threat fusion centers.
[02:57:13.143 --> 02:57:16.085]  This guy attacked a crowd from a threat fusion center.
[02:57:16.085 --> 02:57:18.827]  What do you say to that?
[02:57:18.827 --> 02:57:24.790]  Oh man, like, it's the most ridiculous thing how tactically set up this was.
[02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:32.375]  Like, that 400 yards he's got, that 32nd story height of the kill zone that was set up.
[02:57:32.375 --> 02:57:33.676]  You don't just come up with that.
[02:57:34.498 --> 02:57:36.979]  Exactly, and he had cameras out in the hallway.
[02:57:36.979 --> 02:57:40.780]  I mean, and then the people that knew this guy said he was a mentally ill basket case.
[02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:41.821]  He was a cutout.
[02:57:41.821 --> 02:57:42.741]  He was a patsy.
[02:57:42.741 --> 02:57:44.402]  He was a Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:57:44.402 --> 02:57:49.123]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:57:49.123 --> 02:57:59.087]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many
[02:58:01.113 --> 02:58:01.953]  We're good to go.
[02:58:28.660 --> 02:58:29.040]  We're good.

[03:00:01.832 --> 03:00:06.533]  It's a revolutionary act to spread the link NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com

[03:00:39.329 --> 03:00:43.172]  Student Reports, noose hung outside room.
[03:00:43.172 --> 03:00:47.756]  Turns out it's to be a lost shoelace.
[03:00:47.756 --> 03:00:50.598]  Meanwhile, the political correctness hysteria is intensifying.
[03:00:50.598 --> 03:00:52.159]  That's on newswars.com.
[03:00:52.159 --> 03:00:55.742]  Research, Islam now world's most common official state religion.
[03:00:55.742 --> 03:00:58.204]  Yeah, because they make it the state-run religion.
[03:00:58.204 --> 03:00:59.605]  They don't tolerate anybody.
[03:00:59.605 --> 03:01:01.307]  But we're just supposed to let that on in, you know.
[03:01:02.936 --> 03:01:04.117]  I'm not joining a cult, man.
[03:01:04.117 --> 03:01:05.658]  You're not going to put me under it.
[03:01:05.658 --> 03:01:07.019]  Not going to happen.
[03:01:07.019 --> 03:01:09.621]  Lexi, calling from Austin, Texas.
[03:01:09.621 --> 03:01:11.042]  Thanks for holding, Lexi.
[03:01:11.042 --> 03:01:12.523]  I'm going to go to Ian, Josh, and others.
[03:01:12.523 --> 03:01:13.984]  Lexi.
[03:01:13.984 --> 03:01:15.185]  No problem.
[03:01:15.185 --> 03:01:16.546]  Hi, how are you?
[03:01:16.546 --> 03:01:18.307]  I'm good.
[03:01:18.307 --> 03:01:19.008]  Good.
[03:01:19.008 --> 03:01:23.871]  Okay, so I have kind of a theory or I guess a question of
[03:01:25.470 --> 03:01:27.832]  Is this legit thinking?
[03:01:27.832 --> 03:01:33.636]  But everyone's looking into Mary Lou and her past, this and that, and... What about the brother?
[03:01:33.636 --> 03:01:34.957]  What about all the other brothers?
[03:01:34.957 --> 03:01:36.198]  What about the brother?
[03:01:36.198 --> 03:01:42.523]  Yes, and I'm like, dude, they so could have done this together, and... Oh, that brother is so suspicious.
[03:01:42.523 --> 03:01:45.625]  I've never seen someone so disingenuous.
[03:01:45.625 --> 03:01:48.227]  He just screams the weasel.
[03:01:50.097 --> 03:02:02.563]  Absolutely, and he would be the crazier one to go through it, maybe even talk Steven into it, and then before he leaves, he cuts those cameras, pops one in his brother, and leaves.
[03:02:02.563 --> 03:02:11.347]  And now he's on... Well, I don't want to say that with any evidence, but obviously he's got four other brothers, family, they're all intertwined.
[03:02:11.347 --> 03:02:16.950]  If all this stuff we're hearing about the gun room, secret, and all this other stuff in the airplanes, and now he gave them all money,
[03:02:17.350 --> 03:02:20.111]  Clearly, they're all accomplice suspects.
[03:02:20.111 --> 03:02:26.273]  I'm not saying they're accomplices, but yeah, the FBI, the police, everybody should be basically in their business.
[03:02:26.273 --> 03:02:28.194]  They should already all been raided.
[03:02:28.194 --> 03:02:30.935]  They should all be searched.
[03:02:30.935 --> 03:02:32.116]  I agree.
[03:02:32.116 --> 03:02:35.737]  Focusing on the woman, I think is a diversion.
[03:02:35.737 --> 03:02:46.541]  Yeah, and the brother, Eric, I think is his name, he would have time to get on a plane because it's right there by the airport.
[03:02:47.330 --> 03:02:49.332]  Get back to Orlando before the morning.
[03:02:49.332 --> 03:02:50.953]  Where are his records of his activities?
[03:02:50.953 --> 03:02:52.434]  Well, listen, there's other brothers.
[03:02:52.434 --> 03:02:53.875]  There's other brothers.
[03:02:53.875 --> 03:02:54.415]  Here's the deal.
[03:02:54.415 --> 03:02:56.036]  We don't know that.
[03:02:56.036 --> 03:02:56.417]  Okay?
[03:02:56.417 --> 03:02:58.558]  I'm just saying the guy's squirrely.
[03:02:58.558 --> 03:03:02.541]  Maybe he just is super quirky.
[03:03:02.541 --> 03:03:03.962]  But I hear you, Lexi.
[03:03:03.962 --> 03:03:10.047]  Anything else?
[03:03:10.047 --> 03:03:11.448]  Lexi, any other points?
[03:03:12.951 --> 03:03:15.553]  Oh, I didn't know if you were still there.
[03:03:15.553 --> 03:03:16.594]  No, that's really it.
[03:03:16.594 --> 03:03:23.338]  I just think, you know, his brother, there's more going on with him than we're getting knowledge of.
[03:03:23.338 --> 03:03:25.179]  That is certainly a fact.
[03:03:25.179 --> 03:03:25.840]  Lexi, thank you.
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:27.501]  You're 100% right.
[03:03:27.501 --> 03:03:30.423]  I mean, the police say, guaranteed he had help.
[03:03:30.423 --> 03:03:35.846]  What's the exact quote here?
[03:03:35.846 --> 03:03:36.947]  Did not act alone.
[03:03:38.695 --> 03:03:43.959]  Because there's no way that he acted alone and that they're looking into radicalization.
[03:03:43.959 --> 03:03:45.500]  Bingo!
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:49.782]  Let's go to Ian in Arizona.
[03:03:49.782 --> 03:03:50.543]  You're on the air, Ian.
[03:03:50.543 --> 03:03:53.225]  Hello, Alex.
[03:03:53.225 --> 03:03:54.205]  Good to talk to you, man.
[03:03:54.205 --> 03:03:55.706]  I'm a longtime listener.
[03:03:55.706 --> 03:03:56.467]  First time caller.
[03:03:57.573 --> 03:04:00.096]  I just wanted to go through a couple quick points with you.
[03:04:00.096 --> 03:04:00.636]  You know what?
[03:04:00.636 --> 03:04:01.517]  I didn't look at the clock.
[03:04:01.517 --> 03:04:02.158]  I apologize.
[03:04:02.158 --> 03:04:03.719]  You gotta hold one more minute.
[03:04:03.719 --> 03:04:04.179]  Stay there, Ian.
[03:04:04.179 --> 03:04:06.602]  I'm gonna come right back to you, finish up with Ian and Josh.
[03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:07.242]  I apologize, Ian.
[03:04:07.242 --> 03:04:08.443]  I didn't look at the clock, right?
[03:04:08.443 --> 03:04:09.084]  We got a new clock.
[03:04:09.084 --> 03:04:10.785]  Things are a little bit different.
[03:04:10.785 --> 03:04:11.506]  I'm getting used to it.
[03:04:11.506 --> 03:04:14.389]  We're taking phone calls on our board here in Austin, Texas.
[03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:23.197]  When we come back, I'll go right to Ian for a couple minutes, and then Josh, then hand the baton to the one, the only, NoMoreFakeNews.com proprietor, John Rappaport.
[03:04:24.301 --> 03:04:26.842]  And remember, John Rappaport had that site 15 years ago.
[03:04:26.842 --> 03:04:28.962]  So we got the whole fake news wars going on right now?
[03:04:28.962 --> 03:04:31.382]  Well, he originally said no more fake news.
[03:04:31.382 --> 03:04:35.683]  And so the father of exposing fake news will be taking over.
[03:04:35.683 --> 03:04:36.924]  By the way, he's been emailing me.
[03:04:36.924 --> 03:04:37.544]  We've been talking.
[03:04:37.544 --> 03:04:38.764]  I've been too busy to get back with him.
[03:04:38.764 --> 03:04:39.424]  I need to.
[03:04:39.424 --> 03:04:44.305]  He's also started reporting for us in the field on the East Coast in the South.
[03:04:44.305 --> 03:04:45.165]  So that's going to be happening.
[03:04:45.165 --> 03:04:46.365]  So a yes to your plan, John.
[03:04:46.365 --> 03:04:47.466]  We need to get that going.
[03:04:47.466 --> 03:04:48.906]  So, so much more straight ahead.
[03:04:54.122 --> 03:04:58.988]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul.
[03:04:58.988 --> 03:05:07.720]  The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:11.925]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[03:05:12.125 --> 03:05:18.368]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[03:05:18.368 --> 03:05:22.930]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[03:05:22.930 --> 03:05:26.952]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[03:05:26.952 --> 03:05:34.035]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints.
[03:05:34.255 --> 03:05:40.363]  Random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[03:05:40.363 --> 03:05:43.487]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[03:05:43.487 --> 03:05:48.113]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[03:05:48.113 --> 03:05:52.138]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[03:06:00.763 --> 03:06:07.529]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[03:06:07.529 --> 03:06:12.873]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[03:06:12.873 --> 03:06:14.535]  Curfew is now in place.
[03:06:14.535 --> 03:06:15.676]  Return to your homes.
[03:06:23.072 --> 03:06:27.814]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:27.814 --> 03:06:31.795]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:31.795 --> 03:06:44.680]  You know, it's really sad that so much of the information we popularize, globalism, deep state, martial law, new world order, vaccine death, black ops squads, false flag, is now just common vernacular.
[03:06:46.226 --> 03:06:53.349]  But I did all this knowing that historically, if somebody got to jump on the globalists, they'd fail.
[03:06:53.349 --> 03:07:04.213]  And then if people said, wait, you have an unelected planetary world government, run by people that are anti-prosperity, who use medical tyranny to control us, why would we go along with this?
[03:07:04.213 --> 03:07:12.697]  Once you expose that globalism's real, and the IMF and World Bank are real, and the TPP's real, and Congress can't see the secret agreements, people are going to say, no way!
[03:07:14.363 --> 03:07:16.525]  People said, oh look, they're beating everybody up in Catalonia, Alex.
[03:07:16.525 --> 03:07:17.605]  You said they were going to break away.
[03:07:17.605 --> 03:07:20.187]  Look, now they're even breaking away more.
[03:07:20.187 --> 03:07:21.769]  It was like 80% wanted to break away.
[03:07:21.769 --> 03:07:23.330]  Now it's 95%.
[03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:25.031]  And the taxes aren't getting paid.
[03:07:25.031 --> 03:07:27.053]  And the cops are all getting thrown out of the hotels.
[03:07:27.053 --> 03:07:29.614]  And Catalonia is going to break even harder with Spain now.
[03:07:29.614 --> 03:07:30.435]  Just like Brexit.
[03:07:30.435 --> 03:07:31.216]  They pass it.
[03:07:31.216 --> 03:07:32.337]  Now they're trying to fight it.
[03:07:32.337 --> 03:07:35.059]  It'll be even stronger now.
[03:07:35.059 --> 03:07:37.540]  My parents were just in England and Scotland for two and a half weeks.
[03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:39.302]  They were mobbed by listeners.
[03:07:41.684 --> 03:07:44.485]  People in France, last time they were there, would say, Jones?
[03:07:44.485 --> 03:07:44.965]  Jones?
[03:07:44.965 --> 03:07:47.507]  You know Jones, like Alex Jones?
[03:07:47.507 --> 03:07:48.507]  They all were his parents.
[03:07:48.507 --> 03:07:51.708]  Oh, that's it, I'm driving you around for three days for free while you're here.
[03:07:51.708 --> 03:07:52.729]  Wouldn't take money.
[03:07:52.729 --> 03:07:54.430]  Same thing happened to him in Greece.
[03:07:54.430 --> 03:07:56.350]  Same thing happened to him in England.
[03:07:56.350 --> 03:08:01.753]  And I'm not bragging about me, folks, but Nigel Farage said last time he was on that half the people
[03:08:02.844 --> 03:08:05.506]  That joined UKIP in the last decade were from my show.
[03:08:05.506 --> 03:08:11.590]  And that's just because we were the only thing that was actually covering UK news and telling them about the EU and broadcasting.
[03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:13.191]  Anybody could have done it.
[03:08:13.191 --> 03:08:18.594]  I was just one of the first to do it in electronic mass media effectively.
[03:08:18.594 --> 03:08:25.138]  I drool over all these new good-looking studios and really smart talk show hosts that get it.
[03:08:25.138 --> 03:08:26.779]  I want to be obsolete.
[03:08:26.779 --> 03:08:30.081]  Believe me, I don't want to be the one that gets the hostage rescue team called.
[03:08:30.081 --> 03:08:32.063]  That they were inside the room with the Islamic stuff.
[03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:34.701]  And all the rest of it.
[03:08:34.701 --> 03:08:35.942]  And have it all come out and be true.
[03:08:35.942 --> 03:08:38.543]  You think it's fun to be that right?
[03:08:38.543 --> 03:08:42.405]  You think it's fun to have them... And I'm not complaining.
[03:08:42.405 --> 03:08:44.647]  I'm just letting you know.
[03:08:44.647 --> 03:08:45.727]  This is real.
[03:08:45.727 --> 03:08:48.729]  And we're winning!
[03:08:48.729 --> 03:08:49.449]  We're winning!
[03:08:49.449 --> 03:08:54.832]  People like John Rappaport, 25 years ago, he was already out there fighting the globalists before I even got on air.
[03:08:54.832 --> 03:09:02.137]  And I didn't even know he'd been on air five years by the time I discovered him, like in 1996, doing TV interviews with people like David Icke, you name it.
[03:09:02.796 --> 03:09:04.858]  He worked for major networks, newspapers.
[03:09:04.858 --> 03:09:06.519]  He was aware from the inside.
[03:09:06.519 --> 03:09:09.261]  He went and exposed it.
[03:09:09.261 --> 03:09:10.882]  And so that's what's so exciting.
[03:09:10.882 --> 03:09:14.985]  This is our time now to come together and realize the truth.
[03:09:14.985 --> 03:09:21.130]  And all the panicking and all the pushing and all the freaking out is being done by the globalists because they're weak.
[03:09:21.130 --> 03:09:22.932]  John's taking over here in just one moment.
[03:09:22.932 --> 03:09:26.634]  I promised to finish up with Ian, but we had a caller, a lady that just called.
[03:09:27.714 --> 03:09:28.194]  I don't
[03:09:48.356 --> 03:09:50.757]  Pennywise or something.
[03:09:50.757 --> 03:10:00.923]  You'll float, come down here, there's clowns and balloons and there's horses and lions and tigers and bears, oh my, and there's elephants too, you're gonna like it, just get closer.
[03:10:00.923 --> 03:10:07.366]  And I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but everybody looks at him, changing his stories, flip-flopping, here it is.
[03:10:07.366 --> 03:10:11.168]  They're wanting to take him into custody right now, this is just breaking.
[03:10:11.168 --> 03:10:15.090]  Vegas shooter Steven Paddock's younger brother is wanted by cops.
[03:10:15.090 --> 03:10:17.472]  Oh, he's got warrants out for all this other stuff.
[03:10:18.786 --> 03:10:23.910]  Little petty stuff like speeding tickets and all this, but now they suddenly want him.
[03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:26.032]  Uh, think so?
[03:10:26.032 --> 03:10:29.374]  He's incarnate weasel.
[03:10:29.374 --> 03:10:36.780]  He's half weasel, half fox, half fruit bat.
[03:10:36.780 --> 03:10:38.321]  Yes, I know, you can't be three halves.
[03:10:38.321 --> 03:10:39.862]  That's a joke, folks.
[03:10:39.862 --> 03:10:45.407]  They actually have pieces where they think when I make the man-bear-pig joke, they go, Jones really believes that things can have three halves.
[03:10:46.363 --> 03:10:52.328]  No, it's called satire, but they've actually had pieces on that on the Young Turks saying, I don't know that.
[03:10:52.328 --> 03:10:55.930]  See, preying on their audience so they can feel official and powerful.
[03:10:55.930 --> 03:10:57.231]  But let's go to Ian in Arizona.
[03:10:57.231 --> 03:10:57.992]  Thanks for holding.
[03:10:57.992 --> 03:11:00.714]  Go ahead and make your point, sir.
[03:11:00.714 --> 03:11:01.174]  Yes, sir.
[03:11:01.174 --> 03:11:04.397]  I just want to say again, thanks Alex for everything you do, longtime listener.
[03:11:04.918 --> 03:11:12.861]  I am an African American Trump supporter and I appreciate that we have a channel to watch, man, because with all the fake news going on, you know, it's hard to get through the lies.
[03:11:12.861 --> 03:11:16.663]  But anyway, the points I wanted to get past was first quick point, Jimmy Kimmel.
[03:11:16.663 --> 03:11:26.067]  I think it's pretty ironic with all the propaganda he's pushing that his actual, and I think a lot of people know this, his actual recording studio is an old Masonic building.
[03:11:26.067 --> 03:11:30.109]  And I'm not trying to demonize all Masons, but we do know that there are secret societies.
[03:11:30.109 --> 03:11:32.690]  So I just think it's kind of funny that, you know, he records all these
[03:11:33.314 --> 03:11:33.855]  I don't think so.
[03:11:51.414 --> 03:11:52.194]  Yes sir, yes sir I do.
[03:11:52.194 --> 03:11:54.195]  Other thing I wanted to say was, uh, two more points.
[03:11:54.195 --> 03:11:56.616]  Other thing, the other caller said something about Steve Pchenik.
[03:12:14.582 --> 03:12:23.651]  I like him, he says some good stuff tactically sometimes, but I was wondering the same thing, if maybe he was still kind of connected a little more to the CIA than we might like.
[03:12:23.651 --> 03:12:31.358]  I mean, I know that you have connections with the CIA, like, not like that, but people that you talk to that you can get information from, you've got connections from everywhere, that's what you do.
[03:12:31.358 --> 03:12:32.600]  You're a journalist, you're a...
[03:12:34.581 --> 03:12:35.882]  Let's be clear.
[03:12:35.882 --> 03:12:39.065]  The CIA is a giant, sprawling, secret government.
[03:12:39.065 --> 03:12:39.946]  It's the biggest part of it.
[03:12:39.946 --> 03:12:41.467]  It's been around since 1947.
[03:12:41.467 --> 03:12:42.768]  Parts of it before that.
[03:12:42.768 --> 03:12:44.510]  It's a whole bunch of different factions.
[03:12:44.510 --> 03:12:46.732]  Some would say seven different factions, whatever.
[03:12:46.732 --> 03:12:47.352]  So, of course,
[03:12:48.473 --> 03:12:50.335]  Not, never get out of it at that level.
[03:12:50.335 --> 03:12:52.256]  He used to run major operations.
[03:12:52.256 --> 03:12:54.198]  And I never know what weirdness he's involved in.
[03:12:54.198 --> 03:12:55.059]  He's a really smart guy.
[03:12:55.059 --> 03:12:56.781]  He's done a lot of good stuff.
[03:12:56.781 --> 03:12:58.922]  But also, I've seen the videos.
[03:12:58.922 --> 03:13:01.645]  It's ridiculous to say those people weren't actually shot.
[03:13:01.645 --> 03:13:02.946]  And you got to ask what's going on.
[03:13:02.946 --> 03:13:09.352]  And I have seen him flip-flop and, you know, do some things lately about the generals taking over and how it's bad and how they've gone too far.
[03:13:09.352 --> 03:13:12.535]  And then a week later, he admonishes me and saying there's no problem.
[03:13:12.535 --> 03:13:13.455]  And I think a lot of it is.
[03:13:14.417 --> 03:13:18.240]  People, you know, have folks grab him by his short hairs and let him know who's boss.
[03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:19.641]  Me, I'm a kamikaze.
[03:13:19.641 --> 03:13:21.982]  I don't care what the threats come through, what goes on.
[03:13:21.982 --> 03:13:22.803]  People never even hear about it.
[03:13:22.803 --> 03:13:24.284]  I just say, do whatever you're going to do.
[03:13:24.284 --> 03:13:24.984]  I'm not stopping.
[03:13:24.984 --> 03:13:28.227]  So, you know, we'll just see who's the bigger man at the end of the day.
[03:13:28.227 --> 03:13:30.168]  And I'm not saying he's sold out or anything.
[03:13:30.168 --> 03:13:32.730]  I just know he's smart and knows that that's not accurate.
[03:13:32.730 --> 03:13:34.191]  But I don't want to get off into him.
[03:13:34.191 --> 03:13:38.073]  Maybe I'll have him on in a few days about, you know, he'll just blow up and, you know, have some thing.
[03:13:38.073 --> 03:13:40.975]  I mean, look, he's entitled to his opinion.
[03:13:40.975 --> 03:13:42.216]  I have mine.
[03:13:42.216 --> 03:13:42.717]  Anything else, Ian?
[03:13:44.665 --> 03:14:10.316]  Oh yeah, the last thing I wanted to say was that I also believe that we really need to, and I say this because of how far we're going, and I mean, I still love that you do news every day, I watch you every day, I started off watching your documentaries, but I really do think we need to look back at some of the things that people have put out, like the Checks, Mars, and even the William Coopers, I know you guys had your beat back in the days, but I feel like we have to look back to the times of what happened.
[03:14:10.316 --> 03:14:11.136]  I totally agree.
[03:14:11.136 --> 03:14:12.717]  In fact, I already told Rob Doom.
[03:14:13.700 --> 03:14:15.701]  No, he told me and I was already thinking it the same day.
[03:14:15.701 --> 03:14:23.666]  We need to get back to all the basics, cover each area, vaccines, electromagnetic radiation, the occult, the different power structures.
[03:14:23.666 --> 03:14:24.407]  I totally agree.
[03:14:24.407 --> 03:14:25.267]  Thank you so much.
[03:14:25.267 --> 03:14:26.728]  We're going to go to break.
[03:14:26.728 --> 03:14:31.391]  I'm going to come back and hand the baton to NoMoreFakeNews.com proprietor.
[03:14:31.391 --> 03:14:34.774]  And we are going to let him get to all the news he's got to cover.
[03:14:34.774 --> 03:14:37.315]  But just listen briefly.
[03:14:37.315 --> 03:14:39.256]  Take what you're bringing up there just about
[03:14:41.834 --> 03:14:43.075]  It's more like William Cooper.
[03:14:43.075 --> 03:14:46.018]  I had no beef with William Cooper.
[03:14:46.018 --> 03:14:48.721]  I understood how talk radio worked.
[03:14:48.721 --> 03:14:49.962]  He was a shortwave guy.
[03:14:49.962 --> 03:14:52.966]  I was also on shortwave, but also AM and FM stations.
[03:14:52.966 --> 03:14:58.732]  And so he started fights with me and criticized me and talked bad about me, I guess because he thought I was competition.
[03:15:00.245 --> 03:15:08.177]  And I thought it was funny, because I knew that other talk show hosts would start fights with the other one, but if you didn't respond, you would just get their audience.
[03:15:08.177 --> 03:15:12.183]  So, see, Cooper didn't have other talk show hosts on.
[03:15:12.183 --> 03:15:13.826]  You know, rest in peace, did a lot of good work.
[03:15:13.826 --> 03:15:14.727]  Great talk show host.
[03:15:15.623 --> 03:15:16.564]  I had everybody on.
[03:15:16.564 --> 03:15:22.387]  I had Gavin McGinnis on, and they had the direct CRTV, and that would see itself as a competitor.
[03:15:22.387 --> 03:15:23.988]  You don't see those shows having me on.
[03:15:23.988 --> 03:15:28.451]  You don't see all the other outfits having me on, because they're Breitbart.
[03:15:28.451 --> 03:15:31.653]  Because they're all about, they're in charge, they control the conservative movement.
[03:15:31.653 --> 03:15:32.594]  I'm just about winning.
[03:15:33.214 --> 03:15:34.195]  And defeating the globalists.
[03:15:34.195 --> 03:15:36.117]  So, I'm not in all that.
[03:15:36.117 --> 03:15:37.658]  I'm not involved in that.
[03:15:37.658 --> 03:15:40.280]  The only other guy that's like that is Matt Drudge.
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:42.342]  He's promoting everybody to win the fight.
[03:15:42.342 --> 03:15:44.124]  Because we're in a serious battle.
[03:15:44.124 --> 03:15:46.166]  Alright, John Rappaport straight ahead.

[03:18:22.945 --> 03:18:29.627]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,

[03:20:05.603 --> 03:20:07.364]  Strange days are here, my friend.
[03:20:07.364 --> 03:20:08.664]  Strange days have found us.
[03:20:08.664 --> 03:20:13.786]  It's John Rappaport with NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[03:20:13.786 --> 03:20:25.529]  We got another caller here that I'm sure Rappaport will want to take in the next segment.
[03:20:25.529 --> 03:20:28.310]  Josh says CNN interview looks like green screen.
[03:20:28.310 --> 03:20:31.651]  CNN's been caught faking locations since the Gulf War and admits it.
[03:20:32.813 --> 03:20:40.158]  I mean, Brian Williams is on NBC still, telling us to turn our guns in, when he's fabricated more than 30 stories completely.
[03:20:40.158 --> 03:20:45.761]  He said he got shot down by an RPG with a helicopter.
[03:20:45.761 --> 03:20:47.262]  In a helicopter.
[03:20:47.262 --> 03:20:52.185]  I'm turning this over to John Rappaport, and I appreciate him letting me come into part of his hour.
[03:20:52.185 --> 03:20:56.768]  I'm pretty wound up here, and I want to invite him back on anytime he wants, by the way, with David Night, Oro, and Schroyer.
[03:20:56.768 --> 03:21:00.491]  It's coming up in about 40 minutes, but just briefly, when I sit here and carp,
[03:21:02.252 --> 03:21:03.834]  And harp.
[03:21:03.834 --> 03:21:05.015]  And just say, we're under attack!
[03:21:05.015 --> 03:21:05.695]  We're the tip of the spear!
[03:21:05.695 --> 03:21:06.296]  We're really big!
[03:21:06.296 --> 03:21:07.016]  We're affecting the world!
[03:21:07.016 --> 03:21:07.837]  We're changing everything!
[03:21:07.837 --> 03:21:10.599]  I mean, it's really happening.
[03:21:10.599 --> 03:21:14.603]  And so just know we need your hopes, your prayers, your support, your financial support.
[03:21:14.603 --> 03:21:16.084]  Plus we got products you really need.
[03:21:16.084 --> 03:21:18.005]  And this is just the plug for the hour.
[03:21:18.005 --> 03:21:20.027]  Brain Force had sold out.
[03:21:20.027 --> 03:21:21.168]  It was sold out for months.
[03:21:21.168 --> 03:21:22.009]  I doubled the order.
[03:21:23.268 --> 03:21:29.677]  But I want people that are on the fence and haven't tried this Nootropic yet to find out why it's an amazing product.
[03:21:29.677 --> 03:21:35.284]  The very best science technology out there at the lowest price, thousands of reviews, 4.8 stars, unprecedented.
[03:21:38.468 --> 03:21:39.548]  5,000 plus reviews.
[03:21:39.548 --> 03:21:40.129]  Blow that up.
[03:21:40.129 --> 03:21:41.389]  My eyes may be failing.
[03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:42.809]  They're not 20-20 like they used to be.
[03:21:42.809 --> 03:21:43.850]  Blow it up a little bit more.
[03:21:43.850 --> 03:21:47.391]  You know, the star reviews right there.
[03:21:47.391 --> 03:21:47.591]  Yeah.
[03:21:47.591 --> 03:21:49.011]  5,139 to 4.6 reviews.
[03:21:49.011 --> 03:21:50.831]  So, that's third-party sites.
[03:21:50.831 --> 03:21:52.232]  It's 50% off.
[03:21:52.232 --> 03:21:54.452]  We didn't raise the price and lower it.
[03:21:54.452 --> 03:21:56.073]  It's 50% off the regular price.
[03:21:56.693 --> 03:21:57.793]  Thank you, Alex, as always.
[03:22:27.572 --> 03:22:28.873]  Wow.
[03:22:28.873 --> 03:22:30.094]  What a week.
[03:22:30.094 --> 03:22:30.815]  What a week.
[03:22:30.815 --> 03:22:33.377]  Where do we start?
[03:22:33.377 --> 03:22:35.118]  Vegas.
[03:22:35.118 --> 03:22:37.720]  Steven Paddock.
[03:22:37.720 --> 03:22:39.202]  The Patsy.
[03:22:39.202 --> 03:22:39.702]  Is that right?
[03:22:39.702 --> 03:22:42.524]  You see Patsy?
[03:22:42.524 --> 03:22:44.706]  23 weapons, they say.
[03:22:44.706 --> 03:22:49.570]  Found in his hotel suite at the Mandalay.
[03:22:49.570 --> 03:22:51.892]  23 weapons, okay?
[03:22:51.892 --> 03:22:54.154]  Now, this is not just some guy.
[03:22:54.978 --> 03:22:58.359]  Who happened to wander into a casino once in a while.
[03:22:58.359 --> 03:23:00.279]  He was very well known.
[03:23:00.279 --> 03:23:02.380]  High stakes gambler.
[03:23:02.380 --> 03:23:04.280]  You bet.
[03:23:04.280 --> 03:23:05.780]  Hotels know people like that.
[03:23:05.780 --> 03:23:06.940]  They understand.
[03:23:06.940 --> 03:23:22.724]  So, you're telling me that he's lugging suitcase after suitcase of steel, heavy weight, up to his suite, and nobody is taking notice.
[03:23:22.724 --> 03:23:24.544]  They're saying, well, maybe it's all cash.
[03:23:25.123 --> 03:23:30.986]  You know, maybe he's bringing in $50 million and he needs a lot of suitcases.
[03:23:30.986 --> 03:23:34.008]  So let's make sure we comp him.
[03:23:34.008 --> 03:23:50.897]  This, from a city where in any big casino, a pit boss down on the floor or an eye in the sky can look down at a blackjack table and spot a card counter.
[03:23:50.897 --> 03:23:52.718]  That's not somebody doing sleight of hand.
[03:23:53.516 --> 03:24:06.958]  That's somebody doing mental tricks in his skull, using formula, algorithms, based on the cards that have been played, to know which bets to place.
[03:24:06.958 --> 03:24:11.139]  And they can slot a card counter, and they can throw them out of the casino.
[03:24:11.139 --> 03:24:20.801]  But, you see, in the case of Stephen Paddock, they just couldn't notice this guy coming in and out with suitcases that were quite heavy.
[03:24:22.685 --> 03:24:24.225]  Just couldn't do it.
[03:24:24.225 --> 03:24:25.726]  Nobody could figure that out.
[03:24:25.726 --> 03:24:27.966]  Nobody noticed it.
[03:24:27.966 --> 03:24:34.228]  And on top of that, of course, he would never need all these weapons.
[03:24:34.228 --> 03:24:36.988]  For anything.
[03:24:36.988 --> 03:24:39.209]  He just brought them up there.
[03:24:39.209 --> 03:24:42.270]  For show, or for what reason, we don't know.
[03:24:42.270 --> 03:24:47.071]  Including, what was it, 12 rifles?
[03:24:47.071 --> 03:24:48.171]  Most of them modified.
[03:24:48.171 --> 03:24:51.932]  I mean, come on.
[03:24:51.932 --> 03:24:52.172]  Come on.
[03:24:53.294 --> 03:25:04.481]  And he's planning this operation for, we're told, for at least months, leading a secret life for years.
[03:25:04.481 --> 03:25:14.968]  So here's a guy who, it turns out, is not just, as his brother said, he's just a guy that likes burritos and he lives near Vegas.
[03:25:14.968 --> 03:25:22.013]  No, he's a real estate investor, millionaire, can do anything he wants in the world.
[03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:35.908]  But he decides that he's going to plan a long-term operation to kill unknown numbers of people, large numbers of people, that is going to result certainly in his own death.
[03:25:35.908 --> 03:25:38.709]  So this is a long-term plan by suicide.
[03:25:38.709 --> 03:25:45.133]  I'm just giving you the unbelievable things that we're supposed to be accepting here.
[03:25:45.714 --> 03:25:48.856]  The official story is unbelievable.
[03:25:48.856 --> 03:25:51.657]  And again, Vegas searches everybody's bags.
[03:25:51.657 --> 03:25:56.760]  Once you go in your room and you leave for the first time, it's a not publicized fact, but it's done.
[03:25:56.760 --> 03:25:58.681]  Most other hotels do it too.
[03:25:58.681 --> 03:25:59.521]  Five days.
[03:25:59.521 --> 03:26:02.683]  Why are they lying about him being there five days, not three?
[03:26:02.683 --> 03:26:03.703]  That's now confirmed.
[03:26:03.703 --> 03:26:05.204]  We broke that with the receipts.
[03:26:05.204 --> 03:26:10.867]  I mean, this whole thing, I know you always just lay out the facts here, John, but it's too riveting.
[03:26:10.867 --> 03:26:11.347]  You're right.
[03:26:11.347 --> 03:26:12.508]  The official's unbelievable.
[03:26:12.748 --> 03:26:12.888]  Yeah.
[03:26:12.888 --> 03:26:14.750]  I think that the room, the suite, and the hotel were staked.
[03:26:32.199 --> 03:26:35.964]  Staged as a prop for a photo op for okay.
[03:26:35.964 --> 03:26:36.805]  This is a guy.
[03:26:36.805 --> 03:26:42.171]  He was the only one he did it and whether or not he actually fired weapons himself.
[03:26:42.171 --> 03:26:48.639]  He was not the only shooter and what we're really talking about in the big picture as always in these events.
[03:26:49.665 --> 03:26:51.706]  We've got to take the guns away from everybody.
[03:26:51.706 --> 03:27:02.928]  Despite the fact that, you know, whether the weapon was legal or illegal, banned or whatever that the supposed shooter used, you've got to take the guns away from the people who don't commit crimes at all.
[03:27:02.928 --> 03:27:04.909]  And that's really going to solve the problem.
[03:27:04.909 --> 03:27:08.590]  While the criminals and terrorists, of course, get the guns anyway.
[03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:09.750]  We know that scenario.
[03:27:09.750 --> 03:27:15.691]  And then on top of this, the other big time agenda is surveillance state.
[03:27:15.691 --> 03:27:18.252]  Stepping that up, ramping that up, because now
[03:27:19.787 --> 03:27:23.272]  They can say, well, now we're sure that nobody is safe at any time.
[03:27:23.272 --> 03:27:25.255]  Sure, everybody's got to wear a body camera.
[03:27:25.255 --> 03:27:31.363]  That's the only thing that'll stop this, because we let him lug, you know, the armored fortress of weapons up there.
[03:27:31.363 --> 03:27:36.671]  So because we didn't do our jobs, now all of you have to lose even more of your rights here in the police state.
[03:27:37.415 --> 03:27:38.095]  Exactly.
[03:27:38.095 --> 03:27:39.776]  And this is not just going to be America.
[03:27:39.776 --> 03:27:40.596]  This is global.
[03:27:40.596 --> 03:27:42.416]  And so you point to this event.
[03:27:42.416 --> 03:27:43.657]  Well, what are you going to do?
[03:27:43.657 --> 03:27:47.598]  If you go to a public restroom and a gas station, there'll be a metal detector before you.
[03:27:47.598 --> 03:27:49.418]  I mean, you know, that's what they're aiming for.
[03:27:49.418 --> 03:27:49.699]  That's right.
[03:27:49.699 --> 03:27:54.180]  Trillions of dollars will be made by the whole securities infrastructure off of this.
[03:27:54.180 --> 03:27:55.320]  There's your motive right there.
[03:27:55.320 --> 03:27:56.120]  What about the target?
[03:27:56.120 --> 03:27:56.821]  Because I'm picking your brain.
[03:27:56.821 --> 03:27:58.001]  We're on a break here.
[03:27:58.001 --> 03:28:01.562]  What about the target, John Eppenport, this group of flyover country Trump supporters?
[03:28:02.170 --> 03:28:03.431]  No question about it.
[03:28:03.431 --> 03:28:11.694]  I mean, you know, you've always got to look at the target, even though, of course, the mainstream, blainstream people are avoiding that at all costs.
[03:28:11.694 --> 03:28:12.834]  Gee, motive!
[03:28:12.834 --> 03:28:13.494]  The target!
[03:28:13.494 --> 03:28:14.935]  Don't look at the target!
[03:28:14.935 --> 03:28:16.616]  Don't look at the target.
[03:28:16.616 --> 03:28:27.840]  Let's see, there's Trump supporters, conservatives, gun owners, Americana people who are just there for a good time to enjoy themselves peacefully.
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:29.100]  We don't want to think about that.
[03:28:29.100 --> 03:28:30.001]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:28:31.341 --> 03:28:34.804]  He's John Rappaport with nomorefakenews.com, hosting for InfoWars.
[03:28:34.804 --> 03:28:37.587]  And I love it when he hosts the show, so I'm gonna punch out of here.
[03:28:37.587 --> 03:28:40.550]  I'm leaving the room, so I don't jump in.
[03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:42.491]  It's almost like I have my own network or something.
[03:28:42.491 --> 03:28:43.793]  I'm crazy.
[03:28:43.793 --> 03:28:45.334]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:28:45.334 --> 03:28:47.876]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:28:47.876 --> 03:28:49.158]  Have you shared those links?
[03:28:49.158 --> 03:28:50.399]  Because the globalists hate it when you do.
[03:28:52.455 --> 03:28:52.935]  Not a group.
[03:28:52.935 --> 03:28:54.376]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:28:54.376 --> 03:28:55.716]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:28:55.716 --> 03:28:56.936]  Why is this so good?
[03:28:56.936 --> 03:29:02.218]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:29:02.218 --> 03:29:15.761]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:29:15.761 --> 03:29:17.122]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:29:17.902 --> 03:29:19.543]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:29:19.543 --> 03:29:22.123]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:29:22.123 --> 03:29:23.424]  These are all parasites.
[03:29:23.424 --> 03:29:24.524]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:29:24.524 --> 03:29:25.864]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:29:25.864 --> 03:29:30.366]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:29:30.366 --> 03:29:33.647]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:29:33.647 --> 03:29:36.708]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:29:36.708 --> 03:29:37.768]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:29:37.768 --> 03:29:39.669]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:29:39.669 --> 03:29:40.709]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:29:40.709 --> 03:29:43.430]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:29:43.430 --> 03:29:43.530]  And...
[03:29:44.290 --> 03:29:45.332]  You support the broadcast.
[03:29:45.332 --> 03:29:46.674]  Infowarslives.com.
[03:29:46.674 --> 03:29:48.917]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:29:48.917 --> 03:29:50.880]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:29:53.453 --> 03:30:02.935]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[03:30:02.935 --> 03:30:09.496]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[03:30:09.496 --> 03:30:17.018]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:30:17.418 --> 03:30:22.500]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:30:22.500 --> 03:30:28.602]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:30:28.602 --> 03:30:36.385]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:30:36.385 --> 03:30:43.268]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:30:43.268 --> 03:30:44.408]  10% off on auto ship.
[03:30:52.374 --> 03:30:57.878]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:30:57.878 --> 03:31:08.166]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[03:31:08.166 --> 03:31:17.569]  Infowars has had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:31:17.569 --> 03:31:31.572]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:31:31.572 --> 03:31:33.933]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[03:31:33.933 --> 03:31:37.594]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of the
[03:31:37.674 --> 03:31:38.354]  We're good.
[03:31:52.842 --> 03:31:54.724]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:54.724 --> 03:31:56.745]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:56.745 --> 03:31:59.668]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:59.668 --> 03:32:05.733]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:32:05.733 --> 03:32:14.921]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:32:14.921 --> 03:32:18.204]  Whether it's your home or office, yo, it's yourself, your co-workers,
[03:32:18.444 --> 03:32:22.450]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:32:22.450 --> 03:32:30.481]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:32:30.481 --> 03:32:31.563]  The general public doesn't.
[03:32:32.658 --> 03:32:36.601]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:32:36.601 --> 03:32:40.164]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:32:40.164 --> 03:32:46.869]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:32:46.869 --> 03:32:55.996]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:55.996 --> 03:32:58.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:52.184 --> 03:34:00.753]  You support the effort against insanity to restore sanity to the world.

[03:34:52.501 --> 03:34:56.982]  All right.
[03:34:56.982 --> 03:35:00.903]  Shots fired in the Bellagio Hotel.
[03:35:00.903 --> 03:35:02.723]  Not the Mandalay Bay.
[03:35:02.723 --> 03:35:03.924]  The Bellagio Hotel.
[03:35:03.924 --> 03:35:05.864]  Yesterday at No More Fake News.
[03:35:06.770 --> 03:35:08.632]  I put up a video.
[03:35:08.632 --> 03:35:20.343]  This was a personal video on a cell phone shot by a guest at the Bellagio on the night of the shooting at the concert.
[03:35:21.738 --> 03:35:32.607]  She is walking around in the lobby with her husband for six minutes plus talking and showing lots and lots of people standing in the lobby of the Bellagio Hotel.
[03:35:32.607 --> 03:35:45.818]  She is saying shots were fired through the glass of the front door of the Bellagio that the hotel is on lockdown and no one's allowed on the casino floor.
[03:35:46.738 --> 03:35:57.421]  And there are many, many people standing around in the wake of all of this in the lobby that she is filming, taping, recording on her cell phone.
[03:35:57.421 --> 03:36:00.441]  What are we to believe?
[03:36:00.441 --> 03:36:03.522]  Well, what do you say?
[03:36:03.522 --> 03:36:06.263]  Well, I can tell you this.
[03:36:06.263 --> 03:36:14.445]  Soon after I posted the video at No More Fake News, YouTube took it down.
[03:36:14.445 --> 03:36:15.525]  Took it down.
[03:36:16.204 --> 03:36:18.025]  On what basis?
[03:36:18.025 --> 03:36:20.366]  Well, let's see.
[03:36:20.366 --> 03:36:25.549]  It could be the truth, therefore it's disturbing, therefore we have to take it down.
[03:36:25.549 --> 03:36:29.952]  It was filmed inside a casino in Vegas, therefore we have to take it down.
[03:36:29.952 --> 03:36:35.154]  It was filmed by a woman and her husband.
[03:36:35.154 --> 03:36:36.775]  We don't like that anymore.
[03:36:36.775 --> 03:36:38.656]  What are we talking about here?
[03:36:38.656 --> 03:36:39.797]  We found another link.
[03:36:39.797 --> 03:36:42.959]  We reposted it.
[03:36:42.959 --> 03:36:45.380]  I had two separate other reports from people.
[03:36:46.213 --> 03:36:48.035]  Saying the same thing.
[03:36:48.035 --> 03:36:50.837]  Shots fired at the Bellagio Hotel.
[03:36:50.837 --> 03:36:52.018]  Why is this important?
[03:36:52.018 --> 03:36:53.439]  Well, obviously it's important.
[03:36:53.439 --> 03:36:59.163]  On the same night as the concert shooting below the Mandalay Bay.
[03:36:59.163 --> 03:37:03.326]  So now we really would be talking about multiple, multiple shooters.
[03:37:03.326 --> 03:37:06.509]  We would be talking about a lot of that.
[03:37:06.509 --> 03:37:06.869]  Not simply
[03:37:08.985 --> 03:37:18.951]  As pointed out, I think in the last hour, there's all manner of police audio from the night of the concert shooting talking about multiple shooters.
[03:37:18.951 --> 03:37:21.593]  Not just one cop, several cops.
[03:37:21.593 --> 03:37:23.194]  Back and forth, back and forth.
[03:37:23.194 --> 03:37:24.895]  Multiple shooters.
[03:37:24.895 --> 03:37:29.878]  Different floors of the Mandalay Bay.
[03:37:29.878 --> 03:37:30.559]  We have that.
[03:37:30.559 --> 03:37:34.061]  We have the now famous taxi cab video.
[03:37:35.146 --> 03:37:43.771]  Of the woman taxi cab driver parked outside the Mandalay Bay Hotel, waiting in line and noticing that nobody is there.
[03:37:43.771 --> 03:37:47.152]  What's happening inside the hotel?
[03:37:47.152 --> 03:37:48.653]  She hears shots fired.
[03:37:48.653 --> 03:37:50.154]  You can hear them.
[03:37:50.154 --> 03:37:52.755]  Yes, there are echo effects.
[03:37:52.755 --> 03:37:55.697]  And yes, there's a bounce back and forth.
[03:37:55.697 --> 03:37:59.279]  But you can also hear separate weapons being fired.
[03:37:59.279 --> 03:38:01.860]  It's obvious they're not the same weapon.
[03:38:02.603 --> 03:38:10.046]  That also suggests that in any kind of serious investigation, multiple shooters would be at the front of the list.
[03:38:11.969 --> 03:38:29.197]  These are important factors because they all point to not only mainstream media lying and lying and lying, and the authorities that are supposedly investigating this horrific crime lying and lying and lying, but it also points to agenda, agenda, agenda.
[03:38:29.197 --> 03:38:38.802]  And as I said in the last segment, of course, it's take the guns away, but it's also more and more and more surveillance state, bigger and higher and deeper.
[03:38:40.439 --> 03:38:44.370]  All the hotels are now going to have metal detectors.
[03:38:44.370 --> 03:38:47.077]  And then it's also the agenda of
[03:38:47.873 --> 03:38:50.794]  Well, gee, I don't think we should go to the football game this weekend, honey.
[03:38:50.794 --> 03:38:55.556]  You know it's outdoors, 60,000 people, and, you know, I'm not sure.
[03:38:55.556 --> 03:39:01.218]  Why don't we just get the so-and-so NFL package and stay at home and watch it on the big screen?
[03:39:01.218 --> 03:39:16.723]  And more and more people, I'm not just particularly talking about the NFL, because they have their own problems, but any public event of any size, if more and more people can be convinced to stay away,
[03:39:17.842 --> 03:39:24.309]  From malls, from sporting events, from theaters, etc., etc., etc.
[03:39:24.309 --> 03:39:27.112]  What happens to the economy?
[03:39:27.112 --> 03:39:29.535]  Agenda, agenda, agenda.
[03:39:29.535 --> 03:39:30.716]  More and more and more.
[03:39:31.963 --> 03:39:36.567]  So, what happened in Vegas feeds directly into this agenda.
[03:39:36.567 --> 03:39:50.638]  In fact, you can start looking up names like Sheldon Adelson and Michael Chertoff, and you can see where perhaps these gentlemen would profit significantly from enhanced security.
[03:39:50.638 --> 03:39:55.262]  Backscatter x-ray machines and who knows what other kinds of detectors.
[03:39:55.262 --> 03:39:58.205]  Check it out for yourself.
[03:39:58.205 --> 03:39:59.866]  Agenda, agenda, agenda.
[03:40:00.672 --> 03:40:01.513]  Globalism.
[03:40:01.513 --> 03:40:02.273]  Globalism.
[03:40:02.273 --> 03:40:02.833]  Globalism.
[03:40:02.833 --> 03:40:06.776]  Because what is the key to globalist society?
[03:40:06.776 --> 03:40:07.837]  In their plans.
[03:40:07.837 --> 03:40:10.098]  In their imagery.
[03:40:10.098 --> 03:40:12.360]  Suppression of the population.
[03:40:12.360 --> 03:40:13.741]  Keep them down.
[03:40:13.741 --> 03:40:15.542]  Keep them in fear.
[03:40:15.542 --> 03:40:17.323]  We will protect you.
[03:40:17.323 --> 03:40:19.484]  You must rely on us.
[03:40:19.484 --> 03:40:25.548]  We must put in a police state and a surveillance state and then everything is going to be okay.
[03:40:25.548 --> 03:40:29.131]  And just to make sure, we the globalists will
[03:40:30.146 --> 03:40:50.099]  Enact, fund, back, covertly stage all manner of horrific events to make sure that you are afraid, that you continue to be afraid, that you cower in the dark, and that you pay allegiance to us because ultimately we are the only protection that you have.
[03:40:50.099 --> 03:40:57.004]  So, this is a very significant event in Sin City, Vegas.
[03:40:58.195 --> 03:41:05.761]  And as more and more evidence gathers, that this is not the event that the media are painting.
[03:41:05.761 --> 03:41:09.243]  Not in any, any case.
[03:41:09.243 --> 03:41:21.772]  That it's looking more and more like the hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay, where Steven Paddock was staying, is a staged prop.
[03:41:21.772 --> 03:41:25.956]  That all the weapons there, he could never use.
[03:41:25.956 --> 03:41:26.556]  Never use.
[03:41:27.478 --> 03:41:32.903]  But they make a terrific presentation for the people who want to take guns away.
[03:41:32.903 --> 03:41:38.388]  You see, this is what you get when you allow people to have guns.
[03:41:38.388 --> 03:41:40.750]  This is what you get.
[03:41:40.750 --> 03:41:43.452]  This was not a guy with just one gun.
[03:41:43.452 --> 03:41:48.477]  This was a guy with a gigantic suite full of guns.
[03:41:48.477 --> 03:41:49.998]  Getting the message?
[03:41:49.998 --> 03:41:52.600]  Getting the message?
[03:41:52.600 --> 03:41:54.222]  And so, when I say
[03:41:55.231 --> 03:42:05.493]  How did this guy get all these suitcases with 23 weapons up to his hotel suite in a city where the surveillance never quits?
[03:42:05.493 --> 03:42:14.916]  That's a key question because we're talking about a staged event and a prop, a photo op.
[03:42:14.916 --> 03:42:16.276]  So there isn't any way
[03:42:16.852 --> 03:42:19.494]  That we could easily say, well, no problem.
[03:42:19.494 --> 03:42:21.856]  He just keeps taking stuff up and down.
[03:42:21.856 --> 03:42:23.257]  Sure, he does.
[03:42:23.257 --> 03:42:29.202]  A well-known high-stakes gambler in Vegas, right?
[03:42:29.202 --> 03:42:36.507]  Who shows up and plays some kind of supposedly fantastic video poker for $100,000.
[03:42:36.507 --> 03:42:44.714]  And he's just plugging weapons up to his room and there's no problem.
[03:42:46.810 --> 03:42:48.151]  It's John Rappaport.
[03:42:48.151 --> 03:42:52.354]  We will be back on Intro Wars after the break.
[03:42:52.354 --> 03:42:58.419]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[03:42:58.419 --> 03:43:07.686]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis's guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[03:43:07.686 --> 03:43:10.028]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[03:43:10.228 --> 03:43:11.429]  on the grasshoppers.
[03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:14.650]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money.
[03:43:14.650 --> 03:43:21.353]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[03:43:21.353 --> 03:43:25.835]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[03:43:25.835 --> 03:43:33.618]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[03:43:33.618 --> 03:43:39.681]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock,
[03:43:39.961 --> 03:43:42.062]  Or to protect you from home invasion.
[03:43:42.062 --> 03:43:48.044]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.

[03:43:50.445 --> 03:43:51.466]  I'm David Knight.

[03:45:10.457 --> 03:45:15.142]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:47:11.264 --> 03:47:23.134]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:23.134 --> 03:47:27.638]  John Rappaport here in the fourth hour, sitting in for Alex.
[03:47:27.638 --> 03:47:31.942]  We're talking about Vegas, baby.
[03:47:31.942 --> 03:47:33.944]  We're talking about the globalist agenda.
[03:47:33.944 --> 03:47:37.026]  We're talking about stage props.
[03:47:37.026 --> 03:47:38.828]  We're talking about Patsy.
[03:47:39.574 --> 03:47:42.495]  The Patsy, the setup.
[03:47:42.495 --> 03:47:46.918]  You know, there are people out there that just can't grasp it.
[03:47:46.918 --> 03:47:49.179]  They can't grasp the big globalist agenda.
[03:47:49.179 --> 03:47:56.743]  And they can't grasp the idea that these operations can be complicated.
[03:47:56.743 --> 03:48:07.368]  In other words, how you set up the Patsy, how you profile and choose the Patsy, how you recruit the Patsy, how you get somebody involved, and then
[03:48:08.700 --> 03:48:13.322]  The house comes crashing down on their heads, and you're free and clear.
[03:48:13.322 --> 03:48:14.162]  Gone.
[03:48:14.162 --> 03:48:16.523]  Gone with the wind.
[03:48:16.523 --> 03:48:19.424]  People don't think this actually happens.
[03:48:19.424 --> 03:48:21.605]  They don't think it's possible.
[03:48:21.605 --> 03:48:37.090]  But if they spent a few hours looking into the assassination of JFK, or his brother Bobby, or Martin Luther King, they would soon see that it's not only possible, but it happens all the time.
[03:48:38.681 --> 03:48:50.049]  In the case of the 1968 assassination of Bobby Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, Kennedy, who was running for president, was gaining in the cold.
[03:48:50.049 --> 03:48:58.254]  Bobby walks into the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel after his speech is over and he's shot and killed.
[03:48:58.254 --> 03:49:06.120]  And all of a sudden, this prime candidate for presidency, his murder is being investigated by who?
[03:49:06.866 --> 03:49:07.966]  The FBI?
[03:49:07.966 --> 03:49:09.567]  Absolutely not.
[03:49:09.567 --> 03:49:23.272]  A special unit is set up inside the notoriously corrupt LAPD called Special Unit Senator, S.U.S., to investigate the crime.
[03:49:23.272 --> 03:49:29.274]  And what do they discover and not say and bury and try to bury forever?
[03:49:30.296 --> 03:49:54.826]  That the shots that killed Bobby Kennedy came from behind him in the kitchen and the presumed assassin, who eventually confessed and is still in prison, Sirhan Sirhan, had a gun, was standing in front of Bobby Kennedy and therefore could never have fired the shots that killed him because those shots came from behind.
[03:49:54.826 --> 03:49:59.848]  And not only that, the number of shots fired in the kitchen at the Ambassador Hotel
[03:50:00.660 --> 03:50:10.486]  Were more than were contained in the clip of the gun that Sirhan Sirhan was holding in his hand.
[03:50:10.486 --> 03:50:13.208]  That's a slam dunk.
[03:50:13.208 --> 03:50:15.370]  That's a patsy.
[03:50:15.370 --> 03:50:18.231]  That's the way it's done.
[03:50:18.231 --> 03:50:27.337]  That explains a great deal of modern American history, as it turns out, if you look at these events.
[03:50:27.337 --> 03:50:30.019]  But it was all swept under the carpet and suppressed.
[03:50:31.778 --> 03:50:36.722]  Until researchers began coming out with the truth and the books and the evidence.
[03:50:36.722 --> 03:50:48.810]  And it piled up higher and higher and higher until that special unit senator at LAPD stank to high heaven.
[03:50:48.810 --> 03:50:51.552]  But nothing changed.
[03:50:51.552 --> 03:50:55.695]  The Patsy was the Patsy.
[03:50:55.695 --> 03:50:58.317]  And the public, well he must have been the guy.
[03:50:58.317 --> 03:50:59.018]  After all,
[03:51:00.126 --> 03:51:01.728]  The evidence must have been overwhelming.
[03:51:01.728 --> 03:51:03.470]  No, the evidence wasn't overwhelming.
[03:51:03.470 --> 03:51:05.232]  It never was overwhelming.
[03:51:05.232 --> 03:51:06.614]  It was nowhere to begin with.
[03:51:06.614 --> 03:51:09.597]  That's the way it is.
[03:51:09.597 --> 03:51:17.707]  And so as we see the leaking of more and more information in the Vegas shooter case about this guy and his life and his background,
[03:51:18.846 --> 03:51:27.547]  Yeah, I think, you know, I'm going to plan this incredible event where I'm going to kill all these people in about six months and maybe a year.
[03:51:27.547 --> 03:51:37.309]  I'm really going to work it out so that the final, as the curtain falls, it's going to be my suicide by cop.
[03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:38.009]  Mm hmm.
[03:51:38.009 --> 03:51:39.430]  That's what I really want.
[03:51:39.430 --> 03:51:43.910]  I'm a millionaire, retired real estate investor.
[03:51:43.910 --> 03:51:46.051]  Could do anything I want to.
[03:51:46.051 --> 03:51:47.951]  But this is really what I want to do.
[03:51:49.684 --> 03:51:51.544]  Sure.
[03:51:51.544 --> 03:51:53.505]  Now, does that kind of thing ever happen?
[03:51:53.505 --> 03:51:55.085]  Yes, it could.
[03:51:55.085 --> 03:52:01.686]  But I mean, if you're a serious investigator in this case, you aren't going to accept that at face value.
[03:52:01.686 --> 03:52:03.267]  Are you kidding?
[03:52:03.267 --> 03:52:08.848]  That this would be the guy to plan all this and carry it out?
[03:52:08.848 --> 03:52:13.829]  For the purpose of suiciding himself by cop?
[03:52:13.829 --> 03:52:14.709]  Are you serious?
[03:52:16.431 --> 03:52:17.951]  Okay, he was taking value.
[03:52:17.951 --> 03:52:22.293]  Yes, we know that in certain people that causes more aggressive behavior.
[03:52:22.293 --> 03:52:24.253]  Impulsively aggressive.
[03:52:24.253 --> 03:52:35.536]  That's not the same thing as a long-range plan to cause tremendous human destruction at the end of which he is killed by the cops.
[03:52:35.536 --> 03:52:40.377]  Now, some stories are now saying, well, he had an escape plan, you know, patched.
[03:52:40.377 --> 03:52:41.517]  It just didn't work out.
[03:52:41.517 --> 03:52:42.758]  Oh, sure.
[03:52:42.758 --> 03:52:43.798]  Are you kidding me?
[03:52:44.625 --> 03:52:53.348]  This guy, if he had ever managed to escape that suite, would have been hunted down for the rest of his life.
[03:52:53.348 --> 03:53:01.050]  That's the existence that he wanted, that would have ended with his being killed or put in chains and dragged back.
[03:53:01.050 --> 03:53:03.131]  I don't think so.
[03:53:03.131 --> 03:53:03.831]  Makes no sense.
[03:53:05.009 --> 03:53:12.092]  It certainly doesn't make enough sense to say, we bow down to the major police media, we accept whatever you say.
[03:53:12.092 --> 03:53:16.733]  If you say it was a lone shooter, it had to be a lone shooter, no question about it.
[03:53:16.733 --> 03:53:23.196]  We don't want to listen to the police video, audio of multiple shooters being reported by multiple cops.
[03:53:23.736 --> 03:53:34.105]  We don't want to listen to the audio of the taxicab video out in front of the Mandalay Hotel that shows multiple weapons being used despite the echo effects.
[03:53:34.105 --> 03:53:36.367]  No, we don't want to know any of that.
[03:53:36.367 --> 03:53:43.593]  All we want to know is what does media, major media, tell us that we will obey?
[03:53:43.593 --> 03:53:45.114]  Really?
[03:53:45.114 --> 03:53:48.477]  That seesaw is really flopping over, folks.
[03:53:49.662 --> 03:53:56.547]  There is now a huge rising tsunami of people that don't buy in.
[03:53:56.547 --> 03:54:01.932]  Do not buy in to these police press conferences forever.
[03:54:01.932 --> 03:54:05.154]  Well, yes, it looks like he, you know, probably had help.
[03:54:05.154 --> 03:54:07.716]  Yes, okay, we'll go with that now.
[03:54:07.716 --> 03:54:08.897]  Yes, okay.
[03:54:08.897 --> 03:54:09.758]  We're on the case.
[03:54:09.758 --> 03:54:11.439]  We're determining the motive.
[03:54:11.439 --> 03:54:15.602]  We may never find out the motive, but, you know, what could have made this man so sick?
[03:54:21.783 --> 03:54:24.024]  What about the multiple shooter?
[03:54:24.024 --> 03:54:34.811]  How about telling us once and for all the actual gun that Paddock supposedly was using or the guns in the broken windows in the Mandalay?
[03:54:34.811 --> 03:54:38.593]  What about shooters on the ground?
[03:54:38.593 --> 03:54:42.015]  That's a subject I don't have time to get into in depth here.
[03:54:42.015 --> 03:54:44.296]  But what about that possibility?
[03:54:44.296 --> 03:54:48.719]  Shooters at the concert on the ground.
[03:54:48.719 --> 03:54:50.460]  And I'll give you a for instance.
[03:54:53.609 --> 03:54:55.490]  Here it is.
[03:54:55.490 --> 03:55:09.981]  Go look at all the video you could find of the melee and the confusion and the chaos on the ground at the concert and tell me how many bullet ricochets you hear.
[03:55:09.981 --> 03:55:11.662]  Understand what that is?
[03:55:11.662 --> 03:55:16.966]  A bounce from a high-powered weapon.
[03:55:16.966 --> 03:55:22.070]  Because with all of the rounds purportedly fired down at the crowd,
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:35.507]  Surely in the video taken at ground level, you would hear not just a few, but many, many, many, many, many, many ricochets.
[03:55:35.507 --> 03:55:47.373]  Tremendous thuds as bullets hit solid objects and perhaps other sounds, whining sounds and bouncing sounds, all kinds of sounds.
[03:55:47.373 --> 03:55:48.774]  Where are they?
[03:55:48.774 --> 03:55:50.795]  Where are they?
[03:55:50.795 --> 03:55:50.855]  If
[03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:58.913]  All the shots were really fired from the Mandalay Bay Hotel.
[03:55:58.913 --> 03:56:05.396]  What about other shooters with, say, silenced weapons at ground level?
[03:56:05.396 --> 03:56:07.517]  What about that?
[03:56:07.517 --> 03:56:08.898]  Well, he's just speculating.
[03:56:08.898 --> 03:56:16.021]  No, no, because where are all the ricochet sounds that you should be hearing but aren't?
[03:56:16.021 --> 03:56:17.522]  That's not speculation, folks.
[03:56:19.406 --> 03:56:20.647]  You see what I'm driving at?
[03:56:20.647 --> 03:56:43.737]  I'm driving at what every reporter who's ever looked into one of these events is saying, which is, how about an actual, real, honest investigation that looks where it should look, such as where I just described?
[03:56:43.737 --> 03:56:45.098]  What about that?
[03:56:45.098 --> 03:56:47.199]  Why can't we have that?
[03:56:47.199 --> 03:56:47.639]  Why not?
[03:56:49.016 --> 03:56:50.297]  Why not?
[03:56:50.297 --> 03:56:54.401]  It's a vastly legitimate question.
[03:56:54.401 --> 03:56:59.967]  And the point that I just made about the ricochets is one that you ought to think about.
[03:56:59.967 --> 03:57:10.918]  Because if this was legit video taken at the legit concert on the ground, that's what you would be hearing in profusion.
[03:57:13.519 --> 03:57:16.963]  We've reached the end of the line here for today's show.
[03:57:16.963 --> 03:57:19.006]  This is John Rappaport for InfoWars.
[03:57:19.006 --> 03:57:22.610]  I appreciate your time and your attention.
[03:57:22.610 --> 03:57:23.772]  Stay with us.
[03:57:23.772 --> 03:57:24.453]  See you next time.
