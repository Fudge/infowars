[00:00.000 --> 00:21.200]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from the
[00:21.200 --> 00:34.680]  info wars dot com studios it's alex jones yet again info wars is at the
[00:34.680 --> 00:42.480]  very tip of the spear very cutting edge the front line of exposing real-time
[00:42.480 --> 00:47.360]  events and being proven right over and over again not only did I predict what
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.960]  was going to happen on Friday and on Sunday's broadcast we also laid out the
[00:53.960 --> 01:00.520]  fact very early on that he was being investigated for ties to radicalization
[01:00.520 --> 01:03.680]  groups because that's what law enforcement reported us on Monday
[01:03.680 --> 01:08.520]  morning that was confirmed yesterday we also said clearly he was not acting alone
[01:08.520 --> 01:12.720]  and all of my military and law enforcement experts that we've
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.720]  interviewed on-air and off-air including people like Craig Sawyer that led a
[01:17.720 --> 01:22.880]  major SEAL team said that it sounds like two different guns firing at two
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.240]  different speeds during different periods but regardless Paul Watson
[01:28.240 --> 01:32.680]  thinks for my witnesses that there's only one shooter and the media makes
[01:32.680 --> 01:37.000]  hay of that like there's some wedge and look we're not like mainstream media
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.920]  where it's monolithic and there's a cult here I hire smart people that are
[01:41.920 --> 01:47.040]  investigators and then we go dig in have different ideas about things we're not
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.820]  a cult like MSM that gets media matters or George Soros memos that's now
[01:51.820 --> 01:57.560]  admitted that's in the news today and admitting that we don't get handed down
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.600]  our talking points and then go push that that there's no Islamic connection
[02:02.600 --> 02:07.080]  even though there is and that he acted alone day one and that all gun owners
[02:07.080 --> 02:12.120]  are to blame and that everyone inside there deserve to be shot because they're
[02:12.120 --> 02:16.200]  pro-gun that's the Democratic Party talking point we don't have talking
[02:16.200 --> 02:22.000]  points here we develop ideas research that become dominant themes and get
[02:22.000 --> 02:26.160]  proven right over and over again because we're not running a cult we actually
[02:26.160 --> 02:29.680]  try to find the truth then the media will say oh look Jones is putting out
[02:29.680 --> 02:36.120]  lots of different ideas and things on this as if I'm saying five different
[02:36.120 --> 02:41.040]  things or what happened no we're war gaming it same thing goes on at a
[02:41.040 --> 02:44.400]  detective's office at any police department or the same thing goes on in
[02:44.400 --> 02:48.520]  a corporation war gaming business strategy the same thing goes on in the
[02:48.520 --> 02:53.200]  military same thing goes on the FBI that's what people do they have theories
[02:53.200 --> 02:58.440]  they have ideas they bounce things around they have focus groups that's what
[02:58.440 --> 03:04.960]  real thinking organizations do the media tells you that you're not supposed to do
[03:04.960 --> 03:10.280]  that if you go back to Monday deep state Alex Jones says deep state behind
[03:10.280 --> 03:16.040]  Vegas attack but notice there's no actual quote around that because what I said
[03:16.040 --> 03:19.960]  was it looks like a deep-state operation and ISIS is taking responsibility
[03:19.960 --> 03:25.280]  they later say I made it up that ISIS never took responsibility that's not
[03:25.280 --> 03:31.480]  true so we've got a big broadcast lined up today we've got eyewitnesses that
[03:31.480 --> 03:37.200]  were there coming on and more but there's the headline on drugs report he
[03:37.200 --> 03:45.840]  had a secret life did not act alone and was an allergy freak book to tell
[03:45.840 --> 03:54.480]  overlooking Lollapalooza so there you go ladies and gentlemen and the sheriff's
[03:54.480 --> 03:58.840]  departments come out and said didn't act alone they believe obviously had to
[03:58.840 --> 04:02.760]  have some type of help they don't believe there were two shooters but they
[04:02.760 --> 04:07.200]  believe he had help no kidding getting into the hotel for five days not being
[04:07.200 --> 04:13.080]  identified this is hiding in plain view and the target is the motive as well but
[04:13.080 --> 04:17.640]  we told you didn't act alone connections to radicalization that came from
[04:17.640 --> 04:22.720]  law enforcement sources that were in the middle of it and as usual we're proven
[04:22.720 --> 04:32.560]  correct yet again because we have the sources we have the research we have the
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.240]  history and understanding of this but Jimmy Kimmel says it's all gun owners
[04:37.240 --> 04:40.480]  fault that means Chuck E. Schumer says it because they admit Chuck E. Schumer
[04:40.480 --> 04:43.960]  programs him we've got that coming up and of course they want to ban all
[04:43.960 --> 04:50.120]  semi-autos as usual they're coming we've got Trump statements and a lot more
[04:50.120 --> 04:53.680]  today and then we've also got the Somali refugee and the terror attack last
[04:53.680 --> 04:57.880]  weekend in Canada turns out he was deported out of the United States we'll
[04:57.880 --> 05:02.480]  be back a staunch anti-fetalist Patrick Henry was opposed to the
[05:02.480 --> 05:05.720]  Constitution fearing it would become a monster that would take over not only
[05:05.720 --> 05:09.320]  the sovereign states that had created it but that it would become a tool to
[05:09.320 --> 05:14.080]  destroy individual liberty his warnings ignored have now come to pass he said
[05:14.080 --> 05:17.920]  you're not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you were to
[05:17.920 --> 05:22.520]  become a great and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for
[05:22.520 --> 05:26.240]  liberty ought to be the direct end of your government Patrick Henry warned us
[05:26.240 --> 05:30.000]  the liberties of a people never were nor ever will be secure when the
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.400]  transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them today everything the
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.640]  government does at every level is concealed from us we have trade deals
[05:38.640 --> 05:42.080]  to manage our economy but not even our elected representatives are allowed to
[05:42.080 --> 05:46.080]  see later in life Patrick Henry look back and said when the American spirit
[05:46.080 --> 05:49.920]  was in its youth the language of America was different liberty sir was the
[05:49.920 --> 05:55.320]  primary object today our primary concern is safety and comfort when we should be
[05:55.320 --> 06:24.960]  demanding liberty grandfather wars dot com i'm david night
[06:24.960 --> 06:40.640]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[06:40.640 --> 06:45.680]  we're live broadcasting worldwide i have newsweek i have time magazine i have
[06:45.680 --> 06:48.800]  the new york times i have the washington post i have the austrian american
[06:48.800 --> 06:54.800]  statesman all coming out on monday and saying i'm crazy because i believe that
[06:54.800 --> 06:59.600]  paddock did not act alone and now the sheriff's department has come out and
[06:59.600 --> 07:04.280]  said that there's no way he acted by himself and they're investigating his
[07:04.280 --> 07:09.600]  ties to radicalization in groups exactly what i told you from our sources in
[07:09.600 --> 07:13.760]  law enforcement and what did the southern parvy law center do what did the
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.240]  media matters group openly funded by soros do what are the mouth of soros do
[07:18.240 --> 07:24.080]  it said that i made that up no i have real sources i'm proven right you're a
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.440]  fraud you're a joke but before i get into all of this huge breaking news and the
[07:29.440 --> 07:33.920]  new tropical storm and all the rest of it i want to play a special report by
[07:33.920 --> 07:40.320]  paul joseph watson that breaks it all down paul joseph watson strange things
[07:40.320 --> 07:45.040]  about the vegas massacre to be clear this video contains no graphic images at
[07:45.040 --> 07:48.880]  all and the second half will be a debunking of all the stupid conspiracies
[07:48.880 --> 07:52.640]  floating around about this tragedy but first let's discuss what's yet to be
[07:52.640 --> 07:56.800]  explained who was gunman steven paddock's hotel room guest when he ordered room
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.600]  service for two people at the mandalay bay hotel four days before the massacre
[08:01.600 --> 08:07.840]  this is the receipt they see the number of guests two separate meals a code that
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.240]  means in room dining mandalay bay and table number three two one three five
[08:12.240 --> 08:17.520]  which equates to paddock's room number one three five on the 32nd floor why did
[08:17.520 --> 08:22.000]  this receipt show him in the hotel september 27 when authorities said he
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.120]  checked in september by the way hit boss
[08:25.120 --> 08:28.400]  i'm not gonna give the whole report it's on info wars dot com but since paul put
[08:28.400 --> 08:32.640]  this out yesterday and since we broke it and since drudge ran our big headline
[08:32.640 --> 08:37.520]  about receipts and somebody visited the room the sheriff's department came out
[08:37.520 --> 08:40.800]  and confirmed last night in the same press conference where they said they
[08:40.800 --> 08:44.720]  believe he didn't act alone quote there's no way he acted alone and they're
[08:44.720 --> 08:49.040]  investigating radicalization again what we first broke
[08:49.040 --> 08:52.640]  they confirmed that indeed he did have a visitor a woman
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.040]  so boom boom broke that again info wars right again
[08:57.040 --> 09:00.800]  drudge report right again real news leading the pack
[09:00.800 --> 09:09.760]  forcing msm to follow us boom boom how's it feel
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.920]  how you like this now how you like the fake news now we're the real news
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.360]  you're the fake news that's why you brand us to be what you are
[09:17.360 --> 09:19.920]  we're the resistance you're the establishment
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.920]  kimmel and all the rest of you let's go back to it
[09:23.920 --> 09:27.120]  then was it the same woman that warned concert goers
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.960]  they were about to die so there is a lady who pushed her way forward into the
[09:30.960 --> 09:35.040]  concert venue into the first row and she started messing with another lady
[09:35.040 --> 09:38.320]  and told us that we are all gonna die tonight do you know why she was saying
[09:38.320 --> 09:41.520]  that i mean was this after her fuck gosh the shots were fired or
[09:41.520 --> 09:44.720]  it was about 45 minutes before the shots were actually fired
[09:44.720 --> 09:48.640]  but then she was escorted out by security obviously this guest needs to be
[09:48.640 --> 09:52.000]  tracked down because he or she could have been in on the plot
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.760]  then we have this disturbing footage and i'm not gonna play it but before the
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.000]  bit i am about to play a man is walking through the site of the massacre
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.320]  after the shooting ends trying to draw attention to people who are still alive
[10:04.320 --> 10:07.520]  so they can get medical treatment it's horrific it's chilling
[10:07.520 --> 10:10.560]  but it proves that many people who lay there dying
[10:10.560 --> 10:15.520]  were still alive then this happens no EMTs they've turned the lights off
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.920]  where are the EMTs why are the lights off? turn the lights off to secure the area
[10:19.920 --> 10:24.560]  shooting's already stopped shooting was that was going on during the shooting
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.480]  now we need lights to assess victims and assign EMTs
[10:28.480 --> 10:32.320]  okay everybody right now they're here on ground is deceased
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.320]  no they're not i got EMTs working on the guy here i got EMTs working on the guy
[10:36.320 --> 10:40.000]  here i got an EMT and another is working on the guy over here
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.640]  i need lights on if you know how to do that get these lights back on
[10:44.640 --> 10:48.080]  okay so whoever made the decision to turn off the lights
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.040]  did that prevent dying victims from getting help or was it a rational
[10:53.040 --> 10:57.200]  decision to avoid lighting up the whole area to prevent the further
[10:57.200 --> 11:01.200]  targeting of these victims and remember the shooting was over at this point
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.480]  but you can see it from both perspectives so you be the judge
[11:04.480 --> 11:08.880]  then there's this footage of victims running in terror while one group of
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.840]  people just nonchalantly stands there one of them is even vaping as the gunshots
[11:13.840 --> 11:17.040]  go off
[11:20.080 --> 11:25.040]  the group only seems perturbed when a bullet literally almost hits them
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.320]  and perhaps they were just completely wasted but it's odd how some people
[11:34.320 --> 11:38.000]  behave differently to others in a crisis we now know that gunman
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.720]  steven paddock was prescribed diazepam more commonly known as its brand name
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.920]  valium which is linked to aggression and violent outbursts
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.000]  although paddock's massacre was obviously carefully planned in advance
[11:50.000 --> 11:54.320]  did the drug contribute in any way to his egregious act of aggression
[11:54.320 --> 11:57.840]  authorities now acknowledge that the shooter could have been radicalized
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.200]  i want to understand the motivation that you described
[12:01.200 --> 12:05.200]  okay to prevent any future incidents and you know that this person get
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.920]  radicalized unbeknownst to us and we want to identify that source
[12:09.920 --> 12:14.640]  which suggests they suspect there could be some kind of political or personal
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.240]  motive which brings us to the biggest thing yet to be explained which is of
[12:18.240 --> 12:22.160]  course the motive and if there was one given the nature of the event
[12:22.160 --> 12:26.880]  intelligence expert colonel tony schaefer was explicit in who he thought
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.280]  the gunman was targeting it's shaping up to be a very deliberate act of terror
[12:31.280 --> 12:35.760]  this individual parallels in many ways by age and pride by predisposition of
[12:35.760 --> 12:39.200]  being unstable the shooter who attacked congressman scolese
[12:39.200 --> 12:42.400]  back in june was a politically selected target the perception was there's going
[12:42.400 --> 12:44.800]  to be a lot of pro-gun folks there
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.680]  trump supporters at this concert so therefore i believe the perception was
[12:49.680 --> 12:52.240]  by the shooter that this was a legitimate target
[12:52.240 --> 12:56.560]  of political expression the very reason that hodgkinson did what he did
[12:56.560 --> 12:59.680]  and i believe paddock did what he did is because the left is now
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.080]  encouraged the use of violence as an extension and use of political speech
[13:04.080 --> 13:07.680]  those sentiments were echoed by forensic psychiatrist dr michael
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.440]  wellner who suggested that paddock's motive was to deliberately target
[13:11.440 --> 13:15.200]  conservatives and gun owners so it's a stranger mass homicide
[13:15.200 --> 13:18.400]  and a stranger mass homicide happens for one of two reasons
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.640]  either a person acting for a cause or a person acting because he wants to
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.840]  transcend notoriety and kill as many people as possible
[13:25.840 --> 13:29.600]  like a james holmes people who commit crimes for notoriety alone
[13:29.600 --> 13:34.400]  are young and he's not absolutely people who are gun enthusiasts
[13:34.400 --> 13:37.760]  and who are populists or nationalists in this country
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.160]  are dehumanized they're demonized the point is his mindset
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.000]  is that they deserve to die yes and so a person who adopts the cause maybe
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  otherwise law-abiding but he's he feels righteously justified
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.840]  that the end justifies the means you said look at the target
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.200]  and work your way backwards that's right what do country music fans and country
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.520]  music artists represent it's americana what was written on the note
[14:01.520 --> 14:05.440]  seen in paddock's hotel room why did he wire one hundred thousand dollars to
[14:05.440 --> 14:08.480]  the philippines and is the icis connection still in play
[14:08.480 --> 14:12.320]  what does his girlfriend know and why did she have two social security numbers
[14:12.320 --> 14:15.920]  why was she married to two men at the same time she would know
[14:15.920 --> 14:18.160]  everything intimately martha about what he was doing
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.440]  you cannot get past having a house full of guns
[14:21.440 --> 14:24.960]  by someone who is not in the military has no previous record of wanting to do
[14:24.960 --> 14:27.120]  things with guns all of a sudden he buys these
[14:27.120 --> 14:30.800]  and we're talking about the i've been told an estimate of a hundred
[14:30.800 --> 14:34.480]  thousand dollars worth of high-end weapons unbelievable so it's clearly
[14:34.480 --> 14:38.000]  something that if it was an attack on trump supporters that doesn't mean all
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.960]  hillary clinton voters or all leftists are to blame let's not stoop to their
[14:42.960 --> 14:47.840]  level by collectively demonizing everyone with whom we disagree like cnn
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.760]  ended today by publishing this article entitled how america has
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.800]  silently accepted the rage of white men when most of the massacre victims
[14:56.800 --> 15:00.400]  were white men next on cnn how europe has silently
[15:00.400 --> 15:03.840]  accepted the rage of muslim men would they publish that
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.840]  no so why are they publishing this stop being racist
[15:07.840 --> 15:11.760]  stop encouraging actual white supremacists and stop
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.360]  inciting violence as soon as i heard it was country music i felt relief
[15:15.360 --> 15:18.480]  white people shooting white people isn't terror it's community outreach
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.440]  yeah that kind of crap that has to stop but finding out the motive of the killer
[15:23.440 --> 15:28.400]  if there was one will help address the root cause and possibly begin to make it
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.840]  clear to people that resorting to violence just because you think
[15:31.840 --> 15:36.560]  you have the moral high ground is not acceptable in a civilized society now to
[15:36.560 --> 15:40.720]  debunking the conspiracy theories people claiming that this flash is a second
[15:40.720 --> 15:44.320]  gunman on the floor all right folks we've got to go to break and that is true
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.000]  that the flashing is a strobe light that's been debunked so the pull then
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.200]  goes into all that but the jury's still out on whether there were two
[15:51.200 --> 15:54.880]  shooters and all of my military law enforcement experts say
[15:54.880 --> 15:58.880]  they think they're hearing two guns go off it's not just an echo

[22:21.200 --> 22:23.520]  transcripts when he was first interviewed by Reuters
[22:23.520 --> 22:28.000]  oh he didn't have guns oh he would never do anything like this oh no
[22:28.000 --> 22:33.520]  he didn't lead a double life it was so nice this was impossible
[22:34.160 --> 22:40.400]  and now oh absolutely he's a total genius mastermind
[22:40.400 --> 22:45.040]  he's unstoppable my brother did this 48 hours later
[22:45.040 --> 22:51.840]  he is conclusive my brother did this period 100 percent
[22:51.840 --> 22:56.160]  that's what's going on open and shut well do i believe the brother from two
[22:56.160 --> 23:00.160]  days before or the brother of yesterday
[23:00.160 --> 23:03.520]  las vegas gunman steven paddock was not an avid gun guy at all
[23:03.520 --> 23:09.440]  didn't hunt you name it now he's a gun nut and his friends all do it
[23:09.440 --> 23:13.840]  his brother also said he took care of us he made us all rich oh he was buying
[23:13.840 --> 23:18.800]  people houses he just had all this money
[23:18.800 --> 23:23.600]  and how do you launder drug money how do you launder gun money
[23:23.600 --> 23:26.880]  and that's what our sources have been telling us for two days they said look
[23:26.880 --> 23:32.720]  at gun running look at him doing clandestine activity and boom
[23:32.720 --> 23:38.240]  that's what we're now getting he bought 33 guns in one year
[23:38.240 --> 23:43.280]  and a 600 rifle on weight of vegas is missing
[23:43.280 --> 23:50.080]  that's being reported right now now he spent decades hoarding guns did not act
[23:50.080 --> 23:57.120]  alone says the sheriff's department let's go ahead and go to his brother
[23:57.120 --> 24:00.080]  from a clip earlier in the week on monday to a clip
[24:00.080 --> 24:05.520]  yesterday and just look at the total flipping
[24:05.520 --> 24:09.440]  but but mainly how he's like someone's talking to him
[24:09.440 --> 24:15.440]  and he's screwing up his lines or he's got a mental condition i don't say that
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.080]  meanly but he's the squirreliest guy
[24:20.240 --> 24:24.160]  i've ever seen in a big event like this i mean if i was a hollywood director i
[24:24.160 --> 24:28.640]  would cast this guy as mr squirrely he'd be known in the script as
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.680]  squirrel man mr sneaky mr weasel
[24:34.240 --> 24:37.120]  so here he is
[24:37.520 --> 24:42.240]  it appears not just going off lines he memorized but he looks like a seven
[24:42.240 --> 24:46.240]  year old in their first play of captain hook not remembering his lines and you
[24:46.240 --> 24:49.760]  hear the director going
[24:49.920 --> 24:53.680]  now he swallows the alarm clock
[24:54.400 --> 24:59.760]  or now say i'll get you peter pan oh now i'll get you peter pan is that what
[24:59.760 --> 25:03.760]  you can hear him being fed the lines by an earpiece or
[25:03.760 --> 25:06.320]  he's like one of those guys you see on the street corner that's talking to
[25:06.320 --> 25:09.760]  themselves here it is every week you use the craze
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.000]  people genius do you think that i'm once i'm sorry i mean that's the thing i
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.600]  shouldn't have said but that's what people are i mean that he's this
[25:17.600 --> 25:21.120]  you know but he's a highly intelligent what i mean there's
[25:21.120 --> 25:24.240]  absolutely no and this is the other part that i want to stress with this
[25:24.240 --> 25:27.200]  that i mean it doesn't matter that they won't chase people but
[25:27.200 --> 25:29.520]  people are saying oh you must have had help
[25:29.520 --> 25:34.880]  steve had no help steve didn't take help it did not take a village for steve
[25:34.880 --> 25:40.720]  steve was an arm i'm sorry please don't
[25:40.720 --> 25:44.080]  i'm using a colloquial i was about to use a colloquial term that
[25:44.080 --> 25:50.560]  would besmudge one of the armed forces steve was a standalone guy
[25:50.560 --> 25:58.240]  okay steve if if you wanted to hang out with steve you hung out with steve but
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.160]  you had to understand steve was a little quirky
[26:02.160 --> 26:06.160]  here i mean here's the story you know here's how steve is
[26:06.160 --> 26:10.080]  i would go you know when i was flying or whatever if he was in town and i happened
[26:10.080 --> 26:13.840]  to be flying over i'd stop in where you know we'd go to the hotel and stay at
[26:13.840 --> 26:16.640]  the hotel for a couple days or something and sit under the cabana or
[26:16.640 --> 26:23.840]  something like that but with steve it was it was like

[32:47.440 --> 32:50.800]  i'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive
[32:50.800 --> 32:55.040]  filters that didn't do as good a job find out why this system is so
[32:55.040 --> 32:59.520]  revolutionary today at infowarstore.com
[33:02.080 --> 33:06.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:12.160 --> 33:15.280]  i have sworn upon the altar of god
[33:15.280 --> 33:21.760]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
[33:21.760 --> 33:31.200]  thomas jefferson it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[33:36.880 --> 33:40.720]  ladies and gentlemen we are here broadcasting worldwide i'm your host
[33:40.720 --> 33:44.320]  alex jones and i'm going to suspend the coverage
[33:44.320 --> 33:48.240]  of what happened in vegas for this segment because i have breaking news and
[33:48.240 --> 33:52.320]  analysis of the highest importance for everybody
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.320]  that will save millions of people's lives if you'll simply
[33:56.320 --> 34:01.760]  listen to me this is a critical emergency alert
[34:03.280 --> 34:06.240]  and it's just an example of how the literature is totally known and the
[34:06.240 --> 34:10.480]  doctors completely know this and won't tell you until they understand you've
[34:10.480 --> 34:17.440]  got an acute issue and the next time there's a good chance you will die
[34:17.440 --> 34:22.400]  this is key because they only tell you this when they know you're on the edge
[34:22.400 --> 34:25.680]  but they don't tell you because in their training in the health department brain
[34:25.680 --> 34:29.200]  washing they tell them yes we know vaccines kill a
[34:29.200 --> 34:31.760]  bunch of people yes we know they brain damage people
[34:31.760 --> 34:35.280]  yes we know they cause autoimmune problems yes we know they cause
[34:35.280 --> 34:39.200]  type 1 diabetes yes we know they cause hundreds of neurological disorders
[34:39.200 --> 34:43.360]  but for the greater good we have to lie to the public and say safe and effective
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.040]  but if they have a bad reaction
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.280]  an autoimmune reaction we've got to tell them
[34:51.280 --> 34:56.000]  you can't take the vaccine again it'll probably kill you next time
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.960]  now i hadn't seen one of our crew in a few days
[35:00.960 --> 35:04.640]  and they said well since some of us have been sick she was kind of sick
[35:04.640 --> 35:07.280]  so and i'm not going to say her name she was going to tell the story
[35:07.280 --> 35:10.960]  she's going to be out of this office for a while i'm just busy i go okay
[35:10.960 --> 35:15.040]  whatever then i see her in the coffee room wearing a mask and i said what
[35:15.040 --> 35:18.720]  happened to you she said well i took the typhoid vaccine they recommend
[35:18.720 --> 35:21.520]  by the way they make you take that to go to college
[35:21.520 --> 35:25.840]  bunch of other really really dangerous ones meningitis vaccines you name it
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.400]  which by the way the inserts say don't even protect you viral or bacterial
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.000]  and i said and i said oh what happened well i took it once before it didn't do
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.120]  it at this time it made me real sick and i said yeah you take it a third time
[35:37.120 --> 35:40.720]  it might kill you and she goes no that's exactly what the doctor said he said
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.040]  don't ever take in a vaccine again you just can't take vaccines again
[35:45.040 --> 35:51.600]  now how did i tell her the default exact thing her doctor told her because
[35:51.600 --> 35:57.200]  there's handbooks it's not my opinion i'm not that smart
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.520]  i'm just crazy enough to go up against these people
[36:03.520 --> 36:06.800]  every year in early august they have articles all over the newspapers that
[36:06.800 --> 36:10.800]  are paid for by the vaccine companies they pay to run these
[36:10.800 --> 36:14.720]  as ads they call them advertorials they don't tell you it's paid for by them
[36:14.720 --> 36:17.440]  it's really illegal
[36:17.920 --> 36:21.520]  one time i was talking about this in the local paper they said how would you like
[36:21.520 --> 36:25.600]  to have advertorials stop talking about it and i had a big affiliate once when i
[36:25.600 --> 36:29.680]  was doing the san jones you please stop because that's we get a lot of our ads
[36:29.680 --> 36:33.680]  or those where it sounds like it's a hospital district or it sounds
[36:33.680 --> 36:37.520]  like it's some informational deal or it's on the news it's not news it's paid
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.040]  for the point is i know all about it
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.160]  up one side and down the other and you know how frustrating it is
[36:46.160 --> 36:49.280]  to know that they all know the vaccines are hurting you
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.120]  and in the greater good garbage isn't even true
[36:53.120 --> 36:57.360]  and the vaccine companies since 1983 have total liability protection
[36:57.360 --> 37:01.120]  and the us has the dirtiest worst vaccines in the world that even
[37:01.120 --> 37:05.760]  authorize live hiv and hepatitis to be in the factor
[37:05.760 --> 37:10.000]  eight products our government told mayor we don't care if it's
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.480]  got hiv give it to people
[37:15.760 --> 37:19.760]  now factor eight's a blood product for clotting for hemophiliacs the point is
[37:19.760 --> 37:24.320]  it's in that class of what you call you know like a vaccine
[37:24.320 --> 37:28.240]  something you're injecting into your body to fortify you because when you're
[37:28.240 --> 37:31.440]  vaccine it's a huge giant classes of nanotech
[37:31.440 --> 37:35.600]  and and and attenuated viruses and it's something they're putting in your
[37:35.600 --> 37:38.480]  body a lot of its live viruses now even reprogram
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.640]  areas the brain and by that they selectively eat certain
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.080]  receptor sites they call it the anti stress vaccines one of them or the
[37:46.080 --> 37:49.200]  anti drug addiction anti opiate vaccine it actually
[37:49.200 --> 37:53.840]  goes in and destroys the receptors in the brain
[37:53.840 --> 37:59.440]  for it except now you're going to be totally calm and never have euphoria
[37:59.440 --> 38:04.000]  what what does heroin do it imitates natural receptor sites
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.200]  like you get to some knock down dragout fight you barely survive
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.920]  for about 30 minutes you're going to be like feeling like you're on heroin
[38:13.120 --> 38:16.240]  you break your leg naturally it hurts real bad but a few minutes in you're
[38:16.240 --> 38:19.440]  like euphoric before you get to the hospital and they
[38:19.440 --> 38:24.240]  shoot you up with opium
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.800]  and they shoot you up with the medicalized garbage
[38:28.800 --> 38:33.040]  so that's why i'm so angry
[38:33.200 --> 38:36.400]  is that they say you want to go to college
[38:36.400 --> 38:39.040]  you want to go out of the country you want to do any of these things you're
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.160]  going to take all these shots and they know full well you know the officers
[38:44.160 --> 38:47.040]  in every major military from the communist chinese
[38:47.040 --> 38:50.720]  to our own military do not take the vaccines
[38:50.720 --> 38:54.400]  and when there is something dangerous out they have special laboratories
[38:54.400 --> 39:00.480]  mainly in switzerland that produce high-end vaccines that actually have
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.240]  in them what they say and will actually give you learned immunity
[39:06.240 --> 39:09.600]  artificial immunity and still may have side effects but aren't
[39:09.600 --> 39:13.680]  one one thousandth i don't know i mean just much
[39:13.680 --> 39:17.600]  less dangerous so here's how they do the argument jones believes there's no such
[39:17.600 --> 39:20.560]  thing as vaccines and that they don't work he's a christian scientist who
[39:20.560 --> 39:23.600]  believes in no medical care that's why i've had surgery on my leg and surgery
[39:23.600 --> 39:26.720]  on my other arm and broken bones and stab wounds and
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.440]  well i had surgery for a hernia last year and you know why i uh go to the
[39:31.440 --> 39:34.320]  medical doctor whenever i need to no none of that's true
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.680]  i'd have all my children with all the vaccines if they were
[39:37.680 --> 39:40.880]  tested and pure and there wasn't liability protection
[39:40.880 --> 39:44.000]  i've read the literature i know what it does
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  i know it's a eugenics operation i know they've got the doctors and nurses all
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.440]  in on it there's some good nurses you know we broke
[39:53.440 --> 39:58.160]  20 years ago that every baby at birth for now about
[39:58.160 --> 40:03.600]  47 years has blood taken and put in a un database
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.040]  we broke it there were lawsuits in texas and minnesota my listeners found out
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.440]  sued they won millions of dollars and it's now admitted so see that's what i
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.240]  did a nurse told me about that from san antonio
[40:14.240 --> 40:17.360]  that worked inside the army
[40:18.000 --> 40:23.920]  so we've had whistleblowers on from the nicu units in the last five years they
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.760]  mandated you never gave a premature baby vaccines you know can
[40:27.760 --> 40:31.520]  kill them they mandated just to get away with it
[40:31.520 --> 40:34.400]  see what they could do if one nurse is injecting kids
[40:34.400 --> 40:38.240]  and you know they're dying oh it's a big dance story but they order the nurses
[40:38.240 --> 40:41.920]  give all the premies their shots the bioethics board does
[40:41.920 --> 40:46.400]  they get all the respirators ready give them the shots
[40:46.400 --> 40:49.680]  they start dying and they put them on respirators
[40:49.680 --> 40:53.200]  we've had the nurses on we've had the nurses on
[40:53.200 --> 40:57.920]  we've had the nurses on we've had the nurses on and it's been in the news so
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.160]  when you hear me talk about this type of stuff understand your life's in your
[41:02.160 --> 41:05.600]  hands okay and the doctors know full well
[41:05.600 --> 41:09.200]  full well but see when you're 18 months old here's the coup de grace
[41:09.200 --> 41:13.280]  the final blow just like they told her if she took that shot a third time it
[41:13.280 --> 41:15.600]  probably killed her and she probably can't take
[41:15.600 --> 41:18.640]  vaccines ever again they know babies can't complain
[41:18.640 --> 41:21.920]  18 month olds why do almost all of them 18 months go autistic
[41:21.920 --> 41:26.480]  it's the third round the third insult on average is the most deadly
[41:26.480 --> 41:30.560]  and that's when the just like wasp things your first time you don't get sick
[41:30.560 --> 41:33.040]  second time you kind of do third time it might kill you
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.880]  shame deal folks autoimmune response but they don't tell you have an epi pen when
[41:36.880 --> 41:39.520]  you go in to get the vaccine because they don't want to tell you if there's
[41:39.520 --> 41:43.120]  any problem this is would you take your baby at birth and let
[41:43.120 --> 41:48.800]  12 wasp come in and sting it no of course not
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.240]  and that's much less deadly than a big old vaccine of hepatitis or
[41:52.240 --> 41:55.840]  mmr triple jab three different compounds
[41:55.840 --> 41:59.920]  and they all know every doctor i know they don't give their children vaccines
[41:59.920 --> 42:04.400]  they're in a cult giving it to you
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.160]  so they told her you take a third shot of this it'll probably kill you
[42:10.160 --> 42:14.080]  they're not going to tell a mama even when they come in the second time and
[42:14.080 --> 42:17.680]  baby has a convulsion at a year old when she comes back in six
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.600]  months later for their boosters as they were going to boost you we're going to
[42:21.600 --> 42:24.800]  help you in life no we're going to reduce your IQ by 15 points
[42:24.800 --> 42:27.520]  and then we're going to reduce it with the fluoride as well on average you'll
[42:27.520 --> 42:30.640]  have a 25 30 point less lobotomy
[42:30.640 --> 42:35.120]  americans have been given lobotomies and the government declassified it
[42:35.120 --> 42:38.640]  that's why we're so stupid we were the best
[42:38.640 --> 42:43.600]  we've been hit by chemical and biological weapons and it's a total fact
[42:43.600 --> 42:47.600]  and even good people at work here aren't sure i'm telling them the truth
[42:47.600 --> 42:54.240]  till they almost die listen to me or die listen to your common sense
[42:54.240 --> 42:58.480]  or die
[42:58.480 --> 43:02.720]  you know someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever

[47:02.560 --> 47:10.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:10.000 --> 47:27.920]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report it's alex jones
[47:27.920 --> 47:31.200]  so they've introduced legislation to ban semi-automatic
[47:31.200 --> 47:35.840]  rifles handguns most most guns they've introduced legislation to ban the bump
[47:35.840 --> 47:39.520]  stocks which had never been used in a crime that i know of until now
[47:39.520 --> 47:45.280]  it's a total knobbly less than two percent of actual crimes
[47:45.280 --> 47:48.960]  do the criminals use assault weapons for whatever reason
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.480]  usually shotguns and handguns but it doesn't matter they're projecting the
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.720]  idea that 59 dad is just the most deadly thing in the
[47:56.720 --> 48:00.960]  entire history of the world and it's terrible for those that got killed
[48:00.960 --> 48:03.760]  and terrible for those that got wounded but hundreds died a day on the
[48:03.760 --> 48:07.680]  highways are they calling for a ban of cars
[48:07.680 --> 48:12.240]  every time muslims run over people meanwhile somali refugee accused of
[48:12.240 --> 48:18.000]  canadian truck attack last sunday was ordered deported from the us
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.280]  and now canada and mexico are saying we're not taking these people
[48:21.280 --> 48:24.400]  mexico's saying they won't take the mexicans we deport back
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.480]  because they say they're criminals that was in the news last week we're like
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.240]  these people have a bunch of felonies we don't want them well we don't want them
[48:32.240 --> 48:36.000]  either it's like the cuban
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.600]  deal was a brain drain of conservatives and christians and business owners
[48:39.600 --> 48:43.920]  they were good for the u.s economy we don't want the communist cubans now
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.000]  it's the same thing you know we don't it's like mexico
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.480]  said last week they said we don't we got big problems these mexicans are sending
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.240]  back we don't want these are the bad ones
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.200]  so again they're saying these mexicans or criminals don't send them here
[49:01.200 --> 49:05.120]  there it is mexico to trump we won't take your unwanted immigrants
[49:05.120 --> 49:10.080]  including mexicans and it's jumbling up
[49:10.080 --> 49:13.280]  our state systems and bankrupting us in fact that was the headline
[49:13.280 --> 49:16.560]  mexico says they can't take mexicans back it's bankrupting them
[49:16.560 --> 49:21.360]  really it's bankrupting you
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.120]  because we're not deporting back the productive people folks we're
[49:25.120 --> 49:28.720]  deporting the criminals on average nothing's perfect but if i go to
[49:28.720 --> 49:31.760]  mexico illegally they're going to port me but i'm digressing let me get back to
[49:31.760 --> 49:36.000]  jimmy kimmel this is a guy who has up to
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.160]  seven bodyguards we've counted on video he's got guys with blocks on
[49:40.160 --> 49:44.400]  he's got armed security at his house uh i know the neighborhood kimmel lives in
[49:44.400 --> 49:46.320]  by the way i've been the neighborhood before and they've got
[49:46.320 --> 49:49.840]  armed response driving around just like pierce morgan has at his la house
[49:49.840 --> 49:53.440]  armed response vans with guys driving around in air conditioned vans
[49:53.440 --> 49:57.360]  with you know semi-auto rifles and shotguns but he says
[49:57.360 --> 50:04.000]  you're to blame so jimmy kimmel's really saying because guns exist period
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.800]  that he's to blame
[50:07.120 --> 50:11.280]  because if somebody runs over somebody with a car and kimmel still owns a car
[50:11.280 --> 50:15.760]  by extension he's guilty because a weapon was used by somebody else
[50:15.760 --> 50:20.240]  a baseball bat a car a butcher knife if he has a baseball bat a car a butcher
[50:20.240 --> 50:23.920]  knife a gun then jimmy kimmel is guilty
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.480]  by extension just like we all are this is so authoritarian
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.880]  no the crazy evil person's the problem like congressman's police said
[50:32.880 --> 50:37.280]  let's try to cue that up next after kimmel and says he believes in guns more
[50:37.280 --> 50:40.480]  because if they wouldn't have had security there and guys that were armed
[50:40.480 --> 50:43.680]  to take out the shooter he would have gotten all 15 members of congress in
[50:43.680 --> 50:46.880]  there and they could have had special elections and handed the congress
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.040]  back to the democrats and even the washington times said it appeared to
[50:51.040 --> 50:56.480]  be a hit to take out the republican insurrection of the freedom caucus at
[50:56.480 --> 51:00.640]  the republican establishment and the democrats want to stop this is a war
[51:00.640 --> 51:03.360]  you don't think trump doesn't know they're harassing all his golf club
[51:03.360 --> 51:07.600]  members and all his hotel members and all his casino members and all his
[51:07.600 --> 51:12.160]  condo members and and his people are being harassed to
[51:12.160 --> 51:15.120]  bankrupt him and now this attack in vegas is a
[51:15.120 --> 51:19.040]  cherry on top of we'll come and destroy your money
[51:19.040 --> 51:23.120]  because again trump wants a prosperity based economy
[51:23.120 --> 51:26.960]  the globalist want an economy that is based on austerity
[51:26.960 --> 51:31.040]  centralization and monopoly and that's why trump's such a center to them
[51:31.040 --> 51:34.800]  but here is the ultimate hippie crit hippie crit
[51:34.800 --> 51:39.040]  it's a new word i invented here is the hippie crip the the hollywood
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.120]  elitist uh blaming everyone who has guns but
[51:43.120 --> 51:46.400]  himself when there's videos of him waving guns around saying
[51:46.400 --> 51:50.720]  he's gonna kill me with one irresponsible but that's okay
[51:50.720 --> 51:56.800]  here is the hippie crit lost vegas where you know what happened on
[51:56.800 --> 51:59.760]  sunday night i'm not going to get deep into it again tonight i said why i had
[51:59.760 --> 52:02.560]  to say last night but i do want to say something these
[52:02.560 --> 52:06.560]  nuts who spent most of the day today on television online attacking those of us
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.400]  who think we need to do something about the fact that 59 innocent people
[52:10.400 --> 52:13.920]  you've been attacking us they say it's inappropriate to be talking about it
[52:13.920 --> 52:17.280]  because it's too soon well maybe it's too soon for you
[52:17.280 --> 52:20.960]  because deep down inside you know in your heart you know you bear some
[52:20.960 --> 52:24.160]  responsibility for the fact that almost anyone can get any
[52:24.160 --> 52:27.680]  weapon they want now you want to cover yourself until the storm of
[52:27.680 --> 52:31.200]  outrage passes you can go back to your dirty business as usual but
[52:31.200 --> 52:34.960]  it's not too soon for us because we're americans the last time i checked
[52:34.960 --> 52:40.560]  the first amendment is at least as important as the second amendment so
[52:40.560 --> 52:46.240]  cue for applause
[52:46.240 --> 52:49.120]  so he's acting like we're trying to stop his free speech
[52:49.120 --> 52:52.080]  when they're the ones trying to set up a ministry of truth to shut down
[52:52.080 --> 52:56.000]  conservative and libertarian talk radio television and internet
[52:56.000 --> 53:00.560]  naming info wars dot com and drudge report dot com is the first two
[53:00.560 --> 53:03.920]  they want the federal election commission be shut down run by their
[53:03.920 --> 53:08.240]  little buddy chucky schumer who admittedly puts the direct talking
[53:08.240 --> 53:13.760]  points into his head every show now when he reads off that teleprompter
[53:13.760 --> 53:17.280]  with that studio audience cued for applause he's reading
[53:17.280 --> 53:22.400]  what chucky schumer sent him in an email he admits that
[53:22.400 --> 53:25.520]  so now you're not just a puppet your chucky schumer's puppet you're a
[53:25.520 --> 53:30.720]  hypocrite you're a joke now here's kimmel
[53:31.920 --> 53:37.760]  making fun of himself with guns playing around with guns something
[53:37.760 --> 53:41.760]  hollywood does something that they do teaching people to act irresponsible
[53:41.760 --> 53:45.440]  with firearms so here he is as a again just another layer
[53:45.440 --> 53:50.080]  of fraud here it is i've been reading comments from people say this is
[53:50.080 --> 53:52.400]  terrible but there's nothing we can do about it
[53:52.400 --> 53:56.160]  but i disagree with that uh intensely because of course there's something we
[53:56.160 --> 53:59.120]  can do about it there are a lot of things we can do about it
[53:59.120 --> 54:01.840]  um
[54:01.840 --> 54:04.880]  you're a killing machine
[54:04.880 --> 54:10.560]  see you guys tomorrow have a good one you nailed it all five right through the
[54:10.560 --> 54:17.120]  heart the juice of these pickles is on you alex jones
[54:17.120 --> 54:23.440]  unto a drone is a very bad idea but it's also kind of awesome kill everyone in
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.680]  china yeah that's an interesting idea then he fired at
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.000]  my head and i fired a million shots okay and i have pretty tight security around
[54:32.000 --> 54:36.160]  here
[54:40.160 --> 54:45.600]  and to everyone affected by this terrible event i i'm sorry for getting
[54:45.600 --> 54:49.200]  emotional i'm i'm not great with this kind of
[54:49.200 --> 54:51.840]  thing i believe that abraham lincoln had a vision
[54:51.840 --> 54:55.840]  about what the republican party would become in 150 years
[54:55.840 --> 54:58.800]  and he shot himself
[54:58.800 --> 55:08.960]  jimmy kimmel is the definition of a hypocrite a fraud
[55:09.520 --> 55:19.280]  of a fop he's not his own man he is a puppet of his daddy
[55:19.760 --> 55:25.120]  chuckie schumer he is the mouth of chuck schumer telling us give me your
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.520]  guns while he has all his bodyguards incredible

[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:55.600]  there as well so much so i forgot uh and gave out their number
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.280]  like i forgot some other things this week uh but
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.800]  we now have the number i've been using for the sunday show for hard to believe
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.280]  almost 10 years i've been doing the sunday show

[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:13.520]  is the new number to call us live on air and we've got 40 phone lines on that
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.120]  system so it is a little bit better than gcm with five phone lines
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.280]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.880]  eight seven seven seven eight nine a lex and we will get you up
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:33.680]  and on the air on vegas specifically and the attack on the second amendment
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.280]  i'd like it to be first time callers to give folks a chance to get into the
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.040]  show who haven't been able to get on the broadcast before
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.320]  so that is coming up also donors of the anti-trump resistance group
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:55.680]  revealed it's a uh big story uh that's uh well all over the news
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.120]  washington free beacon zero hedge and others
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:03.840]  soros kelog ford donor list of anti-trump resistance group
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.800]  revealed again they call themselves their resistance because they know you're
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.680]  the resistance i'm the resistance and they're a bunch of plagiarists they're
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:14.560]  a bunch of frauds they're a bunch of counterfeiters
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.600]  they know we're kicking their butt we've got a beachhead in washington it isn't
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:22.640]  perfect it's ragtag it's a train wreck but culturally
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.720]  we're promoting americana and they know they can't beat that so they are
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.760]  panicking right now big time and that's an interesting article i'm going to be
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.480]  going over i promise it's begun mother jailed for refusing to vaccinate
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.120]  her son up in michigan i really like michigan but man
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.040]  talk about a nanny state they're in the collapsing cities uh they are really
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:49.200]  pushing it and that's very very dangerous uh precedent
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.640]  so we're going to break that down also trump tells the senate intel committee
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.800]  should investigate fake news media not the supposed fake news the russians are
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.360]  funding the senate committee came out yesterday and said
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.880]  we'll keep investigating russia but so far we found
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:10.480]  nothing not even a shred no russia involvement in the election
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.880]  but they claimed some russian company bought some ads in a couple states on
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.080]  facebook talking about ferguson well of course there's
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:26.000]  going to be foreign think tanks and groups our government spent tens of
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  billions of dollars a year that's public trying to overthrow the russian
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.160]  government inside russia and russia only manned it last year
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.040]  and then they have people on fox news is seeing them going
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.480]  we just can't believe the russians tried to get involved in the election by
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.400]  buying ads it's just unprecedented it's an act of war
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.560]  no an act of war is having george soros try to overthrow every country on their
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.000]  border and actively have georgia start a war
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.640]  in 2008 and actively try to overthrow the moscow government that's elected i
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.880]  mean they admit that in c-span hearings
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.480]  that they spent five billion dollars overthrowing ukraine
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.080]  and an elected government i mean they are just in russia's face just punching
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.840]  russia in the nose and then going i can't believe
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.160]  you're trying to restrain my fist from smashing any you're abusing my fist

[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.080]  talk everything vegas what happens in vegas
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:34.720]  doesn't stay in vegas you've got that tomb out in the desert
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.240]  that's what i probably call it when i've been there
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.240]  is a giant tomb of the solace and i understand it's the only place you can
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.040]  go to see george straight i understand that it's the only
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:48.240]  place you can go to see motley crew i mean those are just examples of
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:51.040]  all these huge incredible country music groups
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.280]  hip-hop groups you name it rock and roll groups
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.640]  they retire but then they do shows in vegas
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.480]  just like elvis used to do he started that or i guess frank sinatra
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.840]  so i could see if frank sinatra was still alive or johnny cash and they only
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.920]  played in vegas going to vegas but i just don't like the gambling
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.280]  i don't like all the soullessness that goes on
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.400]  it's not that i'm some square who can't handle it
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.560]  i pick up on the emptiness the desperation
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:26.640]  the soullessness and it's just very archetypal to see all those beautiful
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:31.120]  people all those beautiful souls gulping like fish out of water
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:37.600]  fading out like a setting sun as blood comes out of their mouths lying in piles
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:44.960]  of beer cans and starbucks cups and potato chip packages and hot dog
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.520]  half eaten hot dogs i mean i was transfixed in a nightmare
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.960]  watching the videos people shot while they were
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.400]  you know rendering aid but also had their cameras on their gopros on
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:01.520]  to document it and then meanwhile outrage yesterday after vermont
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.560]  newspaper runs cartoon of dead bodies in hopes of gun control conversation
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:13.040]  what happens in vegas and they said we want to discuss the gun control
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.960]  well if you didn't have all the gun grabbers with their own guns and their
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.160]  own security guards and and promoting violence through
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:24.000]  hollywood and even jimmy kimmel saying i'll kill you alex
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.040]  jones and pointing a gun at me and saying this is a message
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.320]  and pulling the trigger shut up about hillary clinton
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.160]  imagine if i did that with a gun and said it's a message to you kimmel
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.240]  i mean it'd be jones threatens kimmel but kimmel comes out
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:44.160]  with this forced crying he walks out on stage his eyes are already watering
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.240]  he can tell he's put some type of pepper uh in him
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.240]  and then the fake crying begins and if he admits he gets scripts from
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.080]  chuckie schumer every day it's loaded the teleprompter and he
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:01.760]  even admits it oh you want to kill my son if you
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:05.600]  don't let him have obama kids written by big banks to screw you
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.040]  i'm the worst actor on earth and then if you don't agree with it oh you hate his
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:12.400]  son you want to kill his son
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.280]  i mean it's just ridiculous and now oh you're trying to violate my first
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.440]  amendment no when you come out and say band guns
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.560]  you come out and jump on it day one like hillary
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.720]  we're saying you know you really shouldn't be exploiting this day one
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.920]  until we know more that doesn't mean you don't have free speech
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.360]  my free speech is i can criticize you but they always spin that oh you're
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.320]  trying to suppress my free speech when they're the ones with the new ministry
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.520]  of truth they're the ones wanting the federal elections commission to ban
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:42.640]  info wars and drudge report i mean that's public
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:48.560]  now that's off the table now for now but they're the ones saying ban hate
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.800]  speech ban the free speech of the right wing
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.960]  they're the ones saying we're all white supremacists they're the bullies
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.080]  he's the one with all the bodyguards
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.440]  and then all of the usual suspects i've got a bunch of these clips but
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.240]  here it is one more time before i go to your phone calls because
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.280]  this illustrates the total hypocrisy and again uh the fake crying all of it here
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.320]  it is lost vegas where you know what happened on
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.280]  sunday night i'm not going to get deep into it again tonight i said what i had
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.080]  to say last night but i do want to say something these
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.920]  nuts who spent most of the day today on television online attacking those of
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.400]  us who think we need to do something about the fact
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.120]  that 59 innocent people were killed they say again
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.040]  let me decipher that from the office of chuck shimmer literally
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.240]  written in an email or in phone calls this is admitted
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.520]  to him he's very proud that he talks to schumer daily he tells him what to say
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.200]  that's his words schumer tells me what to say
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:48.240]  what he's saying is we're the ruling class we want you disarmed we've all got
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.080]  bodyguards and guns and brag about it in other videos we're about to show you
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:56.320]  but you the pro you the slave you the underclass you don't get to have that
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.840]  like in chicago new york or dc we're going to feed on you
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.920]  and we the criminal class are going to control you and when we come out and
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.800]  cry and say you're to blame and we want your guns
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.040]  and then you respond by saying no here's the statistics don't take our rights
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.920]  oh then you turn it around that we've taken your right
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:21.840]  this is lies upon twisting upon to spin upon deception and then all over again
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:26.560]  so now he acts like he's defending the second amendment by the first amendment
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.960]  he's now the defender of the rights when he's trying to take the right away and
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.000]  the group he represents wants to take all our free speech
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.440]  this is a danger this puppet this teleprompter reader this isn't kimmel
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.520]  but the mouth this facsimile it's like you had a cut out
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.200]  of kimmel and then in between it you got sorrows like this it looks like kimmel
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.680]  but it's sorrows oh yeah take the guns and they don't like
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.320]  first amendment either they're the ones that are against the rights yeah yeah
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.480]  yeah yeah let me close shot on four
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:05.200]  hi oh this is this is shucky sure oh i mean i'm sorry i'm jimmy kimmel
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:10.480]  hi yeah oh we're not elitists and have our own guns and bodyguards but we do
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.680]  you can't have yours and if you disagree with me or project my first
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.720]  amendment you know i'm the one taking your second amendment
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.120]  and partly wanting to get rid of the first so let's let's let's hear from
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:24.560]  shucky schumer that start shucky schumer over in fact from now on
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:30.640]  he's how do you combine kimmel and schumer
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.080]  i mean i guess it's chuck jimmy kimmel schumer that's it
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.320]  so he will now his fourth be known as chuck jimmy kimmel
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.520]  schumer what do you call it when you combine
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.600]  brad pit and angeline joley they have a name
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.160]  but but that's not good enough here it's just chuck jimmy kimmel
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:57.200]  schumer so so let's hear from the literal puppet here it is
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.480]  lost vegas where you know what happened on sunday night i'm not going to get
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.680]  deep into it again tonight i said what i had to say last night but i do want to
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.320]  say something by the way stop again that's another lie he knows you're
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:09.360]  tuning out like the nfl tuning out for political correctness
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.240]  he knows so he's lying because they did it throughout the show
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.120]  so he's like don't leave stay stay stay i'm not being political i'm not beating
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.720]  over the head see it's all lies he it's pure lies started over

[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:33.520]  say something these nuts who spent most of the day today on television online
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.880]  attacking those of us who think we need to do something about the fact
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:41.040]  that 59 you just called you a nut they say it's inappropriate to be talking
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.280]  about it because it's too soon well maybe it's too soon for you
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.960]  because deep down inside you know in your heart you know you bear some
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.160]  responsibility for the fact that almost anyone can get any
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.920]  weapon they want again but back it up two seconds
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:02.080]  no i don't feel guilt i feel pride and responsibility and that america is one
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.120]  of the freest countries in the world like switzerland and that we have a second
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.120]  amendment to protect ourselves from corrupt elites like you and i'm proud i
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.640]  have a platform to stand up against a vicious evil
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.880]  shell out mercenary dirt bag anti-american piece of garbage
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.560]  like you kimmel who would have the nerve to read off the teleprompter
[01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.720]  and tell me that i'm responsible for these dead people
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.320]  and these wounded people you are the biggest guilt-tripping
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.280]  piece of garbage i've ever seen chucky schumer
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:38.080]  chuck kimmel schumer back to you for you because deep down inside you know in
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.160]  your heart you know you bear some responsibility no the fact that almost
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.520]  anyone can get any weapon they want now you want to cover yourself
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.480]  until the storm of outrage passes you know we don't cover ourselves from
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.440]  storms of outrage we go into those storms to tell the truth
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.040]  honorably we don't care about the crowd we don't care about intimidation we
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.760]  don't care about brainwashing because we're leaders
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.080]  we're like the north star we stand for something and that's our integrity
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.720]  kimmel we don't read off teleprompters we're our
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.520]  own men kimmel back to kimmel cover yourself
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.120]  until the storm of outrage passes you can go back to your dirty business as
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:22.720]  usual but oh oh we're in dirty businesses
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:26.880]  just like they've had oberman come out and say
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.560]  gun owners are terrorists period and what do you do to them you lock them up
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.240]  oh but jimmy kimmel as a gun owner he's not a terrorist oh no no no no no it's
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.280]  like pigs and animal farm they can walk on two legs
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.600]  two legs bad four legs good except when they're on two legs
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:47.200]  then it's two legs is okay right right you think you've killed logic
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.920]  you think you've lowered our IQ you think you've won
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.720]  there's still enough of us that know who you are enemy
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.240]  we've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:04.240]  own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.360]  systems that god gave us through mother nature to detoxify the body
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:12.240]  that's why i'm introducing z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.360]  it's made in the usa it's filled with known
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.880]  compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:22.720]  the body and it supports the info or it is a classical 360 win
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.720]  this is the formula that i personally have been taking for over a year and now
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.280]  we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.640]  as you can possibly get you want to yourself you want to your family and you
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.280]  owe it to the future of this country in the world
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.960]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.880]  as you can be because we need you the remnant of america
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.720]  to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as

[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.800]  we're changing the world now it's time to change our bodies with z shield
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.160]  info wars live dot com jovix here with info wars
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.160]  dot com today i want to talk to you about guns why we have them
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.520]  why the bill of rights guarantees that we can have them
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:09.120]  and why my right to have a gun is more important than your right
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:13.280]  to rail against it in the press i believe every good journalist needs to
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.280]  know why the second amendment must be considered more essential than the
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.480]  first amendment this may be a bitter pill to swallow
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:25.520]  but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated dusty idea some old
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.800]  dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:34.880]  no it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776 the original
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.080]  amendments we refer to as the bill of rights contain 10 of what the
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.920]  constitutional framers termed unalienable rights the bill of
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.560]  rights came to us with blinders on it doesn't recognize color or class or
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.680]  wealth it protects not just the rights of actors or
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.600]  editors or reporters but extends even to those we love to hate
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.520]  this is a small excerpt from trawlton heston
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.800]  not a group you develop living defense for us it took you over a year to do it
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.120]  why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:09.680]  pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.280]  put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.440]  right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.520]  that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.040]  the refugees uh spreading disease around we have

[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.960]  would i recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right

[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:23.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:29.200]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:43.120]  live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones
[01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:46.240]  you know i've said a lot of really mean things about jimmy chemo
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.560]  even after he did the whole joke piece about how he wanted to kill me
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:54.640]  i was good-humored about it because i'm a good-humored person
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:57.920]  but he's now saying that gun owners are dirty bad people
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.320]  and that we're responsible for those murders in vegas
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.320]  that is an incredibly dangerous precedent that's like saying it but
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.200]  jihadi runs over a couple hundred people in
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:14.240]  niece and how many people to kill like 80 something
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.160]  that somehow people that drive delivery trucks
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.680]  are in a dirty business and somehow they're guilty or if somebody stabs
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:25.680]  somebody to death with a butcher knife
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:34.720]  that we're guilty that is so fraudulent and i reject it
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.600]  and i reject chuckie schumer that is the brain
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.960]  of chemo but all the shows have gone political because they're losing control
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:48.000]  and they know it's hurting their ratings but they don't care they know it
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.320]  drove cnn and msnbc into the ground and they
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.200]  know it's driving hbo into the ground and they know that they're getting one
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:59.280]  star votes uh on netflix and all the other platforms but
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.880]  they just remove the stars off of those particular programs
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.960]  so you can't vote because they're going to force feed you
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.640]  and that's what jimmy chemo should know megan kelly
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.880]  was the second most popular person on fox news sometimes the most popular
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.320]  she went from being a mild conservative to being her true
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.960]  globalist liberal control freak personage and
[01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:27.760]  donald trump crippled her and even though she tried to destroy me
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.000]  just the fact that she set herself up against the populist movement
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.120]  even though the interview made me look like hell
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:38.960]  everyone rejected her in the process and her ratings went down
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:45.600]  70% and now her new show is floundering
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:49.200]  and even mainstream media admits
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:55.200]  that donald trump and alex jones killed megan kelly's career but that's not
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:01.840]  really even accurate she killed her own career
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.560]  and the people that put her in that position knew what they were doing
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.600]  if it worked if she was successful then good
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:14.560]  but they knew five to one
[01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:19.680]  then it'd be over for her but she was so narcissistic
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:25.920]  she had no idea she was walking in front of a political firing squad
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:33.920]  and tom brokaw i've got clips of him with megan kelly running around demonizing
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.960]  all gun owners i'm going to play that clip coming up it's
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:42.400]  sickening to have these criminals and in my view they're criminals working for
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.280]  the big corporate media getting taxpayer money
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.800]  through the subsidiaries through the stimulus programs
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:53.280]  trying to steal our basic civil rights you try to violate somebody's first
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.920]  amendment it's racketeering you try to take somebody's second amendment it's
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.080]  racketeering you break in somebody's house try to
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:02.320]  surveil them without a warrant you violated the fourth it's criminal
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.440]  and it is a civil rights violation with this big combine of bullies
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:11.840]  getting together trying to intimidate us and peck at us and name call us and
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:16.880]  censor us and boycott us until we give in to them
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.240]  well i think they've noticed that the american people are finally awake they
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.280]  took the fact we were sleeping that we were playing
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.480]  now we're awake and they're going oh my gosh we're dealing with a
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.840]  world champion donkey yes ladies and gentlemen
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:39.680]  the american spirit is like that of a jackass and that's why the democrats
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.640]  used to have that as their logo they're totally different party than they were
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.760]  in thomas jefferson's date and by the civil war the whole donkey thing
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.200]  appeared by meaning they were stubborn it was seen as a stubborn
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.640]  hard-nosed smart animal that wasn't going to be pushed around
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:25:00.480]  and now they're realizing that the american people
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.000]  are like a cross between a donkey and an elephant big and strong
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.440]  and dedicated and slow to anger like an elephant
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.440]  but once you get one mad look out
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.080]  so see all the symbols of what america is they've stolen
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.920]  and we're taking those symbols back like i'm thinking about making my symbol
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:24.240]  be a jackass because you're not gonna make me do
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.320]  anything i don't want to do and the more you bully me and the more you attack me
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:31.920]  the more i'm gonna attack back oh and watch what's happening
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.240]  i'm basing what i do in americana and truth and justice and freedom
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:39.840]  you're basing all your garbage and fraud
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.280]  and so what's happening to you you're losing support you're getting weaker
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.560]  we're getting stronger and info wars is just one focal point
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:50.480]  one manifestation there's so many new great minds popping up of every color
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.840]  of every creed all part of the human race that you're in full panic mode
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.440]  we're gonna go to zack chris jeff patricia paul jesse kim and others

[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:17.040]  everyone at multiple hospitals now remember they do this all the time the
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.000]  personal touch and the media says oh he didn't really
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.520]  visit his police and they even said yesterday oh
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.120]  he's not really visiting people but i know folks that know trump he'll call
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.440]  sometimes he's in the hospitality business
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:35.120]  his real money was made in condos these cells and rents
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:41.840]  that trump will make 500 phone calls to people renting
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.640]  just to make sure they're happy because he has tens of thousands renting from
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.280]  him now he can't do that as much as president now but he's the type of guy
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:53.120]  when i got married january remarried he called up to congratulate me we
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.640]  talked about five minutes and he wanted to talk to my wife
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:03.280]  they talked about five minutes that's when he was president
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:06.000]  and that's the kind of stuff now you don't get those calls now
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.240]  i mean some people get calls about don't worry we're not going in to take a
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.480]  sod out and don't worry we're going to get that

[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.160]  just to see them lie and say that trump never
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:30.800]  actually visits anybody it's all a fraud obama's the one that didn't go to
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:35.040]  hurricanes but again they invert reality
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.000]  look they just tried in Puerto Rico but it blew up in their face
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.160]  they were blocking it the democrats costing lives
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.560]  and of course this guy had help and he's got a leftist cutout

[01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:07.200]  from my sources and they're it's all compartmentalized
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.920]  and we know trump doesn't control all these agencies and that most of the
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:13.760]  higher ups are our globalist so the president is working to get
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:16.320]  information now that's why he was in vegas was also
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:19.760]  to talk to law enforcement from different agencies himself
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.360]  privately and say what really happened spill your guts on the president
[01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:28.800]  you talk about hands-on this is like john wane for real folks
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.760]  all right how long till break here got a new clock
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.200]  let's go ahead and start going to calls
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.000]  let's go ahead and talk to zack in illinois zack thanks for holding her on
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.880]  the air
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.080]  i read a lot of news and i i can't i can't even really form an opinion without
[01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.960]  reading like i mean probably five different articles
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.080]  because i mean it's not that i can't thank for myself
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.800]  but i like to get a lot of other opinions but if these people think there's
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:05.280]  only one shooter the crazy man these this church even said it yesterday
[01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:09.040]  there's no way that he could have acted alone there's no way
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:16.480]  and i i think this with with how he was like five to six hundred yards
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:20.880]  away from the festival and i he had some high powered rifles
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.080]  but i think that had been somebody through the back like
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:29.520]  um towards the mgm resort because you sir you're really you're really smart
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:32.320]  and we've been still investigating this before we release our full findings
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.960]  but i have talked to people in army intelligence in army
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:40.480]  special operations navy seals former leaders of major
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:44.640]  cell teams i mean craig soyer was a group leader
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:48.560]  cell team six i mean that's the high levels it gets and they all say
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.440]  multiple shooters different guns going off same time
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.800]  different caliber one's a full belt gun it's not a crank
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.600]  or a or a you know these these these these these
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.120]  breakstop backs that you know these jump guns or whatever they're calling them
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:05.600]  and what you're saying is absolutely on target and then we've got all these
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.360]  videos i have a five-minute compilation i'm gonna get to it for some calls
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.240]  that rob dude's uploading right now at info wars.com
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:16.240]  where it's just all the witnesses and you hear super far off it's not an echo
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.000]  boom boom boom boom boom and then right up close bam bam bam bam right beneath
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.320]  man delay so 100 percent you're hearing this
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.200]  and it looks very conclusive now it's we don't get to fight with each other
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.480]  i'm not mad at paul that a lot of eyewitnesses were on the ground say
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.720]  that they thought there was you know only uh one shooter regardless he had
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:40.000]  help regardless our sources have been accurate it's okay for all of us to have
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.520]  different theories and investigate this but mainstream media wants to tell us
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.560]  we can't watch the footage we can't look into his past
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.320]  we can't do research we're just supposed to back off and not know what happened
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.160]  and then let them blame gun owners and blame america and blame trump no we're
[01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:56.480]  not doing that we're actually investigating it and the
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:59.760]  democrats said we're coming to kill trump supporters in october
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.760]  we're going to kill you the revolution starts and i predicted it would happen
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:08.240]  and it has perfect timing and the hotel clearly
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.920]  is covering up and clearly he couldn't get all those guns in there for five days
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.960]  and they're lying about how many days he was there and the hotel has all the
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:19.760]  connections to the leftist and george soros and the quote resistance group
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.760]  as it's called what do you make of that
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:28.080]  they're opening a new mgm resort in the middle east
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:31.200]  so like this guy is definitely involved the guy who
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.280]  the people who are on the mgm they had they had to this is why eyewitnesses
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.200]  claim responsibility oh absolutely listen listen
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:43.680]  their biggest group they give to is care the bigger us muslim group
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.000]  i mean the whole thing is unbelievably stinky
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.600]  and you know who it smells like ladies and gentlemen the filthy evil

[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.560]  we're in such a critical time the globalists are trying to stop a worldwide
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.400]  populist movement they said mass terror is coming
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:34.080]  of course they want to pin it on the liberty movement
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.400]  all evidence points towards globalist deep state operatives the motive
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.920]  the target the evidence coming out we've been completely validated
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:46.080]  the globalists are upset i want to go to kim in wisconsin next
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.080]  then paul in georgia then jeff in arizona christin arizona we're gonna get to
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:54.160]  everybody but what a great caller earlier bringing up
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:58.080]  the multiple shooter situation uh i understand a lot of witnesses that were
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:01.520]  up close say it was one shooter from the hotel we get obsessed over it all day
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:04.560]  we know the guy got help the sheriff's department says that's clear
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.680]  we know he's getting radicalized we know this being covered up we know somebody
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:11.280]  was giving millions of dollars we know the hotel is in deep with the muslim
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:16.240]  brotherhood admittedly i mean this is really suspicious
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:20.880]  uh and we also know if you pull back from it
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:24.880]  that they lied about how many days he was in there and again we broke that
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:28.560]  and i'm not bragging it's just we're totally on target
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:31.120]  that's why they're so scared and trying to destroy us because we'll just
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.880]  report what's really going on we're not stupid we know the mo
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.600]  we don't know exactly what happened we know there's a cover-up going on right
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.680]  now and we know who had the motive in the history
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:44.960]  but i mean there's a particular footage that i rolled last night
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:48.560]  in uh a special broadcast i did that was internet only
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:52.720]  uh titled incredible must-see footage of second shooter
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:59.600]  and you also got police scanners uh with multiple shooters and it's not just
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.960]  confusion the lady's in a cab you hear off-farm
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:11.520]  it's a gun and then right above her right where the shooter is
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.240]  and it's not like he shoots first loud and then you hear an echo a half
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:22.560]  second later it's i'm gonna play this next hour
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:28.160]  and then she waits like a minute there's like blam blam blam blam blam
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.520]  there's no mistaking it and i'm not the military expert
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:36.160]  i've talked to a bunch of them on air and off air they say it's clear
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:39.520]  so i don't want to make it all about this though
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:43.120]  but that's where people are going so fine uh kim you're on the air from
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:46.000]  wisconsin thanks for holding
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:49.600]  hi alex uh i was just wondering your opinion on
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.360]  some of the admitted reports and i'm not insinuating anything but i think it
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.000]  should be looked into of musicians at the concert
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.560]  partying near the 32nd level in the mandalay bay
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.720]  um and also why they left the lights on and didn't say
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.240]  run for your life after the shooting started i have two other points too but
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.720]  go ahead respond to that one well i guess that was one of the sweet levels so i
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.680]  don't know about that i mean i don't think you have the musicians involved
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.400]  and then you also got them panicking leaving the lights on because they're
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:23.520]  not sitting at the switch thinking if a mass shooting happens i'm gonna turn
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:26.160]  the lights off i mean i think even some of the
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.960]  smartest minds in the world aren't just sitting right by the light switch in case
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:32.160]  the mass shooting starts thinking to pull the switch plus more people might get
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:35.360]  killed stampeding over each other in the ensuing panic
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:38.240]  so what do you think
[01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:41.840]  you know i you know it's hard to say because you can imagine yourself in the
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:44.720]  same situation you see people start dropping if you would just
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.560]  run for your life but you know the technician guys you as you know who
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:51.440]  operate the lights they're in back or they're in some booth
[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:55.360]  um like you said maybe it was just in the panic type of thing but in that video
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:58.480]  alluded to earlier the gentleman walking around
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.520]  in the uh field with the garbage on the ground
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:06.160]  he's asking uh also about the lights and how they were on during the shooting
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:13.120]  and off beforehand and um brother this thing smells
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:17.600]  like the biggest rat on planet earth okay i mean look at who owns it look who's
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:20.880]  doing it look at the timing look how the global has said they were going to
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:24.240]  start the overthrow in october uh look at all our experts predicting an
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:27.680]  attack on a big event like this to trigger it i mean we're here
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.760]  and i'm telling you a bunch more is about to happen ladies and gentlemen
[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:34.880]  i'm telling you i've seen all the evidence i feel it in my gut
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:38.640]  they're making their move what are you saying kim
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:42.160]  well you know they've done this time and time again in countries around the
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.480]  world that's right very interesting if you'll
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:47.600]  loop back to the mundanity in the 90s and start with the first
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.080]  Clinton administration with also jasmineia and the stuff there with
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.440]  the big stage shootings and how they use that to ban guns i mean
[01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:01.120]  yes this is a formulae and then use our hurt hearts of 40 50 60 dead people to
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:04.080]  then make us all feel guilty like we did it so we give up our guns
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:07.120]  that's what chemo and schumer and these dirtbags are doing good to hear from
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:11.520]  you chem gray points paul we're gonna go to georgia and talk to paul
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:15.440]  paul thanks for calling you're on the air worldwide
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:21.440]  hello yes or go ahead yeah um i just want to bring up a point
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:25.200]  steve achin it came on yesterday on david night show
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.880]  and said this whole thing didn't happen are you aware of that
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:31.520]  yeah i think it's preposterous i've watched the raw footage i've talked to
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:34.960]  folks that were there you can't fake people dying and bleeding out
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.880]  and uh i i just i'd he he he can have his opinion
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:44.240]  i can have mine but i don't buy into that well it's almost like a disinformation
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.400]  campaign if he's still working for the cia here i mean this whole thing well i
[01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.440]  think that's safe to say you know a deep state
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:57.280]  who to provoke a response this was an attack on middle america
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:01.520]  the target just like colonel schaffer said just like colonel schaffer said
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:05.840]  the target is the motive and the top psychiatrist everybody else of course
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.520]  of course us to jump the gun they want us to
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:16.080]  start shooting at blm and that's what my that's what my highest level in line
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:21.360]  mr and mrs america hand over your guns that's just that was the goal of this
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.040]  the next step is taking a shot at our president
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:31.280]  and at what point does alex jones put down the mic and pick up the gun
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:34.240]  well i always love how folks hold on let me talk now
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.920]  you're talking over me um
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.720]  i have picked up the gun information warfare is 90 percent of modern war
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.880]  okay so i'm here trying to win peacefully we are politically winning
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:53.200]  peacefully and they're you just said they're
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.680]  trying to elicit a response they just tacked flyover country bitter
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.040]  clingers middle america the left celebrating it saying you deserve to
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:05.040]  die cbs executives uh big democrats hollywood stars
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:08.320]  they're scum newspaper editors newspaper editorialists
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:12.640]  they're out there saying give us your gun scum see what it's like to get killed
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:16.160]  trying to terrorize us it's clear okay they're involved they ran it
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:20.000]  they've done it all the evidence points towards that i'm 95 percent sure
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.280]  the motive the history but then in your next breath
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.960]  when is jones gonna pick up the gun like i haven't done work
[01:54:26.960 --> 01:54:31.040]  like i haven't done enough like i'm some lazy schmo who's been fighting against
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:33.680]  america and then i'm supposed to say i'm general
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:37.840]  jones and let's saddle up and prepare for war with who
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:40.800]  the government has got good people and bad people in it we're fighting an
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:47.600]  intellectual war so uh i just it's oxymoronic to ask me when i
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:51.920]  pick up weapons uh sounds like offensively what are you saying
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.840]  now when would you tell us the time is here is what i'm saying how long when
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.240]  does info wars go off the air and go into the foxhole
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:03.200]  well i think at the point that we're a good canary in the coal mine and i don't
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.920]  say this is a dead man switch uh for my own sake uh but i mean if they
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.240]  take me down or grab me or kill me i'm not saying go out and do anything but
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:16.640]  they're coming after you next and if they kill the president
[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:19.680]  they're gonna then have a bunch of false flags to make it look like the liberty
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:23.760]  movement or terrorist or whatever to try to demonize us further so that we
[01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:27.360]  apologize they break our will we turn our guns in and they take their time
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.400]  rounding us up uh so i think people have to make their own
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:33.680]  decisions about that and they also have to understand that the police and
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:37.760]  military won't know what's going on too much during all this just like the
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:41.360]  public and so it's important to realize that if that's going on
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:45.280]  that's not your target everybody needs to be discussing who
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:49.200]  runs this who is the enemy who are the vocal figureheads of it
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:52.720]  who is quarterbacking it who is setting it up who
[01:55:52.720 --> 01:55:57.200]  who who who is the foreign force and i think
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.080]  that's why most of them have already evacuated the country because they're
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:03.520]  getting ready for this but they're not going to be safe in australia
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.080]  or new zealand they're not going to be safe in europe they're not going to be
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:08.800]  safe in the cook islands they're not going to be safe on kawaii
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:11.520]  they're not and we've all identified everybody knows who they are
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.720]  and they will be brought to justice if they're able to launch this civil war
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:22.800]  know that they will be defeated and it's important to let them know that go ahead
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:25.920]  well first of all it wasn't a shot at you you're doing tremendously more than
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:29.520]  the rest of us just listening i love the products
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.680]  i'm a you know a listener for several years since uh well before the election
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:38.080]  i'm a trump supporter and if they take a shot at our president
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.200]  i don't think you would have to tell anyone to take action i think i know
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.920]  but sir what i'm saying is in god bless you i don't mean to get grumpy with you
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.480]  it's just this stuff's very frustrating so i'm sorry i miss read what you were
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:52.720]  saying what i'm getting in here is the what they'll do is they'll
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:56.480]  probably blow up a nursery school or a bunch of kids or a football game
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:00.480]  or shoot them up right at the same time they kill the president
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.680]  to have that overshadow the killing of the president to demonize his supporters
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:08.640]  so i understand you're not going to have to get directed where to go
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:13.040]  the point is they're going to do events to demonize you preemptively
[01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:17.280]  you understand this is a test just to maneuver us into the mind frame they
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.840]  want this is a hundred percent stage brother so i'm saying this is them
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.200]  taking the safety off they're cleared to fire they've got us in their cross
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:30.960]  areas right now you understand god bless you brother
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.520]  all right i'm going to come back and take more calls and once Gavin McGinnis
[01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:36.400]  gets on with us i'm going to play four or five minutes that rob is put together
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:39.760]  of all the eyewitnesses saying multiple shooters but you can get confused by
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:42.640]  a guy shooting from a building and it bounces off another building
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:48.720]  and then that's not what on some of you already know i am a voracious
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:53.360]  consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:56.400]  more research i came across the fact that the elite
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.720]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:04.000]  in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.280]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:11.360]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and so i

[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.240]  nothing can put the genie back in the bottle nothing can reconstruct

[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:51.440]  go back to your phone calls right now let's go ahead and go to chris in
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:53.680]  arizona chris thanks for holding her on the
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:56.720]  ear worldwide hey no problem alex hey i'm a
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.800]  longtime listener first-time caller i got a question for you yes sir
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:04.400]  curious to get your take on it okay so the police said that the cameras that
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:08.720]  were in steven paddock's hotel in the hotel yes we're not recording
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:12.320]  and do you think these cameras could have been transmitting a live feed to the
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:15.360]  accomplices and also how would he have been able
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:20.560]  to install these cameras when um what was it the mandalay bay
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:25.120]  well they have this surveillance systems that are equivalent to the pentagon
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:28.480]  and i'm just curious to get your take on that well that's why the sheriff
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:31.760]  you can't act it's not fake it's completely exhausted
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:35.680]  in these videos these press conferences and totally freaked out
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.200]  and when he talks about how they're looking at radicalization because of
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.560]  what they found he just shakes his head and then
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:47.520]  he says but we don't want the folks to know that we can be on their trail but
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:52.000]  obviously we're on the trails and then the new press conference last night he
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.640]  says yes a woman was there their receipts they've confirmed what we
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.640]  broke but drudge carry is accurate again boom boom boom over and over again
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.760]  i'm just saying that because they keep saying we're not credible because we are
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.680]  uh and then clearly they're saying he had wireless cameras outside
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:10.640]  he had two suites there were other people there uh these these hotels are
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:14.240]  like fort nox they're watching everything you do even if you're a vip
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.040]  guest they knew what he was doing and you look at the
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:20.720]  mo of the owners hooked in with care and the muslim brotherhood
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:24.880]  and building stuff over the middle east and hooked in with george soros's
[02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:29.040]  resistance movement that's in the news i mean this is literally a george soros
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.960]  combine where this happened so what do you think
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:36.880]  brother i mean look at who they targeted look at the time frame look at the
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:43.520]  promise of october first i mean it's staring us all in the face
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:47.760]  what do you think chris uh i i think that people that are awake are seeing
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.200]  through all this misinformation that they're putting out
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:55.120]  and i saw last night on fox that uh during that press conference they had
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:58.400]  that they were they were pretty upset about these conspiracy theories that
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.400]  people are reading online and they're really not doing anything
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:08.480]  to counter that by not releasing any information and i think it's ridiculous
[02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:12.640]  that something like this could happen and they would not give any details that
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.720]  just lends credence to these conspiracy theories that
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:22.160]  they're in no way trying to debunk and i'm just i'm just
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:28.000]  mad i'm sad for this country and i i really i pray that nothing
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.520]  like this happens again well brother unfortunately i'm sure it will
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:35.600]  that's about to say i mean they prime the pump it's completely obvious
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:38.640]  they're targeting on a sleep population for those of us that are awake
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.320]  it's it's as you know obvious as the nose of somebody's face that hillary
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:45.440]  you know rigged the debates and knew the questions we said that the night it
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:48.080]  happened and then it came out exactly what we said
[02:03:48.080 --> 02:03:52.320]  she had the questions three weeks before it says so see we see it
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:56.720]  we know it we you can see scripting well we can see the scripting here it's
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.080]  ridiculous and the thing is they've been told part of the investigation
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:03.920]  by all the obama holdovers and the fbi and the atf
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:07.520]  you know to shut this down the president has to release it
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:12.320]  i guarantee you folks it's anti-fummaterial that was in the hotel
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:15.920]  and traveling to the middle east i was told that by the hostage rescue team
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:18.960]  you think they'd risk their careers and lives to tell me that if they weren't
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:23.120]  upset my lies being put out that's real that's why everything we've said has
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:28.560]  been now confirmed because it's the truth god bless you christ
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:32.720]  i can't even believe how hardcore this is believe me i don't want this job
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.680]  this is not about a power trip or being the big guy that's right
[02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:39.280]  because believe me man i'm whistling past the graveyard i need your prayers
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:43.120]  american eat your prayers and those victims eat your prayers but get ready
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:46.720]  the next attacks in the wings i got chills up down my back
[02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:50.640]  it's coming it's coming it's going to be much worse they could attack hundreds
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:55.520]  of targets in one night it's helter skelter
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:57.920]  james madison the father of the bill of rights wrote
[02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:02.720]  where an excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected no
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:07.040]  man is safe in his opinions in his person in his faculties or in his
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:10.080]  possessions is there any question that we have an excess
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:13.680]  of power in washington the only question is how do we contain it
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:17.680]  and how do we remove that power from washington to our local communities
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.400]  to the individual that is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the
[02:05:22.400 --> 02:05:27.120]  excess of power was always the chief concern of the founders of this country
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.480]  that was why the anti-fetalists opposed the constitution they believe they put
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:34.160]  safeguards in the constitution to abuse that concentration of power but as
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:38.480]  james madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:42.160]  of people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the
[02:05:42.160 --> 02:05:44.800]  power that knowledge gives arm yourself with the
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:48.480]  information of what your rulers are doing of what the real constraints upon
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:51.440]  them are only then will you have the courage to
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:06:05.840]  nullify their actions friend for wars dot com i'm david night
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:12.640]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:19.920]  longing for the sun you will come to the island without me
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:29.840]  the longing for the sun to be welcomed on the island many miles away from home
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:37.360]  be welcomed on the island without me the longing for the sun
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:51.920]  you will come to the island many miles away from home
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.160]  gevin mcginnis is our guest and he's got a new really fancy
[02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:00.160]  non-blue screen studio if you're a radio listener
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:05.440]  you can go to info wars dot com forward slash show
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:08.160]  or watch on some of the tv stations we're on across the country
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:12.400]  and that's what gavin's doing now launching syndicated radio slash
[02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:17.280]  television and i'm so excited to have the competition
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:20.800]  on i was eating during the break a little bit down the wrong tube because
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:24.480]  i'm not in competition with anybody who wants freedom i'm in competition with
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:27.760]  tyranny and it's great to have gavin a founder of
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:31.040]  vice and so much more here with us gavin out of the gates what do you say
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:36.640]  about vegas what's your gut tell you uh i'm not a conspiracy guy i tend to be
[02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:39.680]  pretty cynical about these things but something
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:44.560]  something leaks here remember that church that got shot up that mosque sorry
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:48.240]  in cobec uh it was a guy there was two people there
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:51.040]  then there was one person there it was pretty clear that the government was
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:54.960]  trying to hide but even in that case we knew within seconds
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:59.200]  that this guy had once clicked a like on a facebook article
[02:07:59.200 --> 02:08:02.880]  about le pen that was just a click many years before
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:06.400]  so we're usually remarkably thorough and this
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:10.160]  this time we got nothing no facebook no twits
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:15.360]  tweets no no family relations i mean how do we know so little it doesn't make
[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:19.360]  sense absolutely in fact that's why i love getting
[02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.120]  you on that's the one point i hadn't made but i was thinking
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:27.280]  about that just the other day how crazy this is folks
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:30.560]  we always when it's a right winger or a libertarian
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.280]  we hear their entire facebook history their twitter history
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:36.800]  they've always visited info wars dot com because the site's
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:40.960]  you know 50 times bigger than msnbc dot com of course people are visiting it
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:45.760]  literally but but but still they always demonize matt drudge myself
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:49.360]  you would have heard this but now they're sitting on it and yeah but i can
[02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:53.760]  tell you why i got a call and it was confirmed later by text from the
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:57.920]  hostage rescue team that was there and they said indeed it was full of
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:02.480]  antifa and islamic paraphernalia wow
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:06.640]  yeah that the police feel like and i'm when i say the police i mean the top
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.840]  brass obviously not the guys on the street but the top brass in the
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:13.280]  government they're better than us they're smarter than us we can't control
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:16.800]  ourselves so what they'll do is they'll parse out information
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:20.080]  based on what we can handle because we can't handle the truth
[02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:24.080]  jack nicholson was right so they're just gonna dole it out little pieces
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.160]  to make sure we don't get too angry and we saw this in paris if you recall at
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:31.520]  the bataclan they said oh there was a shooting and we got the guys and it was
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:34.800]  very terrible it was a freak accident blah blah blah and you go
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:39.200]  then you find out a year later that they were eviscerating pregnant woman
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:42.720]  taking the babies out the dying babies they were cutting off men's
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:47.440]  genitalia and putting it in their mouths but the mayor hid that information
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:51.280]  from us because it's too intense and it might lead to a backlash against
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:54.320]  muslims so they just doled out little but if he would have been a
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:56.960]  conservative doing that of course a conservative wouldn't do that
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:02.240]  you would see video of the testicles i mean you have seen the whole thing
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.680]  this this has to be that they figure we can't handle the truth
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.520]  and it's funny how when it's someone who's right wing we hear about it all
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:11.760]  even when they're not necessarily right wing
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:15.040]  if some lunatic on on pharmaceuticals
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.520]  is in one picture holding a confederate flag then we have evidence of nazis and
[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:22.400]  white power and they just they're happy to unleash that
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:26.160]  let's get that up let's get people killed let's get nazis punched
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:29.760]  and make every conservative a nazi and get there all their lives in danger
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.720]  that's fine but if it's a liberal uh no i don't want i don't want to condone
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.560]  the nra's narrative so i'm not doing it
[02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:42.080]  gabin what do you make of jimmy kimmel and all of them out of the gates the
[02:10:42.080 --> 02:10:46.480]  talking point from chuckie schumer that we are all guilty collectively
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:50.480]  that we all did it that we're bad that we're involved in a dirty business to
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:53.120]  quote kimmel last night he said gun owners
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:57.360]  are involved in this dirty business this is next level
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:02.880]  leftist guilt tripping just crazy desperate attempt when this guy has
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:06.400]  been in all these videos improperly handling guns threatening to shoot me
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:11.120]  with a gun on tv once saying he's coming to kill me uh all
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:13.600]  the rest of it now he's pointing at me even though he has a bunch of body
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:16.480]  guards with guns on video but he's saying
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:19.920]  none of us can have guns and that we all are in a dirty business
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:24.480]  but he owns guns so i guess he's saying that he is guilty
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:27.680]  it's amateur hour we saw this with the nfl taking a knee
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:31.280]  you you and i have been doing this for decades when someone says that they want
[02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:34.800]  to take a knee to police brutality you say oh okay so how many deaths are
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:37.360]  in just a year what happened what are you talking about to me right so you're
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:39.840]  talking about mike browning talking about trevon marten which case are you
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:42.960]  talking about let's get into it and you realize oh no i don't i don't actually
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:45.600]  know what i'm talking about just like virtue signaling
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:49.440]  and jimmy kimmel crybaby kimmel i know him by the way he's not a political guy
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:53.680]  he's a sports guy he loves sports and he loves comedy he loves his family
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.640]  he sees someone die and he just goes for the the the go-to rich guy thing which
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.480]  is guns are bad trump is bad everyone's a nazi
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:06.960]  and it's it's just what amateurs do it's what babysitters do
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.960]  it's what little girls do and when someone isn't well versed in guns or
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:14.080]  these things they they they decide they want to play political for
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:16.960]  there they want our jobs for a day and there's so bad at
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:21.520]  hey jimmy what law would have prevented this tell me how to prevent these
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:26.640]  in his own diatribe he said this guy had a clean record he was mentally sound
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.640]  uh he gave away that no background check would have stopped this and let's
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.000]  expand on that it's about the butt it's about the modification
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:38.640]  let's make it all about that we've tried that it doesn't work
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:43.360]  expanding on that gavin we now have a coming out the sheriff's saying no he
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.120]  clearly was rattled glass he said he definitely
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:50.560]  did not do this alone these are quotes uh definitely
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:53.280]  uh they're investigating him for radicalization which means they found
[02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:56.800]  evidence to follow down that trail but we're hearing nothing i think it's
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:00.240]  absolutely essential uh that that information get out the media
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:03.200]  spinning it that we on the conservative side of the libertarian
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:08.160]  side are just making up things no we're going to what we have the target
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:12.080]  just like colonel schaefer uh you know of army and cia intelligence
[02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:16.560]  uh said the motive is the target and and it looks just like a replay of a guy
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:19.440]  the exact same age uh going and shooting congressman's
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:23.520]  colleagues who wanted to kill the other 14 congressman as well
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:28.000]  isn't that a strange word radicalize i mean he's they're gonna say all he
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.760]  stripped up and he meant if it's it's a radical thing to do
[02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:34.720]  not in the skateboard surfer way but it's a radical thing to do
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:39.600]  to shoot up people so that's what i meant no no one ever uses a word radicalized
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.480]  to mean right winger no one says timothy mcvay had become radicalized
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:49.440]  radicalized is reserved for islam so i think the sheriff's screwed up there
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.880]  and accidentally let that word slip which is going to let islam slip and
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:57.120]  and by the way i think we can stop differentiating between radical islam
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:02.160]  and the alt left those guys have merged limasar sure was my all day
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:05.920]  they're running the woman's march radical islam sharia law
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:09.280]  and the far left and communism they're all one big ball and they all
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:12.560]  have decided the enemy of my enemy is my friend and their enemy is us
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:16.400]  is the patriarch and then the hotel is connected to the
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:19.920]  care and the muslim brotherhood and building tassinos the middle east and
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:24.080]  and and doing donations to it telling their employees give george soros money
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.440]  you know give all the usual suspects money southern prairie law center
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:30.560]  who got caught running the white supremacist compound in oklahoma city
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:34.880]  i mean just all the usual suspects and five days he's up there with other
[02:14:34.880 --> 02:14:38.400]  people putting up cameras and 20 to two guns
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:42.320]  and thousands of rounds of ammo i mean everybody knows you go to a normal
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.400]  hotel they come in when you're gone and search stuff
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:48.400]  as a security deal at these casinos you're lucky if you don't get a
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:52.720]  proctology exam well the devil's in the details
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:55.520]  and there's so many tiny details here that don't add up
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.040]  who orders two pepsis have you ever ordered two by the way
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.480]  conservatives don't drink pepsi everybody knows that since the last
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:06.560]  election especially that's a democrat drink it is
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:11.280]  it is really really suspicious and i can handle the truth i wouldn't be
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:14.880]  remotely surprised if this guy had converted to islam
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:19.040]  i wouldn't be remotely surprised if this guy was a left-winger who thought

[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:06.160]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:11.280]  and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:15.120]  approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:20.880]  air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.680]  pathogens added to the food and water to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:30.640]  vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:34.080]  i personally counter this onslaught with anthroplex

[02:19:48.160 --> 02:19:51.920]  it's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at
[02:19:51.920 --> 02:19:56.160]  inforwarslife.com with anthroplex
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:03.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:14.160]  alex jones here back live gata beginis leaves us at the bottom of the hour i'm
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.320]  gonna come back and take your phone calls and play that compilation of videos
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:22.640]  clearly showing two shooters and i've interviewed the former
[02:20:22.640 --> 02:20:26.080]  head of ceo team six he doesn't like me saying that that's what he did
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:30.400]  dev group and a bunch of other people currently in special operations army
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:36.720]  highest levels most elite units who were assigned to hrt and i'm even
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:40.160]  authorized to say that they weren't in the raid they were behind it
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:44.960]  and the guy shot back at him he didn't commit suicide
[02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:49.760]  and there was islamic crud everywhere and anti-facrap all over
[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:53.760]  then i'd ask well was he set up i mean then i would investigate there i
[02:20:53.760 --> 02:20:56.960]  wouldn't just pin it on but the fact that they're covering that up
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:01.520]  hmm as gavin beginis said if it was a conservative we'd know his whole
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:05.280]  facebook history if he visited inforwars we'd know we always get to hear
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:08.000]  about it even if they were actually leftist that visited
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:11.440]  our sites so gavin you're absolutely on target
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:15.200]  may i say i really like your new studio that's very very
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.040]  very smart what are the other big issues
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:22.240]  i mean they're trying to frame us all for this they're moving forward
[02:21:22.240 --> 02:21:25.120]  they're trying to give us collective guilt you got the nfl thing they tried
[02:21:25.120 --> 02:21:27.680]  to frame trump saying that he didn't help
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:31.440]  Puerto Rico and we flooded him with mountains of help and then the
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:34.880]  mayor and others got caught with the teamsters blocking the goods i mean
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:39.360]  democrats have gone to such new nasty heights i can't even believe it but
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:42.080]  trump's approval ratings even in their skewed polls
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:48.320]  are skyrocketing what next level of lunacy will they go to to try to stop us
[02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:53.200]  you know it's they never cease to amaze me after charlotte's phil i went oh
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:56.560]  good i disavowed that i'm glad i had nothing to do with it and then they go
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:00.560]  yeah but you met someone who was there oh okay so now i'm guilty
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:05.920]  or this thing with the with the shooting in vegas you go okay finally
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:12.080]  gabin skype just uh froze up that's kind of cool while his skype froze up
[02:22:12.080 --> 02:22:16.720]  it's like i'm living here in the future because my tv's hd and our connection
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:23.120]  to him on skype uh is oh it's gone now was hd and it looked like he was in a
[02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:28.640]  picture window frozen right there this hd tv man you'll be i was at target
[02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:35.040]  a few weeks ago buying something i forget party favors for one of my kids but
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:37.520]  i don't go to target often but i do go to target even though it's a globalist
[02:22:37.520 --> 02:22:42.000]  communist combine and they have these new hd tv's and i'm not doing an ad for
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:47.680]  them and they were so hd that it was like i was looking out a window in spain or
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:51.040]  in italy and they were i was like trying to reach through the televisions
[02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:56.400]  it's just we are living in science fiction land that's all i'm saying and
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:59.760]  how does the establishment think that there wouldn't be any byproducts of all
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:04.880]  this new communication uh that the people would have a wider voice
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:08.320]  and the people could have choices of what they wanted to listen to
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:12.080]  and what they wanted to watch and then if that did happen that the public would
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:15.120]  break with them and know about of authoritarianism
[02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:18.480]  would help put that back in the bottle and we have catalonia trying to pull out
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:22.160]  and then they go beat up everybody so now they're going to succeed for sure
[02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:26.080]  again the force feeding the desperate establishment uh Gavin
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:29.760]  what point have we gotten to where the left is getting so insane
[02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:35.040]  and it's only driving people away from them faster
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:40.480]  it's a new studio for gavin so we're working out the bugs right now
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:42.960]  let me see if he can hear me up in new york from here
[02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:47.760]  gavin can you hear me over there in new york sitting
[02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:51.120]  i read you loud and clear good we're gonna have to hold you over the next
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:54.320]  segment so i got more questions for you but now that we've worked out the
[02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:58.240]  technical difficulties can you hear me out here from texas
[02:23:58.240 --> 02:24:01.760]  yes i can hear you up here in new york city you sound fine
[02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:04.800]  good what are they gonna do as everyone turns on them and is a
[02:24:04.800 --> 02:24:09.040]  problem-rating skyrocket nothing they're unflappable
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:12.640]  you know what i said earlier that they've merged with isis they've merged
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:16.480]  with the extremist jihadists and now the alt left and
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.000]  and the radical islam are as one they're also that way
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.600]  behaviorally they're that way ideologically and isis the islam is
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:29.520]  insatiable the woman puts on a burqa she's still getting lashes because part
[02:24:29.520 --> 02:24:33.360]  of her bangs are showing or you can see your socks they're never satisfied
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.120]  islam similarly the far left will never ever
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:40.400]  waver the more data they get the conflicts are believed the more steadfast
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:44.640]  they will become in those beliefs they they see country music fans get murdered
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.880]  because they've been dehumanized and they go that's your fault that's guns
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:53.520]  they they no matter what happens it's more evidence that trump is hitler
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:56.800]  so what do you do you do what you do with radical islam
[02:24:56.800 --> 02:25:00.080]  you cut them loose you say i'm not talking to you anymore
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:05.440]  you don't have a say you're not invited to my party get off my lawn
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:09.280]  and what does your maximum get off my lawn mean i mean i i get it in general
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:12.880]  but it's a great term i mean does it mean i have my territory i can have my
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.480]  own culture you can be what you want but i'm an individual
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:19.840]  yes it means i am here if you're here to enrich my life
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:23.360]  then by all means welcome aboard but if you're to mess if you're here to mess
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:26.320]  with me every year if you're here to sabotage the patriarchy or
[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.080]  capitalism or the west get lost get off my lawn
[02:25:30.080 --> 02:25:33.680]  and it i welt kowalski says it in uh grand terino
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:36.320]  and i just thought what a perfect example of how great
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:40.080]  america used to be where we used to be proud of our lawns where dads
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:44.000]  used to be the the boss now we've got homer sims or simpson with his hands
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.680]  stuck in a toaster going i want to get back to people
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:54.080]  revering the patriarch i've got to say uh i was once for a costume
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:56.880]  party i guess around halloween uh the guy from
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:25:59.920]  falling down but i think you're channeling you know somebody that would
[02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:03.920]  work at say ibm or texas instruments in 1984
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:08.000]  that is quite the outfit you're wearing in fact before you even kind of went
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.520]  with that i was trying to get uh oh and stroyer because he can pull it off i
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:14.960]  said i want the most right wing outlandish
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:18.960]  reptiles i want huge american flag lapels because it triggers them in
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:24.800]  but i said think think even like a fancy version of the guy from falling
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:28.240]  down and you've done it well i just rewatched that
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:32.240]  movie actually and he is an awesome character but i forgot how badly he
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:36.240]  treats his ex-wife he's a real jerk to her that's that's
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:39.680]  not what i'm going for but uh outside of that yeah i like
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:43.040]  this guy who's mad as hell i'm not gonna take it anymore
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:47.200]  because it's been decades of me sitting with liberals i live in new york city
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:50.880]  so i sit with them and i go okay tell me what what do they do when you wear that
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:53.520]  outfit because here's the deal everything they do so uncool
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:56.800]  so rejected i agree the coolest thing to be now
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:27:00.640]  is what you're wearing in fact i'm too fat to pull it off too big but
[02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:04.240]  that's i think everybody should start dressing just like that just to let folks
[02:27:04.240 --> 02:27:09.280]  know we reject your establishment garbage conservative is the new punk it's
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:13.600]  now radical to say i like traditionalism i think most women would be happier at
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:16.160]  home i think that they should follow the law
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:19.440]  when it comes to immigration now to have your dad's views
[02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:24.240]  which in a tavern 30 years ago were just mundane i mean you wouldn't even say
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:26.880]  that because it's so obvious yes i love america
[02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:30.400]  no i don't want it ruined with with different cultures diluting it
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:33.280]  but now when you say something that's just normal
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.920]  it's considered remarkably radical well my thing is america america has always
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:41.040]  been about a bunch of cultures together but they were coming to get away from
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:43.440]  oppression and trying to make something better
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:47.120]  now other groups are brought in to be turned against america by the globalist
[02:27:47.120 --> 02:27:51.360]  that's why it's a problem you know britain is a perfect example that that is
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:54.800]  the canary in the coal mine and you have what's his name said econ
[02:27:54.800 --> 02:27:58.240]  i was confusing with the the british editor at bright part but
[02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.480]  he said immigrants don't have to assimilate and he also said terrorism is
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.560]  just part of living in a big city so you combine those two and you have the
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:09.920]  opposite of what the west was all about it was
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:13.360]  i don't care who you are if you're here and you're on board with freedom
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:18.560]  let's do this and it's been working for centuries and all the sudden in the
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:21.520]  past i would even say five years we've said you know what
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:25.200]  let's just burn the whole thing to the ground and that's what i think happened
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.480]  in vegas i think a big part of that attack was this
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:31.120]  dehumanization you know charles kraut hammer says
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:34.960]  they think we're evil we just think they're wrong they think that we are like
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:38.640]  demons and they want to blast us and kill us oh
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:41.760]  they want to make them victims which they are and they used to get the guns
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:45.040]  but simultaneously all these liberals are celebrating their deaths let's come
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.360]  back and do five more minutes i want to ask you what happens
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:50.880]  if they assassinate president trump let's get serious with gavin again is
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:53.600]  then your phone calls

[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:50.960]  left alone to live my own life just like gavin has been a very successful
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:55.920]  comedian filmmaker writer found advice you know they got
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:00.160]  bought by hbo and as he said before he's been ostracized he's
[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:03.760]  been kicked out of his entire circle of
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:08.240]  friends like they're a cult i mean you hear about these cults where you don't
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:11.440]  agree with those they say sorry i can't talk to you anymore well
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:15.280]  that's what democrats are like and now
[02:34:15.280 --> 02:34:19.040]  areas downtown of austin which has been colonized by failures from california
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:21.360]  i don't mean all the california is bad you know the failures that went to
[02:34:21.360 --> 02:34:26.320]  california and failed they're like moths or or locust
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:29.360]  they've now come here and they'll run up and scream and cuss at me and throw
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:32.640]  things at me people seen live feeds where i'm just
[02:34:32.640 --> 02:34:35.840]  walking down the street people are driving by going after you after you
[02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:39.680]  now for every person that does that five or six way that me want to shake my
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:43.440]  hand of every color of every creed of every male female gay straight you name
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:47.360]  it but they're just so intolerant and cancelling
[02:34:47.360 --> 02:34:49.920]  burke burkely that he was going to speak at but then
[02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:53.600]  anti-fucking march the next day uh and now ellen dirsh which is going to sue
[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:56.560]  him was they won't let him speak and and just the evil of these people and
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:59.520]  they're ratcheting up the rhetoric saying we're going to kill trump we're
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:02.720]  going to kill his family we're going to kill his supporters and i've had him dump
[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:06.320]  hot coffee on me and you scream nazi while they do it
[02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:10.400]  they want a coming of age war and so what happens
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:13.680]  if they kill president trump they're foiling plots reportedly
[02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:16.880]  every few days right now that you really don't hear about some of them come out
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:20.080]  but i've got secret service sources i mean it is insane
[02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:23.040]  they're having to spend three times what they did on obama because it's just
[02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:26.240]  coming out of the woodwork and the president's not a coward he's out there
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:29.840]  but what happens gavin mcginnis syndicated tv host
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:35.280]  what happens on crtv doing great stuff what happens
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:39.840]  if the president is killed because i'm really concerned that the deep state who
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:42.480]  says they want an upheaval they want a revolution
[02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:46.880]  to stop the populace peaceful awakening to derail
[02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:51.120]  this this political realignment that that it's in the calculus
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.160]  and they've had former deputy director of the cia say we're going to kill the
[02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:58.720]  president on cnn that's a clear threat they're clearly trying to line that up
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:03.680]  right now what happens if they kill 45
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:08.240]  first of all isn't it amazing how mainstream that question has become
[02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:12.240]  it's on cnn all the time it comes up on mainstream media
[02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:16.800]  all the time like it's a perfectly normal thing meanwhile back in obama's days
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:20.320]  we have one road rodeo clown dares to dress up like him
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:24.560]  the guys fired you never mock the president don't you dare make fun of him
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:29.200]  yet we can discuss trump's murder it's just it's just accepted in fact on
[02:36:29.200 --> 02:36:33.120]  november 4th there's a massive riot plan by antifa
[02:36:33.120 --> 02:36:37.040]  where they want to shut down the entire country burn it to the ground and part
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:40.240]  of that is to either have trump leave or be killed
[02:36:40.240 --> 02:36:44.560]  and they don't seem to understand that pence is more republican and right-wing
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.440]  than trump is so that you'd have to kill trump
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:51.120]  and the vice president and if you even try to do that
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:56.480]  you are going to wake the sleeping giant america is pretty annoyed with the left
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:36:59.600]  but they're busy people you know even those country fans
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:03.760]  at the jason l dean concert only 60 percent are political people who
[02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.680]  consider themselves right-wing only 11 percent are liberal 30 percent are just
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:10.160]  not political but if you start messing with a
[02:37:10.160 --> 02:37:14.320]  democratically elected president you are going to
[02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:18.000]  you're going to regret it is what's going to happen and america is going to
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:21.920]  calm down on the left hard
[02:37:21.920 --> 02:37:25.040]  well that's what they're trying to package and just like hillary thought
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:27.520]  she was invincible and all these other guys thought they were
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:31.040]  but they keep getting their butts handed to them don't they understand that it's
[02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:34.240]  two plus two equals four that they're playing chess here
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:37.360]  that they'll be aftermath because so many of their decisions
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:40.560]  they just make like they're a three-year-old uh sticking their hand in
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:44.480]  the cookie jar or peeing in the pool they don't think about what's going to
[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:48.720]  come as a repercussion that to me is most frightening of all
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:52.640]  it's it's almost like there's a pop star you don't like like katie perry
[02:37:52.640 --> 02:37:55.920]  and you go i don't want her around and then you just ruin her career
[02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:00.320]  and then she'll be gone trump isn't just trump trump is an idea
[02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:03.760]  and that idea is let's be proud of america again
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:07.280]  let's accept the fact that we are the best country in the world
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:11.440]  and voters went yep i'm all for trying that i tried we suck
[02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:15.200]  for eight years it didn't go well so if you think you can kill trump
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:20.000]  you also think you can kill that idea the idea that america kicks ass and
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:23.760]  america will kick your ass if you try that well that's what i've already
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:26.960]  the ones that are good with guns not them that's what they've already tried is
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:30.080]  saying the nr is terrorist and then the next night
[02:38:30.080 --> 02:38:33.680]  gun owners are terrorists you're in dirty business you're bad
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:37.920]  people are rejecting it so kemo and his speech writers don't get
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:41.040]  don't they understand like you can press somebody that's asleep
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:45.280]  or press somebody you got whipped what they're doing to us is not whipping us
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:49.200]  it's enraging us no one i know is buying this
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:51.520]  and well that's why trump was elected by the way
[02:38:51.520 --> 02:38:55.680]  the it was for 25 years us dads have been sitting on the couch
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:38:59.040]  and when the polling station calls we go i'm busy and when it's time for the
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:01.520]  election we go man it's all fixed anyway screw it
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.040]  and then this election came along and we saw trump and for the first time in
[02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:08.240]  25 years dads put down their beer they said hold my beer
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:11.360]  and they walked to the polling station and conversely

[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:16.080]  it's like that drunk guy at the party who just ruins every conversation and then
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:19.120]  he knocks something over and then he's trying to change this song and he just
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:22.080]  goes and scrapes the record that's what the left
[02:40:22.080 --> 02:40:25.600]  is they go and they ruin video games they ruin movies

[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:48.000]  that you don't want to ruin like what's they've ruined jokes they've ruined sex
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:53.840]  they've ruined dating what's left and then they love authoritarian islam
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.360]  and want to ally with that but then they think men you know in the house wearing
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:40:59.920]  pants is bad but throw an asshole on women's faces
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.280]  so much so they're trying to ban precursors to acid and having acid
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:06.160]  control in london because they're having seven attacks a day
[02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.760]  melting women's faces off i'm sorry to laugh but it's just they've
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:16.000]  chosen this most bizarre bedfellows they're calling us racist sexist
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.480]  homophobes and embracing jihadists who throw gays
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:24.240]  off buildings treat women as second-class citizens and racism i mean
[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:26.800]  that's not even a thing to them at such a given
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:29.600]  that they are superior more superior than anyone else
[02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:33.520]  that racism is just that's an obvious one so i mean i think they abolished

[02:52:00.160 --> 02:52:04.880]  thanks for holding hello alex hi hey you rock
[02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:09.760]  okay i got three quick questions for you one this man was supposed to have a
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:13.120]  plane correct why didn't he fill that up and go
[02:52:13.120 --> 02:52:16.080]  shoot somebody you know like go in and kill everybody with that because that
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:19.920]  would have been a lot more if he was a lone wolf type person
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:23.520]  you know that would have done a lot more damage than the supposedly the guns at
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:27.040]  that distance what do you think of that the whole
[02:52:27.040 --> 02:52:30.720]  thing is perfect to be covered up and i don't know how you get 20 plus guns and
[02:52:30.720 --> 02:52:34.320]  thousands of rounds of ammo into a deal for five days and they don't learn
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:38.080]  about it uh where if i've talked to folks you
[02:52:38.080 --> 02:52:41.360]  leave a marijuana cigarette in your bag they find it hotel security comes the
[02:52:41.360 --> 02:52:45.440]  hotels all search your stuff folks and they do it even more at the casinos this
[02:52:45.440 --> 02:52:49.040]  is pure bull again one of my security people
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:52.800]  years ago was pulling security in vegas he even had the special license
[02:52:52.800 --> 02:52:56.320]  via the barcode and uh and serial number you're supposed to have with
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:59.440]  whatever company you're with very strict gun laws in the city
[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:03.120]  and in the county uh there where vegas is located not so much in the state
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:06.400]  itself they went in he went down for an an hour to
[02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:10.000]  eat something came back up his gun was gone out of the underwear drawer
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:13.360]  uh they he called him they said please come down to the
[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:16.960]  downstairs area he was there three hours they were going to take him to jail
[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:22.800]  till the security company brought uh his his security license to be an arm you
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:28.320]  know security personnel with the code so so they search
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:32.880]  your room when you leave it's a fact it is a setup the company is involved with
[02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:36.000]  jihadis i'm not saying they did the whole thing but they clearly had
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.480]  sympathizers and that's why you hear the cops
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:42.240]  using the word radicalized which is code for islam go ahead
[02:53:42.240 --> 02:53:45.360]  okay the other thing too that i'm just interesting here
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:48.960]  the woman okay he gets her a cheap ticket now this guy
[02:53:48.960 --> 02:53:52.320]  owns you know he's giving her a hundred thousand dollars now why would he
[02:53:52.320 --> 02:53:56.000]  keep the millionaire why would he buy her a cheap ticket and the other thing is
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:59.120]  why you know what kind of clothing did she take with her
[02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:05.440]  you know how many suitcases went with this woman well all i know is
[02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:09.440]  she had two different husbands this whole thing it's gun running it's drugs
[02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:12.320]  i mean you can just see it he was spending millions a year they were
[02:54:12.320 --> 02:54:15.280]  going oh he's winning at the casinos no one
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:18.160]  wins unless they bring a hundred thousand in the front
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:21.920]  and then leave with sixty thousand or seventy thousand that's the only way you
[02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:25.760]  win is laundering money and it's well known thank you so much for the call
[02:54:25.760 --> 02:54:29.760]  caring great point uh let's go ahead and talk
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:34.160]  to jesse in canada you're on the air jesse thanks for holding
[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:38.640]  hey every minute was worth alec i actually have one big question i have here
[02:54:38.640 --> 02:54:45.360]  is uh you know was it so if he went and and he bought all of these guns
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:50.640]  and all this ammunition in in what like the five days he was there
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:53.920]  and he has no prehistory of that or the fact that he was
[02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:56.960]  stock well now they're saying he bought the guns years ago but there's no
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:00.720]  record of most of that too the whole thing is just ridiculous i'm talking
[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:05.520]  about so like i could go to tim for like tim horton's up here for like a
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:08.640]  couple of months straight and i go to starbucks
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:11.840]  and i get a call because they think someone's using my credit card
[02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:15.600]  but this guy all of a sudden decides to go and start buying
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:21.120]  like arsenal the ar-15s and thousands around that's right that's right i buy
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:24.320]  probably 10 guns a year but they know who i am they know i'm a
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:26.800]  collector but i also have some of the guns here for
[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:30.320]  security personnel uh and i just i'm a collector so i've
[02:55:30.320 --> 02:55:34.000]  never been red flag but anybody that goes in and just out of the blue starts
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:38.240]  buying 20 30 guns in a year you get a visit
[02:55:38.240 --> 02:55:42.880]  yeah exactly and the other interesting thing i was thinking about is
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:46.480]  uh what kind of what would they say what the make of the vehicle was
[02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:50.000]  that he came into because there's no way he's got all of that
[02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:55.520]  loaded into like a basic sir normal hotels
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:00.960]  normal hotels rifle through your stuff i'll have prescription pills on me that
[02:56:00.960 --> 02:56:04.560]  that aren't even a controlled substance and then they'll fumble around and
[02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:08.560]  mess with those and open those up i mean they dig through everything it
[02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:13.600]  it's totally ridiculous it's a total setup
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:16.880]  i mean a lot of these rifles he had you can't even break down and and put in
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:20.800]  small bags it's it's pure bull he was in there for five days
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:26.720]  with 22 guns with two rooms transferring the food to another
[02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:30.080]  room so they wouldn't get suspicious you don't think they don't pay attention
[02:56:30.080 --> 02:56:32.560]  that you're eating one room and going to another
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:36.480]  oh my gosh nobody spies on you like hotels folks
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:39.440]  and they do it so people can't get in and run scams i mean i think it's a
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.280]  police state i don't like it but ladies and gentlemen
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:48.800]  vegas searches your room they profile you when they leave
[02:56:48.800 --> 02:56:53.200]  they're hooked into homeland security data threat analysis
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:56.960]  hotels major hotel chains are threat fusion centers
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:02.960]  okay that's a big secret it's not a public knowledge it's not classified but
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:07.680]  hotels are considered major nodes as our car rental facilities
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:11.360]  and things like that in the threat fusion center system
[02:57:11.360 --> 02:57:14.720]  and so they are threat fusion centers this guy attacked a crowd
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:18.640]  from a threat fusion center what do you say to that
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:22.240]  oh man like it's it's it's just the most ridiculous thing
[02:57:22.240 --> 02:57:26.720]  how tactically set up this was like that 400 yards you've got that
[02:57:26.720 --> 02:57:31.120]  32nd story uh height of that kid of the killer zone that
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:35.360]  that was set up you don't just come up with that you know exactly he had
[02:57:35.360 --> 02:57:38.880]  cameras out in the hallway i mean it and then the people that knew this guy
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:42.880]  said he was a mentally ill basket case he was a cut out he was a patsy he was a
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:46.000]  lee harvey oswald as most of you already know i am a
[02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:50.480]  voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or five
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:54.480]  years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:57.440]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:02.000]  ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:05.280]  and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:08.720]  of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:12.400]  and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have

[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:16.400]  josh and others lexy no problem um hi how are you
[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:22.720]  i'm good good um okay so i have kind of a theory or
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:26.800]  i guess a question um of is this legit
[03:01:26.800 --> 03:01:30.480]  thinking but everyone's looking into mary lou and her
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:34.480]  past this and that and what about the brother what about all the other
[03:01:34.480 --> 03:01:37.760]  brothers about the brother yes and i'm like dude
[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:42.640]  they so could have done this together and oh that brother is so suspicious i've
[03:01:42.640 --> 03:01:47.760]  never seen someone so disingenuous he just screams
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:53.920]  weasel absolutely and he would he would be the crazier one to go
[03:01:53.920 --> 03:01:57.360]  through it maybe even talk even into it and then
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:01.440]  before he leaves he cuts those cameras pops one in his brother
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:05.920]  and leaves and now he's on well i don't want to i don't want to say that with
[03:02:05.920 --> 03:02:09.760]  any evidence but obviously the he's got four other brothers
[03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:13.440]  family they're all intertwined if all the stuff we're hearing about the gun
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:16.640]  room secret and all this other stuff in the airplanes and now he gave them all
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:19.920]  money clearly they're all accomplished suspects
[03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:24.400]  i'm not saying they're accomplices but yeah the the the fbi the police everybody
[03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:28.000]  should be basically in their business they should already all been rated
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:32.000]  they should all be searched every i agree
[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.680]  focusing on the woman i think is a diversion
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:40.000]  yeah and his the brother the uh eric i think is his name
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:45.520]  he uh he's just he would have time to get on a plane because it's right there
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:48.880]  by the airport get back to orlando before the
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:52.640]  morning where where are his records of well there's other brothers
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:55.920]  there's other brothers here's the deal we don't know that
[03:02:55.920 --> 03:03:00.880]  okay i'm just saying the guy squirrely maybe he just
[03:03:00.880 --> 03:03:06.400]  is super quirky but i hear you lexie anything else
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:15.440]  lexie any any other points oh i didn't know if you were still there um
[03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:19.280]  no that's really it i just think you know his brother
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:23.760]  there's more going on with him than we're getting knowledge of that is
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:27.360]  certainly a fact uh lexie thank you you're a hundred percent right
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:32.640]  i mean the police say guaranteed he had help well what's the exact quote here
[03:03:32.640 --> 03:03:35.760]  um
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:41.760]  did not act alone says there's no way he that he acted alone and that they're
[03:03:41.760 --> 03:03:48.480]  looking into radicalization bingo let's go to

[03:04:19.120 --> 03:04:25.120]  no more fake news dot com proprietor john rapaport and remember john rapaport
[03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:28.640]  had that site 15 years ago so we got the whole fake news war is going on right
[03:04:28.640 --> 03:04:31.200]  now well he originally said no more fake news
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:35.520]  and so the father of exposing fake news will be uh taking over
[03:04:35.520 --> 03:04:38.320]  by the way he's been emailing me we've been talking i've been too busy to back
[03:04:38.320 --> 03:04:41.840]  with him i need to he's can also start doing reporting for us in the field
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:45.600]  uh on the east coast in the south so that's going to be happening so yes to
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:53.680]  your plan john we need to get that going so so much more straight ahead
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:58.880]  joe biggs here with info wars dot com with some patriotic quotes by ron paul
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:03.440]  the most basic principle to being a free american is the notion that we as
[03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:08.560]  individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions we do not have the
[03:05:08.560 --> 03:05:12.000]  right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes
[03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:15.440]  neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live
[03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:20.160]  so long as we aren't infringing on their rights freedom to make bad decisions
[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:24.320]  is inherent in the freedom to make good ones if we are only free to make good
[03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:29.200]  decisions then we are not really free liberty is lost through complacency
[03:05:29.200 --> 03:05:34.160]  and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints
[03:05:34.160 --> 03:05:39.600]  random searches mandatory identification cars and paramilitary police in our
[03:05:39.600 --> 03:05:43.360]  streets we have lost a vital part of our american heritage
[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:48.000]  america was born of protests revolution and mistrust of government
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:54.160]  subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long
[03:06:00.640 --> 03:06:03.680]  this message is transmitted at the request with the president of the
[03:06:03.680 --> 03:06:06.480]  united states of america and the office of homeland
[03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:09.360]  security in compliance with the united nations the
[03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:12.720]  president of the united states has declared martial law
[03:06:12.720 --> 03:06:15.920]  curfew is now in place return to your homes
[03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:20.000]  any congregating of two or more people outside of your homes will result in
[03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:24.400]  you being arrested on site if you are receiving this
[03:06:24.400 --> 03:06:29.040]  transmission you are the resistance it's the alex
[03:06:29.040 --> 03:06:33.200]  jones show you know it's really sad that so
[03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:36.240]  much of the information we pop to arise
[03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:40.480]  globalism deep state martial law new world order vaccine death
[03:06:40.480 --> 03:06:44.000]  lack of squads false flag is now just common
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:49.600]  vernacular but i did all this knowing that historically
[03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:53.200]  if somebody got to jump on the global estate failed
[03:06:53.200 --> 03:06:57.040]  and then if people said wait you have an unelected planetary world government
[03:06:57.040 --> 03:07:02.720]  run by people that are anti-prosperity who use medical tyranny to control us
[03:07:02.720 --> 03:07:06.800]  why would we go along with this once you expose that globalism's real and the
[03:07:06.800 --> 03:07:10.640]  imf and world banker real and the tpp's real and congress can't see the secret
[03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:14.240]  agreements people are going to say no way
[03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:16.640]  people said oh look they're beating everybody up in catalonia alex you said
[03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:20.320]  they were going to break away look now they're even breaking away more it was
[03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:24.880]  like 80% wanted to break away now it's 95% and the taxes aren't getting paid
[03:07:24.880 --> 03:07:27.840]  and the cops are all getting thrown out of the hotels and catalonia is going to
[03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:31.440]  break even harder with spain now just like briggs it they pass it now they're
[03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:34.880]  trying to fight it it'll be even stronger now
[03:07:34.880 --> 03:07:37.440]  my parents were just in england and scotland for two and a half weeks
[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:41.280]  they were mobbed by listeners
[03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:45.680]  people in france last time they would ever say jones jones you know jones
[03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:49.520]  like alex jones they all were his parents oh that's it i'm driving you
[03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:52.800]  around for three days for free while you're here wouldn't take money same
[03:07:52.800 --> 03:07:56.160]  thing happened to him in greece same thing happened to him in in england
[03:07:56.160 --> 03:08:00.480]  and i'm not bragging about me folks but nigel farage said last time he was on
[03:08:00.480 --> 03:08:05.440]  that half the people that joined u-kip the last decade were from my show and
[03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:08.960]  that's just because we were the only thing that was actually covering u k news
[03:08:08.960 --> 03:08:12.960]  and telling them about the e u and broadcasting anybody could have done it
[03:08:12.960 --> 03:08:16.400]  i was just one of the first to do it in electronic mass media
[03:08:16.400 --> 03:08:22.640]  effectively i drool over all these new good looking studios and really smart
[03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:27.520]  talk show hosts that get it i want to be obsolete believe me i don't want to be
[03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:30.880]  the one that gets the hostage rescue team called that they were inside the room
[03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:34.480]  with the islamic stuff and all the rest of it
[03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:38.400]  and have it all come out and be true you think it's fun to be that right
[03:08:38.400 --> 03:08:42.240]  you think it's fun to have them and i'm not complaining
[03:08:42.240 --> 03:08:46.320]  i'm just letting you know this is real and we're
[03:08:46.320 --> 03:08:50.720]  winning we're winning people like john rapaport
[03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:54.080]  25 years ago he was already out there fighting the globalists before i even
[03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:56.800]  got on air and i didn't know he'd been on air five years
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:00.720]  by the time i discovered him like in 1996 doing tv interviews with you know
[03:09:00.720 --> 03:09:04.160]  with people like david ike you name it he worked at you know for major networks
[03:09:04.160 --> 03:09:09.120]  newspapers he was aware from the inside he went and exposed it
[03:09:09.120 --> 03:09:12.560]  and so that's what's so exciting this is our time now
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:16.480]  to come together and realize the truth and all the panicking and all the
[03:09:16.480 --> 03:09:19.680]  pushing and all the freaking out is being done by the globalists because
[03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:22.720]  they're weak john's taken over here in just one moment
[03:09:22.720 --> 03:09:27.760]  i promised to finish up with ian but we had a caller a lady that just called
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:32.000]  from texas from austin and she was saying why aren't they looking at the rest
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:36.640]  of his family and his four brothers who act i mean the one brother acts
[03:09:36.640 --> 03:09:41.760]  completely disingenuous and classically weasel like
[03:09:41.760 --> 03:09:45.360]  he's beyond snake like it's a snake tries to be low cover and kind of calm
[03:09:45.360 --> 03:09:48.240]  and this guy's like
[03:09:48.240 --> 03:09:52.640]  pennywise or something you know oh you'll float come down here there's
[03:09:52.640 --> 03:09:57.360]  there's clowns and balloons and there's horses and lions and tigers and bears
[03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:01.520]  oh my and there's elephants too you're gonna like it just get closer
[03:10:01.520 --> 03:10:05.120]  and i'm not saying he's a bad guy but he everybody looks at him changing his
[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:08.560]  stories flip-flopping here it is they're wanting to
[03:10:08.560 --> 03:10:12.240]  take him into custody right now this is just breaking vegas shooter steven
[03:10:12.240 --> 03:10:14.880]  paddock's younger brother is wanted by cops
[03:10:14.880 --> 03:10:18.640]  oh he's got warrants out for all this other stuff
[03:10:18.640 --> 03:10:22.160]  little petty stuff like speed and tickets and all this but now they
[03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:29.200]  suddenly wanting uh think so he's incarnate weasel
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:36.640]  he's half weasel half fox half fruit bat
[03:10:36.640 --> 03:10:39.680]  yes i know you can't be three halves that's a joke folks
[03:10:39.680 --> 03:10:42.800]  they actually have pieces where they think when i make the man bear pick joke
[03:10:42.800 --> 03:10:46.240]  they go jones really believes that things can have three halves
[03:10:46.240 --> 03:10:50.400]  no it's called satire but they've actually had pieces on that on the young
[03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:54.080]  turks saying i don't know that see praying on their audience
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:57.280]  so they can feel official and powerful but let's go to ean and arizona thanks
[03:10:57.280 --> 03:11:00.560]  for holding go ahead and make your point sir
[03:11:00.560 --> 03:11:03.840]  yes sir i just want to say again thanks outlets for everything you do long-time
[03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:07.520]  listener i am an african-american Trump supporter and i appreciate that we
[03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:11.040]  have to channel the watch man because with all the fake news going on it's
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:14.000]  you know it's hard to get through the lies but anyways the point i wanted to
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.480]  get past was first quick point jimmy kimmel
[03:11:16.480 --> 03:11:20.240]  i think it's pretty ironic with all the propaganda he's pushing that
[03:11:20.240 --> 03:11:24.400]  his actual and i think a lot of people know that his actual recording studio
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:27.600]  is an old masonic building and i'm not trying to demonize all masons
[03:11:27.600 --> 03:11:30.800]  but we do know that there are secret societies so i just think it's kind of
[03:11:30.800 --> 03:11:33.120]  funny that you know he records all these
[03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:37.120]  videos and on stage all his propaganda outside of an old masonic building
[03:11:37.120 --> 03:11:40.560]  absolutely well he plays dumb when i know people that know him
[03:11:40.560 --> 03:11:44.960]  he's been into guns he reportedly told people he liked to me like five years
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:47.920]  ago uh i mean i know people used to co-host the man's
[03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:51.200]  show with him and stuff he is a political whore now
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:54.560]  trying to take my rights and your rights and that's why i'm going after him
[03:11:54.560 --> 03:11:58.560]  how dare him say we're involved in dirty business as gun owners when he's got
[03:11:58.560 --> 03:12:01.760]  private security and owns guns he's a hypocrite to boot
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:05.280]  he could have his views if he didn't have all those guns and bodyguards you get
[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:08.800]  where i'm saying yes sir yes sir i do
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:12.080]  other thing i want to say was uh two two more points the other thing the other
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:15.680]  caller said something about steve patinik i like him he says some good
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:19.200]  stuff tactically sometimes but i was wondering the same thing if
[03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:23.280]  maybe he was still kind of connected a little more to the cia and we might
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:26.400]  like i mean i know that you have connections with the cia like not like
[03:12:26.400 --> 03:12:29.360]  that but people that you talk to that you can get information from you've got
[03:12:29.360 --> 03:12:33.120]  connections from everywhere that's what you do you're a journalist you're a
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:38.240]  uh let's be clear let's be clear the cia is a giant sprawling
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:41.840]  secret government it's the biggest part of it's been around since 47 parts of it
[03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:44.320]  before that it's a whole bunch of different factions
[03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:48.400]  some would say seven different factions whatever so of course patinik
[03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:52.080]  not never get out of at that level he's a run major operations
[03:12:52.080 --> 03:12:55.120]  and i never know what weirdness he's involved in he's a really smart guy he's
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:12:58.720]  done a lot of good stuff uh but also i've seen the videos
[03:12:58.720 --> 03:13:02.160]  it's ridiculous to say those people weren't actually shot and you gotta ask
[03:13:02.160 --> 03:13:05.520]  what's going on and i have seen him flip flop and you know do some things
[03:13:05.520 --> 03:13:09.040]  lately about the generals taking over and how it's bad and how they've gone too
[03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:12.560]  far and then a week later he admonishes me and saying there's no problem and i
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:15.840]  think a lot of it is people you know have folks
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:19.760]  grabbing by short hairs and let let him know his boss me i'm a kamikaze i don't
[03:13:19.760 --> 03:13:22.720]  care what the threats come through what goes on people never even hear about it
[03:13:22.720 --> 03:13:25.840]  i just say do whatever you're gonna do i'm not stopping so
[03:13:25.840 --> 03:13:28.880]  we'll just see who's the bigger man at the end of the day and i'm not saying he
[03:13:28.880 --> 03:13:32.240]  sold out or anything i just know he's smart and knows that that's not
[03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:35.840]  accurate but i don't want to get off into him maybe i'll have him on in a few days
[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:39.840]  about he'll just blow up and you know have something i i mean look he's entitled
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:44.400]  to his opinion i have mine uh anything else seeing
[03:13:44.400 --> 03:13:48.720]  oh yeah the last thing i want to say was that uh i also believe that we really
[03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:51.680]  need to and i say this because how far we're going
[03:13:51.680 --> 03:13:55.760]  and uh i mean i still love that you do news every day i watch you every day i
[03:13:55.760 --> 03:13:58.880]  started off watching your documentaries but i really do think we need to look
[03:13:58.880 --> 03:14:03.280]  back at some of the things that people have put out like the checks marz and
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:06.880]  even the william cooper's i know you guys had your beat back in the days but
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:11.120]  i feel like you got we have to look back at the time of what i totally agree i
[03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:14.720]  need in fact i already told rob do you know he told me and i was already
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:19.040]  thinking at the same day we need to get back to all the basics cover each area
[03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:23.120]  vaccines electromagnetic radiation uh the occult the different power
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:26.480]  structures i totally agree thank you so much we're gonna go to break
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:29.200]  and i'm gonna come back and hand the baton to no more fake news
[03:14:29.200 --> 03:14:33.920]  dot com proprietor uh and we are going to uh you'll let him get to all the news
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:37.200]  he's got to cover but just listen briefly
[03:14:37.200 --> 03:14:41.680]  take what you're bringing up there just about um
[03:14:41.680 --> 03:14:45.840]  something like william cooper i had no beef with william cooper
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:50.880]  i understood how talk radio worked he was a shortwave guy i was also in shortwave
[03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:54.880]  but also am an anthem stations and so he started fights with me and
[03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:58.080]  criticized me and talked bad about me i guess because he thought i was
[03:14:58.080 --> 03:15:01.600]  competition and i thought it was funny because
[03:15:01.600 --> 03:15:05.040]  i knew that other talk show hosts would start fights with the other one
[03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:08.080]  but if you didn't respond you would just get their audience
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:12.000]  so see cooper didn't have other talk show hosts on

[03:22:33.280 --> 03:22:41.920]  bagus steven paddock the path see is that right you see the path see
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:50.160]  23 weapons they say found in his hotel suite at the mandalay 23 weapons
[03:22:50.160 --> 03:22:54.880]  okay now this is not just some guy
[03:22:54.880 --> 03:23:00.160]  who happened to wander into a casino once in a while he was very well known
[03:23:00.160 --> 03:23:06.880]  high-stakes gambler you bet the hotels know people like that they understand
[03:23:06.880 --> 03:23:13.760]  so you're telling me that he's lugging suitcase after suitcase
[03:23:13.760 --> 03:23:22.560]  of steel heavy weight up to his suite and nobody is taking notice
[03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:27.040]  they're saying well maybe it's all cash you know maybe he's bringing in
[03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:30.800]  50 million dollars and he needs a lot of suitcase
[03:23:30.800 --> 03:23:39.280]  so let's make sure we calm him this from the city where in any big casino
[03:23:39.280 --> 03:23:45.200]  a pit boss down on the floor or an eye in the sky can look down
[03:23:45.200 --> 03:23:50.720]  at a blackjack tape table and spot a card counter
[03:23:50.720 --> 03:23:55.360]  that's not somebody doing sleight of hand that's somebody doing mental tricks
[03:23:55.360 --> 03:24:02.880]  in his skull using formula algorithms based on the cards that have been
[03:24:02.880 --> 03:24:07.120]  played to know which best to place and they
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:11.040]  can spot a card counter and they can throw them out of the casino
[03:24:11.040 --> 03:24:17.840]  but you see in the case of steven paddock they just couldn't notice this guy
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:22.560]  coming in and out with suitcases that were quite heavy
[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:27.760]  just couldn't do it nobody could figure that out nobody noticed it
[03:24:27.760 --> 03:24:34.080]  and on top of that of course he would never need all these weapons
[03:24:34.080 --> 03:24:40.720]  for anything he just brought them up there for show or for
[03:24:40.720 --> 03:24:46.960]  for what reason we don't know including what was it 12 rifles
[03:24:46.960 --> 03:24:54.560]  most of them modified i mean come on come on and he's planning this
[03:24:54.560 --> 03:25:00.560]  operation for we're told for at least months
[03:25:00.560 --> 03:25:08.080]  leading a secret life for years so here's a guy who it turns out
[03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:13.520]  is not just as his brother said he's just a guy that likes burritos
[03:25:13.520 --> 03:25:17.280]  and he lives near vegas no he's a real estate
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:23.120]  investor millionaire can do anything he wants in the world
[03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:28.080]  but he decides that he's going to plan a long-term operation to kill
[03:25:28.080 --> 03:25:30.960]  unknown numbers of people large numbers of people
[03:25:30.960 --> 03:25:35.760]  that is going to result certainly in his own death
[03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:39.440]  so this is a long-term plan by suicide i'm just
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:45.600]  giving you the unbelievable things that we're supposed to be accepting here
[03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:51.440]  the official story is unbelievable and again vegas searches everybody's bags
[03:25:51.440 --> 03:25:53.920]  once you go in your room and you leave for the first time
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:25:58.640]  it's a not publicized fact but it's done most other hotels do it too
[03:25:58.640 --> 03:26:02.560]  five days why are they lying about him being there five days not three
[03:26:02.560 --> 03:26:06.800]  that's now confirmed we broke that with the receipts i mean this whole thing
[03:26:06.800 --> 03:26:10.720]  i know you always just lay out the facts here john but it's too riveting
[03:26:10.720 --> 03:26:14.240]  you're right the official is unbelievable then the hotel's owned by jihadi
[03:26:14.240 --> 03:26:17.840]  connected groups that give money to soros it goes on and on it gets
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:20.720]  crazier there's a threat fusion center next door
[03:26:20.720 --> 03:26:25.040]  what at your gut level do you think this is i think he's a patsy i agree
[03:26:25.040 --> 03:26:29.520]  yeah i think the i think that uh the room the
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:34.720]  suite in a hotel was staged staged as a prop for a photo
[03:26:34.720 --> 03:26:38.640]  for okay this is the guy he was the only one he did it
[03:26:38.640 --> 03:26:42.000]  and whether or not he actually fired weapons himself
[03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  he was not the only shooter and what we're really talking about in the big
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:50.480]  picture as always in these events we got to take the guns
[03:26:50.480 --> 03:26:53.840]  away from everybody everybody despite the fact that you know whether the
[03:26:53.840 --> 03:26:57.040]  weapon was legal or illegal banned or whatever that
[03:26:57.040 --> 03:27:01.440]  that the supposed shooter used you've got to take the guns away from the people
[03:27:01.440 --> 03:27:04.720]  who don't commit crimes at all and that's really going to solve the problem
[03:27:04.720 --> 03:27:08.400]  while the criminals and terrorists of course get the guns anyway
[03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:11.840]  we know that's an area and then on top of this
[03:27:11.840 --> 03:27:15.520]  the other big time agenda is surveillance state
[03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:19.680]  stepping that up ramping that up because now
[03:27:19.680 --> 03:27:23.120]  they can say well now we're sure that nobody is safe at any time
[03:27:23.120 --> 03:27:26.320]  sure everybody's got to wear a body camera that's that's all they'll stop
[03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:31.200]  this because we let him lug you know an armored fortress of weapons up there
[03:27:31.200 --> 03:27:35.280]  so because we didn't do our jobs now all of you have to lose even more of your
[03:27:35.280 --> 03:27:39.200]  rights here in the police state exactly and this is not just going to be
[03:27:39.200 --> 03:27:42.240]  america this is global and so you point to this event
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:46.000]  or what are you going to do if you go to a public restroom and a gas station
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:48.320]  there'll be a metal detector before i mean you know
[03:27:48.320 --> 03:27:51.680]  that's what they're writing trillions of dollars will be made by the whole
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:55.120]  securities infrastructure off of this there's your motive right there
[03:27:55.120 --> 03:27:57.840]  what about the target because i'm picking your brain we want to break here
[03:27:57.840 --> 03:28:01.120]  what what about the target john upport this group of flyover country trump
[03:28:01.120 --> 03:28:04.240]  supporters no question about it i mean you know
[03:28:04.240 --> 03:28:07.440]  you've always got to look at the target even though of course
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:11.680]  the mainstream blamestream people are avoiding that at all costs
[03:28:11.680 --> 03:28:16.480]  gee motive the target don't look at the target don't look at the target
[03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:20.800]  let's see uh there's trump supporters conservatives gun owners

[03:31:09.760 --> 03:31:16.080]  than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting
[03:31:16.080 --> 03:31:22.240]  killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have concentrated

[03:34:54.320 --> 03:35:04.800]  shots fired in the belogio hotel not the mandalay bay the belogio hotel yesterday at
[03:35:04.800 --> 03:35:11.760]  no more fake news i put up a video this was a personal video on a cell phone
[03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:20.240]  shot by a guest at the belogio on the night of the shooting at the concert
[03:35:20.240 --> 03:35:27.120]  her she is walking around in the lobby with her husband for six minutes plus talking and
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:33.280]  showing lots and lots of people standing in the lobby of the belogio hotel she is saying
[03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:40.880]  shots were fired through the the glass at the front door of the belogio that the hotel is on
[03:35:40.880 --> 03:35:49.120]  lockdown and no one's allowed on the casino floor and there are many many people standing around in
[03:35:49.120 --> 03:35:56.560]  the wake of all of this in the lobby that she is filming taping recording on her cell phone
[03:35:57.280 --> 03:36:09.120]  what are we to believe well what do you say well i can tell you this soon after i posted the video
[03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:20.800]  at no more fake news youtube took it down took it down on what basis well let's see it could be the
[03:36:20.800 --> 03:36:27.360]  truth therefore it's disturbing therefore we have to take it down it was filmed inside a casino in
[03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:35.600]  vegas therefore we have to take it down it was filmed by a woman and her husband we don't like
[03:36:35.600 --> 03:36:40.480]  that anymore what are we talking about you we found another link we reposted
[03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:49.120]  i had two separate other reports from people saying the same thing shots fired at the
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:54.160]  belogio hotel why is this important well obviously it's important on the same night
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:37:01.600]  as the concert shooting below the mandalay bay so now we really would be talking about multiple
[03:37:01.600 --> 03:37:08.960]  multiple shooters we would be talking about a lot of that not simply one and of course as alex
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:15.040]  pointed out i think in the last hour there's an all manner of police audio from the night of the
[03:37:15.040 --> 03:37:22.560]  concert shooting talking about multiple shooters not just one cop several cops back and forth back
[03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:31.920]  and forth multiple shooters different floors of the mandalay bay we have that we have the now
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:39.440]  famous taxi cab video of the woman taxi cab driver parked outside the mandalay bay hotel
[03:37:40.320 --> 03:37:45.360]  waiting in line and noticing that nobody is there what's happening inside the hotel
[03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:54.560]  she hears shots fired you can hear them yes there are echo effects and yes there's a bounce back
[03:37:54.560 --> 03:38:01.440]  and forth but you can also hear separate weapons being fired it's obvious they're not the same
[03:38:01.440 --> 03:38:08.880]  weapons that also suggests that in any kind of serious investigation multiple shooters would be
[03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:17.360]  at the front of the list these are important factors because they all point to not only mainstream
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:23.760]  media lying and lying and lying and the authorities that are supposedly investigating this horrific
[03:38:23.760 --> 03:38:30.320]  crime lying and lying and lying but it also points to agenda agenda agenda and as i said in the last
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:37.680]  segment of course it's take the guns away but it's also more more more surveillance state bigger and
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:46.800]  higher and deeper all the hotels are now going to have metal detectors and then it's also the agenda
[03:38:46.800 --> 03:38:51.120]  of well gee i don't think we should go to the football game this weekend honey you know it's
[03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:57.040]  outdoors 60 000 people and uh you know i'm not sure uh why don't we just get the so-and-so
[03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:02.800]  nfl package and stay at home and watch it on the big screen and more and more people i'm not just
[03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:10.400]  particularly talking about the nfl because they have their own problems but any public event
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:20.080]  of any size if more and more people can be convinced to stay away from malls from sporting
[03:39:20.080 --> 03:39:30.240]  events from theaters etc etc etc what happens to the economy agenda agenda agenda more and more
[03:39:30.240 --> 03:39:37.840]  and more so what happened in vegas feeds directly into this agenda in fact you could start looking
[03:39:37.840 --> 03:39:44.720]  up names like sheldon adelson and michael tertoff and you can see where perhaps these gentlemen
[03:39:44.720 --> 03:39:53.840]  would profit significantly from enhanced security backscatter x-ray machines and who knows what
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:40:02.720]  other kinds of detectors check it out for yourself agenda agenda agenda globalism globalism globalism
[03:40:02.720 --> 03:40:11.120]  because what is the key to globalist society in their plans in their imagery suppression of the
[03:40:11.120 --> 03:40:19.920]  population keep them down keep them in fear we will protect you you must rely on us we must
[03:40:19.920 --> 03:40:26.080]  put in a police state and a surveillance state and then everything is going to be okay and just to
[03:40:26.080 --> 03:40:38.240]  make sure we the globalists will enact fund back covertly stage all manner of horrific events to
[03:40:38.240 --> 03:40:44.160]  make sure that you are afraid that you continue to be afraid that you cower in the dark and that
[03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:50.160]  you pay allegiance to us because ultimately we are the only protection that you have so
[03:40:51.760 --> 03:41:01.200]  this is a very significant event in sin city vegas and as more and more evidence gathers
[03:41:01.200 --> 03:41:09.920]  that this is not the event that the media are painting not in any any case that it's looking
[03:41:09.920 --> 03:41:18.000]  more and more like the hotel suite at the mandalay bay where steve and paula paddock was saying
[03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:28.800]  is a stage prop that all the weapons there he could never use never use but they make a terrific
[03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:36.240]  presentation for the people who want to take guns away you see this is what you get when you allow
[03:41:36.240 --> 03:41:44.720]  people to have guns this is what you get this was not a guy with just one gun this was a guy
[03:41:44.720 --> 03:41:54.080]  with a gigantic suite full of guns getting the message getting the message and so when i say
[03:41:55.040 --> 03:42:02.000]  how did this guy get all these suitcases with 23 weapons up to his hotel suite in a city where
[03:42:02.000 --> 03:42:10.640]  the surveillance never quits that's a key question because we're talking about a stage event and a
[03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:20.000]  prop a photologue so there isn't any way that we could easily say well no problem he just keeps
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:30.000]  taking stuff up and down sure he does a well-known high stakes gambler in vegas right who shows up
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:37.520]  and plays some kind of supposedly fantastic video poker for a hundred thousand dollars
[03:42:40.240 --> 03:42:44.640]  and he's just plugging weapons up to his room and there's no problem
[03:42:46.640 --> 03:42:50.720]  it's john rappin port we will be back on inch rewards after the break
[03:42:52.160 --> 03:42:57.600]  prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even realtor.com is
[03:42:57.600 --> 03:43:02.000]  writing about it but the realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set

[03:43:07.600 --> 03:43:12.640]  well the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers but the grasshoppers will still
[03:43:12.640 --> 03:43:17.280]  sing the tune if they can make money but maybe you don't have a hollywood mansion where you can drop

[03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:28.400]  jone rep aboard here in the fourth hour sitting in for alex we're talking about
[03:47:29.520 --> 03:47:37.120]  vegas baby we're talking about the globalist agenda we're talking about stage prompts we're
[03:47:37.120 --> 03:47:44.880]  talking about path see the path see the setup you know there are people out there that just can't
[03:47:44.880 --> 03:47:53.280]  grasp it they can't grasp the big globalist agenda and they can't grasp the idea that these
[03:47:53.280 --> 03:48:00.720]  operations can be complicated in other words how you set up the path see how you profile and choose
[03:48:00.720 --> 03:48:09.440]  the path see how you recruit the path see how you get somebody involved and then the house comes
[03:48:09.440 --> 03:48:17.360]  crashing down on their heads and you're free and clear gone gone with the wind people don't think
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:24.000]  this actually happens they don't think it's possible but if they spent a few hours looking
[03:48:24.000 --> 03:48:32.640]  into the assassination of jfk or his brother bobby or martin luther king they would soon see that
[03:48:32.640 --> 03:48:41.440]  it's not only possible but it happens all the time in the case of the 1968 assassination of bobby
[03:48:41.440 --> 03:48:48.560]  kennedy at the ambassador hotel in los angeles kennedy who was running for president was gaining
[03:48:48.560 --> 03:48:56.000]  in the cold bobby walks into the kitchen of the ambassador hotel after his speech is over and he
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:04.960]  shot and killed and all of a sudden this prime candidate for presidency his murder is being
[03:49:04.960 --> 03:49:14.160]  investigated by who the fbi absolutely not a special unit is set up inside notoriously corrupt
[03:49:14.160 --> 03:49:25.040]  la pd called special unit senator s us to investigate the crime and what do they discover
[03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:32.800]  and not say and bury and try to bury forever that the shots that killed bobby kennedy came
[03:49:32.800 --> 03:49:41.120]  from behind him in the kitchen and the presumed assassin who eventually confessed and is still
[03:49:41.120 --> 03:49:48.960]  in prison sir hand sir hand had a gun was standing in front of bobby kennedy and therefore could
[03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:56.080]  never have fired the shots that killed him because those shots came from behind and not only that
[03:49:56.080 --> 03:50:03.200]  the number of shots fired in the kitchen at the ambassador hotel were more than were contained
[03:50:03.200 --> 03:50:07.600]  in the clip of the gun that sir hand sir hand was holding in his hand
[03:50:07.600 --> 03:50:20.000]  that's a slam dunk that's a passing that's the way it's done that explains a great deal
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:28.080]  of modern american history as it turns out if you look at these events but it was all
[03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:34.480]  swept under the carpet and suppressed until researchers began coming out with the truth
[03:50:34.480 --> 03:50:40.560]  and the books and the evidence and it piled up higher and higher and higher until that special
[03:50:40.560 --> 03:50:54.240]  unit senator at la pd stank to high heaven but nothing changed the passing was the passing
[03:50:55.520 --> 03:51:01.040]  and the public well he must have been the guy after all the evidence must have been
[03:51:01.040 --> 03:51:06.240]  overwhelmed no the evidence wasn't overwhelmed it never was overwhelmed it was nowhere to begin
[03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:13.520]  with that's the way it is and so as we see the leaking of more and more information in the vegas
[03:51:13.520 --> 03:51:21.040]  shooter case about this guy and his life and his background yeah i think you know i'm going to plan
[03:51:21.040 --> 03:51:27.360]  this incredible event where i'm going to kill all these people in about six months and maybe a year
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:34.240]  i'm really going to work it out so that the final uh as the curtain falls it's going to be my
[03:51:34.880 --> 03:51:42.400]  suicide by cop that's what i really want i'm a millionaire retired real estate investor
[03:51:43.680 --> 03:51:48.000]  could do anything i want to but this is really what i wanted to
[03:51:49.520 --> 03:51:56.400]  sure now does that kind of thing ever happen yes it could but i mean if you're a serious
[03:51:56.400 --> 03:52:02.400]  investigator in this case you aren't going to accept that a face of value are you kidding
[03:52:03.120 --> 03:52:11.040]  that this would be the guy to plan all this and carry it out for the purpose of suiciding
[03:52:11.040 --> 03:52:19.680]  himself by cop are you serious okay he was taking value yes we know that in certain people that
[03:52:19.680 --> 03:52:27.360]  causes more aggressive behavior impossibly aggressive that's not the same thing as a long-range plan
[03:52:28.640 --> 03:52:34.480]  to cause tremendous human destruction at the end of which he is killed by the cops
[03:52:35.360 --> 03:52:40.800]  now some stories are now saying well he had an escape plan uh you know patched it just didn't
[03:52:40.800 --> 03:52:48.880]  work out oh sure are you kidding me this guy if he had ever managed to escape that sweet
[03:52:48.880 --> 03:52:55.520]  would have been hunted down for the rest of his life that's the existence that he wanted
[03:52:55.520 --> 03:53:01.600]  that would have been with his being killed or put in chains and dragged back i don't think so
[03:53:02.960 --> 03:53:09.360]  makes no sense it certainly doesn't make enough sense to say we bow down to the major
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:14.560]  police media we accept whatever you say if you say it was a loan shooter it had to be a loan
[03:53:14.560 --> 03:53:20.400]  shooter no question about it we don't want to listen to the police video audio of multiple
[03:53:20.400 --> 03:53:26.720]  shooters being reported by multiple cops we don't want to listen to the audio of the taxi cab
[03:53:26.720 --> 03:53:33.120]  video out in front of the mandalay hotel that shows multiple weapons being used despite the
[03:53:33.120 --> 03:53:40.560]  echo effects no we don't want to know any of that all we want to know is what does media major media
[03:53:40.560 --> 03:53:50.480]  tell us and we will obey really that seesaw is really flopping over folks there is now
[03:53:51.120 --> 03:54:00.800]  a huge rising tsunami of people that don't buy in do not buy in to these police press conferences
[03:54:00.800 --> 03:54:07.600]  forever well yes it looks like you know probably had help yes okay we'll we'll go with that now
[03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:13.520]  yes okay we're on the case we're determining the motive we may never find out the motive but you
[03:54:13.520 --> 03:54:22.560]  know what could made this man so sick and both of them baby baby baby no what about the multiple
[03:54:22.560 --> 03:54:31.120]  shooter how about telling us once and for all the actual gun that paddock supposedly was using or
[03:54:31.120 --> 03:54:39.280]  the guns in the broken windows in the mandalay what about shooters on the ground that's a subject
[03:54:39.280 --> 03:54:45.200]  i don't have time to get into in any death here but what about that possibility shooters at the
[03:54:45.200 --> 03:54:56.800]  concert on the ground and i'll give you a for instance here it is go look at all the video
[03:54:56.800 --> 03:55:02.800]  you could find of the melee and the confusion and the chaos on the ground at the concert
[03:55:03.840 --> 03:55:13.680]  and tell me how many bullet ricochets you hear understand what that is a bounce from a high
[03:55:13.680 --> 03:55:24.160]  powered weapon because with all of the rounds purportedly fired down at the crowd surely in
[03:55:24.160 --> 03:55:33.280]  the video taken at ground level you would hear not just a few but many many many many many many
[03:55:33.280 --> 03:55:42.800]  ricochets tremendous thuds as bullets hit solid objects and perhaps other sounds whining sounds
[03:55:42.800 --> 03:55:52.960]  and bouncing sound all kinds of sounds where are they where are they if all the shots were really
[03:55:52.960 --> 03:56:04.000]  fired from the mandalay bay hotel what about other shooters with say silenced weapons at ground
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:13.440]  level what about that well he's just speculating no no because where are all the ricochet sounds
[03:56:13.440 --> 03:56:20.480]  that you should be hearing but aren't that's not speculation folks you see what i'm driving at
[03:56:20.480 --> 03:56:28.480]  i'm driving at what every reporter who's ever looked into one of these events
[03:56:30.320 --> 03:56:36.480]  is saying which is how about an actual real honest investigation
[03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:44.400]  that looks where it should look such as where i just described what about that
[03:56:44.400 --> 03:56:54.960]  why can't we have that why not why not it's a vastly legitimate question and the point that
[03:56:54.960 --> 03:57:01.600]  i just made about the ricochets is one that you ought to think about because if this was
[03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:10.800]  legit video taken at the legit concert on the ground that's what you would be hearing in profusion
[03:57:10.800 --> 03:57:19.040]  we've reached the end of the line here for today's show this is john rappaport for info wars i
