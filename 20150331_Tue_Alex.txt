[00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:04.978]  Big Brother.
[00:00:04.978 --> 00:00:05.698]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:08.040]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.801]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.382]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:12.942]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:17.125]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.647]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:23.869]  Already the final day of March 2015.
[00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.672]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, back in studio in Austin, Texas from a visit to California.
[00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:31.912]  A ton of news coming up.
[00:00:31.912 --> 00:00:39.315]  But first, an in-depth look at the exciting legislation moving through Congress to repeal the Patriot Act and the illegal NSA spying.
[00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:40.196]  John Bowne reports.
[00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:48.778]  Congressman Thomas Massey, Republican of Kentucky, and Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, need your support.
[00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:54.199]  Earlier this week, they introduced legislation into the House to abolish the Patriot Act.
[00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.539]  You know, the Patriot Act.
[00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.941]  The cancer that's been metastasizing the body politics since three days after the 9-11 attacks.
[00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.602]  The bill, dubbed the Surveillance State Repeal Act, H.R. 1466,
[00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.403]  Would prohibit U.S.
[00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:16.806]  spooks from plating back doors into technology, as well as provide extended protections for whistleblowers such as Edward Snowden.
[00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:22.088]  In addition to repealing the Patriot Act, legislation would also abolish the 2008 FISA Amendments Act.
[00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.093]  Which the NSA has largely used to claim its mass spying programs are legal.
[00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:41.661]  HR 1466 states that any future snooping involving American citizens would be subject to strict oversight and require warrants in all cases as well as probable cause.
[00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:49.666]  The legislation would also prohibit the government from forcing tech companies to install back doors in their products to enable NSA surveillance.
[00:01:50.106 --> 00:02:02.152]  Surveillance law enforcement lobbying groups have been pushing for some time, while security experts and those within the tech sector claim the NSA backdoors will have disastrous consequences.
[00:02:02.152 --> 00:02:07.334]  The new legislation would also provide for an independent controller to receive complaints from whistleblowers.
[00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:12.695]  And to protect them by reporting any valid information to Congress on their behalf.
[00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:30.619]  Unfortunately, the bill stands very little chance of passing given that so many bought and paid for representatives in Congress largely support the unconstitutional Patriot Act because their hands are tied by special interests and their minds clouded by hubris.
[00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.320]  There is too much money in this process of doing bulk acquisition of data.
[00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:43.754]  That's their motive, to keep having the money flow and keep that going.
[00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:47.359]  Changing that particular procedure is rather difficult, even within government.
[00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:53.562]  This money comes out and goes to corporations that are in the constituent areas of the representatives and senators.
[00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:56.886]  So they have a vested interest in also keeping this going.
[00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:59.649]  So the only way to do it is to raise up as a public.
[00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:01.632]  We have to start standing up as Americans.
[00:03:01.632 --> 00:03:05.296]  Americans aren't supposed to sit back and let things happen and let...
[00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:08.299]  Let government do what it does.
[00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.900]  We're supposed to be out there challenging.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.042]  We have to be participating in our democracy and republic.
[00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:16.723]  We cannot sit by and let these things happen and be quiet.
[00:03:16.723 --> 00:03:21.366]  If we do, we're going to get this totalitarian state that we're sliding toward right now.
[00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:25.107]  You can't sit there and say you don't have any power.
[00:03:25.107 --> 00:03:26.787]  You really do have power.
[00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:35.649]  And the power is to talk to your representatives and senators and complain to them and make sure that this is a major concern to you.
[00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:47.131]  And when they come around to give you town meetings and talk to you and get your vote, stand up and address them and make them publicly come out with a statement of their position on this issue.
[00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:52.552]  If you don't, I mean, they're going to continue doing what they are doing right now.
[00:03:52.552 --> 00:04:04.734]  They simply say they're assuming, because now if you're not complaining, they're assuming that you're okay with everything they do or they feel they can do anything and the country will accept it.
[00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:12.456]  And as long as they keep saying things and not telling the truth and exposing what's really going on, they can keep you in the dark and you'll never know.
[00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:18.901]  Do you want a peaceful solution to the madness of Big Brother's unwarranted overreach into our lives?
[00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:25.926]  Flood those phones and demand your representative rehabilitate our Constitution by voting in favor of H.R.
[00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:27.807]  1466.
[00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:29.269]  Take your power back.
[00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.051]  This country belongs to we, the people.
[00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.613]  Representatives can be identified and contacted here.
[00:04:35.613 --> 00:04:36.794]  I live in America.
[00:04:36.794 --> 00:04:37.195]  Right on.
[00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:37.915]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:39.336]  Another high five.
[00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:41.298]  John Bowden for Infowars.com
[00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:48.795]  And that video with the contact points to Congress is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:49.775]  I am wound up.
[00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:52.156]  There is a ton of vital news straight ahead.
[00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:57.179]  So stay with us and tell your friends and family, tune in right now, because this transmission is going to be powerful.
[00:04:58.814 --> 00:04:59.775]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:00.335]  Good, brother.
[00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:02.297]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:04.019]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:08.023]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:10.665]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:13.088]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.

[00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:30.726]  Saving a ton of money there.
[00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:36.032]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated
[00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:38.573]  Concentrated or maximum potency.
[00:05:38.573 --> 00:05:50.578]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while But then burn you out in my experience where stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source So it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.069]  Another major health threat.
[00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:05.051]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:07.712]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[00:07:07.712 --> 00:07:14.774]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[00:07:14.774 --> 00:07:17.735]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[00:07:17.735 --> 00:07:20.696]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[00:07:20.696 --> 00:07:22.716]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[00:07:22.716 --> 00:07:25.577]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:31.379]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.881]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.982]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:22.699]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:24.599]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:26.119]  Where to begin?
[00:08:45.694 --> 00:08:50.075]  I have returned to California, formerly part of the United States.
[00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:54.397]  I have a lot of observations about that.
[00:08:54.397 --> 00:09:02.219]  Obviously the world is degenerating quickly when it comes to destabilization.
[00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:08.421]  Simply put, the news and information we have to cover today is over the top and it's just intensifying.
[00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:10.922]  But there is certainly some good news as well.
[00:09:10.922 --> 00:09:11.642]  People are
[00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:24.053]  They're starting to really do their own research and find out that we are in peril if we do not reverse the course that we're on.
[00:09:24.053 --> 00:09:26.816]  We have a lot of updates on Jade Helm today.
[00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:38.913]  The Washington Post comes out and says, why Operation Jade Helm 15 is freaking out the internet, and why it shouldn't be.
[00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:41.314]  And it's another whitewash.
[00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:48.417]  This was on the cover of one of the main sections of the Washington Post today.
[00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:57.581]  As it was on the cover of Metro and State, I guess last Thursday, here where I live, on the cover of that section of the paper,
[00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:07.509]  A regurgitation almost word for word if you compare the articles to the Dallas Morning News and the Houston Chronicle and a bunch of other papers.
[00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:18.494]  This stuff is being basically put out by Pentagon PR teams and then regurgitated with only a few of the words changed so it isn't open plagiarism.
[00:10:18.494 --> 00:10:19.294]  Pretty amazing.
[00:10:25.737 --> 00:10:29.900]  But the good news is the Washington Post links to our articles and tweets.
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:43.011]  Beyond Denial, Preparation for Martial Law in America, that Joe Biggs tweeted out, the article that Paul Watson and I wrote last Friday, that we need to continue to get out to everybody.
[00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:46.153]  Joe Biggs took action, will you, with that story.
[00:10:46.153 --> 00:10:50.957]  If Operation Jade Helm were happening in any other country, it would be immediately labeled for martial law.
[00:10:55.114 --> 00:10:59.335]  So that's just some of the tweets that were sent out.
[00:10:59.335 --> 00:10:59.795]  Breaking!
[00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:01.796]  Jade Helm 15 is martial law in the USA.
[00:11:01.796 --> 00:11:07.317]  And then they put a link to Russian armed insurgents in the USA, a separate story that we didn't put out.
[00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:13.719]  That's how they all mix it together to confuse people and then claim that we're saying things like that.
[00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:15.919]  The good news is people are really starting to get it.
[00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:18.900]  As I mentioned, DrudgeReport.com today has linked to this story.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.861]  Nationwide emergency alert test causes panic and confusion.
[00:11:23.905 --> 00:11:28.226]  TV viewers across America see unexpected message.
[00:11:28.226 --> 00:11:36.167]  Now a lot of people get upset by this, having presidential messages on their phone, seeing their television taken over and saying prepare for civil emergency.
[00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:41.228]  Because folks understand that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:11:41.228 --> 00:11:43.208]  That we're not in Mayberry anymore.
[00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:45.649]  That we are becoming a tyranny.
[00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:52.190]  And that's why folks have resonated with our warning about Jade Helm since day one, now over two weeks ago.
[00:11:53.607 --> 00:12:01.189]  We said, this is not a takeover this summer that will be actual martial law.
[00:12:01.189 --> 00:12:08.030]  It is in preparation to condition the troops, the local governments, and the population, and to test media control.
[00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:16.432]  And that's what they're doing now is wargaming this to try to see if they can sell the idea of permanent military occupation on our streets.
[00:12:16.432 --> 00:12:20.353]  And it's been in hundreds of government-issued publications.
[00:12:20.353 --> 00:12:21.273]  That's a conservative number.
[00:12:22.253 --> 00:12:38.562]  Stars and Stripes, Army Times, we've made films, we've made special reports, we've shown you, the Washington Post, the New York Times, how we need troops on the streets permanently, and we need checkpoints at the malls, and we need NSA spying to keep you safe.
[00:12:38.562 --> 00:12:44.526]  But the border's going to be wide open, and we need to go after the Tea Party and gun owners, and MSNBC says it's good!
[00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:50.379]  That the IRS is going after veterans groups and Christian groups and the Tea Party groups.
[00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:50.859]  Good!
[00:12:50.859 --> 00:12:51.860]  Arrest them!
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.803]  They shouldn't have speech!
[00:12:53.803 --> 00:13:02.573]  We've played those hardcore, flaming authoritarian statements here.
[00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:04.575]  I mean, hardcore!
[00:13:05.922 --> 00:13:20.349]  And you've seen the mainstream news articles about, is it reasonable Fort Hood General told soldiers that if they are part of the Tea Party or Evangelical Christian, they will be court-martialed.
[00:13:20.349 --> 00:13:23.751]  I mean, the military under the First Amendment are allowed to be Satanist.
[00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:32.555]  I don't like that, but you can read Austin American Statesman articles and Colleen newspaper articles about the giant satanic
[00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:45.450]  Parties they throw in public at parks on the base with orgies and you name it and the police go, well, it's their religious right.
[00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.872]  By the way, folks won't believe that if they're new viewers or listeners.
[00:13:49.872 --> 00:13:51.233]  That's the kind of thing the news does too.
[00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:55.454]  They'll say Jones claims they're having satanic orgies at Fort Hood.
[00:13:55.454 --> 00:14:02.077]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you go pull up the news articles about satanic masses and
[00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:05.722]  I know it's different, but it crosses over.
[00:14:05.722 --> 00:14:09.126]  Wiccan masses and the parties, that's part of it.
[00:14:09.126 --> 00:14:17.856]  And just like the Hopi Indians can take mescaline peyote and not get in trouble, they have religious ceremonies.
[00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.217]  It's their religion.
[00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:22.741]  The occultists, the Satanists,
[00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:27.053]  Are having these type of parties and it's on record.
[00:14:27.053 --> 00:14:30.896]  Anybody can pull up Satanist on U.S.
[00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:32.677]  military, Satanist chaplains, U.S.
[00:14:32.677 --> 00:14:33.257]  military.
[00:14:33.257 --> 00:14:34.538]  It's been all over the news.
[00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:40.622]  But they think the public's stupid so they'll probably have a news article about that saying Jones claims they're having satanic meetings on bases.
[00:14:40.622 --> 00:14:49.628]  My issue is you can be a Buddhist, you could be a Satanist, you could be an agnostic, you could be a Hindu, you could be a Muslim, you could be a Baptist.
[00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:51.449]  Evangelical is one of the biggest
[00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:59.473]  In fact, as we pull that article out, it's one of our articles that links to Fox News, I want to put that on screen for folks.
[00:14:59.473 --> 00:15:09.703]  Just since I mentioned this right now, it was about two years ago, and the headline is Evangelicals Tea Party, soldiers told not to be part of the tea party.
[00:15:10.604 --> 00:15:11.745]  Or Evangelical Church.
[00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:12.707]  I mean, that's the headline.
[00:15:12.707 --> 00:15:13.988]  I want to put it on screen.
[00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:14.629]  I want to get it there.
[00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:22.938]  I want people to see this so they can understand that in America has gotten so totalitarian that the commanding general, and he backed off once he got heat.
[00:15:22.938 --> 00:15:23.919]  There it is.
[00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.561]  Does Army consider Christians Tea Party?
[00:15:26.596 --> 00:15:27.357]  A terror threat.
[00:15:27.357 --> 00:15:29.719]  That was the Fox News whitewash.
[00:15:29.719 --> 00:15:30.900]  Let's actually click on the link.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.620]  There it is.
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.124]  And when you scroll down, Fox reports it like it might be reasonable.
[00:15:36.124 --> 00:15:37.785]  It doesn't say you have a First Amendment.
[00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:44.591]  How dare them say you can't be part of the evangelical church, probably the second biggest Christian denomination in the U.S., maybe third biggest.
[00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:45.752]  You can debate it.
[00:15:45.752 --> 00:15:53.839]  How dare them say that you can be court-martialed and it violates the military code of justice to, quote, be in the Tea Party or evangelical.
[00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:54.559]  Boom!
[00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:55.339]  Fox News!
[00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:55.899]  Boom!
[00:15:55.899 --> 00:15:56.480]  Boom!
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.040]  Boom!
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.160]  Boom!
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:06.922]  But you can have a satanic party at Fort Hood and people running around naked having sex in the middle of a park.
[00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:12.644]  Well, it's a religious ceremony.
[00:16:12.644 --> 00:16:16.805]  So, that's what I was getting at, is that truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:26.914]  And you've got this whole backdrop of the FCC grabbing the internet and all these EAS alerts and we've got footage here.
[00:16:26.914 --> 00:16:30.177]  Video shows troops trying to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:16:30.177 --> 00:16:33.761]  They've got black helicopters flying around landing.
[00:16:33.761 --> 00:16:36.884]  And then you've got people being rounded up and being marched.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.383]  On to white vans and disappeared.
[00:16:42.383 --> 00:16:47.026]  And then we had the G20 that my reporters were at in Pittsburgh, I don't know, five years ago.
[00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:54.411]  And footage of a car pulling up, troops jumping out, grabbing protesters, shoving them in.
[00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:57.053]  I mean, just Google snatch and grab at G20.
[00:16:57.053 --> 00:16:57.973]  And then disappearing them.
[00:16:57.973 --> 00:17:01.096]  And then it happened the next year in Canada at the G20.
[00:17:01.096 --> 00:17:02.837]  And then it happened the next year in England.
[00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:13.676]  I mean, they just pull up, grab peaceful people, people in military uniforms, and disappear them.
[00:17:13.676 --> 00:17:24.543]  And then I was watching on the plane back on American Airlines last night, where they propagandize you with NBC, Universal Propaganda, the show Chicago PD.
[00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:27.645]  I'm going to talk about that coming up.
[00:17:27.645 --> 00:17:34.749]  It was a pretty good show, entertaining, had me supporting torture by the end of it, at an unconscious level.
[00:17:36.465 --> 00:17:44.540]  Because the guy is a good cop, he means well, and at the end, you know, he was doing it all just to get a diamond ring back that belongs to his dead wife or whatever to give to his son-in-law.
[00:17:48.797 --> 00:17:54.480]  But he tortures everybody and takes them to secret sites to torture them, which the Chicago PD really has.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:06.826]  And these shows are there to be a mind control narrative to make good men and women think they're doing illegal things and involve in illegal conspiracies to protect America.
[00:18:06.826 --> 00:18:08.727]  And it even had army propaganda in it.
[00:18:08.727 --> 00:18:10.188]  And again, I'm not against the army itself.
[00:18:10.188 --> 00:18:13.270]  I'm against the propaganda to turn it into a total tyranny.
[00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:18.361]  And it's all these shows are just pure brainwashing.
[00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:22.486]  You add all this together, it's incredible.
[00:18:22.486 --> 00:18:26.331]  And the Washington Post says, don't freak out about militarization of police.
[00:18:26.331 --> 00:18:28.213]  Don't freak out about the Patriot Act.
[00:18:28.213 --> 00:18:29.975]  Don't freak out about the NSA.
[00:18:29.975 --> 00:18:30.957]  Don't freak out about...
[00:18:32.395 --> 00:18:38.337]  A ten-state military operation with people posing as civilians, quote, doing suspicious things.
[00:18:38.337 --> 00:18:39.718]  It's all a conditioning op.
[00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:42.979]  And I told you it's going to have elements that are for overseas.
[00:18:42.979 --> 00:18:45.900]  All these massive operations do.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:53.562]  And Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday about how it is for attacks on Iran and Syria.
[00:18:53.562 --> 00:18:55.083]  Of course they're going to be doing some practice
[00:18:56.411 --> 00:18:57.852]  For that as well.
[00:18:57.852 --> 00:19:15.028]  But all this is about, at the bottom line, is death squads, openly operating where the helicopters show up, the spec ops show up, they take you out, they kill you or they disappear you, as just the next level of intimidation.
[00:19:15.028 --> 00:19:21.514]  And this is all about a criminal government trying to maneuver the military, the armed services, into this treasonous role.
[00:19:23.649 --> 00:19:25.089]  And let me just give everybody news.
[00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:29.211]  I see this statement put out by PSYOPS all over the news that there is a civil war in America.
[00:19:29.211 --> 00:19:30.391]  We're going to crush the Tea Party.
[00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:33.612]  You can't deal with helicopters, spec ops, and L-fires.
[00:19:33.612 --> 00:19:34.452]  Yeah.
[00:19:34.452 --> 00:19:43.575]  If a civil war breaks out, the patriots aren't going to sit in their houses and wait for the helicopters to come.
[00:19:43.575 --> 00:19:48.656]  The patriots would just go out and engage the political class that runs all this and end this very quickly.
[00:19:50.205 --> 00:19:59.809]  So just step aside, step around the brainwashed troops, and the patriots are going to go right at the politicos, right at the generals that are running this.
[00:19:59.809 --> 00:20:09.414]  As the new world order continues to tighten its grip on every facet of our lives, we're all asking ourselves, how can we maintain our independence?
[00:20:09.414 --> 00:20:10.974]  The answer is clear.
[00:20:10.974 --> 00:20:13.556]  Get prepared and you get prepared now.
[00:20:13.556 --> 00:20:16.117]  Now the only question left is where do we begin?

[00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:27.298]  And everybody knows...
[00:24:39.164 --> 00:24:43.008]  Everybody knows.
[00:24:43.008 --> 00:24:44.129]  Everybody knows.
[00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:48.693]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking.
[00:24:48.693 --> 00:24:53.318]  Everybody knows the captain lied.
[00:24:53.318 --> 00:24:57.141]  Everybody got this broken feeling.
[00:24:58.182 --> 00:25:01.444]  Everybody knows.
[00:25:01.444 --> 00:25:02.365]  Everybody knows.
[00:25:02.365 --> 00:25:04.406]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:25:04.406 --> 00:25:05.006]  to 2 p.m.
[00:25:05.006 --> 00:25:05.967]  Central Time.
[00:25:05.967 --> 00:25:08.549]  I go under the knife tomorrow,
[00:25:25.097 --> 00:25:28.532]  Tomorrow morning, get my hernia that I've had for 14 years fixed.
[00:25:28.532 --> 00:25:30.018]  I have lost so much weight.
[00:25:32.508 --> 00:25:35.489]  I have a long torso, and I sit down and still have a tiny little pot belly.
[00:25:35.489 --> 00:25:36.990]  I mean, it folds over my pants.
[00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:47.375]  It is one-tenth what it was, and so now that that's actually gotten so small, and I've lost so much fat internally that I actually have a little piece of intestine sticking out.
[00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:48.115]  It's not very fun.
[00:25:48.115 --> 00:25:49.416]  It doesn't feel very good.
[00:25:49.416 --> 00:25:58.361]  It's sticking out right now, and I'm going to have that sucker fixed tomorrow by a great doctor, so say your prayers for the info war, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
[00:25:58.361 --> 00:26:00.162]  It's all in God's hands.
[00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:06.539]  And then I should be back in a couple days if there aren't any complications.
[00:26:06.539 --> 00:26:13.129]  But I did wait 14 years, so the hole has gotten to be about the size of a silver dollar.
[00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:14.672]  Silver dollar right in my belly button.
[00:26:16.184 --> 00:26:17.124]  So that is coming up.
[00:26:17.124 --> 00:26:19.705]  David Knight's been doing a great job while I've been out of town.
[00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:20.746]  He's not filling in.
[00:26:20.746 --> 00:26:23.327]  He's hosting the InfoWar.
[00:26:23.327 --> 00:26:25.108]  My reporters aren't filling in on the nightly news.
[00:26:25.108 --> 00:26:26.488]  They are the anchors.
[00:26:26.488 --> 00:26:28.029]  They are the reporters and they are kicking butt.
[00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:33.371]  I tell you, they've gotten better and better as I've basically thrown them in the deep end.
[00:26:33.371 --> 00:26:34.992]  Most of the novices have never been in media.
[00:26:34.992 --> 00:26:36.132]  David's been in media.
[00:26:36.132 --> 00:26:39.133]  And they've just really turned up to do a crackerjack job.
[00:26:39.133 --> 00:26:42.495]  And they're teleprompter-free, something mainstream media folks should never do.
[00:26:44.437 --> 00:26:53.408]  Now where to begin here because I kind of went off into a jag about Jade Helm and the rest of it.
[00:26:53.408 --> 00:27:04.041]  We do have Dr. Mercola joining us in the third hour to cover some very positive news and to break down a higher order of killing.
[00:27:07.895 --> 00:27:11.057]  Killing Us Softly, the soft kill program.
[00:27:11.057 --> 00:27:15.140]  Here's CBS News, human birth control chemical.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.222]  CBS News, wow!
[00:27:17.222 --> 00:27:32.013]  You can Google Alex Jones BPA juice boxes and find over a hundred articles and national TV, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, saying I'm a total kook six years ago and right through to today.
[00:27:32.013 --> 00:27:33.134]  When I say over a hundred, it's probably like 300.
[00:27:35.766 --> 00:27:39.910]  That BPA is not a birth control chemical.
[00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:40.751]  And that I'm lying.
[00:27:40.751 --> 00:27:44.635]  And that it doesn't change your sexual preference.
[00:27:44.635 --> 00:27:49.139]  Human birth control chemical BPA caused lower fertility in fish, government scientists say.
[00:27:49.139 --> 00:27:52.943]  And then it goes on to report it basically also changed their sexuality.
[00:27:54.184 --> 00:27:59.187]  Many cases giving them basically both sexual organs in their development.
[00:27:59.187 --> 00:28:07.313]  A newly released research from the US government side has found a chemical in birth control pills and the chemical BPA, oh, affects the fertility of fish.
[00:28:07.313 --> 00:28:14.438]  So what they put in the plastic, those little microwave liners, and the rest of it is what
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:27.987]  You put in birth control pills, and we wonder why men are so feminine, and so fat, and so weak, and so pathetic, and why they suddenly want to climb and be with another man.
[00:28:27.987 --> 00:28:29.208]  It's this.
[00:28:29.208 --> 00:28:36.112]  And I'm not bashing people who genetically have predispositions.
[00:28:36.112 --> 00:28:40.515]  And this is a complex issue, and it's a spiritual issue as well, but I don't judge people.
[00:28:40.515 --> 00:28:41.675]  And I don't hate people.
[00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:44.037]  I don't get thrown a high horse because of somebody else's
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.362]  sexual proclivities if it isn't directed at children or innocence.
[00:28:50.362 --> 00:28:52.322]  I'm not a hypocrite.
[00:28:52.322 --> 00:28:54.183]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[00:28:54.183 --> 00:28:57.884]  But this is a subject I'm going to talk about with Mercola.
[00:28:57.884 --> 00:29:01.646]  This is some big victories we're having in the third hour.
[00:29:01.646 --> 00:29:13.050]  Because of the chemicals in utero, and Dr. Gribbs talked about this, but I've had medical doctors like Dr. Blaylock on talking about it as well, you will have, and they've now done brain scans, they've now done autopsies,
[00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:20.887]  On people that have gone out and had sex changes, and in most cases, they have a woman's brain.
[00:29:20.887 --> 00:29:23.730]  Or there's women that have basically a man's brain.
[00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.853]  There's major physiological differences.
[00:29:25.853 --> 00:29:30.938]  First thing is there's three times the connections between a female brain, left and right hemisphere, than there is in a male.
[00:29:30.938 --> 00:29:36.725]  And they just go into autopsies on people that commit suicide and stuff that are... And my God, they got a woman's brain, so...
[00:29:38.322 --> 00:29:40.163]  This was done though through the chemicals.
[00:29:40.163 --> 00:29:42.483]  Before it happened, sometimes it was very rare.
[00:29:42.483 --> 00:29:44.564]  Maybe 2% of the population total.
[00:29:44.564 --> 00:29:48.425]  Now it's going to skyrocket up to the majority.
[00:29:48.425 --> 00:29:49.825]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.825 --> 00:29:52.366]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.366 --> 00:29:55.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.165 --> 00:30:08.830]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super-oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:18.755]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[00:30:18.755 --> 00:30:21.677]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body,
[00:30:21.877 --> 00:30:22.498]  I think so.
[00:30:36.852 --> 00:30:37.092]  We're good.
[00:30:59.036 --> 00:31:00.357]  The experts are clear.
[00:31:00.357 --> 00:31:07.464]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[00:31:07.464 --> 00:31:13.750]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarsline.com.
[00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.494]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula.
[00:31:17.494 --> 00:31:21.318]  Coming from a deep earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[00:31:21.678 --> 00:31:27.000]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.001]  Not our iodine.
[00:31:28.001 --> 00:31:31.823]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:34.364]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[00:32:10.108 --> 00:32:14.912]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:32:14.912 --> 00:32:18.475]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:32:18.475 --> 00:32:20.456]  No needles, no injections.

[00:32:33.185 --> 00:32:37.328]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[00:32:37.328 --> 00:32:42.291]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:46.934]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[00:32:46.934 --> 00:32:50.417]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[00:32:50.417 --> 00:32:53.879]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:53.879 --> 00:32:55.680]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:08.531]  You want answers?
[00:33:08.531 --> 00:33:10.653]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:10.653 --> 00:33:15.158]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.279 --> 00:33:34.968]  Konstantin Sivkov, one of the top geopolitical analysts in Russia, speaking at the Moscow Economic Forum, and he has Putin's ear, called for nuclear attack on Yellowstone National Park to trigger the supervolcano.
[00:33:34.968 --> 00:33:48.517]  The consequences will be catastrophic for the United States, and also an attack, I guess, by sappers, by infiltration teams, by sleeper teams, to set nukes off on the San Andreas Fault.
[00:33:51.209 --> 00:33:52.250]  You can't make that up.
[00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:54.571]  That's on mainline Russian TV right now.
[00:33:54.571 --> 00:33:58.753]  The next generation of weapons that Russia will use against the United States in World War III.
[00:33:58.753 --> 00:34:01.154]  We're going to break this down in the next hour.
[00:34:01.154 --> 00:34:07.198]  And it ties into a letter that was mailed on the 26th to these offices that I'm not going to show on air.
[00:34:07.198 --> 00:34:16.663]  Where someone claiming to be inside the military system basically said the same thing.
[00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:19.364]  And when the nukes will go off.
[00:34:19.364 --> 00:34:20.545]  This is getting really bizarre.
[00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:26.200]  Funny, that that all ties together.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:37.162]  Because I don't know about this letter, I know the Russians are up there spouting off about it on television while building giant bunkers.
[00:34:37.162 --> 00:34:39.903]  Here's why people are so upset about Jade Helm.
[00:34:39.903 --> 00:34:46.024]  They know they're being lied to by the media, the whole Brian Williams syndrome.
[00:34:46.024 --> 00:34:48.885]  They know that their dollars aren't buying what they used to.
[00:34:50.305 --> 00:34:54.207]  They know that the system is becoming authoritarian.
[00:34:54.207 --> 00:35:00.470]  And they can see the screws tightening everywhere.
[00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.272]  And then meanwhile, mainstream media is up there saying everything's fine, go back to sleep.
[00:35:04.272 --> 00:35:07.834]  But kind of in a schizophrenic way, because you can't deny what's happening.
[00:35:07.834 --> 00:35:15.098]  So they'll have articles admitting we're the most militarized country and that we're losing our freedoms, but, oh, look at these kooks, they don't like it.
[00:35:15.098 --> 00:35:16.399]  There's not logic there.
[00:35:16.399 --> 00:35:18.440]  So the system kind of wages war on logic.
[00:35:19.881 --> 00:35:26.410]  I did reports over a decade ago, but six years ago is when the media really attacked over it.
[00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:35.283]  With medical doctors about how BPA and other chemicals were feminizing boys, hyper-feminizing women, making women go into puberty when they were, you know, six, seven years old.
[00:35:37.813 --> 00:35:40.794]  The old average was 14, now it's 10.
[00:35:40.794 --> 00:35:42.974]  Girls as young as 3 are going into puberty.
[00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:45.855]  Breast cancer is up 3000%.
[00:35:45.855 --> 00:36:02.638]  And in mammals, in amphibians, and in aquatic fish, it's accelerating aging, accelerating puberty, confusing the sexes, causing all sorts of disorders.
[00:36:02.638 --> 00:36:04.399]  GMO, BT, corn.
[00:36:05.868 --> 00:36:11.753]  Does this to every rat species, every rodent species, guinea pigs, mice, rats, you name it.
[00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:14.895]  I mean, those studies are legion.
[00:36:14.895 --> 00:36:34.571]  And I'm just sitting here going, hey, this is social engineering written about in Brave New World in 1932 about how they would confuse the sexes first before basically ending the sexes, making us asexual and wiping out our fertility, where you have to go to a fertility clinic where the government takes control and decides what designer baby you're going to get.
[00:36:35.071 --> 00:36:37.712]  Taking control of the entire human development system.
[00:36:37.712 --> 00:36:44.616]  That's now being announced, with sperm counts down in some areas over 95%, on average about 87% worldwide.
[00:36:44.616 --> 00:36:45.756]  It varies, 89%.
[00:36:45.756 --> 00:36:54.180]  That soon, within just 2025 is the headline, most people will have to go have a designer baby made.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:56.341]  But don't worry, insurance will cover it.
[00:36:56.341 --> 00:37:00.844]  Oh, and you may have to add a third parent though, because two won't work anymore under this.
[00:37:00.844 --> 00:37:01.264]  Or a fourth!
[00:37:02.256 --> 00:37:10.140]  So they'll have a designer clone, basically, but then they put some traits in that look like you, claiming it's your kid, it won't even be your child.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:14.642]  It'll gestate inside your wife, and then you'll have your clone.
[00:37:14.642 --> 00:37:16.263]  And people are going, this guy's far out.
[00:37:16.263 --> 00:37:17.644]  That's all over the news.
[00:37:17.644 --> 00:37:27.048]  I told you 20 years ago about humans being grown, humanoids, inside the uteruses of cows for organ harvesting.
[00:37:27.048 --> 00:37:28.089]  It was in the BBC.
[00:37:29.383 --> 00:37:34.285]  And I would have people on the street go, you're a liar, that's not happening.
[00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:47.630]  Now it's all over the news two weeks ago, that yes, they're growing babies inside Unirov cows, but don't worry, they've changed the genetics of the human to be part bovine, so they're not rejected.
[00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.111]  See, like organs are rejected.
[00:37:50.111 --> 00:37:54.913]  So it's not a human, it's a humanoid bovine.
[00:37:54.913 --> 00:37:57.194]  They've got humanoid porcines.
[00:37:57.194 --> 00:37:57.834]  That's a pig.
[00:37:59.462 --> 00:38:02.064]  They're working on humanoid pinnipeds.
[00:38:02.064 --> 00:38:02.764]  Look it up.
[00:38:02.764 --> 00:38:09.509]  That's seals.
[00:38:09.509 --> 00:38:19.197]  And they're talking about if elephants weren't so expensive, they haven't figured out how to create artificial wombs yet, where they could grow people up full-size for bodies?
[00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:22.719]  Humanoid pachyderms.
[00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:24.320]  Look it up!
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:27.843]  You're not in Kansas, baby!
[00:38:27.843 --> 00:38:28.904]  You're in the New World Order.
[00:38:30.916 --> 00:38:38.699]  For over 15 years, China has cows at a factory level producing body parts.
[00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:41.020]  And I don't even know where they're going or what the market is.
[00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.160]  They're just growing them.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.762]  And the cows separately produce milk that's human.
[00:38:47.762 --> 00:38:54.665]  See, the cows are part human and the humanoids are part cow.
[00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.206]  Meanwhile, something that's
[00:38:57.216 --> 00:38:59.719]  Ancient news is finally all over, mainstream news.
[00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:05.585]  Human birth control chemical, BPA, causing lower fertility in fish.
[00:39:05.585 --> 00:39:08.008]  Oh, that's part of why there's problems in the ocean, really?
[00:39:08.008 --> 00:39:08.828]  Oh, well.
[00:39:08.828 --> 00:39:16.577]  I guess the soft kill, getting us, kind of just the blowback, just the ricochets are savaging the giant oceans that cover 76% of the Earth's surface.
[00:39:19.915 --> 00:39:21.116]  Newly released research from U.S.
[00:39:21.116 --> 00:39:25.178]  government scientists found a chemical in birth control pills, and the chemical BPA affects the fertility of fish.
[00:39:25.178 --> 00:39:28.080]  These chemicals often end up in the waterways.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:36.945]  And then, suddenly, the genitals start shrinking, the fertility starts shrinking, and suddenly, they know people are going to be confused sexually, so it's everywhere going, put in the new bathrooms!
[00:39:36.945 --> 00:39:47.931]  Accept the fact that we're going to have men that are women, women that are men, and all these new genders, and people that are gender neutral, and Facebook has 50 different sexual genders now.
[00:39:49.161 --> 00:39:52.582]  When all it is is chemically attacked folks dying.
[00:39:52.582 --> 00:39:56.403]  But, oh, see, I'm homophobic about the fish.
[00:39:56.403 --> 00:39:59.464]  No, folks, I'm giving you science.
[00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:05.806]  Cut out all of the moralizing about gay, lesbian, blah, blah, blah, all of this.
[00:40:05.806 --> 00:40:07.526]  I care about all these people.
[00:40:07.526 --> 00:40:09.087]  I don't obsess over these issues.
[00:40:09.087 --> 00:40:10.127]  Everybody knows that.
[00:40:10.127 --> 00:40:14.128]  I'm telling you what happened here.
[00:40:14.128 --> 00:40:16.929]  I'm like Charlton Heston at the end of Omega Man.
[00:40:17.947 --> 00:40:22.068]  Which is a remake of The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price, both excellent films.
[00:40:22.068 --> 00:40:29.151]  And he's got the cure for the virus that basically turns people into undead vampires.
[00:40:29.151 --> 00:40:32.472]  And he's there, and they go, buddy, we don't want to change!
[00:40:32.472 --> 00:40:34.353]  And they throw a spear into him and kill him.
[00:40:34.353 --> 00:40:36.593]  In fact, can you check on YouTube?
[00:40:36.593 --> 00:40:38.114]  End scene of Omega Man?
[00:40:38.114 --> 00:40:40.115]  I mean, I'm here...
[00:40:41.118 --> 00:40:42.880]  I'm not showing you where the White House science are.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.842]  I wrote about this in the 70s.
[00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:45.883]  I'm showing you the proof.
[00:40:45.883 --> 00:40:47.245]  I made films on it.
[00:40:47.245 --> 00:40:48.046]  How they're doing it.
[00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:53.712]  In fact, Google Pentagon planned gay bomb.
[00:40:53.712 --> 00:40:57.797]  They've got chemical hormone sprays that they can spray on a man.
[00:40:58.832 --> 00:41:09.254]  And you immediately begin releasing chemicals in your brain where the smell of men through your olfactory nerve makes it uncontrollable that you want to jump on top of them like they're Marilyn Monroe.
[00:41:09.254 --> 00:41:10.694]  There it is, BBC.
[00:41:10.694 --> 00:41:10.954]  U.S.
[00:41:10.954 --> 00:41:13.175]  military pondered love, not war.
[00:41:13.175 --> 00:41:13.335]  U.S.
[00:41:13.335 --> 00:41:20.556]  military investigated building a gay bomb, which would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other.
[00:41:20.556 --> 00:41:25.797]  In rodent studies, within one day the rats even stopped eating and just began fornicating immediately.
[00:41:28.888 --> 00:41:33.611]  You want to understand, we've been hit by a confusion weapon, a stun weapon.
[00:41:33.611 --> 00:41:35.172]  And they don't want it to be too obvious.
[00:41:35.172 --> 00:41:38.274]  They've been testing a whole bunch of different systems.
[00:41:38.274 --> 00:41:44.399]  Positronic, electronic, waves, chemical, radiological, biological.
[00:41:44.399 --> 00:41:46.200]  They've already put viruses in the population.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:52.724]  They've been testing them on troops that actually destroy parts of the brain, reprogramming.
[00:41:52.724 --> 00:41:53.665]  All of this is going on.
[00:41:55.799 --> 00:42:01.565]  They've got viruses that will go in and take out inhibitor areas of the brain where you will be like born super soldiers.
[00:42:01.565 --> 00:42:10.374]  You notice I told you about this 15 years ago and two years ago the new Born movie came out where they use viruses to reprogram the brain.
[00:42:10.374 --> 00:42:12.817]  The difference is though you wouldn't be controlled on that.
[00:42:13.951 --> 00:42:25.281]  That's why they're talking about a processor chip along with it, with the new biological android, which they'll take soldiers and turn into, because they can't grow them fast enough in cows, and then raise them, and they're having too many problems.
[00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:34.009]  But down the road, they won't need to take soldiers, put them in secret programs, brain chip them, test virals on them, and of course, not everybody turns into a super soldier.
[00:42:34.009 --> 00:42:36.271]  A lot of them end up getting really screwed up by all this.
[00:42:36.992 --> 00:42:38.153]  Oh yeah, the movie's basically real.
[00:42:38.153 --> 00:42:39.614]  It's just throwing in your face what's happening.
[00:42:39.614 --> 00:42:52.926]  So that when they openly announce this down the road that you can be a candidate for it and go volunteer, then it can be like the new celebrity that, oh, my husband or my neighbor or, you know, my dad, you know, volunteered to be enhanced.
[00:42:52.926 --> 00:43:00.733]  And they were enhancing soldiers in the 80s with cyborg components internally.
[00:43:03.044 --> 00:43:04.444]  In Maryland.
[00:43:04.444 --> 00:43:07.325]  That's all I know, and that's the one case we know about.
[00:43:07.325 --> 00:43:16.028]  They tried to hire my dad, again, not... They tried to hire a bunch of dentists in Dallas who were implant doctors, and he was a pioneer in implants and oral surgery.
[00:43:16.028 --> 00:43:21.870]  One of the first people to do implants and actually do them on patients, not just at the university where he worked.
[00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:26.472]  And he treated CIA people and other stuff like that.
[00:43:26.472 --> 00:43:27.492]  He's letting me tell the story.
[00:43:27.492 --> 00:43:29.292]  He actually doesn't like me telling it, but he says, fine, go ahead and tell it.
[00:43:31.374 --> 00:43:34.715]  Then they tried to recruit him and offered him like double the money to move to Maryland.
[00:43:34.715 --> 00:43:37.157]  I remember the whole discussion at the dinner table.
[00:43:37.157 --> 00:43:38.977]  My mother saying, I'm not leaving Texas.
[00:43:38.977 --> 00:43:41.118]  I don't want to be in, you know, some secret government program.
[00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:42.879]  And he didn't tell me any of the details.
[00:43:42.879 --> 00:43:49.202]  It was just, he was going to be working on spies and special ops putting stuff in them.
[00:43:51.257 --> 00:44:08.124]  And obviously you can imagine hiding stuff in somebody's jaw, you know, fake teeth, but it goes well beyond, well beyond all that, because they were telling him, no, we're going to put you into some advanced surgery medical courses, and then this is not just going to be in the jaw and in the mouth where his degrees are.
[00:44:08.124 --> 00:44:12.466]  I mean, you understand we're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:12.466 --> 00:44:14.266]  We weren't in Kansas in 1982.
[00:44:23.387 --> 00:44:43.076]  I mean, before they have the Daily Show, or MSNBC got up there with Rachel Maddow, Rachel, it's okay you got hit with chemicals in utero, and I'm not against you, and I'm not saying you're bad, I know you have the brain of a man, I understand that, it's okay.
[00:44:43.076 --> 00:44:45.658]  So you're attracted to women, I understand that.
[00:44:45.658 --> 00:44:50.740]  The issue is, I don't hate you, I don't hate the fish that this is happening to.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.681]  This is being done to us, you understand that.
[00:44:55.762 --> 00:45:00.465]  But see, instead they want to embrace the system and basically go with it.
[00:45:00.465 --> 00:45:02.386]  I think we have Omega Man on DVD somewhere.
[00:45:02.386 --> 00:45:04.207]  Did you guys find that?
[00:45:04.207 --> 00:45:06.028]  Is that on YouTube?
[00:45:06.028 --> 00:45:07.368]  It is on YouTube?
[00:45:07.368 --> 00:45:08.109]  It's on YouTube.
[00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:09.229]  I'm going through the video now.
[00:45:09.229 --> 00:45:12.251]  I'm not at the correct spot yet.
[00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:12.851]  Just go to the end.
[00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:13.151]  Thank you.
[00:45:13.151 --> 00:45:17.254]  You're the best.
[00:45:17.254 --> 00:45:18.554]  Or you can do the Vincent Price one.
[00:45:18.554 --> 00:45:23.417]  I think he actually goes there in that one just to kill everybody.
[00:45:30.233 --> 00:45:34.837]  You know, if anybody gets anything from this show, I just want you to understand this.
[00:45:34.837 --> 00:45:42.043]  We are living in a fantastic science fiction movie, and there is so much good in the world, there's also so much bad.
[00:45:42.043 --> 00:45:44.545]  I mean, I was out in California.
[00:45:44.545 --> 00:45:49.149]  Talk about a tale of two cities, best of times, worst of times.
[00:45:49.149 --> 00:45:53.153]  I was in Orange County, which is heaven compared to Los Angeles.
[00:45:53.153 --> 00:45:56.596]  I love Northern California, love Central California.
[00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:59.130]  Love Southern California.
[00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:03.193]  I mean, it was so beautiful on the coast.
[00:46:03.193 --> 00:46:06.635]  And the people are in La La Land because it's so nice.
[00:46:06.635 --> 00:46:14.540]  And that's where the parasites have all gone, you know, the socialists, the globalists, the rest of it, to milk the system because it is so beautiful.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:19.163]  Austin, compared to most of Texas, is very beautiful and very nice, so they're all coming here.
[00:46:19.163 --> 00:46:23.026]  But it's the best of times, worst of times.
[00:46:23.026 --> 00:46:24.867]  And I just look at families at the beach
[00:46:26.195 --> 00:46:40.260]  Realizing that they're being targeted, they're being hit by this, and that poor people don't know how to avoid the fluoride, don't know how to avoid the GMO, and that's why they're having such horrible health problems and such low IQs.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.761]  I don't care if you're black or white or Hispanic.
[00:46:42.827 --> 00:46:44.948]  And I was thinking just that very thing this weekend.
[00:46:44.948 --> 00:46:46.790]  I just wanted to warn everybody.
[00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:54.915]  And I want to warn poor people, but they don't have the money, the way the economy's been basically algorithmed, to even get the food and the clean water they need.
[00:46:54.915 --> 00:47:01.579]  I mean, none of the yuppies, liberal, conservative out there, and I was talking to some, none of them drink tap water.
[00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:03.120]  None of them eat GMO.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.520]  None of them.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:10.365]  They are aware of what's going on, and they look good, they're smart, but they're self-centered and just into enjoying
[00:47:11.681 --> 00:47:15.982]  The level that they're at, but it's like a rising ocean of poison.
[00:47:15.982 --> 00:47:22.703]  They're never going to escape it just being above it, because it's designed to take everybody out in the end.
[00:47:22.703 --> 00:47:28.104]  Study reveals sad link between poverty and children's brain development.
[00:47:28.104 --> 00:47:30.385]  That's out of the Huffington Post.
[00:47:30.385 --> 00:47:36.106]  But see, the answer is give more government funding, not why are they so unhealthy.
[00:47:36.974 --> 00:47:40.195]  I mean, Michelle Obama doesn't say don't eat GMO.
[00:47:40.195 --> 00:47:42.756]  She just says eat less calories.
[00:47:42.756 --> 00:47:46.698]  She doesn't say don't eat aspartame or all this other garbage.
[00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:49.279]  MSG, she just says, no, no, no, eat your MSG.
[00:47:49.279 --> 00:47:52.380]  Just eat less calories.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.222]  Pesticides on fruits, veggies linked with poor semen quality.
[00:47:56.222 --> 00:47:57.742]  Reuters.
[00:47:57.742 --> 00:47:58.303]  See?
[00:47:58.303 --> 00:48:02.984]  This is just in the news today.
[00:48:02.984 --> 00:48:06.286]  And then you read all these books written by the former head of UNESCO,
[00:48:07.682 --> 00:48:15.464]  Julian Huxley, Aldous Huxley's brother, Aldous is over here writing fiction, and then Julian's over at the U.N.
[00:48:15.464 --> 00:48:18.365]  actually doing it.
[00:48:18.365 --> 00:48:20.646]  In the 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, you know, he was in the U.N.
[00:48:20.646 --> 00:48:21.506]  in the 50s, 60s.
[00:48:21.506 --> 00:48:25.287]  They were writing books in the 30s about the plan, and guess what?
[00:48:25.287 --> 00:48:26.687]  They've done it.
[00:48:26.687 --> 00:48:28.648]  And now it's about to get real bad.
[00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:32.850]  In the social engineering, where it gets incredibly obvious what's going on.
[00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.171]  And you're going to have EAS alerts on your TV.
[00:48:36.171 --> 00:48:39.732]  It'll be every month, then every week, then every day, then every hour.
[00:48:39.732 --> 00:48:45.193]  Then you're going to have government announcements breaking in over radio, TV, internet, over your phone.
[00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:46.794]  It's going to all be force-fed.
[00:48:46.794 --> 00:48:50.155]  You're now seeing that start.
[00:48:50.155 --> 00:48:52.936]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:52.936 --> 00:48:54.376]  This is the conditioning.
[00:48:54.376 --> 00:48:56.517]  See, the takeover isn't Jade Helm.
[00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:57.537]  Jade Helm is only
[00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:03.574]  One more tick on the clock as it races up to midnight.
[00:49:03.574 --> 00:49:07.597]  But we're already in an increment of martial law, in an increment.
[00:49:07.597 --> 00:49:10.740]  But it's selective.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:19.887]  I was in the LAX airport yesterday, and if you waive your rights and go through this, turn your right to travel into a privilege, and do the smart check, then they might not search you.
[00:49:19.887 --> 00:49:25.071]  But I watched them still searching people that did the, did the, you know, pre-check.
[00:49:25.071 --> 00:49:27.493]  And then people are pulling their shoes off, and they were spraying
[00:49:29.195 --> 00:49:49.220]  Toxic air freshener in there with stinking feet and to sit there and watch people walk through the aisles and just all of it an unsanitary joke and then searching everyone and body scanning everyone everyone putting their hands up in the act of submission saying I'm a criminal and now police are announcing whenever we pull anybody over we just want you to get out put your hands up.
[00:49:51.135 --> 00:49:59.526]  Yeah, leave the borders open, release hundreds of thousands of armed felons, let them go free, but everybody else will be a criminal because we don't profile.
[00:49:59.526 --> 00:50:03.370]  Everyone has the right to be a slave.
[00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.032]  You understand?
[00:50:05.032 --> 00:50:08.357]  This is the journey to slavery, and then they have the Washington Post.
[00:50:10.151 --> 00:50:19.673]  And every other publication in the country, I mean LA Times, Washington Post, New York Times, Dallas Morning News, you name it, all saying don't freak out about Jade Helm, everything's fine.
[00:50:19.673 --> 00:50:21.753]  This is not going to be martial law this summer.
[00:50:21.753 --> 00:50:23.194]  Alex Jones is wrong.
[00:50:23.194 --> 00:50:23.774]  He's a kook.
[00:50:23.774 --> 00:50:26.814]  Yeah, because I never said there'd be martial law this summer from the start.
[00:50:26.814 --> 00:50:32.276]  You build a straw man.
[00:50:32.276 --> 00:50:36.437]  Preying on your viewers and your readers, because you're predators.
[00:50:36.437 --> 00:50:38.197]  But you're being preyed on as well.
[00:50:39.113 --> 00:50:44.076]  And you think you're powerful because you've gone along with the system.
[00:50:44.076 --> 00:50:49.760]  So when we come back, the latest on Jade Helm.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.681]  The latest on the economy.
[00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:52.582]  We're gonna get into Russia.
[00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:55.864]  Analyst calls for nuclear attack on Yellowstone National Park.
[00:50:55.864 --> 00:50:57.225]  Can't make that up.
[00:50:57.225 --> 00:50:57.886]  It's all coming up.
[00:50:57.886 --> 00:50:58.286]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.113 --> 00:51:02.734]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[00:51:02.734 --> 00:51:07.335]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?
[00:51:07.335 --> 00:51:09.035]  Get our 10 Reasons book free.
[00:51:09.035 --> 00:51:09.275]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:09.515]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.241]  It's happening again.
[00:51:30.241 --> 00:51:33.864]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[00:51:33.864 --> 00:51:37.267]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[00:51:37.267 --> 00:51:41.330]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.
[00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:46.834]  Katie Armor offers the most affordable level 3 body armor packages on the market today.
[00:51:46.834 --> 00:51:47.955]  Protect yourself.
[00:51:47.955 --> 00:51:50.937]  Buy your body armor now, before it's too late.
[00:51:50.937 --> 00:51:52.739]  Go to katiarmor.com.
[00:51:52.739 --> 00:51:55.721]  That's K-A-T-I-A-R-M-O-R.com.
[00:51:55.721 --> 00:51:56.782]  Come and take it.
[00:51:58.339 --> 00:51:59.300]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:51:59.860]  Good, brother.
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.821]  Just recently started using your products.
[00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:03.543]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:52:03.543 --> 00:52:07.565]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:52:07.565 --> 00:52:10.187]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[00:52:10.187 --> 00:52:12.609]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:20.594]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:52:20.814 --> 00:52:24.018]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[00:52:24.018 --> 00:52:25.560]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:30.245]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, saving a ton of money there.
[00:52:30.245 --> 00:52:35.671]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated
[00:52:35.731 --> 00:52:36.431]  We're good to go.
[00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:00.091]  It's very easy to be a criminal.
[00:53:00.091 --> 00:53:03.732]  All you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool.
[00:53:03.732 --> 00:53:05.073]  A pair of scissors.
[00:53:05.073 --> 00:53:10.876]  If your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors, then you're making it easy for them.
[00:53:10.876 --> 00:53:15.798]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big-name companies, has a weakness.
[00:53:15.798 --> 00:53:16.778]  The phone line.
[00:53:16.778 --> 00:53:22.040]  You shell out $1,500, get locked into a long-term contract, and think you're safe.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.782]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip.
[00:53:25.942 --> 00:53:29.246]  And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[00:54:02.175 --> 00:54:04.096]  The mission is not impossible.
[00:54:04.096 --> 00:54:06.498]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:06.498 --> 00:54:09.220]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:54:11.693 --> 00:54:20.716]  If we can identify the globalist master blueprint plan to destabilize humanity and bring in a technocracy, we can stop them.
[00:54:20.716 --> 00:54:23.958]  If we can get the true narrative out to the population.
[00:54:23.958 --> 00:54:34.261]  The general public is mesmerized by entertainment, mesmerized by disinformation, and is in a stunned, chemical state.
[00:54:34.261 --> 00:54:40.904]  But if you reach someone and they're aware of the propaganda, they can be basically broken out of it.
[00:54:43.772 --> 00:54:54.475]  And where we really see the unified propaganda is in television, where they show a hero cop who helps everybody, but he goes psycho, he tortures people to get the bad guys, but then the end justifies the means.
[00:54:54.475 --> 00:54:59.416]  Shows like Chicago PD.
[00:54:59.416 --> 00:55:08.138]  And in the primitive narrative of the mind, you did the bad thing, but it ended up being for a good cause, so now it's okay, but now it's been sold to the system to do it in general.
[00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:11.559]  And then Chicago actually has black sites torturing and killing people,
[00:55:12.346 --> 00:55:14.427]  But it's okay because it's bad guys.
[00:55:14.427 --> 00:55:18.628]  You've now converted over to North Korea or to Mexico.
[00:55:18.628 --> 00:55:23.230]  This is how the Injustifies the Means leads you to this tyranny.
[00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:27.812]  Now, going back to the Omega Man, he's a scientist, microbiologist.
[00:55:27.812 --> 00:55:32.773]  He discovers, Charlton Heston movie, a remake of The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price.
[00:55:32.773 --> 00:55:36.455]  He discovers the cure is actually an antibody in his blood.
[00:55:36.455 --> 00:55:39.836]  That's why he didn't turn into one of the, you know, basically zombie killers.
[00:55:41.092 --> 00:55:43.953]  They're not even zombies, they still have their intelligence.
[00:55:43.953 --> 00:55:57.300]  Is because... Is because... He can basically give them the serum and cure them, but they don't want it.
[00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.220]  They end up killing him.
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.121]  They don't want the truth.
[00:56:00.121 --> 00:56:02.342]  They've gone too far down the road.
[00:56:02.342 --> 00:56:05.744]  They're now part of the system.
[00:56:05.744 --> 00:56:07.305]  Now we can sleep in peace.
[00:56:12.682 --> 00:56:14.664]  Now they can sleep in peace.
[00:56:14.664 --> 00:56:15.704]  They live, we sleep.
[00:56:15.704 --> 00:56:21.068]  Robert, you're evil.
[00:56:21.068 --> 00:56:23.510]  I'm part of a family, Robert.
[00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:27.813]  I'm sorry.
[00:56:27.813 --> 00:56:30.395]  Of course, this is all a Christ allegory.
[00:56:30.395 --> 00:56:36.060]  Because his gun jams, he can't stop, he's trying to save her.
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:37.641]  He was about to give her the serum.
[00:56:38.968 --> 00:56:39.888]  But it's too late.
[00:56:39.888 --> 00:56:42.809]  But then, basically, a few people survived.
[00:56:42.809 --> 00:56:44.450]  They get some of his blood.
[00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:53.933]  Some of the other scientists figure it out and are able to, hopefully, start a new beginning by curing the folks that have the virus.
[00:56:53.933 --> 00:57:01.875]  And it's all an allegory of what's really going on.
[00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.196]  Alright, that's it on that subject.
[00:57:04.952 --> 00:57:07.073]  I'm telling you folks, it's pure evil.
[00:57:07.073 --> 00:57:13.455]  I mean, they're putting stuff in the water on purpose and bragging about it to screw up your sexuality.
[00:57:13.455 --> 00:57:19.118]  Notice they now tell you being heterosexual is bad, see?
[00:57:19.118 --> 00:57:20.638]  That's because having children is bad.
[00:57:20.638 --> 00:57:21.779]  It's because living is bad.
[00:57:21.779 --> 00:57:25.340]  They're building a world not for people.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:27.341]  They're not sending astronauts to space anymore.
[00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:28.241]  That's the plan.
[00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:30.542]  They're not building planes that humans pilot anymore.
[00:57:30.542 --> 00:57:31.983]  They're handing us over to the machines.
[00:57:33.564 --> 00:57:34.685]  Ray Kurzweil.
[00:57:34.685 --> 00:57:36.906]  Bill Joy.
[00:57:36.906 --> 00:57:38.647]  Wozniak.
[00:57:38.647 --> 00:57:39.708]  One of the founders of Apple.
[00:57:39.708 --> 00:57:41.809]  He said the machines are going to kill everybody.
[00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:44.470]  We're building a world without humans.
[00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:45.731]  I didn't originate all this.
[00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:47.132]  The decision's been made!
[00:57:47.132 --> 00:57:53.536]  And the Washington Post idiots sit there making fun of me like it's okay.
[00:57:53.536 --> 00:57:54.476]  Do you get it?
[00:57:54.476 --> 00:57:56.918]  You and your family are targeted, jackass!
[00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:06.132]  But people just want to feel like they're winners, so they just side with the power structure because it pats them on the head.
[00:58:06.132 --> 00:58:08.333]  Okay!
[00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:10.875]  By the way, folks, I'm out of town.
[00:58:10.875 --> 00:58:13.256]  We need to fund our operation when I leave town, obviously.
[00:58:14.923 --> 00:58:18.646]  We don't focus so much on promotion.
[00:58:18.646 --> 00:58:20.887]  I tend to not do it either because I'm so focused on the information.
[00:58:20.887 --> 00:58:22.148]  You need to fund our operation.

[00:58:55.144 --> 00:58:55.984]  Security alert.
[00:58:55.984 --> 00:58:57.205]  Security alert.
[00:58:57.205 --> 00:58:59.206]  This is Homeland Security.

[00:59:16.476 --> 00:59:18.637]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[00:59:18.937 --> 00:59:20.278]  These people are assaulting us.
[00:59:20.278 --> 00:59:23.140]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.061]  They're never going to stop.
[00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:29.104]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:43.773]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[00:59:43.773 --> 00:59:45.154]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[00:59:45.154 --> 00:59:45.914]  You can feel it.
[00:59:51.459 --> 00:59:54.063]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:06.369]  Big Brother.

[01:00:11.471 --> 01:00:13.031]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.031 --> 01:00:17.192]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.192 --> 01:00:22.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:25.755]  We could be seeing the beginning of the fall of the Clinton dynasty.
[01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:29.916]  The House wants to see Hillary Clinton under oath.
[01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:31.836]  She clearly has been caught committing major felonies.
[01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:33.217]  We're going to be talking about that some.
[01:00:35.254 --> 01:00:37.416]  More on the big Iran talks.
[01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.137]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:00:39.137 --> 01:00:40.077]  Start of the next segment.
[01:00:40.077 --> 01:00:41.918]  I want to get to some other news right now.
[01:00:41.918 --> 01:00:44.760]  Russian analyst calls for nuclear attack on Yellowstone.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.603]  I'll tell you, I'll be out of Austin for four days.
[01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:49.403]  My allergies went away.
[01:00:49.403 --> 01:00:51.204]  They're certainly back.
[01:00:51.204 --> 01:00:55.047]  Russian analyst calls for nuclear attack on Yellowstone National Park.
[01:00:55.047 --> 01:00:59.130]  The consequences will be catastrophic for the United States.
[01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:02.312]  The next generation of weapons that Russia will use against the United States in World War III.
[01:01:04.005 --> 01:01:09.007]  The Russian military is in the midst of a sweeping modernization program.
[01:01:09.007 --> 01:01:11.588]  That is just some of what we're going to be breaking down.
[01:01:11.588 --> 01:01:17.151]  Also, they covered this yesterday, but I want to get back into it as it ties in.
[01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:26.935]  Video shows troops training to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale and how that ties into Jade Helm and the big EAS alerts.
[01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:30.462]  That have been horrifying the public.
[01:01:30.462 --> 01:01:31.403]  What's wrong?
[01:01:31.403 --> 01:01:33.524]  No one else is horrified.
[01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:35.465]  Everyone loves what's happening.
[01:01:35.465 --> 01:01:37.386]  No one's worried.
[01:01:37.386 --> 01:01:40.287]  Everything's okay.
[01:01:40.287 --> 01:01:41.948]  Everything's fine.
[01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.550]  Go back to sleep.
[01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:52.314]  And while I'm reading this EAS article, we'll roll some of that B-roll for TV viewers of the footage shot in Florida.
[01:01:54.438 --> 01:02:01.470]  of the military training with helicopters to round up citizens and put them in white vans.
[01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:05.316]  Nationwide emergency alert test causes panic, confusion.
[01:02:05.316 --> 01:02:08.541]  TV viewers across America see unexpected message.
[01:02:09.895 --> 01:02:19.558]  The test of the National Emergency Alert System which has been seen by television viewers this morning and states across the country prompted panic and confusion with many taking to Twitter to express their concerns.
[01:02:19.558 --> 01:02:29.441]  Don't be concerned about the troops and the drills and the checkpoints and the cameras and the TSA and the naked body scanners and the NSA spying and the bank saying it's illegal to withdraw $5,000 even though it's not.
[01:02:29.441 --> 01:02:33.022]  Just don't worry about Obama announcing executive power grabs on the border and everything else.
[01:02:33.022 --> 01:02:33.562]  It's all normal.
[01:02:34.773 --> 01:02:35.393]  It's all normal.
[01:02:35.393 --> 01:02:36.474]  Go back to sleep.
[01:02:36.474 --> 01:02:37.114]  Move along.
[01:02:37.114 --> 01:02:37.754]  Move along.
[01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:38.515]  We love you.
[01:02:38.515 --> 01:02:39.915]  Liberal, liberal, liberal.
[01:02:39.915 --> 01:02:40.696]  Don't be racist.
[01:02:40.696 --> 01:02:41.816]  Don't be homophobe.
[01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:42.617]  Turn in your guns.
[01:02:42.617 --> 01:02:43.337]  Submit.
[01:02:43.337 --> 01:02:44.558]  Drink the fluoride.
[01:02:44.558 --> 01:02:45.638]  Take the vaccine.
[01:02:45.638 --> 01:02:47.079]  Ooh, see?
[01:02:47.079 --> 01:02:48.440]  No more pain now.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.261]  No more thinking now.
[01:02:50.261 --> 01:02:51.761]  Oh, yes.
[01:02:51.761 --> 01:02:53.082]  Families are bad.
[01:02:53.082 --> 01:02:53.942]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:53.942 --> 01:02:55.363]  We want to help you with the government.
[01:02:55.363 --> 01:02:56.363]  Oh, we're so sweet.
[01:02:56.363 --> 01:02:57.704]  The test began around 11 a.m.
[01:02:57.704 --> 01:02:57.764]  EST.
[01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:07.673]  And what is broadcast in Washington D.C., Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia.
[01:03:07.673 --> 01:03:13.780]  The emergency alert contained no details and merely listed the states in effect and said the alert would run from 11 a.m.
[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.121]  to 12 midnight.
[01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:24.896]  So see, they took over for an hour now, that's what panicked them, is they're training you, it's not 30 seconds now, and then it's not a minute, it's not five.
[01:03:24.896 --> 01:03:39.027]  Now it's an hour, and see, now there's going to be announcements, and dear leader, remember even mainstream news, two years after we told you, five years ago, admitted, oh, there is a government kill switch, it was called an Obama kill switch, where if they can take over,
[01:03:39.747 --> 01:03:46.691]  But only for the flu or other emergency and all channels will give you the government message.
[01:03:46.691 --> 01:03:50.993]  Yay!
[01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.315]  The Obama kill switch.
[01:03:53.315 --> 01:03:54.575]  What's wrong with that?
[01:03:54.575 --> 01:03:58.217]  It's liberal.
[01:03:58.217 --> 01:03:59.338]  The test began around 11 a.m.
[01:03:59.338 --> 01:03:59.438]  EST.
[01:04:01.798 --> 01:04:08.663]  And was broadcast in Washington, D.C., Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.
[01:04:08.663 --> 01:04:13.706]  The emergency alert contained no details and merely listed the states it affected and said the alert would run from 11 a.m.
[01:04:13.706 --> 01:04:16.448]  to 12 midnight.
[01:04:16.448 --> 01:04:17.569]  Just setting their will.
[01:04:17.569 --> 01:04:28.116]  And again, they came to the Texas Association of Broadcasters 18 years ago and told the head engineers on the panel that this would be coming.
[01:04:28.116 --> 01:04:29.857]  And it took a long time, but now they're getting ready to do it, see?
[01:04:30.759 --> 01:04:44.002]  I made a film about it, by the way, called Police 82,000, where I show all the documents and show the EAS, and they actually found out which engineer in this freak country had given me the information, and he managed 10 radio stations, and they basically took his contract away.
[01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:47.643]  The Texas Association of Authoritarian Broadcasters.
[01:04:47.643 --> 01:04:51.524]  Viewers in Sacramento, California, also reported seeing the test.
[01:04:51.524 --> 01:04:52.624]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:04:52.624 --> 01:04:55.525]  So they commandeered now for an hour, not 30 seconds.
[01:04:55.525 --> 01:04:56.645]  Getting ready for something, huh?
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:04.062]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:05:04.062 --> 01:05:10.184]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:05:10.184 --> 01:05:14.965]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:05:14.965 --> 01:05:18.547]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.

[01:06:53.263 --> 01:06:53.603]  Silver Bullet.
[01:06:58.662 --> 01:07:00.624]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[01:07:00.624 --> 01:07:04.867]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:07:04.867 --> 01:07:09.331]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[01:07:09.331 --> 01:07:16.077]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[01:07:16.617 --> 01:07:25.908]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:31.314]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds.

[01:08:01.138 --> 01:08:01.938]  What's his name?
[01:08:01.938 --> 01:08:04.900]  This is an emergency transmission.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:13.203]  This is an emergency transmission.
[01:08:13.203 --> 01:08:16.965]  From FEMA Region 6 in Pocono.
[01:08:23.544 --> 01:08:25.245]  There is a war.
[01:08:25.245 --> 01:08:27.066]  It's happening now.
[01:08:27.066 --> 01:08:29.468]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:08:29.468 --> 01:08:32.069]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:33.970]  We are the resistance.
[01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:37.152]  We are the Infowar.
[01:08:37.152 --> 01:08:38.933]  We are the resistance!
[01:08:38.933 --> 01:08:48.099]  You are the resistance to the anti-human, anti-family, anti-love, globalist, technocratic takeover that is happening globally.
[01:08:51.223 --> 01:08:53.285]  The story's up on DrugsReport.com.
[01:08:53.285 --> 01:08:54.205]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:08:54.205 --> 01:08:57.208]  Now, well into the second hour.
[01:08:57.208 --> 01:09:06.235]  Nationwide emergency alert test causes panic and confusion from the East Coast to the West Coast for an hour.
[01:09:06.235 --> 01:09:15.283]  All televisions, cable broadcast, was taken over with emergency alert system.
[01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:18.211]  And they've been ratcheting it up.
[01:09:18.211 --> 01:09:24.143]  I told you just six months ago, the last time they took over for like 15 minutes, I said next it will be an hour.
[01:09:24.143 --> 01:09:26.347]  And I did get it dead on.
[01:09:26.347 --> 01:09:28.231]  Because I understand they're titrating.
[01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:29.857]  They're conditioning.
[01:09:29.857 --> 01:09:31.598]  It's a psychological warfare tactic.
[01:09:31.598 --> 01:09:32.959]  We're being prepared.
[01:09:32.959 --> 01:09:34.060]  Will it come this summer?
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:34.760]  I don't know.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.701]  Will it come in a year?
[01:09:35.701 --> 01:09:36.622]  I don't know.
[01:09:36.622 --> 01:09:41.686]  But all over the world, the rhetoric has never been more vicious for nuclear war.
[01:09:41.686 --> 01:09:43.127]  That's not Alex Jones saying that.
[01:09:43.127 --> 01:09:44.148]  That's mainline analysts.
[01:09:44.148 --> 01:09:46.629]  And you've got General Scales on Fox News.
[01:09:46.629 --> 01:09:49.692]  They're analysts saying it's time to start killing a bunch of Russians.
[01:09:49.692 --> 01:09:53.134]  And it's time to basically, you know, send them home in body bags.
[01:09:53.134 --> 01:09:57.618]  As they send in brigades of NATO armor to engage in the east of Ukraine.
[01:09:58.949 --> 01:10:00.508]  Unprecedented!
[01:10:03.883 --> 01:10:05.704]  Game, set and match in the Ukraine.
[01:10:05.704 --> 01:10:12.207]  The only way the United States can have any effect in this region and turn the tide is to start killing Russians.
[01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:20.931]  Killing Russians by killing so many Russians that even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are returning to the motherland in body bags.
[01:10:20.931 --> 01:10:33.216]  But given the amount of support we've given the Ukrainians, given the ability of the Ukrainians themselves to counterattack against these, what, 12,000 Russians camped in their country, sadly that's not likely to happen.
[01:10:33.436 --> 01:10:35.116]  In their country.
[01:10:35.116 --> 01:10:38.217]  When Eastern Ukraine has been part of Russia for 400, 500 years.
[01:10:38.217 --> 01:10:40.277]  Depending on how you look at it.
[01:10:40.277 --> 01:10:44.618]  They've had, depending on how you look at it, six or seven major wars.
[01:10:44.618 --> 01:10:51.640]  More than 15, 20 if you count minor ones over the region.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.581]  And then they had other wars with Muslims invading the area.
[01:10:54.581 --> 01:10:56.341]  I mean this area is a war zone.
[01:11:00.373 --> 01:11:02.934]  And I'm not, again, lionizing the Russians.
[01:11:02.934 --> 01:11:08.498]  The point is, we're in their backyard, on their back door, and there are U.S.
[01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:14.661]  troops who have been caught on video there fighting them.
[01:11:14.661 --> 01:11:16.322]  And mercenaries.
[01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:26.768]  And billions of dollars pumped in there, and now Russia... By the way, a week before General Scales said that, just to show how his whole narrative is a fraud, Putin came out on state-run media,
[01:11:28.604 --> 01:11:31.566]  And said, yeah, we have nuclear weapons in place ready to use them.
[01:11:31.566 --> 01:11:36.790]  And yes, we now have Russian troops there.
[01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:47.477]  So they've escalated to the point that was right when NATO came out and said we're sending in a brigade of armor in just one announcement.
[01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:52.120]  With NATO soldiers in them.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.982]  Probably US, that's the main contingent.
[01:11:54.982 --> 01:11:58.104]  And Russia said, okay, the nukes are rolled in and yeah, we got troops there.
[01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:02.714]  This is beyond the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:12:02.714 --> 01:12:09.484]  And they're getting the EAS takeover system ready.
[01:12:09.484 --> 01:12:13.530]  Two trannies attacked yesterday the NSA base.
[01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.451]  I haven't even gotten to that.
[01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:16.094]  I mean, we're living in the Twilight Zone.
[01:12:19.428 --> 01:12:20.669]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:23.512]  Just these headlines are like from Mars.
[01:12:23.512 --> 01:12:26.795]  Two transvestites ram their car in and attack.
[01:12:26.795 --> 01:12:37.146]  I mean, this is just becoming total outer limits meets 1984 meets Bizarro Land meets MTV.
[01:12:44.738 --> 01:12:46.259]  You don't have a right not to be spied on.
[01:12:46.259 --> 01:12:49.680]  You don't have a right to have the IRS take your bank account without a warrant or an indictment.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.321]  You don't have a right to not have chemicals in your food.
[01:12:53.321 --> 01:13:00.803]  But the Justice Department is suing colleges around the country if they don't accept people that want to be professors that are transgendered.
[01:13:00.803 --> 01:13:05.425]  And it's not like they're... See, that's the new litmus test.
[01:13:05.425 --> 01:13:09.727]  That's the new political correctness to the next level.
[01:13:09.727 --> 01:13:12.648]  The new means testing.
[01:13:12.648 --> 01:13:13.668]  The new affirmative action.
[01:13:16.056 --> 01:13:20.958]  Is you're going to have special bathrooms for people.
[01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:23.459]  And again, it's a football issue.
[01:13:23.459 --> 01:13:24.839]  It doesn't even mean anything.
[01:13:24.839 --> 01:13:37.304]  It's just it's just so crazy that we're on the verge of open war with Russia and the Pentagon is revisiting whether they should have put transvestites into the and trannies into the military.
[01:13:37.304 --> 01:13:42.646]  Yes, so they can do their nails and boot camp.
[01:13:42.646 --> 01:13:43.727]  I mean, I mean, imagine somebody 20 years
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:50.643]  Yes, there'll be trannies in the military when we're about to have war with Russia.
[01:13:50.643 --> 01:13:56.806]  I mean, it's total psych warfare joke level.
[01:13:56.806 --> 01:14:01.628]  And it's the stuff that ends civilizations.
[01:14:01.628 --> 01:14:06.931]  It's crazy town is what it is.
[01:14:06.931 --> 01:14:12.474]  It's crazy town to have a general say we need to start killing Russians in very large numbers.
[01:14:12.474 --> 01:14:14.375]  That is over-the-top war rhetoric.
[01:14:15.327 --> 01:14:22.091]  When Iran talks like that, we all freak out and go, oh my gosh, what horrible rhetoric.
[01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:22.691]  And it is.
[01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:32.036]  It's bad.
[01:14:32.036 --> 01:14:35.438]  Start killing Russians in large numbers.
[01:14:35.438 --> 01:14:37.319]  And then I've got this report that ties into that.
[01:14:37.319 --> 01:14:39.660]  Well, I guess the Russians are going to start talking like that.
[01:14:42.429 --> 01:14:46.873]  An address made late last week and translated by the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:49.415]  People are, like, in the comments going, he didn't say that in full wars.
[01:14:49.415 --> 01:14:49.675]  Oh, really?
[01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:50.836]  We're linked to the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:14:50.836 --> 01:14:52.758]  We have the transcript.
[01:14:52.758 --> 01:14:54.239]  There's always denial.
[01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:57.201]  There's not BPA making the fish asexual.
[01:14:57.201 --> 01:14:57.542]  Oh, really?
[01:14:57.542 --> 01:14:58.422]  CBS News Today.
[01:14:58.422 --> 01:15:00.424]  Well, what are you against that?
[01:15:00.424 --> 01:15:02.045]  Drink the BPA, Alex.
[01:15:02.045 --> 01:15:04.647]  Do it or you're a homophobe.
[01:15:04.647 --> 01:15:08.371]  Russian analyst calls for nuclear attack on Yellowstone National Park.
[01:15:09.264 --> 01:15:11.766]  The consequences will be catastrophic for the United States.
[01:15:11.766 --> 01:15:14.969]  Russian geopolitical analyst, how do you pronounce that?
[01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:19.914]  I know this guy's an advisor to Putin, Konstantin Shivkov.
[01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:21.435]  I believe so.
[01:15:21.435 --> 01:15:25.960]  Has called for Moscow to launch a nuclear attack on Yellowstone National Park.
[01:15:27.128 --> 01:15:33.169]  And the San Andreas Fault Line, noting that the devastating consequences would disappear the United States as a country.
[01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:39.891]  Sivkov made the comments in a piece for Russian trade newspaper, VPK News, which was translated by the Sydney Morning Herald.
[01:15:39.891 --> 01:15:42.331]  He's also made similar statements and speeches.
[01:15:42.331 --> 01:15:47.552]  Arguing that NATO aggression against Russia required the complete destruction of the enemy.
[01:15:47.552 --> 01:15:50.573]  Sivkov went on to depict a chilling scenario.
[01:15:57.284 --> 01:16:03.080]  Geologists believe that the Yellowstone supervolcano, this is quoting him, geologists believe the supervolcano at Yellowstone...
[01:16:04.275 --> 01:16:05.896]  Will explode at any moment.
[01:16:05.896 --> 01:16:07.436]  There are signs of growing activity there.
[01:16:07.436 --> 01:16:15.459]  Therefore, it suffices to push the relatively small, for example, the impact of a munition megaton class to ignite an eruption.
[01:16:15.459 --> 01:16:17.640]  The consequences will be catastrophic for the United States.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.621]  A country just disappears.
[01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:23.883]  Well, yeah, a lot of scientists, geologists, and others believe there's a major nuclear war.
[01:16:23.883 --> 01:16:29.785]  It'll trigger giant earthquakes and volcanoes that are even extinct will start blowing their tops.
[01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.426]  Because you're going to have
[01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:36.888]  Major seismic energy shifts, and it's not pretty.
[01:16:36.888 --> 01:16:42.269]  The Yellowstone supervolcano eruption would kill millions of people in an initial blast, and bury much of the United States in volcanic ash.
[01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:45.430]  Well, it doesn't matter, as long as we've got trannies.
[01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:48.250]  According to some experts, it would cause the end of the world.
[01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:52.831]  And again, folks, I'm not even against these people, it's just that you turn on any channel, that's all you hear on the news.
[01:16:52.831 --> 01:16:56.572]  Just battering people over the head with it.
[01:16:56.572 --> 01:16:58.892]  And what'd you see happen in Rome right before its collapse?
[01:16:58.892 --> 01:17:01.053]  According to some experts, it could cause the end of the world.
[01:17:02.003 --> 01:17:03.184]  So what?
[01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:05.926]  As long as a tranny pulls the switch, it won't be racist.
[01:17:05.926 --> 01:17:14.131]  The last time a supervolcano exploded in Siberia, 85% of all land species, 95% of all ocean dwellers, were completely wiped out, he wrote.
[01:17:15.576 --> 01:17:25.680]  In 2013, it was revealed that the magma below Yellowstone was two and a half times larger than previously thought, giving the part supervolcano the potential to cause an eruption 2,000 times more powerful than the Mount St.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.700]  Helens eruption.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.461]  Some experts say the caldera is overdue to erupt.
[01:17:29.461 --> 01:17:31.782]  They declared national security on that, I should add.
[01:17:31.782 --> 01:17:38.465]  Sivkov also said the Russian geography protected it from the threat posed by tsunamis.
[01:17:38.465 --> 01:17:42.146]  One could be triggered in the United States with an attack on the San Andreas Fault.
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:48.744]  Another valuable and vulnerable area of the United States, geopolitical point of view, is the San Andreas Fault.
[01:17:48.744 --> 01:17:51.707]  1,300 kilometers between the Pacific and North American plates.
[01:17:51.707 --> 01:18:01.314]  A detonation of nuclear weapons there can trigger a catastrophic event like the Coast Scale Tsunami, which can completely destroy the infrastructure of the United States forever.
[01:18:01.314 --> 01:18:06.578]  Doesn't matter though, the Californians are in California's sun and they're not worried about it.
[01:18:06.578 --> 01:18:10.321]  America was invincible, just like the Titanic, right?
[01:18:10.321 --> 01:18:11.842]  It's still we the people, right?
[01:18:13.399 --> 01:18:16.262]  Sessions of the San Andreas Fault are overdue for major earthquake activity.
[01:18:16.262 --> 01:18:26.713]  Researchers found that three sections of the San Andreas Fault system in Northern California, Hayward, Rogers Creek and Green Valley, are either near or part past their average reoccurrence interval.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:33.906]  And have accumulated sufficient strain to trigger earthquakes of a magnitude 6.8 or greater, CBS reports.
[01:18:33.906 --> 01:18:46.298]  Fearing that NATO and the United States plan to destroy Russia, Sivkov says Moscow is in a much worse position than 50 years ago because it has far fewer allies and cannot compete against the military might of NATO and its allies.
[01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:56.305]  While it would be unthinkable for anyone inside the Kremlin to take Shivkov's comments seriously, his rhetoric illustrates how fraught the tensions are between Moscow and Washington.
[01:18:56.305 --> 01:18:58.806]  Man, Watson writes some great articles, doesn't he?
[01:18:58.806 --> 01:19:13.811]  Last month, General Sir Adrian Bradshaw, NATO's Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, but see, it's okay because he has a sir in front of his name, warned that the threat of conflict with Russia represents an existential threat to the whole being.
[01:19:13.811 --> 01:19:14.311]  I agree with that.
[01:19:17.731 --> 01:19:22.153]  Meanwhile, I have this article, the next generation of weapons that Russia will use against the United States in World War III.
[01:19:22.153 --> 01:19:25.935]  We're going to look at some of that in the next segment.
[01:19:25.935 --> 01:19:35.679]  And I'm ahead of a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet that opened the phones up, but here's the deal.
[01:19:35.679 --> 01:19:45.344]  The government is running around like a chicken with its head cut off, preparing for war with basically the Russians, the Chinese, and conservatives and libertarians.
[01:19:45.344 --> 01:19:47.305]  George Soros is trying to start a war with the police.
[01:19:49.264 --> 01:19:54.352]  The media is trying to get everybody totally confused from everything about the family to sexuality.
[01:19:54.352 --> 01:19:57.017]  This is a total 360 attack on humanity.
[01:19:57.017 --> 01:19:58.139]  This is anti-human, period.
[01:19:59.244 --> 01:20:01.965]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:06.266]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:07.666]  Silverlungs.com.
[01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:10.347]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.328]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:20:13.328 --> 01:20:15.688]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[01:20:15.688 --> 01:20:17.589]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:20:17.589 --> 01:20:23.150]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:26.972]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[01:20:26.972 --> 01:20:28.472]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[01:20:28.872 --> 01:20:30.132]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:30.132 --> 01:20:34.613]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:20:34.613 --> 01:20:40.315]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:20:40.315 --> 01:20:43.856]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:43.856 --> 01:20:46.576]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:51.577]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:20:58.419 --> 01:21:02.645]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:21:02.645 --> 01:21:03.286]  It's true.
[01:21:03.286 --> 01:21:07.432]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:21:07.432 --> 01:21:09.835]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:21:09.835 --> 01:21:14.302]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:21:14.602 --> 01:21:27.481]  New NSF EPA Certified Lab Tests show EPA Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride, and much more.

[01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.047]  Big Berkey.
[01:21:39.047 --> 01:21:42.748]  The one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:21:58.089 --> 01:22:00.931]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:00.931 --> 01:22:06.035]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:22:06.035 --> 01:22:14.161]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:18.705]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:22:18.705 --> 01:22:22.508]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:22.648 --> 01:22:28.592]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:28.592 --> 01:22:31.774]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:31.774 --> 01:22:37.138]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:22:37.138 --> 01:22:45.323]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:22:45.323 --> 01:22:45.503]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:22:57.649 --> 01:23:01.250]  Music, one of life's greatest pleasures, has tremendous power.
[01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:04.650]  The power to bring a tear to the eye or to quiet a racing mind.
[01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:14.072]  Music also has the power to heal and has been used through the centuries to treat depression, create energy, induce sleep, relieve stress and chronic pain.
[01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:18.793]  Now, Michael Torello's created Whole Tones, the healing frequency music project.
[01:23:19.193 --> 01:23:25.377]  These frequencies were uncovered in the music of King David and believed to have astounding healing effects.
[01:23:25.377 --> 01:23:33.242]  Now, you can benefit from healing music therapy simply by listening daily to this music in the comfort of your own home or office.
[01:23:33.242 --> 01:23:34.143]  It's a new year.

[01:24:28.126 --> 01:24:34.409]  The rusted chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[01:24:34.409 --> 01:24:42.873]  I walk the road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[01:24:42.873 --> 01:24:49.856]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing.
[01:24:49.856 --> 01:24:55.299]  Three lullabies in an ancient tongue for the court of the crown.
[01:24:57.515 --> 01:24:59.417]  The Crimson King of the Devil.
[01:24:59.417 --> 01:25:05.663]  The court of the Crimson King, this planet.
[01:25:05.663 --> 01:25:10.267]  Oh, but the governments are corrupt, the elites aren't bad.
[01:25:10.267 --> 01:25:12.950]  The world isn't in the hands of the wicked one.
[01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:20.738]  I want to cut, for TV viewers, your radio listener, InfoWars.com forward slash show to the free feed, to our control room.
[01:25:22.166 --> 01:25:34.556]  20 years of work, they'll launch a media platform like this that reaches upwards of 20 million people a week, and under the new internet rules, regulations, and taxes that guess what they're now announcing?
[01:25:34.556 --> 01:25:38.719]  They will be able to basically try to squeeze this out.
[01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:49.788]  We've gotten big enough that they may just be able to slow down our growth, but other alternative media, other new media, they may be able to shut down, and that's what this plan is all about.
[01:25:50.905 --> 01:25:58.267]  Continuing the next generation of weapons that Russia will use against the United States in World War III.
[01:25:58.267 --> 01:26:06.328]  They're in the midst of a sweeping modernization program, new hypersonic missiles, you name it.
[01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:09.269]  The Sarmat Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.
[01:26:09.269 --> 01:26:17.611]  Most Americans have heard of the infamous SS-18 Satan Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, but these are now being replaced by the Sarmat Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.
[01:26:17.611 --> 01:26:19.031]  The Sarmat, also known as the
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:32.467]  Sarmatan is a Russian liquid-fueled, MIRV-equipped, super-heavy thermonuclear intercontinental ballistic missile in development as of early 2015, intended to replace the previous SS-18.
[01:26:32.467 --> 01:26:32.927]  Satan!
[01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:40.823]  They also have Topol M's and carry extensive counter-missile defense measures.
[01:26:40.823 --> 01:26:55.006]  Its large payload would allow for up to 10 heavy warheads or 15 lighter ones and or combination of warheads and massive amounts of countermeasures, dummy warheads, designed to defeat anti-missile systems via the MIRV system.
[01:26:55.006 --> 01:27:00.467]  China couldn't get MIRV from Russia, so they got it from, of course, Harry Clinton.
[01:27:01.676 --> 01:27:03.617]  That's not treason, folks.
[01:27:03.617 --> 01:27:19.765]  The Sarmat is expected to be ready for deployment around 2020, but other sources state the program is being fast-tracked and it could comprise up to 80% of Russia's land-based nuclear arsenal by 2021.
[01:27:19.765 --> 01:27:29.530]  Well, the big threat is their submarines with cruise missiles, because they pop up off the coast, fire the cruise missiles, they fly in under the radar and hit our coastal cities, which is the majority.
[01:27:31.277 --> 01:27:36.182]  In coastal military bases, that's really the big threat.
[01:27:36.182 --> 01:27:38.684]  The Borey-class nuclear submarine.
[01:27:38.684 --> 01:27:44.470]  Even greater concern, as I was just saying, of the Sarmat, are the new Borey-class nuclear submarines that Russia is building.
[01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:51.256]  The following is from an article about the launch of one of these new submarines, the Vladimir Monikov, and I pronounced that in 2013.
[01:27:51.256 --> 01:27:55.561]  Russia originally launched its near-silent submarine following several years of development.
[01:27:56.653 --> 01:28:08.402]  The Borey class, dubbed the Vladimir, has a new generation nuclear reactor, can dive deeper than 1,000 feet, and carries 20 nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.
[01:28:08.402 --> 01:28:18.490]  Each of these ICBMs can carry 10 detachable MIRV warheads, which can re-enter vehicles capable of delivering 150 kilotons yields per warhead.
[01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:19.691]  That'll really make you have a nice day.
[01:28:22.404 --> 01:28:26.205]  One kiloton in downtown Austin would destroy the entire downtown.
[01:28:26.205 --> 01:28:28.166]  How about 150 kilotons?
[01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:32.808]  Luckily, tests of the warheads only yielded 11 successes out of 20 attempts.
[01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:40.791]  Which doesn't mean they aren't concerned MIRVs aren't what shook World War to the foundations when they first appeared in the 70s.
[01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:41.431]  Let's just go on.
[01:28:41.431 --> 01:28:46.953]  There's page after page of this.
[01:28:46.953 --> 01:28:48.214]  We've got the
[01:28:50.618 --> 01:28:53.360]  Bolva Submarine Launching Nuclear Missiles.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.201]  We've got them entering the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:28:55.201 --> 01:28:57.202]  Fox News AP reporting on that.
[01:28:57.202 --> 01:29:04.447]  The Russian nuclear-operated attack submarine, armed with long-range cruise missiles, operated undetected in the Gulf of Mexico for several weeks, and has traveled in strategic U.S.
[01:29:04.447 --> 01:29:04.728]  waters.
[01:29:04.728 --> 01:29:06.849]  It was only confirmed after it left the region.
[01:29:06.849 --> 01:29:11.012]  The Washington Freebie can learn.
[01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.433]  And it gets into all those submarines.
[01:29:14.926 --> 01:29:19.270]  Then there are strategic missile trains that they move around so you can't take them out.
[01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:23.735]  The S-500 missile defense system.
[01:29:23.735 --> 01:29:26.637]  And a lot more.
[01:29:26.637 --> 01:29:29.260]  And of course, people are like, well, we'll defeat them, don't worry.
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:30.261]  Yeah.
[01:29:30.261 --> 01:29:32.843]  It's like saying, we'll blow the planet up and they'll die first.
[01:29:32.843 --> 01:29:34.065]  We'll die ten minutes later.
[01:29:35.385 --> 01:29:37.186]  We'll detonate 10,000 nuclear weapons.
[01:29:37.186 --> 01:29:37.887]  That'll show you.
[01:29:37.887 --> 01:29:39.989]  Yeah, and kill everybody.
[01:29:39.989 --> 01:29:42.591]  People in bunkers will end up freezing to death in the nuclear winter.
[01:29:42.591 --> 01:29:44.232]  Maybe they'll last five years.
[01:29:44.232 --> 01:29:45.032]  It doesn't matter.
[01:29:45.032 --> 01:29:45.913]  You people are sick.
[01:29:45.913 --> 01:29:47.975]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:47.975 --> 01:29:49.356]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.356 --> 01:29:51.898]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:51.898 --> 01:29:54.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.216 --> 01:30:08.725]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.

[01:31:29.806 --> 01:31:39.068]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:31:39.068 --> 01:31:42.869]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:31:42.869 --> 01:31:51.211]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.
[01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:53.512]  Visit Infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:31:53.512 --> 01:31:54.572]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:58.584 --> 01:31:59.525]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[01:31:59.525 --> 01:32:00.085]  Good, brother.
[01:32:00.085 --> 01:32:01.807]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:32:01.807 --> 01:32:03.748]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:32:03.748 --> 01:32:07.792]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:32:07.792 --> 01:32:10.394]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[01:32:10.394 --> 01:32:12.836]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:32:12.836 --> 01:32:20.682]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:24.223]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:32:24.223 --> 01:32:25.784]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:25.784 --> 01:32:28.705]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:32:28.705 --> 01:32:30.446]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:32:30.446 --> 01:32:36.248]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[01:32:36.528 --> 01:32:38.309]  Or maximum potency.
[01:32:38.309 --> 01:32:48.513]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going goes right to the source.
[01:32:48.513 --> 01:32:50.314]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.
[01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:57.257]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your super male vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[01:33:02.637 --> 01:33:07.021]  Google controls what we buy, the news we read, and Obama policies.
[01:33:07.021 --> 01:33:11.204]  Now under investigation by Congress.
[01:33:11.204 --> 01:33:13.926]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:13.926 --> 01:33:14.707]  Yeah, crank it up!
[01:33:14.707 --> 01:33:18.990]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:21.252]  I'm up here in space.
[01:33:21.252 --> 01:33:24.074]  I'm looking down on you.
[01:33:24.074 --> 01:33:26.536]  My laser's trace.
[01:33:26.536 --> 01:33:27.357]  Everything you do.
[01:33:28.761 --> 01:33:31.782]  You think you've got private lives?
[01:33:31.782 --> 01:33:34.482]  Think nothing of the kind!
[01:33:34.482 --> 01:33:36.503]  There is no true escape!
[01:33:36.503 --> 01:33:39.104]  I'm watching all the time!
[01:33:39.104 --> 01:33:41.504]  I'm elemental!
[01:33:41.504 --> 01:33:44.305]  My sight is clean!
[01:33:44.305 --> 01:33:45.985]  I am perpetual!
[01:33:45.985 --> 01:33:48.466]  I keep the country free!
[01:33:48.466 --> 01:33:48.966]  Bull!
[01:33:56.328 --> 01:34:00.371]  No, we don't have a computer robot taking over this like GoldenEye.
[01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:06.216]  You get a Patriot computer.
[01:34:06.216 --> 01:34:09.979]  It's a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:09.979 --> 01:34:13.862]  The whole thing.
[01:34:13.862 --> 01:34:17.105]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:34:17.105 --> 01:34:20.187]  Specifically on, what do you think is more important?
[01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:21.769]  The massive chemical warfare?
[01:34:21.769 --> 01:34:22.990]  A higher order of killing?
[01:34:24.718 --> 01:34:30.579]  That we're under with just the chemicals in the food and water.
[01:34:30.579 --> 01:34:31.799]  The sperm level's plunging.
[01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.560]  It's the end of humanity as we know it very, very soon.
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:36.720]  We're all just calmly enjoying ourselves.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:41.081]  Video showing troops in Florida training to intern citizens in Fort Lauderdale.
[01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:46.182]  Does that matter to anybody?
[01:34:46.182 --> 01:34:49.863]  EAS alerts now an hour long that take over all broadcasting cable.
[01:34:49.863 --> 01:34:52.824]  Just an hour long, every channel just taken over.
[01:34:52.824 --> 01:34:53.984]  Just to get the public ready for it.
[01:34:58.387 --> 01:34:59.548]  What do you think they're gearing up for?
[01:34:59.548 --> 01:35:09.373]  Why do you think every cop show I tune into shows police torturing people and disappearing them to secret sites to torture them?
[01:35:09.373 --> 01:35:14.116]  And then of course the torture is always good and always for a good reason.
[01:35:14.116 --> 01:35:21.039]  Why do you think the government wants the police to think the good thing to do is secretly torture people?
[01:35:21.039 --> 01:35:25.442]  Because they're planning a purge in this country of horrible totalitarianism.
[01:35:26.769 --> 01:35:33.553]  And see, we've kind of gone from people denying all this to going, okay, Alex, you're right.
[01:35:33.553 --> 01:35:35.554]  We better shut up and go along with them.
[01:35:35.554 --> 01:35:39.817]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[01:35:39.817 --> 01:35:49.482]  That's like saying, since there's a great white shark in the Pacific Ocean, I better go find one and cut my arm off and jump in offering it the rest of me.
[01:35:49.482 --> 01:35:52.544]  Giving in to tyrants is what has gotten us to this point.
[01:35:54.161 --> 01:35:55.662]  People say, well, I'm going to go along with it.
[01:35:55.662 --> 01:35:58.103]  Oh, they're going to go after you first.
[01:35:58.103 --> 01:36:00.924]  You're an easy target, chump.
[01:36:00.924 --> 01:36:08.008]  You'd be like a gazelle in the African savannah that saw Pride of Lions.
[01:36:08.008 --> 01:36:10.909]  And it said, well, I'm going to be friendly to the lions and they'll like me.
[01:36:10.909 --> 01:36:14.271]  I'm going to go lay down and show them my belly.
[01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:17.613]  And then they'll want to be my friend because I'm with them.
[01:36:17.613 --> 01:36:20.454]  I'll tell the lions where the gazelles are.
[01:36:21.753 --> 01:36:23.214]  I'll work with the Lions.
[01:36:23.214 --> 01:36:26.297]  And as the little gazelle walks over, Hi Lion!
[01:36:26.297 --> 01:36:27.378]  He's feeling kind of powerful.
[01:36:27.378 --> 01:36:28.538]  You're my friend.
[01:36:28.538 --> 01:36:31.241]  The lion just grabs him by the throat.
[01:36:31.241 --> 01:36:33.182]  Rips it out.
[01:36:33.182 --> 01:36:34.583]  And the gazelle goes, Trendy!
[01:36:34.583 --> 01:36:35.944]  I was trendy!
[01:36:35.944 --> 01:36:44.891]  As it flops around, blood spewing.
[01:36:44.891 --> 01:36:45.532]  It doesn't matter.
[01:36:45.532 --> 01:36:46.993]  You can see everything's coming to a head.
[01:36:46.993 --> 01:36:49.195]  All you people that love the system, just enjoy it.
[01:36:50.442 --> 01:36:55.818]  Just enjoy global depression, just enjoy the rioting, the checkpoints, the wars, just all of it.
[01:36:55.818 --> 01:36:56.901]  It's what you want.
[01:36:56.901 --> 01:36:58.325]  And quite frankly, we all deserve it.
[01:37:00.049 --> 01:37:01.310]  We killed 55 million.
[01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:03.291]  I keep saying 53 million.
[01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:04.111]  The numbers are up.
[01:37:04.111 --> 01:37:09.194]  Some estimates are 56 million abortions in this country since Roe v. Wade.
[01:37:09.194 --> 01:37:10.495]  And hey, those aren't humans.
[01:37:10.495 --> 01:37:11.656]  They didn't deserve to be protected.
[01:37:11.656 --> 01:37:12.276]  Neither do we.
[01:37:12.276 --> 01:37:13.076]  We're not humans either.
[01:37:13.076 --> 01:37:14.117]  And that's what they're saying now.
[01:37:14.117 --> 01:37:15.358]  They're going, you have no free will.
[01:37:15.358 --> 01:37:16.458]  People aren't even people.
[01:37:16.458 --> 01:37:17.519]  You have no rights.
[01:37:17.519 --> 01:37:19.240]  Bioethics boards will decide everything.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.741]  Oh, the troops are worthless after they've served.
[01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:23.502]  Let's just euthanize them too.
[01:37:23.502 --> 01:37:24.563]  Let's just not give them treatment.
[01:37:25.143 --> 01:37:25.924]  It's the trendy thing.
[01:37:25.924 --> 01:37:44.515]  I mean, as long as we say it in an NPR voice about the needs and how we've got to take care of it and about budgetary things and it's a tough job of the ethics committees but they're doing the right thing and now the Watson computer helps them make the decision where it's not their fault that the veterans secretly don't get the health care.
[01:37:45.616 --> 01:37:47.097]  You know, the computer said so.
[01:37:47.097 --> 01:37:53.803]  It's not the Nazis' fault that the Hollerith Watson machine of 1942's did it.
[01:37:53.803 --> 01:37:57.125]  You know, it was the machine that said do it then.
[01:37:57.125 --> 01:38:03.070]  It doesn't matter it's the exact same company with the exact same name with a high-tech system deciding who to kill now.
[01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:14.017]  As long as you just do it in a voice like this and go, ooh, it's very reasonable, very liberal, and just act real effeminate and go, uh, uh, uh, then it's all cute.
[01:38:14.017 --> 01:38:22.862]  And then you have generals up on TV going, yeah, let's just have a bunch of body bags and kill a whole bunch of Russians, send in NATO troops.
[01:38:22.862 --> 01:38:27.025]  I remember like six months ago they showed the head of NATO laughing.
[01:38:27.759 --> 01:38:30.360]  He looked all soft for a general.
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.301]  He was up there going, yeah, we got weapons.
[01:38:32.301 --> 01:38:33.362]  We'll take out the Russians.
[01:38:33.362 --> 01:38:36.923]  They're nothing.
[01:38:36.923 --> 01:38:45.947]  I mean, even if I was a tough guy, but I was going to get in a fight with somebody that I thought I could beat, but I knew this person would still hurt me bad.
[01:38:45.947 --> 01:38:46.948]  I wouldn't be arrogant about it.
[01:38:52.688 --> 01:38:57.290]  But this would be like going into a knife fight with somebody you know how to use a knife.
[01:38:57.290 --> 01:39:00.372]  They got two butcher knives in each hand, and you got two butcher knives.
[01:39:00.372 --> 01:39:02.733]  You're just like, huh, this is really fun!
[01:39:02.733 --> 01:39:07.155]  Let's have this knife fight for no reason, but so a bunch of bankers can try to take over.
[01:39:07.155 --> 01:39:07.776]  Let's do this!
[01:39:07.776 --> 01:39:09.457]  This is a really great idea!
[01:39:09.457 --> 01:39:16.020]  And it's all being done by a bunch of soft chicken hawks, if you look up their records.
[01:39:18.066 --> 01:39:21.848]  The military people, the generals that have been in heavy combat are freaking out.
[01:39:21.848 --> 01:39:24.449]  I don't care whether they call themselves liberal or conservative.
[01:39:24.449 --> 01:39:25.530]  They're all over the news.
[01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:28.831]  I just read a headline earlier saying this is a threat to the entire globe.
[01:39:28.831 --> 01:39:30.232]  This has got to stop right now.
[01:39:30.232 --> 01:39:35.695]  This is insane what's going on.
[01:39:35.695 --> 01:39:36.735]  But I'm telling you what's happened.
[01:39:36.735 --> 01:39:41.558]  The globalists have put out propaganda selling tyranny in the movies and TV.
[01:39:41.558 --> 01:39:47.221]  And the globalists themselves are watching this and believing it and have become megalomaniacal nutcases.
[01:39:48.396 --> 01:39:57.384]  I've run up my whole life against crazy people who think they're invincible.
[01:39:57.384 --> 01:39:59.365]  They think they're invincible.
[01:39:59.365 --> 01:40:05.391]  They pull their truck up in front of you on some dirt road, jump out, come over and start, you know, beating your window out with a hammer.
[01:40:05.391 --> 01:40:12.377]  And they don't know you're just going to slam the door into them, get out, kick them right in the groin, get their head and start slamming it in the ground.
[01:40:12.377 --> 01:40:15.980]  They don't know just because you're acting nice that you aren't more vicious than they are.
[01:40:16.954 --> 01:40:20.755]  But these globalists aren't even getting out on a dirt road with a hammer and coming after somebody.
[01:40:20.755 --> 01:40:25.737]  They are messing with nuclear weapons.
[01:40:25.737 --> 01:40:33.640]  I've dealt with people in business and life who just go crazy and decide you shouldn't be the number one guy in Patriot, Libertarian talk radio.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:41.422]  I'm better than you and they just make up lies and go crazy and attack you and then destroy themselves and then can't believe that they failed or
[01:40:45.247 --> 01:40:48.028]  We probably all have that in relationships.
[01:40:48.028 --> 01:40:49.689]  People that just make stuff up.
[01:40:49.689 --> 01:40:50.949]  People that just lie to your face.
[01:40:50.949 --> 01:40:53.410]  People that just think they're going to get away with it forever.
[01:40:53.410 --> 01:40:56.852]  So many weak-minded people have an arrogance to them.
[01:40:56.852 --> 01:41:02.754]  A narcissistic attitude that they can't be defeated.
[01:41:08.672 --> 01:41:18.197]  If you look at historical examples of this, this is when empires destroy themselves, but this time there's nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, and God knows what else.
[01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:22.799]  And the elite are all acting crazy.
[01:41:22.799 --> 01:41:25.961]  And the rhetoric is escalating to levels it never did before.
[01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:28.482]  Nobody talked like this during the Cold War.
[01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:31.644]  Republican, Democrat, you name it, no general ever talked like this.
[01:41:32.597 --> 01:41:38.442]  Curtis LeMay in Joint Chiefs of Staff meetings talked about a survivable war with Russia and nuking them first.
[01:41:38.442 --> 01:41:43.325]  And Kennedy, well actually Eisenhower and then Kennedy had them all fired.
[01:41:43.325 --> 01:41:49.690]  Because it's psychotic.
[01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:51.432]  It is psychotic.
[01:41:51.432 --> 01:41:56.796]  It was psychotic of Hitler to attack Russia when he was already losing the war in Africa.
[01:42:04.002 --> 01:42:04.302]  U.S.
[01:42:04.302 --> 01:42:07.064]  forces are absolutely at the breaking point.
[01:42:07.064 --> 01:42:15.109]  Just like Hitler kept telling Erwin Rommel, who was probably the top general of World War II, with half the force, I want you to defeat the Americans and the British and others.
[01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:19.371]  And he did beat them until he ran out of ammunition.
[01:42:19.371 --> 01:42:21.653]  And fuel.
[01:42:21.653 --> 01:42:28.037]  And then, when he withdrew back to Germany, Hitler was jealous of him and had him killed.
[01:42:28.037 --> 01:42:31.859]  Because he also knew Rommel was secretly going around saying, we gotta take this guy out.
[01:42:33.012 --> 01:42:39.134]  And then you know what happened a little while later, Operation Valkyrie.
[01:42:39.134 --> 01:42:48.777]  And just remember that all of you that serve the system, who actually are ready to fight, who are men, the parasites above you hate your guts.
[01:42:48.777 --> 01:42:51.018]  And I can't really compare the parasites of today to Hitler.
[01:42:51.018 --> 01:42:54.900]  He was a psychopath, but at least he had the Iron Cross First Class.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:59.961]  That's the Congressional Medal of Honor from World War I. You never see that in the media.
[01:42:59.961 --> 01:43:01.222]  Why would all those people follow Hitler?
[01:43:01.222 --> 01:43:01.802]  He was a war hero.
[01:43:03.183 --> 01:43:07.953]  He had two iron crosses.
[01:43:07.953 --> 01:43:09.476]  He's still jealous of Erwin Rommel.
[01:43:16.462 --> 01:43:17.723]  We are screwed.
[01:43:17.723 --> 01:43:19.384]  I can tell you right now, we're screwed, folks.
[01:43:19.384 --> 01:43:21.365]  I mean, this probably is going to be Armageddon or something.
[01:43:21.365 --> 01:43:22.726]  I mean, I can just feel it.
[01:43:22.726 --> 01:43:23.227]  I can see it.
[01:43:23.227 --> 01:43:24.868]  I've had dread building for years.
[01:43:24.868 --> 01:43:26.309]  And now I look at the political class.
[01:43:26.309 --> 01:43:27.830]  I mean, look at Hillary Clinton.
[01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:29.511]  Look at, look at Joe Biden.
[01:43:29.511 --> 01:43:31.632]  I mean, look at Boehner.
[01:43:31.632 --> 01:43:34.274]  Look at these sacks of crap.
[01:43:34.274 --> 01:43:36.996]  Look at Michael Moore.
[01:43:36.996 --> 01:43:42.559]  He has six bodyguards on record at all times with guns.
[01:43:42.559 --> 01:43:44.641]  And he doesn't want you to have a gun to protect you and your family.
[01:43:49.602 --> 01:44:03.344]  And they are giving every Mexican girl in Mexico right now, forcibly, so you know it's coming here, Gardasil shots.
[01:44:03.344 --> 01:44:10.486]  They lied and said Gardasil shots were a total lie by Governor Rick Perry at the time.
[01:44:10.486 --> 01:44:11.946]  I told you it was a hoax.
[01:44:11.946 --> 01:44:16.387]  And newspapers would call me and say, how do you know it's not a law?
[01:44:16.387 --> 01:44:18.727]  And I went, there is no law from the legislature.
[01:44:19.997 --> 01:44:27.821]  He put it on the list of recommended vaccines at the health department, which they then lie at the schools and say is the law.
[01:44:27.821 --> 01:44:29.842]  And of course that hoax fell.
[01:44:29.842 --> 01:44:39.727]  The good news is we're able to defeat their hoaxes, but they hit us with so many more we can't defeat them all.
[01:44:39.727 --> 01:44:42.308]  And see my brain just swirls with the frustration.
[01:44:43.936 --> 01:44:50.879]  That the girls getting the Gardasil shot here, it's known to attack the ovaries, it's known to create autoimmune disorders, it's known to create infertility.
[01:44:50.879 --> 01:44:51.960]  That's what the shot really does.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.841]  It doesn't protect you from papillomavirus.
[01:44:53.841 --> 01:44:59.343]  The insert says that.
[01:44:59.343 --> 01:45:03.365]  And they're now forcing all their girls to take it.
[01:45:03.365 --> 01:45:10.089]  That was three years ago and now we're already getting the reports of them dying and being... and people are like, well there are too many Mexicans.
[01:45:10.089 --> 01:45:10.749]  You idiots!
[01:45:15.694 --> 01:45:17.215]  They're doing this to everyone.
[01:45:17.215 --> 01:45:19.537]  We're all having this done to us.
[01:45:19.537 --> 01:45:21.399]  You do it to anybody, you do it to me.
[01:45:21.399 --> 01:45:24.301]  You do it to somebody else, they do it to you.
[01:45:24.301 --> 01:45:26.643]  You don't get away with aborting babies.
[01:45:26.643 --> 01:45:28.945]  You don't get away with sterilizing women.
[01:45:28.945 --> 01:45:31.127]  You don't get away with starting a war with Russia.
[01:45:31.127 --> 01:45:33.089]  You don't get away with funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:45:33.089 --> 01:45:37.552]  It comes back on you, on your family, on your country.
[01:45:37.552 --> 01:45:41.896]  And it's the liberals pushing, let's vaccinate the Mexican girls.
[01:45:41.896 --> 01:45:42.737]  And let's abort them.
[01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:49.451]  You'll never hear La Raza or Meche or any of those groups saying, don't take the Gardasil, here's the study, don't have an abortion.
[01:45:49.451 --> 01:45:51.312]  Because they're there to kill you.
[01:45:51.312 --> 01:46:07.617]  They're there to use you, to drive down the wages, and become a political socialist class, to bring us into domestication, and then they're going to continue to kill you, dead in a hammer, with the diabetes and everything else.
[01:46:07.617 --> 01:46:09.438]  They're killing everybody.
[01:46:09.438 --> 01:46:10.218]  We're all in it together.
[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:13.020]  And I said I'd take phone calls.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:13.981]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:46:13.981 --> 01:46:18.802]  People can say, man, this is such a negative show.
[01:46:18.802 --> 01:46:20.262]  No, it's not.
[01:46:20.262 --> 01:46:27.004]  I'm telling you about the home invader that wants to rape you and kill your family that's gotten in the front door.
[01:46:27.004 --> 01:46:29.825]  Denying it only means you won't be ready.
[01:46:29.825 --> 01:46:31.905]  This is the good news is we know the enemy plan.
[01:46:31.905 --> 01:46:31.945]  800-259-9231.
[01:46:38.573 --> 01:46:42.795]  Very briefly, it will sell out in the next day.
[01:46:42.795 --> 01:46:58.842]  If you want the vitamin D, super high quality vitamin D3, totally organic, supercharged, our newest product, Winter Sun, it is basically the hormone base, that's what it is, that all the other hormones basically metabolize and operate off of.
[01:46:58.842 --> 01:47:01.323]  You've got to have this to build the juice that
[01:47:02.227 --> 01:47:02.307]  Yeah.
[01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:37.053]  And it'll probably sell out about a week after that, but the sale's going to end today.
[01:47:37.053 --> 01:47:39.635]  Last day to save 30% off on DNA Force.
[01:47:39.635 --> 01:47:41.837]  DNA is the blueprint for humanity.
[01:47:41.837 --> 01:47:44.459]  Give your body the force field it needs.
[01:47:44.459 --> 01:47:48.223]  DNA Force is our most hardcore product yet from ForrestLife.com.
[01:47:48.223 --> 01:47:52.387]  Exclusive formula loaded with BioPQQ compound, which is backed by 175 clinical studies.
[01:47:54.028 --> 01:48:01.655]  Contains more potent antitoxin activity than vitamin C. Extremely hard to produce with our nutraceutical manufacturing process.
[01:48:01.655 --> 01:48:03.737]  Fight for your humanity with DNA force.
[01:48:03.737 --> 01:48:08.222]  It helps your cells basically offload the grunge that's built up inside of them.
[01:48:08.222 --> 01:48:12.326]  And with the lawyers, this is one of the few supplements you can actually make claims.
[01:48:12.326 --> 01:48:17.110]  But we're specific on the website from the lawyers and the scientists what we can say.
[01:48:17.110 --> 01:48:18.151]  We have informational videos.
[01:48:18.772 --> 01:48:23.443]  This stuff actually preserves your DNA, your telomeres, you name it.
[01:48:23.443 --> 01:48:24.886]  It is amazing.
[01:48:24.886 --> 01:48:28.535]  And it costs $12,000 a kilo just for one of the ingredients.
[01:48:29.454 --> 01:48:37.416]  So it is expensive, but compared to leading competitors that aren't even as good, it's... Some leading competitors are three times more for similar ones.
[01:48:37.416 --> 01:48:41.657]  And then they've even got synthetic BioPQQ and CoQ10 and stuff.
[01:48:41.657 --> 01:48:50.459]  We have the only non-GMO organic BioPQQ that... We have to buy it from the Japanese.
[01:48:50.459 --> 01:48:52.300]  They have a facility here in the U.S.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:54.380]  from Mitsubishi.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.341]  This is what the rich Japanese are gobbling, okay?
[01:48:57.196 --> 01:48:59.538]  And they know what they're doing, they're the longest living people on the planet.
[01:48:59.538 --> 01:49:01.860]  This is what the Japanese do, okay?
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:05.603]  This is from Mitsubishi, their genetic engineering department.
[01:49:05.603 --> 01:49:20.977]  So, it's, I mean, my dad wanted to make, working with Dr. Group and others, my dad's a chemist as well, joke level, for himself and family, joke level, uh, longevity type thing.
[01:49:22.659 --> 01:49:37.713]  And again, we have the poor man's, it's not just for your eyes, we have Occupower, that is the poor man's version of DNA Force that has a lot of the same things, but you just can't make the claims because it's natural compounds that are associated with these compounds.
[01:49:37.713 --> 01:49:43.518]  But it's the poor man's DNA Force, and all your purchases make the transmission possible.
[01:49:43.518 --> 01:49:45.160]  Again, you can also call 888-253-3139.
[01:49:49.804 --> 01:49:49.905]  888-253-3139.
[01:49:49.905 --> 01:49:52.708]  We need the InfoWar to be well funded.
[01:49:52.708 --> 01:49:53.709]  We need it to continue on.
[01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:54.590]  We've got enough money.
[01:49:55.953 --> 01:50:08.038]  To operate as we are right now and maybe expand a little bit, but if something happens to me or we have other problems or unforeseen things and anybody knows you run an operation can happen, we would be in trouble and start contracting.
[01:50:08.038 --> 01:50:10.519]  So we're not in a really good position.
[01:50:10.519 --> 01:50:15.641]  Compared to other media, we're in a very good position because we're growing and we're seen as trustworthy.
[01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:19.862]  But still in this climate, this economy, we're not in the position something this important needs to be.
[01:50:21.383 --> 01:50:24.885]  I need mid-air refueling, is what I call it, to get these bombs over the target.
[01:50:24.885 --> 01:50:26.966]  We're running these Sardis into the enemy territory.
[01:50:26.966 --> 01:50:27.787]  We go over the target.
[01:50:27.787 --> 01:50:28.767]  We take the heat.
[01:50:28.767 --> 01:50:31.789]  We're attacked by mainstream news savagely, probably more than anybody now.
[01:50:31.789 --> 01:50:34.951]  I mean, I'm attacked more than Rush Limbaugh now.
[01:50:34.951 --> 01:50:37.372]  In print, at least, and online.
[01:50:37.372 --> 01:50:39.413]  And pretty much on broadcast TV now.
[01:50:39.413 --> 01:50:41.494]  I mean, movies, you name it.
[01:50:41.494 --> 01:50:42.675]  I mean, they are coming after us.
[01:50:42.675 --> 01:50:46.137]  Because if they can take me down as an icon, they can take the Liberty Movement down.
[01:50:46.417 --> 01:50:47.518]  Well, that's not true.
[01:50:47.518 --> 01:50:54.003]  Because the information's out, the enemy program is understood, and my job here is to go to seed in a good way.
[01:50:54.003 --> 01:50:59.347]  My job is to proliferate the Alex Jones information.
[01:50:59.347 --> 01:51:03.450]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[01:51:03.450 --> 01:51:06.633]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.633 --> 01:51:08.274]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.274 --> 01:51:11.617]  Arm your American body at InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[01:51:59.366 --> 01:52:08.848]  Infowarslife and Infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release, Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:52:08.848 --> 01:52:13.549]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.

[01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:53.370]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:52:53.370 --> 01:52:57.712]  Visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:52:57.712 --> 01:53:02.174]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:53:02.174 --> 01:53:07.296]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:53:07.296 --> 01:53:15.139]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:53:15.419 --> 01:53:19.943]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:53:19.943 --> 01:53:23.907]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:53:23.907 --> 01:53:29.872]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:53:29.872 --> 01:53:33.035]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:53:33.035 --> 01:53:38.160]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:40.582]  Before you slip into unconsciousness
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:14.108]  I'd like to have another kiss, another...
[01:54:21.491 --> 01:54:31.560]  We've got a bunch of arrogant, inbred globalists who think they're invincible running around.
[01:54:31.560 --> 01:54:33.021]  But they're not invincible.
[01:54:33.021 --> 01:54:34.602]  Hillary Clinton may end up going to jail.
[01:54:34.602 --> 01:54:38.766]  She's certainly not going to end up being able to run for president now.
[01:54:38.766 --> 01:54:40.808]  She's caught red-handed.
[01:54:40.808 --> 01:54:43.610]  The information got out.
[01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:46.913]  And yet again, it's hackers and other people that are helping expose all of this.
[01:54:52.418 --> 01:54:53.659]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:54:53.659 --> 01:55:00.444]  What do you think the big issue is here of all these crazy attacks, of all these things happening?
[01:55:00.444 --> 01:55:12.453]  What do you think about an hour-long EAS takeover of the east and part of the west coast last night, and then no response of why the government did it?
[01:55:12.453 --> 01:55:16.676]  I mean, they are gearing up.
[01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:18.678]  Let's go ahead and go to George in Connecticut.
[01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:19.619]  You're on the air.
[01:55:19.619 --> 01:55:19.939]  Welcome.
[01:55:21.215 --> 01:55:43.360]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say I think what we should do is have some sort of convention in Texas on one of the, during the states they want to invade and have everybody throughout the country basically inundate these cities and then maybe put up posters, maybe the big posters, even buy a couple of posters, put some money up for that and said traitors that don't follow the, what is it, posse comitatus.
[01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:45.861]  Did you just say shoot at the troops with paintball guns?
[01:56:07.066 --> 01:56:11.029]  Oh man, I tell ya, that's an interesting idea, but that would really blow up in everybody's face.
[01:56:11.029 --> 01:56:13.552]  The media would probably claim we were shooting at them with real guns.
[01:56:13.552 --> 01:56:15.273]  Then they'd say we hate the troops.
[01:56:15.273 --> 01:56:20.457]  Most of the troops are going to be doing legitimate training that they could be doing on bases.
[01:56:20.457 --> 01:56:24.141]  The overall PSYOP is just to condition the public to federalization.
[01:56:24.961 --> 01:56:42.103]  Uh, so I think we should give the troops themselves pamphlets and handouts about what's really going on and how it's a conditioning op, because they'll just have decontamination teams show up for the media and go, look, if there was ever a chemical spill, we're just here to help to make us look like we're unreasonable.
[01:56:42.103 --> 01:56:43.184]  The PSY op is...
[01:56:43.985 --> 01:56:50.588]  When we don't complain, they'll have a really serious drill with stuff exploding and practicing rounding up citizens and taking over the courthouse.
[01:56:50.588 --> 01:56:55.491]  When we do complain, they'll pull back and give kids Happy Meals.
[01:56:55.491 --> 01:57:00.253]  And again, that's done to make us look unreasonable during the takeover.
[01:57:00.253 --> 01:57:02.775]  But I do hear your point.
[01:57:02.775 --> 01:57:09.258]  There will be problems when they do unannounced drills in rural areas they've had helicopters shot at before.
[01:57:09.258 --> 01:57:12.439]  And that's never a good idea.
[01:57:12.439 --> 01:57:13.300]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:57:15.202 --> 01:57:17.903]  The info war is where it's at.
[01:57:17.903 --> 01:57:31.530]  Putting up posters in towns, the 18 towns they've listed in Texas where this is going to be happening so far, about how this is part of a larger conditioning program, that would be a good idea.
[01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:32.211]  Anything else, George?
[01:57:33.799 --> 01:57:37.943]  Yeah, I just wanted to put a footnote on the thing about Hitler you were talking about.
[01:57:37.943 --> 01:57:39.744]  He didn't really want to invade Russia.
[01:57:39.744 --> 01:57:44.108]  What happened was he got the information that they had such a large army.
[01:57:44.108 --> 01:57:49.292]  They had an army bigger than five times the Europeans together.
[01:57:49.292 --> 01:57:50.573]  Tanks, planes, etc, etc.
[01:57:51.654 --> 01:57:57.336]  And basically he did a preemptive strike because he knew they were going to strike him, so he struck before them.
[01:57:57.336 --> 01:58:04.419]  And that's, uh, you can find under Icebreaker, under Victor Cervenov, which you can find videos on the web.
[01:58:04.419 --> 01:58:05.499]  No, you're actually right.
[01:58:05.499 --> 01:58:08.760]  It was Operation Barbarossa.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:11.281]  And the argument was, is that the U.S.
[01:58:11.281 --> 01:58:16.343]  had been sending the ships through the Northern Passage
[01:58:17.406 --> 01:58:34.855]  to give them the tanks and the materials and the weapons to fight the main war against the Nazis and double-cross and so that's why Hitler did that but you saw how that ended for the Germans 20 million dead but you do know your history.
[01:58:34.855 --> 01:58:39.618]  The point is he's the one that invaded Russia first.
[01:58:39.618 --> 01:58:42.880]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:04.966 --> 02:00:06.267]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.267 --> 02:00:08.028]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.028 --> 02:00:09.790]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:11.371]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.371 --> 02:00:12.932]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.932 --> 02:00:17.116]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.116 --> 02:00:26.323]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.323 --> 02:00:27.604]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:00:29.039 --> 02:00:35.282]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Texas on Jade Helm.
[02:00:35.282 --> 02:00:36.202]  Jay, thanks for calling.
[02:00:36.202 --> 02:00:38.343]  Go ahead.
[02:00:38.343 --> 02:00:39.884]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:00:39.884 --> 02:00:44.266]  I just want you to hear this scenario and see what you think.
[02:00:44.266 --> 02:00:46.267]  Operation James held 15.
[02:00:46.267 --> 02:00:51.529]  You have these expanse over 9 states.
[02:00:51.529 --> 02:00:57.752]  And with that, with the open border and these Islamic camps, then ISIS fighters pop up.
[02:00:58.695 --> 02:01:14.445]  Then it shifts from there from a training thing to a real scenario where you have Boston bombing style searches for people that did like the 2013 Silicon Valley power grid attack.
[02:01:14.445 --> 02:01:21.249]  I've heard this scenario from actually police I know who are speculating but they say the problem with the drill this big
[02:01:22.378 --> 02:01:30.481]  Is that if the word is there's going to be a bunch of Boston bombing or mall shootings, and that's come out in the news, even the FBI said that after I've talked about it.
[02:01:30.481 --> 02:01:33.102]  They're saying ISIS is in all 50 states.
[02:01:33.102 --> 02:01:34.703]  They believe they're going to start attacking.
[02:01:34.703 --> 02:01:36.664]  They think the Southwest is the target.
[02:01:36.664 --> 02:01:40.125]  You have a Southwest drill that's covered in pre-positioned troops.
[02:01:40.125 --> 02:01:42.266]  The troops aren't part of it, but they leave the border open.
[02:01:42.266 --> 02:01:44.947]  The feds do to allow the infiltration.
[02:01:44.947 --> 02:01:46.968]  Then the troops think they're the saviors.
[02:01:46.968 --> 02:01:49.709]  The public now accepts permanent military occupation.
[02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:52.971]  Under the cover of getting rid of ISIS.
[02:01:52.971 --> 02:01:56.133]  I've heard that by some smart people.
[02:01:56.133 --> 02:02:03.218]  And we have thousands of Bin Ladens, somehow, that we always have to hunt for, in-country, forever and a day.
[02:02:04.201 --> 02:02:12.663]  That's right, and then they build up the paramilitary force like the Patriot Act and the rest of it, and they flip it onto the gun owners and the veterans, which again, we told folks they would do, and they've now done.
[02:02:12.663 --> 02:02:14.504]  Yes, that is, that's the scenario.
[02:02:14.504 --> 02:02:24.887]  It's why they've given the Stinger missiles to Al Qaeda, it's why they've armed them and turned, you know, the Middle East over to ISIS, is so they can then launch attacks, which they'll be launching legitimately.
[02:02:24.887 --> 02:02:26.527]  I mean, I mean, they really hate us.
[02:02:26.527 --> 02:02:28.248]  They're a real terror group.
[02:02:28.248 --> 02:02:32.369]  But that attack will be used to take our freedoms, absolutely.
[02:02:32.369 --> 02:02:33.109]  And the troops.
[02:02:33.869 --> 02:02:37.411]  The people that refuse to go along with it will be interned.
[02:02:37.411 --> 02:02:42.094]  They'll be called traitors who were fighting for ISIS, yeah.
[02:02:42.094 --> 02:02:48.298]  Yeah, they'll be labeled conspirators or enemy combatants and taken away.
[02:02:48.298 --> 02:02:55.622]  At the same time, while they're searching all these homes, then they're going to be taking guns and they're just going to be separating their wheat from the chaff.
[02:02:55.622 --> 02:02:56.523]  Incredible point.
[02:02:56.523 --> 02:02:57.884]  In fact, we should take this five minutes.
[02:02:58.644 --> 02:03:04.668]  Just this call and make it its own special report and then add the Boston bombing material, the other information.
[02:03:04.668 --> 02:03:14.314]  That's one real possible scenario because we can show people the Army War College reports saying in the future we believe the Tea Party will link up with Al Qaeda.
[02:03:14.314 --> 02:03:18.596]  Everybody knows the Tea Party's one problem is it might be Islamophobic.
[02:03:18.596 --> 02:03:25.401]  I mean it just goes too far in some cases with the jokes and you know racial comments towards Arabs and stuff in my view.
[02:03:26.141 --> 02:03:31.546]  To say that the Tea Party would work with radical Islamists is just like saying Superman works for Lex Luthor.
[02:03:31.546 --> 02:03:33.668]  It is upside down.
[02:03:33.668 --> 02:03:36.890]  Or it's like saying Martin Luther King was a Ku Klux Klan grand dragon.
[02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:38.592]  It's just not true.
[02:03:38.592 --> 02:03:44.637]  But no, that's the narrative they're pushing and what you're saying is one of the main scenarios and I think you're really on to something.
[02:03:44.637 --> 02:03:49.001]  You can close out with any other points you'd like to make, Jay.
[02:03:49.001 --> 02:03:50.362]  I typed up a paper on this.
[02:03:50.362 --> 02:03:52.504]  I wish you had a fax number that I could ship it to you.
[02:03:53.953 --> 02:03:59.888]  Yeah, why don't you just email it to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com?
[02:03:59.888 --> 02:04:02.654]  Or do you not use email?
[02:04:02.654 --> 02:04:03.396]  I try not to.
[02:04:04.511 --> 02:04:12.919]  I had a very dark blue helicopter two days ago fly right at the back door of my house, about 70 yards.
[02:04:12.919 --> 02:04:17.283]  Well listen brother, everybody thinks if they fight the tyranny that they're going to get spotlighted.
[02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:23.388]  The answer is be out in the open and then people in the system will actually hear what you're saying and admire you.
[02:04:23.388 --> 02:04:26.231]  Most of them are compartmentalized and want to know what's going on.
[02:04:26.231 --> 02:04:28.733]  But yeah, they have private, corporate, government, military.
[02:04:29.594 --> 02:04:33.415]  Flying around with ground penetrating radar, scanners, looking through everybody's walls.
[02:04:33.415 --> 02:04:35.136]  They claim it's the war on drugs.
[02:04:35.136 --> 02:04:38.617]  It's really just preparing for warfare against the people.
[02:04:38.617 --> 02:04:43.098]  So, if you've got a paper you've written up on this, you should just email it to InfoWars.com.
[02:04:43.098 --> 02:04:44.799]  If it's a good paper, we'll publish it.
[02:04:44.799 --> 02:04:46.319]  ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[02:04:46.319 --> 02:04:46.619]  Thank you.
[02:04:46.619 --> 02:04:47.819]  Great points, Jay.
[02:04:47.819 --> 02:04:50.520]  Yeah, it's time to step up, folks, and step out.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:52.461]  And just be out in the open.
[02:04:52.461 --> 02:04:54.541]  I mean, we're already all on the list, folks.
[02:04:54.541 --> 02:04:55.602]  It's time to fight.
[02:04:55.602 --> 02:04:56.262]  In the InfoWars.
[02:04:58.940 --> 02:05:04.084]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWars Life Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:05:04.084 --> 02:05:10.210]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:05:10.210 --> 02:05:14.993]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[02:05:14.993 --> 02:05:18.556]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[02:05:18.556 --> 02:05:20.138]  No needles, no injections.
[02:05:20.518 --> 02:05:25.924]  Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula right now at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:05:25.924 --> 02:05:27.406]  Alex Jones here.
[02:05:27.406 --> 02:05:38.759]  For the last two years, I've been working with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists to design a nutraceutical formulation that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[02:05:39.019 --> 02:05:42.841]  Introducing the all-new Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:51.164]  Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs and extracts with exciting new advances in nutraceutical science.

[02:05:58.527 --> 02:05:59.848]  The experts are clear.
[02:05:59.848 --> 02:06:06.950]  Sunlight, purified water, healthy non-GMO food, and having a good attitude is essential to a healthy immune system.
[02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:13.212]  But I go further with Super Nascent Iodine X2 from Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:13.212 --> 02:06:21.175]  50% stronger than our original and revolutionary Nascent Iodine formula, coming from a deep-earth crystal source that no other supplier has.
[02:06:21.175 --> 02:06:26.197]  Most other forms of iodine come from seaweed in areas plagued by Fukushima and other contaminants.
[02:06:26.477 --> 02:06:27.498]  Not our iodine.
[02:06:27.498 --> 02:06:31.300]  It comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits.
[02:06:31.300 --> 02:06:33.841]  And is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:06:58.433 --> 02:06:59.694]  Another major health threat.
[02:06:59.694 --> 02:07:04.676]  This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:07:04.676 --> 02:07:07.357]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:07:07.357 --> 02:07:14.380]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:17.361]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:07:17.361 --> 02:07:20.323]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:07:20.323 --> 02:07:22.344]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[02:07:22.344 --> 02:07:25.185]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:07:25.265 --> 02:07:30.987]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:07:30.987 --> 02:07:34.508]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:07:34.508 --> 02:07:37.589]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.
[02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:44.911]  The ProPure Pro1 G2.0 Water Filtration System is a must-have for every modern, independently-minded household.
[02:07:44.911 --> 02:07:48.132]  Protect your family's safety during an emergency.

[02:07:56.615 --> 02:08:12.880]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:14.381]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:30.006 --> 02:08:32.769]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:32.769 --> 02:08:34.510]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:38.314]  For much of the hour, we have Dr. Joseph Mercola joining us.
[02:08:38.314 --> 02:08:42.537]  Always extremely informative to cover a host of really exciting things.
[02:08:42.537 --> 02:08:45.260]  Very, very positive things that are unfolding and happening.
[02:08:45.260 --> 02:08:46.921]  Also some negative things.
[02:08:46.921 --> 02:08:53.267]  And then in the last ten minutes or so, I will, if you want to hold, go to Julio and Chad.
[02:08:53.267 --> 02:08:56.230]  Spencer says the military cover-ups.
[02:08:58.046 --> 02:09:01.128]  He wants to get into Intel on that front.
[02:09:01.128 --> 02:09:05.351]  Todd and others that are patiently holding.
[02:09:06.348 --> 02:09:11.772]  But before we go any further, Benghazi panel has summoned Hillary Clinton.
[02:09:11.772 --> 02:09:20.738]  A House panel today, that's Tuesday, formally requested Hillary Clinton to testify about her private server and email account she used while serving as Secretary of State.
[02:09:20.738 --> 02:09:33.267]  Representative Trey Gowdy, Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, hope he doesn't fly on too many airplanes, sent a request to Clinton's personal attorney, David E. Kendall, requesting that Clinton appear before the committee under oath.
[02:09:35.083 --> 02:09:36.244]  It's illegal what she did.
[02:09:36.244 --> 02:09:44.311]  We have video of Judge Andrew Napolitano on Infowars.com saying Hillary could teach Nixon a lesson about destroying evidence.
[02:09:44.311 --> 02:09:46.894]  Clinton's one device excuse proved to be a total lie.
[02:09:46.894 --> 02:09:49.296]  Now it's a iPad and other things.
[02:09:49.296 --> 02:09:51.358]  It doesn't matter.
[02:09:51.358 --> 02:10:01.227]  She was absconding doing official business violating the Open Records Act on a secret phone and system to hide what she was doing from Congress.
[02:10:03.851 --> 02:10:05.572]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:05.572 --> 02:10:08.074]  The story that's really hot, that should be red-linked at the top.
[02:10:08.074 --> 02:10:09.956]  I want to move it back to the top, actually.
[02:10:09.956 --> 02:10:13.419]  Russian analyst calls for nuclear attack on Yellowstone National Park.
[02:10:13.419 --> 02:10:14.920]  This is like a guy that has Putin's ear.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:18.563]  This just shows how the rhetoric has risen to this insane level after U.S.
[02:10:18.563 --> 02:10:22.566]  generals have called for, quote, killing Russians in large numbers.
[02:10:22.566 --> 02:10:24.107]  So that's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:10:24.107 --> 02:10:32.674]  But the reason I like to cover this subject is within this issue we're about to cover is a blueprint to save the world.
[02:10:33.581 --> 02:10:35.442]  Quite literally.
[02:10:35.442 --> 02:10:38.463]  Voting with your dollars, voting with your choices can change the world.
[02:10:38.463 --> 02:10:39.464]  I talk a lot about this.
[02:10:39.464 --> 02:10:46.127]  20 years ago, you couldn't find organic food but in novelty stores and mainly liberal areas.
[02:10:46.127 --> 02:10:49.148]  That's a positive thing that so-called liberals were into.
[02:10:50.493 --> 02:10:54.817]  Now it has basically begun to unseat even the mainline supermarkets.
[02:10:54.817 --> 02:11:06.950]  They're getting out the fructose corn syrup, the high fructose, shaming their GMO-free McDonald's as they're going to pull the torture chickens that live with all the antibiotics and all the garbage.
[02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:14.337]  They claim they're going to pull the bovine growth hormone and all the serious issues there that's banned in Europe out.
[02:11:15.845 --> 02:11:21.251]  I mean, every day I see major manufacturers, General Mills a few weeks ago said they're going to start moving out of all this.
[02:11:21.251 --> 02:11:29.000]  And that's because of the pressure you've put on them, I've put on them, countless others, the food bay, but nobody has been around for 20 plus years like Dr. Mercola.
[02:11:30.299 --> 02:11:33.001]  The very tip of the spear doing that.
[02:11:33.001 --> 02:11:45.250]  He also raised a lot of money through their organization to try to pass the initiative in multiple states where they outspent them 10 to 1 in most cases.
[02:11:45.250 --> 02:11:52.836]  Big Pharma, the genetic engineers, Monsanto to stop labeling, but still exposing it in that campaign just got people to start
[02:11:53.556 --> 02:11:59.878]  Doing even more research, and now you've seen McDonald's losing money, stores closing all over the place.
[02:11:59.878 --> 02:12:17.563]  If we can stop the frankenfoods, if we can stop the toxic drugging of Americans, if we can expose why we're the most unhealthy, the most obese, the highest diabetes, on and on and on, the highest breast cancer in the world, then we can reverse the entire other arms of this
[02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:27.653]  Dr. Joseph Mercola again joins us for the next 40 minutes or so and his website is Mercola.com and he's a medical doctor but holds other degrees as well.
[02:12:27.653 --> 02:12:28.755]  I'm not going to go into all that.
[02:12:28.755 --> 02:12:30.978]  Most of you know who he is.
[02:12:30.978 --> 02:12:34.223]  But he is a major game changer across the board.
[02:12:34.804 --> 02:12:36.625]  And it transcends the left-right paradigm.
[02:12:36.625 --> 02:12:57.038]  It's something that unifies us all together in health, in wellness, in sanity, in prosperity, in goodwill towards others, and in reclaiming our lives from a bunch of wild corporations that have gone wild who also want to shut down alternative medicine and alternative old-fashioned clean food.
[02:12:58.635 --> 02:13:02.278]  So it's not just that they want to push all their garbage on our kids and the rest of it.
[02:13:02.278 --> 02:13:09.743]  It's that they are seeking to monopolize the markets even further, especially now that the world turns against them.
[02:13:09.743 --> 02:13:10.864]  So the battle's joined.
[02:13:10.864 --> 02:13:17.189]  I wouldn't say we're winning, but we've come from being in a coma 20 years ago to now being awake.
[02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:18.570]  The sleeping giant is awake.
[02:13:18.570 --> 02:13:20.431]  What is the sleeping giant going to do now?
[02:13:20.431 --> 02:13:25.255]  And how will the Lillipally's, the corporate Lillipally's, how will these amoral
[02:13:28.695 --> 02:13:30.176]  Sociopaths respond.
[02:13:44.162 --> 02:13:46.484]  What they're not telling you about Monsanto's role in Ukraine.
[02:13:46.484 --> 02:13:48.206]  17 scientists speak out.
[02:13:48.206 --> 02:13:50.488]  Monsanto's roundup is cancer causing.
[02:13:50.488 --> 02:13:53.031]  The UN comes out and says it looks like that's happening.
[02:13:53.031 --> 02:13:53.651]  Huge win.
[02:13:53.651 --> 02:13:57.495]  Former Monsanto employee fired from major scientific journal's editor position.
[02:13:57.495 --> 02:13:58.956]  They've put their people everywhere.
[02:13:58.956 --> 02:14:02.319]  Monsanto's charts are flashing warning signals before their earnings.
[02:14:02.319 --> 02:14:03.661]  Monsanto faces roundup.
[02:14:04.713 --> 02:14:06.334]  Scrutiny ahead of earnings.
[02:14:06.334 --> 02:14:09.256]  Weed killer long cleared is doubted.
[02:14:09.256 --> 02:14:13.198]  Pesticide lobbyist refuses to drink glyphosate after claiming it's safe to drink.
[02:14:13.198 --> 02:14:15.780]  I mean, this is what we've got here with Dr. Mercola.
[02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:19.001]  I'm going to skip this network break coming up so we have more time with him.
[02:14:19.001 --> 02:14:21.123]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:14:21.123 --> 02:14:22.544]  I know you don't like the attention.
[02:14:22.544 --> 02:14:27.406]  You just want to be free, be healthy, and it's a win-win situation for everybody.
[02:14:27.406 --> 02:14:29.808]  But wow, you've got to be feeling really good right now.
[02:14:30.967 --> 02:14:33.830]  Well, it's exciting to be involved in the process.
[02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:41.376]  You know, the basic premise here is that you can ignore reality, but you can't ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.
[02:14:41.376 --> 02:14:50.905]  And that's why I'm so grateful to media sources like you that help counter the misinformation and deception that's going on on a regular basis.
[02:14:50.905 --> 02:14:52.006]  Absolutely, Dr. Mercola.
[02:14:52.006 --> 02:14:52.986]  Can you do me a favor?
[02:14:52.986 --> 02:14:55.028]  Can you turn your external mic down?
[02:14:55.028 --> 02:14:56.509]  I think your output's up a little high.
[02:14:56.509 --> 02:14:57.630]  Can you turn that down for me just a bit?
[02:14:57.630 --> 02:14:58.051]  Thank you, doctor.
[02:14:59.429 --> 02:15:00.430]  Oh, sure.
[02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:01.191]  Thank you so much.
[02:15:01.191 --> 02:15:02.091]  Again, Dr. Mercola.
[02:15:02.091 --> 02:15:06.695]  Mercola.com is our guest here today.
[02:15:06.695 --> 02:15:12.600]  And, of course, we carry a lot of his information at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:15.042]  Dr. Mercola, let me ask you this question.
[02:15:15.042 --> 02:15:16.563]  Where do you think we are in the fight?
[02:15:16.563 --> 02:15:20.687]  Do you concur with what I said earlier in that three-minute intro, or what can you add to that?
[02:15:21.843 --> 02:15:23.844]  I think we're making clear progress.
[02:15:23.844 --> 02:15:24.944]  I'm just adjusting my settings.
[02:15:24.944 --> 02:15:25.404]  Is that better?
[02:15:25.404 --> 02:15:26.524]  That's a lot better.
[02:15:26.524 --> 02:15:27.424]  Thank you.
[02:15:27.424 --> 02:15:28.105]  Okay.
[02:15:28.105 --> 02:15:32.766]  So, we're making clear progress.
[02:15:32.766 --> 02:15:37.987]  There's a long road to hoe, for sure, but there's more and more people who are being aware.
[02:15:37.987 --> 02:15:44.429]  On our site alone, we've had a 50% growth in visitors to our site, and last year we had 80 million unique visitors.
[02:15:45.129 --> 02:15:49.430]  So that we're getting the word out in the education component, there's no question.
[02:15:49.430 --> 02:16:09.514]  But, you know, when people come to our site, the challenge is that we give them these stories like the ones you just referenced, but it's difficult to integrate that all together to a foundational strategy to take that information and to integrate it into a plan that you can use to change your health, which is why I wrote a New York Times bestseller called Effortless Healing that's compiled this in a
[02:16:10.094 --> 02:16:12.137]  It's simple, easy to understand, practical plan.
[02:16:12.137 --> 02:16:12.538]  That's right.
[02:16:12.538 --> 02:16:14.801]  So it's one thing to just talk about the victories we've had.
[02:16:14.801 --> 02:16:17.104]  What about going to the mass of people?
[02:16:17.104 --> 02:16:18.126]  That's the reason you're on today.
[02:16:18.126 --> 02:16:19.247]  I forgot to mention it.
[02:16:19.247 --> 02:16:24.415]  Effortlesshealing.com, the new book about how you can quickly, easily change your life.
[02:16:26.035 --> 02:16:29.997]  Yes, by applying this information that's out there and easy to do.
[02:16:29.997 --> 02:16:31.538]  And I can give you a few examples.
[02:16:31.538 --> 02:16:35.120]  This is not necessarily information that people know about.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:40.143]  And one of the surprising ones in there is that sitting is the new smoking.
[02:16:41.565 --> 02:16:51.630]  And that sitting more than three to eight hours a day, like many of us do, can radically increase your risk for diseases like lung cancer.
[02:16:51.630 --> 02:16:54.952]  So it's just a simple strategy that you can intervene.
[02:16:54.952 --> 02:16:57.894]  There's more than 10,000 studies that show that this is a clear thing.
[02:16:57.894 --> 02:17:00.015]  That's why I'm standing now when I'm talking to you.
[02:17:00.015 --> 02:17:06.078]  But just simply sitting down will increase and rapidly accelerate your development of so many chronic diseases.
[02:17:06.078 --> 02:17:09.560]  And by the way, we're trying to go in that direction now where I have the crew
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:11.382]  That's great.
[02:17:11.382 --> 02:17:11.782]  Awesome.
[02:17:11.782 --> 02:17:12.062]  Really.
[02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:34.045]  Yeah, well, kudos to you because I've interviewed Dr. Levine, who is a researcher at Mayo Clinic, and he's a consultant for many Fortune 500 companies.
[02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:44.233]  And when they integrate this plan, they notice that not only do people, the employees of these businesses, feel better, their productivity goes up and their profit level of the corporation goes up.
[02:17:44.233 --> 02:17:46.154]  So it's a win-win-win all the way around.
[02:17:46.154 --> 02:17:50.197]  It doesn't really cost much except to maybe make the conversion to a stand-up desk.
[02:17:50.197 --> 02:17:54.881]  Well, that's why in the military, in the command centers, especially on ships, you stand up.
[02:17:55.681 --> 02:17:59.406]  For most of your watch because they found sitting down you turn into a vegetable.
[02:18:00.574 --> 02:18:06.079]  Yeah, it's something that, you know, it's not intuitive because many of us understand and appreciate the importance of exercise.
[02:18:06.079 --> 02:18:25.314]  And in the book, I go into the differences between regular exercise that most people do, which is the traditional cardio aerobics and the benefit of actually exercising in a more concentrated form in something that's called high-intensity exercises that you can cut your exercise time down by 80% or so and receive even more benefits.
[02:18:25.314 --> 02:18:29.377]  So simple changes that don't necessarily cost you anything, in fact, save you time, effort and money.
[02:18:29.517 --> 02:18:32.020]  Well I can't wait to read your book.
[02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:42.792]  Give us some of the more of the amazing tricks that folks don't know about because I mean I just learned the last few years about the standing thing and I've also just learned about the high-intensity workouts that are a lot quicker but more productive.
[02:18:42.792 --> 02:18:43.472]  What else is in there?
[02:18:44.002 --> 02:18:50.490]  There's so much information, but let me highlight on one that goes off of some of the articles that you just reviewed.
[02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:55.377]  One is the importance of our second brain and the connection to our primary brain.
[02:18:55.377 --> 02:18:58.120]  So you're saying, well, what is that connection?
[02:19:00.062 --> 02:19:05.968]  One of my big passions is to help eliminate the genetically modified foods in this country.
[02:19:05.968 --> 02:19:06.489]  Why?
[02:19:06.489 --> 02:19:09.531]  Because most of those foods are loaded with glyphosate.
[02:19:09.531 --> 02:19:10.692]  It's a poison.
[02:19:10.692 --> 02:19:17.679]  It's an herbicide that's sprayed to the tune of nearly a billion pounds every year worldwide.
[02:19:17.679 --> 02:19:21.703]  And the average person is consuming about 200 pounds of this food a year.
[02:19:21.703 --> 02:19:23.445]  And you say, so what?
[02:19:23.445 --> 02:19:24.445]  Well, this
[02:19:25.126 --> 02:19:29.768]  Chemical has been shown to be and proven to be a very potent bactericide.
[02:19:29.768 --> 02:19:31.888]  In other words, it kills many bacteria.
[02:19:31.888 --> 02:19:32.789]  So what?
[02:19:32.789 --> 02:19:37.550]  Well, it turns out we have a hundred trillion bacteria that mostly reside in our gut.
[02:19:37.550 --> 02:19:50.215]  And when you kill, selectively destroy large numbers of these beneficial bacteria, you also decrease these bacteria's ability to produce nutrients.
[02:19:51.135 --> 02:19:58.222]  Like there's 20 amino acids and a certain percentage of those are what we call essential amino acids, meaning our body can't make them.
[02:19:58.222 --> 02:20:01.064]  We rely on these bacteria to make them.
[02:20:01.064 --> 02:20:02.906]  And there's three aromatic amino acids.
[02:20:02.906 --> 02:20:06.870]  One is phenylalanine, the other is tyrosine, and the other is serotonin.
[02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:09.773]  I'm sure many of you, your listeners, have heard of serotonin.
[02:20:10.413 --> 02:20:17.799]  90, in fact 90% of the serotonin that's made in your gut, your body makes is made in your gut and not in your brain.
[02:20:17.799 --> 02:20:18.219]  Wow.
[02:20:18.219 --> 02:20:26.666]  So serotonin is a potent neurotransmitter, but it's also a precursor for another neurohormone called IGF-1, insulin glucose factor.
[02:20:26.666 --> 02:20:36.613]  So we have these factories of different bacteria that are in our gut, all this pesticide and garbage, herbicide, pesticide is in there killing them, and then I know from reading your literature and others...
[02:20:38.561 --> 02:20:39.302]  Pardon me?
[02:20:39.302 --> 02:20:40.623]  Most of us are eating it.
[02:20:40.623 --> 02:20:41.523]  Absolutely.
[02:20:41.523 --> 02:20:47.588]  Yeah, it's not because it's not labeled or not aware and it's in almost every processed food that they can purchase.
[02:20:47.588 --> 02:20:54.193]  Wow, and then is it true that then bad bacteria kind of replace them in that food chain in your gut?
[02:20:54.193 --> 02:20:55.074]  Yes.
[02:20:55.074 --> 02:20:57.636]  Nature abhors a void.
[02:20:57.636 --> 02:21:04.061]  So if you kill the beneficial bacteria, it's filled with the pathogenic disease-causing fungi, yeast, and viruses.
[02:21:05.154 --> 02:21:07.777]  Wow, please continue, this is incredible.
[02:21:07.777 --> 02:21:12.122]  Yeah, so now with the serotonin, so you radically decrease your serotonin.
[02:21:12.122 --> 02:21:16.187]  So what does serotonin, what does your body use serotonin to convert into?
[02:21:16.187 --> 02:21:17.769]  Tryptophan.
[02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:21.814]  Tryptophan is also an important component in serotonin for making melatonin.
[02:21:21.994 --> 02:21:22.634]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:21:41.994 --> 02:21:42.694]  I don't know.
[02:21:59.059 --> 02:21:59.179]  This
[02:22:15.385 --> 02:22:23.528]  I don't know if you had it on previous shows, but I believe last week the World Health Organization classified glyphosate as a class 2A carcinogen.
[02:22:23.528 --> 02:22:32.670]  It's a major strategy and a huge... That's right, they classified it, then Reuters and AP said, White Washington said, the UN says it may be a carcinogen.
[02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:33.951]  No, they said it's a carcinogen.
[02:22:34.585 --> 02:22:35.905]  Yeah, it is.
[02:22:35.905 --> 02:22:42.688]  And as the World Health Organization did a few years earlier and said the same thing about cell phone radiation was Class 2B.
[02:22:42.688 --> 02:22:48.970]  So these are pernicious influences that we all have an opportunity to relatively easily avoid.
[02:22:48.970 --> 02:23:00.094]  And that is, you know, it's a simple strategy and it's a win-win-win when people understand this and take their initiative to ideally grow your own food
[02:23:00.134 --> 02:23:00.434]  Thank you!
[02:23:18.397 --> 02:23:23.102]  12 to 24 and then plant them in a potting tray about 12 inches.
[02:23:23.102 --> 02:23:37.195]  Literally from time that seed to about 10 days, you can harvest sunflower seed sprouts that would cost you $7 a pound if you purchased them in the health food store, but you can grow them for like 10 sets a pound.
[02:23:37.195 --> 02:23:42.039]  And these sprouts, they're 30 times more nutrient dense than organic vegetables you can grow in your garden.
[02:23:42.079 --> 02:23:52.365]  This is literally a college education book on everything you've learned condensed in to really teach people things they can do to change their lives very quickly.
[02:23:52.365 --> 02:23:55.467]  I haven't read the book yet, but I know it's got amazing reviews.
[02:23:55.467 --> 02:23:57.949]  What about SSRIs since you mentioned those?
[02:23:57.949 --> 02:24:00.470]  Paul Watson wrote back on
[02:24:01.651 --> 02:24:19.439]  Friday, no, back on Thursday, guessing that the kamikaze pilot over in Europe that crashed in France was probably on SSRIs, what I've dubbed suicide mass murder pills, famously on Piers Morgan, their main sponsor I guess, was similar type SSRIs.
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:24.523]  Watson said that because, look, he was under mental health screening.
[02:24:24.523 --> 02:24:27.905]  He wasn't even supposed to really be flying, but didn't let him know about it.
[02:24:27.905 --> 02:24:36.611]  And then here he was, it turns out, New York Times by Sunday admitted, okay, he really was on SSRIs.
[02:24:36.611 --> 02:24:38.492]  What a shocker!
[02:24:38.492 --> 02:24:47.158]  Dr. Mercola, I mean, from your research, I mean, we even forced, as you know, the inserts in the last 10 years to admit it causes an increase in this.
[02:24:47.158 --> 02:24:49.239]  This is not deniable.
[02:24:49.239 --> 02:24:50.400]  What's going on with these?
[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:54.661]  Well, it's the strategy that these companies use.
[02:24:54.661 --> 02:25:00.563]  There are many people, tens of billions of people who are legitimately depressed through a whole variety of reasons.
[02:25:00.563 --> 02:25:02.783]  One of them is including eating GMO foods.
[02:25:02.783 --> 02:25:05.624]  But there's a lot of, obviously, external variables that cause depression.
[02:25:05.624 --> 02:25:08.525]  So there is a need for some solution.
[02:25:08.525 --> 02:25:11.466]  But Alex, you know what the S in SSRI stands for, right?
[02:25:14.978 --> 02:25:16.860]  I'm sorry, Dr. McCullough.
[02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:19.363]  The S in SSRI, you know what the S stands for?
[02:25:19.363 --> 02:25:20.704]  No, I don't.
[02:25:20.704 --> 02:25:22.506]  It stands for serotonin.
[02:25:22.506 --> 02:25:23.307]  Oh, of course, yes.
[02:25:23.307 --> 02:25:24.408]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[02:25:24.408 --> 02:25:25.349]  Oh, sure, I know what it stands for.
[02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:26.751]  Yeah, I thought it was a joke or something.
[02:25:26.751 --> 02:25:27.812]  No, no, no, it's not a joke.
[02:25:27.812 --> 02:25:29.434]  No, no, I thought you were going to say Satan or something.
[02:25:29.534 --> 02:25:32.016]  No, of course it's a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[02:25:32.016 --> 02:25:36.500]  The glyphosate actually selectively kills the bacteria that makes serotonin.
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:39.142]  90% of the serotonin is produced in our gut, not in our brain.
[02:25:39.142 --> 02:25:45.266]  So why the heck would anyone who's rational choose to take a pill to do this when they can just merely avoid...
[02:25:46.027 --> 02:25:55.750]  GMO foods and radically increase the amount of serotonin their body is producing to supply this important neurotransmitter and neuroregulator in our body.
[02:25:55.750 --> 02:26:09.514]  So there's simple strategies that you don't... Well, you eat food, the little bacteria have a meal as well, you then feel calm and happy, kind of get high off of it, but it's the normal healthy serotonin, not a chemical doing it in your brain artificially.
[02:26:10.074 --> 02:26:10.654]  Yes.
[02:26:10.654 --> 02:26:20.256]  And I just want to emphasize one thing too, because the big part of the book is designed to help instruct people how to improve and encourage the growth of this microbiome.
[02:26:20.256 --> 02:26:23.116]  And there's lots of conventional science that now supports this.
[02:26:23.116 --> 02:26:35.759]  So it's probably one of the single most important things you can do is avoid the use of sugars in processed foods, which will tend to decimate just like GMO, largely because they're typically contaminated with glyphosate.
[02:26:35.759 --> 02:26:38.319]  But avoid the processed foods and other industrial chemicals in all
[02:26:38.419 --> 02:26:43.363]  Always avoid the sugar, because it's like trying to stop your car with your foot on the accelerator and the gas pedal at the same time.
[02:26:43.363 --> 02:26:44.984]  It's really hard to do.
[02:26:44.984 --> 02:26:52.889]  You've got to take your foot off the gas, the gas in this case being the sugar which fertilizes the pathogenic disease-causing bacteria, virus, and fungi.
[02:26:52.889 --> 02:27:01.656]  So no sugar, and then you can inoculate your bacterial microbiome with beneficial bacteria like fermented vegetables.
[02:27:01.656 --> 02:27:03.277]  And we teach you how to make them in the book.
[02:27:03.897 --> 02:27:04.938]  Uh, simple and easy to do.
[02:27:04.938 --> 02:27:07.359]  We even have videos instructing people how to do that.
[02:27:07.359 --> 02:27:13.783]  And you could, again, go to the health food store and pay $20, $30 a quart for these, or you can make them for yourself for pennies.
[02:27:13.783 --> 02:27:16.764]  So it's, you know, it doesn't have to cost a lot of money.
[02:27:16.764 --> 02:27:20.966]  You know, there's a lot of arguments that people say, well, it's so expensive to eat organic and you're unhealthy.
[02:27:20.966 --> 02:27:23.608]  Well, not necessarily if you know what you're doing.
[02:27:23.608 --> 02:27:25.149]  Plus you're going to end up having so many...
[02:27:25.589 --> 02:27:33.057]  You're going to have so many health problems, you're going to be so depressed eating bioaccumulated toxins that GMO foods carry.
[02:27:33.057 --> 02:27:43.148]  Because folks don't understand, the GMO foods almost exclusively are meant to go with the pesticides and the glyphosates, so they're the ones that have the chemicals.
[02:27:44.022 --> 02:27:46.345]  So, I mean, past the debate of what else to do.
[02:28:00.956 --> 02:28:17.357]  Well, I've talked to a lot of police officers and EMTs in Texas, and they say, they told me one case in Houston, they pulled up the house, this beautiful trophy wife is up on the roof with a butcher knife cutting herself, and you know, had the kids locked up downstairs, and the cops knew immediately.
[02:28:18.058 --> 02:28:22.999]  Because she had no history of mental illness that they would find serotonin inhibitors in her house.
[02:28:22.999 --> 02:28:24.000]  Sure enough, they did.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:24.860]  It's every case.
[02:28:24.860 --> 02:28:32.802]  They say when they find somebody without a criminal record, who's never been in trouble, and is an adult, and suddenly goes crazy, they're always on these drugs.
[02:28:32.802 --> 02:28:33.762]  Always.
[02:28:33.762 --> 02:28:37.203]  I mean, it is at almost every mass shooter has been on them.
[02:28:37.203 --> 02:28:40.904]  And we were just showing the CNN headline where they were like,
[02:28:41.684 --> 02:28:43.985]  It was found in his apartment.
[02:28:43.985 --> 02:28:46.606]  Antidepressants found in co-pilot's apartment.
[02:28:46.606 --> 02:28:53.628]  So, the good news is, used to they try to hide this, now they have to admit that it is linked to things over and over again.
[02:28:53.628 --> 02:28:59.250]  I mean, ten years ago, Infowars.com pointed this out, like we did days before CNN, we would be laughed at.
[02:28:59.250 --> 02:29:00.551]  Now, people aren't laughing.
[02:29:00.551 --> 02:29:01.971]  That shows we've come a long way, Dr. McCullough.
[02:29:01.971 --> 02:29:04.752]  You're making a major difference, and thank you for all your efforts.
[02:29:04.752 --> 02:29:06.113]  We so greatly appreciate it, Alex.
[02:29:07.193 --> 02:29:09.295]  I'm just saying we're all having an effect.
[02:29:09.295 --> 02:29:19.322]  Listeners need to know the power they have with taking Mercola.com info, Infowars.com information, your new book, reading it, giving it to friends and family.
[02:29:19.322 --> 02:29:21.304]  This is how we're going to change the world.
[02:29:21.304 --> 02:29:22.004]  That's right.
[02:29:22.004 --> 02:29:29.049]  And you know, you mentioned the SSRIs and they are clearly a pernicious drug that in almost every single case there's a better alternative.
[02:29:29.049 --> 02:29:36.515]  But another broad class that's even more widely used are these statin drugs to lower cholesterol, which is an insane process.
[02:29:36.795 --> 02:29:44.966]  When we come back from this break, Dr. Joseph Mercola, Mercola.com, Effortless Healing.com is the site all about the new book that I'm going to read.
[02:29:44.966 --> 02:29:48.270]  Stay with us.
[02:29:48.270 --> 02:29:52.195]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.195 --> 02:29:54.859]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.196 --> 02:30:01.157]  Aging starts at the cellular level.
[02:30:01.157 --> 02:30:05.380]  When cells become toxic, they die early, and aging sets in.
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:09.843]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[02:30:09.843 --> 02:30:17.128]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[02:30:17.128 --> 02:30:24.633]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular
[02:30:24.633 --> 02:30:24.973]  I think so.
[02:30:51.463 --> 02:30:52.566]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[02:30:59.045 --> 02:31:08.709]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[02:31:08.709 --> 02:31:18.634]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies, the new oxy powder, available through InfoWars Life, was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[02:31:18.634 --> 02:31:21.555]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body.
[02:31:21.755 --> 02:31:22.376]  I think so.
[02:31:36.732 --> 02:31:36.972]  We're good.
[02:32:00.106 --> 02:32:01.447]  In the near future.
[02:32:01.447 --> 02:32:05.929]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:07.170]  Security, alert.
[02:32:07.170 --> 02:32:09.171]  This is Homeland Security.
[02:32:09.171 --> 02:32:12.873]  Analysis, InfoWars, building independent media operation.
[02:32:12.873 --> 02:32:17.756]  But the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[02:32:17.756 --> 02:32:20.337]  Prime Director, discredit Alex Jones.
[02:32:20.337 --> 02:32:23.179]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:32:23.179 --> 02:32:26.441]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called InfoWars.
[02:32:26.441 --> 02:32:28.602]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[02:32:29.062 --> 02:32:30.243]  People are assaulting us.
[02:32:30.243 --> 02:32:33.064]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[02:32:33.064 --> 02:32:35.025]  They're never going to stop.
[02:32:35.025 --> 02:32:39.087]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[02:32:42.688 --> 02:32:46.010]  Block free podcast and video feed.
[02:32:46.010 --> 02:32:47.010]  Imperative.
[02:32:47.010 --> 02:32:48.971]  Destroy Britain's limited TV.
[02:32:48.971 --> 02:32:53.574]  You gotta set your eye on the enemy, not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[02:32:53.574 --> 02:32:55.114]  Intellectually, it's begun.
[02:32:55.114 --> 02:32:55.855]  You can feel it.
[02:33:10.297 --> 02:33:13.858]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:13.858 --> 02:33:23.202]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:23.202 --> 02:33:29.444]  How on earth could you have a co-pilot of an aircraft who's on antidepressants?
[02:33:31.747 --> 02:33:37.011]  But how could you give pregnant women vaccines up until five, six years ago?
[02:33:37.011 --> 02:33:39.932]  The inserts said everyone knew you don't give a pregnant woman vaccines.
[02:33:39.932 --> 02:33:41.173]  Now they say no!
[02:33:41.173 --> 02:33:42.094]  Give them extra!
[02:33:42.094 --> 02:33:45.016]  I remember seeing that headline a couple years ago.
[02:33:45.016 --> 02:33:46.457]  Give pregnant women two shots!
[02:33:47.523 --> 02:33:47.923]  I don't know.
[02:34:07.219 --> 02:34:09.161]  I also have heard a lot of claims out there.
[02:34:09.161 --> 02:34:15.407]  I know that eating healthy and being natural and all this stuff can help with type 2 diabetes.
[02:34:15.407 --> 02:34:18.409]  I know that Ray Kurzweil claims he's reversed his.
[02:34:18.409 --> 02:34:20.551]  A lot of people say this.
[02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:28.318]  I've heard Huckabee ads, and I asked Dr. Wallach this last week when he was on, Huckabee ads claiming they can just totally cure it.
[02:34:28.318 --> 02:34:32.081]  I would never say that because, A, I don't know there's proof of that, but, I mean, B,
[02:34:34.602 --> 02:34:37.544]  The FDA would come after you, but we certainly hear that.
[02:34:37.544 --> 02:34:43.747]  But I want to talk about the real things we know about why is diabetes exploding, and then what can you do?
[02:34:43.747 --> 02:34:50.111]  Because there's a lot of evidence I have seen that if you do it early enough, there is a lot you can do to reverse it, but I don't think there's a silver bullet.
[02:34:50.111 --> 02:34:53.353]  In fact, before we get to statins, let's hit diabetes first.
[02:34:53.353 --> 02:34:54.434]  A, why is it exploding?
[02:34:54.434 --> 02:35:02.699]  And from your deep research, which I really trust, what is the truth, the scoop on managing and reversing type 2 diabetes?
[02:35:03.799 --> 02:35:12.827]  Well, I don't know that we can identify one specific variable as responsible for the explosion of diabetes, but there's a number of important factors.
[02:35:12.827 --> 02:35:23.477]  And one of them is one that I mentioned earlier, is this massive increase in the use of glyphosate to the tune of a billion pounds a year, because it kills the gut bacteria, gut bacteria responsible for producing tryptophan.
[02:35:24.518 --> 02:35:25.139]  Thank you!
[02:35:43.519 --> 02:35:45.380]  So it's the sedentary lifestyle that's big?
[02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:48.822]  Sedentary lifestyle, then processed foods is another huge factor.
[02:35:48.822 --> 02:35:51.603]  And the processed foods, of course, a subset of that would be sugar.
[02:35:51.603 --> 02:36:07.091]  But processed foods, I mean, the massive amounts of industrial chemicals and processing that goes into food, I mean, there's probably this, in addition to cutting out your sodas, and artificial soda is even worse than diet soda, or artificial sweeteners,
[02:36:09.532 --> 02:36:16.518]  This in replacing process was real for the simple strategy and you can in fact cure diabetes.
[02:36:16.518 --> 02:36:19.501]  There is type 2 diabetes, not type 1.
[02:36:19.501 --> 02:36:21.082]  Cure diabetes completely.
[02:36:21.082 --> 02:36:21.742]  There's no question.
[02:36:21.742 --> 02:36:22.323]  I've seen it.
[02:36:22.323 --> 02:36:25.646]  I've facilitated that process in so many people.
[02:36:25.646 --> 02:36:32.411]  But I, you know, there's people on your show that in the past have said that you can cure diabetes with a magic supplement.
[02:36:33.592 --> 02:36:37.614]  The supplement might be useful, but yes, I don't think any supplement is going to cure a disease.
[02:36:37.614 --> 02:36:48.420]  Ultimately, your body produces the disease and the mistake of using supplements is like it's the same allopathic strategy that traditional conventional medicine uses and that they have a drug to treat the symptoms.
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:55.742]  Well, I mean, supplements are better and they're typically less expensive and less dangerous, but they're not addressing the cause.
[02:36:55.742 --> 02:36:58.924]  We have to address the cause if we're going to make these problems disappear.
[02:36:58.924 --> 02:37:11.568]  And interestingly, there's this common denominator, this common thread with almost every single chronic degenerative illness, which includes not only diabetes, obesity, elevated cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease, stroke.
[02:37:12.168 --> 02:37:12.789]  Alzheimer's?
[02:37:12.789 --> 02:37:19.738]  Don't be sedentary, don't eat GMO, drink purified water, get sleep, but then also supplement.
[02:37:19.738 --> 02:37:22.943]  You need the supplements as the building blocks, but the healing comes from your body.
[02:37:23.866 --> 02:37:37.975]  Absolutely, and that's what I reviewed in my book, Effortless Healing, I review the strategies and how to do that, how to effortlessly, simply, easily, and cost-effectively integrate them into your life in a master plan.
[02:37:37.975 --> 02:37:51.585]  So, because it is a challenge, I mean, you can get the information, I mean, we have, you know, we've published tens, probably hundreds of thousands of articles on our site over the last 20 years, but, you know, it's hard to read those, understand them, and integrate into a plan.
[02:37:51.585 --> 02:37:52.485]  That's what we've done in this book.
[02:37:54.667 --> 02:37:59.551]  It's been 11 years since my last best time seller, which was the no-grain diet, which is years ahead of the time.
[02:37:59.551 --> 02:38:01.692]  Many copycat books have been out since then.
[02:38:01.692 --> 02:38:08.117]  But the initial strategy is limit your grains, not eliminate them in every one, because they can be healthy if you don't have insulin resistance.
[02:38:08.117 --> 02:38:15.883]  But if you have insulin resistance, as most of us do, then limiting grains and processed foods is a really useful strategy to improve your health, and dramatically.
[02:38:16.894 --> 02:38:18.735]  Yeah.
[02:38:18.735 --> 02:38:20.676]  It's pretty significant.
[02:38:20.676 --> 02:38:23.237]  It's so exciting because it doesn't have to be hard.
[02:38:23.237 --> 02:38:24.577]  It doesn't have to be complex.
[02:38:24.577 --> 02:38:26.878]  The tools are relatively simple.
[02:38:26.878 --> 02:38:39.264]  You just have to understand them and get the information so that you are built up and fortified against the misdirection and the deception and the fraud that is so pervasive in traditional media.
[02:38:40.024 --> 02:38:40.705]  Let's expand on that.
[02:38:40.705 --> 02:38:44.248]  It's only owned by six companies and you tell people about that all the time.
[02:38:44.248 --> 02:38:45.950]  So they control the media.
[02:38:45.950 --> 02:38:47.912]  And tomorrow I'm interviewing Cheryl Atkinson.
[02:38:47.912 --> 02:38:48.773]  I'm sure you remember her.
[02:38:48.773 --> 02:38:51.936]  She was CBS investigative reporter and wrote the book Stonewall.
[02:38:51.936 --> 02:38:58.843]  And she so cleverly reveals all the frauds and deception in the industry.
[02:38:58.843 --> 02:39:01.345]  And she's left it now, thankfully.
[02:39:01.345 --> 02:39:01.986]  It's amazing.
[02:39:01.986 --> 02:39:03.227]  Let's expand on...
[02:39:05.213 --> 02:39:20.523]  I mean, I've talked to so many medical doctors, brain surgeons, you name it, like Blaylock and others, they say literally your brain just rots when you take these and now they want to put them in the water supply or even make kids take them.
[02:39:20.523 --> 02:39:22.444]  Dr. Mercola, what's going on with the statins?
[02:39:23.244 --> 02:39:32.491]  Well, it's based on this flawed premise, the cholesterol hypothesis, which was started by Ancel Keys in the 50s, and literally persisted for more than half a century.
[02:39:32.491 --> 02:39:43.880]  And based on that, the pharmaceutical companies were able to develop a strategy that does indeed effectively lower cholesterol, lowers it very effectively.
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:45.822]  But does that necessarily mean it's good for you?
[02:39:45.822 --> 02:39:46.062]  No.
[02:39:46.062 --> 02:39:50.105]  Most of the studies show that it actually, you know, these studies, there's another
[02:39:50.345 --> 02:40:07.599]  Interesting book that I just finished last week called Doctored Data that gives people the tools to understand how to dissect these studies that are fraudulently presented as evidence of the efficacy of these strategies that are being recommended and prescribed on a regular basis.
[02:40:07.599 --> 02:40:14.885]  I don't know if you're aware of this Alex, but one in four Americans over the age of 40, one in four are taking statin drugs.
[02:40:15.385 --> 02:40:16.526]  It's insane!
[02:40:16.526 --> 02:40:18.849]  It's 25% of the population!
[02:40:18.849 --> 02:40:20.550]  They're giving them out like candy!
[02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:28.238]  And in almost none of those cases, very, very rare exception, even then you can make an argument that justifies not using them.
[02:40:28.238 --> 02:40:29.579]  They're just not needed.
[02:40:29.579 --> 02:40:32.022]  Because your body, it requires cholesterol.
[02:40:32.022 --> 02:40:33.844]  It's a normal part of the process to stay healthy.
[02:40:33.844 --> 02:40:35.786]  Isn't most of your brain made up of cholesterol?
[02:40:36.844 --> 02:40:37.684]  It's made up of fat.
[02:40:37.684 --> 02:40:42.345]  The majority of your brain is made up of fat, and cholesterol is a large portion of that.
[02:40:42.345 --> 02:40:57.129]  But, in fact, some of the studies that were used to support the benefit of lowering cholesterol, if you look at them more carefully and tease out the details, you'll find that the people with the highest cholesterol were people who lived the longest.
[02:40:57.129 --> 02:40:57.589]  I know.
[02:40:57.589 --> 02:40:58.389]  Especially with older.
[02:40:58.389 --> 02:40:59.809]  So, I mean, they've totally distorted it.
[02:40:59.809 --> 02:41:04.331]  My uncle was in a motorcycle accident and has epilepsy.
[02:41:04.331 --> 02:41:04.951]  I mean, 20 years ago.
[02:41:06.471 --> 02:41:11.356]  They told him, they knew, they said, start eating really fatty diets of these healthy fats.
[02:41:11.356 --> 02:41:18.384]  And his epilepsy got like 80% better because he just started, he was trying to do a non-fat diet or low-fat diet to be healthy.
[02:41:18.384 --> 02:41:21.808]  And then it was like, oh my God, his epilepsy got a lot better once he started eating fat.
[02:41:22.415 --> 02:41:29.140]  Well, there's a strategy called the ketogenic diet, which, you know, is useful for some diseases like intractable seizures.
[02:41:29.140 --> 02:41:42.671]  So when you go on healthy fats, not fried foods and bacon, but healthy fats like avocados, coconut oil, butter, egg yolks, macadamia nuts, almonds, not almonds, but pecans.
[02:41:42.671 --> 02:41:45.273]  So these are healthy fats that are low in protein.
[02:41:45.273 --> 02:41:47.275]  You know, and the other thing that the diabetic
[02:41:48.155 --> 02:41:50.397]  I think 20 is what Schwarzenegger would eat when he was world champion.
[02:42:12.233 --> 02:42:17.214]  Yeah, and that's fine if you're using it for a specific purpose like competitive bodybuilding, you could justify that.
[02:42:17.214 --> 02:42:23.896]  But the average person is not doing that, and their protein requirements are far closer to 50 than 150 grams a day.
[02:42:23.896 --> 02:42:28.718]  And excess of anything good is going to be a problem, including eggs.
[02:42:28.718 --> 02:42:29.738]  So they're great.
[02:42:29.738 --> 02:42:34.279]  I try to have a dozen or two dozen a week, but certainly not two dozen a day.
[02:42:34.279 --> 02:42:38.120]  You know, you've got to keep things in balance and perspective.
[02:42:38.120 --> 02:42:39.681]  Well, I'll tell you, what about alcohol?
[02:42:39.681 --> 02:42:40.601]  What's your view on alcohol?
[02:42:41.687 --> 02:42:42.948]  That's an interesting question.
[02:42:42.948 --> 02:42:50.671]  There's so much controversy on it because there's a lot of studies that show, especially red wine, that it's useful to decrease many diseases.
[02:42:50.671 --> 02:42:54.912]  Then there's other studies that say that alcohol in any amount is a problem.
[02:42:54.912 --> 02:43:08.338]  I think, you know, as long as it's part of a balanced diet, that you're really, you're not insulin resistant, you're eating lots of good vegetables, you're exercising, you're sleeping, you're doing a lot of things right, in moderation it's probably okay.
[02:43:08.338 --> 02:43:11.079]  So you add a couple glasses of red wine a week, probably good for you.
[02:43:11.499 --> 02:43:11.999]  It's probably.
[02:43:11.999 --> 02:43:13.880]  I don't know that it is good or good.
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:14.740]  It isn't good.
[02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:25.083]  But what I can be very confident of, if your other lifestyle strategies are healthy, then if it's not beneficial, your body can overcome that and compensate for it.
[02:43:25.083 --> 02:43:25.203]  Sure.
[02:43:25.203 --> 02:43:26.284]  What did you think of the UT study?
[02:43:26.284 --> 02:43:33.346]  It was a big one that came out last year, and it showed that people, A, that have, I think it was like two drinks a day.
[02:43:34.448 --> 02:43:35.508]  They had a higher IQ.
[02:43:35.508 --> 02:43:36.809]  I'm not saying it gave them a higher IQ.
[02:43:36.809 --> 02:43:40.150]  They just had a higher IQ, made more money, and lived longer.
[02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:51.973]  I don't recall a study, and as I said, these studies are so... You have to look at the funding source, how they did it, how they picked their... I think it was Anheuser-Busch, I'm joking.
[02:43:54.033 --> 02:44:06.756]  There's a whole social aspect to drinking alcohol, and being social itself and relationships is a strong variable in improving healthy lifespans.
[02:44:06.756 --> 02:44:13.018]  If you're increasing that component with the alcohol, then it may overcome that.
[02:44:13.018 --> 02:44:17.359]  Sure, so it's the having fun that might be making you live longer, not the drinking itself.
[02:44:17.659 --> 02:44:24.009]  Yeah, that is certainly a possibility, and I haven't studied it carefully enough to definitively give you an answer on that.
[02:44:24.009 --> 02:44:25.451]  Yeah, there's the University of Texas study.
[02:44:25.451 --> 02:44:27.674]  Moderate drinking helps middle-aged and older people live longer.
[02:44:27.674 --> 02:44:30.919]  Well, we can't believe anything from Texas.
[02:44:30.919 --> 02:44:32.382]  Especially me, yeah.
[02:44:33.533 --> 02:44:38.034]  No, I mean obviously it's moderation, but, and it probably varies person to person.
[02:44:38.034 --> 02:44:39.995]  We certainly know it's better than Prozac.
[02:44:39.995 --> 02:44:43.216]  What are some of the things that, I mean I've always read about studies with St.
[02:44:43.216 --> 02:44:46.897]  John's Wort is better than Prozac and double-blind studies.
[02:44:46.897 --> 02:44:49.418]  I mean, I think I read that on Mercola like 15 years ago.
[02:44:49.418 --> 02:44:50.198]  I refreshed my memory.
[02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:59.263]  Well, that's an herb that has been shown to be useful in the treatment of some problems of depression, and there are other herbal strategies.
[02:44:59.263 --> 02:45:03.024]  But if you rely on that alone, again, it's an allopathic approach.
[02:45:03.024 --> 02:45:04.284]  It's not treating the cause.
[02:45:04.284 --> 02:45:05.845]  You really need to treat the cause.
[02:45:05.845 --> 02:45:11.407]  And so many people nowadays eating 200 pounds of GMO-infested foods that are
[02:45:13.227 --> 02:45:25.771]  Massively decreasing your body's microbiome to produce this really important amino acid, tryptophan, that gets converted to serotonin, then you're really behind the eight ball.
[02:45:25.771 --> 02:45:31.173]  It's really difficult to catch up because 90% of the serotonin that's produced is produced in your gut.
[02:45:31.173 --> 02:45:33.734]  Sure, so it's falling into the same trap as...
[02:45:34.474 --> 02:45:34.995]  Thanks for watching!
[02:45:54.124 --> 02:45:56.749]  Alright, well, Dr. McCullough, I appreciate all your time today.
[02:45:56.749 --> 02:45:57.971]  I want to have you back in the near future.
[02:45:57.971 --> 02:46:00.836]  I want to read your book and carry it at infowarestore.com.
[02:46:00.836 --> 02:46:02.198]  Okay, let's make sure that happens.
[02:46:02.198 --> 02:46:03.660]  You bet, but everlosehealing.com.
[02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:04.943]  You're doing a great job.
[02:46:04.943 --> 02:46:06.425]  Really appreciate everything you're doing.
[02:46:06.425 --> 02:46:07.807]  Let me ask you this in closing.
[02:46:10.094 --> 02:46:18.259]  I mean, I'm not trying to hype this up and be a cheerleader here, because I've been pessimistic, but I'm seeing how big is it to have McDonald's basically going into a death spiral?
[02:46:18.259 --> 02:46:21.901]  How big is it to have them capitulating and saying they'll take a bunch of crap out?
[02:46:21.901 --> 02:46:28.445]  How big is it to everyday dryers, ice cream, major cereal makers, you name it, pulling garbage out?
[02:46:29.505 --> 02:46:33.028]  While they counter-attack and try to bring in regulations on media to shut us up.
[02:46:33.028 --> 02:46:41.154]  I think it's important, and I don't know if you saw, you probably did see it earlier this week, that they reported that diet sodas are down six percent.
[02:46:41.154 --> 02:46:41.494]  Huge.
[02:46:41.494 --> 02:46:42.115]  Six percent.
[02:46:42.115 --> 02:46:43.296]  I did the numbers on that.
[02:46:43.296 --> 02:46:46.918]  If you type in aspartame, our link comes up number two in the world.
[02:46:46.918 --> 02:46:55.305]  So we've been, you know how much, you know what that translates to in a lawsuit, the numbers, that they've lost ten billion dollars with a B, just from that six percent drop.
[02:46:55.985 --> 02:46:57.206]  So, we're making a difference.
[02:46:57.206 --> 02:46:58.167]  We're absolutely making a difference.
[02:46:58.167 --> 02:46:59.227]  People are reading the information.
[02:46:59.227 --> 02:47:00.008]  They're applying it.
[02:47:00.008 --> 02:47:01.469]  They're understanding it.
[02:47:01.469 --> 02:47:04.511]  And, you know, it's great that McDonald's is also in a downward spiral.
[02:47:04.511 --> 02:47:05.692]  They're having to capitulate.
[02:47:05.692 --> 02:47:15.740]  They're now putting, in two or three years, I believe, they made a commitment to only have chickens that were not given any antibiotics that were human-grade antibiotics.
[02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:18.842]  So, it's not the best thing, but it's certainly a major step in the right direction.
[02:47:19.142 --> 02:47:32.573]  Sure, well I remember hearing you 20 years ago talk about it, and other guests, how diet sodas actually make you fat, and now that's even ABC News, NBC News, we've always done, I mean Dr. Blaylock, we called my show 20 years ago.
[02:47:32.573 --> 02:47:34.294]  You know how they do it?
[02:47:34.294 --> 02:47:35.856]  You may not realize this.
[02:47:35.856 --> 02:47:38.698]  They mess up your gut microbiome!
[02:47:38.698 --> 02:47:40.339]  That's the trick, that's how it works.
[02:47:40.339 --> 02:47:44.623]  And it has this incredible dependency on your weight control.
[02:47:46.018 --> 02:47:57.305]  Well, Dr. Blaylock also says, as a brain surgeon looking at it, that it causes an excitotoxin effect so that it actually makes you hungrier somehow because of what the aspartame does.
[02:47:58.536 --> 02:48:07.958]  Yeah, it's definitely, there's many components to it, but the bottom line, any large study that looks at this will come to one conclusion, one closed conclusion only.
[02:48:07.958 --> 02:48:13.599]  People who drink diet soda are heavier, or diet anything, are gaining more weight than people who drink it.
[02:48:13.599 --> 02:48:25.502]  I always see the fattest people, the self-propelled stomachs, and I feel sorry for them because I've gotten really fat and lost most of it, I see the self-propelled stomachs out there and they always have a diet soda in their hand, almost always.
[02:48:26.581 --> 02:48:27.302]  That's sad.
[02:48:27.302 --> 02:48:31.986]  But we're making, again, diet sodas reported by this week down 6%.
[02:48:31.986 --> 02:48:33.867]  That's a great direction.
[02:48:33.867 --> 02:48:34.708]  6% in one year.
[02:48:34.708 --> 02:48:35.729]  That's a nose dive.
[02:48:35.729 --> 02:48:38.031]  Well, listen, Dr. Mercola, thank you so much for your time.
[02:48:38.031 --> 02:48:38.711]  You're doing a great job.
[02:48:38.711 --> 02:48:39.412]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:39.412 --> 02:48:40.353]  I appreciate all your help.
[02:48:40.353 --> 02:48:40.973]  Thank you.
[02:48:40.973 --> 02:48:42.755]  That guy is a legend, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:42.755 --> 02:48:44.617]  You talk about having a huge effect.
[02:48:44.617 --> 02:48:48.560]  He pioneered exposing the grains, the gluten.
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:50.302]  I mean, that guy's changed our world.
[02:48:50.962 --> 02:48:53.265]  It's just amazing to have people like that on the show.
[02:48:53.265 --> 02:48:55.969]  I'm so honored to have Dr. Mercola on the broadcast.
[02:48:55.969 --> 02:48:56.810]  Mercola.com.
[02:48:56.810 --> 02:48:57.311]  Get his book.
[02:48:57.311 --> 02:48:57.791]  I'm going to get it.
[02:48:57.791 --> 02:49:02.498]  In fact, tell Weldon Henson and our bookstore department I want to get that book.
[02:49:02.498 --> 02:49:03.579]  I want to carry that book.
[02:49:03.579 --> 02:49:05.241]  I want to push that book.
[02:49:05.241 --> 02:49:07.645]  And folks can buy it from us and support us as well.
[02:49:07.645 --> 02:49:08.285]  Support yourselves.
[02:49:09.366 --> 02:49:17.449]  I'm going to go to break, come back, take calls from Spencer, Dave, Chad, Julio, Todd, and others.
[02:49:17.449 --> 02:49:19.029]  I'll try to get to everybody in the two short segments.
[02:49:19.029 --> 02:49:24.111]  We'll have one final segment and then the overdrive segment.
[02:49:24.111 --> 02:49:25.352]  And I'm going to go talk to Nico.
[02:49:25.352 --> 02:49:28.873]  I keep forgetting to ask Nico, because I wanted to get him on last week, but I know he was busy.
[02:49:28.873 --> 02:49:36.836]  How are we doing on getting Strategic Relocation author Joel Skousen on?
[02:49:39.591 --> 02:49:40.372]  He was traveling.
[02:49:40.372 --> 02:49:41.532]  I'm going to get back with him.
[02:49:41.532 --> 02:49:42.032]  Okay, good.
[02:49:42.032 --> 02:49:50.177]  I want to just stay on that and nail him down because I want to get his take on what's happening with these military drills and all the rest of it and his take on the Russia situation and more.
[02:49:50.177 --> 02:49:52.238]  Thank you, Nico Acosta.
[02:49:52.238 --> 02:49:57.661]  Before I expand on that, this headset, just so everybody knows, has a short and is going out.
[02:49:57.661 --> 02:49:58.862]  So we'll need to retire it today.
[02:49:58.862 --> 02:49:59.802]  Thank you.
[02:49:59.802 --> 02:50:04.805]  I just say stuff when I'm live because I'll forget after I've got a break and I just need to get it out then.
[02:50:04.805 --> 02:50:07.127]  That's why you pretty much see behind the scenes here on air.
[02:50:08.258 --> 02:50:15.264]  30% off on DNA Force, the most high quality nutraceutical we've come out with to just clean out your cells, supercharge your body.
[02:50:15.264 --> 02:50:19.967]  The Bio PQQ, the CoQ10, super high levels, organic type.
[02:50:19.967 --> 02:50:26.192]  I think they were saying it's the equivalent, like two pills of this is like 50 boxes of blueberries or something.
[02:50:26.192 --> 02:50:27.634]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:50:28.419 --> 02:50:30.020]  It's redonkulous.
[02:50:30.020 --> 02:50:35.142]  The stuff in here that basically is better than vitamin C, that is the equivalent of like a truckload of vitamin C or something.
[02:50:35.142 --> 02:50:37.223]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:50:37.223 --> 02:50:39.644]  It's what the Japanese are all into.
[02:50:39.644 --> 02:50:41.345]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:50:41.345 --> 02:50:43.906]  Last chance, 70% that ends today.
[02:50:43.906 --> 02:50:45.087]  It'll end tomorrow morning.
[02:50:45.087 --> 02:50:49.769]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:50:49.769 --> 02:50:53.750]  And we are selling out of the Winter Sun vitamin D3 organic.
[02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:55.071]  That'll be sold out for a few weeks.
[02:50:55.071 --> 02:50:56.171]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:50:56.171 --> 02:50:57.052]  Thanks for the support.
[02:50:59.622 --> 02:51:00.403]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:51:00.403 --> 02:51:02.224]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:51:02.224 --> 02:51:03.866]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:51:03.866 --> 02:51:06.688]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:51:06.688 --> 02:51:08.990]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:51:08.990 --> 02:51:13.494]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:51:13.494 --> 02:51:17.437]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:51:17.437 --> 02:51:21.220]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[02:51:21.661 --> 02:51:23.282]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[02:51:29.297 --> 02:51:30.298]  Hey, Boomer!
[02:51:30.298 --> 02:51:33.740]  I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of water.
[02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:35.421]  Good thing we have the Berkey system.
[02:51:35.421 --> 02:51:37.362]  It's the cleanest, best water ever.
[02:51:37.362 --> 02:51:43.205]  Mom says it's because the Berkey filtration system cleans out the bad stuff and leaves only pure, delicious water.
[02:51:43.205 --> 02:51:44.046]  I know, right?
[02:51:44.046 --> 02:51:45.347]  You love it, too!
[02:51:45.347 --> 02:51:46.787]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too.
[02:51:46.787 --> 02:51:47.808]  Let's go get some!
[02:51:47.808 --> 02:51:49.569]  Get Berkey clean water by calling 877-886-3653.
[02:51:49.569 --> 02:51:49.909]  That's 877-886-3653.

[02:51:58.311 --> 02:52:01.153]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:52:01.153 --> 02:52:06.276]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:52:06.276 --> 02:52:14.402]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:52:14.402 --> 02:52:18.924]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:52:18.924 --> 02:52:22.727]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:52:22.887 --> 02:52:28.832]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:52:28.832 --> 02:52:31.995]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:52:31.995 --> 02:52:37.359]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:52:37.359 --> 02:52:45.546]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[02:52:45.546 --> 02:52:45.726]  That's 866-229-0927.

[02:52:57.914 --> 02:53:01.737]  Last year, in the Nevada desert, one family took a stand for freedom.
[02:53:01.737 --> 02:53:06.239]  Numana Food Storage was the first and only company to support the rights of the Bundys.
[02:53:06.239 --> 02:53:12.123]  While others stood down, Numana took donations and provided storable foods to the men at Bunkerville.
[02:53:12.623 --> 02:53:12.863]  I think.
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:36.763]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:53:36.763 --> 02:53:37.543]  This capitalism?
[02:53:37.543 --> 02:53:43.704]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:53:43.704 --> 02:53:47.405]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[02:53:47.405 --> 02:53:48.346]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.346 --> 02:53:49.406]  It's time to understand the system.
[02:53:49.406 --> 02:53:49.726]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:49.726 --> 02:53:50.066]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:53:59.502 --> 02:54:02.243]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:54:02.243 --> 02:54:07.485]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:07.485 --> 02:54:10.706]  I covered a lot of the news today, but there's a lot of it I didn't get to.
[02:54:10.706 --> 02:54:12.847]  I mean, whoa!
[02:54:12.847 --> 02:54:15.388]  Infowars.com story.
[02:54:15.388 --> 02:54:18.830]  Supreme Court affirms ruling that displaying U.S.
[02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:20.490]  flag is disruptive.
[02:54:20.490 --> 02:54:21.611]  It's politically incorrect.
[02:54:23.178 --> 02:54:31.701]  And basically says that if you're wearing an American flag, they can basically ban it because it's disruptive to the illegal aliens.
[02:54:31.701 --> 02:54:34.141]  So, there you go.
[02:54:34.141 --> 02:54:35.642]  Only in America.
[02:54:35.642 --> 02:54:39.343]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:54:39.343 --> 02:54:41.423]  This is the divide and conquer.
[02:54:41.423 --> 02:54:45.244]  That's the tolerance.
[02:54:45.244 --> 02:54:50.246]  Saudi's committing war crimes in Yemen as war on the Shia continues.
[02:54:51.638 --> 02:54:54.279]  Supreme Court affirms ruling, again what I just mentioned.
[02:54:54.279 --> 02:54:56.420]  Judge bans Constitution in Ohio.
[02:54:56.420 --> 02:55:01.942]  Laughs when defendant cites First Amendment and freedom of speech case.
[02:55:01.942 --> 02:55:03.862]  Just amazing how far we've fallen.
[02:55:03.862 --> 02:55:05.483]  InfoWars.com.
[02:55:05.483 --> 02:55:07.564]  But the good news is the word is getting out.
[02:55:07.564 --> 02:55:08.664]  People are starting to listen.
[02:55:08.664 --> 02:55:09.825]  The worm is starting to turn.
[02:55:09.825 --> 02:55:11.965]  Alright, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:55:11.965 --> 02:55:12.986]  Chad Washington.
[02:55:12.986 --> 02:55:16.207]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:55:16.207 --> 02:55:18.368]  Hey Alex.
[02:55:18.368 --> 02:55:19.088]  Your last guest
[02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:23.683]  What he had to say was great and all.
[02:55:23.683 --> 02:55:40.458]  I guess the only thing I'd want to add to that is we can all do our best to stay away from GMO and all the processed foods, but we can't stay away from all the geoengineering and spraying off the particles in the sky.
[02:55:40.458 --> 02:55:44.102]  I just want to know where you think they're really going with that.
[02:55:44.775 --> 02:55:48.918]  Well, there's a bunch of different secret programs to change the atmosphere, to manipulate populations.
[02:55:48.918 --> 02:55:50.339]  They admit the programs are going on.
[02:55:50.339 --> 02:55:53.621]  It's just that they won't release the specifics.
[02:55:53.621 --> 02:55:54.081]  That's what I mean.
[02:55:54.081 --> 02:55:55.522]  We're living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:55:55.522 --> 02:56:01.346]  They put chemicals in the water to manipulate our brains and write books admitting it.
[02:56:01.346 --> 02:56:02.547]  I don't know where it's all going.
[02:56:02.547 --> 02:56:03.328]  I mean, I know that
[02:56:04.238 --> 02:56:07.659]  NASA reports the Earth was 20% darker 15 years ago.
[02:56:07.659 --> 02:56:09.160]  Now they say it's 30% darker.
[02:56:09.160 --> 02:56:12.641]  I mean, they are, this is advanced.
[02:56:12.641 --> 02:56:16.903]  And notice, it doesn't matter who's in office, globally, it's the same policies move forward.
[02:56:16.903 --> 02:56:20.625]  It is a long-term strategic plan that's done incrementally.
[02:56:20.625 --> 02:56:21.805]  God bless you, Chad.
[02:56:21.805 --> 02:56:23.486]  Julio in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[02:56:23.486 --> 02:56:23.826]  Go ahead.
[02:56:25.578 --> 02:56:42.826]  On top of the morning, or top of the afternoon, Alex, you know, it's been interesting living out in Wyoming since June of last summer since I moved from Chicago, and a lot of people joke, the locals I've spoken to, I'm about three hours from Yellowstone, which is kind of a short drive in Wyoming terms.
[02:56:43.426 --> 02:56:54.478]  Uh, people joke about the large influx of Russian immigrants that live in and around Teton County, which is where Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons are located.
[02:56:54.478 --> 02:56:55.479]  I've been doing some research.
[02:56:55.479 --> 02:57:02.727]  I'm actually getting set to move to Cheyenne, the state capital where Warren Air Force Base is, and during this last hour I was doing some research.
[02:57:03.107 --> 02:57:05.568]  I came across a couple interesting things.
[02:57:05.568 --> 02:57:25.552]  One, recently, a few moments ago, there was a report of an investigation conducting Major General Michael Carey, is his name, there was a report done in October 2013, and it gets into how this Major General, he was a commander of the 20th Air Force Base at Warren Air Force Base.
[02:57:25.552 --> 02:57:26.172]  Okay, what did he say?
[02:57:26.172 --> 02:57:27.052]  Because we're almost out of time.
[02:57:28.183 --> 02:57:34.226]  Yeah, basically, he kind of went covert and was speaking to the Russians about Yellowstone National Park.
[02:57:34.226 --> 02:57:38.408]  I'm getting ready to read through this, but, you know, it's quite fascinating.
[02:57:38.408 --> 02:57:39.308]  I'll put it to you this way.
[02:57:39.308 --> 02:57:50.933]  The Russians wouldn't say this about attacking Yellowstone if things weren't getting really serious behind the scenes, stuff that even corporate media won't even discuss.
[02:57:50.933 --> 02:57:52.074]  That's just my take, really.
[02:57:52.074 --> 02:57:53.935]  The Russians wouldn't say that if things weren't
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:58:00.743]  To a pressure point that globalists are really putting us right on the edge of the cliff here, Alex.
[02:58:00.743 --> 02:58:03.845]  Well Julio is a reporter in his own right, working in radio.
[02:58:03.845 --> 02:58:05.006]  He's been a caller for years.
[02:58:05.006 --> 02:58:07.007]  He even filed some reports for us.
[02:58:07.007 --> 02:58:10.809]  Write a report up for us specifically on what the General said and what's going on.
[02:58:10.809 --> 02:58:12.089]  But yeah, he just joined us.
[02:58:12.089 --> 02:58:14.411]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[02:58:14.411 --> 02:58:18.253]  They have a Russian analyst who has the ear of Putin saying, you know, launch
[02:58:19.261 --> 02:58:24.846]  Sleeper cells with nukes to detonate them on the San Andreas Fault and the Super Volcano to take the U.S.
[02:58:24.846 --> 02:58:27.128]  out before they take Russia out.
[02:58:27.128 --> 02:58:29.430]  And it's just a dangerous escalation in the situation.
[02:58:29.430 --> 02:58:32.793]  But it doesn't matter because the globalists are invincible.
[02:58:32.793 --> 02:58:33.774]  That's at least what they think.
[02:58:33.774 --> 02:58:35.095]  Of course, they're not.
[02:58:35.095 --> 02:58:40.400]  We're going to go to break and come back in 70 seconds for internet listeners and fullworks.com forward slash show.
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:41.821]  Notley News Tonight, 7 o'clock central.

[03:00:01.613 --> 03:00:08.234]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.234 --> 03:00:11.215]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:11.215 --> 03:00:17.216]  We'll never turn this around unless we understand it's an orchestrated, synthetic takeover of reality.
[03:00:17.216 --> 03:00:26.717]  An attempt to end normal human activity, to build a world not designed for people, but for the technocrats who they believe have ascended to this godhood level that will merge the machines.
[03:00:26.717 --> 03:00:30.698]  They're megalomaniacs of the 10th order, and they've got to be dealt with.
[03:00:32.256 --> 03:00:35.097]  I believe in humanity and I believe we can take action.
[03:00:35.097 --> 03:00:37.498]  That's why I'm here.
[03:00:37.498 --> 03:00:42.100]  And we've got some good news, we've got some bad news, but overall we're in the fight and that's what matters.
[03:00:42.100 --> 03:00:43.961]  Todd in Florida, go ahead, thanks for holding.
[03:00:45.253 --> 03:00:46.554]  Hey, brother.
[03:00:46.554 --> 03:00:54.598]  Hey, um, when- the day after y'all broke that story about the missing nukes from Dias, I was on my way to North Alabama to see my best friend.
[03:00:54.598 --> 03:01:07.004]  I was on I-10, just about to get off and go- head north, and I looked across the interstate, and there it was, on a flatbed, a nuke, covered up in a heavy, white tarp.
[03:01:07.004 --> 03:01:12.947]  Fully exposed, except for the white tarp, and I've been in the military, and I've watched enough TV to know what the darn things look like.
[03:01:14.518 --> 03:01:16.700]  Um, it was headed east.
[03:01:16.700 --> 03:01:18.782]  That's all I can say about that.
[03:01:18.782 --> 03:01:29.190]  Also, a few days ago, a friend that I trust with my life came to me and he has a friend that's been in the CIA for 50 years.
[03:01:29.190 --> 03:01:40.960]  He said the man called him, they've been friends for 30 years, and told him to get up a month's worth of food and various other things which I won't go into because
[03:01:42.142 --> 03:01:48.366]  Someone is going to hit our power grid.
[03:01:48.366 --> 03:01:49.327]  Blam!
[03:01:49.327 --> 03:01:51.108]  Well, I know the power grid's wide open.
[03:01:51.108 --> 03:01:51.648]  God bless you.
[03:01:51.648 --> 03:01:52.629]  I appreciate your call.
[03:01:52.629 --> 03:01:57.232]  There's certainly massive preparations going on everywhere.
[03:01:57.232 --> 03:02:08.339]  And... It's just times like these that... I just hope we can get the public out of their coma to realize how much trouble we're in.
[03:02:08.339 --> 03:02:09.299]  Spencer in Canada.
[03:02:09.299 --> 03:02:09.659]  Go ahead.
[03:02:09.659 --> 03:02:10.220]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:11.516 --> 03:02:12.738]  Hi there Alex, how are you doing?
[03:02:12.738 --> 03:02:14.940]  Good, go ahead.
[03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:19.686]  So I have a former friend, before he was kicked out of Canada, he was in the U.S.
[03:02:19.686 --> 03:02:29.337]  military and he was an intelligence analyst and we had some drinks at a bar one night and he was a little drunk and he told me a lot of stuff about what he did in the Iraq war.
[03:02:30.178 --> 03:02:34.920]  One of them was he helped cover up the football player's death and do the cover story for that.
[03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:39.181]  But, you know, he also told me a lot of things about advanced weaponry and stuff that they would use over there.
[03:02:39.181 --> 03:02:48.224]  And you had mentioned earlier about the gay bomb, that that's actually 100% true, that they would use that and they would have large doses of hormones in it.
[03:02:48.224 --> 03:02:55.646]  And he laughed about it because he thought it was just so ridiculous, but he morally couldn't stand their actual operation over there.
[03:02:55.646 --> 03:02:58.467]  And he ended up deserting and came to Canada for
[03:02:59.428 --> 03:03:04.785]  Over 10 years and they finally actually just kicked him out because we don't apparently we don't believe in deserters here
[03:03:06.463 --> 03:03:31.310]  Yeah, so I kind of wanted to mention that and he also told me about how the CIA actually came to Toronto and actually kidnapped one of his friends who was also a deserter and they put a bag over his head and they tried to bring him across the United States-Canada border in Niagara Falls and they actually got stopped by Canadian Border Patrol and they had drawn their guns out at them and said, you know, like, you can't bring people over the border with a bag on their head.
[03:03:31.970 --> 03:03:39.396]  And there was a huge cover-up with that and they end up giving the deserter complete full Canadian citizenship in turn for not talking about it.
[03:03:39.396 --> 03:03:55.029]  But I just think it's absolutely ridiculous this power grab where the, you know, American military and the CIA and think that they... Listen, when they took Rob Due and crew to a military base, arrested the media at the G20, he won a lawsuit over it, settled it.
[03:03:55.029 --> 03:03:57.892]  They put bags on their heads.
[03:03:57.892 --> 03:04:00.374]  So, I mean, this country
[03:04:01.755 --> 03:04:02.996]  I don't think they put them on on dues here.
[03:04:02.996 --> 03:04:04.317]  They put them on who weren't even spitting.
[03:04:04.317 --> 03:04:06.839]  They were just putting bags over their heads.
[03:04:06.839 --> 03:04:12.022]  And I mean, this is the kind of stuff goes on because the cops all watch these shows.
[03:04:12.022 --> 03:04:16.025]  Based where it's an Al Qaeda guy, you put a bag on their head, but then it ends up being you.
[03:04:16.025 --> 03:04:17.826]  And then our government gives Al Qaeda weapons.
[03:04:17.826 --> 03:04:18.747]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:18.747 --> 03:04:19.627]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:19.627 --> 03:04:21.589]  I'm sorry to Dave, Chad, everybody else.
[03:04:21.589 --> 03:04:22.749]  I'm having surgery in the morning.
[03:04:22.749 --> 03:04:23.190]  Pray for me.
[03:04:24.462 --> 03:04:26.623]  It's not the very serious surgery, but you never know what goes on.
[03:04:26.623 --> 03:04:30.024]  And Lord willing, I'll be back in just a few days.
[03:04:30.024 --> 03:04:32.205]  David Knight's going to be here doing a great job.
