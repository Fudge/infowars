[00:00.000 --> 00:28.760]  We are live on this Tuesday, June 21st edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28.760 --> 00:34.520]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson. I will be with you for the first 30 minutes then Alex Jones will
[00:34.520 --> 00:39.280]  be hosting the show live so be sure and stay tuned for that.
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.920]  Now we're going to start by talking about violent crazy left-wing extremists because
[00:43.920 --> 00:50.000]  of course over the past five days the conservatives, the right, the pro-Brexit people in the United
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.440]  Kingdom have been blamed, have been lectured for the toxic and inflammatory atmosphere
[00:56.440 --> 01:02.800]  that they apparently created which led to the murder of the Labour MP Joe Cox.
[01:02.800 --> 01:07.720]  Now of course the polls were showing that Vote Leave was pulling ahead, the momentum
[01:07.720 --> 01:14.120]  was with the pro-Brexit camp. As soon as this murder happened that was reversed because
[01:14.120 --> 01:20.320]  they cashed in immediately. They blamed anyone who wanted to take back power from the unelected
[01:20.320 --> 01:25.480]  corrupt bureaucrats in Brussels. They blamed them for this murder. They characterized them
[01:25.480 --> 01:31.400]  as dangerous right-wing extremists. Well now last night it emerged that during a Donald
[01:31.400 --> 01:37.680]  Trump rally an illegal alien from the United Kingdom tried to grab the gun of a police
[01:37.680 --> 01:43.680]  officer and assassinate Donald Trump. Now I've been warning about this for at least
[01:43.680 --> 01:48.120]  three or four months in fact I put out a video three months ago called the assassination
[01:48.120 --> 01:56.640]  of Donald Trump predicting this very thing that dangerous left-wing violent rhetoric
[01:56.640 --> 02:03.120]  would lead to a crazy trying to actually attempt to assassinate Donald Trump and exactly that
[02:03.120 --> 02:09.240]  happened on Saturday night. This is out the American Mirror. Would be Trump assassinating
[02:09.240 --> 02:14.720]  an illegal alien. If one illegal alien had his wish he would have killed Donald Trump
[02:14.720 --> 02:20.720]  on Saturday. Michael Stephen Sanford appeared in a federal court in Las Vegas today two days
[02:20.720 --> 02:24.640]  after he was arrested for allegedly trying to grab a police officer's gun with the intent
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.600]  to assassinate the presumptive Republican nominee for president. Now bearing in mind
[02:29.600 --> 02:35.200]  that his parents and he wasn't political before this it was over the course of the last six
[02:35.200 --> 02:40.600]  months to a year that he allegedly planned this assassination attempt. This wasn't just
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.640]  a mindless tweet on Twitter. This wasn't a social media post. This was an actual plan
[02:46.640 --> 02:51.640]  to assassinate Donald Trump. He said that he had schemed it for a year. He traveled
[02:51.640 --> 02:57.440]  down he went to a firing range the day before to practice his shooting skills. Obviously
[02:57.440 --> 03:04.400]  it was a poor attempt but it was an actual assassination plot. So it remains to be seen
[03:04.400 --> 03:09.480]  what radicalized this individual to do this. His father said that he wasn't political
[03:09.480 --> 03:15.200]  but he was radicalized over the last 12 months. He doesn't know by what. Well I've got a
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.720]  pretty good clue. We're going to get more into it after the break but just for starters.
[03:19.720 --> 03:27.760]  You know Facebook for months and months hosting pages called I effing want to kill Donald Trump.
[03:27.760 --> 03:33.280]  Do you think that had anything to do with it? Do you think the hundreds the thousands
[03:33.280 --> 03:40.080]  of tweets on a daily basis saying I'm going to kill Donald Trump saying who's going to
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.600]  take one for the team and assassinate Donald Trump. Do you think that had anything to do
[03:44.600 --> 03:53.000]  with it? Do you think the rap songs the F Trump anthem the F Donald Trump song again heralded
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.720]  by the music media as brave protest anthems legitimized by the mainstream media. Do you
[04:00.720 --> 04:07.240]  think that had anything to do with the radicalization of this individual. I would say that it had
[04:07.240 --> 04:12.400]  a massive amount to do with it. And again this guy is a British citizen he was there
[04:12.400 --> 04:18.680]  for 18 months illegally in the United States for the last six months plus the last eight
[04:18.680 --> 04:25.000]  nine months in fact he's been hearing this constant drum beat of left wing violent radical
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.640]  rhetoric about how Donald Trump is a Nazi about how he's going to put you know Muslims
[04:30.640 --> 04:36.840]  in concentration camps about how he's literally Hitler. They've been hearing this for months
[04:36.840 --> 04:42.720]  and months and months. They've seen the mainstream media legitimize violent threats against Donald
[04:42.720 --> 04:48.360]  Trump. They've seen the press legitimize give a platform to the individual who rushed the
[04:48.360 --> 04:55.920]  stage and tried to tackle Trump back in March. That's what led to this crazy left wing violent
[04:55.920 --> 05:03.400]  rhetoric and it needs to be called out. We'll be back live on the Alex Jones show. Stay
[05:03.400 --> 05:05.720]  right there. New drone rules from the FAA limit small commercial drone operations to
[05:05.720 --> 05:13.320]  daylight hours and require operators to get certified every two years reports USA Today.
[05:13.320 --> 05:21.400]  The FAA's 624 page rule book allows commercial drones weighing up to 55 pounds to fly during
[05:21.400 --> 05:26.840]  daylight hours and lower than 400 feet in the air. The drone must remain within the
[05:26.840 --> 05:32.440]  site of the operator or an observer who is in communication with the operator. The operators
[05:32.440 --> 05:39.320]  must be at least 16 years old and pass an aeronautics test every 24 months for certification. An
[05:39.320 --> 05:45.000]  administrator for the agency said evening operations will be allowed if the drone carries
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.760]  lights visible for three miles and a waiver could be used for nighttime flights. You can

[07:02.960 --> 07:07.240]  generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss
[07:07.240 --> 07:12.480]  this important message. Here's why my friends, we already see major power grid problems and
[07:12.480 --> 07:17.480]  it's getting worse. So please listen, solar generators really do provide life saving electrical
[07:17.480 --> 07:23.120]  power and unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and produce
[07:23.120 --> 07:28.120]  electricity from the sun. Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil
[07:28.120 --> 07:31.880]  unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep. And
[07:31.880 --> 07:35.760]  here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from science has a big
[07:35.760 --> 07:40.800]  sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand
[07:40.800 --> 07:45.760]  dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners.
[07:45.760 --> 07:50.920]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to grid wars dot com. That's grid wars dot com.

[08:09.240 --> 08:16.240]  at half past ten, that baby of mine wouldn't let me in. So move it on over, move it on
[08:16.240 --> 08:22.040]  over. Go back live on the Alex Jones show on Tuesday, June 17th edition. Alex will be
[08:22.040 --> 08:26.880]  live on the air at the bottom of the hour. So be sure to stay tuned for that. Michael
[08:26.880 --> 08:32.800]  Stephen Sanford. This is the illegal alien, the British citizen that was in the United
[08:32.800 --> 08:41.080]  States illegally who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump during his event on Saturday.
[08:41.080 --> 08:47.680]  Sanford's only form of ID was the United Kingdom's driver's license reports RT. His
[08:47.680 --> 08:52.120]  arraignment on Monday, it was revealed that he had overstayed his visa and was in the
[08:52.120 --> 08:56.840]  United States illegally. In a court filing against the British National US Attorney
[08:56.840 --> 09:03.280]  Daniel Bogdan alleges Sanford had never fired a gun before until the day prior to the rally.
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.400]  According to police, he approached Las Vegas police department officer, Emile Jacob and
[09:07.400 --> 09:13.360]  attempted to take his weapon and use it to shoot Trump. The court filing states he drove
[09:13.360 --> 09:18.760]  from California to Nevada because, quote, he finally felt confident about trying it.
[09:18.760 --> 09:25.440]  He remains in custody and has a court hearing July 5th. So obviously the left wing press
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.880]  in America, left wing press in the United Kingdom, the same media outlets that demonized
[09:31.880 --> 09:38.680]  conservatives for the death of Joe Cox, the pro remain labor MP in the United Kingdom,
[09:38.680 --> 09:43.480]  who was murdered by somebody whose friends and neighbors said that he wasn't political.
[09:43.480 --> 09:48.440]  He suddenly apparently became political in recent months. Of course, they blame the
[09:48.440 --> 09:53.320]  right wing, they blame the conservatives for that. And yet this is not the only example
[09:53.320 --> 10:01.200]  of crazy left wing violent rhetoric leading to potential bloodshed. So we've got this
[10:01.200 --> 10:07.520]  guy who tried to assassinate Trump. And then today it's revealed that Omar Mateen, the
[10:07.520 --> 10:14.880]  Orlando pulse nightclub gunman was not only a registered Democrat, he supported Hillary
[10:14.880 --> 10:20.640]  Clinton. This is out the Washington Post. This is a conversation between Omar Mateen
[10:20.640 --> 10:26.200]  and his friend. They spoke to his friend. This is out the obstacle. Omar and I continue
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.320]  to have infrequent conversations over the next few years. I saw him at a dinner at his
[10:30.320 --> 10:36.240]  father's house in January. Of course, his father, the big Taliban fan, who the media
[10:36.240 --> 10:42.280]  treated as a credible source immediately after the attack when he said that it had nothing
[10:42.280 --> 10:46.960]  to do with Islam. The article goes on. We talked about the presidential election and
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.640]  debated our views of the candidates that were running. Again, this is a conversation between
[10:51.640 --> 10:59.880]  Omar Mateen and his friend. Quote, he liked Hillary Clinton. That's right. The gunman
[10:59.880 --> 11:07.240]  and the Orlando nightclub massacre was a big Hillary fan. He was a registered Democrat.
[11:07.240 --> 11:14.520]  Now will Hillary Clinton be asked over and over again by the mainstream media over the
[11:14.520 --> 11:21.520]  next three to four weeks to disavow Omar Mateen? Remember when David Duke came out and endorsed
[11:21.520 --> 11:28.040]  Donald Trump and Trump repeatedly had to address the question, even though he said from the
[11:28.040 --> 11:32.760]  very beginning he had nothing to do with him, didn't want his support. He was forced to
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.880]  disavow him over and over again because of course the press were trying to do guilt by
[11:36.880 --> 11:42.080]  association. So now we've got it on the record, according to one of his close friends, that
[11:42.080 --> 11:51.000]  Omar Mateen supported Hillary Clinton. He was a registered Democrat. Was he radicalized
[11:51.000 --> 11:58.680]  by some of this crazy left wing violent rhetoric? So again, you know, will Hillary suspend her
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.520]  campaign out of respect for the Orlando victims? This is what happened in the United Kingdom.
[12:03.520 --> 12:09.600]  The vote leave campaign suspended all campaigning in the aftermath of the murder of this left
[12:09.600 --> 12:16.600]  wing Labour MP. Of course, vote remain the pro-EU opposition said they were doing the
[12:16.600 --> 12:23.200]  same, suspending their campaign, except they didn't. They immediately went on the offensive
[12:23.200 --> 12:30.600]  and vociferously blamed conservatives who want to get out of the EU for this mental patient
[12:30.600 --> 12:36.120]  who was hooked up on psychotropic drugs for murdering this Labour MP. But again, Omar
[12:36.120 --> 12:42.040]  Mateen supported Hillary Clinton. Will Hillary suspend her campaign out of respect for the
[12:42.040 --> 12:49.880]  Orlando victims? Will she be asked to disavow her association since he endorsed her with
[12:49.880 --> 12:56.840]  Omar Mateen over and over again over the next few weeks? No. That's the answer. You won't
[12:56.840 --> 13:03.000]  hear it once. It's buried deep within this Washington Post article. And that's where
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.400]  it will remain because the left is terrified of this narrative coming out. Oh, and by the
[13:09.400 --> 13:18.280]  way, you remember on the same day it was reported when you had the Orlando attack, the very
[13:18.280 --> 13:23.800]  same day it was reported that an individual was caught with explosives with guns in his
[13:23.800 --> 13:31.280]  vehicle on the way to a gay pride march. Now, this was first reported. It was first rumoured
[13:31.280 --> 13:35.960]  that it was some kind of right wing radical. And this one kind of flew under the radar
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.520]  as well. It turns out that that individual who was caught with the guns with the explosives,
[13:40.520 --> 13:46.840]  presumably on the way to carry out some kind of massacre, was not a right wing extremist.
[13:46.840 --> 13:53.720]  He was a Bernie Sanders supporter. This is out of GotNews.com. The would-be West Hollywood
[13:53.720 --> 13:59.400]  shooter is a gun-toting weed-smoking conspiracy theorizing Bernie Bro. GotNews.com has learned.
[13:59.400 --> 14:05.680]  He's not a Trump fan or a racist as far as we can tell. So again, you had that story come
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.680]  out. As soon as it became apparent that he wasn't a dangerous right wing extremist, the
[14:12.680 --> 14:19.400]  story kind of disappeared. So now you've got three examples. You have the would-be Trump
[14:19.400 --> 14:26.720]  assassin. You have Omar Mateen. And you have this individual, James Werth Cowell, who was
[14:26.720 --> 14:31.040]  caught with the explosives with the guns on the way to the gay pride parade. All three
[14:31.040 --> 14:40.080]  of them left-wingers. All three of them potentially radicalized by violent left-wing rhetoric.
[14:40.080 --> 14:45.560]  Will you hear the mainstream media even mention it? Never mind. Tie it. Weave it into their
[14:45.560 --> 14:52.680]  narrative. No. It's too toxic for them to even acknowledge this thread. Now, there's
[14:52.680 --> 14:57.320]  an article in Breitbart. It was really good called, Did British MPs Radicalize the Man
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.040]  Who Tried to Murder Donald Trump? This is Raheem Cassan. The very top of the British
[15:02.040 --> 15:07.400]  political establishment has thought to link the murder of Joe Cox MP with the Brexit campaign,
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.820]  arguing against logic and potentially in contempt of court that the politics of hate and a
[15:12.820 --> 15:18.640]  UKIP poster with some are responsible. So by their logic, surely David Cameron, Jeremy
[15:18.640 --> 15:24.280]  Corbyn and their parliamentary colleagues will now take responsibility for the alleged attempted
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.040]  murder of Donald Trump by a British man. Now, remember the environment we've had for the
[15:29.040 --> 15:34.280]  past six, eight months in Britain? Donald Trump's a Nazi. Donald Trump's literally
[15:34.280 --> 15:40.400]  Hitler. Donald Trump wants to put Mexicans and Muslims in camps. You had the petition
[15:40.400 --> 15:46.600]  signed by hundreds of thousands of people to block Donald Trump from entering the United
[15:46.600 --> 15:51.760]  Kingdom. Now, they created that narrative that Donald Trump was somehow this dangerous
[15:51.760 --> 15:58.160]  violent extremist radical threat to democracy. So is it really any surprise that not only
[15:58.160 --> 16:05.480]  did we have the attendant violence that Donald Trump rallies, you know, people being attacked,
[16:05.480 --> 16:11.040]  spat on, punched in the face by violent left wingers? Of course, that was first blamed
[16:11.040 --> 16:19.040]  on Donald Trump. And now we have individuals acting out based on this rhetoric, including
[16:19.040 --> 16:25.680]  the would be assassin of Donald Trump. So in every single case, radicalized by violent
[16:25.680 --> 16:30.960]  left wing rhetoric, but you won't see the mainstream media point it out, because it
[16:30.960 --> 16:38.760]  completely demolishes their narrative. Now, we have another story out of NBC. This just
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.640]  broke about 30 minutes ago, three arrested with multiple loaded guns, knives, body armor
[16:43.640 --> 16:49.200]  at Holland Tunnel on way to New York City. Three people were arrested with multiple loaded
[16:49.200 --> 16:54.320]  guns, rifles and ballistic vests at the Holland Tunnel Tuesday when police stopped them for
[16:54.320 --> 16:59.720]  driving with a cracked windshield. Authorities tell NBC for New York three individuals, two
[16:59.720 --> 17:04.080]  men in their fifties and a woman in their thirties in her thirties, who maybe from Pennsylvania
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.480]  was stopped on the New Jersey side of the tunnel around 8am. So we wait to see more
[17:09.480 --> 17:14.880]  details on that. We don't know the identity. We don't know the motivation. But again, another
[17:14.880 --> 17:24.040]  incident in New York uncovered today as this climate of violent rhetoric escalates.
[17:24.040 --> 17:28.240]  Now one of the top stories up on info was dot com moderate muscle role model chopping
[17:28.240 --> 17:35.000]  heads off is the easiest solution. Of course, we featured the clip from Norway, where the
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.120]  Islamic speaker asks the Muslim crowd hundreds of people if they consider themselves to be
[17:41.120 --> 17:48.240]  moderate Muslims, they all do. And furthermore, if they consider the death penalty for homosexuality
[17:48.240 --> 17:55.080]  to be acceptable, as ascribed by the Quran and Allah, they all put their hands up and
[17:55.080 --> 18:00.160]  agree. These are supposed moderate Muslims agreeing that homosexuality should be punishable
[18:00.160 --> 18:06.680]  by death. Well, another clip has been uncovered of a so called moderate Muslim outlining the
[18:06.680 --> 18:15.760]  five ways in which homosexuals should be put to death under Islam. Here's the clip. If
[18:15.760 --> 18:26.600]  there's homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things. One, the easiest one may
[18:26.600 --> 18:43.640]  be chop their head off. Second, burn them to death. Third, throw them off a cliff. Fourth,
[18:43.640 --> 18:59.080]  tear down a wall on them so they die under that. Fifth, a combination of the above. We
[18:59.080 --> 19:03.760]  have a hot youth on that now. Whether somebody is going to accept that, that's up to the
[19:03.760 --> 19:11.680]  jurists to read and understand. There's definitely some of those applied now, maybe the combination.
[19:11.680 --> 19:19.240]  But this is something that's there. Now, you just heard the voice of Imam Hamza Sodghar.
[19:19.240 --> 19:25.360]  This is not an ISIS spokesman. This is an icon to young Muslims around the world. This
[19:25.360 --> 19:31.400]  is a supposed moderate Muslim giving you laying out the five ways in which homosexuals should
[19:31.400 --> 19:37.640]  be executed. Now, what happened after he made these comments? Well, he was invited to Sweden
[19:37.640 --> 19:46.240]  to preach to Muslim youth about Islamic jurisprudence and Islamic philosophy. He was given a platform
[19:46.240 --> 19:51.440]  after making these comments, calling for gays to be killed in all these horrific, horrible
[19:51.440 --> 19:55.920]  ways. We'll be back after the break to get into this, and more this is the Alex Jones
[19:55.920 --> 20:00.720]  Show Live Infowars.com. No, go away.

[23:29.640 --> 23:33.880]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year. Just this past August
[23:33.880 --> 23:38.320]  was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad. But boy was he stubborn.
[23:38.320 --> 23:43.480]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it.
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.480]  He wasn't a rich man by any means. At less than $107 per month, libertyoncall.org would
[23:48.480 --> 23:53.880]  have been the perfect alternative for my father. Don't wait. Go to libertyoncall.org right
[23:53.880 --> 23:58.880]  now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones. Again, that's libertyoncall.org.
[23:58.880 --> 24:21.200]  We are back. It's the Alex Jones Show. Live Alex Jones will be coming up live on the show.
[24:21.200 --> 24:28.600]  But first I want to direct you to infowarstheam.com. We've got the Lexapure Waterfilters 20% off
[24:28.600 --> 24:33.640]  infowarstheam.com for a limited time only from the super high quality, gravity-fed Alexa
[24:33.640 --> 24:39.880]  Pure Pro water filtration systems to shower filters. Now is the time to stock up for the
[24:39.880 --> 24:50.920]  lowest. Up to 99.999% of bacteria, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[24:50.920 --> 24:55.560]  You can even filter water from lakes, rivers, streams, wells, and of course municipal water.
[24:55.560 --> 25:00.760]  So again, get the products. Read the five-star reviews, the independent third-party reviews
[25:00.760 --> 25:07.400]  at infowarstheam.com, and it all goes to helping to grow this platform. The mainstream media
[25:07.400 --> 25:16.440]  is completely dominated by leftist, manipulative, deceptive rhetoric that fools people into
[25:16.440 --> 25:22.160]  voting for people like Hillary Clinton, that fools people into voting to remain in the
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.040]  European Union. That's why we need to grow our platform. It's come so far in such a short
[25:28.040 --> 25:32.920]  period of time. But again, the mainstream media is so unified in its message despite
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.920]  the fact that its influence is in decline. People trust the mainstream media less than
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.000]  ever before, but still, because they've got such a unified message because they've still
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.920]  got such big funding behind them, which we don't have. We don't have George Soros funding
[25:47.920 --> 25:53.600]  us. We don't have advertisements from massive transnational pharmaceutical companies. We
[25:53.600 --> 25:58.240]  only have your support. So it's vital that you get the products, and that's how you
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.480]  support us. That's how we're able to send people out to Bilderberg to all these Trump
[26:02.480 --> 26:10.280]  events to challenge the mainstream media narrative directly. So go to infowarstheam.com and support
[26:10.280 --> 26:11.280]  us today.
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.960]  Now, of course, before the break, we played the so-called moderate Muslim who thinks that
[26:15.960 --> 26:21.500]  gays should be dealt with by chopping their heads off. I'm sure he's going to get an
[26:21.500 --> 26:26.240]  invitation to the White House like Clockboy or something. I mean, listen to what he said.
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.280]  Chop their heads off, burn them to death, throw them off a cliff, tear down a wall on
[26:30.280 --> 26:35.720]  them so they die under that, or a combination of the above. Now, this is not a spokesman
[26:35.720 --> 26:41.600]  of ISIS. This is somebody who, according to the Muslim group of USA and Canada, is deemed
[26:41.600 --> 26:47.800]  a role model by young Muslims all around the world. This is a guy who speaks globally
[26:47.800 --> 26:53.440]  at international events. You know, he's linked in with some of the universities, and he's
[26:53.440 --> 26:58.800]  basically saying that, yes, it's in the Hadiths, it's in the Quran, this is how we deal with
[26:58.800 --> 27:06.360]  gay people. This is moderate Islam. Again, take a right to the heart of the point. After
[27:06.360 --> 27:13.200]  the Orlando shooting, we heard the usual rhetoric. Not all Muslims, this has nothing to do with
[27:13.200 --> 27:20.120]  Islam. Again, they even repeatedly quoted the Taliban-supporting father of Omar Mateen
[27:20.120 --> 27:25.560]  saying that it had nothing to do with Islam. He just wasn't happy at seeing two gay people
[27:25.560 --> 27:29.160]  kissing on the street. Even though it turned out he was gay himself, of course, he was
[27:29.160 --> 27:34.640]  a complete hypocrite. So again, we have moderate Muslims who played the clip out of Norway.
[27:34.640 --> 27:40.240]  Are you a moderate Muslim? They all put their hands up. Black, white, Arab, doesn't matter.
[27:40.240 --> 27:45.440]  Do you agree with the death penalty, pharmaceuticals? They all put their hands up. This is not an
[27:45.440 --> 27:51.800]  extremist fringe belief, as the media would have you believe it, as the politically correct
[27:51.800 --> 27:58.320]  left-wing apologist for Islam would have you believe it. And here's yet another example.
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.400]  Now on the subject of cultural enrichment, which of course we're enjoying across Europe
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.280]  right now. F the UK, hundreds of stone-throwing migrants
[28:07.280 --> 28:12.800]  force Calais to close as they try to board ferries to Britain in violent rampage as police
[28:12.800 --> 28:17.480]  via tear gas. This is out of the Daily Mail. Hundreds of enraged migrants cause chaos in
[28:17.480 --> 28:22.360]  Calais as they try to board ferries to the UK in a violent rampage. Police had to use
[28:22.360 --> 28:29.600]  tear gas on a 300-strong mob yesterday as they threw stones and attempted to board lorries.
[28:29.600 --> 28:33.660]  French authorities were forced to seal off the port as police erected barriers to contain
[28:33.660 --> 28:40.720]  the ferocious crowd, which was shouting F the UK. So while viciously, violently attempting
[28:40.720 --> 28:47.840]  to enter the UK on a daily basis to get benefits, to get free housing, to get free food, they're
[28:47.840 --> 28:56.160]  simultaneously chanting F the UK. Really grateful, aren't they? This is a great idea
[28:56.160 --> 29:02.760]  that we're going to allow potentially 12 million more of these individuals in if Turkey joins
[29:02.760 --> 29:10.280]  the EU later down the line. And recall, the left wing has not only embraced this, in some
[29:10.280 --> 29:15.480]  cases they're physically helping them come in. We've played the footage out of Calais,
[29:15.480 --> 29:20.720]  out of other areas on the border of France, where the so-called anti-fascist left wing
[29:20.720 --> 29:27.640]  are aiding the migrants. As they try to enter the United Kingdom, even as the police, you
[29:27.640 --> 29:33.120]  know, try to arrest them, they rush past them. They're not only verbally, rhetorically helping
[29:33.120 --> 29:38.920]  this invasion, this cultural enrichment, sorry, to be politically correct, they're physically
[29:38.920 --> 29:43.360]  doing so. Again, this is another reason why we need to get out of the EU, because we've
[29:43.360 --> 29:49.840]  got another 12 million plus coming. We'll be back next on the Ike's Jump Show, breaking
[29:49.840 --> 29:56.840]  here on the March, the M-Driars on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.800]  For an existing gun background check system, which needed 60 votes to pass, the final vote
[30:24.800 --> 30:31.440]  tally was 53 to 47. The second vote was on a measure by Senator Chris Murphy to expand
[30:31.440 --> 30:37.040]  gun background checks and close the so-called gun show loophole. The final vote tally was
[30:37.040 --> 30:43.440]  44 to 56. Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas pushed a measure that would allow the
[30:43.440 --> 30:49.720]  government to delay a gun sale to a suspected terrorist for 72 hours. It failed in a final
[30:49.720 --> 31:14.720]  vote of 53 to 47. You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[31:14.720 --> 31:19.680]  I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really
[31:19.680 --> 31:21.720]  wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brain Force right there,
[31:21.720 --> 31:25.760]  I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything just kind
[31:25.760 --> 31:30.720]  of clears up. It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it, find
[31:30.720 --> 31:35.320]  out why. Third party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does
[31:35.320 --> 31:40.560]  have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off. I haven't pulled an all-nighter
[31:40.560 --> 31:44.000]  like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force. I went
[31:44.000 --> 31:49.000]  home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.360]  and came in. You will find Brain Force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com

[33:14.800 --> 33:30.880]  On the Alex Jones show, Alex will be popping in this segment. This has just gone up on
[33:30.880 --> 33:39.080]  BBC News though. Headline, Jo Cox died for her views, her widow attains BBC. So not to
[33:39.080 --> 33:44.240]  downplay the tragedy of this, but they've literally wheeled out the widow. The husband
[33:44.240 --> 33:51.000]  of this pro-remain camp Labour MP to say that she died because of her political beliefs.
[33:51.000 --> 33:58.360]  Now, obviously the implication is anyone who votes to leave the EU is siding with the crazy
[33:58.360 --> 34:04.240]  radical right wing murderer. I mean, it's so transparent, it's unbelievable. For the
[34:04.240 --> 34:11.240]  past five days in the United Kingdom, we've had this constant drumbeat, this guilt trip
[34:11.240 --> 34:16.360]  that if you vote to leave the European Union, even though it has absolutely nothing to do
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.440]  with the actions of this one individual, this was a guy who was mentally ill. He was on
[34:21.440 --> 34:28.520]  psychotropic drugs. He used to scrub himself clean with brillo pads. He had obsessive compulsive
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.840]  disorder. What in the hell has that got to do with the fact that the EU makes 60% of
[34:34.840 --> 34:38.840]  our laws and regulations? What has that got to do with the fact that we're allowing in
[34:38.840 --> 34:46.840]  334,000 net immigrants into this country every single year? What has it got to do with the
[34:46.840 --> 34:54.720]  fact that fishermen in London, salmon grillers, are forced to comply with onerous EU regulations
[34:54.720 --> 35:01.640]  that bankrupt their companies to say that salmon contains fish on their packaging?
[35:01.640 --> 35:05.760]  What has it got to do with the fishermen that have been put out of business, that have had
[35:05.760 --> 35:12.160]  generations of their livelihoods ruined by these EU fishing quotas, which dictate that
[35:12.160 --> 35:20.440]  they can't even fish in British waters? But no, let's just focus on one demented lunatic
[35:20.440 --> 35:25.120]  who liked to scrub himself with brillo pads, because that's suddenly what the debate is
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.520]  all about. So now the widow, I mean, he was out immediately, but they've wheeled him out
[35:30.520 --> 35:40.040]  once again. The funeral of Joe Cox is tomorrow, the day before the referendum vote. Shameful,
[35:40.040 --> 35:46.600]  absolutely shameful exploitation of this woman's death for political grit when they said, we're
[35:46.600 --> 35:52.040]  going to suspend the campaigns. We're not going to talk politics. They immediately blamed
[35:52.040 --> 35:59.040]  it on the vote leave camp. So again, I mean, it was it was project fear all along. It was
[35:59.040 --> 36:03.880]  David Cameron saying, we're going to have World War three. If we leave the EU, there's
[36:03.880 --> 36:09.360]  going to be an economic Armageddon even said that the leader of ISIS would support Britain
[36:09.360 --> 36:15.320]  leaving the EU. That didn't work. The polls were beginning to shift over to vote leave
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.440]  again. At one stage vote remain, you know, they were 1013 points ahead back a few months
[36:20.440 --> 36:26.920]  ago. Those polls completely reversed. At one point there was a poll that showed vote leave
[36:26.920 --> 36:35.800]  13 points ahead. Again, most polls before that incident showed that vote leave was ahead.
[36:35.800 --> 36:41.080]  They also had the momentum. They were on top of the argument because everybody had got
[36:41.080 --> 36:48.720]  sick to the back teeth of project fear. So they turned project fear into project grief.
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.800]  And of course, this is the same crowd, the very same crowd. For example, that when a
[36:54.800 --> 37:01.520]  Muslim man attacked bystanders with a knife at a tube station in London back, I believe
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.640]  it was in December. What was the hashtag? What was the narrative that came out in the
[37:06.640 --> 37:13.920]  media aftermath? It was you ain't no Muslim, brov. Again, the first thing they did was
[37:13.920 --> 37:19.320]  to extricate this from blaming all Muslims, because you can't blame all Muslims for a
[37:19.320 --> 37:24.480]  terrorist attack. That's bigoted. That's racist. But you can blame all people who want to get
[37:24.480 --> 37:29.440]  out the European Union for the actions of one demented lunatic who like to scrub himself
[37:29.440 --> 37:37.120]  clean with brillo pads. Again, if the left's doing it, it's perfectly fine. So again, now
[37:37.120 --> 37:44.400]  we've got stories about the memos. From the vote remain the stronger in Europe director
[37:44.400 --> 37:51.040]  remain campaign director will straw who sent an email. Again, this was on Saturday, just
[37:51.040 --> 37:57.000]  a couple of days after the murder of Joe Cox saying that voters had been quote pulled up
[37:57.000 --> 38:02.280]  short by the murder of Joe Cox and that stronger in that's the campaign to remain in Europe
[38:02.280 --> 38:07.640]  should now attack the leaf side for creating quote division and resentment. Now, of course,
[38:07.640 --> 38:13.560]  whenever you hear leftist talk about division, they're really talking about people who have
[38:13.560 --> 38:22.160]  the sheer to merit to stand by their principles. So after they told the public and after vote
[38:22.160 --> 38:26.720]  leave and relented and kind of back down and become a little weak on this because they
[38:26.720 --> 38:31.840]  didn't want to be seen as insensitive, they said we're going to suspend the campaigns.
[38:31.840 --> 38:36.320]  Even though the leaflets kept coming, you know, I had a leaflet the very next day, they
[38:36.320 --> 38:42.800]  didn't suspend their campaign. They went even more on the offensive, trying to frame this
[38:42.800 --> 38:49.880]  as being the fault of people who want to leave the EU. But again, you won't see that with
[38:49.880 --> 38:57.720]  the would be Trump assassin. Again, this illegal alien British citizen. Been planning this,
[38:57.720 --> 39:03.920]  you know, for a year, radicalized by the rhetoric, Trump's a Nazi, Trump's a fascist. Stop Trump
[39:03.920 --> 39:09.400]  from entering the UK. He's going to put all Muslims in concentration camps. He's going
[39:09.400 --> 39:16.120]  to deport Mexican people. They believe that. And all you had to do every day for the past
[39:16.120 --> 39:22.280]  12 months is go on Twitter and search for kill Trump assassinate Trump. You can go on
[39:22.280 --> 39:29.360]  there right now and do it every single day. Death threat after death threat. I mean, this
[39:29.360 --> 39:35.040]  is what caused Trump back in October last year, you know, to get secret service protection.
[39:35.040 --> 39:40.160]  He wears a bulletproof vest at all his public events. That's why he doesn't do his jacket
[39:40.160 --> 39:47.680]  up because of the way of this bulletproof vest. And it was, you know, it's perfectly reasonable.
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.760]  An onslaught of death threats, but not only death threats from crazed individuals on Twitter
[39:52.760 --> 39:59.680]  and ones who actually plan to go through with it as we saw on Saturday. But again, the legitimization
[39:59.680 --> 40:07.120]  of this through the media, you saw after Ferguson Time magazine in defense of rioting, they
[40:07.120 --> 40:13.160]  legitimize violence so long as it's on the left. But God forbid you would have a situation
[40:13.160 --> 40:19.120]  like we had with, you know, the the seizure there in Oregon of the property. That's violent
[40:19.120 --> 40:26.080]  right wing. That's dangerous, completely castigated by the media. But when it happens in places
[40:26.080 --> 40:32.280]  like Ferguson, it's legitimized. When the guy rushed the stage, remember the famous
[40:32.280 --> 40:37.320]  incident where the secret service had to grab him and, you know, protect Donald Trump? What
[40:37.320 --> 40:43.600]  happened? Was he denounced? No, he was given a platform. He was on CNN the very next day.
[40:43.600 --> 40:50.840]  Again, arguing that this was completely justified and legitimate because he was basing it on
[40:50.840 --> 40:57.800]  the narrative, what he had heard about the danger that Donald Trump posed to democracy,
[40:57.800 --> 41:04.040]  to Muslims, to Mexicans, of course, completely exaggerated, completely overblown. But this
[41:04.040 --> 41:10.800]  is the process of violent left wing radicalization that led to the incident on Saturday night
[41:10.800 --> 41:18.520]  where this guy tried to grab a police officer's gun and tried to shoot Donald Trump. And again,
[41:18.520 --> 41:25.240]  this is not a top story. This is just in the background. This is still bubbling along.
[41:25.240 --> 41:30.280]  And of course, we go back to the numerous reports we've made over and over again. Facebook
[41:30.280 --> 41:37.040]  removed, refusing to remove pages called I effing want to kill Donald Trump. We had top
[41:37.040 --> 41:44.040]  rappers. We had YG and Nipsey Hussle, you know, performing in front of 20,000 people
[41:44.040 --> 41:50.640]  at the Coachella Music Festival. A rap song, you know, which openly invokes death threats
[41:50.640 --> 41:56.920]  and vows to stage riots if Trump wins the president presidency. Was it denounced? No,
[41:56.920 --> 42:04.480]  it was hailed. Billboard.com, the source, MTV, every single one of them hailed it as
[42:04.480 --> 42:12.200]  this glorious protest anthem. You had the F. Donald Trump's anthem again, heralded as
[42:12.200 --> 42:18.840]  a viral protest song by Sectors of the Music Media. Go and listen to the lyrics of this
[42:18.840 --> 42:25.080]  song. I mean, it was on YouTube for months. I don't even know if they deleted it. Again,
[42:25.080 --> 42:33.120]  this is the process of violent left wing radicalization. But it's never covered from the leftist perspective
[42:33.120 --> 42:36.960]  because they can't allow that to get out. That's why they blame the violence that the
[42:36.960 --> 42:44.520]  Trump rallies on Donald Trump. Again, for months until, you know, the volume of footage
[42:44.520 --> 42:50.440]  was so overwhelming that they had to back away from that. Seeing a similar process in
[42:50.440 --> 42:57.720]  the UK. This is out of LBC with regard to Brexit headline. I was called racist for handing
[42:57.720 --> 43:04.120]  out leave leaflets. Now, these were black people who were handing out leaflets for
[43:04.120 --> 43:10.440]  vote leave in the United Kingdom. This is what they said yesterday. I was called racist
[43:10.440 --> 43:16.560]  all day. I was called a Nazi. My friend has had his thoughts stamped on. It was scary.
[43:16.560 --> 43:22.040]  We had our stall kicked, punched. We had leaflets taken from the table. Someone tried to knock
[43:22.040 --> 43:27.400]  the table over. The weird thing is I'm half Caribbean and my friend is Jamaican. All these
[43:27.400 --> 43:32.440]  people over the course of the day, every single person, every single person who called us
[43:32.440 --> 43:38.040]  a racist or a Nazi, and there were many, we're all white middle class people. Well, what
[43:38.040 --> 43:45.280]  do you know? Again, they're so concerned about minorities, but not if they're conservatives,
[43:45.280 --> 43:53.600]  then they can go to hell. Again, stamped on a tact called Nazis, simply for campaigning
[43:53.600 --> 44:00.280]  for a political position which is held by, you know, virtually half of the country. Paul,
[44:00.280 --> 44:05.480]  sitting back watching you do a great job here, co-hosting with me today. I'm going to take
[44:05.480 --> 44:09.880]  over for the balance of the transmission now, but I really love having these mixed broadcasts
[44:09.880 --> 44:14.960]  where David Knight's on, you're on, I'm on. I'm having a workcation here with the family
[44:14.960 --> 44:21.160]  down in the Gulf of Mexico slash Caribbean fishing, enjoying the bounties of God's world
[44:21.160 --> 44:25.240]  and a little bit of freedom we have left, but here listening to you break all this down.
[44:25.240 --> 44:30.000]  And I know it's only a fraction of the evidence we have, even though it's voluminous. This
[44:30.000 --> 44:34.960]  voluminous mountain is only a grain of sand of the corruption and the ignorance. And it
[44:34.960 --> 44:41.840]  is the dumbed down nature of the general public. That is the ocean in which this corruption
[44:41.840 --> 44:46.240]  swims. And when you've got people that are so dumbed down, they just think if they go
[44:46.240 --> 44:52.320]  with mainstream media, go with the latest fad, the latest fraud, the latest hype, they're
[44:52.320 --> 44:58.880]  going to get ahead. Like this Stephen Stanford, 19 from England, didn't have a job, basically
[44:58.880 --> 45:06.320]  living off welfare here illegally, a big leftist. And he thought he would be such a hero getting
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.280]  caught up in all the hype that he would go to a shooting range, learn how to use a gun,
[45:11.280 --> 45:16.640]  but couldn't buy one. So went and then try to steal a police officer's firearm. And it
[45:16.640 --> 45:21.360]  took two days for us to even learn that this guy had been arrested. And he was finally
[45:21.360 --> 45:27.160]  obviously indicted in federal court yesterday. And this is illustrative of how they are pushing
[45:27.160 --> 45:32.200]  the mass of these zombies to go out and engage in these attacks. And then the New York Times
[45:32.200 --> 45:38.720]  and the Daily Beast and everybody else can just sit back and act like they are completely
[45:38.720 --> 45:43.360]  ignorant to why any of this is happening, why any of this is unfolding. But it really
[45:43.360 --> 45:51.120]  is this triumph of ignorance over substance where you have Donald Trump who's always been
[45:51.120 --> 45:57.320]  equal rights for everybody who was giving interviews back in 1993, 2000, you name it
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.120]  with the advocate. You've got Donald Trump who's advanced women minorities, you name
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.040]  it in every position, more than anybody else in this industry. You've got a guy saying
[46:06.040 --> 46:10.920]  Saudi Arabia doesn't take one refugee. They started the civil war in Syria. We should
[46:10.920 --> 46:14.880]  vet these people before they're allowed to come in. And the response is to have people
[46:14.880 --> 46:19.680]  running around with rainbow flag screaming. He hates gay people and he wants to kill the
[46:19.680 --> 46:25.640]  Muslims or ship them all back to whatever. It just shows how we have been totally trained
[46:25.640 --> 46:32.120]  to submit to the popular meme. And if you look at who goes along with mainstream media,
[46:32.120 --> 46:37.280]  they have the lowest income. They're the most ignorant people. They're young. They're stupid.
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.000]  They're foolish. And they just believe if they follow these narratives to go get two
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.360]  or three college degrees or they follow the narrative of adopting some lifestyle that
[46:47.360 --> 46:51.120]  the media says to, or they just follow the narrative of go out and kill Donald Trump,
[46:51.120 --> 46:55.520]  but somehow they'll be fulfilled. No, he'll just probably serve five or 10 years in a
[46:55.520 --> 47:00.560]  federal prison or be deported back to England. But it's so classic, the mental illness of
[47:00.560 --> 47:06.600]  an illegal alien from England here, demanding everything free and literally whacked out
[47:06.600 --> 47:12.960]  wanting to kill a presidential candidate because he's a Nazi. This shows the entitlement when
[47:12.960 --> 47:18.800]  I can't go to Russia. I can't go to China. I can't go to Mexico. I can't go to Brazil.
[47:18.800 --> 47:24.880]  I can't go to Nigeria. I can't go to anywhere in the world and try to ask for free stuff.
[47:24.880 --> 47:29.120]  I'd be in prison. I'd be beat up. I'd be thrown out on the street. I'd be deported. But only
[47:29.120 --> 47:36.040]  here do we have this mass mental illness and then all of these weirdo, entitled people
[47:36.040 --> 47:41.080]  that absolutely think that we're their mortal enemies. If we don't just give them everything
[47:41.080 --> 47:46.000]  and give them everything now and like giant trigly puffs, armies of trigly puffs, armies
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.920]  of social justice warriors totally entitled, they're not learning how to write, how to
[47:49.920 --> 47:54.600]  read, how to be good at business, how to be charming, how to work hard, how to be competitive,
[47:54.600 --> 47:58.920]  how to be creative, how to be innovative. They're learning how to bitch and complain
[47:58.920 --> 48:05.080]  and whine like toddlers and organize themselves into big giant groups of people parroting the
[48:05.080 --> 48:10.040]  same slogans mindlessly believing somehow they're going to get ahead by doing this. This is
[48:10.040 --> 48:14.400]  what social engineering does. This is what the end of the family does. This is what it
[48:14.400 --> 48:19.000]  delivers us and it'd be bad enough. We know societies tend to slouch towards Gomorrah
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.240]  to quote the late judge William Bork, but the globalist are greasing the skids towards
[48:23.240 --> 48:28.960]  Gomorrah for us to enter the most decadent cycle possible while cutting off resources
[48:28.960 --> 48:34.960]  at the same time, organizing a societal global collapse that is known as agenda 21, agenda
[48:34.960 --> 48:38.760]  2030. We're exposing so we're going to break and I'm going to come back and take over and
[48:38.760 --> 48:45.240]  talk about all this breaking news. But first, Paul, the British exit, the Brexit, it's here.
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.280]  Give people the time frame, your 20 minute reports up on Facebook, Twitter, at realalexshows.
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.840]  It's on infowars.com. Required viewing for anybody that wants to understand that globalism
[48:53.840 --> 48:59.000]  is in big trouble, but it's failing forward trying to gobble up and declare all these
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.920]  unconstitutional anti-human rights. Here we are with world government out in the open.
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.120]  We're going to skip this break. Here we are with planetary regimes in our face. Here we
[49:08.120 --> 49:12.880]  are with admitted geoengineering and admitted deadly vaccines and admitted everything we've
[49:12.880 --> 49:19.680]  talked about A to Z from NSA spying to GMO and glyphosates causing cancer. It's all being
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.920]  proven. It's all being documented. So what are they doing? They're shifting at the top
[49:24.920 --> 49:31.240]  to dictatorial, unelected multinational corporations getting governments to sign on to treaties
[49:31.240 --> 49:36.200]  waiving their rights. They're merging the three global power units of the Asian Pacific
[49:36.200 --> 49:41.680]  Union, the American Union, and the European Union through the TPP and the Atlantic Treaty
[49:41.680 --> 49:47.760]  Organization. This is all happening as we speak in everybody's face. And instead, we've
[49:47.760 --> 49:52.160]  got a bunch of people running around talking about transgender bathrooms and women with
[49:52.160 --> 49:56.000]  feminists painted on their face screaming and crying, oh my God, Donald Trump's so mean
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.760]  to the Muslims. This is mass mental illness, but that's at the bottom. It's mental illness
[50:00.760 --> 50:05.640]  at the top. The globalists can't win an intellectual battle with patriots. All they can do is
[50:05.640 --> 50:10.040]  accelerate the dumbing down with folks that aren't awake, build them into giant masses
[50:10.040 --> 50:16.240]  of brain sheep to basically run their political opposition off of cliffs. And then once the
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.720]  poor, pathetic sheep, like we see now in Venezuela, are on the street starving to death, it won't
[50:20.720 --> 50:25.880]  matter. They'll still like retarded baby birds be begging for their globalist masters to
[50:25.880 --> 50:32.040]  vomit stolen goods into their little tummies that doesn't exist. So this is humanity being
[50:32.040 --> 50:36.800]  sabotaged. If you ever wanted to see what it would look like if aliens could infiltrate
[50:36.800 --> 50:40.820]  humanity hypothetically as an allegory to what we're facing, really, it's a guild of
[50:40.820 --> 50:45.200]  psychopaths in bread. So they are alien who are building AI breakaway civilization, which
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.760]  is alien. We're creating Chimera cross species creations by the thousands that are alien.
[50:49.760 --> 50:56.040]  So in reality, we are facing a psychopath dream. Humans can dream and build anything
[50:56.040 --> 51:00.840]  we want. But psychopaths can dream and steal our dreams and have stolen our dreams and
[51:00.840 --> 51:09.840]  are building this giant all seeing twisted wannabe smart dust driven, panopticonic, overwatching,
[51:09.840 --> 51:17.960]  future predicting, twisted, false omnipresent God that they believe will make them gods
[51:17.960 --> 51:24.640]  when they merge as they accelerate gene gun splicing of thousands of species, cross species,
[51:24.640 --> 51:28.480]  degeneration, destruction of the environment. Just everything else you can imagine while
[51:28.480 --> 51:33.040]  claiming they're trying to save it when in reality they're in a mad psychopathic rush
[51:33.040 --> 51:37.960]  to build Godhood. But the God has told them they must first destroy this creation and
[51:37.960 --> 51:43.320]  overwrite it because the two creations cannot live in singularity together. Now that isn't
[51:43.320 --> 51:48.440]  beyond revelations. I'll eat my hat. So let's talk about the British exit, the Brexit. Let's
[51:48.440 --> 51:51.600]  talk about that briefly, Paul, that I'm going to get into all the other news dealing with
[51:51.600 --> 51:56.920]  Trump. But it's bigger than Trump because through this is a lens of distortion of how
[51:56.920 --> 52:01.480]  they can act like he's this horrible goblin monster and he has these armies of dumb-down
[52:01.480 --> 52:07.960]  minions sycophantically running around wanting to prove their manhood by killing him. It's
[52:07.960 --> 52:14.680]  just a sight to behold to see modern totalitarianism rising rapidly in the form of so-called liberalism
[52:14.680 --> 52:23.920]  Paul Watson. Well, here's the point. Let's play the game based on their rules. Okay.
[52:23.920 --> 52:33.080]  So Joe Cox, the labor MP in the United Kingdom, she was murdered by some United Kingdom art
[52:33.080 --> 52:43.320]  of law about Omar Mateen. His friends said that Omar Mateen, the pulse nightclub gunman
[52:43.320 --> 52:49.640]  supported Hillary Clinton. So is Hillary Clinton to blame? You know, is Hillary Clinton now
[52:49.640 --> 52:56.160]  going to have to disavow Omar Mateen for the next three to four weeks over and over again?
[52:56.160 --> 53:02.000]  Is Hillary Clinton going to have to suspend her campaign out of respect for the Orlando
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.240]  victims because Omar Mateen supported Hillary Clinton?
[53:06.240 --> 53:13.360]  Paul, let me interject on this. This is important. Hillary Clinton is to blame for helping create
[53:13.360 --> 53:18.320]  Al Qaeda and ISIS and giving them Syria and making bills to the EU to bring in the refugees
[53:18.320 --> 53:22.800]  who that help radicalize the climate so that first generationers from Afghanistan like
[53:22.800 --> 53:27.880]  Omar Mateen take action. And her government, her FBI, her Justice Department, Obama's
[53:27.880 --> 53:32.000]  system ordering the protection of this mosque, these imams, the rest of it. You can actually
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.080]  say she is to blame because there's all the connections. But in the case of some supposed
[53:38.080 --> 53:43.720]  crazy person shooting someone who's for staying in the Euro, and that's not even clear, and
[53:43.720 --> 53:47.920]  then blaming everyone that's for the British exit for sovereignty that's their fault. No,
[53:47.920 --> 53:50.680]  it's not their fault because they didn't give the Stinger missiles to them. They didn't
[53:50.680 --> 53:54.680]  open the borders. They didn't allow the radicalization. They didn't protect the, quote, mosque that
[53:54.680 --> 53:58.840]  was teaching him because there was no mosque. It wasn't any organized group delivering it.
[53:58.840 --> 54:02.040]  It was a mentally ill person who even believed that. Paul Watson.
[54:02.040 --> 54:06.560]  Exactly. I mean, you can go to the next example. You know, the guy they caught with explosives
[54:06.560 --> 54:12.000]  and guns on his way to a gay pride march. It's since come out that this individual, James
[54:12.000 --> 54:17.600]  Wesley Howell, was a Bernie Sanders supporter. Does that mean Bernie Sanders is to blame?
[54:17.600 --> 54:21.280]  Does that mean Bernie Sanders has to disavow his connection to this individual?
[54:21.280 --> 54:25.960]  Bernie Sanders attracts mentally ill people. Well, yeah, we've got the documented that
[54:25.960 --> 54:30.120]  on numerous occasions, but you know, if they want to play this game, let's play it, but
[54:30.120 --> 54:34.160]  they don't want to play it. They want to play it by different rules. It's not a level playing
[54:34.160 --> 54:38.280]  field. So again, the same with this guy who tried to assassinate Trump. You know, they'll
[54:38.280 --> 54:43.040]  probably blame that on Trump for his rhetoric. Even though this guy is in the UK, he's been
[54:43.040 --> 54:47.760]  hearing for the past six, eight months, Donald Trump's Nazi is a fascist. We need to ban
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.800]  him from the United Kingdom. He's dangerous. That's what he was radicalized by. That was
[54:52.800 --> 54:57.880]  the wellspring. That was the incitement for him to try and go and carry out that.
[54:57.880 --> 55:03.840]  Let me ask this question. Do you think the solitary and left worldwide is becoming openly
[55:03.840 --> 55:09.160]  fascistic and oppressive because they're arrogant and think they're winning or is it because
[55:09.160 --> 55:13.920]  they're losing? But that's the first part of the question separately. I tend to think
[55:13.920 --> 55:17.440]  it's both. They know they're starting to lose the cultural war. So they're having to go
[55:17.440 --> 55:21.760]  ahead and move to authoritarianism, even though it's a desperate gamble and tends to make
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.680]  people wake up even faster. Still, they just can't help it and have the classic instincts
[55:26.680 --> 55:30.400]  of tyrants that even though it's going to destroy him in the end, they can't help it.
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.240]  They want to exercise the raw, raw edge of power.
[55:34.240 --> 55:40.800]  No, I mean, that's precisely it. And you can look at Brexit as another example of that.
[55:40.800 --> 55:44.920]  Even if we vote leave, even if there is a Brexit on Thursday, which is when the vote
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.040]  takes place, they've basically already come out and said, oh, by the way, if you vote
[55:49.040 --> 55:52.640]  for Brexit, we're probably not going to follow through with it. We're not going to allow
[55:52.640 --> 55:58.080]  you to exercise your democratic will because the referendum is not law-abiding. So we're
[55:58.080 --> 56:02.520]  just going to go back to Parliament and discuss it for a few months. Maybe we'll do something.
[56:02.520 --> 56:07.320]  Maybe we won't. So even ahead of it, they're saying, we're just going to ignore your vote,
[56:07.320 --> 56:11.920]  just like the EU has done in many other countries. You know, the French, the Dutch, they vote,
[56:11.920 --> 56:17.160]  the Irish to get out of these things. The vote is ignored. The terms are changed and
[56:17.160 --> 56:19.720]  they make them vote again until they get the result they want.
[56:19.720 --> 56:27.440]  Sure. Paul, I think overall, that shows time is on our side in that the more they engage
[56:27.440 --> 56:31.400]  in shenanigans, the more they exempt themselves from taxes if you're an EU bureaucrat, the
[56:31.400 --> 56:37.000]  more they engage in all this bizarre animal farm behavior, the faster time runs out. Hopefully,
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.880]  on Brexit Day, just coming up here in a day or so, you will spend a lot of time with us,
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.120]  Paul, and also host some special transmissions from London, England. Thank you so much, Paul
[56:45.120 --> 56:46.120]  Watson.
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.120]  Thanks, Alex.
[56:47.120 --> 56:52.480]  All right. I appreciate Paul sitting in today, spending time with my family. Hey, I got here
[56:52.480 --> 56:55.120]  a little bit late for the broadcast, which was always kind of a plan that if things are
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.720]  going well with the kids and we're having a good time and they're not tired or anything
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.480]  that we would end up letting Paul and some of the other folks host part of the show.
[57:02.480 --> 57:07.000]  And I do deserve a vacation. I mean, we all need to take a break sometimes, but it's
[57:07.000 --> 57:10.280]  torched to not be on air when I'm reading all this news and seeing what's going on.
[57:10.280 --> 57:14.680]  I mean, this is not a job for me. This is a fight. This is a commitment. This is what
[57:14.680 --> 57:18.920]  my life is all about because if you don't fight for liberty, you will be a slave. It's
[57:18.920 --> 57:24.120]  a fact. It's like having screen doors on submarines. You will flood. You will sink if you don't
[57:24.120 --> 57:28.400]  have those doors on. Briefly, we need to be funded. We need the support to have our
[57:28.400 --> 57:32.600]  reporters all over the world and breaking analysis and having just huge effects on the
[57:32.600 --> 57:38.160]  discourse of human activities in the direction of liberty. We have Roger Stone news coming
[57:38.160 --> 57:42.600]  up, big news on attacks on free speech. When we start the next hour, Roger Stone gave us
[57:42.600 --> 57:46.400]  key intel this morning and has relayed a message to us exclusively. We're going to be breaking
[57:46.400 --> 57:51.560]  here on the other side. Briefly, we're running the biggest special ever on Hillary for President

[59:52.960 --> 01:00:01.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:15.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. From the front lines of
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:31.640]  the information war, it's Alex Jones. Careful what you see. I don't take any pleasure in
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:39.360]  how dumb down the average Democrat is. There's kind of an upper crust that pursue an intellectual
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.440]  and are kind of fighting battles with corrupt forms of so-called conservatism from 30, 40,
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:49.600]  50 years ago and they have some legitimate points they make, but they're battling old
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:54.360]  dead dragons. You know, it's kind of like I used to expose George W. Bush for stuff
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:59.880]  he was doing. He's out of power now, okay? Obama's three times worse according to Jonathan
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:05.080]  Turley, liberal constitutional lawyer and many others. The head of the Green Party has come
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:10.800]  out and said Hillary's worse than Trump because it's true. I mean, she's so fascistic. She's
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:16.120]  so corrupt. It isn't about party affiliation for me. It's about reality. And I look at
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.280]  leftists that say, well, we're not going to let right wingers get in control. And we know
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:25.680]  Obama's bad, but at least he's given us some of what we want, like Obamacare, written
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.960]  by foreign insurance companies. And then Grupper, who helped write it, talks about how great
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:38.880]  it is that we're dumb. I mean, it really is your perception that Obama loves you and
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.800]  cares about you and that things are getting better. They fake the jobs numbers. They fake
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.800]  the unemployment numbers. They fake the inflation numbers. That's all admitted. But we have
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.200]  a 1.8 growth with cook numbers. It's probably two points negative. That's a depression
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:57.320]  for most people. But you're secure in your government job or your government connected
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:04.560]  corporate job. And so you just want to say, let them eat cake as if you are delusionally
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.940]  somehow in power. People imagine they're part of the power structure. I mean, if Donald
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:16.000]  Trump gets in office and starts going sideways on issues, I'm going to say he totally chumped
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.120]  us. We've got to expose this guy and go after him. I'm not going to just go, well, he's
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:26.880]  my guy. So I'm going to support him. So I feel like I'm getting ahead and I feel like
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:33.280]  I'm on the winning team. That's called being huku. That's called being completely insane.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.000]  And more and more, it's not even about intellectually proving our points here. They're by running
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.680]  around with rainbow flags saying Donald Trump wants to, you know, kill gay people. And I
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:47.320]  mean, it's you, you're, you're literally nuts. His whole track record has been super liberal
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:54.280]  when it comes to that. Quite a lot of conservatives didn't like you, but it doesn't matter to
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.520]  you because you want to feel hurt. You want to feel like you're on a bandwagon. You want
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:03.520]  to feel like we shake your finger at people at protest because, you know, you're in the
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:09.280]  right and they're in the wrong and it feels good to be a winner. You are delusional. You
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:16.680]  are in your own world. Admit you are. What you're doing isn't reality based. And that
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:25.080]  goes for the pseudo-intellectual leftist leadership that runs right down to just the average person
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.960]  of the street that hears, I hate Donald Trump. He's an idiot. He's racist. He's bad. And
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.120]  you can virtue signal. The worst people are white people on this. I'm just a fact. Virtue
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.600]  signal to someone who's a spanish or black or whatever. It's so kind of sitting when
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:43.280]  people virtue signal. And I've got a really sweet family who, who aren't racist. They're
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.720]  good people, but, you know, it's mainly older family members that grew up with them. It's
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:52.520]  still a lot of friction and stuff. And they will just virtue signal like there is no end
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:04:01.280]  to it. So patronizing, so patronizing to people. We need to just transcend it and be based
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:08.040]  on free market, based on free open society, open association. And then you associate
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:14.280]  with who you want. You support what you like. You buy what you like. You, you tell people
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:19.800]  about what you like. That's how a free system operates. Just like internet rating systems.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.360]  They're not perfect, but they've raised quality of furniture and food and culture and art
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.880]  and just you name it to an incredible level because people get a chance to see how they
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:33.240]  could live or what they could have or inexpensive ways to renovate their house and then improve
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.200]  the value. And there's a lot of really great things happening in culture. And the truth
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:43.720]  is people are getting along really good between religions and races. If they're just left
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:47.800]  alone, unless you're talking about Islam, which is incompatible. And that's why they're
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:55.080]  bringing so much of it in because they want to create a total circus. And then when those
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.960]  of us that do want to open free society say, Hey, if we're going to have a party that's
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:05.440]  open and free, everybody's got rules from the FAA limit small commercial drone operations
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:12.200]  to daylight hours and require operators to get certified every two years reports USA
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:20.400]  today. The FAA's 624 page rule book allows commercial drones weighing up to 55 pounds
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:26.320]  to fly during daylight hours and lower than 400 feet in the air. The drone must remain
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:31.720]  within the site of the operator or an observer who is in communication with the operator.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:37.400]  The operators must be at least 16 years old and pass an aeronautics test every 24 months
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:43.880]  for certification. An administrator for the agency said evening operations will be allowed
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:49.960]  if the drone carries lies visible for three miles and a waiver could be used for nighttime
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:06:01.360]  flights. You can find more reports on info wars dot com. Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben

[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.560]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.880]  of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows

[01:08:51.960 --> 01:09:09.440]  end of the day.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.720]  We're just here saying, whoa, our controllers are trying to bankrupt us. They've already
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.720]  bankrupted over 100 other countries. They write textbooks on how they do it. They're
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:25.840]  trying to bankrupt us emotionally, culturally, spiritually, morally, to make us absolute
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:35.360]  controllable trash. Humanity is being herded and organized into a system of exterminism.
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.880]  And I'm here trying to expose it. Well, we've already covered a lot of amazing news in the
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:46.240]  last hour of myself and Paul Watson. And we're going to be taking your phone calls at the
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.040]  bottom of this hour today on the question of the assassination of Donald Trump. Is it
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:56.720]  going to happen? Is the establishment going to kill Trump themselves and then climb a
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.640]  mental patient did it? Or are they trying with their different psychological warfare
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:08.720]  systems to simply hype it and hype it and hype it and push it in rock and roll and
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:16.520]  hip hop. And in the New York times and in the buzz feed and the daily beast and everywhere
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:22.080]  else, someone killed Trump, someone taking him out. They just put that mantra out, hoping
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:28.640]  that some type of mental patient or wound up idiot fruit will end up sneaking into one
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:34.600]  of his events and be able to put a bullet in Donald J. Trump because clearly they're
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.440]  trying to assassinate talk radio. They're trying to assassinate the internet globally,
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.360]  putting in kill switches. They're trying to censor speech. They're trying to end the words
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.720]  mother and father and he and she because that's hurtful. They're trying to say the American
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.040]  flag is evil and the British flag is bad. They are setting the precedent to arrest whoever
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.040]  they want. They're already doing it in Germany and France to criticize the Muslims. And so
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.920]  we're entering the season of not just political assassination where they assassinate your political
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:08.640]  character, but where they physically assassinate you. I want to ask that question toll free
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:17.760]  number to join us 800-259-9231-800-2599-231. First time callers, by the way, they give
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:25.760]  you a chance to call in the first round of calls 800-259-9231 and we will get you up
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:30.720]  and on the air. Now let's talk about some criticism of Donald Trump, which is criticism
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:42.640]  coming from Alex Jones. Last Thursday he put out a tweet in which he said very, very clearly
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:53.200]  in my view that, hey, I'm going to talk to the NRA and I'm going to talk to the NRA
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:12:00.920]  about putting terrorists on a no-gun by list. Now are those terrorists that were convicted?
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:06.920]  No. Were those terrorists that were under indictment? No. Were those terrorists under
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:11.240]  sealed indictment? No. Were those terrorists even under current investigation? No. It's
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.400]  just were those convicted terrorists? Were those proven terrorists? No. Because you see
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:22.360]  it's looking at the whole backdrop. It sounds very reasonable on the surface to say I will
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.920]  be meeting with the NRA who has endorsed me about not allowing people on the terrorist
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:33.600]  watch list or the no-fly list to buy guns. ABC News last week. So on the surface you're
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:37.760]  like, well, my God, I mean, obviously the government's good. It would only put terrorists
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:43.480]  on the terrorist no-fly list or watch list. I've had family put on it. There have been
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:52.720]  seven members of Congress with very common names put on it. This is the reality. It's
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.640]  the end of due process where they can put anybody they want on a list to take your guns.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.120]  What have they already been doing to hundreds of thousands a year? It's in the millions
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:09.720]  of veterans going back to World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Panama, all of it, right
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:15.160]  through to Desert Storm, Desert Shield, all of it, right through all of it, right through
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:23.720]  the 1991 to 2003, right through to today. They are putting people with no judge, no
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:28.640]  jury, they just have some psychology file that they might have had PTSD, no more guns
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:35.280]  for you, no judge, no jury, no announcement by the federal government, no judicial finding,
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.240]  no hearing, no one you can accuse, no accuser you can accuse, no paper trail, you just get
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:45.480]  put on a list and you can't buy guns anymore. And then if you're in California, Illinois,
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.320]  New York, Massachusetts and a bunch of other states, like 16 states now, and you're on
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:14:01.120]  that list that the good old folks at the Veterans Affairs Association set up, you get a letter
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.440]  first from the state police who are under federal control in a federal program saying
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.120]  we need you to come down to the station with your guns. And if you don't respond to that,
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:16.920]  they show up with a SWAT team and take your guns. So that's what's going on. And so this
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:21.720]  is the holy grail of gun grabbing. Remember they had a couple articles, one on the U.S.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.760]  today and another one on the Washington Post, just this last weekend saying we need to have
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:33.520]  stealth gun ban and what was the exact headline of one? Let me go to memory here. The exact
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:40.480]  headline was we need to secretly repeal the Second Amendment. That was one of the headlines.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.200]  And that's what this is. In fact, I said that a few years ago when they had the Bloomberg
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:50.920]  headline, gun confiscation begins in California. It was mainly veterans who had no criminal
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:54.480]  records in most cases or did anything wrong. They just suddenly had a SWAT team at their
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.320]  house taking their guns. And then when they would show up at the police station and say,
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.720]  give me my guns back, they'd say, oh, we need you to come back here. We're going to do a
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:07.040]  psychological evaluation yourself. So the thought police are grabbing veterans and taking
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:12.880]  their guns, even though statistically they're one of the lowest crime rate groups. Oh, they're
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.240]  all suspect though, because they're the number one Homeland Security threat. Remember? We
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.720]  got the secret documents eight years ago. Nobody believed us. A couple years later, they admitted
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.440]  they were all real. Now everybody goes, oh, yeah, the veterans, the gun owners, the Christians,
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:28.480]  the conservatives, the patriots, the libertarians, they're the terrorists, the land rights activists,
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.640]  the Americans, the folks that won't completely roll over. So this is all going on. So they
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.240]  call for a secret or stealth repeal of the Second Amendment. That's what this is. And
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.280]  I don't know if Trump is being crafty because he does this sometimes and knows the public's
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.160]  dumbed down. They're like, hey, we don't want terrorists to have guns. People on the watch
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:54.360]  list or no fly list. He's like, yeah, we look into that. Let me meet with the honoree about
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:58.960]  that. And the honoree puts out tweets. I guess he hasn't met yet saying, hey, we don't want
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.600]  this. We got to have due process. But somebody can be proven to be a terrorist affiliated
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.720]  and a foreigner and not a citizen. Yes. And I agree with that too. You're a foreigner here.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.720]  You're connected to terrorist groups. Damn right. Kick your butt out of the country. How
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:17.120]  about not just you can't get guns? How about haul your butt out? This is our country. When
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:21.560]  you're a citizen, you have rides, you pay taxes. Not not not when you just show up. We
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.800]  want to see a little bit of proof about who you are. Everybody else does it. We're doing
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.320]  it too. But that's not where this is going now because he's on Bill O'Reilly and O'Reilly
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:35.320]  said, well, you agree Republicans agree. Everybody does. We got to do something about terrorists
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.040]  getting guns. Oh yeah, terrorists that pass background checks whose dad got brought here
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:45.240]  by the CIA to the FBI's would order twice to stand down when his monsters kill gay people.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.280]  All the red flags, all the signs, all the bells and whistles, all the warning signs, the, you
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:56.080]  know, just huge alarms, alert, alert, alert, alert, alert. I mean, whatever, you'll play
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:02.960]  a song from or a sound from Star Trek. Red alert. I mean, everything's going off here.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:09.720]  Okay, major 10 bell, fire alarm. Okay, we're talking ban your ears out over the top and
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:15.200]  nothing's being done. But then it turns around, we got to stop terrorists, don't we? And he
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.640]  knows that he'll then be soft on terrorists. He says, yeah, yeah, sure. Let me look into
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.240]  that. Well, that's, that's too far. Trump needs to up front say, will you stop terrorist
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.640]  and real groups that you're letting in? But we're not going to just general put the public
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:33.320]  in some unnamed list and then do this because they can take anybody's guns. Okay, that's
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.200]  what Trump needs to say. And we need to break down and it's simple. So I'm concerned about
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.040]  we're going to come back from break and actually play the clip. But I've gone from watching
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:48.080]  this to being concerned, point blank. Now, before we go any further here, briefly, we're
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:52.800]  going to end the Tim Kennedy special today. This is helping obviously the money we make
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:57.560]  from this finance, a lot of preparedness programs we want to produce, a lot of shooting programs
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:01.320]  we want to produce, a lot of urban farming, free programs that we want to produce with
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.960]  Tim and others. And so the proceeds help to go hire the camera people and pay for the
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.960]  flights and then the crews and also do some overseas coverage. I'm just going to leave
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:14.920]  it at that stop right there. But it's great to have Tim working as a correspondent and

[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:09.040]  What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not just another one of your
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:15.400]  place? You're the percenter. What if I stay? I'm your host Alex Jones here. Your phone
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:19.080]  calls are coming up in the next segment. Will they try to assassinate Donald Trump? Well,
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.800]  the media hyping go out and tell him it's the right thing to do. You'll be a hero if
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:29.080]  you do. Again, from the Daily Beast to the New York Times, they've all done it. We've
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:36.680]  all seen it. That is organized crime behavior. You need to know that a major dawn of a, say,
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:43.120]  Italian crime family never says, I want this person dead. They say, somebody use to take
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:47.840]  his problem for me. That's, that's, that's how that's done. So they're openly, when
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:51.920]  you have a major media platform, you're organizing and saying somebody needs to kill somebody.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:59.120]  That's called racketeering because you've got the power. You're the Patron. You're the
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:04.200]  boss. You're the El Hefe. And you're out there to your millions of people saying, kill someone,
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:09.120]  go after them. That has the authority to basically get people to take action. And then you are
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:15.160]  an accomplice to it. So the mainstream media, the corporate, globalist media is an accomplice
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.880]  to the successful or unsuccessful assassination attempt at Donald Trump. There's already been
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.240]  unsuccessful attempts like we saw in Vegas. An illegal alien, of course, trying to kill
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:31.560]  him. So whacked out of his mind that I can't come here and everything for free. Hey, China
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.800]  has mobile execution vans. I don't care. China killed 84 million people in her mouth. Shut
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:41.800]  up. You know, hey, China, you know, is murdering thousands a day right now. I don't care. Shut
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:47.760]  up, Donald Trump's evil. I mean, that's just, they're just, they're just horrible, vicious,
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:52.600]  stupid, little twisted weirdos. But if you want to know what gun control is going to
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:58.080]  look like, which is gun confiscation, they're not going to tell you the name of it. As I
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:02.720]  just illustrated, they call it gun control. It's taking your guns everywhere the globalist
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:08.960]  are in control. It's about a monopoly of power in their own words. So if you want to see
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.880]  what gun confiscation is going to look like, it's going to be done by stealth, just like
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:17.720]  they're doing in California, Massachusetts, other areas, they're going to harass gun owners.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:24.640]  They just had another federal court rule that they can ban assault rifles. That's any, any
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.720]  semi auto. They ruled a few months ago. And guess what the Supreme Court did this morning?
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.120]  This is big news. They said, yeah, you can ban assault weapons. You can have a ban a statewide
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:42.360]  ban on semi on us. Supreme Court leaves state assault weapons ban in place. Boom. Associated
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:48.640]  press. So I told you this is their move. They're making their move. They've killed Scalia. Thomas
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:56.080]  is leaving. I guess he's been threatened. So funny. That's not just my opinion. Let me
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.240]  tell you, the shadows are getting long. The ring rates are here. More doors making its
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.800]  move and rolling over to it ain't the way to get out of it. And you got another federal
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.640]  court rule that they can not let you have guns in public and the Supreme Court upheld
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:16.000]  that. They said, we're not going to, we're not going to hear that, which is upholding.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.720]  So it's on folks. It's on Supreme Court refuses to hear challenge to Connecticut's ban on
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.320]  assault weapons. Justices decide without comment, not to review lower court decision, but up
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.840] held the laws. It's on. We're not going to have a DC versus Heller that says you got
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:34.680]  a right to defend yourself. No, that's on the shopping blog now, but no one wants your
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:38.840]  guns conspiracy theorist. Oh, but now there's newspapers everywhere and Rolling Stones saying
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.320]  it's time to ban them. It's time to repeal the second amendment and take all guns. Oh,
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:49.760]  that's actually your plan. Oh, we were right again. Sorry. Well, you get all the body guards
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:55.920]  in the army, redoubts and prepare the collapse. Yes. But what happens when the unstoppable
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:01.080]  force runs into the immovable objects? That's where we're going. Gun owners know that once
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:04.240]  you get our guns, you're physically coming for us. You're already getting our bank accounts,
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.040]  our kids, everything else, our Bibles. You already took over our churches. I mean, we
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:12.960]  know this is a full takeover with a satanic beef for Christendom that had some great
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:18.120]  potential in America. I don't mean the fake Christianoid whore churches up there on the
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.640]  big hill government run. I mean the real Christian church. And that's why they're coming after
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:28.360]  it because the true Christian church created renaissance and true free will because that's
[01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:33.480]  what God gives you is real free will and an open society and a chance to really make decisions
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:41.720]  for yourself. But the chains are on the chains are going back on right now. Meanwhile, Donald
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:45.600]  Trump comes out last week and says, I'm going to talk to the NRA about people that are on
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.200]  no, no, no, no fly terror list, not don't have guns. Sounded like he was saying he's
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.080]  talking to him about that like he wants it. I said, you need to clarify that he hadn't
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:59.000]  really clarified it. And then he was on Bill O'Reilly last night had this to say, you and
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.200]  gun control. All right, let's run down the list. Um, they got to tighten up the tarot
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.960]  watch vis-a-vis buying gunless, right? That's got to happen, right? Yes, sure. Absolutely.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.600]  Who would not agree with that? And I think the NRA would agree with it too. But we have
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.680]  to have a very precise thing about if you're on a tarot watch list, this is what you can
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:25.000]  and can't do. What about the big guns? All right. I'm going to come back and play that
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.640]  from the start again. Because the NRA doesn't actually agree with that. The NRA said, well,
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.520]  we have to stop the sex due process. But if it's a real terrorist, like, you know, foreigner,
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:39.080]  and we know they are, okay, then yes, but not just two million Americans on the list.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.640]  Stay with us. We'll be back in your phone. Bill Day, assassinate Donald Trump, family
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.480]  stump, the assassination of Donald Trump. And what will happen if they do assassinate Donald
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:55.480]  Trump? Stay with us. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:05.040]  radio network, a series of dueling gun control measures in the Senate were defeated Monday
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:10.440]  evening in the first proposed legislation in the wake of the Orlando terror attack, reports
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:16.240]  Fox News. The four amendments all failed on procedural votes. The first vote was on the
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:21.600]  amendment by Senator Chuck Grassley to enhance funding for an existing gun background check
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:28.560]  system which needed 60 votes to pass. The final vote tally was 53 to 47. The second vote was
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:34.120]  on a measure by Senator Chris Murphy to expand gun background checks and close the so-called
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:41.160]  gun show loophole. The final vote tally was 44 to 56. Republican Senator John Cornyn of
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:46.160]  Texas pushed a measure that would allow the government to delay a gun sale to a suspected
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:53.760]  terrorist for 72 hours. It failed in a final vote of 53 to 47. You can find more reports
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:31:11.040]  on infowars.com.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:32:11.240]  problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that
[01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:16.320]  I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:22.080]  dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:27.920]  a host mechanism. Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.920]  warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.360]  said there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:41.000]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.720]  year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.840]  today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com and folks, you can't
[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:52.880]  lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast,
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:57.000]  infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:12.840]  for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:19.280]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:29.360]  to Alex Jones. I want to go to Graham, Kurt, Christine, John, Michael, Michelle, and many
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.960]  others that are patiently holding. The toll free number to join us is 800-25-99-231, first
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.320]  time callers. I want to specifically talk to you here in a few minutes when I go to
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:46.240]  you about the mainstream media, the corporate Decepticon media, the collaborator media,
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:52.440]  deceiver media, just the horrible scum media. I don't have words to describe these people
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:57.120]  trying to get folks to kill Donald Trump and creating this mindless hype and the howl of
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.920]  the mob that he's the devil incarnate. Will he be assassinated? What's your gut tell you?
[01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:11.640]  What will happen if he is assassinated? It's a very, very serious issue, but getting
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.440]  back to the way they've sold this, this is what Obama wanted before he got in office
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:20.440]  when he was running for office nine years ago. Jerome Emmanuel talked about the campaign.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:25.720]  I played the clip probably 100 times over the years, and they say, hey, if you're maybe
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.360]  possibly a terrorist on the no fly list, you can't have a gun. Well, I mean, five-year-old
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:35.640]  kids are on it. You can't ever get off of it. It's a joke. So they go from a background
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.800]  check, a waiting period to the FBI check to see you're not a criminal to, oh, we just
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:45.200]  don't know why, but you can never have a gun. And they're already taking guns this way
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:51.120]  from veterans. And remember a few months ago, even the FBI came out and said, we're being
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:57.120]  told by Congress and by the Obama administration, the members of Congress to look at applying
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:07.960]  what the Veterans Affairs Group does. We're looking at doing that right now in a big way
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:12.880]  to everyone on Social Security saying you're inept, saying what was the exact term they
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.120]  used, that you are all declared incompetent if, for example, you have money wired each
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:22.960]  month for your Social Security check automatically into a bank account. And then you just won't
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.960]  know why you're not allowed to buy a gun anymore. They're just normalizing it by stealth. They're
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:32.320]  doing it. And it sounds reasonable. Hey, if you're a terrorist on the no fly list or
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.840]  the watch list, you shouldn't be able to go buy a gun, right? And then he's like, well,
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:39.840]  that makes sense. Everybody agrees with that. No, everybody doesn't agree with that. And
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.720]  remember Trump was like, yeah, we got to bring the refugees in. They're Christians are being
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.800]  killed. They don't actually, they're not letting the Christians in. They're radical
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:49.560]  jihadists. They're not being vetted. Well, if that's the case, block them all until they
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:53.360]  start vetting them again. That's common sense. Stop it all until whether it's a week or two
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.760]  weeks, he said, you know, a short period of time until you actually check them, make them
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:02.080]  check. He wants to deport all Muslims. He doesn't want to bring them in. And then he
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.600]  gets so pigheaded. Yeah, that's what I said, you know, it's because he knows he's got to
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.160]  look confident to a dumbed down mass of people. This is psychology you use on five year olds.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:16.160]  Now, let me be clear. A lot of the mainline conservatives are about like five year olds,
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:19.880]  but the average liberals like a two year old Paul Watson did a whole analysis and showed
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:23.640]  some scientific studies about how they act like toddlers. So he's heading a five year
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.320]  old constituency and Hillary's going for a two and a half, three year old. And I'm not
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:32.040]  joking when I say that. I mean, we are literally dealing with complete nincompoops. And again,
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:36.360]  the average elitist goes, well, that's good. Let's feed on these idiots. No, no, no, no,
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:40.720]  no, let's try to protect people that are smarter than them and have wealth and develop
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.960]  things, but let's build up humanity for heaven's sake. So let's just not wipe them all out.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:50.280]  Their answer with the precarious is what we always knew it was, but everybody on welfare
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:53.880]  or make their job government dependent so that you won't buck the system because you're
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.200]  tied to it. That's what cancer does. So it's all here. Now I want to finish this clip and
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:01.960]  I'm going to get David Knight's take. He's sitting on the wings, you know, back there
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:06.720]  at Cape Cranavaral or the launch site in Austin, Texas. I know Cape Cranavarals in Florida
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:12.000]  folks, Houston's in Texas is a joke, but he's back there at the mothership. And I want to
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.680]  get his take here in just a moment on whether he thinks they'll successfully assassinate
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:20.120]  him because they're really pushing this rhetoric. And I mean, it's like when there's wind and
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.640]  black clouds blowing in and you can see rain on the horizon, is it going to be raining
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:28.360]  here in a few minutes? I don't know. But smart money says, yeah, it's going to rain. A storm
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:33.680]  is coming in. Smart money says they're going to get some shots off on him. I mean, he's
[01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:38.680]  going to be in mortal danger. And you'd think that he'd be even more manly if folks would
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:42.000]  support him. No, no, no, the left will piss on that. And, you know, this is a group of
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.440]  fascistic thumb suck and trash folks. These are demonic 35, 40 year old, you know, toddlers.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:53.000]  So we're going to go to your phone calls here in just a moment as well on that subject.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.760]  But before we go any further, please do not forget that the Tim Kennedy special 15% off
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:04.000]  ends today. And that's super mill vitality. That's secret 12, the best bottom B12 out
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.280]  there, taken out of the tongue, liquid, totally pure. And then of course, brain force 15%

[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.920]  water filtration systems. That is this week as well. And we've got upwards of 75% off
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.200]  on Hillary for prison shirts. We send the promo code out to folks who are signed up
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.440]  for the free newsletter and info wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:33.320]  But before I do that, let's go back to from a very start. I want to play a minute of this.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:41.400]  This is, this is Trump with Bill O'Reilly. They have milkshakes together. Good guys.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:45.160]  Here he is creeping around on his so called friend of decades saying, well, you know,
[01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:49.680]  you're going to support this gun control. And Trump's like, yeah, then he goes into
[01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.280]  all these big guns talking to us like we're three years old. By the way, at the corporate
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.040]  level, they say talk to people like they're three to five years old. That's a known corporate
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.840]  statement of talk to people like they're five. Well, now it's down to three. The new corporate
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:04.520]  thing is behind closed doors is talk to public like they're like they're three. So he's
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:10.320]  like, they're big, big terrorists give boom, boom. And then Trump goes, no, you agree.
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:17.240]  No, boom, boom. And then they go, and one about big, boom, boom. Take big, boom, boom.
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:24.560]  Wait, boom, boom. Your baby want me a milkshake. I mean, you know, see, I'm not trying to play
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.680]  in and rule the planet of the middle midget lollipop guilt. I want to be a great mind
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:36.640]  in the species that excels. And we know excels when you put pressures on it and when you
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:42.840]  honor achievement, you don't think they're turning us into trickly pubs for no reason.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.560]  They're getting ready to kill us. And believe me, Bill O'Reilly, your family's not going
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:50.640]  to get to go to the next level. You either Trump, no one's getting away with selling
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.840]  out the planet. That's the big con. You got to be under delusional spirit to not understand
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.360]  that the devil's not offering a good deal. Now, let's just go back now briefly here
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:06.320]  to Bill O'Reilly talking to folks that are five years old. Here it is. Now, you and gun
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:12.120]  control. All right, let's run down the list. They got to tighten up the tarot watch visa
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:17.240]  V buying gun list, right? That's got to happen, right? Yes, sure. Absolutely. Who would not
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.000]  agree with that? And I think the NRA would agree with it, too. But we have to have a
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.240]  very precise thing about if you're on a tarot watch list, this is what you can and can't
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:33.880]  do. What about the big guns? All right. You know, do people need the big rifles that fire
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:40.680]  a lot of rounds? Do they need them? Well, the big guns, first of all, are the same guns
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:45.280]  that the enemy has and that people that can break into your home or do what this maniac
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:49.360]  did over the weekend. And the big guns are the same guns. I mean, you're going to have
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:54.680]  to have that. Okay, so you use them for protection. You know, they use them. They also use them
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:59.480]  for recreation, Bill. I have friends that are my sons are in the NRA. So am I. People
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:04.240]  use them for recreation. Are you have no problem with that? Would you put any limits on, you
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.920]  know, you can't have a mortar, can't have hand grenades, can't have a bazooka, right?
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.160]  Would you put any limits on? Back it up, please. This is Bill O'Reilly caught talking to his
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:20.640]  audience like three years old. I mean, everyone knows you can't order. Everyone knows you
[01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:25.000]  can't get hand grenades. Everyone knows there's no crime with mortars and hand grenades. Everyone
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.880]  knows there was one crime committed in the last 50 years that you could get 50 caliber
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.680]  rifles. An armored car got robbed with one. I got two of them right there in my office,
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:39.320]  Barrett 50 Kells, one Army version, one Navy version, helicopter version, it's Coast Guard
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:43.120]  version, short barrel version. They're not coming out at night hurting anybody. And you
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:49.240]  know, in the big graph understate we've got as old sponsor graph under anyways, the point
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:55.200]  is that this is the mind control. So okay, okay, Trump can they have hand grenades, can
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.880]  they have laser beams, can they have atomic weapons, can they have atom smashers, can
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:04.280]  they have cyclotrons, can they have Gatling guns, can they have warthogs, ATINs, can they
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.880]  have Harrier Jump Jets, can they have SR-71 Blackbirds, can they have space stations,
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:16.320]  can they have blimps, can they have nuclear missiles with atomic bombs, ICBMs? Back it
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.520]  up, 10 seconds, let's play it, I'm gonna get David Knight, your calls, here it is.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:23.360]  Reasons, would you put any limits on, you know, you can't have a mortar, can't have
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.200]  hand grenades, can't have a bazooka, would you put any limits on what you can and can't
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:36.520]  buy? On the guns, I wouldn't because again, it's a question of protection and also, where
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:38.560]  do you end? Where do you end?
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.560]  Flippery slow.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:44.140]  No, I would, I get along very well with the NRA on most of these subjects. I think probably
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:49.400]  the one is that when you're on a terror watch list, perhaps in a certain sense, my stance
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:53.040]  is tougher than anybody, but when you're on a terror watch list, you're on, you don't
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:54.040]  get a gun.
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:57.040]  Yeah, they just have to have rules because there are mistakes and they're right in there.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.240]  No, no, they're right, there are mistakes. And by the way, there are many, many mistakes
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:04.640]  on those watch lists. And what I would do, frankly, is work hard to eradicate the mistakes
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.200]  and make sure that these people get off the list as soon as possible, which is another
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.200]  way of asking.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:18.000]  Well, here's the deal, Trump. I want to hear that someone is under total scrutiny and is
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.880]  not a citizen because now you have the IRS saying if you fly outside the country and
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.560]  we're investigating, you can't leave or come back. Or now they want to have it, they can't
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:30.800]  go on a plane and the IRS says they're investigating you. Well, who isn't getting audited every year?
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:34.800]  My whole life, the damn IRS was harassing my family, even though they were paying the
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.400]  horse, the frauds. My dad came in and said, I've been paying. They go, we're criminals,
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.680]  sir. Should we give us your money? We're going to take everything you got. You spent the
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.800]  next decade fighting them.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:49.320]  So I'm not going to sit here and put up with this. This is the end of the process. It's
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:54.760]  wrong. And I'm not going to just trust Trump to say, oh, yeah, I support this. We'll fix
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.600]  the problems of the veterans all by the hundreds of thousands, millions now that can't get
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.520]  guns and they don't know why because they're just put on the list. And the FBI says, hey,
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.520]  we're getting ready to make us do this. I'm going to Graham. I'm going to Michael. I'm
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.080]  going to John. I'm going to Kirk. I'm going to Christine. I'm going to you right now.
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:15.280]  I'm going to you. But I want to go briefly to David Knight because he's in the wings
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.160]  in case I have any technical difficulties. He'll be hosted the fourth hour. We have the
[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:22.640]  second part of my Ask Me Anything Reddit AMA. It was pretty powerful. This is the second
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.000]  part of premiering here on the radio and TV next hour. And then David comes back live.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.680]  But David, your take a on the assassination of Trump. What do you think is in the wind
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:36.920]  and then B, what do you think of this Trump situation with the due process and the terror
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.400]  watch list, which is a total fraud?
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.920]  Let me take the second one first. Alex says, I was listening to Bill O'Reilly saying, well,
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:49.000]  can people citizens of the United States, can they own hand grenades? Can they own mortars?
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.600]  I would ask him, can terrorists own hand grenades? Can terrorists own mortars? We need to know.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:01.800]  Yeah, the problem is not guns. The problem is having porous borders and not only that,
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:07.080]  but having a president who wants to bring in people from areas where he's been dropping
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:11.120]  bombs on them and assassinating people, stirring it up like a hornet's nest and then bringing
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:17.360]  in the angry hornets into our country. That's the problem. It's not guns. It's our business.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:23.360]  I've got a Ford truck, okay, with big tires around the marsh or whatever. I mean, I could
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.680]  sit there if I wanted to hypothetically and find a crowd on Sixth Street and run over
[01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:31.240]  500 people. Can I have a big murderous truck? Could I go get a license and get a jet and
[01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:34.760]  fly into stuff? Hypothetically, of course I could. I'm not going to. I mean, they have
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:42.360]  the MO. They have all of us. It's called profiling. Alex Jones, David Knight isn't going to do
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:47.360]  that. We're part of Western civilization. We built it where humans are allowed to have
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:53.080]  jets and big trucks and things. We built the damn civilization. Okay. Individuals did,
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:56.760]  working together. So don't sit there and lecture us how we can't have something that's dangerous
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.400]  because we might hurt somebody when you bring in stone age crazies that lock up women like
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.960]  animals, cut their genitals off and are killing each other 24-7. It's the stinking government
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.200]  and the social engineers that are to blame and they shouldn't have guns anymore. Bill
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:16.000]  O'Reilly shouldn't have bodyguards. I'm sick of that sniveller. When he was a radio host,
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.640]  he used to have the police called and would send private bodyguards to people's houses
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.800]  in Florida and New York where he lives. He had caller ID and talk radio. Nobody else
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:29.240]  has that. And with literally, if someone disagreed, send bullies to their house. O'Reilly, you
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.280]  send bullies to my house. I'm going to break their jaw. And if you try that with me, punk,
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:39.920]  I don't care if you're a thug who wants to bully people. Okay? You got to be ashamed
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:44.240]  of yourself. After all the bullying Irish went through, you turned into a big, fat bully.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:51.120]  You're a big, fat bully, scumbag. You understand that? I'm sick of these people. Damn liar.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:54.160]  All right, go ahead. Just finish up night and I'm going to the calls.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:59.520]  Well, as Bill O'Reilly is putting out all the basic headfakes that the left uses against
[01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:04.680]  the Second Amendment saying, well, what weapons of war are we not going to let people have.
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:09.480]  We've got a woman who was just arrested this last weekend, who was from the Middle East,
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:14.120]  an illegal alien who was here. When she was apprehended, she had the plans to a vast pipeline
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:20.560]  network that she had in her car. I mean, you can use a pipeline as a weapon of mass destruction.
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:25.640]  And of course, you can do nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The bottom line is that
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:30.000]  we need to have these weapons not for hunting. And again, I was disappointed to see Donald
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.960]  Trump use that canard because we've even seen the libertarians come out and say, well, assault
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:39.720]  rifles are not protected under the Second Amendment because they're not for hunting.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:44.480]  The Second Amendment is not about hunting. It's about making sure that the people of
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.480]  this country, the militia, have the tools with which they can defend themselves, not
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:54.840]  just against private criminals, but against invasion from foreigners, against criminals
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.920]  who are domestic enemies, foreign and domestic. That's why we have the militia.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.960]  And you're going to be talking more about this in the fourth hour today after the ask
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:05.920]  me anything. And folks, I let the dog out to leash. That's not fake when I get angry,
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:09.280]  but it's how I really feel. So I'm letting it out for illustrative purposes. So it's
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:13.080]  real, but it's not. Yeah, it's 95% real. But the fact that I'm letting myself out.
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:17.120]  But I mean, he really is a thug. He really has done horrible things to me on air, you
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.280]  know, where he says, we have a problem with men and molesting women. And they cut to the
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.640]  clip of me talking about something totally different. I mean, he really, really gets
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.520]  me angry, man. When you claim I'm abusing women, I mean, you really got a problem. Then you
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.320]  try to escape the Second Amendment. Try to feed off your audience. You try to go around
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.680]  bullying everybody. You bully your listeners. That's why nobody listened to you. You're
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.880]  a failure, Bill O'Reilly. Excuse me. Thank you, David. You're coming up in the fourth
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:46.240]  hour. God bless you. Alex, okay. Alex, can I say one more thing? It's not just Bill
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:50.600]  O'Reilly. It's Gretchen Carlson. And I know you're there in the Caribbean, but she was
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:55.680]  just dumping on the Second Amendment as well. And even arguing with people on Twitter saying,
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:59.720]  Hey, the Second Amendment was written before guns were invented. I mean, that's what we're
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:02.520]  getting from Fox News continuously. I just had to throw that at him.
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:09.560]  That's about the Chinese 800 years ago. And then they were adopted 600 years ago in Italy
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:13.600]  and then into Spain. I mean, that is the biggest load of crap I've ever heard. Well, the American
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:17.520]  Revolution started when they went to get the guns, but I guess Gretchen didn't understand
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.520]  that.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.240]  Spain, there weren't even 240 years ago. Yeah, that's right. That's right. She said that
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.080]  is before the Second Amendment was written before guns were invented. That's what she
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:33.640]  said on Twitter. So, you know, April 19th, they, they went to get the guns and the cannons
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.560]  from the Patriots. So, yeah.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:42.760]  Oh, my God, this is, I didn't even know that. I'm only doing this one more time. I'm just
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:45.160]  giving one more break. Thank you, David, because I'm going to the collars. That's no more this
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:51.640]  week. I'm a bad person. The Tim Kennedy Special Lens today, 15% off Supermobility and Sigrid
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.480]  12. And of course, the other great product, a brain force in the tropic and 75% off Hillary
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:59.520]  for President's Church, just because they're already a bestseller. I just want them everywhere.
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.960]  I want to incentivize every listener getting a Hillary for President's Church in Fuller
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.560]  Store.com. Okay, 75% off on the second chair, 50% off on the first. Okay, I apologize to
[01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:16.320]  Michelle or is that Michael and Graham and Kirk and Christine and John, everybody else.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.080]  Let's go to Graham. Okay. Graham, what do you think? I mean, they're trying to kill in the
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:23.680]  media says killing. They've already foiled several attempts that are getting very, very
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.040]  close. Do you think it'll be assassinated? What will happen to me? Yes. Well, I do think
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.600]  that there's a, obviously a chance they'll be assassinated. You've already had a couple
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:37.520]  of attempts to one recently in Vegas. Well, one thing too on the O'Reilly clip where you
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.080]  were just talking about that PC, did you didn't mention that they artificially had your face
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.640]  turned red with haze coming around your ears, represent smoke, I suppose. And the fact that
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:53.240]  O'Reilly himself was sued for sexual harassment. There's no such, you know, case with you.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:51:00.600]  And so it's amazing that the media hypocrisy in terms of the Trump potential assassination,
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.880]  I'll tell you, I thought, I'm a listener and I thought, you know, you might be exaggerating
[01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.520]  a little bit with what the protesters are like. I thought these rallies, I did go to
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:14.440]  the Greensboro rally, the Greensboro speech and the people inside were very calm and polite.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:18.960]  You know, there were patriotic people wearing American flag shirts and mull on the base
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:24.160]  shirts, you know, were, you know, exercising their right to free speech peacefully. But
[01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:28.760]  you know, I've got the raw footage of all of this. There were two protesters inside
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:33.400]  that were hauled off. The folks inside are really nice about it. Trump didn't say anything
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:39.240]  stupid on the stage. Anyway, I went outside and it was absolute mayhem. The protesters
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:44.720]  in the street, you know, people with pink hair holding up swastikas, signs with swastikas
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:50.320]  saying, Trump is Hitler. I went up and interviewed some of them and they were, it was amazing
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.120]  to see that they were shaking the police car. One of them got arrested, tackled on the ground
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.720]  and then arrested. We've got footage, I've got footage of all that. And so, you know,
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:05.480]  you saw the the paradox of what the media portrays versus what the reality is on the
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:06.480]  ground.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.360]  There's these wonderful angels outside while the Nazis are inside. Oh, there's liberals
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.040]  who are so smart they can hardly even talk. I don't care if they're black or white or
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:20.360]  his, these are the dumbest, lying, exaggerating people. So let me ask you the question. As
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.960]  the left goes into this pure overdrive of organizing the idiots they've created into
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:30.560]  a massive anti-free speech demons, what do you think in your gut? I mean, I really, I
[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:34.520]  in my gut, I know there's going to be a scene of a guy firing a rifle, a handgun you name
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:39.320]  it at Trump. And then they're going to say he deserved it. He was pro gun. I mean, I
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:44.240]  can hear it now. I mean, my gut tells me they're going to come very close to killing him. My
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:48.360]  gut tells me they're going to get shots off. I just, I know it's going to happen. What
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:49.360]  do you think?
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:53.000]  Right now, but I would say right now it doesn't even matter what their background is. They're
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.800]  just trying to get people wound up with their 180 degree inversion of reality that they've
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:01.600]  got going on. And so it doesn't, you know, they're just hoping right now mindlessly that
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.000]  some idiot on the street will pull the gun out and they will. They've already tried it.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.020]  But, you know, in the coming months, if nothing's done and they can't get him, can't get a wind
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:13.320]  up to where, you know, some freak on the street, the killing, then they'll start looking at
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:17.840]  backgrounds and, you know, trying to play them off even more, fully more strange. And
[01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.840]  if that doesn't work,
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.640]  It's a weirdos and saccada facilities and stuff that they can activate. That's been
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.320]  declassified. Great points. God bless you. And I'm only bringing this up because this
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:31.160]  guy almost got him. He almost got the gun away. He almost was able to get some shots
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:32.160]  off.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:35.520]  And I just really see them. I hate to give them ideas because I think sometimes I'm
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:39.120]  predicting stuff, but I think I may be actually giving them ideas. But let's just say you
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:43.960]  can really think about some scenarios to demonize certain guns. And then somebody goes after
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:49.960]  a Trump rally basically from a distance. I'm going to stop right there. But the problem
[01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:54.560]  is leftist are so dumb and so, I don't want to say a feminine because it insults women.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:59.640]  They're so pathetic and so delusional. Like this guy from England thought he'd be the
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:04.240]  superhero and get the gun away from the cop, you know, and just, I mean, they're so out
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:08.320]  of control. One point they're so inept. I think, okay, they're not able to do it. But
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:12.960]  then you crowd source enough people, they're going to find some weird leftist veteran or
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:17.600]  just just God knows what they're going to do or scapegoat some veteran. I just, oh,
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.720]  I don't want to say the scenarios. I'm going to stop right now. I'm going to just shut
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:25.640]  up right now. I need to shut up. Don't I? Let's go ahead. Thank you, caller. Let's talk to
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:28.600]  Michael in West Virginia. You're on the air worldwide. Go ahead.
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:30.600]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:32.600]  Good, brother.
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:38.120]  I'd just like to start off to say that I'm a first time caller, a big fan of the show.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:43.520]  I actually, just to get this out of the way, stumbled across you through a YouTube channel.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:49.360]  The fellow's name was Michael Stroop. S-T-R-O-U-P has a Canadian goose as his avatar. But anyway,
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:55.320]  he speaks the truth a lot like you do. And I think what this country is in grave danger.
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.680]  A lot of the points that you're speaking on is true. I do believe there will be an assassination
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:05.840]  that's, I think it will probably, my gut feeling is it will happen. And it'll probably be masterminded
[01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:12.520]  by the great puppets of this nation and brought out. And it will probably happen.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:16.040]  And then what happens if Trump is assassinated?
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.640]  I think there will be a great turmoil going on. I mean, where else can we go after, you
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.280]  know, that's happened? Where will we be led from there? I mean, it's, the media is just
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:29.840]  the biggest hypocrites. They don't like truth. Like, you speak the truth and your fellow's
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:32.920]  like you speak the truth and they don't like the truth. You know, it exposes them and they
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:36.720]  hate being exposed. And the more that this stuff happens and these false flags needs
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.560]  attacked, more exposure and they're not liking it. One bit.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.240]  Well, you're right. The globalists are losing power. They're losing control because thinking
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.600]  people know their scams. The problem is they've been successful in the earlier phase of
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:55.480]  dumbing folks down. So it's a paradox of maybe 20, 30% of people that are somewhat awake
[01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:00.400]  versus 50% that are totally dumb. Another 20% or so, they're kind of in the middle.
[01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.880]  And it's just such a crazy time to be alive. God bless you. And I agree with you, Michael.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:08.720]  Appreciate that call. Kirk in PA, you're on the air worldwide. Go ahead, sir.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.880]  Hi, Alex. Good. Thank you.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:24.200]  Well, I think they want to instill this idea of having the public to, you know, start hating
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:31.000]  Trump on a massive level, just like they have the Muslim, the hating gay men.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:38.360]  Yes, I think that's exactly where they're going. What else do you think about the situation?
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:45.760]  Well, I think, you know, if they, if they are successful in grabbing the guns, how will
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:50.200]  they be able, I mean, if they see a rise in the violence, I mean, how will they be able
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:55.880]  to obtain the gun back? Because what they'll do is they'll first say a certain class is
[01:56:55.880 --> 01:57:00.320]  banned, only a certain like, like one type of semi-auto so they can just test demonizing
[01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:04.560]  that group, taking their guns. And then, oh, terrorist hit that are associated with the
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:07.480]  gun group. Now we're going to ban even more guns. And they're just going to create so
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:11.640]  many riots and so much turmoil and so much civil unrest, maybe even turn the electricity
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:16.480]  off for a few weeks until people just capitulate and are so domesticated, they say, fine, we'll
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.080]  turn our guns in. And then that'll start a civil war because there's a certain percentage
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:24.000]  getting going to do it. And I think that's the larger plan.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:31.760]  Yeah. But I also think that, you know, it's not going to be that I know there's a lot
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:35.320]  of people that want to kill Trump. That's on the other side. But I when I was looking
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:40.560]  at your interviews on and I was seeing there's a lot of Trump supporters that say, you know,
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:44.000]  that if Trump doesn't become president, then that's it for the country. So if they would
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.400]  see somebody, look, look, look, look, look, there's bots, there's people out there posing
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:52.120]  as Trump supporters saying a lot of bad stuff. There are some bad people that are Trump supporters
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:55.720]  were a nation of 330 million people. Look, I'm not perfect. Trump's not perfect. You're
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:58:00.440]  absolutely right. There's problems on both sides. You are absolutely right.
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:09.600]  Yeah, I just, I just hope there's still life in this country. You know, well, I know this.
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:17.720]  Look, a nation of sheep will be robot wolves. A nation of brain damaged, domesticated idiots
[01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:23.200]  will fall. I mean, it's not going to be robot wolves. It's going to fall. And the whole
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.160]  Western world, I mean, look, most countries got smart people, but they're collapsing because
[01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:31.240]  there's corruption and people don't stand up for basic freedom. Look at Venezuela. Look
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:35.280]  at Mexico. You name it. And that's where we're going. That'll be worse. A big rich nation's
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:44.360]  fall. It's explosive. It's scary. It's out of control. Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:27.000]  Inclusion part two of my Ask Me Anything interview with the fans and viewers of Reddit. They're
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.360]  over on the Donald channel. In fact, Buckley, what's the exact URL? It's Donald underscore
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:39.000]  D underscore Donald. That is coming up with the top thing on Reddit in those Ask Me Anythings
[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.240]  that day. We did a live last week at night. We're airing in here and then David Knight
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:47.600]  comes in live in the fourth hour of a right now. Right back to your calls. I want to go
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:53.200]  to John and Christine and at least Pam in this segment. John Arkansas, you're on the
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:01:04.840]  air. Thanks for holding. I've been listening since the shortwave days, way back there,
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:13.120]  but I'm sure you're aware of this, but I haven't heard the term. It was a term that I learned
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:20.760]  from Fletcher Proudy and it's called demographic warfare. Yes, that's what they're doing. It's
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:28.840]  a broken coalition strategy, Balkanization. That's what we should call it. That's exactly
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:37.160]  what they're doing. Race warm management, but you're right. Demographic warfare. Yes,
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:42.040]  sir. Tell us what Fletcher Proudy exposed. Go ahead. Well, I mean, basically it was
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:48.960]  so ironic that, you know, you had the Tonkin Chinese and the coach in Chinese and by the
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:54.680]  time our government got through shipping them around and messing with them, you had basically
[02:01:54.680 --> 02:02:02.600]  the communists ruling South Vietnam and us in there trying to kill the natives, the farmers
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:10.440]  of South Vietnam. So I mean, just a perfect globalist coup. They've been laughing about
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:16.440]  that and joined that for years and years and years and they're doing it here. Basically,
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:24.360]  if it goes on, it will be the, the foreigners running the place and hunting down the natives
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:31.640]  and that's, but he, well, I lived in Arkansas for years and years and I think what we're,
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:36.920]  as Americans, what we're committing is called demographic Arkansas.
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:46.680]  Ah, calling a new term. Well, we lived under Arkansas, but it was like, you know, you commit
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:53.640]  suicide by cutting your head off or shoot yourself six times with 12 gauge. That's Arkansas,
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:58.600]  but, but this is demographic Arkansas. We're doing it to ourselves. We got it. We got it.
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:04.080]  Well, don't forget sometimes people cut their arms and legs off and pour gasoline on themselves.
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:10.320]  We did have one case of that and I'm sure, you know, that there's been, there were some
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:14.720]  bizarre suicides that seem to go along with these people.
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.880]  Oh, now the Clintons never heard anybody. John, they love us.
[02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:25.560]  Well, I don't believe they did. But I, and you know, I'm being real here. They attract
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:37.040]  zealots who, who do do those things and their minions do that for a pat on the head or a
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:40.960]  bone. Do you think they're going to try to kill Trump?
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:46.360]  They don't have any choice. I'm not saying the Clintons. I'm saying that the higher
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:50.600]  up, the, yeah, I don't see it. If it goes on like it's going, they don't, they don't
[02:03:50.600 --> 02:03:55.040]  have a choice. They, you know, they'd rather call back and make a great point. Let's go
[02:03:55.040 --> 02:03:59.160]  real quick to Pam. No, no, Pam had been home the longest. Christine Washington. Christine,
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:00.160]  go ahead.
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.160]  It was.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.160]  It was.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:03.160]  It was.
[02:04:03.160 --> 02:04:08.360]  It was on the radio. Christine, we're almost out of time. Go ahead.
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:09.880]  That for a time.
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:15.160]  We're out of time. Listen, Pam and Christine, Steve and Scott will put your numbers down

[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:27.720]  questions. We should continue this, this, this after they ask me anything. Cause I'm
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:31.880]  asking you, will they try to kill Donald Trump? Obviously they're already trying to. The media
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.040]  is hyping it. There's an assassination attempt. This is getting serious. What will happen if
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:39.720]  that happens? That's the bigger question. That's coming up after they asked me anything
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:46.920]  in 55 minutes. Briefly, the Tim Kennedy 50% off special on super mail on secret 12 and

[02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:24.040]  to reach out to different internet demographics of folks that are somewhat awake but not really
[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:29.160]  tuned in on a regular basis in the broadcast. This is part of our outreach to go into areas
[02:08:29.160 --> 02:08:34.160]  where people are debating political issues and to try to bring them to the info war to
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:39.320]  give them a different or wider perspective. It's also key to understand with more and
[02:08:39.320 --> 02:08:44.160]  more internet censorship happening and the police banning public speakers in Florida
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:48.320]  that would dare criticize Islam and things like that. It is more important than ever
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:53.560]  that we all interconnect with each other that we all stay connected and defend each other's
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:58.640]  free speech as Benjamin Franklin said hang together or hang separate and it's really

[02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:29.880]  asked you to be vice president vice president yet with no but Donald Trump did ask me to
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:35.560]  marry him last night no no seriously no but I I do think it's Jeff sessions as the smart
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:40.560]  money's on senator sessions so there's your serious answer on that question so you wouldn't
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:46.760]  say yes to the VP nod I have little you guys go that would build bills around here no the
[02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:53.840]  VP doesn't pay enough or have any power so I would I'm a TSA I have power no no seriously
[02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:59.600]  he's not doing that would be a good VP choice was hypothetical so Bilbo Davins 32 says thanks
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:04.240]  for joining us today Mr. Jones your concerns as to the new world order is slightly confusing
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:10.080]  when you hire former strat for employees such as Molly Moroney to work within your organization
[02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:14.680]  can you explain why you would allow someone so close to the DoD and the secret government
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:19.680]  you supposedly seek to take down to work for you in an editorial capacity editorial capacity
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:25.280]  really well and she's so close to that okay she is you know that was that was a really
[02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:29.840]  sad thing we try to put a magazine out for free locally we charge people to buy and
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:35.280]  bulk and this girl was right out of college and there's only a few places to work when
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.440]  you get an internship that'd be like this big analyst private group it's here in Austin
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:47.160]  Texas or at UT or for other places and we thought it was a plus on her resume and then
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:50.040]  she gets here and she's all she's doing is taking our articles and pasting them into
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:54.080]  a format to put a magazine and people are calling her up going you're a secret government
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:58.880]  agent he's a horrible person her dad calls him go should I sue him he's a big lawyer
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.520]  in town I said no sir it doesn't matter there's schizophrenics you know please don't but she
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:09.480]  quit over it and don't worry the magazine's gone you were successful trolling that one
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:15.400]  but this is the craziness Tim Kennedy has been in 15 years in black ops he's Delta Force
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:22.560]  we admit all that and no one attacks him but Tim Kennedy's doing reports for us he's
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.840]  a patriot he's a guy that's exposed our government funding ISIS he's a guy that's exposed the
[02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:32.200]  attack on the Bill of Rights and Constitution he exposed the military being used out in
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:38.160]  Oregon against the Bundy's I mean just because somebody's worked in the government or in
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:43.600]  a group affiliated with it doesn't mean they're bad if they have a good track record but as
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:48.200]  for poor sweet Molly she was like an intern she was like in a building down the street
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:52.600]  like with a few other folks doing the magazine and we go out of the magazine because it was
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.440]  successful but bang for your buck I could put out a YouTube video and have ten times
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:02.960]  the views and spending a month on a magazine it was a test we did but man they just seize
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:09.000]  on that and they go you know oh my god meanwhile the Stratford emails got hacked by WikiLeaks
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.480]  that's true and Stratford's like bad balding me how do we stop Jones how do we do all the
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:17.440]  they were this is proof he works for them they put this out to make him look good it's
[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:26.520]  like we're promoting free speech second amendment family you judge the show by what we do you
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:32.600]  know not about but this is this is the schizophrenia and a loser culture because they want to imagine
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:39.040]  everything's controlled they couldn't ever actually get involved and change the world
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:42.520]  because everything's controlled and you know I here's they don't think you put your freaking
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.920]  boots on by yourself here's the best thing here's the best thing is I just refreshed
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.720]  the question and it says edit the presenter moi buckley Hammond working with Alex Jones
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:54.360]  just blatantly ducked this question without even Alan allowing Alex to hear the text of
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.040]  the comment because apparently I was reading a different one but so anyway we answered
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:05.680]  you just involved yourself in the evil operation we put a movie out about Israeli involvement
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:11.920]  nine eleven and they all flipped out ten times worse because you don't talk about it enough
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:18.000]  all the time no no you make a movie about it you're covering it up you know that works
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  you answer the guy's questions because this was just about it isn't about saving civilization
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:31.840]  or society it's about at your keyboard being bigger that I don't show see oh you just you
[02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:37.560]  just plan don't you wish we got orders from transfer well no apparently in order to work
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.120]  here you have to get CIA clearance that's the new thing I'm getting trolled on and we're
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:45.760]  like really if that was true why did I have to just submit all of our information in order
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:54.360]  to get clearance to go to the DNC you know it's like changing the subject we're patriots
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.760]  exposing the globalist but the globalists have so turned the public and the mentally
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:04.000]  ill chumps their jobs done they can't even respond but we're here like here's water in
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  the desert shut up you with the you with the such and such take a selfie the thing that's
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:14.680]  pretty amazing is that they're putting out this information to prove that we're disinfo
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.440]  agents meanwhile what they're putting out is nothing but disinfo so are they government
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:24.240]  sock pump but I agree meanwhile we're taping two hours of this to next week air some excerpts
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.920]  that won't even put this on the air I'm not a schizophrenic mental patient it's not this
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:35.320]  is powerful info am I driving along in Albuquerque on an affiliate or New York or LA we're on
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:41.760]  affiliates here's all this schizophrenic crazy crap Jones proved you're not working for
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:48.520]  the CIA I mean it's like what the hell and the weird part is they never actually when
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:54.360]  we talk about real CIA stuff they don't respond to that it's all like hypothetical schizophrenic
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:58.280]  listen take your medication you're gonna be a lot better all right well let's try to run
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:02.120]  through some of these questions yeah let's get some non-schizophrenic questions here Trump
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.880]  is my daddy says hey Alex what is the number one quality that Donald Trump possesses in
[02:15:06.880 --> 02:15:11.800]  your opinion that will win him the presidency that's a good question it's not giving into
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:17.560]  peer pressure it's having his own political will his own compass and realizing the globalist
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:24.960]  propaganda matrix is a giant facade about to collapse okay in Jones attorney two eight
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:29.360]  one three zero zero four says globalism is trashing the middle class of the first world
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:32.840]  doesn't that erode the buying power of the same people who shop at walmart use facebook
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:36.560]  and google and otherwise consume the products of blue chip corporations and tech titans
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:40.760]  that seems to cut against the economic motivations for globalism so what is the real motivation
[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:45.720]  for globalist control or is it just an emergent force that is that is the sum of self-interested
[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:52.920]  actors at the top wow that's person to have a radio show what they said at the end is
[02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:59.840]  true it is self-interested actors battling with each other but they agree into a stricture
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:06.280]  or a structure of how they do the robbing to protect themselves and to organize it so
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:11.960]  as to the proletariat never waking up and saying no to so all revolutionist brand is
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.880]  left to the stand you know whenever discuss the scams at walmart's running so there is
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:22.600]  a global government cosmology global government system that's based on these crony capitalist
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:28.920]  robber barons ruling over people and controlling them and consolidating power but it's driven
[02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:35.000]  by their individual need to dominate and take control even though as they take control and
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.920]  destroy economies they're building a technocracy that will be their own downfall makes sense
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:46.640]  yep i understood that let's screw that i must work for the cia that's all that matters forget
[02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:52.240]  actually doing anything about anything just to say allege jones is evil he works for pop
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.000]  the magic dragon all right instead of actually doing anything to see attacking me is the
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:04.960]  is the kickoff it's the point it's the i can't deal with this my chicken on there i can't
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:09.240]  deal with this i'm just gonna say that somebody trying to warm me's a bad guy it's kind of
[02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:15.960]  like that like we're losing oxygen the spacecraft shut up agent falls over and dies till the
[02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:20.280]  next point oh we have the chicken video they're showing it to us let us know it's there yeah
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:24.040]  is that should we air the chicken video listen this is why this happened they were asking

[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:46.120]  people that have anthem or black and they said it's racist no if you live in the south eat

[02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:55.400]  black people in fact get away black people i'm eating all myself but in the mental illness
[02:17:55.400 --> 02:18:03.240]  paradigm it becomes we're racist exactly do we have that queued up everything is racist
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:08.840]  everything is racist when you're part of the team let's play the lego racist fried chicken

[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:55.000]  how john says racist randy's fried chicken god he works for strafford here we go singular idoc says
[02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.840]  as in austin night i have watched you off and on since your days on public access tv in the late
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:03.240]  90s and i've always thought 90 percent of your conspiracy stuff was bs but thought it was interesting
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:08.520]  because if even 10 percent 10 percent of it is true it is pretty scary how do you feel about
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:12.600]  the fact that someone like myself who still feels you're a bit out there now sees info wars as a
[02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:20.760]  more legitimate news outlet than most of the msm well look it shows that globalism has progressed
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.920]  unfortunately i was pretty much accurate about what i predicted i was reading globalist white
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:30.840]  papers they told us what their plan was so it's not hard to be accurate and i get as a good person
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:35.400]  people out there don't believe this because you see the world through your eyes so you wouldn't do
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:41.560]  this why would somebody else do it but i think our own naivete is what is empowering us and so i
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:47.720]  would just encourage everybody out there to get involved and research things for yourself and decide
[02:19:47.720 --> 02:20:01.720]  whether you want to let the globalists make decisions for you or not hunters anglers campers

[02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.720]  logo 0802 says hey there alex thank you for coming by to answer our questions
[02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:23.960]  lately there's a bit of big influx of whisperings and rumors about obama possibly declaring
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:28.520]  marshal law most likely around election time in reaction to the riots to be staged by various
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:32.840]  hate groups while i personally don't think this is likely i'm curious on your thoughts about this
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:38.360]  and how the election itself will play out in general i'd rather ask princess diana what she
[02:24:38.360 --> 02:24:43.480]  thinks i just don't think that they're going to try and pull anything like that until they can
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:50.120]  get us to give up our guns that just like what happened in venezuela they disarmed the population
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:55.720]  only four years ago and you see what happened as soon as they were able to tell everyone
[02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:59.720]  oh it's time for us to use the only people who should have guns or the police and they'll protect
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:05.240]  us no and and then you see it's they knew that a collapse was coming and they collapsed their
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:11.240]  country and that's what they want to do here with us that's why after this every terror attack
[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:14.840]  that's the first thing they talk about they won't mention radical islam because i'm sorry
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:18.600]  if you're going to be shipping a bunch of radicals uh the last thing i'm going to do
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:25.400]  is give you my guns the hell that's a good point what was the question buckling the question was
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:30.280]  and i kind of scrolled back past this but basically um they were asking about whether
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:36.040]  or not obama is going to uh create marshal law uh around the time of the election and what do you
[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:41.880]  think whether he can stay the president europe has declared a civil emergency in germany and
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:46.680]  france and a few other countries have criticized as long as they arrest you so they won't call it
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.240]  marshal law they'll call the civil emergency and i thought you know he's just a puppet he's going to
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:55.880]  go away they'll put somebody new in but i think if they are concerned and think donald trump's really
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:26:01.880]  going to get in they got their george soros activated kill the cops you know type groups out there
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:06.120]  not the cops are perfect the point is we want to just randomly go out and kill cops
[02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:11.160]  have a civil war there is a plan to destabilize the country and i think it's really seriously
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:15.400]  being looked at on the drawing board by these delusional elites i think that's a great question
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:19.640]  i mean i think i think it's in the cards i don't think it's going to happen i hope it
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:23.160]  isn't going to happen it's definitely i think it's up to us to speak out and say don't do this
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:27.640]  it's definitely in the cards that's been in the plan sure but it's you know they can't engage it
[02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:32.440]  until they can get our guns exactly exactly the point we have nitrogen sport says alex i think
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.440]  the globalists have even more to gain if trump becomes president because they can simply crash
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:41.160]  the economy stage a few terror attacks and then use trump as an example of why nationalism slash
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:45.800]  conservatism isn't practical anymore this would make it extremely difficult for another nationalist
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:50.280]  to become president what are your thoughts on that that's one of my biggest concerns but then i
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:58.040]  lean back and say justice be done by the ebb and fall they don't want trump in despite the fact they
[02:26:58.040 --> 02:27:03.160]  could try that playbook because they know he'll fight back and expose that they're the ones behind
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:08.920]  the collapse so if they were into that scenario which i can see is plausible they would be a
[02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:15.080]  supporting trump to get in so they could actually play that out i think they know is too much of
[02:27:15.080 --> 02:27:20.040]  a wall guard they don't control him whether he's good or bad they don't control him that's why
[02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:25.880]  they're scared of him what do you think man scared of trump well i i do think that they're
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:30.600]  they're not going to it's not like the globalists are just going to shrink away oh well we lost oh
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:36.280]  we tried it it times times up it's over they're not going to go away so that's i mean we have to
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:43.640]  stay vigilant absolutely so trash cat tm says do you think once trump is elected that the globalist
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:48.200]  will fund a civil war to break out between la raza trying to make america mexico again
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.920]  and the real americans once trump starts cracking down on deporting illegal immigrants that's sure
[02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:57.080]  i mean i don't want to just say la raza and all that's the key to the globalist takeover but
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:02.680]  they fund all forms of division around the world with sociology and then play on that in times of
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:07.720]  crisis so yes the globalists can just move offshore for a while all they break the country down
[02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:13.960]  bringing civil war and try to get control out of that it's a real threat um let's see another question
[02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:19.000]  chromatic dra says let's be honest you and your reporters endanger your lives to give us this
[02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.920]  information you're considered a leader in inspiration many of us if you or your reporters
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:27.640]  become illegally detained or make the ultimate sacrifice what should we know or do to carry on
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:32.200]  the fight you got a bunch of intimidators out there that just try to scream and yell we're
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:36.200]  going to kill you and the feminist oh well he love you as long put bags on her head so sexually
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:42.520]  mutilators we love you oh alex is bad oh my god i'm so horrible but but to be totally serious
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:50.520]  there is an attack on the press not just us but all over the world and when you promote info wars
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:56.040]  when you promote lian's videos you promote matt drudge links you promote world net daily
[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:01.080]  whatever the case is you're countering that you are the resistance you're the real power
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:05.720]  we're just watching on the wall pointing out stuff at a higher position i guess it's going on
[02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:10.760]  and giving you intel but you're at other positions above and below as well giving us intel so you're
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:16.920]  we're all just the same symbiotically as a species resisting this attempt to take over lian
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:22.840]  well i agree people just need to put as much information that's why they want to take over
[02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:27.160]  the internet and be able to control it and corral you into certain areas right they're pushing
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:43.080]  internet taxes internet on these all this is an anthem they want to control you
[02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:56.200]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:24.120]  to enhance funding for an existing gun background check system which needed 60 votes to pass the
[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:31.320]  final vote tally was 53 to 47 the second vote was on a measure by senator christ murphy to expand
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:38.600]  gun background checks and close the so-called gun show loophole the final vote tally was 44 to 56
[02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:43.960]  republican senator john cornyn of texas pushed a measure that would allow the government to

[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:44.520]  so please stay with us i'm alex jones and this is the info war strong heart says alex help i work
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:48.920]  in education and honestly i'm fearful of my future career because i align myself with truth and i'm
[02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:54.040]  not afraid to speak with my mind speak by mind of my students what step should i take to try and
[02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:59.080]  undo the harm done to easily manipulated children so that they can get a proper education without a
[02:33:59.080 --> 02:34:05.320]  regressive indoctrination all while not having my head on a spike well you're there with your
[02:34:05.320 --> 02:34:11.640]  particular federal u n unesco curriculum but i would just get the children you know in times
[02:34:11.640 --> 02:34:17.480]  you have a space to like poems about free will ideas about free will explain to them that what
[02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:21.960]  you're getting is a particular state run view and they should talk to their parents about how to
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:28.120]  interpret all this i would ask to meet with the parents children just as a study hold and then
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:32.360]  bring up are you concerned about the curriculum and ally yourself with the parents then you'll
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:37.080]  have real support and i think you'll find even higher up above you in education people are scared
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:42.440]  to concerned and so it's that active resistance i think you have to be ready to put your head on
[02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:51.480]  the spike to free humanity but do it in a wise smart way so just probe things and i think you
[02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:58.120]  have the answers innately that's a good point here's a question by mlg it's a little long but
[02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.960]  let's let's push through it thank you for doing this am a in the work you do to give
[02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:05.400]  alternative narrative in the news i've been a reader of your website and reports for quite
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:10.120]  some time several years ago i came until several years ago when i came across your report on
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:15.800]  ashton ludenby i was in an interesting position as a second hand witness to the crimes he committed
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:20.360]  and later pled guilty to so when i read your report i was surprised at how wrong the report was
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:24.520]  compared to what really happened that it caused me to question your priorities of what appears to
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:30.120]  be choosing sensationalism over journalistic integrity and independent research as you took
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:35.000]  the suspect's mother's word at faith and later stated was mistake the source of your information
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.320]  was biased and misguided but you did not vet the source before reporting the information as fact
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.960]  so my question for you with all due respect is how have you improved as a journalist since then
[02:35:43.960 --> 02:35:47.800]  and how can i have faith in your reporting on other stories knowing about what appeared to me
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:52.120]  as a sensationalist reporting in the past thank you again for your time well i don't think you
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:56.120]  should have faith in my reporting i never told you to have faith i told you think for yourself
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:04.600]  i don't know these names are hampni domti isher bunny santa claus uh purple unicorns a long time
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:10.600]  ago you know that eat eat glitter in the morning for breakfast with their Cheerios
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:17.400]  i have a bunch of different reporters and writers and researchers and a lot of what we do is you
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:25.880]  see some story and we put a link to it so to sit there and say what about luden's cough drops or
[02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:33.160]  whatever it is what did you do why'd you quote their mother i mean you know it's news i mean if i
[02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:38.680]  say there was a plane crash an hour after it happened and a day later new info comes out well
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:44.600]  what does that mean in general we tell the truth we don't try to deceive in general we have a bias
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:50.360]  to tell the truth and promote liberty uh and can you pick all sorts of examples of stuff we get wrong
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:56.280]  or articles we link to they get corrected later absolutely fricking lootily but we're not here
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:03.800]  trying uh to lie to people uh as for whatever weird cockamamie story you brought up that's like
[02:37:03.800 --> 02:37:10.280]  chinese you know dragon talk to me i have no idea what you were even talking about i mean someone
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:17.000]  was like you didn't answer the charges to this are you a government agent i'm like oh no i do
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:22.520]  want freedom though though i did turn out all their offers i mean you know it because there
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:28.840]  are bunch of scumbags and stab you in the back i mean i i just don't get it the compendium of what
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:36.360]  we do and what we stand for is clear and people have to i mean no one has reporters here that have
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:41.000]  as much freedom as our people do we hire folks that we think love freedom and want to tell the truth
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:45.720]  and i may disagree with some stuff they do sometime they disagree with me this is real freedom i believe
[02:37:45.720 --> 02:37:51.560]  in humanity uh and and and and folks that have never been part of that i get why you can't believe
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:55.320]  there's anybody out there that's independent and doing something real but i'm going to tell you folks
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:38:01.400]  this is it i'm real all the way 110 percent and uh so that's what it comes down to but just the
[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:07.560]  subject always being changed to me i got like 40 something employees 10 or 15 contractors i reach
[02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:14.120]  a lot of people but i don't really run anything and no one wants to talk about how we've been signed
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:18.040]  on to trillions and derivatives or how we've been signed on to trillions and dead or how we're
[02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:24.520]  launching new wars or starting war with russia it's just all about the looting people you did
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:28.920]  something and the woman mother met them and you didn't do a better job of what you happened for
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:34.760]  and to the other and i speak to the schizophrenics out there because i care about you you know i
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.480]  understand it's a crazy world and you're you're paranoid and stuff but we're not the focus of it
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:46.760]  we didn't do it i didn't hurt the easter bunny yeah well i think too this happened i guess 2009 so
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:53.240]  it's uh the usa patriot act being used against a 16 year old and so obviously this was something that
[02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:58.200]  we were really probably one of the only people who were reporting well you shouldn't use the
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:03.400]  usa patriot act that claim it was for terrorism right and so if you're pointing out to this story
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:08.680]  and you want to report on it and you know there they say that later maybe you got some new information
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:13.720]  and but if something happens you better record on it seven years ago i mean what what where do you
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:19.640]  go to listen would you have like two people working for you then they said like five they said
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:26.920]  homeland security was for terrorism and they're using it for marijuana cases so i i stand by what i
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:35.320]  said okay so ekkj says do you think a new assault band assault weapons band would actually happen
[02:39:35.320 --> 02:39:38.680]  i love my guns and i'm concerned that the sissy's might break us down this time
[02:39:38.680 --> 02:39:43.800]  well they have jihadi said another 10 targets and they're going to say conservatives and
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:48.760]  gunners did it yeah they're coming for our same business they've got a un treaty worldwide
[02:39:48.760 --> 02:39:55.800]  where they've taken the guns except here are they gonna let us have guns they're gonna try not to
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:01.480]  they're coming for the guns but never mind the luden story i did battle on it seven years
[02:40:01.480 --> 02:40:06.120]  ago so mammoth the mario says hi alex what is your daily schedule like and also do you think
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:09.640]  roger stone will have a position that he already has roger already answered that he said no he's
[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:13.000]  not going to have a position he's too much of a libertine he doesn't want to be in the
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.720]  trombone house yeah so that uh mammoth the mario says hi alex what is your daily schedule like
[02:40:18.680 --> 02:40:26.680]  insane not really i sit here with lian this i look pretty tired right now lian's over here
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:31.320]  in her green outfit that's why you're normally in bed by now buckley's wearing a stunning cream
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:37.320]  colored jacket if you're ready to listen thank you um i get up about 6 30 get in the shower
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:43.800]  go out wake my kids up make breakfast either have a nanny send them to school or i take them to school
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:50.360]  that i take quick jog let's wait for about 30 45 minutes do about an hour research drive into the
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  office do the show do more research shoot a few videos do some management stuff mainly try to
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:59.880]  decide how to get money to fund the operation look at everything i don't want to do that but
[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:05.880]  that's why you have to fuel the operation uh deal whatever fires are going on uh and then i uh go
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:13.160]  home hang out with the children go for a hike with them on the green belt after dinner watch maybe a
[02:41:13.160 --> 02:41:18.360]  tv show play a board game go to bed not that exciting mainly walk into a star chamber and go
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:25.240]  give me your orders new world order you know the answer has exposed everything we're doing oh yes
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:31.240]  so first you wake up every day and get all of your instructions from the jews and the cia and then
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:37.480]  you go about your day we kind of cool the jews will come in here run everything for me uh i think
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:43.160]  that i mean the end of the atl attacking me constantly but whatever so odoxel has a question
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:47.320]  it says where in your opinion did the overarching globalist conspiracy begin with the rockevillars
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:52.440]  the Rothschilds charles darwin and francis galton in your in your movie in game it seems like it
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:56.920]  begins with the eugenics movement what was the true genesis of the plan well you had a british
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:01.160]  empire kind of run by the rothschilds by that time and they did have a way to scientifically
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:07.080]  manage populations they were smart so they invested in hundreds of different groups
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:12.680]  in the anana kingdom but also well then it was England and also in europe and france other areas
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:17.640]  to create scientific tools of control and there were books on it they launched modern psychology
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:24.920]  all of it and it's it's just been all about turning us into jellyfish ever since octopus
[02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:30.200]  brian says how will people survive the increasing rates of automation will new jobs be formed will
[02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:34.920]  we see the rise of socialism through welfare such as universal basic income corporate dystopia
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:40.200]  with the middle class fusing with the lower class well that's a good question we've always pointed
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:45.160]  out they want us on welfare to control us and now we have the precariat the builderbergs announcing
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:50.120]  and saying we're going to give you a subsistence level money to control you but we're going to
[02:42:50.120 --> 02:42:55.640]  socially tell you take the vaccines get sterilized live the life we say follow the religion we say
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:00.760]  have the speech we say don't cause trouble on the internet and don't have kids then you die
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:06.360]  and now they've social engineered who has children and this is 21st century warfare
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:11.800]  how you conquer humanity and this is the essence of my mission to expose what we're now witnessing
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:18.440]  it's like alex did you hear they're going to use welfare to control us oh wow i never talked
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:23.800]  about that before i was too busy working for the cia that's trying to destroy me in the media
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:29.320]  yeah watch the hunger games that's their dream future so max price says hi alex loved the channel
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:35.880]  from the uk i was wondering if the brexit doesn't happen is that the death of britain it's close to
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:42.280]  it look scotland was going to leave it should have left it has the whole north sea area it's
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:47.320]  being screwed over it's paying way past this fair share but they scared all the old pensioners
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:52.200]  they trained folks not to have kids so all these old scott scott's are dead scott's are gone unless
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:58.840]  everyone's are macadam over here but scotland they're dead and great people and they just
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:04.520]  capitulated through mass mind control and didn't go with the polls and i think probably did vote to
[02:44:04.520 --> 02:44:12.520]  stay it they're trying now with england and with ireland scottland in general and they're saying
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:18.360]  we'll leave you we'll shut you off financially if you try to leave the eu bureaucracy makes almost
[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:25.000]  all the laws the parliament is ceremonial they admit that and if the uk doesn't leave this
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.240]  they've been conquered what military force couldn't do they has been done economically
[02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:39.320]  because an invisible enemy that's more coded is is is hard to counter but yeah england if the
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:47.560]  brexit the british exit fails that is a that is a big failure for humanity but i would
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:56.040]  amounts i would imagine it's a fraud because it amounts to the ignoring of some of the big polls
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:04.040]  that show more than 10 percent ahead for an exit out of the dictatorial eu uh virtual gorilla says
[02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:09.880]  hi alex i love what you and info wars do can we see the barrett 50 cal joke okay well it's locked
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:14.360]  up in the safe right now actually both of them um what are your thoughts on obama's speech today
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:20.360]  and specifically what he said about the use of the words radical islam i saw the clip earlier
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:24.920]  he came out and made a joke about it well what does it do to say radical islam you admit that
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:31.560]  islam itself is radical has been taken over by radicals and is absolutely antithetical to everything
[02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:37.720]  you claim you push so sit here and lecture american men how we're sexist homophobes we're not doing
[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:43.080]  anything but submitting to you while you hang out at madrasa's and your speeches all over the world
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:49.400]  badmouthing the west and promoting islam what you promote is an authoritarian cult and so i think
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:53.800]  it shows his weakness that someone like donald trump would actually call him out on it well and
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:59.480]  also too i'd like to point out how you know for instance if a right wing christian whatever
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:05.240]  shoots up an abortion clinic it's always like religious you know fanatic religious extremism
[02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:10.520]  right when he ties it in christian but this and isis and all that he refuses to say it because
[02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:17.800]  it's a perversion of islam it has nothing to do with religion islam never had slaves islam had
[02:46:17.800 --> 02:46:24.760]  made biscuits and gravy when they say they're doing it for a lie like hello it's just uh what a joke
[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:30.520]  let's go to mohammed craps directly in obama's mouth every day oh there you go
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:36.200]  mexican says alex do you really think that the fight against the world elite is a winnable battle
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:39.960]  do you ever get tired or feel discouraged when it seems that there are a hundred thousand of them
[02:46:39.960 --> 02:46:46.760]  for every one of us yes i get discouraged sometimes but overall three percent won the
[02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:51.320]  revolution war against the british tyrants we're like thirty forty percent of a race color creed
[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:58.760]  and we have buckley hamlin and leon the absolute wonder woman over there to defeat the enemy what
[02:46:58.760 --> 02:47:03.640]  do you think leon i get discouraged a lot and i do but then i'm finally getting to that point
[02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:07.400]  you've said this to me for almost three years now but i'm finally getting to the point where i'm able
[02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:12.360]  to channel that into like anger and wanting to do something about it rather than letting it like
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:16.920]  defeat me and feel like you know we're losing because it's just so funny to see how we can
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:22.760]  talk about something and then the next day it shifts the whole narrative or we shut down
[02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:27.000]  what the mainstream media is trying to put out there and we're just tuning into the narrative of
[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:31.240]  reality in common since the people are already thinking we're just a focal point to magnify
[02:47:31.240 --> 02:47:35.000]  that but you see the effect we're having it's important it's pretty awesome i think we're
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:39.560]  turned on the tide overall buckley what do you think well here's a comment from trend thesis 12a
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:44.040]  that says i just have to say i only recently decided to listen to your show quite a surprise to
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:48.680]  found out find out you're not the crazy kook many try to portray you as just speaking the truth keep
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:54.680]  it up thank you trendist we appreciate that uh vinas magnus says thank you for doing this a ma alex
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:58.760]  what are your plans for the republican democrat and democratic national conventions this summer
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:04.120]  will there be an infil war's presence also i heard earliest this week that the gope cucks
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.680]  are still looking into their options vis-a-vis stopping trump becoming the nominee have you
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:13.000]  heard about this is it possible even though he already has more than 300 elegance then he needs
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:18.440]  to win we're breaking the conditioning yes the republicans are so arrogant that they're openly
[02:48:18.440 --> 02:48:22.840]  saying they may still try to steal the nomination which just shows her delusion but hillary did it
[02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:27.480]  with bernie even though he really won so that's kind of an example we're going to have reporters
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:37.880]  myself included at the rnc and the dnc this year in july so get ready for that uh jimmy darko says
[02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:42.760]  mr jones what kind of european is myself due to fight against social justice warrior culture
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:47.000]  our social justice warriors aren't as outspoken and up front as the american ones but that makes
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:53.480]  them all the more dangerous well europeans you know have been through a much big war so they
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:57.800]  want to just get along with folks and be nice but i just think it's important to realize that
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.360]  european culture is european culture and it's under attack by the elites because it's threatening
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:09.880]  to their command and control system so any type of culture you can promote this individual i don't
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:14.920]  care what culture it is worldwide does it feed into the corporate narrative that's why it's important
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:20.920]  to promote it so i just think being yourself is the key and not feeling impelled to follow the
[02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:28.120]  directives given to us by the mainstream media is that simple be your own man diana june man
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:33.000]  warring says do you believe that hillary will ever be held accountable for all she has done
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.560]  will it take a trump presidency to give her the justice that is due and i'm adding this or will
[02:49:37.560 --> 02:49:42.120]  obama pardon her unconditional that's why i think he finally backed her that's where it's going yeah
[02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:47.160]  no they they're failing forward she's in so much trouble she's got to get full power to
[02:49:47.160 --> 02:49:53.480]  protect herself right uh and look if hillary gets elected this this broadcast is going to
[02:49:53.480 --> 02:49:59.400]  you know get a lot bigger but i don't want to just have her elected so we can preside over the
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:05.880]  funeral pyre of the united states in the world she's very dangerous i have concerns about trump
[02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:11.560]  too but with hillary it's like 50 times worse i mean we know this is an evil evil entity we know
[02:50:11.560 --> 02:50:17.480]  what we're doing trump's an unknown country hillary is known and we know the establishment
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:21.480]  that's been screwing us over hate trumps that's why we're supporting him though we're doing it very
[02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:28.280]  carefully and and and and very watchfully with hillary uh i just cringe at what she'll do when
[02:50:28.280 --> 02:50:39.720]  she's in full power
[02:50:58.840 --> 02:51:04.280]  we use mobile devices right against our bodies every day but growing scientific evidence is

[02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:23.720]  like working with richard link letter i really liked your role in waking life rick link letter
[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:29.640]  called me in like a 1999 he said i'm making this movie called waking life i'd like you to be a part
[02:54:29.640 --> 02:54:33.640]  of it and then he just set it up and wrote a scope let me drive around for 10 minutes shot it they
[02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:39.000]  used one cut put the movie uh i hung out with him you know many times in this house playing baseball
[02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:46.280]  and basketball he's got a big place out in bass drop like 20 minutes behind me and uh we're told
[02:54:46.280 --> 02:54:50.600]  that we are the single most active sub on all of reddit at the moment well that's exciting isn't
[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:54.920]  it i think trump's even having a speech tonight isn't here was that another no he's having a
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:01.000]  speech tonight yeah so to even be that's awesome yeah we got hands on trump his giant pumpkin
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:06.120]  head that you like to find himself so we can do it but but i'm a pumpkin head too we can't
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:11.240]  measure our heads who has a bigger pumpkin head mere trump who is uglier mere trump who cares
[02:55:11.240 --> 02:55:19.000]  but but but getting serious um link letter is a classical liberal but he's so
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.400]  impacted intimidated by other fake liberals that basically i haven't talked to link letter
[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:30.280]  in like five years and he's a big listener he's a big supporter of the show he's a guy that exposed
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:35.480]  911 truth he's a guy that got a lot of big hollywood actors introduced him when i was doing
[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:39.400]  had a lot of great connections for me so i think link letter is a class act a great guy
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:44.440]  and i've been in two of his films i've consulted on some other films uh but when i came out against
[02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:50.200]  machete that was white house fun to create racial division that's when they basically cut all ties
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:54.760]  with me which is wonderful because i've been offered all these big hollywood films in hollywood
[02:55:54.760 --> 02:56:00.680]  i've been offered like major supporting roles in big movies that came out i've been offered like
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:05.560]  a million dollars for a role uh that sounds like a lot folks it's not when you're at this level
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:08.840]  because i had to find this whole operation i've been paid eight hundred thousand dollars in a year
[02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:14.280]  once for just a voiceover i did but uh most people would like bend over backwards being hollywood
[02:56:14.280 --> 02:56:19.240]  i actually one of the finest things that i see was like a something i own is the fact that i don't
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:24.680]  even respond to emails about big movies now i just piss on them and and like i'm i'm serious one of my
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:29.560]  finest enjoyment says all these roles i've just turned down and they've almost stopped doing it
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:34.200]  and the roles got bigger and bigger and i just said you know what i don't want your hollywood
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:40.440]  roles not not from a link letter but i mean pissing on hollywood is a luxury i got to be honest with
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:46.280]  you so okay kyle says who are some celebrities that you know are awake but won't go public
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:53.640]  you mentioned dav girl once is he a secret info warrior uh yeah there's i mean basically most people
[02:56:53.640 --> 02:56:57.240]  in hollywood are libertarians they don't want to be conservative they don't want to be liberal they
[02:56:57.240 --> 02:57:07.720]  just if it's like uh we saw one of the biggest you know stars of 80s cinema kurt russell come out
[02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:13.800]  and say i'm not liberal i'm not conservative i'm 1776 i'm americana i know he's a listener i know that
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:22.280]  you know so many other big top stars art listeners obviously of info wars because we're one of the
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.520]  only alternative ideas out there not even that good it's just everybody else is following this
[02:57:26.520 --> 02:57:33.320]  cookie cutter situation bruce willis uh brad pit was a listener like 10 years ago uh just you name
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:37.560]  it i mean i've been at these parties with a lot of these people and they're all just scared to death
[02:57:37.560 --> 02:57:42.840]  that's why it's so good to see a kurt russell or somebody else come out and say you know i'm against
[02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:46.520]  the new world order i'm against what's happening because they realize they're challenging that whole
[02:57:46.520 --> 02:57:51.480]  hollywood mafia i mean i've had some redstone call up now he's basically seen all and gone
[02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:56.520]  and threatened people that have come on my show i i mean i talked to mark cuban in a conference
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:58:00.920]  called and he said yeah i was going to put this movie on a thousand screens i'm getting white house
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:06.280]  threats of prison and then you're like okay well you're ducking out of the project a year later
[02:58:06.280 --> 02:58:11.080]  to the new york times he publishes the emails where the bush administration says if you expose

[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:41.000]  communities while never addressing the root of the cause well obama's doubled unemployment i mean
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:45.480]  on his watch for black americans african americans because they want to keep them dependent they don't
[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:49.960]  ever want to get out of that so absolutely their whole program is make us dependent obama went
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:54.680]  to africa and said you can't have air conditioning or cars i mean this is about austerity these are
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:59.800]  selling us to end innovation the elite have gotten enough innovation they're done they're gonna live
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:03.640]  forever merged with machines they think so why should you have innovation that's my answer we
[03:03:03.640 --> 03:03:08.920]  am well i agree i think also to the gay community can kind of see now it's like they take all these
[03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:13.640]  little minority groups and you're like their pet project until they don't need you anymore and so
[03:03:13.640 --> 03:03:19.640]  they support you only to the extent that they can convince to get more government power in order
[03:03:19.640 --> 03:03:25.320]  to help you exactly instead we need individual freedom whether you're white black hispanic
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:31.800]  asian easter bunny purple polka dotted everybody has these freedoms period and then it doesn't
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:36.520]  matter because individuals have that freedom but government wants us all boxed up in little groups
[03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:41.160]  they claim they're catering to well it's easier to control a large group of people who are all
[03:03:41.160 --> 03:03:45.160]  thinking the same and acting the same and will do whatever you tell them it's harder to control
[03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:48.840]  exactly where you have little minders that tell them the new languages right we're not

[03:08:35.400 --> 03:08:43.240]  broadcasting world wide it's alex john welcome back to the alex john show i'm david night your
[03:08:43.240 --> 03:08:48.840]  host on this tuesday june 21st 2016 our fourth hour we're going to be going to some of the
[03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:54.200]  callers that alex did not get to in the uh earlier part of the show we're going to talk to them in
[03:08:54.200 --> 03:09:00.360]  the next segment before we do just notice this article that was on drudge report of course
[03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:06.040]  we have it upon info wars as well secret service says a raging hillary clinton through a bible at
[03:09:06.040 --> 03:09:13.240]  a colleague now you know i guess we could call her a bitter flinger because we've heard barack
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:19.000]  obama talk about all those bitter clingers who cling to their guns and their bibles it doesn't
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:23.800]  have a problem with those who cling to their guns their bombs and the corons does he no it's just
[03:09:23.800 --> 03:09:29.320]  the people who have guns and bibles that they're concerned about but of course i think it all boils
[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:35.400]  down to temperament doesn't it we see that when we had these four gun control measures defeated
[03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:42.440]  yesterday in the senate she had a one word response enough that's what hillary clinton said enough
[03:09:43.240 --> 03:09:49.560]  and what does she mean by that enough she mean enough of the democratic process i'm going to do it
[03:09:49.560 --> 03:09:54.760]  as a dictator with executive orders when i become president i don't i don't really care what your
[03:09:54.760 --> 03:09:59.000]  elected representatives say i don't really care about the constitution enough for the democratic
[03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:04.040]  process enough for the constitution i'm going to do it myself so i think that's her temperament
[03:10:04.040 --> 03:10:11.240]  quite frankly and of course she threw this at a secret service agents head that's the most amazing
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:18.600]  thing about this i think is all the abuse the abuse that she flings and hurls at those who are
[03:10:18.600 --> 03:10:24.920]  risking their lives to protect her that's the arrogance the self-centeredness of this woman
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:29.960]  of these people and power it's just absolutely amazing to me and they say being assigned to
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:35.960]  hillary clinton's detail was quote a form of punishment handed down by passive aggressive
[03:10:35.960 --> 03:10:40.520]  middle management it's kind of like hogan's heroes you know where uh if you screw up you're
[03:10:40.520 --> 03:10:44.360]  going to get sent to the russian front well you know with hillary clinton you you know
[03:10:44.360 --> 03:10:49.560]  with a secret service you screw up you're going to get sent to hillary clinton's security detail
[03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:56.280]  you don't want that okay she's gonna he's going to come out to you with everything and the interesting
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:11:01.400]  thing is too we got a report today from the washington post chris zilla pointing out that hillary
[03:11:01.400 --> 03:11:10.680]  clinton has set a new record 200 days 200 days since she last held a press conference last time
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:17.160]  she held a press conference not a single vote had been cast in the presidential primaries that's
[03:11:17.160 --> 03:11:22.120]  how long it's been that's the arrogance the insularity of this woman the unaccountability
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:25.880]  of this woman she's had enough enough for the democratic process of course we've heard this
[03:11:25.880 --> 03:11:30.360]  many times from barack obama you know these guys they just can't get the answer that i want
[03:11:31.160 --> 03:11:34.920]  yeah i want them to do this and they don't do it so i'm going to do an executive order i'm
[03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:40.040]  just going to do an in-round the congress i don't really care about your elected representative
[03:11:40.040 --> 03:11:46.120]  you elected me as dictator as dictator in chief so i'm going to do whatever i wish now the senate
[03:11:46.120 --> 03:11:53.320]  has rejected for gun control measures and this is all centering around these so-called watch lists
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:12:00.200]  and understand a couple of things number one it's fine if we want to investigate somebody
[03:12:00.200 --> 03:12:03.880]  and put somebody on a terror watch list and say well we're going to secretly
[03:12:03.880 --> 03:12:10.040]  investigate this person and of course the fbi has said we don't want you to block their gun
[03:12:10.040 --> 03:12:14.200]  purchases necessarily because we're investigating them and we don't want them to know that they're
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:19.160]  being investigated well if they got a legitimate reason to investigate somebody some degree that's
[03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:25.320]  okay but the biggest problem with this is the fact that they are now assessing penalties
[03:12:25.320 --> 03:12:33.400]  based on you being on this secret watch list so now this is punishment now this is going beyond
[03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:39.720]  the constitution this is taking away our sixth amendment to due process and of course we already
[03:12:39.720 --> 03:12:45.880]  have that don't we we already have a no fly list so they put you on this secret list
[03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:53.080]  and then on the basis of you being on this list you are now judged to be a risk to society
[03:12:53.080 --> 03:13:00.600]  as if you had had due process as if you had had a public trial as if you had been able to confront
[03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:05.480]  your accusers as if you had been able to call witnesses in your defense as if you had been
[03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:12.520]  able to have a real public trial and they assessed penalties on you but before any of that has happened
[03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:19.240]  and so we have this pre-crime situation here and they want to extend it now to something else why
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:25.080]  because we tolerated this with the no fly list just as we now have this supreme court decision
[03:13:25.080 --> 03:13:30.520]  coming out and I agree I found myself agreeing with Sotomayor I'm absolutely amazed but she was
[03:13:30.520 --> 03:13:35.640]  absolutely right but in the minority and the supreme court they had a five three majority
[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:43.320]  opinion that said that illegal stops are fine and we can arrest people we don't we can use
[03:13:43.320 --> 03:13:48.280]  things that we find in an illegal stop where we don't have probable cause where we don't have a
[03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:53.560]  search warrant we can use all that stuff to come after somebody and she said by legitimizing
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:14:00.120]  conduct that produces a double consciousness this case tells everyone white black guilty innocent
[03:14:00.120 --> 03:14:04.440]  that an officer can verify your legal status at any time it says your body is subject to
[03:14:04.440 --> 03:14:09.320]  invasion while courts excuse a violation of your rights it implies you are not a citizen of a
[03:14:09.320 --> 03:14:17.960]  democracy but the subject of a carceral state just waiting to be cataloged you see gun owners
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:26.040]  need to understand this that we cannot allow all of our civil liberties to be taken the
[03:14:26.040 --> 03:14:33.160]  bill of rights either stands together or we will lose all of our rights remember beginning of the
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:41.400]  republic we will hang together or we will hang separately the pictures that showed the 13 colonies
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:48.760]  like a snake that was chopped up they said join or die stand together or you're going to die and
[03:14:48.760 --> 03:14:56.600]  that is true of our individual liberties as well the bill of rights and the constitution stands
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:15:02.760]  collectively together or we lose everything the gun owners lose their rights other people lose
[03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:10.120]  their civil liberties if the gun owners won't stand against the encroachment on our civil liberties
[03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:15.240]  in the name of the war on drugs then don't expect to keep your second amendment either
[03:15:15.240 --> 03:15:18.360]  you're going to lose your first amendment you're going to lose your second amendment you're going
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:24.280]  to lose all of them you either get all of these the constitution is taken as a whole the bill
[03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:29.880]  of rights taken as a whole these are principles about individual liberty they're guarantees
[03:15:29.880 --> 03:15:36.680]  of our individual liberty that we're given to us that we possess as individuals as human beings
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:42.920]  as children of god okay there are natural rights if we allow you to take them in one area then
[03:15:42.920 --> 03:15:48.280]  they're going to go everywhere we need to understand that left and right and so we need to stand against
[03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:53.640]  all these infringements we can't allow them to piecemeal take our freedoms like they do with
[03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:58.200]  the airport for example when she starts to talk about this and of course the situation is they
[03:15:58.200 --> 03:16:02.520]  were surveilling a house they saw a guy come out of the house they didn't have a warrant for him
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:09.080]  they detained him they said they found an outstanding arrest warrant for traffic violation then they
[03:16:09.080 --> 03:16:13.640]  searched further they find some drugs and then they arrest him now the utah supreme court said no
[03:16:13.640 --> 03:16:19.000]  they didn't have probable cause and yet an opinion written by clearance thomas who normally i agree
[03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:24.760]  with okay he takes a very authoritarian approach he says all the evidence suggests that the stop
[03:16:24.760 --> 03:16:29.560]  was an isolated instance of negligence on the part of the police that occurred in connection
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:34.200]  with a bona fide investigation of a suspected drug house well i would say if it's an isolated
[03:16:34.200 --> 03:16:39.800]  instance of neglect then why would the supreme court look at this the supreme court doesn't
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:45.240]  look at isolated incidents the supreme court looks at something that has broad implications
[03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:52.840]  so that is doublespeak at the very beginning but then sotomayor said this she says do not be
[03:16:52.840 --> 03:16:58.040]  soothed by the opinions technical language this case allows the police to stop you on the street
[03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:02.760]  to demand your identification to check it for outstanding traffic warrants even if you're doing
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:08.040]  nothing wrong oh we know that is happening that's happening everywhere it's going to happen even more
[03:17:08.040 --> 03:17:15.640]  extensively and it happens at the airport i have to prove my innocence says if i'm a criminal
[03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:21.720]  to these people before i can travel at the airport and it's the travel security or safety or whatever
[03:17:21.720 --> 03:17:26.840]  they are the tsa i don't even know or care what they call themselves they're unconstitutional
[03:17:26.840 --> 03:17:32.520]  they are an affront to the fourth amendment the tsa and these airport security procedures
[03:17:33.160 --> 03:17:38.440]  must go for this same reason she goes on to say being stopped on the street is more than
[03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:43.640]  just a small indignity so is it at the airport so is it at the airport she said the officer
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:49.240]  can search a citizen's bag oh really okay that happened pretty much every time i go to any public
[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:55.160]  event anymore uh order him or her to stand helpless perhaps even conduct a frisk this
[03:17:55.160 --> 03:18:01.080]  involves more than just a pat down is on looker's pass by she says the officer may feel within feel
[03:18:01.080 --> 03:18:05.240]  with sensitive fingers every portion of your body a thorough search may be made of your
[03:18:05.240 --> 03:18:10.040]  arms and armpits your waistline your back your groin an area of the testicles entire surface
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:18.040]  of the legs down to the feet okay yeah that happens every day in airports when are we going
[03:18:18.040 --> 03:18:23.880]  to realize that so we stand together or we hang separately and our liberties stand together
[03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:29.880]  or they hang separately now after they lost these gun control measures obama comes out
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:36.520]  and says uh well we're still going to have gun reform gun reform they call it gun control
[03:18:36.520 --> 03:18:41.480]  he's calling it gun reform he says being tough on terrorism means making it harder for people to
[03:18:41.480 --> 03:18:47.000]  get their hands on assault weapons no getting tough on terrorism means that you don't bring them in
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:52.280]  imam obama you don't bring the terrorists into this country you don't stand down our defenses
[03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:57.960]  against vetting and checking people who are coming into this country that's getting tough on terrorism
[03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:05.400]  getting tough on terrorism means getting tough on the terrorists not focusing on one simple tool
[03:19:05.400 --> 03:19:12.360]  and it's not the most devastating tool they can use but we still have a push forward on the assault
[03:19:12.360 --> 03:19:17.560]  weapons ban not only do we have fox news pushing on it with all these different anchors we've got
[03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:22.920]  gretta carlsson pushing for an assault weapon ban we got bill o'reilly pushing for an assault
[03:19:22.920 --> 03:19:27.960]  weapon ban you know because it's one of these things like uh nuclear weapons you know an assault
[03:19:27.960 --> 03:19:31.720]  weapon it's dangerous i mean you're gonna let people have nuclear weapons and bombs and hand
[03:19:31.720 --> 03:19:36.280]  grenades no you can't have that so an assault weapon is like that says bill o'reilly as he's
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:41.560]  talking to donald trump and now we've got states new york and connecticut have enacted assault
[03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:50.840]  weapons ban and the supreme court as it's been changed with the new majority they refuse to
[03:19:50.840 --> 03:19:55.240]  hear those cases allowing those to stand stay with us we'll be right back with your calls

[03:25:31.080 --> 03:25:37.160]  earlier about the trump assassination attempt go ahead hey how's it going david doing good
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:45.000]  well my point was is uh i i honestly don't think that they're going to try to assassinate trump
[03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:48.840]  and the reason that i think that they're not going to do it is because it's too obvious
[03:25:49.800 --> 03:25:54.840]  if they if they were to do something like that or you know you would be in some sort of accident
[03:25:54.840 --> 03:26:01.240]  or you know you name it any possibility the finger will immediately be pointed at these
[03:26:01.240 --> 03:26:06.600]  these different groups and organizations and the different people who have come out and basically
[03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:12.040]  just uh you know supported it you know in mainstream media on the internet and everywhere
[03:26:12.920 --> 03:26:19.080]  and uh the media just kind of pushes it in hopes that maybe somebody hears it and gets
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:26.280]  inspired by it and actually does something or cover or maybe that's even a cover and they do
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:30.680]  plan to do something i don't know but i think it would be obvious but we've had other assassination
[03:26:30.680 --> 03:26:36.680]  attempts in the past that were obvious as well you know look at jfk and did that keep them from
[03:26:36.680 --> 03:26:42.600]  doing it look at the situation in the uk and the brexit poll do you do you think that that was
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:48.520]  something that was orchestrated by people who want to see brexit lose or was that just lucky
[03:26:48.520 --> 03:26:53.800]  for them that that happened exactly one week before the election there you think they would kill
[03:26:53.800 --> 03:26:58.120]  one of their own in order to uh i mean that's a little less obvious isn't it even though they've
[03:26:58.120 --> 03:27:03.560]  used that uh that that card in the past we saw the same thing happen and we had an article
[03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:09.400]  a couple days ago on info wars dot com martin armstrong that's an article from zero head she
[03:27:09.400 --> 03:27:16.920]  pointed out that a similar thing happened back in 2003 there was a lady anna lend she was a swedish
[03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:22.760]  social democrat politician she is being groomed for leadership positions there she was the voice
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:29.240]  in favor of sweden joining the euro and just as she was going to a debate that night she was
[03:27:29.240 --> 03:27:34.200]  attacked with a knife in a department store and killed similar situation what happened to this
[03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:40.040]  young lady certainly uh i don't think that when you've got trillions of dollars at stake here
[03:27:40.040 --> 03:27:44.760]  for these multinational corporations the power that is at stake for these governments i don't
[03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:49.640]  think that there's anything that these people would not do including uh using one of their own
[03:27:49.640 --> 03:27:55.160]  as a sacrificial lamb to get sympathy for their cause to demonize the other side and that's precisely
[03:27:55.160 --> 03:28:00.680]  what we've seen happen for the last week and is going to happen right up to the vote they're going
[03:28:00.680 --> 03:28:07.320]  to be having uh playing this uh prejudice card this this uh they've they've flagged the brexit
[03:28:07.320 --> 03:28:11.880]  people as being a campaign of hate so they've used it to tar the entire movement what do you think
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:19.720]  about that i i don't think anything off the table and i'm i'm certain that that was orchestrated
[03:28:19.720 --> 03:28:24.920]  they they pulled that off the time you everything it was too perfect and then you and you see you see
[03:28:24.920 --> 03:28:30.920]  the polls drop and the whole the whole thing was set up in the beginning it they were they were set
[03:28:30.920 --> 03:28:38.200]  up to fail yeah we even see uh newspapers they're saying mp dead after attack by brexit gunman
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:44.520]  they just they come out in the newspaper that's the headlines a brexit gunman killed her i mean
[03:28:44.520 --> 03:28:51.160]  this guy was you know he could barely tie his own shoes all of his neighbors said right he was a
[03:28:51.160 --> 03:28:56.440]  gardener he didn't know anything that was going on but we're supposed to believe that this guy
[03:28:56.440 --> 03:29:02.040]  immediately again the usual suspects the southern poverty law center and some white supremacist
[03:29:02.040 --> 03:29:08.680]  groups both come out and say hell yeah he got stuff from us uh back in 1999 so it's that 17

[03:29:15.960 --> 03:29:22.040]  folks uh it's very easy for them to to uh take you off of those meds to uh switch those things
[03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:27.480]  out program you whatever i mean this guy supposedly for 17 years who can't tie his own shoes and
[03:29:27.480 --> 03:29:32.760]  carry on a conversation he made his own gun and then he sat on it for 17 years until the time
[03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:38.600]  was right to do this i mean none of this none of this makes any sense i mean i i smell rat big

[03:35:04.520 --> 03:35:14.360]  donald trump go ahead go ahead pam hello with you hey how you all right good to hear me david
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:20.200]  i got you go ahead yeah i've been waiting to talk to you i love your reporting oh thank you and uh
[03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:27.960]  i think you're kind of the the anchor for alex as far as you know to keep him even kill you're
[03:35:27.960 --> 03:35:35.560]  wonderful um my parents like you too i want to say um just saying with the uh fascination with
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:44.680]  trump um i think we need to kind of quail that and my big question is uh with all the movies that
[03:35:44.680 --> 03:35:52.120]  are coming out about uh 12 years of slave which is something to ruffle the feathers of racial
[03:35:52.120 --> 03:35:57.720]  tension in the country oh yeah um they they're talking about coming out with a brand new roots
[03:35:58.600 --> 03:36:02.600]  series oh they're gonna do that they're not just talking about it it's gonna be yeah it's gonna
[03:36:02.600 --> 03:36:08.680]  happen yeah go ahead and i was wondering because i remember saying that when i was younger and that
[03:36:08.680 --> 03:36:15.480]  created tension between the blacks and the whites it made me feel bad yeah i remember walking around
[03:36:15.480 --> 03:36:21.560]  feeling bad and it was something that had nothing to do with me did you did you free your slaves pam
[03:36:22.680 --> 03:36:28.040]  i watched ten 12 years of slave and my mom said she couldn't watch it it was so graphic yeah and i
[03:36:28.040 --> 03:36:34.840]  told her i said oh you would not believe what a racial uh tension kind of a movie that was because
[03:36:34.840 --> 03:36:41.160]  i said there's so many uh blacks that are going to watch that and it's going to stir those emotions
[03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:50.600]  in them and in my main question okay coming to this uh no matter who gets elected as president
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:57.480]  or whether or not the election is actually held up because uh there could high probability be
[03:36:57.480 --> 03:37:06.040]  uh uh racial tensions that break out there could be more terrorist plots that come to surface and
[03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:14.280]  you could actually have uh racial uh divisions that maybe might call for martial law oh yeah
[03:37:14.280 --> 03:37:18.440]  okay that's the whole point that's why they want to create these divisions is so that they can have
[03:37:18.440 --> 03:37:25.080]  an excuse to call for martial law that's why we had 9 11 so they can have the so-called patriot act
[03:37:25.080 --> 03:37:31.720]  yeah absolutely i'm sorry go ahead see where obama you know i can see him very easily saying well
[03:37:31.720 --> 03:37:37.080]  to be identified you must come get your chip you know i mean i i predict this out of this guy
[03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:44.600]  but what about uh what about mr trump has anybody put the question to him uh in time of a civil
[03:37:44.600 --> 03:37:51.960]  emergency what would his plan be yeah i haven't heard anybody uh ask him that and uh that's one
[03:37:51.960 --> 03:37:57.160]  of the things that i'm concerned about with donald trump is his understanding to and commitment to uh
[03:37:58.120 --> 03:38:04.440]  civil liberties um and the bill writes i mean clearly there is a choice in this election
[03:38:04.440 --> 03:38:12.200]  number one we know that the establishment is all out for the the tools that are going to give them
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:16.600]  the next step to global governance and that's the trade treaties that they call them but of course
[03:38:16.600 --> 03:38:21.320]  they're about sovereignty just as we see what's happening in the european union with brexit
[03:38:21.320 --> 03:38:26.040]  we understand that that's about sovereignty and i've got an interesting uh article here from
[03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:32.120]  the washington post that really puts it in those uh those issues they always talk about the economics
[03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:36.520]  of it but it's really about the political sovereignty and of course these trade agreements
[03:38:36.520 --> 03:38:41.480]  are about internet freedom they're about our sovereignty and clearly you know somebody controls
[03:38:41.480 --> 03:38:47.080]  your economy uh that's a great deal of sovereignty that you've uh seated right there but it goes
[03:38:47.080 --> 03:38:52.040]  beyond that so they always talk about those issues and and so when we're looking at donald trump
[03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:57.400]  there's a good reason to vote for donald trump because there is an existential question as to
[03:38:57.400 --> 03:39:02.920]  whether or not we're going to continue to exist as a country that's the question before britain
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:06.680]  in the next couple of days are they going to continue to exist as a country or are they going
[03:39:06.680 --> 03:39:12.120]  to quietly fade away and that's the question before us with the election of donald trump with
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:18.200]  all of these candidates who are coming back against this consolidation into a global governance so
[03:39:18.200 --> 03:39:23.800]  that's a very important reason to vote for him nevertheless on the other side i am very concerned
[03:39:23.800 --> 03:39:28.280]  about his understanding of civil liberties and his commitment to those things and so yeah that could
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:35.000]  be a very uh that that could be an issue with him as well certainly we see how easy it has been for
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:39.960]  people like bill riley to railroad him on this issue of the terror watch list you know he doesn't want
[03:39:39.960 --> 03:39:45.560]  to sound as if he is supporting terrorists and you're not a terrorist because they put you on
[03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:51.560]  a watch list you're not a terrorist because they put you on a no fly list you're a terrorist if and
[03:39:51.560 --> 03:39:59.720]  when you are convicted by a jury in a public trial with due process that's when you're a terrorist
[03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:04.920]  that's when you punish people on that basis until that point you should not be punishing people
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:09.960]  before you give them due process i mean that's the kind of pre-crime world that we're heading
[03:40:09.960 --> 03:40:14.040]  into so yeah that does give me cause for concern but you know pam when you're talking about this
[03:40:14.040 --> 03:40:18.440]  you're talking about the different ways that they want to pit one group against the other
[03:40:19.320 --> 03:40:23.560]  these these programs that are coming up i ask you you know did you get rid of your slaves pam
[03:40:26.520 --> 03:40:31.880]  i've not been a slave i don't think i've been a slave i've worked hard and i've not ever slaved
[03:40:31.880 --> 03:40:37.960]  anybody i've usually had to end up doing it my own self well you know you do it yourself right
[03:40:37.960 --> 03:40:42.200]  and of course that's a rhetorical question there aren't any white people in the united states
[03:40:42.200 --> 03:40:48.120]  that are living even whose grandparents are probably great grandparents had slaves okay
[03:40:48.120 --> 03:40:53.000]  i would say maybe i don't know going depending on how old you are maybe your great grandparents
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:58.120]  had slaves or whatever but you haven't had any slaves for generations but there are people
[03:40:58.120 --> 03:41:03.800]  in the islamic world that still have slaves you know we have more slavery now in the world than
[03:41:03.800 --> 03:41:09.080]  we did at the time of the civil war we were not the only country to have slaves and when we get
[03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:16.840]  this turn this into a black versus white issue we ignore the fact that's that the islamic and the
[03:41:16.840 --> 03:41:22.840]  arab states had a great deal to do with the slave trade they were the ones who captured people out
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:29.320]  of africa and when we were looking at this situation with Muhammad Ali when he died and
[03:41:29.320 --> 03:41:36.200]  everybody was eulogizing him there was a lady from Somalia who had emigrated to the west and she
[03:41:36.200 --> 03:41:43.800]  said i could not believe that this man would take the name of people who had and were conducting
[03:41:43.800 --> 03:41:48.520]  slavery she said at the time he changed his name from Cassius clay to Muhammad Ali
[03:41:48.520 --> 03:41:56.280]  there were slaves and still are in Saudi Arabia and he got rid of the name Cassius clay do you
[03:41:56.280 --> 03:42:01.960]  know who Cassius clay was do you know who the original Cassius clay was you know Pam
[03:42:03.240 --> 03:42:07.400]  you know i i didn't know until this came up and a couple of people mentioned it i went back and
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:13.480]  looked at the history of this guy this was a guy in Kentucky he was an abolitionist in Kentucky
[03:42:13.480 --> 03:42:18.680]  and it was a hot issue because there were people in Kentucky who wanted to keep people as slaves
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:25.000]  but Cassius clay became an abolitionist and his family had had slaves and he rejected that and
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:32.760]  he fought against that and he set up a newspaper and he was shot in the chest by a guy who was pro
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:37.560]  slavery and he pulled out his buoy knife and stuck the guy and you know threw him in a ditch
[03:42:37.560 --> 03:42:42.920]  and then he set up his newspaper and he was attacked at the newspaper so he got a cannon
[03:42:42.920 --> 03:42:48.360]  and put it in his printing press room to fight off people and armed it set it up as an arsenal to
[03:42:48.360 --> 03:42:54.520]  defend the second amendment to defend his first amendment and eventually he had a group of 60
[03:42:54.520 --> 03:43:01.160]  people overtake that printing press and burn it to the ground that didn't stop Cassius clay he
[03:43:01.160 --> 03:43:07.880]  continued to fight as a newspaper guy he moved his printing press to a neighboring state where he
[03:43:07.880 --> 03:43:12.680]  could do that and still continue to publish although he had the printing presses elsewhere and still
[03:43:12.680 --> 03:43:18.840]  brought the information in and out of ignorance and see that's the thing Muhammad Ali Cassius clay
[03:43:19.400 --> 03:43:26.040]  was ignorant about history he didn't know which what was his left hand which was his right hand
[03:43:26.040 --> 03:43:29.960]  he didn't know the people who were against him and he didn't know the people were for him so he
[03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:35.400]  got rid of this name Cassius clay because he said that's a slaver's name no it was the name of a
[03:43:35.400 --> 03:43:41.400]  guy who risk his life who put everything on the line to stop slavery and then Muhammad Ali took
[03:43:41.400 --> 03:43:48.840]  the name of people who were keeping slaves at the time that's the sad thing about not knowing our
[03:43:48.840 --> 03:43:56.280]  history about not knowing our politics that is the consequence of ignorance and today I just took
[03:43:56.280 --> 03:44:01.960]  a look at my twitter feed I saw a twitter feed up there about RT and they got some guy at RT
[03:44:01.960 --> 03:44:06.520]  talking about how it's time to get rid of the second amendment and saying we never had an
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:11.320]  individual right to keep an own arms until the supreme court invented it in 2008 with a heller
[03:44:11.320 --> 03:44:16.840]  DC case that's a total lie anybody that knows what's going on in history we've seen the same
[03:44:16.840 --> 03:44:22.360]  thing from Gretchen Carlson at Fox News telling people you don't have a right to own assault
[03:44:22.360 --> 03:44:27.880]  weapons we need to ban these things and we didn't even have guns weren't even invented when the
[03:44:27.880 --> 03:44:33.640]  constitutional was written I mean that kind of profound ignorance exhibited by Gretchen Carlson
[03:44:33.640 --> 03:44:39.960]  exhibited by Muhammad Ali is what costs us our birthright of freedom we can't allow that to happen
[03:44:39.960 --> 03:44:45.160]  that's why this is an information war people need to understand what our freedoms are based on they
[03:44:45.160 --> 03:44:49.640]  need to understand what our history is and so you're absolutely right these efforts that
[03:44:49.640 --> 03:44:55.080]  they're pulling out 12 years as a slave the the reinvention of roots which from what they're saying
[03:44:55.080 --> 03:45:01.640]  is going to be far harsher far more polarizing than the original one was and that's by design
[03:45:01.640 --> 03:45:06.200]  and of course they went to the White House to talk about how it was going to be coming out
[03:45:06.200 --> 03:45:13.400]  this is by design this is designed to create racial tension to create hatred to make people
[03:45:13.400 --> 03:45:19.080]  hate you even though you've never owned slaves even though you may have had ancestors who fought
[03:45:19.080 --> 03:45:25.720]  to free slaves even though you reject it totally they want to hold you personally responsible
[03:45:25.720 --> 03:45:30.280]  they want to start a civil war that's what this is all about thank you so much Pam I need to move
[03:45:30.280 --> 03:45:39.160]  on to Scott in California Scott go ahead hello Scott do we have Scott
[03:45:41.720 --> 03:45:47.480]  hey Scott hey yeah hey thank you for taking my call sorry I know you've been holding a long time go
[03:45:47.480 --> 03:45:53.800]  ahead that's okay well that last caller kind of stole my thunder um I kind of had a comment on the
[03:45:53.800 --> 03:46:00.840]  same same lines you know it's my opinion that I think Obama was set up to be martyred because I
[03:46:00.840 --> 03:46:06.040]  believe that the subversive leftists really believe that this country is so racist that they would
[03:46:06.040 --> 03:46:12.760]  have taken out the first black you know candidate and since that didn't happen you know they're
[03:46:12.760 --> 03:46:18.200]  looking for other ways and I think that they they feel that Trump has such a following and and they
[03:46:18.200 --> 03:46:25.240]  feel that the his followers are so such fanatics that they would probably uh you know make that
[03:46:25.240 --> 03:46:30.840]  happen if they took him out well it's interesting you know all the stuff that we see and and as we
[03:46:30.840 --> 03:46:36.920]  see uh I've seen a lot of uh liberal commentators say look you know uh what do you expect from people
[03:46:36.920 --> 03:46:41.880]  I mean certainly this is justified Donald Trump went to Chicago and held a rally there
[03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:47.400]  what nerve to go to Chicago and hold a rally I mean certainly you can't have free speech in
[03:46:47.400 --> 03:46:52.280]  Chicago right and anybody that doesn't hold the majority opinion they have a right to be
[03:46:52.280 --> 03:46:57.400]  beaten in the streets because you know this is bill airstown I mean I can't believe the logic
[03:46:57.400 --> 03:47:01.640]  that I hear from the left people saying well because he rejects political correctness because
[03:47:01.640 --> 03:47:07.240]  he says it to their face I'm not going to be uh confined by your uh you know your politically
[03:47:07.240 --> 03:47:12.280]  correct terms I'm not going to play by your terminology they always like to play the terminology
[03:47:12.280 --> 03:47:17.240]  game and because he says I'm not going to abide by that uh it's triggered you know they're triggered
[03:47:17.240 --> 03:47:23.640]  by this and so that makes him a racist and it really does uh make a uh a small minority of them
[03:47:23.640 --> 03:47:28.040]  violently angry and so they say well that's his fault I would say no I would say that it's the
[03:47:28.040 --> 03:47:34.760]  fault of the people who have programmed them that way to become violently uh reactive when
[03:47:34.760 --> 03:47:43.000]  their prejudices are triggered can I uh can I can I make another point sure um in my opinion uh
[03:47:43.000 --> 03:47:48.360]  you know there's all this fervor about the trope uh you know not liking Mexicans and all that stuff
[03:47:49.320 --> 03:47:55.000]  I wonder if what would happen if he turned the tables on them and said listen I love Mexico
[03:47:55.000 --> 03:48:01.000]  you love Mexico there's a reason why people are fleeing Mexico to come here why don't we
[03:48:01.000 --> 03:48:09.240]  we work with these groups the the la raza and mezza and say listen let's take the revolution
[03:48:09.240 --> 03:48:14.520]  to Mexico let's change Mexico's policies and their politics so the people that love their
[03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:19.800]  country can stay there and be prosperous in their own land no absolutely well we don't
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:23.560]  want to do that in Mexico we don't want to do that in Syria and we don't want to do that in
[03:48:23.560 --> 03:48:29.880]  the Middle East because that's not the point so the point is they want to replace the indigenous
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:35.720]  paul uh the populations and the culture and the legal system throughout the west throughout the
[03:48:35.720 --> 03:48:41.720]  us throughout western europe they want to replace it with a different population that is more amenable
[03:48:41.720 --> 03:48:48.360]  to their authoritarian uh regime that sees themselves as benefactors of the government
[03:48:48.360 --> 03:48:55.640]  that is unquestionably loyal to them because that government brought them in and brought them into a
[03:48:55.640 --> 03:49:00.280]  land of milk and honey that's why they're doing this it isn't that they want to help these people
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:05.560]  they could easily help these people in their own countries and of course first thing they could do
[03:49:05.560 --> 03:49:12.440]  to help mexico is to stop the war on drugs and they've had tens of thousands of people die
[03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:19.000]  from the war on drugs in mexico and that is our own doing the war that's going on in syria is
[03:49:19.000 --> 03:49:23.640]  something that we started the actual war that's going on in syria so we create the unrest in
[03:49:23.640 --> 03:49:28.920]  these countries and now we're no longer using that as an excuse to invade those countries
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:33.880]  or to change their form of government instead we use it as an excuse to invade our own country
[03:49:33.880 --> 03:49:39.160]  and to change our own form of government and that's clearly what's going on here you have to
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:45.880]  understand this is about fundamentally changing america about balkanizing united states about
[03:49:45.880 --> 03:49:52.040]  creating a new compliant dependent population and uh that that's why they're bringing them here
[03:49:52.040 --> 03:49:55.960]  they could easily there's a lot of things that they could do because we are one of the biggest
[03:49:55.960 --> 03:50:00.360]  irritants in both of those areas there's a lot of things that we could do to make life better there
[03:50:00.360 --> 03:50:05.000]  so the people didn't come here but we don't want that that's what our government doesn't want they
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:08.920]  want to bring the people here to create a problem was there anything else that you wanted to say
[03:50:08.920 --> 03:50:15.480]  scott before we move on uh just that's uh what part of shall not be in friends to people not
[03:50:15.480 --> 03:50:21.960]  understand exactly exactly and we have to understand that uh i agree with you we have to understand
[03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:28.120]  that shall not be infringed should apply to all of the bill of rights we either keep all of our
[03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:34.120]  individual liberties they all hang together uh or we lose everything if we don't that's a complete
[03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:42.920]  set and if you think that you can sell off your freedom for security for prosperity for comfort
[03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:49.320]  you are a fool you have the mindset of a slave you're going to get more than 12 years as a slave
[03:50:49.320 --> 03:50:53.880]  you're going to get generations of slavery if you sell out the bill of rights stay with us we'll be

[03:55:03.560 --> 03:55:10.600]  starter to say the least take your phone with you when you wear your hillary for prison t-shirts
[03:55:10.600 --> 03:55:14.440]  but i think it is enough i think we have had enough of hillary i think it's time for hillary
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:19.720]  to go to prison not the white house but the big house now let's take a look at this gun control
[03:55:19.720 --> 03:55:25.400]  measure okay because it's not all bad news i mean we've got some good news the senate and gridlock
[03:55:26.360 --> 03:55:29.560]  decided that they weren't going to try to override our constitutional rights and the
[03:55:29.560 --> 03:55:35.320]  second amendment and infringe upon them but then we also have some states we have new york and
[03:55:35.320 --> 03:55:40.520]  connecticut that have enacted their own assault weapon bands and i don't know even know how they
[03:55:40.520 --> 03:55:47.000]  define an assault weapon that's a vague term i guess it's anything that scares an anti-gun liberal
[03:55:47.000 --> 03:55:51.640]  is considered to be assault and so any weapon that scares an anti-gun liberal i guess would
[03:55:51.640 --> 03:55:56.680]  be an assault weapon i guess i don't know nevertheless they have enacted some state bands
[03:55:57.320 --> 03:56:01.560]  and the supreme court said it is going to allow those to stand and again that is
[03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:06.760]  because of the new supreme court without scalia gun owners america however pointed out this is
[03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:13.560]  from uh wnd they pointed out in a public message intended for congress that in a poll of 15 000
[03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:19.160]  law enforcement officers they said by a two to one margin law enforcement officers in this country
[03:56:19.160 --> 03:56:25.640]  favor arming civilians as a better response to crime than expanding background checks a whopping
[03:56:25.640 --> 03:56:33.800]  91 percent of the respondents favored armed civilians carrying firearms that's 15 000 law
[03:56:33.800 --> 03:56:38.920]  enforcement officers i mean when you have these presidential surveys understand they get a margin
[03:56:38.920 --> 03:56:43.560]  of error of about four or five percent that include that they talk to like four or five hundred people
[03:56:44.120 --> 03:56:48.760]  and then they get that margin of error down a little bit if they talk to more people okay
[03:56:48.760 --> 03:56:55.400]  this is 15 000 law enforcement officers now what do they know they know that it takes them a while
[03:56:55.400 --> 03:57:01.880]  to get to a shooting or an incident that they can get there to file a report but it's very rare
[03:57:01.880 --> 03:57:06.440]  that they can be there when this is happening you need to be able to protect yourself you need
[03:57:06.440 --> 03:57:12.120]  to be able to protect other people that's why they support it and they may not know it but
[03:57:12.120 --> 03:57:16.600]  i imagine some of them know what has happened in venezuela remember venezuela this bankrupt
[03:57:16.600 --> 03:57:22.680]  socialist country that spent 47 million dollars four years ago to set up gun control a gun confiscation
[03:57:22.680 --> 03:57:27.240]  centers they've taken the guns from the people in venezuela because they knew the country was
[03:57:27.240 --> 03:57:35.080]  going down the tubes and what happened you've now got police officers in venezuela being hunted down
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:40.040]  and killed on the streets for their weapons some of them don't have weapons when they're off duty
[03:57:40.040 --> 03:57:44.200]  but they kill them anyway because hey you know maybe they got a weapon maybe they don't you
[03:57:44.200 --> 03:57:49.000]  know we'll just go ahead and get them so yeah that's right that's the way it's going to happen
[03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:53.000]  for the police in this country they don't want to be the only ones with weapons because then
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:59.800]  they've got a big target put on their back and yet we see at the same time uber has now banned
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:05.720]  all their drivers from carrying guns why because it was an uber driver in chicago who pulled out
[03:58:05.720 --> 03:58:11.160]  his pistol when a guy started shooting into a crowd and he shot the guy and stopped the attack so
[03:58:11.160 --> 03:58:17.960]  uber's response was we're going to ban all uber drivers from having guns yet another reason
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:24.600]  not to use that globalist crony capitalist country's service companies services if you needed
[03:58:24.600 --> 03:58:38.840]  another one join us tonight 7 central 8 p.m. eastern for the nightly news
