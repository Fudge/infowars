[00:00.000 --> 00:11.080]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.080 --> 00:18.600]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin
[00:18.600 --> 00:37.520]  texas alex jones ladies and gentlemen here we are the 30th day of
[00:37.520 --> 00:46.160]  december 2013 and this year is not long in the tooth the teeth of this year are
[00:46.160 --> 00:52.240]  falling out and this year has a very long white beard soon the new year will
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.240]  come in and I talked a lot in the last few weeks especially yesterday on the
[00:56.240 --> 01:01.000]  sunday transmission about what a critical year 2014 is and I want to settle
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.640]  down a little bit today because I was pretty wound up yesterday I didn't get
[01:03.640 --> 01:09.000]  to everything I wanted to cover I wanted to try to settle down a little bit and
[01:09.000 --> 01:15.080]  really go over with the listeners why I think 2014 is such a critical year and
[01:15.080 --> 01:20.920]  also get your take on that and the callers were just so good yesterday
[01:20.920 --> 01:23.640]  because we don't screen calls we get some great calls we get some callers
[01:23.640 --> 01:26.760]  that sound like they've been drinking a gallon of cough syrup and they're
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.880]  calling us with two tin cans and a string but we have great listeners bottom
[01:30.880 --> 01:34.840]  line and just the callers yesterday really got me thinking and made so many
[01:34.840 --> 01:38.640]  great points what do you think the biggest story not the biggest media
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.840]  story not all the fake hype stories the fluff stories the distraction stories
[01:42.840 --> 01:49.200]  you know the Dallas Cowboys losing to the Eagles or whatever the big issue here
[01:49.200 --> 01:55.320]  is what are the real stories of 2013 and I think the larger awakening and the
[01:55.320 --> 02:04.760]  implosion of the confidence in the system I think undoubtedly that is the
[02:04.760 --> 02:10.200]  overarching big story of 2013 that the awakening not just here but worldwide
[02:10.200 --> 02:16.240]  is on and then the Snowden revelations and NSA and all the tyranny coming out
[02:16.240 --> 02:21.600]  and then Benghazi gate and IRS gate and harassment of the media and persecution
[02:21.600 --> 02:26.160]  of the Tea Party it all rolls into that one of the biggest stories of course is
[02:26.160 --> 02:29.760]  the fact they tried to expand the open war against Syria public said we're
[02:29.760 --> 02:33.000]  backing al Qaeda against people that didn't attack anybody this is outrageous
[02:33.000 --> 02:39.800]  so that's a huge story but I want your take on what you really think overall is
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.840]  the most important stories of 2013 2013 is also been the year where the
[02:45.840 --> 02:48.800]  establishment openly circled the wagons and said look we're just gonna
[02:48.800 --> 02:53.240]  outright lie to the public now we're gonna engage in even more psychological
[02:53.240 --> 02:58.400]  warfare race baiting sexual baiting every form of
[02:58.400 --> 03:04.280]  vulcanization you can imagine the media has gone completely openly nakedly
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.520]  weaponized in 2013 and then let's look forward though because it's a double
[03:09.520 --> 03:14.160]  double deal I want to know what you think about 2013 and then any other issues
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.000]  you want to mention after you give us your take on that and then what's what's
[03:18.000 --> 03:24.320]  coming in 2014 and do you agree with myself and countless others like Rand
[03:24.320 --> 03:31.560]  Paul Ron Paul Matt drudge Joseph Farah basically everybody we talk to her
[03:31.560 --> 03:35.480]  everybody we read everybody who's been accurate in the past has their ear to
[03:35.480 --> 03:39.360]  the ground knows what's going on says this is such a critical year not just
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.880]  with the midterm elections trying to repeal some of what Obama's done and
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.760]  then actually bring him to justice but but geopolitically with Russia moving
[03:49.760 --> 03:56.640]  missiles up to their Western borders with the West with Western Europe and
[03:56.640 --> 04:01.040]  just all of this is such a big deal and we're gonna be breaking all that down
[04:01.040 --> 04:04.200]  after I hit some of the news coming up in the next segment I'm gonna open the
[04:04.200 --> 04:07.680]  phones up not now but in about 10 minutes I'll give the number out so that we
[04:07.680 --> 04:10.920]  can get your take on all this there's a lot of news obviously that I haven't
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.600]  gotten to yet because we're four minutes into transmission but the bombings in
[04:17.600 --> 04:21.840]  Russia follows Saudi threat to attack Russia and again this could be a false
[04:21.840 --> 04:27.240]  flag Russia has engaged in what looks like false flags before when Putin was
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.600]  running for his first election from vice president to president there were
[04:31.600 --> 04:37.320]  some events but this this follows direct Saudi threats to lose Russia tens of
[04:37.320 --> 04:41.600]  billions of dollars trying to discredit them and and not let them have the
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.760]  international spotlight during the winter Olympics coming up and so my gut
[04:45.760 --> 04:50.000]  and and all different angles here and the way this is happening is this is
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.760]  meant to destabilize Russia make Putin look weak and it looks like the CIA with
[04:54.760 --> 04:59.120]  Saudi Arabia activated their al-Qaeda forces
[04:59.120 --> 05:04.840]  introducing pro one all of your filtration in one system portable on the

[09:16.200 --> 09:23.320]  and I reach out through the airwaves I reach out to you via radio and of course
[09:23.320 --> 09:34.680]  television on this Monday the 30th day already of December 2013 and obviously
[09:34.680 --> 09:39.880]  we have masses of incredibly important news but I want to open the phones up
[09:39.880 --> 09:43.920]  right out of the gates to ask you what do you think the most important not the
[09:43.920 --> 09:51.000]  biggest fluff stories but what were the most important stories of 2013 I believe
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.040]  it is the huge awakening that is now accelerating and then all the big
[09:55.040 --> 09:59.840]  breaking stories and developments come out of that awakening the public woke
[09:59.840 --> 10:06.320]  up and the military led the way speaking out and literally told Obama no we
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.160]  will not attack Syria with aircraft and know the special forces will not train
[10:11.160 --> 10:25.880]  al-Qaeda in bases in Iraq in Jordan and in Turkey that is that is huge that that
[10:25.880 --> 10:31.240]  Dempsey who was a lapdog of the establishment went to Obama at the
[10:31.240 --> 10:35.000]  White House on a Friday night they were going to hit him on Saturday and said
[10:35.000 --> 10:41.240]  the military is not with us we cannot do this the whole world is really upset
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.440]  about what's happening and the French were the only ones freaking out running
[10:45.440 --> 10:48.800]  around saying attack attack attack
[10:48.800 --> 10:56.040]  what does that tell you well the French are set to get part of the pipelines
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.800]  they're going to come out of there with a natural gas in the oil the French want
[11:00.800 --> 11:08.280]  America to fund al-Qaeda to take over that area and our country is finally
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.040]  having that moment of conscience where we look at something and just say is
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.840]  there nothing we won't go along with is there nothing we won't do just by saying
[11:16.840 --> 11:21.240]  we're the good guys so it's okay when the country's been hijacked is being
[11:21.240 --> 11:29.280]  captained by the most anti-human anti-liberty combines nameless faceless
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.120]  corporate boards who can all rationalize what they're doing and insulate
[11:34.120 --> 11:38.400]  themselves from the decision that their minions are carrying out well we're
[11:38.400 --> 11:41.920]  going to name those nameless faceless globalist and point out their power
[11:41.920 --> 11:45.200]  structure because when the Federal Reserve is known to be private and known
[11:45.200 --> 11:49.520]  to be owned by less than 20 families predominantly out of Europe and England
[11:49.520 --> 11:54.440]  when it's known that the country's being run by foreign combines when it's known
[11:54.440 --> 11:57.600]  they're gearing up for war domestically against the people and that it's
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.480]  treason when it's known that what they're doing is the author of our
[12:02.480 --> 12:08.440]  discontent when it's known that they are the plague culturally when it's known
[12:08.440 --> 12:12.640]  the globalists want us poor and dumb down so they can run our lives when it's
[12:12.640 --> 12:16.360]  known that there's a shadow government people didn't know believe there was a
[12:16.360 --> 12:19.800]  shadow government just three years ago the majority of media would make fun of
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.640]  me now when the LA Times or the New York Times or the Washington Post is
[12:24.640 --> 12:28.360]  interviewing me they say well why are you against the shadow government why
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.720]  are you against a corporate world government oh I thought it didn't
[12:31.720 --> 12:38.680]  exist bozos but see we are winning the info war so now you can't deny stuff
[12:38.680 --> 12:43.320]  exist to your readers you've got to admit it but say oh we're rabble rousers
[12:43.320 --> 12:48.880]  we're extremist because we don't like the global system oh what are you against
[12:48.880 --> 12:55.680]  peace and harmony in a world system that brings us together this is not a
[12:55.680 --> 13:02.480]  world system to bring us together this is a globalist ring of power a
[13:02.480 --> 13:08.040]  centralized technological world government that scientifically targets
[13:08.040 --> 13:13.280]  humanity in a giant experiment a social experiment of deconstruction of
[13:13.280 --> 13:19.880]  leveling competition for a genetic corporate rewrite of the entire skin of
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.560]  the planet not just homo sapiens sapien
[13:25.480 --> 13:31.760]  homo sapien extinctus they would be a good name for it or the homo sapiens are
[13:31.760 --> 13:37.600]  dead the homo sapiens are gone because a bunch of unhappy nihilistic globalists
[13:37.600 --> 13:46.080]  who have unlimited sex power private jets everything hundreds of trillions of
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.960]  dollars and euros that they've stolen and created their own alternate
[13:49.960 --> 13:54.360]  fraudulent stock market system a bubble meant to absorb the rest of the world
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.920]  and impoverish the world while only empowering a select few and then
[13:58.920 --> 14:05.680]  blaming free market capitalism for your abomination that is a fraudulent
[14:05.680 --> 14:12.600]  computer code hacking the very nature of reality and turning the public into a
[14:12.600 --> 14:20.600]  bunch of drooling screen time zombies that's what we're talking about in 2013
[14:20.600 --> 14:25.440]  the fight against that the awakening to that listen they deny FEMA camps the
[14:25.440 --> 14:30.760]  emergency centers establishment act the civilian inmate labor camp program they
[14:30.760 --> 14:34.800]  have to deny stuff that's public because if they ever admit it then there is a
[14:34.800 --> 14:38.600]  debate about it and they can't win that debate that's why they say there's no
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.480]  drones in the skies there's no billions of bullets there's no checkpoints on
[14:42.480 --> 14:46.880]  the highway it's not tyranny to have kids being trained to spy on their parents
[14:46.880 --> 14:50.280]  it's not tyranny to arrest kids that play with Nerf guns in their backyard it's
[14:50.280 --> 14:54.960]  not tyranny that if a kid has a gun showed on their sweater that they you
[14:54.960 --> 14:58.920]  know the TSA doesn't let them fly or if a kid's wearing an NRA shirt doesn't
[14:58.920 --> 15:01.840]  even have an image of a gun on it they're kicked out of school it's not
[15:01.840 --> 15:08.400]  tyranny no you're right it's not tyranny it's crazy town tyranny
[15:11.320 --> 15:19.800]  and they are just running around like zombies with their heads cut off
[15:19.800 --> 15:24.400]  wanting us to buy into their whole fraudulent system wanting us to buy
[15:24.400 --> 15:31.760]  into their lives and it's not happening anymore if we get the word out that
[15:31.760 --> 15:38.680]  this society is falling this society is imploding and point out that it is
[15:38.680 --> 15:43.160]  being scientifically orchestrated in the establishments own words it's game over
[15:43.160 --> 15:47.040]  and I know I've said that many times in different ways but I want people to
[15:47.040 --> 15:51.960]  really get that through their melons the establishment wouldn't be trying to
[15:51.960 --> 15:57.520]  censor real talk radio the establishment wouldn't be trying to shut down free
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.440]  speech and wouldn't be trying to tell us resistance is futile if resistance
[16:01.440 --> 16:07.160]  was futile the truth is there's always been a very tiny group that loves
[16:07.160 --> 16:12.160]  liberty in a very tiny group that loves darkness and most people are just
[16:12.160 --> 16:17.400]  lackadaisical and kind of followers and want to be told what to do but the
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.600]  minority that burns with liberty burns with the animating contest burns with
[16:22.600 --> 16:28.160]  visions of humanity empowered to the greatest level those of us that burn
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.720]  with admiration for the beautiful and the intelligent and the successful and
[16:32.720 --> 16:37.880]  the pure and the virtuous those that do not have the envy or the jealousy or the
[16:37.880 --> 16:44.800]  hatred of the good we are a large minority compared to the tiny minority
[16:44.800 --> 16:50.360]  of those that absolutely serve evil and look at globalism look at the ten
[16:50.360 --> 16:56.160]  kingdoms under FEMA in the United States and then globally ten regions under the
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.640]  UN and UNESCO and the OECD which is the real global corporation that runs
[17:01.640 --> 17:08.520]  everything that was set up after World War two OECD organization of economic
[17:08.520 --> 17:14.120]  cooperative development they create the plan and their board it is then voted on
[17:14.120 --> 17:17.280]  and there's any disputes they meet at groups like Bilderberg and trial
[17:17.280 --> 17:21.360]  lateral Commission to for fine-tuning this is all on record they all write
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.440]  books admitting it bragging how they run everything hoping you don't go read it
[17:25.440 --> 17:28.720]  though it's only for their own minions to be able to read it when Carol
[17:28.720 --> 17:33.560]  quickly wrote his 1100 page tragedy and hope in the early 1960s there was only
[17:33.560 --> 17:37.480]  to be a thousand of them copied for academia and it was to be given to the
[17:37.480 --> 17:43.640]  CIA the State Department but also to other heads of state around the world
[17:43.640 --> 17:50.640]  but the plates got out and a few copies got bought and pieces of it got
[17:50.640 --> 17:56.280]  republished in magazines and lawsuits were threatened by the publisher but it
[17:56.280 --> 18:02.360]  was fair use and so the word got out on tragedy and hope and then later just by
[18:02.360 --> 18:09.800]  sheer brinkmanship patriot groups have republished it we sell it and my point
[18:09.800 --> 18:14.800]  in bringing that up is he says in the book we have to have an operation
[18:14.800 --> 18:18.800]  manual because this is so sophisticated our own people have to understand it how
[18:18.800 --> 18:22.880]  we control left how we control right how we want the illusion of choice how
[18:22.880 --> 18:26.280]  we're going to destroy markets destroy freedom impoverished people create a
[18:26.280 --> 18:30.640]  technocracy brzezinski's written five books on the same subject admitting at
[18:30.640 --> 18:37.760]  all how the US government funded a poll pot to kill 31% of their population
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.720]  all you've got to do is have the courage to realize we've been hijacked and have
[18:44.720 --> 18:47.840]  the courage to tell others because here's the deal the courage is only on
[18:47.840 --> 18:54.000]  the surface and by that a lot of people think to fight this is dangerous if you
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.920]  actually knew and it actually studied this if you're a new listener the
[18:57.920 --> 19:02.000]  danger isn't going along with this and literally losing your independence your
[19:02.000 --> 19:07.360]  individualism your soul and that's what the globalist traffic in is the souls
[19:07.360 --> 19:11.120]  of men as the Bible says that's what they're really after they want our
[19:11.120 --> 19:15.720]  souls they want to know who we are so they can program us and change us that's
[19:15.720 --> 19:20.520]  the ultimate control freak vision and once you realize that it is not courage
[19:20.520 --> 19:25.240]  to fight this if men were coming to kill my family and were coming to kill me it
[19:25.240 --> 19:29.800]  would not be courage that I would fight them with every bit of vicious cunning
[19:29.800 --> 19:39.720]  that I possess that is not courage that is survival if you corner a raccoon in
[19:39.720 --> 19:42.440]  your garage and try to kill it it's gonna attack you viciously biting and
[19:42.440 --> 19:47.720]  snapping like a PCP driven machine and not because it has courage it wants to
[19:47.720 --> 19:53.440]  live 800 to 5 of 9 92 31 I want to hear what you think the biggest stories of
[19:53.440 --> 19:57.800]  2013 are and what's coming up in 2014 do you agree with me it's a critical year
[19:57.800 --> 20:03.000]  800 come back with a member the facts are in the studies are legion sodium

[20:11.600 --> 20:16.640]  engineers adding it to the water simple dumb down the host population that the

[24:17.160 --> 24:30.880]  my turn
[24:47.160 --> 24:56.360]  This is the end of 2013. Starting at the beginning of the next segment, I'm going directly to your
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.920]  calls and then at the beginning of the next hour I will cover the top stories and get into
[25:02.920 --> 25:09.720]  some of the breaking news as well. You have the Volgrad bombings following Saudi Arabian threat
[25:09.720 --> 25:16.440]  to attack Russia to destabilize the country and discredit the Olympics and now there have been
[25:16.440 --> 25:25.480]  other bombings inside Russia, not just the bombing in Volgrad and these are reportedly by Black Widow
[25:26.040 --> 25:32.840]  female suicide bombers connected to the Western run Al Qaeda and this is an open secret outside
[25:32.840 --> 25:40.680]  of the United States just as Al Qaeda has been used against the more stable pro-west pro-liberty
[25:40.680 --> 25:51.720]  groups in Libya and in places like Egypt and you're like wow pro-west in Libya yes very pro-west
[25:51.720 --> 25:58.040]  in the last 10 years for about seven years before they killed Qaddafi seven and a half years he was
[25:58.040 --> 26:02.120]  investing in the West letting everybody in from Halliburton to you name it building hotels everywhere
[26:02.120 --> 26:08.680]  and apologizing for everything and allowing investment and I mean look we're doing business
[26:08.680 --> 26:15.560]  with Vietnam right now we lost 58,000 people and 200 plus thousand seriously wounded
[26:18.040 --> 26:23.080]  and Qaddafi probably wasn't even behind the the Lockerbie bombing that was a double false flag
[26:23.080 --> 26:30.440]  but that's another story the point here is as we know Egypt was an ally and was not persecuting
[26:30.440 --> 26:36.840]  Christians and other large minority groups in Egypt now they are and then it got so out of control
[26:36.840 --> 26:41.640]  16 million people marched Muslim Brotherhood took over with a million person marched 16
[26:41.640 --> 26:45.800]  million marched and they had street battles and defeated them and so the Muslim Brotherhood
[26:45.800 --> 26:51.240]  started blowing up facilities all over Egypt and attacking military bases so the military
[26:51.240 --> 26:57.320]  crushed them and I'm not romanticizing the Egyptian military but I'll take them over Al Qaeda Al
[26:57.320 --> 27:04.760]  CIA to any day and and again the CIA large elements of it let's be clear a lot of folks in the CIA
[27:04.760 --> 27:10.600]  are going public saying they don't like this have created Al Qaeda protected Al Qaeda and
[27:10.600 --> 27:17.080]  fostered it because British intelligence in 1903 made a deal with a Bedouin leader who controlled
[27:17.080 --> 27:22.600]  a small area of what is Saudi Arabia today a couple hundred square miles and they gave them
[27:22.600 --> 27:27.720]  weapons and they took over what is Saudi Arabia today and they took over other countries like
[27:27.720 --> 27:36.280]  Syria that they had no claim on and by 1933 dominated more than half the Middle East
[27:38.120 --> 27:45.320]  so in fact it was more than half probably 80 percent or so the point is is that this is the
[27:45.320 --> 27:51.640]  type of garbage that we see going on and people are like well later you saying there aren't Muslim
[27:51.640 --> 28:01.080]  extremists no I'm saying there's a giant pool of crazies in Saudi Arabia and they go and have set
[28:01.080 --> 28:09.240]  up base camps funded by the CIA on record all over southern Russia and all over Europe and all over
[28:09.240 --> 28:15.000]  the United States and the globalists give one order one phone call one message to Saudi Arabia
[28:15.000 --> 28:21.720]  intelligence and our Bush as he's known Prince Bandar Sultan Bandar who's set to probably end up being
[28:21.720 --> 28:27.080]  the leader of the country down the road he's the head of intelligence now and they activate
[28:28.280 --> 28:33.560]  one cell that gives the orders and ladies and gentlemen Al Qaeda sleeper cells all over the
[28:33.560 --> 28:42.600]  western world will engage in havoc that makes 9-11 look like a blessing as horrible as it was
[28:42.600 --> 28:50.920]  and the system will then use those attacks to fully have martial law and shut down the free
[28:50.920 --> 28:55.240]  press and go after all the opposition to the structure and it won't matter if we're like hey
[28:55.240 --> 29:00.120]  the government's behind this shut up traitor Al Qaeda just killed you know 200,000 people
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.920]  dirty bombs planes flying into buildings trains being blown up I don't want to get into what you
[29:04.920 --> 29:09.720]  can do but well it's well known by these grips I'll just say you go up the top of a high rise
[29:09.720 --> 29:14.200]  building and you dump toxic chemicals into the ventilation staff to kill everybody I mean
[29:14.200 --> 29:20.840]  let me tell you a five-man team trained right in each city could kill 10,000 people like that
[29:20.840 --> 29:28.520]  10,000 people okay so the point is and that's a conservative number and I'm telling you that's
[29:28.520 --> 29:32.680]  the new world order secret weapon is they run Al Qaeda these offshore banks that run our country
[29:32.680 --> 29:39.720]  and in 2014 we better be ready for their false flags because they are hitting Russia right now
[29:39.720 --> 29:44.600]  another 30 dead we're gonna break that down after phone calls coming up and then a lot of news on
[29:44.600 --> 29:51.560]  Obamacare the stock market the mega bubbles all of it coming up we're on the march the empires on

[34:10.600 --> 34:17.720]  systems of propaganda media spotlight shifting to positive obama cares stories rabble rousers won't
[34:17.720 --> 34:23.720]  get attention and that's being announced all over the news the washington post and politico
[34:23.720 --> 34:30.920]  have been reporting that the media is going to follow orders from the white house and then
[34:30.920 --> 34:37.560]  become openly state run they've been state run for a while and only report on positive stuff
[34:37.560 --> 34:43.160]  and anyone who doesn't like it is a rabble rouser that's a new word like conspiracy theorist
[34:43.720 --> 34:48.600]  it's not a new word but it's a new use of the word that anyone that doesn't like getting double
[34:48.600 --> 34:53.560]  triple quadruple prices and having the quality of care cut and anyone who knows that republican
[34:53.560 --> 34:58.040]  leadership with democrats wrote the bill as a open world government corporate tax just like
[34:58.040 --> 35:04.040]  carbon taxes are this new health care taxes directly to the globalist supreme court ruled
[35:04.040 --> 35:09.080]  private tax to offshore corporations and if the public puts up with it they're going to do more
[35:10.600 --> 35:15.080]  and even if you revolt they plan on using that to destabilize things and bring in martial law
[35:15.720 --> 35:21.400]  and then if you start winning the battle if the states organize organize openly with the
[35:21.400 --> 35:26.040]  national guard that's been federalized then they'll try to send in special forces against them
[35:26.040 --> 35:33.080]  that's in the john warner defense authorization act of 2007 and then if the us military doesn't go
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.920]  along with the treason they'll activate al-qaeda or they'll claim al-qaeda nukes major cities and
[35:38.920 --> 35:44.360]  use that to get us quaking in fear we are held hostage you're like man that's a bold takeover
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.280]  uh yeah when hijackers take over a plane or bank robbers go in and put everybody in you know zip
[35:50.280 --> 35:56.760]  ties and start robbing the vault it's a big deal the globalists get off on this excitement they've
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.440]  got the money they've got the power they've got the 50 mistresses they've got the best doctors
[36:02.440 --> 36:07.320]  they've got the private jets they've got everything this is what they do for excitement this is why
[36:07.320 --> 36:13.960]  they're in control is because they're willing to go for it all and we sit here actually caring
[36:13.960 --> 36:25.400]  about a spurs basketball player who did a anti-nazi salute but the different political
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.160]  correct groups knowing what they're doing said don't do that that's racist apologize that offends
[36:31.160 --> 36:36.600]  jewish groups as if they speak for all the jews in the world so just saying any gesture
[36:36.600 --> 36:41.960]  anything we deem is bad we will label even if it isn't racist and you're not allowed to do it
[36:41.960 --> 36:47.000]  how about racist stuff is allowed because if you get rid of racist stuff they will then get
[36:47.000 --> 36:51.560]  rid of everything you understand that and that's how this works they've done it all over the world
[36:52.280 --> 36:58.600]  you can't sell or possess in france Nazi memorabilia even though you can go to a
[36:58.600 --> 37:07.080]  world war two museum and it's all fascinating u.s british german uh russian all of it japanese
[37:07.080 --> 37:17.160]  oh no oh no you're racist all of you are guilty but the very system that is proto-nazi the globalist
[37:17.160 --> 37:22.600]  and eugenics predate nazism the nazis just got too big for their britches and we're only selecting
[37:22.600 --> 37:28.120]  certain groups for extermination the globalist hyper eugenics movement goes after everyone
[37:28.120 --> 37:35.640]  except one tenth of one hundredth of one thousandth percent we're talking about i've done the math zero
[37:35.640 --> 37:41.640]  point zero zero zero zero zero zero two three i think it was if you've got six thousand super
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.760]  class in the world average six thousand into seven and a half billion people in the world
[37:46.760 --> 37:52.760]  and you get an amazing fraction all right i said i'd take your calls i want to take your calls
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.720]  we're going to cover so much coming up uh in the next hour
[38:00.760 --> 38:03.160]  so much to discuss so much to break down
[38:05.960 --> 38:10.520]  look at this state department whistleblowers email hacked messages deleted part of the
[38:10.520 --> 38:17.560]  ongoing cover-up that's just some of the news on that front egypt arrest alga zero tv crew for ties
[38:17.560 --> 38:23.400]  to muslim brotherhood and of course who runs alga zero british intelligence on record just like
[38:23.400 --> 38:28.600]  cnn is cia forage foundation carney endowment on record look it up that's even in the washington
[38:28.600 --> 38:37.480]  post itself cia enable intelligence connections cop gets two years free legal cavity searches ah
[38:38.680 --> 38:46.600]  isn't that interesting but see when the tsa does it it's supposedly okay beyond say is slammed for
[38:46.600 --> 38:54.200]  sampling challenge your shuttle tragedy i mean you should be able to sample whatever you want i
[38:54.200 --> 38:59.640]  should be able to make a music video about about tragedies if i wanted to and have uh radio
[38:59.640 --> 39:05.000]  transmissions about the hennanburg bursting into flame oh the humanity and then play clips about
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.760]  war if i wanted to but see it's all about everything's bad and no one has speech but the establishment
[39:10.760 --> 39:22.520]  and now chicago has worst pension crisis in the us i'm going to be getting to that from the financial
[39:22.520 --> 39:29.560]  times of london that's just some of the news and i'm looking at on drudge report dot com
[39:29.560 --> 39:35.720]  if you go over to info wars dot com chinese president orders pl a to prepare for war so now
[39:35.720 --> 39:43.160]  it's not just their top general their chairman of their joint chiefs a month ago now it's the president
[39:45.000 --> 39:48.360]  volgrad bombings follow saudi threat to attack russia already mentioned that
[39:49.400 --> 39:54.760]  volgrad trolley blast terror attacks hit southern city day after railway station bombing future
[39:54.760 --> 40:04.280]  trends of 2014 going under over a million lose unemployment benefits with the acceleration
[40:04.280 --> 40:10.760]  hitting a million by the end of next year an interesting article article anderson silva
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.840]  horrifying shin break most likely due to chronic vitamin d deficiency via dark skin
[40:18.840 --> 40:23.240]  that's very important for folks no one will tell you if you've got dark skin that you need
[40:23.800 --> 40:31.080]  more vitamin d and that you need more sun because you don't produce as much
[40:31.080 --> 40:38.200]  much vitamin d naturally because you come from areas that are closer to the equator so you obviously
[40:38.200 --> 40:42.360]  don't need to produce that much vitamin d or you'd get too much if you were out in the sun all day
[40:43.080 --> 40:51.640]  at the equator but if you don't live at the equator and don't get a lot of sun and you got
[40:51.640 --> 40:57.720]  dark skin man you are going to get cancer real quick that's why if you look at a cancer rates
[40:57.720 --> 41:03.160]  in the major studies are higher in blacks than any other group in industrialized nations in the
[41:03.160 --> 41:10.520]  north you go to africa it's quite low but the highest cancer rates are in the western northern
[41:10.520 --> 41:15.400]  world because of all the toxins and things but also from not getting enough sun period
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.480]  but then you expand that and you bring people from the equator up to the north i mean you're not
[41:21.480 --> 41:28.280]  designed to live in the north and if you don't get vitamin d you're going to die real fast
[41:28.280 --> 41:33.320]  but again no one's going to tell you that it's just 101 no one's going to tell you that
[41:35.160 --> 41:39.720]  i mean that's why blue eyes are more light sensitive and have better night vision on record
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.680]  because you're designed to live in the north where sometimes it's dark for three months no sun for
[41:44.680 --> 41:52.760]  three months that's what blue eyes are for and then you continue on i mean it's the same deal of a
[41:52.760 --> 41:59.480]  white guy went down to the middle of africa and didn't wear uh didn't wear clothing uh you get
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.560]  skin cancer real fast okay that's enough ladies and gentlemen let's go to your phone calls
[42:03.560 --> 42:08.280]  2013 what are the biggest stories the most important stories not just the biggest and 2014
[42:08.280 --> 42:12.200]  how key of a year is it i'm going to give you my breakdown at the bottom of the next hour but
[42:12.200 --> 42:17.400]  i want to get your take right now let's talk to frank in north carolina you're on the air go ahead
[42:17.960 --> 42:21.880]  hey alex thanks for taking my call uh i'm starting to get a humming on my
[42:21.880 --> 42:26.760]  line now i'm not here in line yeah i'm on a landline not on speakerphone but i agree with you
[42:26.760 --> 42:32.440]  i called into a show saturday i think the biggest story of 2013 is the overwhelming sentiment of the
[42:32.440 --> 42:37.800]  american people against war at least an open conflict with syria and that really kind of
[42:37.800 --> 42:45.160]  surprised me i think it's a good thing however i still do not see any signs of any grand awakening
[42:45.160 --> 42:52.040]  and uh i i i'd like to be uh uh just you know i'd like to be wrong i'd like to be proven wrong
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.400]  but i i don't see any grand awakening uh in 2014 i think there's a lot of uh dislike and
[42:57.400 --> 43:03.160]  distrust of obama and rightly so but i think a lot of it is just this boss uh you know left right
[43:03.160 --> 43:09.400]  control paradigm um i think a lot of people probably would have been been for war with syria if if
[43:09.400 --> 43:15.880]  we'd had a republican president such as a mit romney or something like that very interesting
[43:15.880 --> 43:25.080]  points uh what do you think's coming up in 2014 um more of the same um pretty much more of the same
[43:25.080 --> 43:29.800]  uh i think the establishment i think the talk radio host across america are going to continue
[43:29.800 --> 43:35.720]  to protect the criminal establishment i think they're going to do so more by silence you may
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.280]  have a few brave ones here and there putting you know putting out a few uh you know good warning
[43:41.400 --> 43:45.640]  informational shows or segments or whatnot but i i think people i think you're going to see a
[43:45.640 --> 43:49.960]  lot of people getting scared i think a lot of the information that's coming out my personal
[43:49.960 --> 43:54.840]  opinion is it's it's being leaked out to let you know that you're being watched uh i think a lot
[43:54.840 --> 43:59.240]  of it's for intimidation i agree that's what that's what dr pacinic said and i appreciate your call
[43:59.240 --> 44:04.440]  and i'm not saying and i've really thought about this now great points great caller i'm not saying
[44:04.440 --> 44:09.640]  snowden is a double agent a triple agent i'm not saying he's a bad guy my gut tells me he's real
[44:09.640 --> 44:15.400]  but they chose in the media to selectively dribble out only what they wanted to put out
[44:15.960 --> 44:22.200]  to try to inoculate people psychologically to accepting and to intimidate political free speech
[44:22.200 --> 44:28.200]  and to normalize the rollout right as the giant nsa total surveillance grids go online they want
[44:28.200 --> 44:33.240]  to start openly using it in court as i predicted now they admit they are they use illegally gathered
[44:33.240 --> 44:39.800]  data in court roiders has reported they create fake investigation cases so that they can then lie to
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.960]  the juries if it goes to jury trial now they're dispensing with that and just telling the jury
[44:43.960 --> 44:50.200]  we got this via you know abc the problem is is that you can then frame people that much easier
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.120]  uh so there's just a lot of problems with that but great points uh wane in arizona you're on the air
[44:56.120 --> 45:03.080]  go ahead hello alex i'm so glad to get a hold of you uh well i just i've been listening for about
[45:03.080 --> 45:09.560]  a little over a year maybe two and it's incredible how informative you are how informed you are you
[45:09.560 --> 45:17.400]  must really study uh my topic is uh the politicians the crooked politicians that are running this
[45:17.400 --> 45:24.920]  country and the agenda that they have you are so on because i i happen to grow up in carmel california
[45:24.920 --> 45:31.880]  and leon panetta used to give me rides to school in the morning and uh congressman by the name of
[45:31.880 --> 45:41.160]  sam afar is a family member of mine uh second third cousin however um he borrowed my dad's horse
[45:41.160 --> 45:47.560]  and saddle to run in his first election campaign to make himself look like a bold brave cowboy
[45:48.600 --> 45:54.760]  however he is not i i can't say anything too bad against him but i just don't think he's in our
[45:54.760 --> 45:58.520]  in our side of the court well i mean you don't get into the high level power now unless you
[45:58.520 --> 46:02.920]  play ball with the globalist and the problem is is they're playing ball with the devil so it only
[46:02.920 --> 46:07.480]  leads to doom and gloom on letting this power structure stay in power uh what do you think's
[46:07.480 --> 46:15.400]  coming up in 2014 i think i think lack of food for this country and there's just 50 million people
[46:15.400 --> 46:19.320]  that are on food stamps they want 100 million people that are going to be dependent on them
[46:19.320 --> 46:26.680]  so i can see it coming i've had trouble i had two bagels for Thanksgiving dinner this year wow
[46:28.040 --> 46:34.920]  and uh i i was i was ran out of phoenix arizona flyer commission on my job and i've been doing
[46:34.920 --> 46:41.160]  since i was 15 16 years old which was training race horses i was a jockey race horse rider all my
[46:41.160 --> 46:50.360]  life and they uh they crucified me um down there um that's a different subject but i realized that
[46:50.360 --> 46:55.800]  they're all the same the politicians in the in the city local state governments are all
[46:56.440 --> 47:01.400]  in kazoos i was about to say i mean i'm talking to builders i talked to restaurant owners small
[47:01.400 --> 47:07.640]  factory owners everywhere across the country the harassment is five ten times depending on where
[47:07.640 --> 47:14.680]  you live what it's ever been all the big corporations are lobbying for agenda 21 zoning and rules that
[47:14.680 --> 47:22.760]  cripple everybody but them and i have a friend who had a factory in phoenix uh employing hundreds of
[47:22.760 --> 47:28.760]  people and paying them good and the unions came and forced them to use union and then they just
[47:28.760 --> 47:33.240]  shut him down set up their own shop and and basically ran him out and and that's the same
[47:33.240 --> 47:38.760]  story that is just happening everywhere because why should these companies have to compete they
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.800]  can just come in and take over and i'm not saying unions are all bad they had a place 100 years ago
[47:43.800 --> 47:51.240]  50 years ago but now unions promote naft and gat now unions promote uh open borders that you know
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.800]  bring in workers to replace them it's just insane unions have become just a political
[47:55.800 --> 48:02.600]  arm now of the globalist i appreciate your call let's talk to richard in texas richard you're on
[48:02.600 --> 48:11.240]  the year go ahead the pleasure is online i'll be real quick about it now uh i saw a show about
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.360]  eight years ago i don't know if it was discovery channel or the history channel or the science
[48:16.360 --> 48:22.680]  channel but it was a show showing how they can break down radio active material and reduce
[48:22.680 --> 48:29.240]  the factors original elements on the periodic chart now i think that's the biggest uh conspiracy i
[48:29.240 --> 48:34.280]  think that covers that's a perennial conspiracy as far as i'm concerned because that's the killer
[48:34.280 --> 48:38.920]  that keeps on killing now you probably know more about that than me because you're well well they
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.960]  can use lasers and other systems and particle beams to change different radioactive isotopes
[48:43.960 --> 48:49.560]  the problem is is having the energy to be able to say go to fukushima and then process it all
[48:50.600 --> 48:57.880]  it's the energy it takes to uh to manipulate the particles i'm not a physicist but i've read about
[48:57.880 --> 49:02.760]  it but separately yes radiation levels are increasing all over the world but particularly
[49:02.760 --> 49:07.320]  in the northern hemisphere and it's a big issue and i do think i didn't think of that that is one
[49:07.320 --> 49:13.880]  of the big untold stories of 2013 is the radiation levels the deterioration of the cleanup uh becoming
[49:13.880 --> 49:19.000]  just a bigger disaster at fukushima uh i agree with you and then and then of course more and more
[49:19.000 --> 49:25.720]  is coming out about the automation of our world robot cars robot buildings smart grids spying on
[49:25.720 --> 49:31.240]  us humans being made obsolete that's the big trend going into 2014 is you're going to see
[49:32.600 --> 49:40.120]  a crystallization of that i agree now i was wondering if you could have a guest on
[49:40.120 --> 49:45.480]  an expert that wouldn't know about that because like the lady who showed who showed the formula
[49:45.480 --> 49:50.200]  she actually went to the drawing board like one minute left in the show she showed it was a simple
[49:50.840 --> 49:54.920]  formula of course i don't know the formula i'm not a mathematician but she said it was really
[49:54.920 --> 50:01.400]  easy to do she went to have her nuclear reservation and took some of that stuff that material and
[50:01.400 --> 50:07.000]  they reduced it back down to nothingness so that's one point but if i could throw in two more real
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.680]  quick if you don't mind sure go ahead sir okay uh i got something to talk to i was shocked and over
[50:12.680 --> 50:19.400]  the weekend and i was shocked and finally admitted that the 501c3 was really just a sham and he said
[50:19.400 --> 50:26.280]  that they scared all of his words to he said they scared all the the the clergy into thinking that
[50:26.280 --> 50:31.640]  they can't say anything about politics and he said what they can do is talk about the politics
[50:31.640 --> 50:38.680]  and certain candidates but they can't direct their cues into a certain candidate they can't make
[50:38.680 --> 50:45.160]  them vote for certain people but then also the third one i have is uh hold on hold on i want to
[50:45.160 --> 50:50.200]  hear more about al sharpton when we come back richard can you stay there for a minute all right
[50:50.200 --> 50:56.120]  thank you sir uh we're gonna come right back with richard then brad then michael and many others
[50:56.120 --> 51:02.600]  and we're gonna talk about the big trends of 2014 the facts are in the studies are legion
[51:02.600 --> 51:07.880]  sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and
[51:07.880 --> 51:13.960]  cognitive ability of the american people so why are the social engineers adding it to the water
[51:13.960 --> 51:19.880]  symbol dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not
[51:19.880 --> 51:24.360]  have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet but we can help to get it out of our

[54:17.640 --> 54:19.560]  for those that don't know ladies and gentlemen
[54:19.560 --> 54:26.600]  they can see that it's like arresting a student who writes an essay about a school shooting
[54:27.400 --> 54:34.200]  you've got school shootings going on everywhere and then a student writes a story about how
[54:34.920 --> 54:40.120]  they're upset about it happening and describing it and the police come and interrogate them and in
[54:40.120 --> 54:48.280]  some cases arrest people who write a fiction article about in one case one of those world war
[54:48.280 --> 54:53.160]  two games and how they like to play it and it talked about shooting soldiers so the police came
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.640]  or again the neighbor sees you playing with a nerf gun in the backyard so you're kicked out of
[54:57.640 --> 55:04.120]  school the school doesn't have that jurisdiction it's just government doing things that are illegal
[55:04.120 --> 55:10.120]  out of their jurisdiction criminal official oppression false arrest false imprisonment false
[55:10.120 --> 55:15.080]  fines and then having the judges in the courts and the culture go along with it the school has no
[55:15.080 --> 55:20.040]  right to suspend somebody for five days because a neighbor saw them playing with an orange nerf gun
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.560]  that neighbor needs to be put in a mental institution that's a real case those are real
[55:25.560 --> 55:31.640]  cases I just mentioned and I'm going back to the caller Richard in Texas my point is
[55:31.640 --> 55:36.760]  is this the same thing with 501c3 in the 1950s they had the big denominations of the world
[55:36.760 --> 55:41.480]  council of churches other Rockefeller globalist groups say look order your churches to become
[55:41.480 --> 55:50.120]  charities under 501c3 charitable faith organizations no longer churches churches are the first
[55:50.120 --> 55:56.040]  amendment the government has no jurisdiction that's why the Hopi Indians can you know take
[55:56.040 --> 56:00.680]  peyote that's illegal under federal law and other religious groups could take other drugs
[56:00.680 --> 56:05.320]  if it's really part of their religion because it's protected that's why voodoo people can you
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.680]  know chop the heads off of goats it's religiously protected or kill chickens you know the animal
[56:10.680 --> 56:15.160]  rights people don't like that the point is if you take away the voodoo people's rights they're
[56:15.160 --> 56:20.760]  going to take your rights and so it is a fraud this is not my opinion separation of church and
[56:20.760 --> 56:28.200]  state means you can't have the state saying we're Catholic or we're Protestant or we're Buddhist
[56:28.200 --> 56:34.280]  or we're atheist the state isn't in that business but it doesn't mean then you can't have a bible
[56:35.080 --> 56:39.960]  at public school and tell your friends about Jesus Christ at lunch but even in Texas they come
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.440]  and take your bible some cases throw them in the trash take the kids out or tell people
[56:44.440 --> 56:51.080]  that are valovictorians you can't talk about Christ or or after football game you can't
[56:51.080 --> 56:56.040]  tell the newspaper you want to thank Jesus well of course you can that's your free speech
[56:56.680 --> 57:00.360]  and it's the same thing it was the churches that led the revolution against King George
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.560]  so with the democrats they allow and the IRS allows the democratic churches to
[57:05.560 --> 57:10.280]  raise money do whatever they want but if it's a libertarian a conservative church you get audited
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.160]  you get harassed you get persecuted and that's all been you know out in the press but finishing up
[57:15.160 --> 57:18.760]  the minute and a half we have left I appreciate you're holding it's interesting words you run
[57:18.760 --> 57:24.280]  into Al Sharpton and what else did he have to say I was driving home from Houston and he had
[57:24.280 --> 57:29.400]  Andre Eglishon in his studio with him so I knew it would be a good time to bring that up and I also
[57:29.400 --> 57:33.800]  tried to bring up the fact that they've been using the the banks around the world world bank
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.840]  international my you know all the stuff you talk about to destroy the world's economies
[57:38.840 --> 57:43.320]  and I said the church should be talking about that and uh Andre Eglishon could vouch for everything
[57:43.320 --> 57:48.200]  I was saying but Al Sharpton is very clever he knew I was going to go to the drug running out of
[57:48.200 --> 57:53.080]  Afghanistan too and he kind of cut me off right there but he was fair enough to let me get everything
[57:53.080 --> 57:57.720]  out I will say that about him but I'm sure I mean Al Sharpton's a really smart guy he knows how the
[57:57.720 --> 58:01.880]  whole game works and he's playing along with the system and race baiting and everything else
[58:01.880 --> 58:09.000]  absolutely what was your last point go ahead oh yeah real quick my last point was Obama being the
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.440]  bloodline of the Illuminati related to Vlopi and failing all the rest of the people throughout history
[58:14.440 --> 58:22.760]  that's that's really hard I try to tell people that now if Obama's connected bloodline and why
[58:22.760 --> 58:28.760]  look at his birth certificate why look at Hawaii and Kenya and try to focus on his bloodline that's
[58:28.760 --> 58:35.960]  who he really is he's not a made man he's actually born into this I totally agree he's related to
[58:35.960 --> 58:46.120]  Dick Cheney on record you're absolutely right thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN Live.com today
[58:49.880 --> 58:54.600]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care

[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:21.080]  alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:32.600]  i'm going to continue with your phone calls at the bottom of the hour i'm going to give you my take
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.360]  on what i think the main trends of 2014 are going to be and why it's such a critical year
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:45.400]  we're also going to get into uh what the big trend is we began to see not just detroit but many
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:53.880]  areas uh in michigan illinois california you name it going bankrupt and we are in a depression
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:59.560]  i have a large extended family and a lot of them have been middle class upper middle class you name
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:05.880]  it uh working class they all have been hurt and their neighbors all think that they're in a recession
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.760]  or depression of course you know what a recession is is when your neighbor is out of work or going
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.080]  bankrupt it's a depression whenever you it's happening to you by every real benchmark and
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:23.160]  all the economists we've had on from mark faber to you name it across the board using real numbers
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:32.920]  we've been in a recession since 2008 and if you go just a year uh it then technically uh
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:40.520]  uh is called a depression we are in a very deep depression when you look at the real metrics
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:46.680]  but there are still pockets of wealth but it is is really scary and that's why they're gearing up
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.760]  with the whole police state you notice that they built before all this happened they know this bubble
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:57.080]  is going to implode or explode into world war three and and that's some of the trends i want
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.760]  to get into quite frankly i was going to cover it earlier i just want to write some notes during
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:05.560]  a break to kind of focus my thoughts on all the trends and what i think is most important because
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:14.040]  like a pinwheel or like a kaleidoscope the mind marvels and spins at least mine does just thinking
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:20.280]  of what an incredible time we're alive in right now but uh chicago you name it they're all getting
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.880]  ready to go completely belly up and their answer in chicago is double this tax triple that tax
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:33.880]  create this tax which will only further destroy wealth and drive people out it's amazing but the
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:40.680]  globalists don't care because it consolidates their power in fact they like making people poor
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.760]  that's what makes me so angry i hear about somebody eating bagels for
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:54.920]  Thanksgiving or i i see people that i've known who are doing well now who are going bankrupt and
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.000]  folks that came and pay for gas to drive to work and the family's breaking up in the
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.800]  society degenerating and then people more narcissistic more entertainment driven
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:07.960]  the spirit of this world is so powerful it's hard for even me to overcome
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:17.640]  and only through prayer and just trusting in god and do i have peace and i don't think i
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.720]  could handle the things i've gone through five years ago i couldn't have handled all the things
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:27.880]  that i see in my life and i guess that which does not kill you only makes you stronger but
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:35.240]  there's a bible verse about with great wisdom comes great sorrow and it it is a feeling of sorrow
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:45.240]  but it's also a very deeply fulfilling feeling to be discerning and aware and sensitive i'm glad
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:51.480]  i'm conscious and awake it's very powerful it's a very uh enlightening experience and i wouldn't
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:56.920]  want to be a zombie but i understand why the general public are just shuffling zombies letting
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:04.360]  the media program them because reality is big and it's lovely dark and deep on the surface
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:11.480]  and it has many good things in it but also many bad things and when you juxtapose the good things
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:17.640]  next to the bad things it makes the bad things even that much more abhorrent and it makes you see
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.840]  the bad things in yourself bad things that you don't follow through on bad things that you don't
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:30.600]  manifest but nevertheless you have the knowledge of the good and evil and so even having the knowledge
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:37.000]  of evil technology and by evil technology systems of manipulation to even understand the enemy is
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.760]  to become the enemy i wouldn't go as far as enders game and say is to love the enemy
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:51.400]  but you know the enemy's love of evil and knowing that passion is sharing that passion
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:57.480]  staring into the mind of satan we'll be right back say with us
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.800]  alex jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide

[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:18.040]  family fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:25.080]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:32.040]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously

[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.840]  well in japan the government is paying homeless people
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:38.440]  less than minimum wage to go in and clean out fukushima the tens of thousands a radioactive
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:46.040]  rods and plutonium and uranium there and almost everyone who did go in when it first exploded
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:52.680]  to try to emergency fix things have died now and it's come out in mainstream japanese media that
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:56.920]  the government was covering up the level of the radiation so the government just passed an executive
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:03.720]  order two weeks ago in the diet basically giving them martial law powers over information
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:12.040]  so there you have it coming up i'm going to break down the big trends of 2014 and why i think it's
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.760]  such a critical year we're also going to look at us public finance day of reckoning chicago is
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.880]  tackling the worst pension crisis in the us but methods that got it in a bind are still used
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.800]  across america i love how the globalist publications like the financial times of london
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:31.880]  that's able to attend belgerberg at the very top of the financial publication pyramid i love how
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:37.640]  they always just like in spain just like in greece just like in ireland just like in other places
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.680]  like iceland they're always acting like there's a way to fix it this was designed to bankrupt
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:48.440]  everything and take over this is how the globalists conquer you any farmer will tell you that when the
[01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:54.440]  farms 20th year comes up and you're going to pay it off that that a couple years before that comes
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:05.400]  up they will accelerate the whole note with a clause in the uh deed a clause in the contract
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:11.160]  to try to make you pay the last couple years in one lump summer they take it from you and the only
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:17.320]  reason that that stopped is because in the old days even up until the 70s bankers and savings
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:24.040]  and loan people that did that got shot in the head but americans don't act like that anymore we
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:30.120]  roll over and when you roll over gangsters come in they take over people think laying down is how
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:38.520]  you get liberty if you went into the wilds of say alaska and started rolling around on the ground
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:45.400]  and squealing like a dead rabbit wolves would come and eat you and we act like a dying squealing rabbit
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:54.520]  america's new anthem should be a varmint tape of a dying baby squirrel
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.960]  i mean that's the call we put out squealing oh take my rights oh spy on me oh checkpoints
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:07.160]  oh proctology exams on the highway oh teach my kids to rat on me because the scourge of drugs
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:11.480]  when the government ships the drugs in is trying to put the kids on adderall and riddlin and all
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:16.520]  these prozac drugs oh you know take kids that are five pounds overweight from their parents and put
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.320]  them in government custody to put them on seven different drugs and where they're five to seven
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.880]  times more likely to be sexually or physically abused i mean no one is looking at the threat
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:33.000]  and the fruits of this giant global government system let me tell you cherry pie didn't come
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.120]  out the end of this thing freedom and prosperity didn't come out of the end of it what comes out
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:45.640]  of it is slavery and poverty and ignorance and i don't want to say horse manure because horse
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.920]  manure is actually useful for crops this is beyond bs ladies and gentlemen bravo sierra and
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.360]  you've got to admit you've been cheated you've got to admit you've been conned you've got to admit
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.400]  you've been put in a lackadaisical television is what killed america and killed the world
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:09.000]  the question is can we come back from the dead people are caught in entertainment if one more man
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.840]  walks up to me on the street or at the grocery store and says hey you know you see the cowboys
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:19.800]  last night what'd you think i had three people come up to me today and talked to me about the
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:24.360]  cowboys last night and i looked at all of them i said man there's too much going on the real world
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:32.280]  to care about the cowboys and i went and ate dinner by myself late last night after that game
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.040]  and i was sitting there in a restaurant people were coming over to me who were my listeners but
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:42.600]  still bringing up the cowboys losing and i was just like man come on and and and all the reporters
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.680]  real serious like they're reporting on world war three about what's happening with football
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.440]  that's why we're slaves because people are experts and men get real serious about a game
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:58.680]  and so this morning i was watching a little bit of television watching different nfl games
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:05.560]  and what eclipsed from them and watching grown men who were supposed to be captaining
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.640]  starships by this point and they're supposed to be trailblazing you know undersea projects and
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.800]  are supposed to be leading and guiding their children and directing the culture and they're
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.920]  supposed to be leaders with goals are running around in little outfits in simulated combat
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:27.720]  with each other slapping each other on the butts and look i can get into the football i can sit
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:33.960]  there and learn all about it and it's a male soap opera and and and get into it i i get it
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.880]  but as our whole culture goes down the rat hole as our government funds al qaeda to attack russia
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.800]  to destabilize the olympics as saudi arabia promised to do three months ago because russia
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:53.960]  won't hand over syria to al qaeda as as the cashless society goes in as the robot cars at the streets
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:14:00.280]  as they set up the robotic slave systems in france and in uh of all places china to replace humans
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:04.760]  as the globalist announced that when they have all this in place in a robot army of drones
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.920]  in place they'll release the bio weapons and start the war against humanity
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.000]  i'm convinced they could release bio weapons right now and people would still go along with it
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.400]  and still go along with whatever they i mean it's it's it's horrible we're living in a hardcore
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:31.880]  science fiction movie and women are just incredibly on average so shallow so petty so insecure so
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:38.600]  stupid men so shallow so insecure i mean i remember being like 12 years old walking into a restaurant
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:42.920]  being self-conscious what people are looking at me i remember being a little bit like that but i mean
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:48.440]  now just have it not being self-conscious is so good but then i see other adults that are so
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:56.120]  self-conscious i don't care if they're rich or poor black or white and all the idiosyncratic stuff and
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:02.840]  all the neurotic stuff and all of the you know somebody in a fancier car than yours pulling up
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:08.440]  besides you and revving it so you look over so they can look down on your car and you just look over
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.920]  at them and it's just like you're not feeling bad because they have a nicer car than you
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:19.880]  you're feeling bad because they literally are that shallow narcissistically that they need to
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.320]  feel like a horse running up beside another horse that is faster than you and that psychology is
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:31.560]  just so base but that's how they manipulate everybody these are the issues that are so
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:36.200]  frustrating to see humanity becoming more decadent not more enlightened
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:47.080]  i mean i would be watching on the sat feed as the first explorers arrive on Europa
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.880]  and by the way with the technology the globals have had we could have been there 20 years ago
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:59.480]  probably are with probes at least we know they could already have basically giant extraction units
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.000]  on different planets we know have incredible resources and different planetoids and could
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.240]  already have huge off-work colonies and i would be watching the sat screens cheering on the settlers
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.800]  i mean that would be and you'd see a ship you know malfunction and its reactor blow up and
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:22.120]  that would be watching real men and women out there you know doing space jumps and and all of
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.400]  it i mean that's what i want not men in tight slapping each other on the ass excuse me
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:35.320]  i mean that we need to be going into space we need to be getting the life extension technology
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.720]  we need to be going into the deep earth we need to be going into the seas and if they
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:45.400]  built up trailblazers again if they built up leadership again humans would want that and
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.880]  would support it in the market of ideas and would support corporations and governments that get it
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:56.440]  and we could do anything together but we need goals look at all the palaces and temples and
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:03.000]  pyramids built my man before by ancients and we are building nothing but fraud and lies
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:09.480]  our civilization is not building anything but deception because the globalist already have
[01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:14.040]  all the advanced technology they're really giddy about it they're on power trips that's the ultimate
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:22.840]  wealth is knowledge and they are shuttering the world from human advancement and i don't like
[01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:32.440]  seeing myself and my family walled off in it i don't like losing humanity to this we're going to
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:36.120]  skip this network break as i'm behind going to calls let's go ahead and talk to brad and
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.440]  pencilvania thanks for holding here on the air what do you think the most important stories
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.040]  not the manufactured biggest stories but what are the most important stories
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.520]  the most important stories of 2013 and what do you see coming in 2014
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:56.760]  most important story 2013 i would say would be obama care number one
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:04.600]  false flags false flag terrorism to put a soft kill on firearms number two
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:12.840]  snowden close three and uh congress and the president's unpopularity right there with
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.160]  with the the other four what was number two again because i like your list you got obama care what
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:25.640]  was number two uh false flags in u.s which are creating a soft kill on firearms oh sure the stage
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:30.680]  some of the stage manufacturers shootings we know boston bombing was staged that's crazy you cover
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.560]  it better than anybody alex and that's and people like the like the one that they just recently had
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:40.360]  on the anniversary of uh sandy hook right i think you touched on it when i was listening to you i
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:45.320]  didn't hear you pounce on that enough saying hey it's on the anniversary it's probably another
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:52.600]  manufactured stage event but folks stopped him absolutely and he he was a liberal uh video game
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:58.360]  head atheist so a quote devout socialist who went in there to kill the conservatives
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.920]  that we write but the bigger my bigger point is it happened on the same day it's very no i
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:08.840]  agree they were trying to pull something off and it didn't go well and it was in colorado again
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.200]  keep it in our consciousness hey there's another one here's another one you got to take our guns
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:19.400]  you know i don't even have guns but i think everybody should because the tyranny's coming
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:26.280]  that's 2014 probably is why don't you have guns why yeah i just never have i mean i even
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:31.000]  it's no big deal once you go shoot one you're like this is the big deal just go get it get a revolver
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:36.840]  is your first gun 357 magnum it's all on tv where the lady shoots it she flies back there's really
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:42.680]  no kick on a 357 to speak of and i mean there's there's more kicking a blender when you turn it
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:49.800]  on to blend whatever you're making and just take the shooting range get a lesson at the shooting
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:54.600]  range and it's really no big deal they add such a mystique to firearms i mean there is a mystique
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:01.560]  to twin firing uh 50 cal barrett's with the armor piercing tracer at night i mean that's kind of fun
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:10.120]  hand firing a 50 cal's fun but what else do you see coming up in 2014 uh economic meltdown i know
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:15.160]  you've probably heard this already but uh i know lindsay wames has just got out a new video talking
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:21.240]  about uh economic reset or something like that currency reset something's gonna happen here soon
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.400]  because i mean they're like you always say they're all they're all prepared for it they're that's why
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:32.120]  they're getting the uh the the uh military in place to for the it's for the people there's no
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:39.800]  question ever since 9 11 as you said it's it's all been it's it's it's it's uh it's it's confusing
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:46.280]  from the people but it's it's not the it's not the uh middle east or the jihadis or whatever
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.880]  you want to say that they're focused on it's us they're coming they're just boomerang it back
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:54.520]  on the american people because the economy's gonna take a crap and we're all gonna be that's right
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:01.640]  up the creek that's right and that was that was always the plan the plan was always as they've
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:06.120]  done this in country after country testing it priming it they've got a hundred and i think it's
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:11.480]  12 point imf world bank plan that got leaked where they engineer this i mean that's why we know what
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:16.920]  they do it's like i'm a football coach to use that analogy and i have the other teams playbook
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:22.280]  i've sent spies in to steal it we have the playbook but in their case they published the playbook
[01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:27.640]  that's how dumb they think we are that is so frustrating that why do you think they are so
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:33.240]  open about a lot of what they do because most of us are clueless we're like you you know we're like
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:40.280]  you said we're dumb down to the point of you know until we get our butt kicked like we're gonna get
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:44.520]  it kicked here soon the next few years and people are not gonna wake up you know and then by then it
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:49.400]  may be too late like you always say well i agree i agree they have tested us and i appreciate your
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.320]  call excellent points brad thanks for calling hope you had a great christmas and a wonderful new
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:59.080]  year coming up at least we're here not being caught flat-footed but i'll be honest with you
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:05.720]  i am incredibly flat-footed when it comes to this because i know how they work i know how
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:12.600]  they operate i know what screen time does to children i know what gmo does i know
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:21.480]  how families and women and everything works but it's still it's one thing to know how something
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.480]  works it's another thing to have the will even in your own life to do things right and i'm a
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:33.240]  pretty good dad and good husband and things but there's a lot more i could have done where i've
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:38.920]  been so focused on fighting the new world order that in my own life i'm not that ready for what's
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:47.640]  coming i'm more ready than most i mean i live out in the countryside and i've tried to get ready
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:53.640]  but i'm just here warning people that's all i can do and there's no reason that they've
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:23:00.760]  got to implode the country the problem is they set up a system where it's like a self-propelling
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.680]  perpetual motion machine where they've basically got us to the point now where it'll be very hard
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:10.760]  for them to even reverse what they've done the only way to do it is to ride off all the derivatives
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:18.120]  arrest the globalist uh stop letting them invest 70 plus percent of all the tax money in offshore
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:24.920]  money inside the comprehensive angle financial reports yeah only about 25 percent of the money
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:31.240]  goes to even be invested uh in the budget and and that's by the way a public secret that i've
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:39.640]  been exposing for 16 years and no one will cover it or talk about it that's what i mean the it's
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:46.360]  just all a giant total fraud it's all a facade it's all a huge line that's why talk radio is
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:50.760]  being prepared to be dismantled across the board they've taken the money out of it they've taken
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.640]  the funding out of it the other big talk radio networks out there we're independent so we're
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:00.360]  different and able to fund ourselves because we operate on a much smaller budget uh but the big
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:07.240]  banks that own the large syndicators they just have unlimited trillions now why should banks loan
[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:14.200]  to anybody uh why should uh they even allow media to operate why should they keep funding all these
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:18.600]  networks that lose money they're just going to get rid of it all they're going to get rid of all
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.680]  the establishment media the establishment right wing media the establishment left wing media
[01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:30.680]  they're now defunding you people you're the traders that open the drawbridge at midnight and let the
[01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:37.480]  enemy in and now do you think the enemy that's taken the castle is going to put you in charge no
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:42.760]  they don't want you around they are going to take you and they are going to chain you up
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:50.760]  and they're going to politically slit your throat you people historically are the first on the list
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:56.440]  i hope you know what you've done and i hope you got enough money to get out of the western world
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.800]  because the new world order doesn't like you knowing where the bodies are buried they're
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:08.840]  going to come after you they always do fools ketler in the night of the long knives against the
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:15.800]  s.a. linen stall and all the purges you're going to be airbrushed out of history you little narcissistic
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:21.240]  nobodies reading off their playlist you didn't have the basic instinct to see evil coming down on us
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:29.640]  and to resist it you thought it was cute to join with the wickedness you thought you'd get power
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:38.920]  out of working with this long term fools you have given up reason for madness
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:51.000]  look at what you've done and look at what all of you in the pentagon going along with this have
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:57.240]  done you have destroyed your birthright you have destroyed your family we have been set up
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.160]  and thank god i was born into a family that was aware of this stuff and that i have never
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:10.360]  been part of it thank god that i'm not with you and i'm not on some high horse saying that the
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:15.400]  spiritual debt your families now owe to the world those of you that have been part of this
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:21.720]  the bad things that are going to happen to you from a reap what you sow karmic perspective you
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:29.320]  could say it makes the god-fearing soul i have shudder when i look at what is going to happen to
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:37.240]  you and i'm certainly not a good person either but i am aware of my evil i don't like it and
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:42.680]  i don't want to be part of it and i reject it but all of you out there who have served evil
[01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:49.400]  you better repent now before it's too late even if you don't believe in god folks you better get
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:54.360]  your gut straight get your head screwed on straight and make a conscious decision that you're not with
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:01.240]  this and then go out and reprieve yourself now and you will feel empowered you will feel alive and
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:07.080]  we could turn the tide but you've got to decide that you were wrong you've got to decide that you
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:11.640]  sold out to evil you've got to decide you lied to yourself you've got to look in the mirror all of
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:18.200]  us do and decide that we're going to be better people and by the way that's what's fulfilling
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:24.120]  when you do the right thing when you are honorable when you do have courage it's not fulfilling to
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:29.720]  be a minion of wickedness i'm going to stop preaching back to your calls michael in arizona
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:37.080]  you're on the air thanks for holding hello hey alex good talking to you again good talking to you

[01:27:52.440 --> 01:28:03.880]  2013 goes yes sir um i really there's been some good callers today but i want to re quote your
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.000]  phrase from yesterday that you had some great callers yesterday and they mentioned a lot of
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.280]  things and i remember this one particular guy that just conglomerated everything and he put in
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:21.800]  all the um snowden and obama care this and that and everything but one thing that hasn't been
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:30.200]  mentioned a whole lot is the radiation that's going into seafood coming from fukushima i did a
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:40.760]  research paper in college spring of 2011 that had to do with over fisheries and over the past 100

[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:32.760]  radio network let me just do this now i'm going to break down what i think the key trends of 2014
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:40.600]  are going to be and what we have to look forward to and i'm going to do more of this over the next
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:46.680]  few days and on the nightly news and i've directed uh my crew to write on these subjects as well
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.680]  because we need to really try to get people to focus in on what the real trends are not the
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:58.200]  fashion trends not the sports trends not the trendiness but the things that all that trendiness
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:04.920]  has meant to distract us from so that's just some of what's coming up briefly please don't forget
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:11.240]  this whole broadcast is listener supported and i've phased out sponsorship to a great extent
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:20.200]  just because i want to come back in the new year with a new formatted system of sponsorship
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:26.120]  that's more focused more researched because i want to make sure that all the sponsors i do have
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.400]  are absolutely the highest standard we already have the highest standards out there when you
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.520]  hear myself endorsing something the network has their own advertisers some are great i'm sure
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:43.480]  i just don't have time to research it and i just at a gut level will not promote something anymore
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:50.120]  unless i 100 know it's the best i just will not do it so that's why we have great sponsors
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.960]  a whole bunch of them a lot of them are great i just don't don't even have the personnel or the
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.600]  crew or the system to properly handle even the good sponsors we had so i'm revamping everything
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.360]  next year uh and we are funded by the products we sell by the prison planet dot tv memberships
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:08.200]  and we've been able to fund the operation and its expansion thanks for your support so i want to
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:13.000]  thank you for all your support over the years all the patriots and liberty lovers worldwide

[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:26.120]  glyphosate you name it there's a lot of other companies claiming this and that i could be
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:31.160]  selling those i don't i sell what i use what my family uses i've done the research i didn't
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.280]  have a filter company for two years because i couldn't find one that was good enough

[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:55.160]  or store dot com so water is the word to get 10 off at info or store dot com on their entire line
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:01.880]  or you can call toll three eight eight eight two five three three one three nine triple eight two
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:08.520]  five three three one three nine also we have in supply but it's running out again it's happening
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:13.080]  again and it'll be about four weeks till we get more it might sell out the next week uh we have
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:19.880]  the survival shield proprietary national academy of sciences certified nascent iodine unlike any
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.920]  other iodine out there it is true nascent and i'm not knocking the other alcohol based ones that
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.480]  taste like rocket fuel the doctors i've talked to say that's good as well but it's probably not
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:33.480]  really nascent we've had it looked at and tested some of the brands it's bound it's it's mixed with
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:39.720]  the alcohol uh it just doesn't have the same effect real nascent turns blue purple and so you
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:45.160]  will see that with our survival shield available at info wars life dot com info or store dot com
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:50.760]  also has a link there and the fluoride shield is the best value even over survival shield we do have
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:57.800]  that in it's in a two ounce bottle not a one ounce bottle so you get two ounces for 39.95
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:06.520]  not one ounce for 29.95 and it has the nascent iodine in it as well but five other systems
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:12.360]  organic the best out there shillig you name it known to absolutely detoxify not just not just
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:17.800]  fluoride but a whole bunch of other toxins and heavy metals and warning when you take this
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.960]  go to a physician beforehand because it's all legal lawful what they call you know FDA grass
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:30.920]  certified stuff that's known to be safe the highest standard the point is is that still we're so toxic
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:37.160]  that taking this stuff you know i i detoxed and i'm still detoxing i still lead an unhealthy
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.960]  lifestyle in many areas but people can see the difference in my face difference in my eyes difference
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  in clarity my family's seen it people around here that have been taking i've seen it i mean this is
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:52.120]  the real deal this is the real deal and i would challenge you in the new year to get a bottle
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:57.800]  of fluoride shield it's two ounces from so you get double for only ten dollars more and it has
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:03.480]  the nascent iodine in it as well so it's really the best value out there
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:13.000]  so m4slife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 we have a video there breaking down what's in it
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.360]  but i mean it's the real deal it will start detoxing you get ready for stuff to come out
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:24.360]  of your skin to come out other ways i'm just gonna leave it at that this is uh this is the real deal
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:29.880]  and i'm only four months into all this uh because i did it for several months before i

[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.320]  a bunch of down but i want to brainstorm with some more during breaks i really try to give you
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.920]  what in my mind what i think is going to happen in 2014 and what i think the main trends are
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:19.800]  and it's not that i'm not decisive it's just that there's so much there
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.440]  that i'll do it at the start of the next hour i'm going to go to your calls right now then
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:29.080]  i'll get into the vulgrad attacks uh sounds like something out of a movie talk about a barbarian
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:34.760]  named vulgrad uh the bombings of train stations and trolleys over there and saudi arabia saying
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:39.720]  they were going to do this a few months ago uh this is not a false flag from what i've seen
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:45.800]  because the motive is to screw up the look at the numbers of what does this winter olympics is
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.160]  meant to bring in i've seen numbers of six billion ten billion for prestige for russia maybe more
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:58.600]  i mean this is hey if you don't give us syria we're going to activate al-qaeda all across your
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:07.720]  southern flank your soft ruski underbelly and you can see the swiss army knife of al-qaeda how
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:11.720]  it's used against america to take our liberties it's used against the russians the criminal bankers
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:18.200]  are using it and i don't think i've been predicting that you're going to see massive false flags all
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:25.480]  over the world by al-qaeda forces and by false flags al-qaeda is a tool of the banksters so that's
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:29.960]  the false flag and that's the big hoax to go alex you don't believe there's muslim extremists
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:36.120]  i've never said they aren't i'm not saying that guys from the army go and wire the world trade
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:41.800]  center with bombs inside criminal groups plant the bombs in the buildings they had evacuation
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:46.600]  shutdowns of whole floors for months doing construction where the bombs went off they have
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.600]  people that get on board who are double agents we know working for the cia who also work for
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:55.720]  saudi intelligence on record that's been declassified that came out in congress that some of those
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.560]  guys were double agents bare minimum but then you're not supposed to talk about that no that went on
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.240]  and then whatever really happened the the only real cell phone calls cell phones don't work
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:12.360]  about 4 000 feet i've flown i don't know it's not exaggerate 40 50 times since the 9 11 and i always
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.720]  obnoxiously i wanted to fly next time and have a somebody follow me and shoot video of this
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:23.160]  where i'm going to be on the phone taking off from austin and within about 2 000 feet it cuts out
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.800]  i've gotten as high as about three four thousand before you ask how i know i can see radio towers
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:32.680]  that are a thousand feet tall until uh the point and then you know but basically gues to make my
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:37.480]  height the point is you're in the air two minutes your cell phone drops sometimes a minute everybody
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:43.800]  knows that but now oh the FCC looks at authorizing cell phones those are cell phones like on a cruise
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.200]  ship if you're on a cruise ship 500 miles from galveston or a thousand miles your cell phone
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:58.680]  isn't working to to austin when i call family it goes through a big hub that goes to a satellite
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:05.720]  from the ship and that's what they're authorizing for airlines to charge you when you fly just like
[01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:11.720]  you have the internet now on airplanes but i've seen these articles discrediting alex jones look
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:18.520]  cell phones are going to work the FCC is going to do it the FCC is looking at i'm putting high
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:26.440]  powered satellite links and other systems on the planes so you can use the the the cell phones that
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.680]  are already there in data packages with internet like on virgin lannick and others that have come out
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:35.400]  within the last two years man the ignorance of people oh look cell phones now work in the sky
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:42.920]  there were supposedly hijacker calls that were made at 33 000 feet from non-airphones and the FBI
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:48.280]  to their credit went and looked at the solicitor general claiming his wife had called him those
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:54.440]  phone calls were not made my wife called me when the hijackers were on board and drank the 30 000
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:00.440]  plus feet and and no one called there the only real calls were from air phones which again go through
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:09.240]  a coupler link it's old technology and it was sturdices saying there's gas i can't breathe the
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:15.880]  only two real calls were there's a bomb we've been told to stay where we're at but we can't breathe
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:21.640]  there's a gas and the intel the best intel we've got and high-level people i've talked to who weren't
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:27.320]  involved in it but our high-level analysts have have broken down to me from the airlines and other
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.320]  places i'm just gonna leave it at that that what they believe is they told them it was a drill
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:36.200]  just like james wood saw mohammad and others do a drill of a hijacking and a bomb takeover with
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:42.280]  air marshals on flights two weeks before 9 11 they thought it was another drill which they have
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.760]  the guys get on board gas is released it's everybody be calm we're just doing a drill get
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:53.800]  it's a bomb you know things sturdices call they release a gas knock everybody out the guys in
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.960]  the drill don't know it remote control takes control the aircraft i remember being made fun
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:00.680]  of being told there's no such thing as remote controlling aircraft they were remote controlling
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.640]  aircraft in world war two not just from the german side but jfk's older brother who was
[01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:11.080]  going to be the guy that they were going to run for president but joe kennedy jr he died in a chase
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:24.200]  plane a fighter plane directing multiple multiple b17s loaded with explosives that's how that's
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:29.080]  how the allies had drones they didn't have the v1s v2s and stuff the germans had that were pilotless
[01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:33.960]  they would have chase planes with radio and he was piling the plane while making adjustments
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:39.080]  steering multiple drone drone weapons and then they sent up a bunch of german i think it was
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:44.520]  folk wolves they said were talked to but the ones that took him out was it folk wolf 109s
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:51.720]  point is is that is that this is the type of stuff that goes on ladies and gentlemen
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:46:01.560]  that's calling the plane people's wolf but the issue here is i'm ranting and said i'd go to your
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.800]  calls see i can't go into any subject you start talking about because it's so frustrating those
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:13.400]  phone calls were fake the only two real air phone calls said we can't breathe there's a gas
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:21.160]  i don't know what happened on 9 11 but the official story has more holes in it than a sieve
[01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:28.840]  than a colander than the swiss cheese moon of indoor all right let's go to your phone calls
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:36.360]  thank you for holding john in wyoming you're on the air go ahead hi elix hey buddy i think the probably
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:44.520]  the ongoing cover-up of ben gazi is probably the biggest story of 2013 because they're still lying
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:49.640]  about it they're still covering it up all the networks are covering it up because i exposed
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.000]  this too as you have been doing for for quite some time i exposed this in the letter to the editor
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:02.200]  on september 8th and it was a long thing and i exposed the fact that ambassador stevens and
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.480]  his colleagues were murdered because they were complaining about all of the chemical weapons
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:12.680]  and automatic weapons and stinger missiles that the cia was funneling through ben gazi
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:20.200]  to the al qaeda elements in syria and of course of course i've been widely criticized by the
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:25.160]  lapdog news media and some of their minions out there but let me tell you a couple of things
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:33.800]  that have happened recently here if i may uh the county commissioners these uh lapdogs for
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:41.320]  agenda 21 on the 17th of december past and ordinance which requires people living along
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:47.320]  the creek to build uh any structures at least one foot above the flood plain
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:54.840]  plain so it's purely agenda 21 and out of and again most of the houses are already in a 100
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:00.280]  year flood plain and this is all global agendas where they basically restrict most of the property
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:06.920]  but then unrestrict their property selectively increasing the value of their property and out of
[01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:12.680]  more than 20 000 people living in sherryton county wyoming only three of us showed up to
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:18.440]  complain about these and of course they are always given the kid glove treatment by the
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:26.760]  lapdog prostitute news media now also friday i found out this last friday the 27th that the
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:33.880]  previous day thursday the 26th that at least four b1 bombers were cruising around the area
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:40.760]  see if you go to uh ellsworth air force base on the east side of rapid six didn't you just have
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:48.280]  didn't you just have one crash out there while back uh no but uh the b1 bombers are controlled out
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.720]  of ellsworth air force base oh and i think there was one crash this year out west but go ahead
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:49:00.440]  yeah it was further it wasn't around here but uh they had four b ones cruising around the area
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.720]  and this is the same air force base that controls the drones that drop on people's heads all over
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:11.400]  the world and it's the same air force base that sends these b ones anywhere in the world to drop
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:18.280]  bombs on them 24 hours a day and of course the lapdog prostitute news media that we have here
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:25.320]  in wyoming doesn't cover anything whenever you go up there is i did to stop this agenda 21 item
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:31.800]  that the county commissioners passed unanimously and i tried to stop it and i said who are you
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:38.680]  going to emulate the founding fathers when they crafted the bill of rights in 1791 or carl marx
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:45.960]  when he crafted the communist manifesto in 1848 i said one of the planks of the communist manifesto
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:51.880]  is the abolition of private property ownership so what are you people doing you're using over
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:58.440]  regulation and over taxation to accomplish the same goals to drive people off their property
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:03.320]  because of over regulation and over sure that's the plan i got to jump here in a minute what do
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:08.920]  you think's coming in 2014 i think you're going to see all kinds of like you said false flag
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:16.040]  operations you're also going to see uh ben bernanke and his cronies now janet yellen
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:23.880]  further devalue the dollar the dollar is going to very likely collapse sometime in 2014 and they're
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:30.600]  going to have all kinds of uh false flag operations so they can give themselves an excuse to raid
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:38.440]  people's houses to confiscate their firearms i hear you i hear you my friend thank you so much

[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:20.280]  little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody british and a town in new or
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:25.560]  leans we fired our guns and the british kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:31.240]  ago we fired once more and they began to run down to mississippi to the guffam xico
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:38.920]  we looked down a river and we see the british come and they must have been a hundred of beating
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.960]  on the drums they stepped so high and they made the bugles ring we stood beside our cotton veils
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:48.440]  didn't say a thing we fired our guns a lot of times i cover most of the news in the first hour
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.600]  they'll be doing that the third hour today and giving you my trends on 2014 we're taking your
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.840]  calls on what you think the most important stories of 2013 were i think the increasing
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:03.240]  radiation levels next year it's going to be that giant wave that's taken two plus years to get here
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:11.160]  from fukushima of debris just untold tons of it is to be hitting the west coast the next three to
[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:15.880]  four months it's going to start in the next month but just continue piling up so that's
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:21.320]  that's one of the trends um but syria war not going the way the globalists wanted they're now
[01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:25.880]  lashing on it russia clearly like saudi arabia said we're going to use al qaeda to attack you we
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:31.880]  run them i think that's really the big trend as people are waking up but if you're not awake
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:40.680]  you'll just buy anything or maybe that's not even it the system knows they can't hide what they do
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:49.240]  anymore so saudi arabia were 15 of the 19 hijackers supposedly came from on 9 11 openly runs al qaeda
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:57.240]  against syria libya egypt and now russia and says we're going to start bombing right before the
[01:55:57.240 --> 01:56:02.360]  olympics and we're going to bomb the olympics this is letting them know they're serious they just
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:11.080]  bomb twice where the olympics are coming killing more than 30 people and our media is like increase
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.520]  security in new york and other areas after al qaeda groups at russia and this is the criminal
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:23.400]  media and the criminal hijack government attacking russia and then even using their attack thinking
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:28.680]  we're so dumb to go and we're going to take your rights because you saw what's happening in russia
[01:56:28.680 --> 01:56:33.640]  with the al qaeda and that's why i get so angry at tsa people because they're they're getting
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.440]  radiated all day they're having their rights taken to i don't dislike them as people but they'll do
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:42.680]  the chat down oh where are you going mr jones and i go let me guess you know i'm a listener

[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:17.960]  man the government runs al qaeda and then you want to make me a suspect our stinking government's
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.800]  been taken over by criminals and they're bombing the russians right now we're lucky the russians
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:27.720]  don't start attacking us but they know it's global is doing it but i'm telling you the saudi arabian

[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:04.440]  fame at the end of the day in fact it's a prison what i care about is not letting these scum win
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:11.720]  and take over and make me and my future family of slaves i care about survival and it makes me mad
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:16.520]  that the criminals that run our country that have hijacked it had been gauzy like the collars
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:21.000]  that were getting them nerve gas and missiles and all the rest of it and then they all get caught
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.880]  lying and nobody gets in trouble and i'm just sitting here it's all a joke it's like when
[01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:29.080]  a cop pulls me over and asks if i have any drugs in the car and i'm like listen the government
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:37.000]  brings in most drugs do i look like i'm on drugs buddy boy i'm tired of being treated like a suspect

[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:34.520]  state-run media released a press release by the president of china
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:44.120]  preparing for war with the united states this is so out of control and we're going to
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:47.320]  continue with your phone calls i'm gonna take a few now at the start of the next segment i will
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:53.480]  give you my trends for 2014 uh let's go to truth raider calling from oragon you're on the air
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:58.360]  thanks for calling in hey there there's the leader of the truth of the world how you doing
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:06.760]  brother yeah i tell you the leader of the world is the devil yeah yeah that's unfortunately and
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:11.880]  we're all at battle to try to displace him until the return of our lord jesus christ that's right
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:17.800]  i'm in anyway brother a couple of things most of the callers great callers are calling today
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:23.480]  but i'm i'm afraid they stole my thunder snap uh but anyway a couple of the other things what
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:30.840]  happened in 2013 my take on it was at the beginning of the year going on pierce morgan show getting
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:36.520]  some exposure and being able to tell the nation things that they haven't heard before that's
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:41.560]  that's that's one of the big things yeah i don't tend to talk about myself unless it's educational
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:46.120]  to show how they do tricks and so i guess there is a reason i can do that guys i know it's here
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:50.840]  but i can't find it will you print me that la time saying i was the number one oh here it is
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:02:00.600]  yeah number one uh story uh of uh 2013 um politically was alex jones on pierce morgan
[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:06.520]  but notice all the things they picked they believed were balkanizing so that's their main goal
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:13.720]  but alex jones versus pier morgan i don't think it was balkanizing it it actually stated that they
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:19.800]  are trying to take our guns to enslave us so i got outside of his debate i circumnavigated
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:23.400]  his little control paradigm outside the box that's why they didn't have me back
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:29.160]  is because we won that debate we kicked his butt go ahead yes exactly that's what you did is you
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:34.680]  changed that you broke that and that's one of the biggest stories that you're in and of course all
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:38.200]  throughout the years by the way you know who did that it was pointed out to be like three months
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:43.160]  after i didn't even know this matt drudge tweeted cnn i'm going from memory on this i remember seeing
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:48.840]  oh wow i go back to memory matt drudge tweeted to cnn saying you should have alex jones on pierce morgan
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:56.440]  so again that's matt drudge just like out there never talking just keeps walking spreading his
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:03:01.880]  magic go ahead right yeah that going on howard stern all of that being able to be recognized
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.680]  and then people you know like your persona they they they like that you were speaking the truth
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:12.200]  and you were different from the mainstream media um all the robots that that spit out the propaganda
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:17.800]  with their scripts uh the other thing that uh i know it's personally in my life this year all
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.920]  the three groups that i've gone to all the truth groups the ufo conference uh 9 11 truth alliance
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:29.480]  and the red pill meetings have the growth of the attendance has grown exponentially throughout this
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:34.280]  throughout this year well listen i mean so-called conspiracy and rabble rousing as the media calls
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:39.480]  it criticize obama carry your rebel rouser don't believe known liars your conspiracy terrorist uh
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:44.680]  you know got an x convict you know con artists live in x door to you don't trust him you're weird
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:48.360]  you're supposed to trust known criminals that's what the government is i mean they are the main
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:53.640]  suspects historically that's what the founders told us and so of course the so-called conspiracy
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:59.480]  culture is growing as people try to find out what's really going on questioning is now being a heretic
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:07.720]  well welcome to planet heretic the system has lost the public exactly yeah and going into 2014 i think
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:11.800]  the biggest things that are going to be coming down the pike well of course we've got the 2014
[02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:16.920]  false elections coming up the selection processes that as you guys would would call it presidents
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:21.560]  are not elected they're selected so that's the big thing that's going to be coming up and probably
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.320]  the revelation of who that guy really is in a white house i call him frankie davis jr that's
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:32.760]  why i think he is i think he's absolutely not obama he's an imposter i agree with dreams of my
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:37.640]  real father i've seen the photos of him uh he would spend time with frank marshall davis every
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:43.480]  summer his grandfather would bring him to him when he was a communist pornographer uh that's
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:47.480]  why they created the whole kenya thing and said he was born in kenya and his harvard deal and why
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:53.000]  michelle said it before the election they were using that as a distraction beforehand he's not
[02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.040]  really from kenya he is the son of frank marshall davis i think it's incontrovertible
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:05.080]  why does the united states spend the largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:11.160]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism
[02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:18.600]  and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat our food is devoid

[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:27.240]  you are the resistance well i've already told you a lot of basic ideas i have about 2014 but
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:38.680]  domestically give the real libertarian constitutionally based tea party does not get
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:47.640]  from the numbers i've seen 30 40 seats new seats in the house if if they're unable to use been

[02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:01.480]  that message out as the alternative and yet substantive gains in the house to block the rhinos
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:05.960]  who vote with the democrats for every form of corruption and dismantling and looting of this
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:12.760]  country if they don't go out aggressively and point out that we're going into classical tyranny
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:18.120]  and and really call the bureaucracy and obama and the republican leadership traders
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:24.440]  and enemies of america then they're not fighting back when you're being overrun and dominated
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:29.880]  you've got to tell it like it is and yet it sounds extreme to say we have total criminals that have
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.680]  hijacked the country and are shutting it down on purpose and attacking the family and trying to
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:39.080]  bankrupt us and make us dependent on government to domesticate us but that's what the globalists
[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:47.880]  say that's what it is i would imagine if you for whatever reason we're a worker in somebody's
[02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:53.560]  basement and accidentally a locker fell over and there were two dead bodies in it and you'd get out
[02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:58.120]  of the house as soon as you could and call the police and you'd feel weird on 911 saying i'm a
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:04.040]  worker i was putting in some vents in this basement there's dead bodies but there are dead bodies so
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:10.280]  you it's it's real it happened i've been on the highway multiple times and rendered aid
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.480]  in a couple cases of people that died the couple cases of folks that didn't
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.600]  i saw corvette explode and flip racing somebody when i was a teenager and we pulled over and
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.520]  helped him and i was blood spraying and arms chopped off and everything else and when you see
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:28.520]  something like that it's it's like it's not real corvette and other cars zoom past you turn a tire
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:35.240]  blows out flies over explodes over the medium spinning in the air blowing into pieces bodies flying out
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:45.080]  other car slams in rolls three teenagers in the corvette one sitting in the console
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:55.480]  and it's that we don't expect things like this to really happen we cannot believe it and so
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:11:00.600]  that guy's crazy you know he says that there's giant debris fields that took two plushers to
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:04.760]  get here that are now arriving up and down the entire west coast of north america
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:12.040]  with uranium and plutonium all over it but that's a fact that's that's mainline japanese news
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.040]  it's a fact they put cancer viruses in all the major vaccines that get tested
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:22.840]  you could say it's an accident in production no it's not they're doing it on purpose it's a fact
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:28.440]  and you could just look this up and get the cdc's own documents from the 70s and they're scanned
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:34.680]  online where they admit over 100 million people contracted and died of exotic cancers that are
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:41.560]  now common from the polio vaccine and that they and then they have a pbs special where the scientists
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:44.360]  that worked with sock to develop it said well we decided there's too many people
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:49.640]  and so so what if it had sv 40 and all these other viruses i mean
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:56.680]  it's insane that sounds completely insane but it is insane it's insane that the head of
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:12:03.240]  saudi arabian intelligence three months ago in russia in a conference in front of the entire
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:09.800]  russian general staff said we're going to launch our forces all along the southern border of russia
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:19.240]  dagestan tizhikistan chechnya russia proper if you were going to attack the olympics leading up
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:25.800]  to it and daring it and that was in august i said three months ago that's longer man time flies
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:30.600]  four five months ago wow time flies saudi threatened russia with olympic terrorist attacks
[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:36.120]  unless it abandons syria support and then there's the article in the newscast about it
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:43.720]  or prince bandar sultan bandar literally came face to face with the russian
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:50.280]  staff and putin and said we're going to attack you i mean that is ballsy ladies and gentlemen
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:56.600]  to say the least that's the only term to describe it and the russians say okay you roll missiles
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.280]  up against this in ukraine we're going to roll medium range nukes in i mean this is really
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:05.640]  happening and don't forget on 888 the start of the last olympics they always play these games
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:09.320]  it's all about the international stage and what happens at the meetings behind the scenes when
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:15.080]  world leaders are together that they launched an attack on russian held areas as city south of
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:19.720]  city abkhazia and our media said russia had attacked georgia and then when i came out and
[02:13:19.720 --> 02:13:25.400]  pointed that out they had neocon cia known operatives come out and say i was a russian agent
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.680]  because i said let's not attack russia and have a nuclear war and then the russians actually rolled
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:38.520]  missile systems in mobile missile systems and said we're preparing to nuke nato forces massing at
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:45.240]  the airports because the u.s was going to with nato back up the georgians in some weird war with
[02:13:45.240 --> 02:13:49.160]  the russians and the russians said we're not going to have a vietnam border war with you a
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:55.880]  conventional war you call a police action we're going to have a nuclear war and they said you've
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:00.600]  got two hours this is on television their chairman joins his their chairman said we're gonna we've
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:09.400]  been authorized to begin uh uh using uh intermediate tactical nuclear weapons on your forces
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:15.560]  and the united states of nato pulled back and the russians pulled out back to their border
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:22.600]  and now our crazy banker run governments bringing missiles in they've got al-qaeda attack on the russians
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.240]  and the russians don't want nuclear war so they're sitting back and taking it but i mean
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:36.920]  the trend in 2014 is war you've got a global ponzi scheme coming down the globalist want to
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:44.520]  take down the world into the this new cashless str system where they get a hundred trillion per
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:52.040]  decade in carbon taxes and by the mile taxes and uh obama care foreign corporate taxes they
[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:56.520]  davos said this four years ago they said through national health care transfers through carbon
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:03.640]  taxes through national vat's and self taxes paid into this new consortium of the imf world bank
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:11.160]  oecd federal reserve bank of england we will get 100 trillion a year again on the people of the left
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.480]  and they couldn't get congress to pass that so obama did it with an executive order this year
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:23.240]  and by the way that's being tagged on now to your power prices gasoline you name it not even executive
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:28.520]  order he just put in a microwave regulation that they would start carbon taxing but if you don't see
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:35.960]  it on the bill it's just i mean we're living in cuckoo land folks we're in a dictatorship i think
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:42.040]  that's the fact 2014 is going to see an accelerated awakening but we're going to be in the weird
[02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:46.760]  position of armed paramilitary illegitimate governments robbing and stealing everything
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:49.880]  we're going to know they're doing it we're going to see the depression getting worse
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:55.640]  it will probably implode they'll call it an emergency like 2008 but it'll be much bigger
[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:59.320]  and global and they'll have bigger bail ins of our private bank accounts as they're now
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:03.640]  announcing in europe in the us where the private banks will actually take money out of your bank
[02:16:03.640 --> 02:16:08.520]  account and the yuppies will all go along with it because the stock market will you know plunge by
[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:13.880]  10 000 points something like that it'll probably go up to 20 and it'll drop down to 10 000 and
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:17.640]  then everybody'll freak out and they'll say well they've got to take 20 out of our bank account
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:23.560]  to back up these other bad loans and derivatives but don't worry the market will go back up and
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:28.120]  the yuppies will allow 20 i'm guessing that'll be the number watching them other countries
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.760]  and then they'll go actually it's 40 but we're not going to say who and then they'll never say
[02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:37.240]  exactly what the amount is so it'll individually happen to you and the media won't talk to you
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:42.280]  it'll be like a tree fell in the forest nobody heard the sound
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:45.000]  they'll just take the money out of your account
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.600]  now we could be like iceland and find out that 90 plus percent of the debt is not ours
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:57.240]  it's a fraud and arrest the finance ministers that took the icelanders a year of demonstrating
[02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:02.120]  and not complying and not paying parking tickets and getting him police face and bureaucrats face
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:06.200]  and and running into banks and pulling their money out and the britishans said we're going
[02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:12.680]  to arrest any icelanders basically coming to england uh because england basically was running
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:19.240]  iceland uh and you're a terrorist we're going to treat all icelanders money as terrorist money and
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:22.760]  just take it if you try to get it out of the country and the icelanders started suing them
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:26.600]  and arresting people and and the british government had to back off you can type in
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:33.480]  there's one in guardian headlines you name it uh england or uk uses anti-terror laws on iceland
[02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:41.080]  and depositors is is one of the headlines and they just said no i'm not a terrorist i'm good
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.400]  you're bad you're arrested how dare you say i'm a terrorist
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:52.920]  and so the trend is the enemy's going to come in like a flood folks the the walls are down the
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:57.320]  shields are down the enemy's flooding in and even the dumbest people now know we're under attack
[02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:02.600]  and you're meant to know about the attack now and you're meant to just roll over and you're
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:07.240]  meant to go into the crisis and just get into a catatonic state where i'll just do what i'm told
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:11.880]  they think you're done they think you're going to roll over they want to bankrupt you once and for
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:19.720]  all there it is uk uses anti-terror laws to seize icelandic bank assets of depositors bloomberg
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:28.040]  now the terrorist was alistair darlin doing that of the bank of england
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:33.640]  and so you you want to know the trends it's it's it's they're going to try to start a war with russia
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:39.720]  the globalists are deep with the communist chinese i don't know if it's a double triple quadruple
[02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:43.640]  cross but they're definitely gearing up for some of the conflict or proxy war with china
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:48.040]  and the chinese presidents come out and order the pl a to prepare for war major changes in

[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:23.400]  to live in a country like that where they even reach outside the nation my grandfather worked
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:29.160]  in high school in college with a major inventor who was german in dallas because my grandfather was

[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:20.600]  i've seen the critical battle for the heart and soul of america will we punish the incredibly
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:25.320]  out of control criminals that have hijacked the federal government will we go after obama for
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:31.400]  bengasi gate obama care will we go after the republican leadership and get rid of all of these
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:37.000]  blue blood globalist like bainer and all the rest of them he's not a blue blood himself
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:44.440]  he's another middle class working class shell out to tyranny another narcissistic you know guy
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:49.240]  that just parties all day long just like obama that's why the two get along together and it
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:55.320]  wouldn't be bad if they like to go out and party if they weren't such scumbags i mean you guys are
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:25:00.040]  gutting this country for a bunch of crooks you're their frontman and then you all organized this
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:07.480]  is the year with the full out assault of mordor against minus tear if you want to use that analogy
[02:25:07.480 --> 02:25:15.240]  the white city and if they're able to bring it down they win because if they can fully get america
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:21.880]  behind the world government and behind doing all of this and go from being a bad actor to being pure
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:28.200]  evil they can do anything i mean if they can double triple quadruple your prices and have it be a
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:34.280]  foreign tax to big banks though insurance companies they can do anything that's how tyranny works so
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:39.320]  there is a big awakening happening but those that aren't waking up are getting more narcissistic
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:48.440]  more mentally ill mental illness breakups delusion is getting worse everywhere
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:53.320]  all the numbers show it i did not talk to people that are in management and companies across the
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:59.480]  board the people are either waking up or they are becoming totally obsessed with television
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:05.960]  and how men are all idiots and and and their girlfriends treat them bad and and that's why
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:10.840]  the girl gets the good-looking guy and all that does is make people break up and the family under
[02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:16.040]  assault and children being taught uh you know how to have sex with each other pedophilia is being
[02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:22.600]  mainline in 2014 it is just incredible all the trends you're going to see another push to bring
[02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:27.800]  down syria for al-qaeda i think you will see more false flags mass shootings that are staged
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:32.040]  more boston bombing type situations i think they're going to try that again to divert away from
[02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:37.640]  impeachment i think you will see a move towards impeachment of obama i think you will see the
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.080]  tea party even though there's election fraud and the whole political system against them
[02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:46.840]  the real tea party not the counterfeit that's how they come at you i think they will get more than
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:56.840]  20 seats in the house worldwide 2014 it's the same agenda worldwide uh you uh you see uh germany
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:27:04.040]  and others being told that they're going to have to accept unlimited foreigners into their country
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:08.840]  who all get free welfare to further bankrupt the nation uh you're going to see a big push for that
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:14.680]  here obviously here's the financial times of london u.s public finance day of reckoning i predict
[02:27:14.680 --> 02:27:22.280]  that in 2014 you will see more than 500 cities and towns go bankrupt well that's a very conservative
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:27.800]  number and i think more than 20 of those will be major cities this has all been designed uh you
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:32.520]  will see chicago technically go completely bankrupt but they won't call it that they'll call it
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:39.560]  restructuring uh you're going to see the population go from 49 million on food stamps to about 80
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.920]  million in food stamps in the next three years if they have their way uh you're going to see
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:53.720]  the robot takeover you're going to see driverless cars on every state highway
[02:27:54.680 --> 02:28:00.280]  you're going to see uh more layoffs at industry everywhere and people being replaced with robots
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:04.200]  even though they're not performing as well it doesn't matter the globalists call that rnd they
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:09.160]  want to replace us to make us obsolete as the ultimate tool of political control you're going
[02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:14.440]  to see super bugs spread and kill millions but the media will quietly blame it on the flu
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:20.200]  i've confirmed with hospitals across the state uh that they have it's all over the country but east
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:27.160]  texas almost every hospital is an overflow turning people away with mass death happening and it's
[02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:30.600]  being kept very very quiet because the government doesn't want to know when it does come out they
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:38.040]  say it's the flu it is not the flu it is drug resistant staff uh and drug resistant uh other
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:47.320]  bacterium strains um associated again that's in roiders uh with the deadly antibiotics they're
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:52.920]  giving chickens now and other animals that are kept in in in hellish conditions and you're like
[02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:57.880]  oh so what about the chicken the point is they're in these hell conditions covered with mites and
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:01.960]  their beaks cut off so they don't kill themselves because they're in such hell and they're and
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:08.680]  they're in cages the sides of their body being force fed and and their and and their legs break
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:15.480]  because they're so fat you are eating all those antibiotics and the chemicals and the stress
[02:29:15.480 --> 02:29:24.840]  hormones and so you basically are taking on the the concentrate the the food boarded the reverse
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:34.520]  of a concentration camp the pesticide filled super antibiotic filled chickens and turkeys
[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:39.000]  particularly those are the really bad ones you were taking all that on so you're now a petri
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.800]  dish you create super bugs so i predict you're gonna see super bug outbreaks that dwarf this year
[02:29:43.800 --> 02:29:46.200]  i'm gonna tell you more what i think's coming next year stay with us

[02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:41.880]  want men to do and the creator of hbo's entourage duck dynasty would be better off if gay people
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:48.840]  got to shoot at phil robertson yeah that's that's uh that that's amazing amazing
[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:52.680]  tolerance right there isn't it ladies and gentlemen
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:05.400]  last night i was up here working and i remember that case that state judge who was uh
[02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:12.840]  uh spanking his 16-year-old daughter because she'd stolen something and she was fighting him and
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:18.680]  not taking the spanking so he was yelling and screaming at her dominating her and i mean quite
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:27.480]  frankly if they caught us fighting in the fieldhouse when i was like 14 that's what they do to us
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:32.120]  and they take us in there with big wooden paddles and spank us and then they could keep
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:36.680]  control of the situation they'd scream at us nowadays you do that the coach would be arrested
[02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:40.920]  instead you go out you act out of control in the cops taser you and your head hits the concrete
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:47.080]  and you die or you go to prison and get raped or stabbed see you will end up getting brought into
[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:51.960]  line but but they're gonna try to ban spanking they already try to do it by fiat i was watching
[02:35:51.960 --> 02:35:57.240]  the show going it was so horrible and she videotaped him spanking her and the reason he's yelling at
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:03.080]  her is she won't bend over and get spanked and the dad's freaking out because his daughter's been
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:12.040]  caught stealing and he is freaking out and it's like yeah he'd never spank me until then and it
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:17.560]  was horrible and that's that's what it was is that and then the wife divorces him i forget the name
[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:23.640]  my videotaped some of it on my iphone was on msnbc and and they were all acting like it was like oh
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:29.240]  my gosh it's so horrible that he's yelling at her and that's what happens you don't spank somebody
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:36.120]  when they're five years old lightly when they steal something then it won't matter when they're 16 if
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:40.760]  you beat them you didn't do it early enough and and that's what's happened to our society and by
[02:36:40.760 --> 02:36:44.680]  the way i haven't really even had to use corporal punishment with my children i mean it's it's you
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:48.920]  can use reward and and all the rest of it but they will try to dominate you at one point and
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:52.280]  you know if your kid tries to walk out in the street the third time when they're three years old
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:58.840]  and won't listen you've got to spank them and make them get upset you understand hey i'm spanking you
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:04.760]  because if you walk out into a street the car will run over you and kill you it will spank you
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:11.880]  and so there's a big push that is to get rid of parents being the parents and then the state will
[02:37:11.880 --> 02:37:17.960]  spank you with serotonin reuptake reuptake inhibitors the state will spank you with that
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:24.200]  fetamines to burn your brain out that cause heart palpitations heart expansion heart conditions brain
[02:37:24.200 --> 02:37:29.720]  shrinkage retardation of growth retardation of iq but that's okay it's okay to put people on
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:36.120]  hardcore drugs that actually hurt them by the way i've told this story many times i saw it speaking
[02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:43.640]  of pbs years ago and then later i saw something similar when i was deer hunting a fawn came out
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:49.240]  it was older fawn didn't have spots anymore baby deer out into the field
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:55.720]  and the mother ran out and nudged it was trying to push it back she smelled danger
[02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:05.000]  obviously smelled me in there with a gun and it ran back out and she turned around and kicked
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:13.080]  but kind of missed and the deer came back out so i saw the deer bite bite it and by the way
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:19.000]  mammals spank down lowers you don't want to hurt the eyes it's an instant i mean monkeys do it apes
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:27.240]  do it dogs do it puppies with wolves are running out of the den and they think there's a predator
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.480]  out there you know mama wolf will you know grab them and growl at them and snap at them
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:37.560]  not because she wants to hurt them they they're not listening they have to learn
[02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:43.720]  through operative conditioning pavlovian conditioning that you get shocked you get bad stimulus
[02:38:43.720 --> 02:38:49.080]  when you do that you didn't listen to reason but but the video i saw which i've never seen
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:53.320]  again but probably they don't want people thinking about it did you guys ever find me that icebreaker
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:39:08.760]  story next come show it to me because i'm yeah what i want is a kit dangles everyone on this i
[02:39:08.760 --> 02:39:14.200]  want the cnn one because it was funny how they reported on it it's cnn and it's uh icebreak
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:18.840]  icebreaker ship stuck trying to wrestle people i want to mention that thanks anyways i'm getting
[02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:28.280]  back on the trends the news and your phone calls and i was watching the documentary about killer
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:34.840]  whales coming up to the arctic ice and eating fur seals and the seals need to go in and out of
[02:39:34.840 --> 02:39:41.480]  the water and they have breathing holes but killer whales will sit there waiting they can hold the
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:46.760]  breath for you know 30 minutes or whatever they're sitting there waiting for them and the mother will
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:52.040]  come over smell has a bad instinct you know picks up there's something down there says no we're not
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:57.560]  going in and the babies keep hopping over towards the edge of it and the first seal bark said it and
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:02.920]  hits it with its flippers and then did the exact same thing walked right over what i saw that deer do
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:10.440]  and bit and you could see on the film that there was a bloody spot now was it better for the seal
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:16.600]  to bite the baby to not get killed and eaten by killer whale and the establishment doesn't want
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:20.280]  you having your own kids they want your kids out of control so they're totally screwed up have no
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:25.320]  values and the state can take them over and then discipline them of themselves they want screwed
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:38.120]  up people and that's the same thing you know old fairy tales they would tell kids if you're bad
[02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:45.960]  you know a goblin will come and take you away at night so don't go outside of the house at night
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.360]  or the boogeyman will get you well the boogeyman was the fact in every ancient culture and still
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.840]  today there were crazy people and bad people that would go out at night and find people to rape and
[02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:01.160]  kill and so you didn't want to explain that to your kids you show them a picture of crumpets if
[02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:06.600]  you're bad st. Nicholas won't come and give you toys crumpets will come and take you to hell and
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:12.200]  that's why you'll wake up in your bed with coal because that's where you went in the night so
[02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:19.400]  they just combined it with Santa and let me tell you something I you know I told my wife this early
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:26.120]  on and she didn't want to do it and I respect her wishes but you tell your kids that's what
[02:41:26.120 --> 02:41:31.640]  fairy tells what they came up with it's art types of bad stuff happening hey you don't do what I say
[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:38.840]  a freddy kruger like person is going to come and get you and that's very effective because you
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:41.880]  know what if you don't do what your parents say and if you don't learn how things work if you don't
[02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:46.040]  learn the knowledge they know even if they're not perfect they do know more than you they have life
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:52.200]  experience there are stuff far worse than freddy kruger the fantasy character out there and that's
[02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:58.600]  all i'm trying to get to is this is 2014 the make it or break it time and there's a lot of other
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:03.640]  trends i'm going to try to do a focused trends analysis tonight that we can air tomorrow or
[02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:12.680]  perhaps on the nightly news but warm big midterm elections critical year we're going to see a
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:17.160]  continued martial law build up and i think the biggest thing you're going to see is the continued
[02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:22.840]  acceleration of the global depression in a siege system to consolidate globalist power and then to
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:28.120]  collectivize the entire globe with the globalist again offshore above the law exempt from all
[02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:33.960]  the taxes they create to transfer our wealth to them which they're also exempt from so the economic
[02:42:33.960 --> 02:42:39.880]  global warfare will intensify and the big news of 2012 is there is a global awakening happening
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:45.400]  but the globalists don't care they're moving forward with obama care with more false flags with
[02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:51.480]  the boston bombing the good news is the syria war fell apart their systems melting down but you will
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:55.560]  see more people who've believed in the system and keep believing if they follow the fads they're
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:01.000]  going to be fulfilled uh have mental breakdowns because this year i saw so many people i know
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.200]  literally believe they're going to become movie stars literally believe they're going to become
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:14.680]  dancing stars literally believe they're going to become rock and roll stars and music stars
[02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:20.280]  austin is like the new los angeles we're half the people i know are like no i'm going to be a movie
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:25.800]  star i'm going to be a music star and it's going to happen any minute and i know how rig the whole
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:29.800]  thing is and how it's designed to make you think you become successful because you're going to be a
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:34.760]  basketball star you're going to be a football star you're going to be a movie star and only a
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:40.040]  fraction of people that become a quote tv star or movie star even make the big money and then
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:44.840]  that's a prison itself only a fraction of the best basketball players even get in the mba it's like
[02:43:44.840 --> 02:43:51.000]  that'll be one out of ten million only a fraction it's just it's total delusions and i've seen this
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:58.040]  over the years learning psychology just living that most talk show host i ran into most liberty
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:02.840]  people didn't like authority and and care about freedom to a certain extent but really they thought
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:08.440]  this was their chance to be big stars and if they didn't become successful right away and if it was
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:15.000]  work in fighting tyranny or if there was any pressure fighting tyranny they just fall away or
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.200]  they start infighting and again folks do you think somebody tuning into a radio show that's
[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:24.840]  talking about this talk show this that that talk show that infighting do you think people
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:29.080]  tune into that or out of it they tune out because they don't know what they're talking about they
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.560]  don't care people care about themselves and what's happening right now they're looking for answers
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:38.520]  they're not looking for cast sunsteen's infighting so the feds will accelerate their attack on the
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:43.880]  alternative media and on the real media and internet censorship will intensify and as they
[02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:49.640]  said four years ago in the white house documents that are public by the white house regulations
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:55.160]  are cast sunstein they're going to fund fbi operatives that's the main group that does it
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:45:00.760]  deposes online talk show host believe me given platforms to create constant infighting howl
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:09.080]  turner style as you claim everyone is a fed but themselves and to create hoaxes in the media
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:15.880]  in hopes that other media picks up on the hoaxes so they can be discredited
[02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:22.760]  and you're going to see just massive intensification of that in 2014
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:28.840]  i want to go to your phone calls it's just that i'm sitting here brainstorming
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:33.640]  and thinking about what i really think is going to happen in 2014 even though they failed and
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:39.240]  midterm elections are coming up they're not going to give up they might if they stage another false
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:44.280]  flag and i really think that sandy hook has the earmarks we don't know exactly what happened
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:51.720]  but we know there was a stand down the aurora shooting is absolutely mind control 100% no debate
[02:45:51.720 --> 02:45:58.920]  sign still delivered shows the boston bombing we've already hashed over all that they could
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.400]  go with the nuke of a major city or a bio weapon release or they could shoot up a mall and kill
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:11.640]  200 people have a team go in lock down a mall systematically with a it'll be a foreign mercenary
[02:46:11.640 --> 02:46:14.840]  team it's just hard to get people that'll actually do that because they know whoever does that's
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:18.760]  going to be killed later but they do have some teams that that they may be able to get teams
[02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:25.320]  that'll do it and then they'll have guys tied up in a storage room three patriots three gun owners
[02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:31.160]  guys they've set up guys that they thought were joining a militia it'll be guys that think this
[02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:35.240]  is how they work i'm not saying this will happen this is a scenario it'll be guys that think they're
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:41.240]  joining a militia it'll be three vets four vets and they'll think they're going to meetings and for
[02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:49.080]  militia training in case america collapses to maintain order these guys will be people that
[02:46:49.080 --> 02:46:53.320]  don't have a lot of family so they can grab them drug them up for a few weeks to get them
[02:46:53.320 --> 02:46:57.800]  electro shocked and drugs let me know who they are just so they're confused and can't defend
[02:46:57.800 --> 02:47:05.480]  themselves they'll be kept after the brainwashing in a coma state until the day of the event and then
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:10.920]  at midnight they'll roll into the storage area at a front company in a mall or a business area they
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:17.320]  control it'll be about a five to ten man team that does it this is how they operate they'll
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:22.120]  have the guys drugged up the patsies they're going to drug and who they've drugged and who they're
[02:47:22.120 --> 02:47:28.040]  going to blame and then they'll go lock things down leave and have a drill in case they get caught
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:32.360]  to tell the cops it's part of a drill and if the cops get wise they'll just kill those cops and
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:36.520]  run the operation early and then they'll shoot a couple hundred people they need they want a big
[02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:42.200]  number and then it'll all be coincided with the guys wearing off from the drugs and then they'll
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:47.960]  have inside people inside the department they choose who will go in and shoot up and wound
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:52.520]  the guys that are drugged up so that'll be the cover in the hospital for why these guys can't
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.520]  talk and then in a couple days they'll come out of the drugs not knowing who they are that's how
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:02.920]  they run operations and that's how they did the boston bombing i mean those guys weren't drugged up
[02:48:02.920 --> 02:48:07.000]  they were cia guys that they thought were going to actually get to work for the agency who were

[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:24.280]  al-qaeda in syria at least publicly i mean your voice is out there your support of liberty your
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:30.360]  support of independent free speech is so essential they're gonna try to pass hate laws that ban
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:37.160]  speech that is quote offensive or hurtful to any group well you can find people out there that are
[02:54:37.160 --> 02:54:41.560]  are offended by anything and that's why you see the media putting this image out but you'll see
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:49.080]  the power of the kleptocratic media wane but with their target captured kept audience
[02:54:49.080 --> 02:54:54.040]  you'll see them get even more delusional i mean you can tell when somebody's a big tvhead
[02:54:55.320 --> 02:55:02.120]  i've got so many friends that uh end up yeah who have great marriages uh their marriages end
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:08.200]  as soon as their wife starts becoming a big television hit uh because you watch it it's
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:16.280]  scientific programming every word they say on sitcoms dramas uh soap operas movies is meant
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:21.800]  to shred the family is meant to put men down and is meant to have women just be total narcissistic
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:27.880]  arrogant self-serving creatures that care about nothing but their own you know personal power
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:34.760]  and being glamorous that's the new feminism is is is just being a tyrant and dominating
[02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:41.160]  your man not not working with them uh and it's just spreading everywhere and again men
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:47.240]  are buying into the image of men just being childlike moron pleasure seekers uh who just
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:53.880]  sit around gibbering mindlessly all day so you're seeing the effects of that uh in 2013 and 2014
[02:55:53.880 --> 02:56:02.120]  but you'll see a cnn msnbc continue to race bait uh continue to push balkanization
[02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:06.920]  you're just going to see the establishment throw total fits in what they're doing
[02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:11.720]  because they can't stop stealing and they can't stop their instinct to want to eradicate good
[02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:17.480]  it's not just they want to dominate they don't like goodness they've turned themselves over to it
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:26.600]  they're animated by it and so you're going to just see madness you're going to see mass mental illness
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:32.600]  and a pouring out of a spirit of evil in 2014 but you know what the bible says when the enemy
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:36.760]  comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord will lift up a standard against it so these
[02:56:36.760 --> 02:56:42.200]  are historic times and i don't want to hear from anybody that you're bored i don't want to hear from
[02:56:42.200 --> 02:56:48.920]  anybody uh that you know oh my gosh life so meaningless it's meaningless if you only care
[02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:57.640]  about substance of you know garbage of trappings of success the fake substance the fake material
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:01.400]  you've got to care about the real essence of freedom the engine of all that's good
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:07.880]  minus the fake substance of materialism now again they don't want you to have enough materialism so
[02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:13.240]  they can dangle it in front of you control you i want people to materially be satisfied you want
[02:57:13.240 --> 02:57:18.760]  that because then they can't be as easily controlled the problem is is that in this
[02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:29.320]  narcissistic decadent total materialistic society where that's worship there's never enough
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:36.680]  and that's where all the control freak manifestations come from as the people that have all the power
[02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:41.000]  are totally unhappy so if they could just dominate the world they might be happy
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:44.120]  or if they could just have the life decisions technologies but they can't with the general
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:47.640]  public habit you know they would be happy on and on and on i'm gonna do a little bit of overdrive
[02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:54.360]  because folks have been holding patiently nick and pennsylvania and then um ryan and james and
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:59.000]  nathan and rod i'll try to get to all of you and and to make your points we didn't have any guests
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:04.920]  today and i tend to run on at the mouth sometimes when i don't have guests it's kind of a intermission
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:10.760]  or rest from my ranting but i hope that this is spurred people to think about where we've been in
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:17.160]  2013 where we're going in 2014 and i'm not trying to give you gloom and doom we're in this situation
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:24.680]  it's the best of times worst of times but if we're honest about where we are as a civilization
[02:58:24.680 --> 02:58:31.320]  and as a society and admit that we're in peril we can get out of it it's like that icebreaker up
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:35.880]  there with the melted or down there in the melted arctic Antarctic you know down there in the global
[02:58:35.880 --> 02:58:40.760]  warming i mean it's stuck in the ice they have to admit they're stuck in the ice they have to admit

[03:02:02.760 --> 03:02:08.680]  being done through incrementalism it's getting people to think oh it's okay to spy on you we're
[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:14.760]  being protected no it's not okay the government does not have a right to put us under a microscope

[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:13.560]  didn't hear anybody touch on yet uh was actually the falsified nuclear attack down there in uh
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:18.920]  south carolina yeah that is the year they fired a bunch of nuke generals right after we were told
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:24.760]  by our high-level source that they transferred secret nukes uh out of uh dais air force base

[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:36.200]  here's a new american article that hits the nail on the head establishment terrified both republican
[03:10:36.200 --> 03:10:43.240]  and democrat tea party won't back unnecessary wars and it breaks down how the whole system's
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:48.920]  coming after but not 2014 is so key for getting good tea party people into office i mentioned
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:55.560]  this yesterday but i need to mention it again and then go to your calls the latest revelations are
[03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:03.000]  that when any public figure anybody wants to buy a computer via the mail or an iphone via the mail
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:08.280]  or whatever that the nsa has a whole assembly line system with apple with microsoft with all of them
[03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:13.880]  with the postal service with ups with fedex to where your package is intercepted routed to them
[03:11:13.880 --> 03:11:19.640]  and then without warrants they put the malware and spyware on it and then the fbi you know releases
[03:11:19.640 --> 03:11:24.520]  a worldwide malware to quote catch one guy so when he logged on to any computer in the world
[03:11:25.320 --> 03:11:30.360]  they could catch him does anyone believe that we've always told you the viruses are being
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:34.280]  created by the globalist they created stuxnet three years ago and i predicted they would say
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:38.440]  we've got to take internet freedom because of stuxnet even after it was admitted the us and
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:45.640]  israel made it we had to go up our rights because they made a virus we have to give up our rights
[03:11:45.640 --> 03:11:51.320]  because they're helping al qaeda i mean bull man enough is enough and all you new listeners out there
[03:11:51.320 --> 03:11:55.160]  that laugh at this stuff i know you're not laughing too much now we're going to lose everything if we
[03:11:55.160 --> 03:12:03.960]  don't get upset i mean drudge linked to my article or our article uh yesterday it's actually an rt
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:10.120]  article we posted where now the police are just having real checkpoints taking dna without warrants
[03:12:10.120 --> 03:12:14.440]  first it was federal funding where they asked voluntarily and intimidated you now they're
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:20.600]  just saying give it to me i'm just incredible there's another article targets close relationship
[03:12:20.600 --> 03:12:25.800]  to government needs to be watched targets forensic services is who the fbi secret service vatf and
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:31.400]  others have turned to for help for two decades yeah and the fbi crime lab folks is the most corrupt
[03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:37.640]  in the world uh was it dr frederick weirhurst we've interviewed him went public to head of the crime
[03:12:37.640 --> 03:12:41.960]  lab about the total fraud where they were framing almost everybody and all the other major police
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:49.000]  labs get caught framing i mean let me tell you the system you cannot believe a police officer
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:54.120]  when they testify or an fbi agent and i'm not seeing individually they they may be a crook
[03:12:55.400 --> 03:13:00.520]  i'm not saying individually i think they're all crooks i'm saying on the top they are a known
[03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:06.600]  criminal group any big police department any i mean every major police department in texas
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:12.600]  has had frame ups in their in their labs or they use groups that engage in frame ups target is a
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:17.960]  social engineering group if you go research them it's another globalist front like microsoft apple
[03:13:17.960 --> 03:13:24.840]  all of them the big boxes are meant to destroy the economy just to understand that walmart all of it
[03:13:24.840 --> 03:13:33.880]  so that's just some of the news let's uh go to here's one more from jd hayes at naturalnews.com
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:39.400]  up on info wars.com and this happened a few months ago but now it's back in the news the person had
[03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:44.760]  a glitter poster and the police said well we saw some of it falling we think you tried to
[03:13:44.760 --> 03:13:49.640]  hoax people as a bio weapon we're arresting you and charging you with it environmental activists
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:53.880]  like all activists can sometimes be overly disruptive and a little bit kooky in what they
[03:13:53.880 --> 03:13:58.920]  choose to protest but the only thing that generally are not our terrorist but apparently some political
[03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:05.640]  departments and federal law enforcement officials would beg to differ indeed according to mother
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:10.360]  jones magazine many activists have been subjected to arrest in the past but never for being enemies
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:15.400]  of the state until now it's not uncommon for environmental protesters to face arrest but
[03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:19.480]  here's the first apparent simmer 13th oklahoma city police charged a pair of environmental
[03:14:19.480 --> 03:14:24.040]  activists was staging a terrorism hoax when they unfurled a pair of banners covered with glitter
[03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:30.440]  a substance local cops considered evidence of a fake biological assault though they didn't say
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:35.880]  bio attack bio attack they just saw some glitter it's like saying you assaulted an officer with
[03:14:35.880 --> 03:14:41.080]  detergent because you blew bubbles at them that didn't even touch them this is the mental illness
[03:14:41.080 --> 03:14:48.600]  folks and again this is the big article uh chicago pension crisis called worst in the nation
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:52.360]  there's no amount of taxes are going to fix it it was designed to do this okay let's go to your
[03:14:52.360 --> 03:14:57.320]  calls just wanted to hit some more of that news and then we're going to play this rabble rouser
[03:14:57.320 --> 03:15:04.280]  club we have queued up uh let's go to james in kentucky james you're on the air hello sir i
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:09.160]  i have something of great importance i'd like to share with you that i discovered uh the other day
[03:15:09.160 --> 03:15:15.880]  um i discovered uh how to reclaim your sovereign citizenship and there's a link i would like to
[03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:21.000]  recommend that and and and i mean have you gone out and then the establishment then let you on
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:24.920]  airplanes without ids and suddenly you didn't have to pay taxes and stuff i mean i mean did you
[03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:31.720]  discover it or has it worked well no we've always had sovereign rights no no i know we have them but
[03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:38.040]  they've taken them by force to juror and and and and they're just dominating us through force of
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:45.880]  tyranny i agree they are but we you know if more people stand up in favor of this and understand what
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:51.720]  their rights really are then this country that would solve it may be all of our problems and
[03:15:51.720 --> 03:15:56.760]  and i'm really just kind of blown away the fact you don't stand up for these things you know but
[03:15:56.760 --> 03:16:02.520]  i do hear oh wait wait wait wait i don't stand up for these things uh and and and then you want to
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:08.360]  plug a website i don't mean that sir i don't mean you don't stand up for our rights i i mean i don't
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:14.040]  hear you say anything about how to reclaim our sovereign rights well i've had tons of guests
[03:16:14.040 --> 03:16:18.760]  on like red beckman and countless others over the years the problem is most of the people
[03:16:19.320 --> 03:16:23.320]  with the strawman arguments and all the rest of it i've been doing i've been doing this 18 years
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:27.880]  so i know all about it i'm not frustrated with you i'm not trying to belittle you
[03:16:27.880 --> 03:16:35.000]  you it's just that there is reality to it but the reality is educating people about it so
[03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:40.840]  we stop complying and realize our rights i'm saying there isn't some magic thing you do
[03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:47.720]  uh that that that then stops it all there's no silver bullet i'm always talking about silver
[03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:55.160]  bullets and so here's my deal though i don't usually screen calls i wanted to know what
[03:16:55.160 --> 03:16:59.320]  people thought the top stories of 2013 are so you're saying it's a sovereign movement i think
[03:16:59.320 --> 03:17:05.160]  moving to the country becoming a farmer buying locally uh not complying with unconstitutional
[03:17:05.160 --> 03:17:10.040]  laws getting out of the system fighting stuff in court learning the constitution bill of rights
[03:17:10.040 --> 03:17:14.040]  suing corrupt officials uh teaching them that they're public servants i mean there's a lot of
[03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:19.800]  real stuff i just don't promote sovereign citizen type stuff because it's minefields of people
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:24.760]  promoting stuff and saying stuff that gets people in trouble i mean it's like the irs is totally
[03:17:24.760 --> 03:17:33.000]  illegal run by the federal reserve set up a 1913 a total scam but if the average person gets out of
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:37.640]  it they will grab your bank accounts and shut you down and come after you now if we keep complying
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:41.800]  they're going to put the whole cashless society in and jack it up to where it's impossible to survive
[03:17:41.800 --> 03:17:46.200]  to make us destitute that's the plan so we almost have to stop paying it just to survive it's
[03:17:46.200 --> 03:17:52.760]  meant to destroy us i'm just saying make your own decision and watch out but if you're small
[03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:57.160]  time and aren't a big organization and are just taking care of your family there's 60 million
[03:17:57.160 --> 03:18:01.480]  people not paying it that's why they want the cashless society to come after you so i say bravo
[03:18:01.480 --> 03:18:05.640]  to those people out there but it's like the mafia i'm saying you make the decision whether you're
[03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:10.680]  going to pay them or not because they might break your legs let's go ahead and talk to rod in france
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:19.480]  go ahead rod how you doing alex good brother all my best wishes for a uh for a new year that
[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:25.640]  were nobody's too sure about but uh i don't know we need to stick together and hope things go go
[03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:31.160]  better i guess um i wanted to make a comment earlier in the show when you were talking about
[03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:37.160]  the radio controlled aircraft uh going back to war war two i wanted to let you know since i'm from
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:42.040]  catering ohio originally living in france now i wanted to let you know that charles catering
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:48.200]  back in 1917 was commissioned by the united states army to make the first radio controlled flying
[03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:53.880]  bomb which was called the catering bug which i guess was the world's first drone a little bit
[03:18:53.880 --> 03:18:57.640]  of trivia there for you yeah but people think they couldn't remote control the jet aircraft
[03:18:57.640 --> 03:19:02.840]  from 9 11 those were the first large passenger liners fitted with systems for remote control
[03:19:03.800 --> 03:19:11.480]  exactly and i mean for me it's it's just common knowledge but i guess it depends on i don't know
[03:19:11.480 --> 03:19:16.840]  no no no you get it when you're informed you're a conspiracy theorist you're a rabble rouser let's
[03:19:16.840 --> 03:19:20.280]  skip this network break so i have time to go to people i'm gonna go to the bottom of the hour then
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:25.080]  we've got a key work to get done finish in the studio here with the great crew but no i know when
[03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:30.760]  you're informed the the dumbed down people have been taught that to laugh at you and that makes
[03:19:30.760 --> 03:19:35.560]  them better than you they think because you're trying to inform them you're showing off to them
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:42.920]  that's how pathetic some of the general public are clearly and it's and it's irritating it's
[03:19:42.920 --> 03:19:48.040]  irritating and it gets your blood up but you know you just kind of deal with it because
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:52.280]  you know you just have to realize that these people aren't informed and they're spending their time
[03:19:52.280 --> 03:19:56.520]  probably watching soap operas or well no that's it and i mean here's the deal of the sheeple you

[03:20:19.560 --> 03:20:24.360]  and it's just look it's all going to collapse the globalists know the system's unsustainable
[03:20:24.360 --> 03:20:29.800]  so they've made it even more unsustainable so they can control the collapse and gain power in a
[03:20:29.800 --> 03:20:35.080]  judo move out of the unsustainability of the system while they blocked all the new technologies
[03:20:35.080 --> 03:20:42.920]  and systems and made us unsustainable we have go ahead exactly and the thing about it is is i'm
[03:20:42.920 --> 03:20:47.320]  well you're an expert at this uh you're going to get it all thrown back in your face people
[03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:52.360]  are going to laugh at you or be little you or do whatever it is that they that they're going to do
[03:20:52.360 --> 03:20:56.680]  but you know you just have to do your best to try to try to get them to understand oh listen
[03:20:56.680 --> 03:21:00.920]  listen i saw a clip and i appreciate your call i gotta jump into others finish your point sorry go
[03:21:00.920 --> 03:21:08.120]  ahead well i've anyway for for uh 2013 real real quickly i wanted to say for me uh the the biggest
[03:21:08.120 --> 03:21:16.120]  things that happened in 2013 the biggest thing was the blatant open disregard for uh rule of law
[03:21:16.120 --> 03:21:23.960]  at the same time as the the police state grows with with virtually totally total impunity and uh
[03:21:23.960 --> 03:21:31.960]  you know a lot of this i think you know uh open any constitutional lawmaking uh by obama uh is just
[03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:37.560]  incredible for me and and what i think is why why things have anything nothing has happened against
[03:21:37.560 --> 03:21:44.200]  this i i'm starting to believe especially after the comments of mr benny on your show uh the other
[03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:51.320]  day i think that the nsa has criminal maybe or or immoral information on politicians and maybe
[03:21:51.320 --> 03:21:57.160]  forcing them to do uh what they say or be exposed or lose their job absolutely look we already know
[03:21:57.160 --> 03:22:02.760]  this is in england and here remember every couple years you hear about like 5000 pentagon computers
[03:22:02.760 --> 03:22:06.440]  had child born on them and then they go in and say this is on your computer you're like i didn't
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:11.080]  put that there they're like well do what we say they're putting it there they can go and create
[03:22:11.080 --> 03:22:16.120]  fake search histories they can go in as if they're you go wherever they want they can fake dna they
[03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:21.640]  can fake fingerprints they can fake biometrics all of it it's all on record and and that's what
[03:22:21.640 --> 03:22:28.040]  target does that's what i mean it's so crazy i appreciate your call god bless you it is just
[03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:35.160]  totally disgusting to uh see all of this going on it's just all fake no and that's it they have
[03:22:35.160 --> 03:22:39.720]  created criminal divisions in all these governments and major corporations and now they're busy getting
[03:22:39.720 --> 03:22:47.720]  rid of the old non-criminal divisions and converting to pure criminality and uh people need to understand
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:53.320]  who did all this it's the people that work for the system and they think it's funny and they're
[03:22:53.320 --> 03:22:58.600]  they're setting up a police state because that's a rearguard action to protect them in case we try
[03:22:58.600 --> 03:23:03.400]  to stop them so the number one mission is to get the word out about who did it so this is the year
[03:23:03.400 --> 03:23:08.200]  that the rule of law was openly urinated all over and killed so of course there's an awakening the
[03:23:08.200 --> 03:23:12.520]  question is is it happening is it happening fast enough nathan in california you're on the air
[03:23:14.200 --> 03:23:19.400]  hey alex are you good brother what's on your mind uh so real quick i was hoping to pitch
[03:23:19.960 --> 03:23:25.080]  one of your products real quick just to let the whole world know that uh supermail vitality
[03:23:25.080 --> 03:23:32.440]  is the bee's knees turns you into a rock star but uh on top of that i'd like to talk about how
[03:23:32.440 --> 03:23:38.760]  the united states is shipping guns over to syria to fight al-qaeda when i was over in iraq fighting
[03:23:39.480 --> 03:23:46.920]  to kill like just take out al-qaeda like it it angers me the fact that now i'm considered a terrorist
[03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:54.520]  because of my views yet they're still giving guns to the people who were sent over to fight
[03:23:56.600 --> 03:24:01.320]  you know i totally agree with you and and but it's it's the thing of this the insult
[03:24:01.320 --> 03:24:06.040]  that they openly are funding al-qaeda and openly gave them the weapons that been gauzy and then
[03:24:06.040 --> 03:24:12.280]  let them kill the ambassador and and those navy seal people uh well the sheep dip navy seals uh
[03:24:12.280 --> 03:24:19.880]  cia seals showed that they could cover the whole deal up and and it just shows how incredibly arrogant
[03:24:19.880 --> 03:24:25.480]  they are and i'm just sick of it and i know the veterans out there now you're the new threat
[03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:30.280]  and you just know they're going to fall flag and blame it on vets do you think vets are going to
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:34.840]  buy that do you think the military is going to buy taking over america to go after vets
[03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:41.000]  oh so i mean i've talked to a lot of my friends who are still in the military and i got friends
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:46.200]  over in iraq and at the end stand right now and they're sick of it you know we're getting sent
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:52.520]  over there to fight al-qaeda and yet we're we're fighting the people with our guns and we're paying
[03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:57.080]  for it but again if you're mega banks playing both sides you get money and power out of that
[03:24:57.080 --> 03:25:01.880]  people go why would america fund al-qaeda and then they kill our troops that's how you have a war
[03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:06.920]  it's how you destabilize iraq it's how you destabilize afghanistan the goal is to screw stuff up
[03:25:08.680 --> 03:25:14.120]  i mean it's it's and the globalists admit that that's their program god bless you sorry one more
[03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:18.840]  point go ahead oh and everybody wants to stay like oh well obama's doing such great things
[03:25:18.840 --> 03:25:23.880]  well he's the one who's just extended that afghan war for another 10 years how many how
[03:25:23.880 --> 03:25:28.040]  many more people need to go over there and get butchered i was a corpsman like a medic
[03:25:28.680 --> 03:25:35.080]  i've seen what happens over there and these people are coming back main killed just so some
[03:25:35.080 --> 03:25:39.880]  other person can make a ton of money and we need to like as a country stand up and say enough is
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:43.720]  enough yes and the only group look who are they demonizing god bless you and i appreciate you
[03:25:43.720 --> 03:25:48.440]  sir and even though the war was a fraud your courage is still recognized you believe you were
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:53.240]  fighting for liberty and freedom so you're not guilty and you could still be honored
[03:25:53.240 --> 03:25:57.800]  on people to understand that god judges the heart folks because the world is so sophisticated
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:02.200]  and it's only in hindsight that we learn the truth and then now could say it was wrong i mean i
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:07.080]  was always against it but walter jones who was for it has apologized to everyone and has tried to end
[03:26:07.080 --> 03:26:13.160]  it and that's really the essence of being manly is when you're wrong admitting it and then setting
[03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:17.480]  about to try to rectify it i mean if you've been involved in abortions you don't want to admit it
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:20.920]  was wrong because you don't want to admit you're wrong deep down you know it was a bad decision
[03:26:20.920 --> 03:26:26.440]  and you didn't understand all of it at the time but just admit you're wrong now and try to end the
[03:26:26.440 --> 03:26:36.600]  practice certainly ended for the third trimester and i'm telling you it's like the christmas story
[03:26:39.880 --> 03:26:46.760]  where you've got the you know the bankers that have all the chains on them all the evil they've
[03:26:46.760 --> 03:26:54.920]  done and they tell us scrooge that his chains are twice that size and he better start working to get
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:27:00.280]  them off i mean that's real folks spiritually that's basically what it is and i know the bible
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:06.440]  people debate it back and forth you know faith faith without works is dead we are saved by by faith
[03:27:06.440 --> 03:27:14.200]  and by grace but if you're not really saved then you won't recognize evil and not want to be part of
[03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:22.440]  it and you won't want to resist it and you won't have works i mean people out there are these churches
[03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:28.200]  that just go and feel good all day and sit on their butts and do nothing while all this evil is
[03:27:28.200 --> 03:27:32.680]  going on and your church is really a 501c3 government institution you're not in a church
[03:27:34.760 --> 03:27:41.640]  and the church is really many of these establishment litterbug churches are really
[03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:46.520]  the government spies sitting up there watching everything you're doing and they're going to
[03:27:46.520 --> 03:27:51.080]  tell you turn your guns in take the inoculations do what you're told when they drop the hammer
[03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:56.200]  just like in red dawn when the soviets take over with the latin american invasion
[03:27:57.320 --> 03:28:01.800]  it's very accurate the way it portrays they go and they've got the mayor and the preachers working
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:09.480]  for them and reporting to them who is involved and who they think will resist to then get them
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:15.800]  involved in the evil so now they're part of it that's how corruption works folks and i'm telling
[03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:25.000]  you right now better decide which side you're on you better decide right now because i've never
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:33.160]  had more dread than i have now and i am just lost in a wilderness of being overwhelmed and i know
[03:28:33.160 --> 03:28:38.200]  you're overwhelmed too is we just got to get our hearts right and we just got to leave these big
[03:28:38.200 --> 03:28:42.600]  litterbug churches or shake them up go in there and say why aren't you talking about this one
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:46.760]  about that i've just a bunch of people that see the world falling apart who want to feel good and
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:51.960]  feel like they go one day a week to watch some glitterbug preacher on a big screen sit there
[03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:56.040]  and act like he's got the moral authority and he's the father and he's the leader but then the
[03:28:56.040 --> 03:29:00.840]  wife sits there and you know and these women sit there and are the bosses of their husbands
[03:29:00.840 --> 03:29:07.880]  i mean i mean these churches are evil ladies and gentlemen these churches now because i i watch
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:14.440]  them on television i read their doctrines i've been to them and man it is um it's all government run
[03:29:15.800 --> 03:29:21.080]  almost all these churches are government run now and uh these preachers know who they are
[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:27.000]  i've even run to baptist preachers at funerals and stuff who are good people overall but they
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:30.760]  come over and they try to tell me i'm wrong about stuff but they have this look in their eyes like
[03:29:30.760 --> 03:29:36.200]  they're scared they're upset they're convicted just seeing me i could see everything written
[03:29:36.200 --> 03:29:41.320]  in their face because they know they know god knows they're a coward and i'm telling you the fact
[03:29:41.320 --> 03:30:03.240]  that you know that i know what christ is going to say at that white throne about you doesn't know you
