[00:00.000 --> 00:11.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.320 --> 00:18.880]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.880 --> 00:22.840]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.320 --> 00:29.600]  well we're already into week number two broadcast week number two into the new
[00:29.600 --> 00:37.920]  year 2010 it is Monday the 11th day of January 2010 we're gonna be live here for
[00:37.920 --> 00:43.640]  the next four hours as we are every weekday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central that's
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.640]  12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern now I do have some guests coming up towards the end of
[00:48.640 --> 00:58.040]  the show today on Banker gate or Bankster gate as I am dubbing it but I want to
[00:58.040 --> 01:05.080]  out of the gates open the show up but I'm specifically telling listeners I am
[01:05.080 --> 01:11.640]  specifically telling listeners that I in the first hour want to talk about one
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.120]  of three things because I want to try to put the focus on these three things to
[01:16.120 --> 01:22.520]  get a grassroots salvo launched now we did this together with many other
[01:22.520 --> 01:26.720]  patriots and freedom lovers and justice lovers with Copenhagen and
[01:26.720 --> 01:34.760]  torpedoed that key global governance summit and we torpedoed their swine flu
[01:34.760 --> 01:38.840]  hype it is now all over the mainstream media the last two weeks that record
[01:38.840 --> 01:43.080]  numbers of people refused to take the vaccine the government tried to force
[01:43.080 --> 01:48.560]  it in several test states that blew up in their face legally that fell apart and
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.080]  I've been meaning to cover those stories I've been so focused on the government
[01:52.080 --> 01:57.240]  takeover of health care on the naked body scanners going in that now is in
[01:57.240 --> 02:04.440]  trouble but if we keep pressing we will defeat it there are so many things that
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.920]  if we focus on them together it can cause a chain reaction in the alternative
[02:09.920 --> 02:16.720]  media that breaks into the mainstream media and when we focus on something
[02:16.720 --> 02:28.600]  we're able to gather to really knock a dent in the new world order skull so I
[02:28.600 --> 02:35.560]  want to try to focus on three subjects the big one that we need to get rolling
[02:35.560 --> 02:40.280]  is Bankster gate that's what I'm calling it some are calling it Timmy gate with
[02:40.280 --> 02:43.800]  Tim Geithner but he's only one of the crooks involved in all of this
[02:43.800 --> 02:49.440]  activity I want to go over the latest developments with Bankster gate for those
[02:49.440 --> 02:53.040]  that don't know what's going on this broke last Thursday Friday and
[02:53.040 --> 02:57.000]  throughout the weekend and then I want to open the phones up on Bankster gate on
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.200]  the government takeover of health care that's destroying the Democratic Party
[03:01.200 --> 03:05.480]  in front of everyone's eyes because they're bought and paid for it doesn't
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.560]  matter if almost all of their constituents on the right and left or
[03:09.560 --> 03:13.040]  against it they've been bought and paid for they're going ahead with it that's
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.440]  in conference committee could go out to the president's desk any day so again
[03:17.440 --> 03:23.400]  the takeover of health care Bankster gate and the naked body scanners we need to
[03:23.400 --> 03:29.360]  focus on all three of those issues and more and more coming to the forum we
[03:29.360 --> 03:33.520]  have the situation unfolding and developing and percolating with attacks
[03:33.520 --> 03:43.960]  on Iran expanded war in Afghanistan Pakistan Sudan Somalia and of course in Yemen
[03:43.960 --> 03:48.560]  so you're welcome to call in about that subject but but those aren't the subjects
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.760]  Bankster gate government takeover of health care naked body scanners and the
[03:53.760 --> 04:00.600]  Empire's wish to start new wars we're at least going to talk about that in the
[04:00.600 --> 04:04.800]  first and second hour because we need to focus on this we need to brainstorm
[04:04.800 --> 04:10.760]  about it we need to talk about criminal charges from the grand jury level at the
[04:10.760 --> 04:15.120]  state level you know the feds won't go after these bankers because they're in
[04:15.120 --> 04:20.000]  the hip pocket of them we can have the state grand juries do it governor
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.600]  Elliott Spitzer a year and a half ago said he was going to go after the bankers
[04:24.600 --> 04:29.120]  and pointed out the fraud at AIG and you notice he was under full FBI
[04:29.120 --> 04:33.760]  surveillance anybody with powers under full FBI surveillance and they knew
[04:33.760 --> 04:40.720]  about his pension for hot hookers and they torpedoed him quick they know the
[04:40.720 --> 04:45.280]  power of the state going after these people at the state level that was a
[04:45.280 --> 04:49.160]  warning shot to anybody that tries to go after these crooks that are squatting
[04:49.160 --> 04:54.320]  on top the Republic literally drinking up its last pints of blood either we
[04:54.320 --> 05:00.560]  stop the bankers or we go into total enslavement stay with us this is Alex

[07:59.480 --> 08:23.920]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:23.920 --> 08:30.080]  I told the listeners of this radio broadcast that in the new year we were
[08:30.080 --> 08:34.840]  going to make some changes here on the radio show namely when I do open the
[08:34.840 --> 08:40.480]  phones up I am going to not attempt I am going to succeed in actually taking
[08:40.480 --> 08:47.280]  your phone calls and yesterday I took 36 phone calls in my two hour
[08:47.280 --> 08:53.520]  abbreviated Sunday broadcast and today I want to take no less than at least 50
[08:53.520 --> 09:01.160]  now we do have Wayne Madsen joining us on a host of breaking investigative
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.680]  journalism coups that he has successfully carried out in the last month
[09:07.680 --> 09:12.600]  and of course among that we'll also get his take on Tim Geithner gate a summer
[09:12.600 --> 09:18.480]  calling it I'm calling it Bankster gate we can't just focus in on Timmy
[09:18.480 --> 09:24.040]  Geithner and his clear criminal activity and we've seen Ed Schultz saying looks
[09:24.040 --> 09:34.360]  like the White House is in trouble on this we've seen Judge Napolitano come
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.240]  out and say that this clearly looks like it is criminal and the reason that's
[09:40.240 --> 09:46.200]  important is when you have both Fox and MSNBC on multiple reports I've seen and
[09:46.200 --> 09:49.920]  I'm not even paying attention coming out and telling the truth about this it
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.280]  means that the bankers are in trouble they are the New World Order they are
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.360]  the real government they are the people who fund all the phony environmentalist
[09:59.360 --> 10:05.720]  movements because they want to seize our land and property in receivership they
[10:05.720 --> 10:09.600]  are the folks funding the establishment of a private world government and the
[10:09.600 --> 10:15.320]  carbon tax they are the people that run Northcom and Homeland Security they are
[10:15.320 --> 10:20.640]  the people turning the Western world into a high-tech police state grid so
[10:20.640 --> 10:25.080]  that they can carry out their criminal activities successfully and not end up
[10:25.080 --> 10:30.960]  going to prison for it they've passed the point of no return in October of 2008
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.200]  they are going for broke either they win and completely dominate us and bankrupt
[10:37.200 --> 10:44.880]  us so badly that we're like North Koreans are Mexicans so poor so destitute
[10:44.880 --> 10:49.000]  that everybody basically goes on welfare and under the control of the state and
[10:49.000 --> 10:54.240]  we're systemic corruption and the kleptocracy of government becomes the
[10:54.240 --> 10:59.840]  norm America is in a flux period right now the globalist are trying to form
[10:59.840 --> 11:05.360]  the world into their image of corruption and tyranny they're very strong during
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.640]  this period but they're also very weak during this period because they have
[11:09.640 --> 11:14.720]  revealed themselves they have shown the planet who they are and what they are for
[11:14.720 --> 11:20.200]  those that don't know what banker gate is it's old news to this audience but new
[11:20.200 --> 11:26.160]  news to the world the Obama deception with precision names the criminals in
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.560]  the exact crimes committed these are not secrets fall of the republic in two
[11:32.560 --> 11:39.400]  hours and 24 minutes details part two of that saga with absolute total
[11:39.400 --> 11:45.600]  precision and I'd love to toot my horn but it's not hard the crimes are out in
[11:45.600 --> 11:48.800]  the open it's like someone murdering their wife on their front lawn with a
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.320]  shotgun with a hundred neighbors watching there's no debating what happened
[11:53.320 --> 11:58.600]  here there's no there's no discussion of what happened here it's like the mad
[11:58.600 --> 12:04.040]  shooter on the ut tower hundreds of witnesses that he was the guy up there
[12:04.040 --> 12:10.280]  doing the shooting millions of witnesses the paper trail it's on the record what
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.560]  the private Federal Reserve has done and what its private counterparts in
[12:14.560 --> 12:21.520]  Europe and the rest of the world have done so coming up at the start of the
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.520]  next hour I'm going to break down all the facets all the details of Bankster
[12:26.520 --> 12:33.320]  gate I'm calling it Bankster gate if we allow the media to call it Timmy gate or
[12:33.320 --> 12:38.160]  Geithner gate as it's now being called that will limit it to Tim Geithner and
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.600]  then they'll just have him step down I would guess sometime before the mid-term
[12:43.600 --> 12:51.520]  elections coming up in the next eight months nine ten months so we need to
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.280]  identify that he is only one of the technicians one of the bag men engaged
[12:56.280 --> 13:01.080]  in this yes he was the head of the New York Fed yes it's on record that he
[13:01.080 --> 13:08.600]  ordered the New York Fed lawyers to tell AIG and other recipients of the
[13:08.600 --> 13:14.480]  trillions of dollars to not tell the public who they were giving the money
[13:14.480 --> 13:20.280]  to again from the start and in the Obama deception and in fall the Republic we
[13:20.280 --> 13:26.200]  point out AIG and the 200 plus billion it got alone and the 50 billion to four
[13:26.200 --> 13:32.520]  European banks and the list goes on and on that it wasn't even about the CEOs
[13:32.520 --> 13:38.120]  getting bonuses the media only focused on that it was about the shareholders and
[13:38.120 --> 13:44.720]  about the other brokers and bankers and it was about the companies that AIG and
[13:44.720 --> 13:51.560]  other holding companies paid out to AIG was the holding company for the biggest
[13:51.560 --> 13:58.680]  payout of bonus money it was the front that they said was insolvent so that it
[13:58.680 --> 14:03.440]  could then pay out the money to Timmy Geithner and to Henry Paulson and
[14:03.440 --> 14:11.120]  others you want to talk about criminality we have Geithner we have
[14:11.120 --> 14:15.880]  been Bernacke we have Henry Paulson we have them all testifying before
[14:15.880 --> 14:22.720]  Congress over and over and over again in the ethics committee in the house
[14:22.720 --> 14:29.920]  banking committee in the Senate banking committee over and over and over and we
[14:29.920 --> 14:37.000]  have the boil downs of that in both my films on this and all they did was come
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.080]  up and say we're not going to tell you where the trillions are and all these
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.000]  different congressmen Grayson and others by the way let's get Grayson back on
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.760]  Grayson Paul Stern the list goes on and on
[14:56.760 --> 15:08.360]  Senator Sanders they all said where is the money where is the money and who
[15:08.360 --> 15:19.000]  did you give the money to and they all said I won't tell you I won't tell you
[15:19.000 --> 15:26.240]  I won't tell you in fact we need to get some of those clips out of the films and
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.360]  play them on air today there's just so much corruption it's like putting on a
[15:29.360 --> 15:33.440]  court case every day here there's so much evidence I mean how do you expose it
[15:33.440 --> 15:36.080]  all but you've all heard the clips you've all seen it it's been on the news as
[15:36.080 --> 15:43.360]  well we'll play some of those coming up later saying over and over again we
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.240]  won't tell you now why is that important we have Timmy Geithner we have Ben
[15:48.240 --> 15:54.600]  Bernanke we have Paulson we have summers we have Ruben we have Greenspan all of
[15:54.600 --> 15:59.760]  these culprits involved in the crime together over the last 20 years all
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.920]  saying over and over again on record we will not tell the public where the money
[16:03.920 --> 16:07.800]  went and we have them in testimony saying they've ordered the banks and
[16:07.800 --> 16:13.920]  regulatory agencies not to tell people then Bloomberg kind of startled them
[16:13.920 --> 16:17.400]  caught them got them into a line normally they just stonewall and say
[16:17.400 --> 16:22.320]  it's their right to do it which obviously it's illegal out in the open but
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.520]  they just gone about their business like a thief robbing that your television set
[16:26.520 --> 16:29.200]  and jewelry right in front of you and you pull up at your house and they're
[16:29.200 --> 16:33.040]  walking out with big screen TVs in there in their hands and you say what are you
[16:33.040 --> 16:36.080]  doing robbing me and they said oh this is the wrong house we were called here
[16:36.080 --> 16:40.280]  we're movers and then you run into the house to see what's missing and when you
[16:40.280 --> 16:47.840]  come out they're gone but Bloomberg came out Thursday with the headline that
[16:47.840 --> 16:57.160]  Tim Geithner's New York Fed ordered AIG to not release the information to the
[16:57.160 --> 17:01.160]  federal government or the public or to other agencies of who was being paid
[17:01.160 --> 17:08.880]  the money and namely Goldman Sachs and so for the last year and a half they've
[17:08.880 --> 17:12.680]  been saying we won't tell you where the money went over and over and over again
[17:12.680 --> 17:17.240]  and then now the White House got startled Gibbs on Friday we're gonna play
[17:17.240 --> 17:22.920]  this clip coming up later the White House got startled into openly lying and
[17:22.920 --> 17:29.720]  saying no Tim Geithner never knew about these emails from his New York Fed that
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.040]  he headed up the Newark Fed is the only federal power it calls all the shots
[17:33.040 --> 17:41.560]  administratively he never told or had no knowledge of AIG being told not to say
[17:41.560 --> 17:46.760]  where the bonuses went when he's on record in all these House and Senate
[17:46.760 --> 17:52.000]  testimony hearings admitting he told him not to he is caught red-handed in
[17:52.000 --> 17:59.200]  perjury before the House and Senate now that's the headlines I need from info
[17:59.200 --> 18:04.240]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com and info wars.net and I've asked Kurt Nemo and
[18:04.240 --> 18:07.560]  I've asked Steve Watson I've asked Paul Watson and I've asked Aaron Dykes who
[18:07.560 --> 18:12.640]  are the greatest guys on the planet they work around the clock I've asked them in
[18:12.640 --> 18:16.440]  notes I've sent them to put together the articles along this line because this is
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.360]  the line that nobody else is pointing out we have these people dead to rights we
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.200]  have them dead in our sights we're fully loaded like a hundred submarines lined
[18:26.200 --> 18:31.280]  up with torpedoes in the chute we've got the enemy aircraft carrier a thousand
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.040]  yards away from us flood those torpedoes shoots and fire weapons now I've been
[18:36.040 --> 18:43.600]  screaming fire weapons since Friday and I know all the other talk show hosts and

[18:47.120 --> 18:55.000]  and how to sink these people fire weapons fire what are we waiting for fire he
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.200]  needs to be indicted right now for perjury all of them need to be we could
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.880]  bring these people down right now they're not invincible but the police the
[19:03.880 --> 19:08.120]  military the juries the grand juries everybody just stands around afraid to

[19:17.040 --> 19:22.760]  on the news right now but if they have to they'll make stuff up they're trying
[19:22.760 --> 19:26.200]  to go after Ron Paul calling him an anti-semite trying to shut him down
[19:26.200 --> 19:29.480]  exposing these people but they've got a problem now there's too many people
[19:29.480 --> 19:33.320]  telling the truth there's too many people that see what's going on out in the
[19:33.320 --> 19:38.280]  open now we literally have got our guns trained on these people and nobody's
[19:38.280 --> 19:43.400]  opening fire well I'm opening fire in the info war right now don't wait for

[21:19.400 --> 21:23.640]  for your retirement the truth be told gold and silver is outperform paper
[21:23.640 --> 21:29.400]  investments like stocks bonds and CDs yet no word about IRAs perhaps the
[21:29.400 --> 21:33.400]  financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in

[22:10.200 --> 22:13.720]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[22:13.720 --> 22:18.640]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[22:18.640 --> 22:23.400]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[22:27.760 --> 22:33.040]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[22:37.360 --> 22:40.840]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[22:40.840 --> 22:46.080]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we

[24:38.960 --> 24:48.080]  right now mark in Florida you're on the air go ahead hello yes yes hello hi this
[24:48.080 --> 24:54.120]  is mark in Florida how are you doing fine go ahead Alex this is not this is a
[24:54.120 --> 25:01.040]  bit off the subject I've developed or invented a program that allows that
[25:01.040 --> 25:05.360]  encrypts email messages mark I gotta let you go I gotta let you go you know I
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.080]  specifically at the start of the show said four subjects people I want people
[25:10.080 --> 25:15.360]  to call in about mainly Bankster gate I mean almost every other day of the year
[25:15.360 --> 25:20.440]  it's wide open phones whatever you want but I say self-govern yourselves I want
[25:20.440 --> 25:23.800]  to talk about Bankster gate and what you think should be done to these bankers
[25:23.800 --> 25:29.520]  robbing us blind and we have no future if we don't stop these people now or I
[25:29.520 --> 25:33.320]  said the government takeover of health care or the naked body scanners or how
[25:33.320 --> 25:37.480]  they're gearing up for all these new wars I specifically said only on those
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.200]  subjects mark Frank in New York Frank you're on the air good afternoon Alex I
[25:42.200 --> 25:47.440]  wanted to discuss briefly the geopolitics of Yemen which will be our newest
[25:47.440 --> 25:53.400]  theater of Babel I would assume under Obama yes and it's on subject go ahead
[25:53.400 --> 26:04.840]  Yemen is primarily viewed by the United States as dominated by China and Russia
[26:04.840 --> 26:10.960]  in the economies as well as with military hardware and that's why Africa is
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.320]  moving into Africa to block that as well correct and also the fact that for the
[26:15.320 --> 26:21.840]  last thirty years South Yemen with the only communist state you know in the
[26:21.840 --> 26:28.000]  Arabic world what's very interesting is the fact that the U.S. is planned to put
[26:28.000 --> 26:34.880]  missile batteries in Yemen to protect Saudi Arabia and also to project power
[26:34.880 --> 26:42.120]  against India and Pakistan you'll recall that in 2000 when the coal was bombed
[26:42.120 --> 26:49.840]  with a shaped a shaped charge at the port of Aden yes attributed to Al Qaeda the
[26:49.840 --> 26:54.440]  technology for the complexity of that shaped charge could have only been
[26:54.440 --> 27:00.360]  produced by the United States Russia and Israel and what's very interesting about
[27:00.360 --> 27:05.840]  that that sort of set the model of Al Qaeda in play primarily we know that
[27:05.840 --> 27:11.360]  Al Qaeda was created by the CIA when it was conducting its covert war against
[27:11.360 --> 27:17.400]  the Soviets in Afghanistan 1981 through a 1990 and you'll notice that milk
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.000]  Bearden talks about that in his two books who ran the covert operations for
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.720]  the CIA in that theater of operation what I wanted to say about Yemen also is
[27:26.720 --> 27:32.760]  the fact that the United States really can't the CIA the army they really can't
[27:32.760 --> 27:40.440]  speak the language primarily Yemen has 15 different languages the most highly
[27:40.440 --> 27:46.520]  vulcanized and before I forget I want to throw this in the head of the
[27:46.520 --> 27:53.680]  operations over there was on CNN Friday and General Petraeus was saying that we
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.240]  don't have any troops in Yemen and we don't plan to ground offensive I've got
[27:57.240 --> 28:00.320]  the New York Times reporting that thousands of U.S. operatives and
[28:00.320 --> 28:04.520]  intelligence operatives and special forces have been there in the last year
[28:04.520 --> 28:09.880]  training these the Saudi backed group and so again just more ball-faced lies
[28:09.880 --> 28:14.960]  from sent come correct and also also some of the languages would be Yemeni
[28:14.960 --> 28:22.640]  Arabic Tabisi Abini Arabic Sequoia language the Sinani Arabic and what's
[28:22.640 --> 28:26.480]  very interesting there's only one country with the Western orientation that
[28:26.480 --> 28:30.560]  can actually that actually has a language proficiency in these different
[28:30.560 --> 28:34.360]  dialects and that would be Israel and the United States would most likely
[28:34.360 --> 28:42.160]  hire Israeli contractors to come in and sort of maintain the missile batteries
[28:42.160 --> 28:46.440]  but we know Israel the United States and Britain are all running around inside
[28:46.440 --> 28:50.640]  Yemen right now and the point is the Yemeni government is very concerned
[28:50.640 --> 28:55.560]  about this because they fear for their sovereignty and also we I try to be the
[28:55.560 --> 28:58.560]  head of the Yemeni's government has said that this underwear bomber thing is
[28:58.560 --> 29:03.320]  all overblown and the terrorism in Yemen is all overblown correct and what
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.960]  else is very interesting about Yemen is that it's rich in natural gas and also
[29:07.960 --> 29:15.040]  undeveloped oil so that sort of sets the agenda for the predatory capitalism of
[29:15.040 --> 29:20.440]  the endless war which seems to be where our multinational direction is
[29:20.440 --> 29:26.560]  geopolitically now well said I'm out of time Frank all right come back and go
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.200]  to Josh Mike Julio Christopher and many others again I would hope that listeners
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.400]  that want to talk about Bankstergate I mean this is a major naked patch on the
[29:37.400 --> 29:43.040]  belly of the dragon and if we concentrate on that we can discredit the
[29:43.040 --> 29:47.000]  private Federal Reserve and point out that it's the wellspring of most of our
[29:47.000 --> 29:55.280]  sorrows we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[29:55.280 --> 30:02.400]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:02.400 --> 30:06.840]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[30:06.840 --> 30:10.880]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:10.880 --> 30:14.280]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[30:14.280 --> 30:18.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:18.800 --> 30:23.360]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:23.360 --> 30:27.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.400 --> 30:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:31.200 --> 30:34.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[30:34.800 --> 30:39.120]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:39.120 --> 30:42.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[30:42.240 --> 30:45.960]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[31:09.680 --> 31:13.720]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[31:13.720 --> 31:19.440]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[31:19.440 --> 31:24.680]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[31:24.680 --> 31:28.680]  attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[31:28.680 --> 31:33.880]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[37:01.720 --> 37:08.360]  for obama when he came out to california from 2004 2006 and everything he told me was an outright
[37:08.360 --> 37:14.280]  lie i know that guy personally he told me he was going to pull the troops out of iraq he didn't do
[37:14.280 --> 37:18.840]  that he told me so many stories about him i got lots of stories if you give me a couple minutes
[37:18.840 --> 37:25.400]  just to quickly tell you um uh first of all he told me one story about how we started um his
[37:25.400 --> 37:31.880]  life um in a in a rusted out dot and b210 eating jack in the box because i would always talk to him
[37:31.880 --> 37:37.400]  about um eat how how well he eats when i drive i i have a little business i was driving him around
[37:37.400 --> 37:42.840]  i tell him wow you eat really well you you get to eat all this great food and and his whole thing is
[37:42.840 --> 37:51.400]  he kept asking he kept um telling me about how he is really he saw people's money in the bay area
[37:51.400 --> 37:58.120]  and how much money was around here and that was his main focus was he wanted more money and money
[37:58.120 --> 38:04.680]  money money and and uh there's so many things i can tell you about him uh he shakes his handshake
[38:04.680 --> 38:10.200]  is like a lint biscuit he gave me a hug once he invited me to his book signing party i was his
[38:10.200 --> 38:15.880]  biggest supporter i told everybody how great this guy was and then when he got into um office
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.200]  everything he told me was an outright lie and i could not believe it i'm just so
[38:20.760 --> 38:26.360]  disgusted and and that pretty much woke me up well gary it's not just you telling us he said that
[38:26.360 --> 38:32.360]  he said a year before he got elected that i will quote take the troops out of iraq immediately
[38:32.360 --> 38:39.160]  that's a video quote that we have in uh the obama deception it's all lies he said he would end
[38:39.160 --> 38:44.520]  torture he would end the patriot act he would do all of this immediately he said he would hire no
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.120]  lobbyist he said he would hire no donors went back completely on that uh he said he'd have total
[38:50.120 --> 38:56.760]  transparency in government went back on that uh i mean everything he said was a 180 from what he
[38:56.760 --> 39:02.920]  actually did yeah i told him i said i hate the patriot act you gotta get rid of the patriot act
[39:02.920 --> 39:08.360]  please get rid of the patriot then he ended up calling me an isolationist i couldn't believe it
[39:08.360 --> 39:12.280]  and he was really interested in my in my point of view because i think you know i you think i'm
[39:12.280 --> 39:17.160]  conservative and i'm and i said i'm not an isolationist i'm an american i hate the patriot act it
[39:17.160 --> 39:22.200]  takes away always call somebody that doesn't want to pay for the empire for the banks and we don't
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.240]  get the empire even if you're immoral you shouldn't be for the empire you pay for it people uh but
[39:27.240 --> 39:31.400]  they always call you an isolationist oh you don't want to give hundreds of billions of dollars a
[39:31.400 --> 39:35.720]  year to foreign countries you're an isolationist you don't like being ripped off by foreign banks
[39:35.720 --> 39:40.680]  you're an isolationist you don't like the un courts ruling over the us and foreign treaties
[39:40.680 --> 39:45.320]  ruling over the us you're an isolationist no what you are is somebody that didn't want to be a slave
[39:46.440 --> 39:50.040]  yeah i don't want to be a slave and thank god for you and we'll tell us any more stories
[39:50.040 --> 39:56.680]  we'll thank god for you gary but tell us other stories of uh obama and the limo um well he told
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.880]  me for instance like his his relationship with his wife is totally not intimate because i just had
[40:01.880 --> 40:07.560]  my child at the time and i told him you know we we we chat and we were always talking about women
[40:07.560 --> 40:14.360]  and he smoked cigarettes in my car like you wouldn't believe and um uh he told me how is his life with
[40:14.360 --> 40:18.360]  his wife is not intimate because i've had my at that point my wife was just getting over being
[40:18.360 --> 40:25.000]  pregnant and we talked about you know women and that kind of thing and um uh i you know i love the
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.520]  guy i was his biggest supporter before i would tell everybody how great this guy was and then
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.960]  he took um he turned out and he's a complete fraud everything he is is a fraud i mean i knew him
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.880]  when he was a state senator going against alan keys and and he was telling me about how alan keys
[40:41.880 --> 40:46.120]  is such a smuck and nobody will vote for me he's got no chance and they just threw him in there
[40:46.120 --> 40:52.120]  because the only god they had available to him at the time to run against him and then he invited
[40:52.120 --> 40:57.400]  me to his book signing party um six months after the last time i drove him i had a picture taken
[40:57.400 --> 41:01.720]  with him with my wife and child had the book and you know what i did with the book after i figured
[41:01.720 --> 41:07.000]  out what was this guy was all about i sold it on ebay and i bought silver that's what i did with his

[41:53.720 --> 41:59.720]  on very quick um just want to get into uh a little bit on the uh what were you calling it the bank
[41:59.720 --> 42:06.120]  surgate bank surgate yes yeah obviously these guys got a lot of money for something now what are
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.320]  they doing with this money i'm gonna move into uh you know moving into wars these guys got this uh
[42:12.280 --> 42:19.640]  the city over here dupai if you look iraq iran afghanistan pakistan sudan samalia yemen they're
[42:19.640 --> 42:26.360]  creating a perimeter to protect the city is what it seems like well more than that they're they're
[42:26.360 --> 42:31.560]  creating a perimeter uh all the way from eastern europe where they've got bases all the way into
[42:31.560 --> 42:38.840]  pakistan up against china that's really what's going on is a ring uh around uh russia and china
[42:38.840 --> 42:44.280]  and then the ring can also project power back into western europe southern europe the mediterranean
[42:44.280 --> 42:50.760]  north africa uh the middle east and so that's what's happening i just i mean they built this
[42:50.760 --> 42:55.400]  largest tower in the world there they have the dupai palms they have the biggest sure but that was
[42:55.400 --> 43:02.200]  a small part of their speculation yeah that's that's all i wanted touching on thank you for that
[43:02.200 --> 43:07.640]  i know anything else so you want to add uh josh uh i'm kind of nervous right now i can't really
[43:07.640 --> 43:12.040]  but it's a good point you make it is about protecting saudi arabia and those arab emirates
[43:12.040 --> 43:17.480]  around it they are certainly a big part of this uh let's talk to uh mike in pennsylvania
[43:17.480 --> 43:24.120]  mike you're on the air go ahead hey mr jones good evening good afternoon sir welcome um quick
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.080]  comment and then a question about banks or gate as you call it uh first thing i'd like to say is
[43:29.960 --> 43:36.040]  what you saw at the g20 is uh pretty much consistent with the people's republic of pennsylvania
[43:36.040 --> 43:43.080]  and also about uh banks or gate do you think everything's focused on timmy the tax evader
[43:43.880 --> 43:48.440]  in order to uh take the heat off of benanke and paulson and the rest of the crew
[43:50.600 --> 43:55.320]  well i tend to agree with you i mean we can't just go after geithner that's the biggest point
[43:55.320 --> 43:59.880]  i'm trying to make we have to point out that he is part of a larger criminal operation
[43:59.880 --> 44:02.360]  and they are preparing him as a sacrificial goat
[44:02.360 --> 44:05.960]  so uh
[44:07.880 --> 44:11.640]  you think they're just throwing him under the bus and take the heat off of the other two that way
[44:11.640 --> 44:16.680]  when they get him out yeah they're creating a spectacle about just throwing him under the bus
[44:16.680 --> 44:21.400]  they're not even sure they're gonna do that yet yeah that way they could say oh well we got the bad
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.760]  guy and then put another bad guy in this place and you know well more importantly give the people a
[44:26.760 --> 44:32.760]  petty victory okay one of the big bankers got in trouble no they all need to go to jail like made
[44:32.760 --> 44:38.120]  off they've all been engaged in scams bigger than made off on record the entire derivative scam
[44:39.560 --> 44:45.640]  is a ponzi scheme but instead of the ponzi scheme going bust the bankers made money on the way up
[44:45.640 --> 44:52.680]  and on the way down do you feel that this has anything to do with the uh audit the fed bill
[44:52.680 --> 44:58.840]  that's gone through yes i mean the audit the fed bill has gone through the house and then now it's
[44:58.840 --> 45:02.760]  getting more and more sponsors in the senate because people finally know who the real government is
[45:02.760 --> 45:07.400]  they go wait a minute going back to richard nixon it doesn't matter who's in office the
[45:07.400 --> 45:11.800]  same group of banks completely run everything bill clinton changes the law so they can steal all this
[45:11.800 --> 45:22.360]  money george bush expands it uh and uh now obama goes absolutely wild i mean it's the same group
[45:22.360 --> 45:30.600]  of people the same coterie the same inner group does you feel anything will really change after
[45:31.400 --> 45:37.560]  yes sir and listen listen it's it's the federal reserve that sets the policies of deindustrialization
[45:37.560 --> 45:41.960]  it's the federal reserve using phony and environmentalism to steal private property
[45:41.960 --> 45:48.120]  and to take property without just compensation they are the criminals they write the white
[45:48.120 --> 45:55.240]  papers calling for world government you want to know who the new world order is this is the new
[45:55.240 --> 45:59.160]  world order this is who we're talking about i appreciate your call we're going to go really

[46:36.680 --> 46:41.720]  we need to throw him under the bus robert gates we need to pressure him to get to get for him to be
[46:41.720 --> 46:47.880]  fired because uh for him lying on oath on tv he thought he's currently on right now lying
[46:48.600 --> 46:53.960]  about this whole situation the media i think uh we need to continue pressuring them everyone

[49:03.160 --> 49:08.120]  this is a level five pandemic this is a completely insane phone call i'm going to put you on hold
[49:08.120 --> 49:18.440]  and then let you counter back quickly um i posted the information from the state of texas
[49:19.960 --> 49:24.760]  total coantel pro now i don't believe you are coantel pro government is information they put
[49:24.760 --> 49:31.560]  it out and then people like you repeat it like a mockingbird they put it out and then you parrot it
[49:31.560 --> 49:42.200]  it uh on record in april i talked to a state official who gave me the minutes of the meeting
[49:42.200 --> 49:48.440]  with the federal government and the state health board and yes i got it from an official at the
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.960]  state level of education and we posted it with the names of the doctors with the phone numbers of
[49:53.960 --> 50:00.280]  the doctors saying we're telling the public it's a level four we've already gone to level five
[50:00.280 --> 50:07.080]  and we're going to be going to level six now a month later they said we were really at level five
[50:07.080 --> 50:14.200]  now we're really at level six so i was right about that and i said it was hype to bring in a
[50:14.200 --> 50:21.160]  police state and make a bunch of money so that is insane this information right there i mean
[50:21.160 --> 50:30.440]  i mean even when i post something the coantel pro says i didn't we posted that email we posted the
[50:30.440 --> 50:37.400]  stinking thing i mean what planet are you living on we were right i said in april that they were
[50:37.400 --> 50:41.560]  aren't really at level five and going to level six and then that was announced months later i mean
[50:41.560 --> 50:47.560]  what more do you want from me and then the other two points i've got to remember them and then try
[50:47.560 --> 50:54.040]  and then try to briefly counter them what were the other two it was uh oh yeah let's not audit the

[1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:56.120]  the strategy for stopping them they have overstepped their bounds they have engaged an arrogant
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:03.240]  hubris filled a thieving on the grand scale they have overstepped miscalculated and just
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:08.760]  like i told you with climate gate the email gate just like i've told you on other subjects we have
[1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:15.400]  a big chance to really have another big victory here so i'm going to play clips of geithner there's
[1:09:15.400 --> 1:09:21.240]  so many and uh bernacky saying they won't say where the money is why that's so important
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:28.680]  showing the perjury they've now committed the white house now saying that geithner had no
[1:09:28.680 --> 1:09:33.800]  knowledge of this the money from aig to goldman sacks and others that is coming up but when we

[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:59.160]  to go to level five and six with the flu and that never happened and you don't have that document
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:06.760]  when we wrote the article at the time texas doctor claims swine flu cases far worse than reported
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:15.640]  and then you we have the internal email sent out to health department people at the state of texas
[1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:20.600]  and it says on the email not for distribution and it has the phone number and name of the health
[1:10:20.600 --> 1:10:29.320]  department doctor one of the head health department doctors uh in san antonio putting this out and
[1:10:29.320 --> 1:10:35.320]  you can go read it and it doesn't matter you know instead of us being proven right like wow alex in
[1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:41.720]  january months and months before the flu hype started said i don't know what's going to happen
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:47.800]  but the government in upstate new york we have the internal state of new york documents that
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:52.520]  they're telling the cemeteries get ready for hundreds of thousands dead buried per cemetery
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:57.160]  posted the full secret document with the names and phone numbers in the state of new york
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:04.600]  headlines played the audio and had the investigative journalist on uh from the newspaper that's
[1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:09.080]  what it's called online in indiana and illinois who interviewed the emergency manager there
[1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:14.360]  when fema came in and said get ready for marshal law over a million dead from chicago from the flu
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:18.840]  i said i don't know if this is really going to happen whether this is just a stage the feds
[1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:23.560]  taken over the states or whether it's just to make money on flu shots but we've never seen a
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:30.360]  preparation like this they're saying there's going to be a massive pandemic then april rolls around
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:38.040]  three months later two and a half months later and they hype up the non-event in mexico
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:43.720]  we expose that as a non-event then they say it's going to be horribly devastating here
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:47.160]  then we find out the vaccines for the mercury and all this other garbage
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:52.200]  and i say i don't know what they're going to do but i know this they were preparing secretly
[1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:57.160]  before this even broke out this is a fraud and i said here's the state of texas document
[1:11:58.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  that we're really at level five because they were they were saying in april we were level four
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:08.360]  and that we're going to level six and then it came out months later exactly what i said was true
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:12.280]  don't you remember him saying oh we were really at level five and then six months ago but we
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:18.760]  didn't want to tell the public i mean i publish it with the name and the phone number and coantel
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:25.160]  pro just says we never went to level five or six alex is lying and he never posted the document
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:35.720]  and then that's parroted and i mean i don't toot my horn enough we told you from bilderberg
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:46.120]  in 2008 that they were going to run up gas prices they were 60 bucks a gallon then it ran up to 150
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:54.840]  people couldn't believe it that was from bilderberg we were right about that we reported that they
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:13:00.840]  were going to have some big flu hysteria in january over and over and over again all those
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:07.800]  videos all those audios are all over the web i i need to hire more people and just have someone
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:12.680]  who posts all the places we were right all the places we were accurate see that scares the
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:17.000]  establishment folks that we understand their number that that that we've got their number
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:28.920]  that that we know how they're operating that scares them i mean imagine the boldness of coantel pro
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:35.080]  and how weak minded the government thinks people are and they obviously are to come out in a united
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:40.440]  front for months and say that we never went to level six and i'm a liar when i said two months
[1:13:40.440 --> 1:13:47.800]  before they announced level six that they already gone to level six because here it is flu update
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:58.840]  from doctor general g i t t e r l e this is email number eight two two zero this email message including
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:03.640]  all attachments is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential student
[1:14:03.640 --> 1:14:08.840]  and or employee information unauthorized use disclosures prohibited under the family education
[1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:15.320]  rights and privacy act 20 usc i mean it's all right here go read it it says if you get an
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:20.760]  undisclosed copy please call the senator immediately or reply by email and destroy all copies of the
[1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:25.400]  original message including attachments so we post this with the name and phone numbers for you
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:32.200]  and the feds get hoppin mad and just come out and say jones never posted it and parents go he
[1:14:32.200 --> 1:14:40.360]  never posted it he never posted it hundreds of websites the day we posted this april 30th went
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:45.320]  and put it on their sites it's on record we did and record that's a lie but that's how they operate
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:54.520]  they think you're so dumb and then it goes on here during the night we cross the threshold for the
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:59.720]  definition of world health organization phase six global pandemic this is not happened in any of our
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:05.720]  lifetime so far we are in uncharted territory he goes on to say president obama will declare an
[1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:12.840]  emergency sometime the next 72 to 96 hours which he actually did about two weeks later a little
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:20.040]  bit longer than they thought when this happens all public gathering will be canceled for 10 days so
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:25.160]  this is what the feds were telling the state of texas i suggest all of us avoid public gatherings
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:29.400]  outdoor activities this is how they were scaring the states to go along with it tamboflu was running
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:35.400]  out then they go into how they're going to announce the public later he goes on there are 10 to
[1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:42.680]  25 times more actual cases not possible but actual so this is from a health department meeting
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:53.160]  you can go read it all or yourself so there you have it
[1:15:55.560 --> 1:16:01.080]  and then i was told by this state employee that gave me this information who i know by the way
[1:16:01.080 --> 1:16:07.160]  that they were told as the as the document says we're really at level five not four and
[1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:12.680]  where they're going to announce a six in the next few weeks and they did in about a month and a half
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:19.080]  actually so again but does that matter to the disinformation operatives no they just say this
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:34.200]  document doesn't exist when we posted it that day that's how disinformation works we're on record in
[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:38.520]  january telling you they were planning something big with the flu and telling you it was going to
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:43.400]  be a fraud to make money and now here's the daily mail today i have all the other mainstream news
[1:16:43.400 --> 1:16:51.480]  articles the false pandemic drug firms cashed in on scare over swine flu claims euro health chief
[1:16:51.480 --> 1:16:55.480]  now members of the un are in trouble for lying and putting out fear mongering
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:01.160]  when the federal government the un come out and put out this type of info you bet we cover it
[1:17:01.160 --> 1:17:07.240]  because they're capable of anything the swine flu outbreak was a false pandemic driven by drug
[1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:13.160]  companies that stood to make billions how many times did i tell you this of pounds from a worldwide
[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:20.120]  scare a leading health expert has claimed wolf gain woodrig head of the health council of europe
[1:17:20.120 --> 1:17:24.120]  accused the makers of flu drugs and vaccines of influencing the world health organization's
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:30.760]  decision to declare a pandemic this led to the pharmaceutical firms ensuring enormous gains
[1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:37.160]  while countries including the uk squandered their meager health budgets on millions being vaccinated
[1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:42.600]  against a relatively mild disease that's killed less than a third and that's conservative more
[1:17:42.600 --> 1:17:47.640]  like 10 percent of what the regular flu does this far along into the year a resolution proposed by
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:52.520]  dr woodrig i want to get him on calling for an investigation into the role the drug firms
[1:17:52.520 --> 1:17:56.680]  has been passed to the council of europe the strausberg based senate responsible for european
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:18:04.120]  court of human rights an emergency debate will be held on this later this month dr woodrig claims
[1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:09.000]  comes as it emerged the british government is desperately trying to offload up to one
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.720]  billion pounds or close to two billion dollars of swine flu vaccine ordered at the height of
[1:18:13.720 --> 1:18:19.160]  the scare because the public didn't buy into it what did we do in january when they found
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:24.520]  out they were getting mass graves ready in illinois indiana arizona and new york state and we got
[1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:29.400]  the secret documents and interviewed the health department heads and emergency managers
[1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:36.520]  we said we don't know what's really going to happen but we've never seen the feds do this and
[1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:40.440]  then out of the blue they start hyping the flu and we said we don't know what's going to happen
[1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:46.600]  with this but this is dangerous this is serious business people didn't buy into their hopes
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:52.280]  they made huge profits off of it but still not as big as they would have but the government's
[1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:56.120]  bought it so their profits were guaranteed there's a revolving door between these government health
[1:18:56.120 --> 1:19:00.520]  chiefs and these private companies now a lot of them are getting in trouble and getting indicted
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:05.560]  in different countries and so the truth is coming out another huge victory if we would have bought
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:12.600]  into their fraud they may have gone with a real pandemic now let's expand on that if we would
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:17.800]  have gone along with their fraud on kopenhagen they would have won right now they're still got
[1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:21.720]  their world government but it didn't get everybody to sign on to it and it's in deep trouble and
[1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:28.600]  sinking fast great job we've we've gotten a lot of the bad stuff stripped out of the health care
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:32.440]  bill it looks like though it's still in secret but they're saying the abortion clauses and
[1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:36.280]  some of the jail time's being cut back and we could probably be able to repeal it
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:42.680]  when republicans take the congress we're fighting back and you bet the feds are mad and try to get
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:47.240]  us all in fighting with each other because if they're not successful they're going down
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:55.240]  we did a great job on the flu and your co-intel pro failed and our credibility is risen
[1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:59.400]  they're desperate to destroy our credibility because they they know we know the score

[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:33.560]  reserves discount tell us who they are no because the reason that is counterproductive and will
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:38.600]  destroy the value of the program is that banks will not come to the isn't that too bad sorry in
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:42.440]  other words isn't that too bad they took the money but they don't want to be public about
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:45.640]  the fact that they received that we heard a whole lot about aig they're on the front pages
[1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:49.720]  these are very now i got banks and i have businesses in the state of vermont who are in a lot of
[1:24:49.720 --> 1:24:53.960]  trouble not banks our banks by the way doing pretty well now how do these guys who are honest
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:25:00.040]  business people get it do you have to be a large greedy reckless financial institution to apply for
[1:25:00.040 --> 1:25:05.640]  these monies there is no subsidy there is no capital involved there is no gift in total line okay
[1:25:05.640 --> 1:25:13.080]  that's enough from him we have clip after clip a bernacky telling grace and telling senator sanders
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:22.600]  telling ron paul telling congressman stern telling issa congressman issa that they will not tell
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:28.200]  him where the money went we're going to be playing those clips into the next hour webster griffin
[1:25:28.200 --> 1:25:32.600]  tarpley is going to join us to talk about bankster gate and how we bring down the private
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:37.000]  federal reserve and give the power back to congress and stop these internationalist
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  and i'm going to be breaking down the strategy and how these people have miscalculated coming up but
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  here's another clip of bernacky before congress lending to those banks we're lending to the central
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:55.640]  bank the central bank is responsible for repaying us so who got the money to financial institutions
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:26:02.840]  in in europe in other countries which ones i don't know half a trillion dollars and you don't
[1:26:02.840 --> 1:26:08.440]  know who got the money the loan went to the the loans go to the central banks and they they then
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:13.720]  put them out there to their institutions to try to bring down short-term interest rates and
[1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:18.200]  dollar markets around the world well let's start with which central banks got the money there's
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:24.920]  14 of them which are listed in our i'm sure they're listed in here somewhere all right so
[1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:29.400]  who actually made that decision to hand out a trillion dollars that way half a trillion dollars
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:35.800]  who made that decision the federal market committee okay and was it done at one time or in a series
[1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:41.880]  of meetings a series of meetings and under what legal authority we have a long-standing legal
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:46.440]  authority to do swaps with other central banks do you have an emergency it's not an emergency
[1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:56.920]  authority of any kind anything specific about it um do you know the okay so there he is saying
[1:26:56.920 --> 1:27:01.560]  you won't say where the money went now we have geithner saying similar things over and over
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:07.880]  and over again in fall of the republic in the obama deception the point here is you now have
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:14.360]  bloomberg reporting last thursday that geithner as the head of the private fellow reserve now
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:22.920]  there's bernacky in early 2009 testifying before the house banking committee and and congressman
[1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:32.360]  grayson and he won't say who got the money and he says the private central banks through the
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:39.800]  federal reserve they know but they won't say well who was the head in 2008 of the head federal
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:44.280]  reserve bank that makes all the decisions other branch banks have criticized them kansas city
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:50.600]  dallas and others saying what was happening was illegal even fellow reserve bank chairman
[1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:55.880]  of different regions have said this is wrong they've been out of the loop trying to cover their butts
[1:27:57.400 --> 1:28:03.560]  who was the head guy it was geithner at the new york fed and so he's talking about well the
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:08.840]  fellow reserve got that money but we're not going to say who got it so they're openly saying we
[1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:15.080]  won't tell you who got it and he's openly admitting the man that made the decision was timmy geithner
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:22.680]  and so now we have gibbs the white house press secretary friday unequivocally saying and
[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:29.240]  geithner's on record saying he didn't know that the new york fed the head of policy for the
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:33.320]  federal reserve holding company it's a holding company for private banks well they don't want an
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:41.800]  audit he said this is the key he said he knew nothing about orders to the federal reserve
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:48.280]  to tell aig with the 220 plus billion they were given a loan that they gave out to jp morgan
[1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:54.680]  chase goldman sacks and others for bonuses he's saying that he wasn't involved in the decision
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:29:02.440]  to tell them to make it secret even though the fed chairman bernacky and the new york fed chairman
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:09.000]  the real head of the system at the time geithner are on record separately in congress saying we
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:14.120]  won't tell you who got the money so they're on record making it secret but now they've lied to
[1:29:14.120 --> 1:29:20.840]  the public they've now lied to congress they now have made public statements saying that they didn't
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:26.680]  know that the federal reserve that they run told aig to keep that secret even though it came out
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:33.480]  nobody's pointing this out seven eight months ago remember this and that bank of america actually
[1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:40.200]  recorded it in the meetings when paulson in 2008 head of the treasury was telling them they had to
[1:29:40.200 --> 1:29:46.040]  take the money and had to keep it secret who they gave it to they used bank of america aig and others

[1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:25.800]  now to the Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner potentially facing criminal charges according
[1:33:25.800 --> 1:33:30.280]  to Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano there's a long way to go between here
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:37.320]  and there so stay with us it all deals with how he the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
[1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:41.720]  handled AIG and he was in charge of that the American insurance group during the
[1:33:41.720 --> 1:33:46.280]  depths of the financial crisis it's about how what he did with them Geithner headed the bank
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:53.800]  then Bloomberg News reports that the New York Fed told AIG to withhold details from the public
[1:33:54.360 --> 1:34:00.600]  about its payments to banks it reports AIG wrote in a draft that it paid banks including
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:07.400]  Goldman Sachs every penny on the dollar for toxic credit default swaps those are insurance
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:11.720]  like contracts for financial institutions that aren't regulated and don't have to be backed by
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:17.400]  cash the New York Fed crossed that line out of the report according to to report citing emails
[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:21.320]  between the two companies with us now to help explain this and what the legal ramifications
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:24.440]  are Judge Andrew Napolitano i gotta tell you i just read all that i didn't read it very well
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:27.960]  and i don't understand it i think you read it quite well i didn't read it well well which
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:32.280]  would you help us understand sure Tim Geithner was the president of the New York Federal Reserve
[1:34:32.280 --> 1:34:38.440]  Bank in the fall of 2008 when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury and the White House and the
[1:34:38.440 --> 1:34:44.760]  Congress decided to bail out AIG right in the process of that bailing out of AIG many many
[1:34:44.760 --> 1:34:49.000]  documents were exchanged if you went to the bank to borrow money you'd have to fill out documents
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:54.920]  one of the documents AIG filled out said we owe x dollars to Goldman Sachs and we plan on paying
[1:34:54.920 --> 1:35:02.600]  the 100 cents on the dollar according to Bloomberg emails that came out yesterday say that lawyers
[1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:09.720]  for the Federal Reserve Bank said we were told to strike this from the form so that AIG would not
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:15.880]  reveal to the Treasury Department or to the public that this money was going to be paid
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:22.680]  to Goldman Sachs because that's a politically toxic issue Goldman Sachs making a fortune
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:30.120]  making 100 cents on the dollar with federal funds now if you go to buy a $25 savings bond
[1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:35.480]  from the federal government and you falsify the document to acquire that bond you can go to jail
[1:35:35.480 --> 1:35:42.280]  that's right if you borrow a hundred and eighty five billion dollars from the government like AIG
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:48.920]  did and you falsify a document even if the government told you to do so the people involved
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:57.480]  can go to jail according okay so this is the magnitude of what we're talking about here ladies
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:05.000]  and gentlemen i want you to hear it from napolitano at fox but also ed schultz is talking about this
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:12.040]  with former new york governor elliot spitzer now remember spitzer right as the banker bail
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:18.920]  out had just happened in early 2009 he came out and talked about how this was criminal how this
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:24.120]  was a fraud how you couldn't have the federal reserve in a revolving door with the federal
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:30.200]  regulators paying themselves hundreds of millions of dollars at least 200 million paid to then treasury
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:37.720]  secretary paulson money paid to geitner formerly of goldman sachs all of these guys formerly worked
[1:36:37.720 --> 1:36:46.040]  there or were the heads of it in the case of paulson okay now we have them on record this is all
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:53.320]  the confidence game arrogantly telling congress over and over again tim geitner bernacky all of
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:37:00.760]  them we're not going to tell you where the money went we're not going to tell you where the money
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:10.200]  went we're not going to tell you where the money went well we know where the money went because
[1:37:10.200 --> 1:37:15.240]  they file it on their tax forms billions and billions and billions and billions went to
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:21.800]  each of the big private federal reserve shareholding banks but the management team that got the lion
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:26.280]  share the people they chose in this criminal operation were goldman sachs remember goldman
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:31.560]  sachs late last year came out in a five-part series their internal emails got out from federal lawsuits
[1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:38.040]  in mclatchy newspapers that they were planning the housing bubble they knew they were planning
[1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:45.000]  to implode the credit default swaps and the insurance policies on this crud these derivatives
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:52.200]  that they rated and so they sold all of this to bank of america and everybody else in aig and others
[1:37:52.200 --> 1:38:00.360]  insured it and so they paid it off with taxpayer money they premeditatedly did this and the document
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:05.480]  show they did it to destroy their competition bear sterns lemond brothers and others which
[1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:13.640]  a year plus ago back in october of last year or of 2008 of two years ago all of our financial
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:26.760]  guests tarply bob Chapman paul craig roberts all top economist all economist told you exactly what
[1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:38.680]  was going on precisely what came out 10 months ago full of the republic came out three months ago
[1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:44.040]  two months ago two and a half months ago what came out 10 months ago obama deception what detailed
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:49.800]  all of this my point in saying that is this is all part of the public record the fact that
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:54.920]  bloomberg came out and said oh you're excising federal documents that's a crime and geithner
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:39:01.000]  says no i did not know anything about that the confidence man has now finally acted like what
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:06.360]  he's doing is illegal it was always illegal now people are going wait this is illegal
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:08.680]  doesn't matter if you're wearing a three thousand dollar suit
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.280]  does it matter if your daddy was the employer of obama's mama
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:21.480]  doesn't matter how powerful you are son you're in trouble and now house panel once
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:27.800]  geithner to testify about new york fed and aig we're going to cover all this and my strategy
[1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:32.040]  my idea to take the fight to the enemy and fully discredit these people once and for all because
[1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:36.920]  it's all or nothing if we don't they win and i want to describe what the bankers winning looks like
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:44.280]  well let's go to ed schultz friday elliott spitzer cover is his geithner aig new york
[1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:50.440]  fed investigation here it is and in my playbook tonight i think treasury secretary tim geithner
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:55.000]  has got a story to tell and so does the house oversight committee because they want him to
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:01.080]  testify about his time when he was the head of the federal reserve bank of new york we found out
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:08.120]  yesterday that while geithner was in charge the new york fed told insurance giant aig to keep quiet
[1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:14.840]  about overpaying wall street firms using their taxpayer funded bailout money that information
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:21.160]  came to light after emails between aig and the fed were made public now former new york governor
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:27.400]  elliott spitzer thinks there is more skeletons in aig's closet he's pushing for full disclosure
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:34.440]  the company's emails accounting documents and financial models from the last 10 years governor
[1:40:34.440 --> 1:40:39.000]  spitzer joining us tonight here on the ed show governor good to have you with us thank you ed
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  always great to be here and i want to play this piece of tape first because it came over the
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.360]  white house briefing today this is robert gibbs somewhat defending tim geithner here it is
[1:40:48.360 --> 1:40:57.480]  check their geithner was not involved in any of these emails these decisions did not raise to
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:04.280]  his level at the fed these are emails and decisions made by officials at a independent
[1:41:04.280 --> 1:41:10.120]  regulatory agency how do you know that he wasn't involved he was a leader of the york fed so right
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:17.000]  but he wasn't on the emails that have been talked about and wasn't party to the decision
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:24.600]  that that was being made now elliot your prosecutor i mean the white house is on record now this is
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:28.920]  pretty dangerous territory if they're wrong isn't it well yes and i'm a little surprised he was
[1:41:28.920 --> 1:41:32.920]  making such definitive statements about tim geithner is involved okay lack of involvement because
[1:41:32.920 --> 1:41:40.120]  frankly you can watch the rest of the clip where the governor says that they're in a lot of trouble
[1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:48.280]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com now you notice that spitzer got set up for visiting
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:54.760]  high price hookers and that the fbi had been surveilling him for years and that's because
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:42:01.640]  they knew that elliot spitzer was a good guy they knew that he actually was against the
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:07.560]  Ponzi schemes and the fraud and he wanted to make his name for himself as a presidential contender
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:13.240]  in the future by going after these people and he wrote editorials and major newspapers exposing
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:22.120]  the fraud while it was happening in late 2008 and so in the midst of that they shut him down and
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:31.000]  discredited him now it's not good morally to be running around having sex with hookers but what's
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:36.760]  worse a man like and women me look at king david having people killed so you could have their women
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:44.920]  what's worse a man like and women or private central banks bankrupting the financial system
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:50.840]  threatening martial law against congress in october of 2008 if they didn't give total and complete
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:56.920]  power over to the banks to do whatever they wanted now they're going to argue that because congress
[1:42:56.920 --> 1:43:02.280]  said okay you've got a blank check they could do this but that's like saying that the weimar republic
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:08.440]  capitulated to hitler after he fire bombed the reistag and gave him unlimited power
[1:43:08.440 --> 1:43:16.360]  just because the government says someone can commit crimes doesn't mean a president can't
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:23.960]  give himself a pardon for barbecuing small children on the white house lawn the government
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:29.080]  can't come out and say black people are slaves again and say well we say it's the law so get out
[1:43:29.080 --> 1:43:36.120]  there to the farm and we're going to hit you a plow to you like you're a mule but even in the powers
[1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:41.480]  that congress unlawfully unconstitutionally illegally gave them they still couldn't do this
[1:43:42.120 --> 1:43:50.280]  and and that's why we have the clips in fall the republic and obama deception where
[1:43:50.280 --> 1:43:54.360]  paulson and others are asked who gave you the authority to give yourself bonuses in the tune
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:59.720]  of hundreds of millions and paulson turns red and starts stuttering and says well i
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:07.560]  the treasury department did he didn't say i did he's the head of the treasury i mean what's next
[1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:12.440]  is paulson going to say oh i didn't know treasury gave me a waiver i'm just the treasury head
[1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:18.680]  and that's what he says he says well you know the different regulatory bodies within the treasury
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:24.440]  department decided that was fine and got a got a waiver and the congressman says oh who gave
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:32.920]  you that waiver he said oh the treasury department folks they can't give themselves waivers to steal
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:38.360]  billions of dollars don't you understand that it's fundamental and so they just thought because
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:43.560]  they're wearing fancy three-piece suits and they're up there on television waving magic wands that
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:53.720]  they could get away with this and we as a people have to point out that the bankers are the criminals
[1:44:53.720 --> 1:44:57.160]  they are the new world order people every day well who the new world order well who are they
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:03.400]  they are the ultra rich robber barons at the turn of the last century 110 years ago roughly
[1:45:03.400 --> 1:45:08.840]  who got laws passed in europe england the united states that they could control the issuance of
[1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:16.680]  total currency and credit so a handful of families less than 20 families were able to produce unlimited
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:23.160]  fiat wealth so they could buy armies they could buy newspapers they could buy media
[1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:28.360]  they could buy politicians they could buy factories they could buy land but that isn't enough for them
[1:45:28.360 --> 1:45:32.200]  so you look at who founded the un the rockefeller's one of the chief families in banking
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:37.480]  you look at who founded nato the rockefeller's on record you look at who set up the e you the
[1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:41.560]  Rothschild's rockefeller's in the royal family of england who are related to the dutch royal family
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:47.400]  who are so rich their wealth is secret according to the associated press that i mean the dutch
[1:45:47.400 --> 1:45:50.920]  may be richer than the royals of england their cousins the same people
[1:45:53.800 --> 1:45:57.400]  it's like if you got a french bulldog it's related to every other french bulldog or a doberman
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:02.440]  it's related to all other dobermans i mean it's just one group of crooks
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:10.680]  and they set up there and devised the phony environmental movement over a hundred years
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:18.120]  ago knowing people care about conservation knowing that t.s lewis's the jungle had just come out
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:23.800]  about the horrible working conditions and toxic waste and so they said well we'll control the
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:29.800]  opposition we'll come in and have the federal government conserve all these lands and things
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:35.640]  that our competition owns thus making our wealth more valuable i mean if you shut down your competitions
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:40.920]  coal mines or gold mines or silver mines or timber and then your your timber gold and silver
[1:46:41.640 --> 1:46:46.360]  and oil gets left alone what happens it's called artificial scarcity how does the
[1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:51.160]  the beers with the oppenheimer family how do they have a world diamond monopoly when diamonds are
[1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:54.840]  semi precious they do it through force and government coercion and power
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:47:03.640]  this is the world government and that's why they're in the bbc announcing yesterday oh for
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:10.680]  environmental reasons we want rationing of food you'll get your national ID card and when you
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:16.520]  bought your allotment of food and shelter for the year it taps out and you pay us the rex the rest
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:25.080]  in taxes when you look at who funds the nature conservancy sierra club the un all the environmental
[1:47:25.080 --> 1:47:31.320]  land grabbing groups it's the imf the world bank the bank of england the federal reserve
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:36.680]  goldman sacks jp morgan chase are two of the biggest contributors they're always at the very top of
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:47.400]  the list generally the top two paulson has given over a hundred million dollars go look it up
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:51.000]  just to radical environmentalist movements
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:47:59.400]  this is how they take your property this is why as lord montan agreed with me last week
[1:48:00.040 --> 1:48:02.920]  they had the ruling what was it six years ago new london
[1:48:02.920 --> 1:48:10.680]  the kilo new london decision did you read the decision it just didn't say that private
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:15.880]  interest can lobby to have your land taken it says you don't have to be paid just compensation
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:23.640]  in fact queue up that clip out of australia with the australian farmer because the same thing
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:30.440]  is now happening in the united states in england where they just openly say we're taking your
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:37.160]  property without paying you if your land ever had trees on it you cleared it now you can't
[1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:44.520]  use it and there's a tax on any sheep you put on it that's coming here the un biospheres hundreds
[1:48:44.520 --> 1:48:50.440]  of miles around major parks you can't have your own cattle or a gold mine this is on record this
[1:48:50.440 --> 1:48:56.200]  already goes on here and this is receivership to the banks play part of the clip it is spencer
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:02.600]  could easily be any one of us a hardworking ozzie now embroiled in a life and death fight to save
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:09.400]  his home and his livelihood he doesn't want sympathy he just wants a fair go now on day 46
[1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:15.560]  of a hunger strike his family has grave concerns for his health and want him to give up his tower
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:21.000]  protest before he does that he wants a meeting with kevin rutt but as james thomas found out the
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:27.400]  prime minister apparently has more pressing matters to deal with than a farmer in his backyard the
[1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:33.800]  first two nights i was minus four but the rain and the wind and the swaying all at once is just
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:41.240]  whips you about like you're you're a mixmaster i just keep going i just keep going i just keep
[1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:46.680]  going i've got the wrong person who think i'll walk away as a part of australian's commitment to
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:52.520]  protect native vegetation and to reduce carbon emissions under the kioto protocol peter and
[1:49:52.520 --> 1:49:58.120]  thousands of farmers like him across the country have been subjected to a government imposed ban
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:05.080]  on land clearing the saved trees and natural carbon sinks worth an estimated 10.8 billion
[1:50:05.080 --> 1:50:10.600]  dollars to the government in reduced carbon emissions should kevin rutt's emissions trading scheme go
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:18.600]  ahead but here's the rub the farmers who can no longer develop this land have received no compensation
[1:50:18.600 --> 1:50:23.480]  they're welcome to take my land but the constitution says they have to pay not only for him
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:29.800]  farce as well he's fighting for all australian farmers peter's hunger strike has galvanized the

[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:31.160]  farmers it's people that own things property rights freehold that's what it means the only response
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:35.880]  from the prime minister's office is he has said the government does not take any notice of people
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:42.760]  taking passive passive protests as in what hunger strikes or threatening the government they say
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:51.720]  we make laws and rules and policies one of the copenhagen agreement state in copenhagen
[1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:59.880]  it said that you will pay taxes on land and all property and whatever the global government
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:05.240]  wants it will take and give to the imf and world bank themselves international arms of
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:10.280]  the federal reserve and bank of england for global government of foreign by the bankers
[1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:14.840]  this is why the bankers must be defeated they are now coming out saying they want to
[1:55:14.840 --> 1:55:21.000]  have a national sales tax and value-added tax and excise taxes to quote pay off the debt
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.720]  obama has grown the government more than any president before him spending more than all
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:33.880]  presidents combined in less than a year they are raping us they are stealing everything and the
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:41.800]  new london kilo decision in the supreme court of coming up on six years ago states they can take

[1:55:56.440 --> 1:56:01.240]  going to get a big chemical plant for a pharma maker and now that big pharma has pulled out
[1:56:01.240 --> 1:56:06.040]  nothing's being built but they bulldozed everybody's houses and all over the country i see reports
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:11.960]  of people being paid nothing in texas you get orders that oh this company wants your land
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:16.360]  here's the offer five cents on the dollar if you don't agree in one month we just take it
[1:56:18.280 --> 1:56:23.640]  this is all for the bankers so we had better expose geitner and point out that he's only the
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:28.760]  scapegoat yes he's engaged in crime we need state grand juries federal grand juries to indict
[1:56:28.760 --> 1:56:34.120]  these people need an audit of the fed we need geitner before congress we need full investigations
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:39.240]  we need all those emails and orders released where they were ordering the money from the bailout
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:48.920]  directly into geitner paulson summers ruben greenspan bernacky all directly into their
[1:56:48.920 --> 1:56:54.360]  pockets and thousands of others hundreds of millions of dollars apiece some of the ceo's
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:57:01.400]  of those companies one made over a billion dollars off the bailout personally webster tarpley's
[1:57:01.400 --> 1:57:05.800]  coming up at the eight after in the second segment of the next hour it will continue discussing this
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:10.680]  and take your calls but uh we're gonna go live at prison planet dot tv and t minus three minutes
[1:57:10.680 --> 1:57:16.440]  when we start the third hour the halfway point in this radio broadcast i want to make a correction
[1:57:16.440 --> 1:57:20.680]  i said another name of an author i got a mixed up was upton sinclair who wrote the jungle i think
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:25.560]  he also wrote oil or there will be blood the point is i read that back in high school about the
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:29.880]  horrors of the industrialist and how they set up the environmental movement later i was making
[1:57:29.880 --> 1:57:34.200]  that point it was upton sinclair wrote the jungle thanks to rob do for correcting me on that this
[1:57:34.200 --> 1:57:41.640]  type of mistakes i make but all of this is going on the people now know who the real enemy is the
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:47.080]  people now have identified who they really are that they're involved in crime but here's the deal
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:51.320]  if we don't expose these people they're going to bankrupt the states further and federalize them
[1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:56.520]  north congress meant to ensure that the military keeps the people down if they try to peacefully
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:02.680]  stand up so that this criminal receivership this transfer this bankrupting of the u.s like the
[1:58:02.680 --> 1:58:07.480]  imf and world bank have done to countless third world countries can be completed we are going
[1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:14.600]  into bondage like mexico or north korea or nigeria we must say no to this now this was done through
[1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:20.520]  fraud they create ponzi schemes so big they tricked the governments under threat of financial
[1:58:20.520 --> 1:58:26.680]  collapse into giving the bankers total power it's fraudulent it's wrong and whether you're a

[2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:36.360]  noon to 4 p.m eastern we saw them cast the last two hours 2 to 4 p.m eastern at prison planet
[2:00:36.360 --> 2:00:44.760]  dot tv we are live there as well so last thursday bloomberg drops this bombshell give me a document
[2:00:44.760 --> 2:00:55.240]  shot on that geithner geithner's fed told aig to limit swaps disclosure now we know geithner
[2:00:56.200 --> 2:01:07.640]  and paulson and bernacky and others are all on record are on record over and over and over
[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:13.960]  and over again saying they will not tell you where the money went and who got the money once they
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:19.800]  went into holding banks the french the german the british the dutch the us the canadian and others
[2:01:19.800 --> 2:01:25.560]  the money we know was paid in massive bonuses and served out but the private federal reserve the
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:30.680]  holding company and the governmental treasury department on record will not say where the money
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:36.680]  went but it later came out it was given to the very people running the government that were
[2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:41.720]  taking the bailout money now geithner was the head of the most important part of the federal reserve
[2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:47.560]  the new york fed in the fall and winter of 2008 and that's in bloomberg
[2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:54.600]  and he has now gotten in a lot of trouble because internal documents and emails have
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:59.400]  been released where aig one of the big holding companies they use for plausible deniability
[2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:05.560]  to divvy out the money themselves it's come out that the new york fed told them do not let this
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:10.280]  be public and we separately have geithner on tv saying don't let it be public now geithner says
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:15.240]  he'd know anything about that plausible deniability that is more evidence of fraud when on record
[2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:19.080]  he will not let people know and will never talk about it and says i won't tell you
[2:02:22.280 --> 2:02:28.120]  so the issue here is this is crime this is illegal as judge napolitano and ed schultz and many others
[2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:33.400]  on the left and right have pointed out and it's bipartisan it goes across party lines and shows
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:40.600]  how the banking dictatorship is the real problem it appears that the new york fed deliberately
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:46.040]  pressured aig to restrict guys give me a document cam shot it appears that the new york fed
[2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:51.400]  deliberately pressured aig to restrict and delay the disclosure of important information
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:56.200]  said issa a california republican taxpayers deserve full and complete disclosure under our
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:01.480]  nation's security laws not the beholding of politically inconvenient information geithner
[2:03:01.480 --> 2:03:07.480]  had no role they're saying secretary geithner played no role in these decisions meg riley a treasury
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:14.840]  spokeswoman said in an email he was recused from working on the involvement even though he was the
[2:03:14.840 --> 2:03:20.920]  head he gave the orders involves specific companies including aig after his nomination for treasure
[2:03:20.920 --> 2:03:27.400]  secretary november 2004 2008 geithner began to insulate himself weeks earlier in anticipation
[2:03:27.400 --> 2:03:32.200]  of his nomination so they take over the government take over the private fellow reserve run the scam
[2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:37.000]  we have goldman sacks own documents he used to work for him paulson was in the treasury department
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:40.840]  former head of goldman sacks setting up this fraud we have their internal documents from
[2:03:40.840 --> 2:03:45.080]  them the clashing newspapers that got them they're setting all this up and then he says oh i'm
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:48.920]  going to get the money and then once i'm in government i'm going to continue the robbery
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:54.280]  but i don't have any decision making in this even though he runs the treasury and the new york fed
[2:03:54.280 --> 2:03:59.720]  the most powerful branch of the fed geithner who was tapped by president barack obama took the
[2:03:59.720 --> 2:04:05.400]  treasury job in january 2009 mark hare spoke for the new york base aig declined to comment
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:15.000]  so the new york fed ordered the cripple insurer not to negotiate for discounts and settling the
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:20.360]  swaps so you have paulson at the treasury and then it continued with geithner the goldman sacks
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:28.440]  hood thug henchman in treasury they got to keep their people in continuing ordering this is another
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.880]  key ordering government policy they're setting government policy to pay a hundred cents on the
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:39.400]  dollar on these fraudulent derivatives they made up out of nothing credit default swaps ensuring
[2:04:39.400 --> 2:04:46.120]  it other systems so they set up the insurance policy they know it's a scam they burn the building down
[2:04:46.120 --> 2:04:52.520]  and collect money off of it they clearly are involved they ran the operation
[2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:58.600]  and this is the key and they set policy for a hundred cents on the dollar this is criminal
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:03.800]  these people are criminals this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the acola blue atmospheric

[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:36.040]  i wanted to get him on we've got wane madson coming up the next hour and a host of other
[2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:42.840]  big scandals will also get his take on bankster gate i'm calling it bankster gate and i want people
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:49.480]  to to understand that this is just like Copenhagen this is just like climate gay if we the alternative
[2:08:49.480 --> 2:08:53.720]  media really point out the full fraud of this force into the mainstream media this could bring
[2:08:53.720 --> 2:08:58.680]  them down we have napolitano on fox saying geithner could be indicted for criminal fraud
[2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:04.280]  we even have ed shoaltz the democrat on msnbc saying the white house is in trouble on this
[2:09:04.280 --> 2:09:09.480]  geithner clearly set policy at the head fed office in new york that's the head office
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:14.680]  he clearly sent policy and continued it as treasury secretary noticed they swapped you had
[2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:19.160]  a geithner in at the private federal reserve while the former head of goldman sacks both
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:25.240]  goldman sacks executives was getting over 200 million for himself and got a waiver from himself
[2:09:25.240 --> 2:09:33.080]  to do it paulson then geithner when paulson left geithner rotated out of the federal reserve
[2:09:33.080 --> 2:09:40.120]  chairmanship of new york into the treasury secretary position here's the key and he continued
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:46.920]  the policy of 100 percent 100 cents on the dollar for fraudulent derivatives that they created
[2:09:46.920 --> 2:09:50.440]  we have the five-part series of mclatchy newspapers with their own internal emails
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:54.920]  where they knew it was fraud knew it was going to implode told people to buy it to blow out
[2:09:54.920 --> 2:10:00.600]  their competition bear sterns lemond brothers and others so they would be left as top dogs
[2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:04.280]  because they had their people all over government so they made money on the way up money on the
[2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:09.480]  way down now webster tarply i've got him on with us i wanted to break this down for geithner to
[2:10:09.480 --> 2:10:16.200]  come out and say like sergeant schultz in hogan's heroes i know nothing i know nothing to have him
[2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:23.640]  saying this is asinine when you have this continue clear racketeering by goldman sacks in government
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:30.520]  out of government webster has always said in both my films last year the key is aig is their front
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:36.680]  holding company to divvy out the goodies worldwide so webster i want you to go through what the
[2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:42.440]  bankers are doing and to explain to them they've stolen the 28 plus trill several trillion of
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:47.880]  that directly from the bailout but now they want the new london kilo land grabbing under fake
[2:10:47.880 --> 2:10:53.400]  environmentalism austerity taxes in australia the same banking group is laying about half the
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:58.440]  land off use just telling farmers get off it's going to the banks i just played a newscast earlier
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:04.920]  no compensation excise taxes sales taxes value added taxes openly going through congress total
[2:11:04.920 --> 2:11:10.360]  raping states going bankrupt being loaned money like their third world countries by the same banks
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:17.240]  the banks won't loan to main street they want the implosion either we expose these frauds
[2:11:17.240 --> 2:11:23.720]  have them indicted expose them audit and then abolish the fellow reserve give the power back
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:30.520]  to congress and have a true package to get the economy going into loan to main street
[2:11:30.520 --> 2:11:35.400]  it's over we're already into the spiral of inflation might as well print as you've said
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:40.120]  i tend to agree with you on that facet you've got the floor i want you to scientifically
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:44.120]  go through the history of this the clear crime where we're going
[2:11:44.840 --> 2:11:50.120]  webster tarpoli economist thank you for joining us thank you alex i would i would propose let's go
[2:11:50.120 --> 2:11:56.200]  back to the to the the issue at the center of these emails and it is the question of derivatives
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:12:02.120]  first of all as you correctly point out financial derivatives paper based on paper side bets on
[2:12:02.120 --> 2:12:09.640]  markets and above all aig the world's largest insurance company that set up during this past
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:17.560]  decade a hedge fund in london a deregulated trading operation in london and of course in london the
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:24.360]  regulatory environment is non-existent there are no rules in london new york is bad london
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:31.720]  is even worse so aig set up a hedge fund in london that issued a total of three trillion
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:37.880]  dollars of the derivatives that's about what one-fifth of the gross domestic product of the united
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:45.240]  states more than the gross domestic product of france so remember derivatives had been completely
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:52.520]  illegal from 1936 until 1980 82 under a new deal law put through by roosevelt derivatives were
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:58.920]  simply illegal and it took a period of several decades of work by phil graham and wendy graham
[2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:05.960]  and alan greenspan and bob rubin and larry summers is in the white house today making policy for
[2:13:05.960 --> 2:13:11.480]  obama to somehow rehabilitate derivatives and bring them back and by the end of all that
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:18.360]  a couple of years ago we had reached the amazing sum of a derivatives bubble in the world of 1.5
[2:13:18.360 --> 2:13:27.400]  quadrillion dollars that is to say 1500 trillion of which three trillion were in this aig hedge fund
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:34.840]  now when this panic started it was clear that aig hedge fund in london aig financial it was called
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:42.040]  they could not pay these were credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations
[2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:48.600]  that connected this london hedge fund of aig to the entire new york london and european
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:56.280]  banking community so in the middle of this crisis in the fall of 2008 we have of course as you
[2:13:56.280 --> 2:14:02.680]  mentioned hank paulson of goldman sacks teaming up with obama and also with mccain and also with
[2:14:02.680 --> 2:14:09.720]  palin because she supported it too to bail out the banking system with 700 billion dollars and
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:15.320]  glenbeck and he's now supporting new taxes to pay the bankers right the entire corporate you know
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:23.480]  globalized pro federal reserve pro wall street gang they're all there cheerleading for for this
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:29.160]  bailout right the tarp the troubled asset relief program which is still still going on so the
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:35.720]  question was then where would this money go and this was kept secret and and that's the issue but
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:41.640]  that's let's jump ahead where did the money go what is it that they're hiding well you mentioned
[2:14:41.640 --> 2:14:51.640]  the sum of about 27 29 billion that is referring to the united states banks that were paid off by
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:57.960]  the aig hedge fund in london thanks to money from the u.s taxpayer so they get the idea is the u.s
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:03.560]  treasury under paulson and then under geithner but under paulson is where it starts they give
[2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:10.600]  the money to um this hedge fund in in london and the new york federal reserve with geithner
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:16.280]  super intends this this process and it goes through something called maiden lane three
[2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:23.560]  and maiden lane three is a company that they set up for the purpose of funneling money to to aig
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:31.400]  so who gets the money uh first of all goldman sacks gets 13 billion dollars uh it's interesting
[2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:37.080]  because at this point the head of aig is a guy called liddy and he's also from goldman sacks
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:42.040]  edliddy from goldman sacks is getting the money from hank paul they've got their people everywhere
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:47.640]  and every administration for over a decade setting up this mother of all heists and they know this
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:52.920]  is goldman sacks alias government sacks so good they've taken over the u.s government in effect
[2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:58.840]  because they've got their their alumni uh all over the place including bob rubin and his protege
[2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:04.520]  than larry summers so goldman sacks gets 13 billion merrill lynch on the way to bankruptcy
[2:16:04.520 --> 2:16:12.760]  and being absorbed gets seven billion bank of america gets 5.2 billion city bank gets 2.3 billion
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:20.760]  guacobia gets 1.5 billion so that's 29 billion to pay off credit default swaps at 100 cents on
[2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:25.640]  the dollar now these credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations were worth
[2:16:25.640 --> 2:16:30.440]  about zero they might have been worth two or three cents on the dollar yeah the banks just made
[2:16:30.440 --> 2:16:36.280]  these up for themselves yeah they're manufactured out of nothing it's basically issuing insurance
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:41.080]  without meeting the uh you know the the legal requirements to issue insurance which include
[2:16:41.080 --> 2:16:46.680]  capital and so forth but now it gets worse we've accounted for about 29 billion so far but there
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:51.240]  are foreign banks it's not just wall street banks not just goldman sacks and we've got 50
[2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:56.360]  billion paid to those and there's evidence that those banks then paid it back into the
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:01.240]  goldman sacks crowd again partly but but yes and and i think that's one of the key motivations
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:07.160]  but let's just give the give the list of criminals in this case we have associate general of france
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:16.200]  gets 12 billion dollars georgia bank of germany gets 12 billion dollars broccoli's bank of great
[2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:24.760]  britain 8.5 billion dollars union bank of switzerland ubs five billion dollars so this is actually more
[2:17:24.760 --> 2:17:32.840]  this is about 38 billion if you put this together we get up to the fantastic sum of 67 billion oh i'm
[2:17:32.840 --> 2:17:39.640]  sorry i thought it was 50 billion 67 billion excuse me billion by my uh by my count which is about
[2:17:39.640 --> 2:17:47.400]  10 percent of the entire tarp 10 percent of the entire trouble assets program goes to goldman sacks
[2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:53.080]  or the partners of goldman sacks and of course we want to stress you know city bank bank of america
[2:17:53.080 --> 2:17:57.720]  these of course are our institutions that are just as evil but if you're running a criminal
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:03.720]  op though you want to use one gang and goldman sacks clearly were the captains of this piratical
[2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:09.480]  fleet yes they they have been able to get more political influence but this this thing is
[2:18:09.480 --> 2:18:16.680]  all intertwined so the idea was then that this should have been stated all of the information
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:21.240]  that i've just gone through the names of these banks and the billions that they got should have
[2:18:21.240 --> 2:18:30.680]  been stated on a filing which aig was legally required to make under the uh securities exchange
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:36.680]  act of 1933 in other words they were supposed to tell the securities and exchange commission
[2:18:36.680 --> 2:18:42.680]  okay sec here's here's the here are the banks that we paid and here's how much we paid them
[2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:51.000]  aig under liddy of goldman sacks sent a first draft of their sec schedule a filing i think it's
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:57.080]  called uh to uh essentially guide those people at the new york federal reserve and the new
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:19:03.560]  york federal reserve and their lawyers told aig don't don't make this public now let's hide this
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:09.000]  for a while let's keep this under wraps because we don't want this to come out and geithner is
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:14.200]  sitting on the top of that institution now so far we don't have as far as i know anyway we don't
[2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:20.040]  have emails that have geithner's name on it but these are all his stuages his underlings his staff
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:25.560]  his appointees people working for geithner and taking orders from geithner did this stuff
[2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:30.520]  and he's using web so we gotta break we'll come back and continue he's using the mafia defense
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:34.280]  of oh that was my underlings that committed these murders so that was my underlings that robbed
[2:19:34.280 --> 2:19:39.720]  these banks he's saying i know nothing though he was setting the policies as the head of the fed
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:46.120]  lobbying forum and then as the head of the treasury department then we have the separate issues of
[2:19:46.120 --> 2:19:52.680]  them selectively using federal regulators they controlled seizing competition banks and then
[2:19:52.680 --> 2:19:57.160]  feeding and dumping all their debt into there i mean there's just so many crimes they're committing

[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:12.360]  host we're going to continue with the scams they pulled then how we prosecute them how we go after
[2:24:12.360 --> 2:24:16.680]  these criminals because they're not going to stop here they're the ones setting up north com they're
[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:21.160]  the ones running the phony environmental movements grabbing the property they openly finance it all
[2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:26.440]  this is the new world order this is the globalist and we say the Anglo-american establishment that's
[2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:32.680]  what they call themselves it doesn't mean white people it means the u.s british elite power axis
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:36.680]  london and wall street i get emails all the time going why are you talking about about
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:43.960]  anglos that's not what it is it means that geographic those cities now webster going back to you
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:49.800]  here you were going through geithner claiming he knows nothing about it though they've got their
[2:24:49.800 --> 2:24:54.280]  people in all the positions they're setting the policies he moves into treasury continues the
[2:24:54.280 --> 2:25:01.160]  hundred cents on the dollar scam and then separately we have them you said at the time and now it's
[2:25:01.160 --> 2:25:06.440]  been confirmed Goldman Sachs was gunning the whole time for Bear Stearns Lehman brothers and others
[2:25:06.440 --> 2:25:12.520]  that they use government power to shut down and eat that's criminal right there i mean it's just
[2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:18.920]  it's all crime yeah that i think the most obvious crime right now is a criminal conspiracy
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:27.080]  with geithner as part of it to violate the securities act of 1933 by deleting information
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:33.560]  that aig had proposed to tell the security and exchange commission and these filings become
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:39.160]  public then here are the banks we gave the money to and here's how much they got uh
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:45.480]  67 billion dollars to these wall street banks london banks and european banks
[2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:52.760]  and the new york fed and their lawyers then said no don't do that now let's uh let's not
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:57.880]  tell that now that's a that's a federal crime right there so we have an obvious overt act we
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:05.000]  have a federal crime uh the falsification of a schedule a filing which is not a matter of choice
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:09.320]  it's something that you've got to do and these things have got to be done in a timely way and
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:16.120]  they've got to be done fully and completely so before we had geithner as a tax sheet uh on
[2:26:16.120 --> 2:26:22.040]  you know really small sums of money but now we're up to almost 70 billion dollars in payments to
[2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:27.640]  bail out a hedge fund a deregulated hedge fund with derivatives which used to be illegal but
[2:26:27.640 --> 2:26:33.640]  which have now been been brought back so there is the need for a special prosecutor we need a
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:40.680]  federal prosecutor right away to go after geithner he should obviously resign or be fired and above
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:46.120]  all we've got to change the uh the policy look at that 70 billion let's call it 70 billion
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:54.760]  that has been given to uh aig the actual amount given to aig by the way is more it's at least 180
[2:26:54.760 --> 2:27:00.040]  billion so it's about a third of the number i've seen in the news is 220 billion 220 billion but
[2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:03.960]  going back going back webster and we'll get into the special prosecutor because that's essential
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:08.760]  everybody needs to listen carefully let's not forget we have record numbers of the obama
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:13.400]  administration that don't even pay taxes you can't work for the irs if you have any previous
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:18.280]  tax problem but here's geithner saying i don't even have to pay because it's some international
[2:27:18.280 --> 2:27:24.040]  money he was making i mean this is just criminals through and through right there this is a this
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:29.400]  is a criminal gang i i would call this the musolini corporate state here here's a good quote
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:35.080]  the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power
[2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:40.120]  to a point where the private power becomes stronger than the democratic state itself
[2:27:40.120 --> 2:27:45.320]  that is the essence of fascism the ownership of government by an individual or a group
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:51.800]  close quote that's frankly rosevelt speaking to congress in 1938 and that's what we have here
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:58.120]  the goldman sacks and and its cohorts in wall street have essentially taken over the u.s government
[2:27:58.120 --> 2:28:03.800]  and they're squeezing it as a cash cow let me hasten to add it's not just goldman sacks i would
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:10.120]  always want to remind people of the morgan's because for 150 years the heart of wall street is
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:19.240]  morgan in other words jp morgan chase the chase Manhattan jp morgan merger they get as much money
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:24.360]  or even more than goldman sacks and they take somewhat less political heat same thing goes
[2:28:24.360 --> 2:28:31.320]  for morgan stanley morgan stanley being that other yeah they're the mob bosses back at the uh
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:36.760]  back at the palace getting the money but the men in there robbing the bank at all the key exits
[2:28:36.760 --> 2:28:41.880]  the gang they hired to rob the bank was goldman sacks right the goldman sacks more you know more
[2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:47.480]  upfront and of course they deserve uh whatever they get so i think it's clear that there's
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:52.440]  been a criminal conspiracy big violations of federal law but here's the here's the big thing i think
[2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:57.880]  you look at uh for example california right or new york state all of these states are now in a
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:03.880]  tremendous budget crisis right are they gonna fire cops are they gonna fire the fire department
[2:29:03.880 --> 2:29:10.840]  nbc reports they're making uh dmv department motor vehicles people work free every friday that's
[2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:16.280]  called slavery yeah well so so here we had 70 billion dollars and really it says you say
[2:29:16.280 --> 2:29:25.800]  it's about 220 billion 200 plus at least billion that were given to aig for what for toxic derivatives
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:31.400]  for garbage for junk paper that's absolutely worthless that doesn't correspond to any kind
[2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:36.200]  of economic wealth or value under the under the okay stay there stay there webster i want to get
[2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:43.000]  into other crimes they've committed and then how people lobby and push to identify the wall street
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:49.400]  criminals as the literal source the fount of all of our economic problems and where we're going if
[2:29:49.400 --> 2:29:57.800]  we don't stop them we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:35:56.040 --> 2:36:01.960]  webster griffin tarply uh webster is really saying nothing new here he's saying what he said in my
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:07.880]  film fall the republic and the obama deception he's going off the facts and it's now being proven
[2:36:07.880 --> 2:36:13.560]  even by the mainstream so webster i want to move quickly now just a bullet points picking your brain
[2:36:13.560 --> 2:36:19.640]  here obviously we need to have a special prosecutor but not just congress we want grand juries at the
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:25.960]  state level to indict we want legislatures that have had their pension funds and other systems
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:32.600]  defrauded by this who have standing to take action we need private suits it is lawsuits that have
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:38.920]  been bringing out the secret aig and goldman sacks documents where they're engaged in fraud and
[2:36:38.920 --> 2:36:44.680]  premeditated plans to blow out their competition and make hundreds of billions of dollars off the
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:51.400]  scam in mclatchy newspapers this is all starting to come out but the public doesn't have a great
[2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:56.760]  knowledge they just know they're being robbed and then i add the point that it's the banks that run
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:02.360]  all our major cities that are lobbying for land grabs and more taxes and surveillance it's the
[2:37:02.360 --> 2:37:07.160]  banks that fund the military industrial complex it's the banks that are pushing the global
[2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:12.840]  Copenhagen tax where we'll pay money directly to them i mean they literally are attempting a global
[2:37:12.840 --> 2:37:21.320]  takeover with this wall of fiat currency 1.5 quadrillion that you talk about or 1,500 trillion
[2:37:22.360 --> 2:37:28.840]  they they are being exposed they are in trouble but let's go over more of their crimes what they've
[2:37:28.840 --> 2:37:36.360]  really done and your expertise in going after these people the best the best ways for people
[2:37:36.360 --> 2:37:41.720]  to call for their indictments and other crimes they've committed so that the public at large is
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:48.440]  aware so they can be pushed into the mainstream media well let's also add another name to our
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:52.840]  list right because so far we've talked about Hank Paulson that was the Bush Goldman Sachs
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:57.400]  uh secretary of the treasury we're obviously focusing on Geithner who went from the new
[2:37:57.400 --> 2:38:02.360]  york fed the flagship of the federal reserve system really the heart of it in terms of policy
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:10.040]  uh but let's also add Sheila Baird uh Sheila Baird of the uh federal deposit insurance corporation
[2:38:10.040 --> 2:38:15.320]  now this woman is also part of the bailout right the bailout comes from the federal reserve under
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:22.760]  Bernanke it comes from the treasury under Paulson and Geithner but then Sheila Baird is the head of
[2:38:22.760 --> 2:38:27.000]  the federal deposit insurance corporation now she did a couple of things we've been talking about how
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:33.160]  sometimes institutions that are viable in themselves are fed into other bankrupt
[2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:37.640]  institutions that are politically better connected the leading example of this is
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:43.560]  Washington Mutual and this was a the largest savings bank left in the United States that
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:50.040]  was simply declared uh bankrupt by the federal deposit insurance corporation and then fed into
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:56.360]  uh JP Morgan Chase in order to prop them up and in other words every indication I have is that
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:03.000]  WAMU Washington Mutual was not bankrupt but of course JP Morgan was because of derivatives JP
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:09.320]  Morgan is the biggest derivatives black hole in the universe so they were this WAMU was seized
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:16.040]  and fed in and the people who had that stock were completely destroyed in the process so that's one
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:21.000]  thing that we want to investigate yeah they didn't pay the people off from that they seized it with
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:27.640]  real assets and then the government regulators run by the JP Morgan Chase slash Goldman Sachs
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:34.360]  pirate crew uh they kept the the money and then didn't even with taxpayer money pay back the people
[2:39:34.360 --> 2:39:39.480]  they'd robbed exactly now if you talked about Bear Stearns Bear Stearns was also fed into JP
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:44.600]  Morgan I think Bear Stearns really was bankrupt several times over with derivatives same story
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:49.480]  from Lehman Brothers which was then allowed to go bankrupt completely but Washington Mutual is a
[2:39:49.480 --> 2:39:54.840]  really egregious case because it's not clear that they were bankrupt at all they were probably viable
[2:39:54.840 --> 2:40:00.040]  and they were fed into JP Morgan to give to give JP Morgan all of those deposits that they could use
[2:40:00.040 --> 2:40:05.320]  to offset some of their toxic derivatives in the long run now the other big thing that Sheila
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:10.680]  Baird does do or doesn't do at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the following
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:18.040]  according to the banking laws of the United States the big banks in Wall Street are bankrupt
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:26.200]  bankrupt bankrupt several times over that means JP Morgan Chase City Bank Bank of America Wells
[2:40:26.200 --> 2:40:33.480]  Fargo a couple of others right Bank of New York Mellon the top six or seven are unquestionably
[2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:40.440]  bankrupt now every Friday you can pick up an AP wire that says today the Federal Deposit Insurance
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:48.360]  Corporation shut down the the corner bank of Podunk Center in some state some little bank
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:54.600]  that nobody's ever heard of with a few hundred million of deposits or assets the problem is
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:41:01.480]  that every Friday we are reminded that Sheila Baird is guilty of a criminal conspiracy not to shut
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:06.280]  down the zombie bank because that's what these things are the big Wall Street banks are zombie
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:11.880]  banks and what I mean by that is this we were told that when the bailout and the tarp went through
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:17.000]  that if you bailed out Wall Street that would help Main Street if you kept the Wall Street banks
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:24.680]  going that would mean abundant credit would flow to companies to industry but they haven't been
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:30.120]  loaning by design they've been shutting down Main Street so they can buy it up right so so what
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:35.640]  we've got is the US taxpayer is now funding zombie banks what the zombie banks do well
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:41.400]  you may have noticed first of all that the price of gasoline has gone up about a dollar per gallon
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:46.440]  in the last 12 months and you predicted that a year ago and what is that that is simply the comeback
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:52.760]  of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley who bid that up to you know almost five dollars a gallon or so
[2:41:52.760 --> 2:41:57.480]  back in the summer of 08 then they had to sell it off when they were threatened by bankruptcy
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:02.280]  and now they're bidding that up again so the thanks you get from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:07.000]  for saving them is that they have they are now bidding up the price of gasoline and they will
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:12.280]  bid that up as high as they can so that's one thing they do parasitical speculation in the
[2:42:12.280 --> 2:42:17.640]  things that you need for your daily life the second thing of course they do is they clip you they
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:26.600]  clip you with late fees deposit fees 30% credit card rates loan sharking but but but what's
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:32.200]  your worst than that they're now lobbying the government to levy all these new taxes on
[2:42:32.200 --> 2:42:39.560]  already broke back country to to then pay them even more money so the government can quote pay off
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:45.400]  debts to central banks we're now hearing that the big banks just last week I saw
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:53.960]  Paulson come out in the news I saw oh who was the other big one I saw
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:43:01.800]  Ruben come out and call for it a bunch of others call for higher taxes to pay off debt
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:06.360]  much of which is debt accrued by giving them all this money so they're in there running the
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:12.200]  government to now rape us financially through taxes exactly and this is this is the whole
[2:43:12.200 --> 2:43:17.640]  secret of obama about one year ago right now obama met with the editorial board of the
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:21.720]  washington post and it's an art it's something that i talk about in surviving the cataclysm
[2:43:22.440 --> 2:43:28.200]  obama said well i know i ran on hope and change but now i have to change i have to abandon those
[2:43:28.200 --> 2:43:33.960]  things now it's going to be sacrifice and responsibility wait a minute wall street has
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:40.680]  just gotten you know 25 trillion whatever it is 27 trillion and now it's time for sacrifice and
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:46.600]  responsibility for the american people exhausted depleted with our living standard cut already
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:52.040]  by two-thirds if you look at what obama wants to do with social security and indeed his his
[2:43:52.040 --> 2:43:58.680]  health care plan these are bailouts in disguise these are bailouts to bail out bankrupt insurance
[2:43:58.680 --> 2:44:03.560]  companies all the insurance companies themselves owned by banks and let me add this that's why
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:08.920]  liberals like deniz kasinich and and even the chairman of the democratic party uh dean have
[2:44:08.920 --> 2:44:14.280]  now read the bill it cuts medicare and medicaid by 40 plus billion dollars a piece every year
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:19.640]  it puts people in jail who can't afford the insurance uh it gives liability protection of
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:24.200]  the insurance companies i went and looked the head lobbyist for the insurance companies admits
[2:44:24.200 --> 2:44:30.200]  they wrote the bill but they give them fake left cover in the media saying insurance companies
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:36.520]  don't want this bill we're socking it to the rich guy and the average moron street level idiot
[2:44:36.520 --> 2:44:41.720]  actually thinks this health care bill is good yes the the obama health care plan as you correctly
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:47.400]  pointed out is first of all it's about 500 billion cut from medicare over a period of years
[2:44:47.400 --> 2:44:53.720]  and the idea with that health bill is that you are forced to buy insurance from a private
[2:44:54.280 --> 2:45:01.560]  for-profit deregulated company which has golden parachutes which has lobbying budgets which has
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:06.760]  30 or 40 percent administrative overhead advertising and the goal of that is that
[2:45:06.760 --> 2:45:12.120]  those companies in their own way are just as bankrupt as aig their insurance companies too
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:17.240]  what did they do they issued derivatives you can look at metropolitan life insurance company
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:22.600]  but also then look at sigma look at the united health care look at all of those and you'll see
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:27.000]  that they're all in the same boat it's just that in this case instead of doing it through the
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:32.440]  federal reserve the treasury and the fdic they want to do it through you that every person
[2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:36.520]  in the united states is required to buy a product from these companies now and that's why their
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:42.360]  stock is all shot up webster so so webster where does it end everything the government does both
[2:45:42.360 --> 2:45:47.880]  parties is a rape of the american people they're openly involved in crime if we don't bring them
[2:45:47.880 --> 2:45:53.320]  to justice they're just going to be emboldened for more more more wasn't kopenhagen a big defeat
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:58.360]  of these people because they openly said fake environmentalism would be their ultimate land
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:03.320]  grab and their carbon tax and a new layer of derivatives aren't they starting to face water
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:08.840]  loo after water loo yes again i think part of that is international my analysis of kopenhagen
[2:46:08.840 --> 2:46:14.120]  was it was the russians who leaked those emails about the east anglia climate research unit
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:19.480]  blew the lid off that and then it was the chinese and their african allies led by sudan
[2:46:19.480 --> 2:46:24.360]  who actually blocked the the thing inside the conference but now let's see what the american
[2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:30.600]  people can do i recommend a march on goldman sacks let's have a march on wall street we've had
[2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:35.560]  these tea party people marching on washington uh... you know that's fine up to a point
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:41.240]  but rather than going for the cape let's go for the matador and the matador is in wall street
[2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:46.520]  the power decisions in this case are all made by wall street and then that is transmitted
[2:46:46.520 --> 2:46:53.240]  that's my that's my analogy we have we have uh... tim geithner is known to have a cell phone and
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:59.960]  he's got his speed dialing set up for two or three institutions for goldman sacks for city bank
[2:46:59.960 --> 2:47:05.400]  and jp morgan chase everybody wants to call jamie diamond at jp morgan chase he wants to call lord
[2:47:05.400 --> 2:47:12.600]  blank fun at goldman sacks and then uh... pandit the bandit the crumb pandit at uh... at city bank
[2:47:12.600 --> 2:47:20.200]  those three that's the state-sponsored compulsory cartel that features in the new musolini fascist
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:26.760]  corporate state but again it's that those those companies own the government they have taken over
[2:47:26.760 --> 2:47:32.040]  the u.s. treasury in the person of a tiny tim geithner now i think it's also
[2:47:32.040 --> 2:47:38.440]  if there's a big groundswell on this the new york post headline of today time for tim to go
[2:47:39.400 --> 2:47:45.160]  this is a neocon newspaper at new york post uh... there have been already rumors last week
[2:47:45.160 --> 2:47:51.320]  when chris dodd quit the senate the word was already then when knowing that that geithner
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:56.680]  was in trouble that god would replace geithner of course that's not enough that would not
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:48:01.640]  be proud you know that's just one wall street stooge replacing another if you look at the
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:06.520]  wall street journal of this morning which i have in front of me here's what they're going with it's
[2:48:06.520 --> 2:48:13.160]  a deception strategy the headline in the wall street journal is bank's brace for bonus fury
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:19.240]  and they have a picture of lord blank fun of goldman sacks and how the public takes the bonuses
[2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:23.640]  but the goldman sacks employees say that the bonuses are not enough and they're not given
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:28.520]  in cash that's not what it's about it's about the crime that was committed yeah the bonuses
[2:48:28.520 --> 2:48:33.240]  i mean the bonuses of course are outrageous and then you know everybody can see that but they
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:39.240]  amount to you know a billion or two at the most whereas we're talking about seven hundred billion
[2:48:39.240 --> 2:48:43.800]  just in the scandal that's at the center of this two hundred and twenty billion as you say around
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:49.160]  that and then it gets up to the twenty seven trillion and then obama will love that he will
[2:48:49.160 --> 2:48:56.200]  use that to control the wages of people across the united states but not of the banks yes so
[2:48:56.200 --> 2:49:01.400]  i think what we need i'd like my recommendation is frankly class consciousness in other words
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:06.600]  we have the people and we have the bankers the people are one thing the people basically the
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:11.640]  middle class and people who'd like to be part of it the bankers are a finance oligarchy
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:17.400]  they're globalized elitists they're you know they have no country they go from barclays to
[2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:23.000]  to deutsche bank to ubs in switzerland uh they don't care about this stuff uh so you've got to
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:29.080]  understand what essentially is the enemy the enemy is the the the financier elite the banks
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:34.520]  in other words they got to fight the they are the source of everything they're the source of the
[2:49:34.520 --> 2:49:40.280]  land grabbing the police state the wars we're going to come back in two segments so this segment
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:45.160]  and one other than another guest joining us wane madson with some big breaking news and take phone
[2:49:45.160 --> 2:49:51.960]  calls from dave john joe sector mark and others uh but webster so much is going on but clearly
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:58.280]  people are finally realizing the real economy is falling apart uh this song and dance about the
[2:49:58.280 --> 2:50:05.160]  economy being better is a fraud uh and the people are waking up to the criminality but we can't just
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:11.240]  let them uh scapegoat geithner we've got to go after the whole system have the congress audit
[2:50:11.240 --> 2:50:17.320]  abolish the fed have the congress under the constitution in its role take over the issuance
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:24.520]  of currency and credit turn it loses an engine of production and power for this society and if we
[2:50:24.520 --> 2:50:29.800]  educate people about the bankers and the scams they engage in and put the controls in there to stop
[2:50:29.800 --> 2:50:35.240]  this we can see a new golden age if we don't the globalists have deindustrialized us they've moved
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:41.080]  everything to china they're in the final phases of their operation it's getting painful so people
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:46.840]  are finally paying attention to who the real enemy is either these scam artist bankers go down

[2:55:20.280 --> 2:55:24.840]  mention one of one of the statement one for our question the other one to uh i'm gonna have to
[2:55:24.840 --> 2:55:29.240]  let you go in just a sec though go ahead okay yeah first off i left a lot of what you're talking
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:35.480]  about and i saw him recently in a european movie called zero um an investigation into nine eleven
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:40.280]  and i've heard very little about this movie zero and i was wondering if like you guys could possibly
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:45.000]  you know help promote it or post it on info wars sure i appreciate your call take care dav you
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:52.520]  know i told you we're taking calls for webster tarpoli i mean come on let's go ahead and take
[2:55:52.520 --> 2:55:58.280]  another call here let's talk to john in florida john you're on the air go ahead uh thank you for
[2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:06.920]  taking my call mr uh tarpoli uh my question has to do with auditing the fed it seems obvious that
[2:56:07.480 --> 2:56:13.320]  the only way to to break the credibility of the current administration and all these people that
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:22.840]  are controlling the world is it to successfully get a passage of the hr-1207 to uh to uncover all
[2:56:22.840 --> 2:56:28.120]  these intricate relationships would you agree and so what's it going to take well i would agree
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:32.840]  but that's only the first step i mean right now but what we've got on the table could take us one
[2:56:32.840 --> 2:56:39.160]  step beyond an audit that is a special prosecutor that would go after bernanke and let me mention
[2:56:39.160 --> 2:56:47.960]  another guy donald cone ko hn in hearings just about a year ago january 13 2009 congressman
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:52.840]  grayson you know him he's a loudmouth democrat from uh from florida i think but doing a good
[2:56:52.840 --> 2:56:57.800]  thing here grayson demanded to know from donald cone of the fed what are the names of the people
[2:56:57.800 --> 2:57:03.560]  who got that aig money and how much did they get will you reveal it and cone said no so let's put
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:08.920]  cone on the list if you could get a special prosecutor going around inside the fed that
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:14.520]  would allow you to do it maybe uh in from another angle of all for auditing the fed but here's the
[2:57:14.520 --> 2:57:19.320]  thing the fed has got to be seized in other words take it out of the control of that yeah it's
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:23.960]  unconstitutional we have under the congress and the president yes we have to put it under the
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:29.800]  congress that's in the constitution and it's simple expose the bankers as the criminals expose
[2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:36.520]  their fraud politically instead of it being obama or palin in this left right diversion
[2:57:36.520 --> 2:57:42.760]  where we then get palin or mit romney or patreas for four years and then people get mad and throw
[2:57:42.760 --> 2:57:47.960]  them out and we got to think about false flag too webster you've been saying all last year and
[2:57:47.960 --> 2:57:53.160]  look at it now clearly the underwear bomber is the kickoff for new false flag they want new wars
[2:57:53.160 --> 2:57:57.800]  well we also had this very interesting thing last monday richard wolf went on the oberman show
[2:57:57.800 --> 2:58:03.480]  and said that the obama white house was convinced that the christmas uh patsey from nigeria that
[2:58:03.480 --> 2:58:10.040]  that was an intentional action uh for various reasons so it means that really the the woke
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:15.560]  network and their false flag operations are very very close to the surface right now obama of course
[2:58:15.560 --> 2:58:21.160]  punted obama turned away didn't do anything obama needs to start firing some people and maybe he
[2:58:21.160 --> 2:58:27.640]  could fire some morals yeah but john thing to demand john your point about auditing the fed being key
[2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:33.720]  you audit it the the treasury needs to be audited all this needs to be public you've got private banks
[2:58:34.840 --> 2:58:40.040]  you've got private banks openly robbing everyone when is it gonna end final calls try to head for

[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:35.320]  situation tell you about the roadblocks i hit and then maybe each of you could maybe help me
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:40.680]  perfect my technique when i make these kind of calls go ahead um i called two network affiliates
[3:00:40.680 --> 3:00:45.720]  here in columbus this morning to ask why there was zero coverage on the geithner story either on the
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:51.000]  air or on their websites neither phone operator even knew who geithner was i had to explain to
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:57.560]  each news desk operator who timothy geithner was um so they gave me the cursor you sure
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:02.840]  we'll take care of it thanks for your call i emailed the cbs affiliate they sent back a
[3:01:02.840 --> 3:01:08.840]  form email saying they'd already covered it once i called senators brown and boinebit boinebitch
[3:01:08.840 --> 3:01:13.560]  spoke with both of their interns uh asked to be there had released a statement on geithner
[3:01:13.560 --> 3:01:18.120]  neither had so i suggested that maybe they would publicly want to distance themselves from such
[3:01:18.120 --> 3:01:22.680]  scum and call for an indictment what you're doing is beautiful call in to talk radio
[3:01:22.680 --> 3:01:29.720]  uh send articles that we write at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com that boils this down send this
[3:01:30.280 --> 3:01:36.680]  to local affiliates send it to radio talk show host we can use the controlled right wingers
[3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:43.160]  thinking they're going after obama to go after the whole banking system and destroy themselves
[3:01:43.160 --> 3:01:49.800]  tarpley i would say in particular that sherry brown right senator sherry brown of ohio makes
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:55.080]  a big thing about being an economic populist and a pro union guy for the working man in the blue
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:01:59.800]  color america keep the heat on sherry brown because this is where you can really squeeze him
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:04.360]  how come he's covering up for geithner and the new york fed and these financial parasites
[3:02:04.920 --> 3:02:09.800]  yeah but i think what joe's doing is excellent keep it up joe be keep it up no make but don't
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:14.280]  give up on sherry brown boinebitch is harder to get because he's on his way out all right thank you
[3:02:14.280 --> 3:02:21.640]  joe gotta jump uh sector i believe in india thanks for holding her on the air yes sir mr
[3:02:21.640 --> 3:02:27.160]  jones mr tarpley great to talk to you got a few suggestions uh i think mr tarpley is right i think
[3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:32.760]  we should all contact uh mr grayson and have him pursue this further and maybe is there any chance
[3:02:32.760 --> 3:02:37.640]  we can get these 18 attorney generals that were interested in the health care sham to maybe go
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:42.440]  off to this also and then also maybe if you could give vince and boogly ocea on and maybe he would
[3:02:42.440 --> 3:02:47.480]  have some suggestions to take these criminals down and uh i started out with the providian
[3:02:47.480 --> 3:02:52.920]  credit card it went to washington mutual and now it's that state and they're charging me 29.9%
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:57.080]  interest i'm trying to get out of as soon as i can we need to rest these criminals
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:03:02.040]  and take him down i thank you and appreciate all that y'all do good job that's the zombie banks
[3:03:02.040 --> 3:03:07.240]  also notice this is why eliot spitzer had to be taken down with that uh with that sex operative
[3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:11.640]  because this is one one guy and there are some other state attorneys general who have the same
[3:03:11.640 --> 3:03:16.840]  profile that they're going to be populist and go after the wall street characters and uh i
[3:03:16.840 --> 3:03:21.080]  thought that's a place we can also begin to put on some pressure yeah they clearly have
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:26.200]  intimidated and destroyed people to send a message to everybody to not stand up but
[3:03:26.200 --> 3:03:32.440]  as the pain gets more and more intense as the abuse and crime becomes more and more transparent
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:39.160]  they're not going to be able to shut everybody up the the positive sign is most these bankers
[3:03:39.160 --> 3:03:46.200]  are buying homes in non extradition countries around the world and clearly are been moving the
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:52.680]  last two years into a fully offshore profile uh with the belief that they may lose total control
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:59.160]  in fact here's bloomberg arming goldman sacks with pistols and it says they're preparing to defend
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:05.880]  themselves from riots and from mobs and preparing to basically evacuate the country so that that
[3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:11.480]  shows they're scared they realize they're criminals and they're now getting the getaway car all warmed
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:17.800]  up and provisioned well there was already a march on goldman sacks a couple of months ago by a bakery
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:23.000]  the stella doro bakery workers who were getting fired because they've been assets stripped and
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:28.360]  looted by by goldman sacks and again i recommend uh we've had enough marches on washington for a
[3:04:28.360 --> 3:04:33.720]  while let's have a march on wall street specifically called goldman sacks i agree we'll get we'll get
[3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:40.280]  we are changing lucrodowski he's in that sector we need everybody to you know set that up and go down
[3:04:40.280 --> 3:04:44.920]  there and let them know that we know they're the problem and see if the police even allow free speech
[3:04:44.920 --> 3:04:48.760]  because they love the bankers so much they're destroying their entire future webster we're

[3:08:42.920 --> 3:08:47.480]  breaking important news every important news up there on capitol hill and at the press club
[3:08:47.480 --> 3:08:52.520]  every day but i wanted to get him on about bankster gate i don't want to just have it be
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:58.200]  timmy gate geithner gate it's much bigger than just him and how the white house has been caught
[3:08:58.200 --> 3:09:02.600]  now clearly lying saying geithner wasn't involved in any of this when he headed the new york fed
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:08.920]  that set the policy and gave the orders and now the treasury marking these toxic uh derivatives
[3:09:08.920 --> 3:09:14.360]  and 100 percent being paid directly to him and others i also want to get into a bunch of other
[3:09:14.360 --> 3:09:21.320]  big news uh that uh wane madson's been working on also what's going on with obama trying to
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:28.120]  block his records uh gag orders going on uh the way they compromise congressman uh and other big
[3:09:28.120 --> 3:09:32.600]  stories he's working on he's always breaking important news that weeks months and years later
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:37.080]  comes out in the mainstream wane madson of wane madson report dot com thanks for joining us
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:45.320]  again good to have you here with us wane uh let's get into uh bankster gate first
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:52.520]  well now we have uh several bankers talking about uh giving themselves big bonuses uh
[3:09:52.520 --> 3:09:59.000]  loy blank find from goldman fax may get the biggest bonus uh among many of the others
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:05.880]  of these bailout banks and uh people are just uh outraged by it all and now we're hearing that
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:13.160]  the next target may be our 401k's and our ira's they make uh the government may want to roll
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:20.040]  those over into annuities which isn't yet another cash grab at money that is belongs to
[3:10:20.040 --> 3:10:26.520]  individual people and in the uh banking overhaul that gave them more power of a month ago
[3:10:26.520 --> 3:10:33.160]  they state that your money markets or your basic savings funds they may seize those those aren't
[3:10:33.160 --> 3:10:39.480]  insured and yes they're going to start taking a percentage of and grabbing your 401k's i mean
[3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:44.840]  they are just getting started in the stealing well and i wonder what you know where the where
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:50.120]  is the american people where they're going to draw the line i mean it's uh this is like a uh
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:57.400]  constantly moving goalpost uh where is the goalpost of absolute outrage where there's no
[3:10:57.400 --> 3:11:02.600]  going back and i don't know what it's going to take the white people up but uh perhaps maybe if
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:08.200]  they see their money disappear maybe that'll do it but you know i'm i'm not i'm not holding out any
[3:11:08.200 --> 3:11:15.320]  hopes because we we don't see the media covering all of this uh of course this thing about the 401k's
[3:11:15.320 --> 3:11:22.360]  and the uh the ira's uh i i got that information from somebody who has very good contacts in the
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:29.240]  treasury department but it's absolutely on the table and uh now we see people like former illinois
[3:11:29.240 --> 3:11:37.640]  governor bulgojevich and former alamone governor siegelman uh complaining about uh obama basically
[3:11:37.640 --> 3:11:43.640]  being in the in the hip pockets of the corporations that uh he's he's really a fake and a phony and
[3:11:43.640 --> 3:11:49.880]  a fraud uh we see um a former new york governor elliott spitzer uh saying that this woman the
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:55.880]  democrats are running for reelection election as senator first person gilla brand is is really
[3:11:55.880 --> 3:12:01.240]  not uh she doesn't have a medal uh to serve in the senate but i think he basically spitzer knows
[3:12:01.240 --> 3:12:07.160]  about the rip off that i think that's why they took him down and i think uh basically any politician
[3:12:07.160 --> 3:12:14.760]  any elected official who's talking about uh what obama and rama manuel and urnaki and the rest of
[3:12:14.760 --> 3:12:21.240]  these crooks are doing uh their phone calls are being intercepted on a daily basis and and and these
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:27.080]  phone calls are being turned over to uh willing prosecutors because they look they they can piece
[3:12:27.080 --> 3:12:33.240]  together any phone call including ours right now and charge us with some sort of a crime well going
[3:12:33.240 --> 3:12:38.760]  back specifically to bankster gate with geithner i mean he's always told congress is the head of the
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:43.720]  new york fed setting policy for the entire system and then his treasury secretary that he won't tell
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:50.040]  people where the money went and that's when the policy of uh the former uh treasury secretary the
[3:12:50.040 --> 3:12:54.760]  former fed chief the current fed chief they're all on record i played clips a few hours ago of him
[3:12:54.760 --> 3:13:00.520]  saying i won't tell you where the money is to now have geithner say okay you got emails from the new
[3:13:00.520 --> 3:13:05.640]  york federal reserve telling aig to not say we're billions of dollars of money was going
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:11.640]  to goldman sacks as bonuses uh and ordering them to lie and keep it off the forms now he's saying
[3:13:11.640 --> 3:13:17.080]  he wasn't involved in that decision i mean we clearly have him in congressional perjury now
[3:13:17.080 --> 3:13:23.320]  we clearly have the white house lying this is bipartisan uh they own both parties i mean where
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:29.240]  does it go well i think uh you know what what what what are we seeing from the congress as far as
[3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:34.600]  as uh oversight we're seeing very very little i think many members that we have a lot of members
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:40.360]  now deciding not to run for uh re-election my sources are telling me people like byron dorgan
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:46.200]  who basically complained about the shipment of u.s jobs overseas he wrote a book called take this
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:54.040]  job and ship it uh and he said in 99 don't get rid of glass steagle right and uh now he's set up
[3:13:54.040 --> 3:13:59.720]  uh he's been he's been pressured by the rama manuel's uh and i think he's just throwing his
[3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:05.880]  hands up and saying look folks it's this this is too much chris dodd of course is in over his head
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:10.600]  with a lot of this and he knows it and and he knows that he he won't be and remember last year
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:15.320]  how the white house said they knew nothing about bonuses when they pressured to have dodd write the
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:21.480]  bill where they could retroactively still get bonuses and were exempt from the new regulations
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:27.400]  on ceo and executive bonuses and then dodd released the email where the white house told him to do it
[3:14:27.400 --> 3:14:32.120]  absolutely and i think that's another reason i that was that dodd is leaving the senate as well
[3:14:32.120 --> 3:14:38.280]  he he got he got used by these people and uh he knows that his career is basically over with now
[3:14:38.280 --> 3:14:45.000]  we can see the hullabaloo about harry reed uh saying that uh you know opama's some sort of a
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:49.400]  uh really you know he's he's the kind of guy that can be all things to all people i think he's
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:55.560]  basically saying the same thing blagojevic is saying the same thing uh about the former governor
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:15:01.480]  seagalman is saying the guy's a phony i mean he's not a progressive he he was he he was elected on
[3:15:01.480 --> 3:15:07.160]  uh basically this late uh he got most of his money from golden sacks and and and the other
[3:15:07.160 --> 3:15:12.920]  bank uh wall street bankers i have to say mccain did too i mean both parties are run by the same
[3:15:12.920 --> 3:15:17.960]  the same conglomerate and so what do we do i mean clearly obama's out in three years uh but then
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:24.520]  the republicans are just as deep into all of this the public starting to figure out that this is a
[3:15:24.520 --> 3:15:31.720]  bipartisan heist uh going on and i guess they're just going to rely on surveillance riot police in
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:39.160]  north com well i think what we again i think what's what we're going to see in 2012 is is uh one of
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:45.000]  those rare opportunities where a true independent candidate for president was a good i gotta have
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:52.840]  an um he or she has to have an immense campaign uh the staff of volunteers uh and uh it could it
[3:15:52.840 --> 3:15:58.440]  could happen it happened almost in 1992 with pro if it was going to be ron paul he'd have to declare
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:03.720]  now and start building the grassroots base but some people say that uh he's too old i mean who
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:08.760]  else is there out there well i think certainly jesse ventures getting a lot of exposure i've
[3:16:08.760 --> 3:16:14.760]  talked to him privately he he he is he is not going to run well you know we always heard that from
[3:16:14.760 --> 3:16:20.280]  other candidates too and uh you know remember perot perot used to say the same thing on larry king
[3:16:20.280 --> 3:16:26.200]  show and he he said but a larry of the people you know want me to run and call this 800 number
[3:16:26.200 --> 3:16:32.520]  and he got enough money of course he decided to get in uh the you know politicians of course
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:37.240]  like to say that they don't want to show their cards it's really like a game of poker uh but
[3:16:37.240 --> 3:16:42.760]  sooner sooner than uh later uh people who may have the intention of running as an independent
[3:16:42.760 --> 3:16:50.040]  are going to have to start putting together a campaign well we'll see what happens on that
[3:16:50.040 --> 3:16:54.600]  front what do you think about congressman issa he obviously doesn't have any skeletons in his
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:59.080]  closet going after the fed or they would have already trotted them out grayson's got a lot of
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:07.080]  courage paul's got a lot of courage uh senator uh of the uh independent uh from connecticut has
[3:17:07.080 --> 3:17:13.240]  got a lot of courage uh we see some others with courage i mean this is this is the elephant in
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:18.920]  the room though how long can this go on i mean i have reports here where goldman sacks is arming
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:24.520]  themselves with weapons against the public and buying homes offshore they clearly know what they've
[3:17:24.520 --> 3:17:29.080]  done i mean how what's the inside scoop in dc you're getting on how far this is going to go
[3:17:29.640 --> 3:17:34.680]  well i i think you meant to say the independent uh bernie uh sanders from vermont the indefense
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:40.840]  on excuse me of course is the horrible and and despicable joe leverman and i'm in connecticut
[3:17:40.840 --> 3:17:46.600]  i meant bernie sanders i i know i know i know you did and you know people like leverman let's
[3:17:46.600 --> 3:17:51.640]  face it i mean these are the types of people that are irritating the constituents out there
[3:17:51.640 --> 3:17:57.320]  um but i i think where where this is going uh this this is an election year we're seeing a lot of
[3:17:57.320 --> 3:18:03.160]  incumbents bailing out uh we're we're gonna see we see a lot of positioning look look the the
[3:18:03.160 --> 3:18:08.200]  corporate democrats want to put this curse thing gilla brand is she was of course appointed to fill
[3:18:08.200 --> 3:18:14.920]  out the hillary clinton's seat uh they want to make her of course uh uh the the elected senator
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:19.160]  from new york but these are these this is what's wrong with the democratic party these but that's
[3:18:19.160 --> 3:18:25.080]  my next issue is democrats at the state and federal level are flip-flopping to republicans
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:31.240]  they're they're leaving en masse they know this healthcare tax the scam this bailout to insurance
[3:18:31.240 --> 3:18:36.440]  companies is unpopular with democrats and republicans but they're so bought and paid for
[3:18:36.440 --> 3:18:41.800]  they're so blackmailed they're still going ahead with it yeah and and you you know there's a lot
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:45.960]  of a lot of you don't see a lot of the party switching that you used to i think people are
[3:18:45.960 --> 3:18:51.480]  just basically the elected people in office are saying the heck with both these parties it
[3:18:51.480 --> 3:18:57.320]  does no good to go from democrat to republican or republicans democrat because both parties are
[3:18:57.320 --> 3:19:02.920]  absolutely corrupt right now uh you know is a third party viable well we've been through all
[3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:08.840]  the third parties a lot my criticism of third parties is there a lot like a they're a parlor
[3:19:08.840 --> 3:19:13.960]  game people like to get together the greens the libertarians they talk about oh what what you know
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:22.120]  what it would be like to uh get it get into office but you know it the actual stamina isn't there
[3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:26.520]  and the money isn't there that's why i think criminal indictments are the way to go we need
[3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:32.200]  to have state grand juries special prosecutors at the federal level we need to see Geithner and the
[3:19:32.200 --> 3:19:36.360]  rest of these guys arrested end it that way and then you've got to deal with the corrupt bought
[3:19:36.360 --> 3:19:42.200]  and paid for judges not only on the federal benches but on the state benches then there's a
[3:19:42.200 --> 3:19:46.920]  there's a slew of them out there yeah that's why we've gotten to this point because the systemic
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:52.840]  corruption like a cesspool has gotten so thick and so deep that we're collapsing like mexico
[3:19:52.840 --> 3:19:57.480]  uh stay there i want to get into a bunch of other news and issues with lane madson our guests

[3:24:31.480 --> 3:24:38.120]  we're going to uh get into blackmail stellar wind it's come out that under the page redact
[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:41.640]  they've been spying on congress people same thing in the parliament in england when people in the
[3:24:41.640 --> 3:24:47.320]  parliament have exposed it they've been raided by the bureaucracy so you have the bureaucracy
[3:24:47.320 --> 3:24:53.560]  taken over the governments and the latest false flag info from the cia bombing in afghanistan
[3:24:53.560 --> 3:24:59.320]  with a triple agent they said uh and a lot more with wane madsen than your calls the last 15 minutes
[3:24:59.320 --> 3:25:03.240]  or so for those that are holding i'm really again honored to always have wane madsen and wane madsen
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:08.920]  report dot com on with us our websites of course our info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[3:25:08.920 --> 3:25:15.800]  okay wane of those four things i mentioned false flag uh blackmail obama's records blackwater
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:20.920]  which one you want to take first well let's talk about the uh the blackmail and and the fact that
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:27.960]  this national security agency program which was once codenamed stellar wind that was a very highly
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:34.280]  uh kept the code work during the bush administration we we knew about it because of some uh leaks that
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:39.720]  came out of the justice department uh fortunately from people that knew it was illegal but it's
[3:25:39.720 --> 3:25:45.320]  since the compromise of stellar wind the code names changed i would love to get the new one but
[3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:50.760]  you know people at the national security agency and other intelligence agencies are basically
[3:25:50.760 --> 3:25:56.760]  running scared because they've got their own internal gishapo uh security people uh trying to
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:03.400]  find out of course who's leaking anything to the media no matter how illegal it is and i would point
[3:26:03.400 --> 3:26:11.000]  out that it's that they're they're first um their first responsibility and loyalty is to the constitution
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:16.840]  and not to any non-disclosure forms they fill out uh many of them know that but they're still they
[3:26:16.840 --> 3:26:23.080]  know they could face jail time and uh loss of their jobs so it's it's a big rip they would take
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:28.520]  however stellar wind is still in practice i understand rama manuel is now using it as
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:32.360]  much as carl rove used it during the bush administration and we've seen that in the news
[3:26:32.360 --> 3:26:37.320]  i mean hints of it that congress people are sick of him calling up and threatening them
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:42.440]  what would he threaten them with well you know if you've got access to people's private conversations
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:47.640]  and emails you would know a lot about their financial situation uh whether they're you know
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:52.920]  their their plans for running for other office for running for reelection things that you know
[3:26:52.920 --> 3:26:58.120]  you you keep in confidence until you make a decision to go public well the manual has all
[3:26:58.120 --> 3:27:04.360]  that information that can be extremely useful in him pressuring members of congress pressuring
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:10.280]  elected governors elected mayors around the country to get on his bandwagon or else and i
[3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:16.760]  understand that has occurred and that largely led to the people like senator dorgan and
[3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:23.160]  govern for ridder of colorado and and and and and and senator dodd deciding deciding to bail
[3:27:23.160 --> 3:27:27.640]  out we may see other people bailing out before this is all said and done because they're just
[3:27:27.640 --> 3:27:33.880]  sick and tired of this this lunatic immanuel who likes to you know bang steak knives onto tables
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:38.200]  and and you know you know you're dead you're dead you're dead and uh you know and he openly
[3:27:38.200 --> 3:27:42.040]  at congressional meetings when obama says something he cracks knuckles and tells him
[3:27:42.040 --> 3:27:47.400]  you know you work for me i mean he he's out of control yeah he's out of control now their
[3:27:47.400 --> 3:27:53.000]  family quinn floated this uh who's married to ben bradley uh the former editor of the
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:58.200]  washington post uh if she's brought this idea that immanuel may leave this job as chief
[3:27:58.200 --> 3:28:03.720]  of staff and run for mayor of chicago now i hear that may just be a straw man a red herring
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:10.360]  but the cover for the he may be leaving because some people want him gone uh but we know that
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:15.960]  many democrats despise this guy immanuel including uh former dnc chairman uh governor
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:21.720]  howard dean uh but uh uh that now i'm under yeah all is not well when the chairman of the
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:27.160]  democratic party says this health care bills a scam right and i understand there's no bad blood
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:33.640]  between immanuel and mayor richard daily of chicago now in that kind of contest i'll bet on
[3:28:33.640 --> 3:28:40.440]  daily to win out uh immanuel maybe in a lot of trouble and he may be just yeah since he's obviously
[3:28:40.440 --> 3:28:45.880]  insane uh he may just be reaching out he does act mentally unstable just when i'm watching him in
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:51.640]  like in the background on a news feed he does act like an insane person yeah and you know
[3:28:51.640 --> 3:28:56.520]  it's like it's you know a trapped wild animal they're gonna lash out so you know be far away
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:29:02.680]  from what he does so so this idea that he he may be threatening daily with running for mayor
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:07.960]  of chicago i think is bravado on his part i think he's looking at the end of his political career
[3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:15.320]  and you know he had designs to eventually become uh speaker the house representatives amazing so
[3:29:15.320 --> 3:29:23.800]  clearly they are threatening and intimidating and using nsa intercepts to get the health care
[3:29:23.800 --> 3:29:29.480]  legislation through and everything else everything else that's on there it doesn't matter and i would
[3:29:29.480 --> 3:29:35.000]  say this even plays in uh to the middle east policy now which mitchell has threatened israel
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:40.520]  with cut off of their loan guarantees and i i would bet that mitchell's uh phone call transcripts
[3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:47.240]  are now fitting into some manual all right let's look into obama's cia background blocking his bia
[3:29:48.280 --> 3:29:53.160]  information and then we'll get into false flag and black water big developments there with wane

[3:35:11.080 --> 3:35:17.160]  and don't forget our guest Wayne Madsen a lot of stuff on this site is free and he is a pundit
[3:35:17.160 --> 3:35:22.840]  on international television writes for major publications but a lot of incredibly amazing
[3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:30.360]  information is available for subscribers at WayneMadsenReport.com okay Wayne let's get into Obama
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:36.680]  and his records now almost a year into his administration were two years into people trying
[3:35:36.680 --> 3:35:43.160]  to get him no presidents college records business records the first jobs he had this is treated
[3:35:43.160 --> 3:35:49.720]  as a matter of national security and we know he's connected into BIA which was a known CIA front
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:58.520]  let's talk about Barack Obama well we have to go back in time to 1981 when Barack Obama was known
[3:35:58.520 --> 3:36:08.600]  as Barry Satoro his mother and Dunham had remarried an Indonesian man and they had moved to Jakarta
[3:36:08.600 --> 3:36:16.440]  now Obama in those days was traveling on a Pakistani passport under the name of Barry Satoro
[3:36:16.440 --> 3:36:24.200]  he went to Pakistan in 1981 and was hosted by the family of Muhammad beyond Sunro who
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:30.920]  believe it or not became president of Pakistan after the resignation of General Mushara
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:38.680]  in 2008 so this was the family obviously a family that was very close to the CIA at the time because
[3:36:38.680 --> 3:36:44.520]  we have to remember what was going on in Pakistan in 80 and 81 for Zinski then followed by the
[3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:50.680]  rake in administration Bill Casey of the CIA was of using Pakistan as the main base for the
[3:36:50.680 --> 3:36:57.640]  Afghan Mujahideen war against the Soviets who had invaded Afghanistan so this was a hotbed
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:37:05.240]  of CIA activity Obama or Satoro apparently went partridge hunting with the Sumeros
[3:37:06.600 --> 3:37:12.520]  and this is what the claim is anyway I understand he also traveled into India across the
[3:37:12.520 --> 3:37:21.640]  Pakistan-India border what he did in India is anyone's guess so we have basically someone who
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:29.880]  was traveling to Pakistan whose stepfather Lolo Satoro was an Indonesian military officer who
[3:37:29.880 --> 3:37:36.680]  helped Soharto take power in a military coup and General Soharto was basically run by the CIA
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:44.600]  Obama's mother and Dunham was with the Ford Foundation and USAID USAID is a known
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:49.800]  Cypher for Central Intelligence Agency activities around the world she was in
[3:37:49.800 --> 3:37:55.480]  what were Pakistan at the same time her son was and we do know that
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:38:01.560]  Obama after graduating from Columbia went to work for Business International Corporation
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:07.480]  which was a documented CIA front activity and he was involved in publishing two
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:17.800]  newsletters excuse me financing foreign operations and Business International Money Report
[3:38:20.200 --> 3:38:22.760]  yeah take some time out there and drink a glass of water
[3:38:23.640 --> 3:38:30.360]  Wayne Madsen and so Obama from the beginning Foundation, CIA, Iran and they're blocking
[3:38:30.360 --> 3:38:35.880]  the release of these records there is no doubt this guy has been groomed for big things from
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:42.200]  the very start we now see what that is left cover to come in and convince the left to go
[3:38:42.200 --> 3:38:49.800]  along with the new world order please continue Wayne Madsen well as I said we have a we have
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:59.480]  a president with this these obvious holes in his in his background and we have a president who
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:06.360]  is refusing to disclose his transcripts from both Occidental in Los Angeles where he was an
[3:39:06.360 --> 3:39:15.080]  undergraduate and from Columbia where he finished up his undergraduate work before he went to
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:21.000]  law school at Harvard University why why won't he release those records
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:29.480]  we know this he's a fully compromised individual and in a world of black ops
[3:39:29.480 --> 3:39:34.600]  in a world of shadow government they wouldn't let him into any sort of power if he wasn't fully
[3:39:34.600 --> 3:39:42.120]  compromised well I believe this is the idea this is uh this is what people are fearful of we you
[3:39:42.120 --> 3:39:47.720]  know we we had a problem with George W. Bush because remember he said anything in his early
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:53.960]  youth uh was off the table then later we found out he was you know busted for cocaine possession
[3:39:53.960 --> 3:40:01.000]  and you know he was uh he was basically a drunk uh I had problems with DWI and and but you know
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:07.320]  these these this information we had some records of just from arrest records if anything else but
[3:40:07.320 --> 3:40:16.280]  with Obama we have basically this this uh a concerted effort to keep these what should be records
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:23.800]  in the public domain secret and anytime the system wants to torpedo Obama if he ever gets
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:29.720]  out of line they've got this mausoleum full of skeletons to bring him to his knees shifting
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:35.640]  gears to false flag terror with the underwear bomber new developments there with your intel
[3:40:35.640 --> 3:40:43.160]  sources uh and expanding on that as well the false flag event you were telling me during the break
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:49.880]  and I've also seen this in the news the residue of the bombing of the CIA uh command base uh
[3:40:51.720 --> 3:40:58.280]  having the residue of Pakistani ISI well we we know and now it's being reported in the Indian
[3:40:58.280 --> 3:41:06.760]  press that a forward based cabinet um which uh was where the bomb went off the residue
[3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:15.560]  who shows that it was from Pakistani ISI known previous bombing so nothing happens
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:25.240]  uh with the ISI without the CIA knowing about it so why would that be done kind of like a
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:31.720]  pentagon attack or a ford hood event to get the military all riled up and in support of retaliatory
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:41.000]  and expanses uh expanding events military uh uh sorties into Pakistan well we know even prior
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:47.560]  to the bombing and cost that one of the generals over there was uh saying that the whole US intelligence
[3:41:47.560 --> 3:41:54.840]  operations in Afghanistan were totally messed up there was a big morale problem so what better
[3:41:54.840 --> 3:42:04.360]  than to have an attack against the CIA base uh to uh basically uh you know bang the drums for
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:12.760]  reprisal attacks uh you know we now know that this guy was a triple agent um he was well known as a
[3:42:12.760 --> 3:42:20.040]  jihadi website blogger we're told but he was basically uh in press ganged into service with
[3:42:20.040 --> 3:42:26.600]  the jordanian intelligence service by uh a distant relative of the jordanian royal family
[3:42:27.480 --> 3:42:34.600]  so let me let me ask you this go ahead go ahead no i mean i mean add to that point and then i
[3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:41.560]  have another question oh well as so we we have this officer jordanian officer sherry who brings
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:48.360]  this guy the law we into the into the cia employment in afghanistan and where was the vetting the
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:55.960]  vetting now we find out that some of the residue explodes the material at camp camp Chapman was from
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:43:03.960]  ISI sources uh you know was this was was this the CIA sacrificing some of its own agents
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:08.680]  to push a political agenda which would make it yet another one of these false flag attacks
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:17.880]  well we know the MO of these people always shows this uh going back to blackwater going back to the
[3:43:17.880 --> 3:43:24.440]  white house trying to persecute reporters and their sources what you said literally five years ago
[3:43:24.440 --> 3:43:29.800]  what tarply said what many others said five six years ago has now been confirmed that blackwater
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:34.360]  was running hit teams they say they were themselves they were just a few years ago they threatened
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:39.560]  to sue you if you said that now they're just out in the open admitting they're running hit teams
[3:43:39.560 --> 3:43:46.280]  all over the world all this corruption coming out of blackwater blackwater set to get a billion
[3:43:46.280 --> 3:43:53.960]  dollar contract uh obama is fully embracing them uh i i want your comment on that and then
[3:43:53.960 --> 3:44:02.520]  secondarily i ended up getting contacted uh by somebody who said that colonel anthony shaffer
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:08.760]  wanted to be on the show of able danger and and then he came on and said i agree with a 9 11
[3:44:08.760 --> 3:44:13.240]  investigation i agree with people that think something's going on here i can't tell you
[3:44:13.240 --> 3:44:18.520]  everything i know but the government allowed these attacks to happen and they wouldn't let us go after
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:25.080]  al-qaeda because they they want their own private army blackwater and others and and so they don't
[3:44:25.080 --> 3:44:31.080]  want our own army going after these people so what's going on with blackwater right now a and then
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:37.000]  b what do you think of what shaffer has to say tying it into sable edmunds well i i definitely
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:43.640]  think that the blackwater is uh was basically used as a cia proprietary eric prince of course
[3:44:43.640 --> 3:44:49.720]  already had a lot of money he inherited from his father edgar prince of big um automotive uh
[3:44:50.600 --> 3:44:57.720]  uh tycoon um so there was money already there and and prince comes along sets up this operation
[3:44:58.600 --> 3:45:06.040]  the cia uses it prince hires a lot of former cia officials uh into blackwater uh then he's doing
[3:45:06.040 --> 3:45:12.200]  these tough piece interviews for vanity fair he's really looking for sympathy i think what he's doing
[3:45:12.200 --> 3:45:18.840]  is graymailing he's graymailing the cia saying look if you continue to allow me to be prosecuted
[3:45:18.840 --> 3:45:25.480]  or threaten prosecution my employees to be prosecuted lawsuits i'm in a position to expose
[3:45:25.480 --> 3:45:31.640]  a lot more than i was just trying to kill some guy in hamburg and a q con in pakistan and running
[3:45:31.640 --> 3:45:36.200]  other hit squad and then he ups the ante and says giving a billion dollar contract exactly
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:40.760]  and this is what he's doing this is called graymailing oliver north did it during his trial
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:44.760]  that's why they threw every all the charges out against north because he was in a position to
[3:45:44.760 --> 3:45:50.680]  bring down the reagan administration it's really the same thing here it's the same tactic being used
[3:45:50.680 --> 3:45:57.080]  and and princes is using it i would say with a lot of uh advice from uh people at the cia
[3:45:57.080 --> 3:46:05.720]  you know urging him on you know uh you know we want you uh to be out there to uh make these
[3:46:05.720 --> 3:46:13.400]  graymail threats so our other covert operations can be uh safe and secure and he's not worried
[3:46:13.400 --> 3:46:20.520]  about having a kayak accident i don't think so i i mean uh i think princes and is is basically
[3:46:20.520 --> 3:46:26.520]  doing this with a wink and a nod from people in the cia because he knows that the members of
[3:46:26.520 --> 3:46:31.320]  congress the intelligence oversight committees are going to get the message loud and clear about
[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:36.520]  graymailing and so is the obama administration hence we see that they're prepared to give them
[3:46:36.520 --> 3:46:41.320]  this big contract to train the afghan and notice now it doesn't matter how many of his employees
[3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:47.000]  get indicted how bad it gets they say black water is suddenly wonderful again that's right and what
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:53.080]  we know about their activities uh i see judge ps l is here in the eastern uh district of virginia
[3:46:53.080 --> 3:46:59.000]  what's known as the cia rocket docket and alexandria threw out the lawsuits against uh black water but
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:03.240]  they said that there was a john doe two and a john doe one former black water employee that said
[3:47:03.240 --> 3:47:08.520]  this company was involved involved in everything from child prostitution attack evasion to money
[3:47:08.520 --> 3:47:13.560]  laundering to drug smuggling to weapon smuggling you name it this company was involved with it
[3:47:13.560 --> 3:47:19.400]  and of course prince knows that and that's why why he's black and basically graymailing i call
[3:47:19.400 --> 3:47:24.520]  blackmail i think they're gonna let them off the let them off the hook by calling it graymailing
[3:47:24.520 --> 3:47:29.400]  but blackmail is illegal so he's going to get you know he's graymailing the government and saying
[3:47:29.400 --> 3:47:36.360]  look i i can release even more if you uh if you just as department lawyers want to play games with
[3:47:36.360 --> 3:47:45.000]  me and clearly the army is in a turf war they don't like black water no and most most uniform
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:50.600]  people don't not only because of the wage uh there's a disparity between the low wages paid to our
[3:47:50.600 --> 3:47:56.840]  military uniform the personnel as opposed to the the money that the black waters of the world make
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:03.320]  but also the fact is when these when these uh mercenaries the inner civilian guard uh commit
[3:48:03.320 --> 3:48:09.400]  an atrocity um you know that the retaliation people are going to look for the guys wearing the
[3:48:09.400 --> 3:48:14.680]  american patch on their uniform and they're the ones who are going to get to get retaliated against
[3:48:14.680 --> 3:48:21.480]  and the uniformed personnel are sick and tired of being uh being uh uh the targets for atrocities
[3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:29.000]  committed by these mercenaries like black water and and the others out there and um i i've i've
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:36.040]  been told this by people actually long before uh iraq and afghanistan when when some of these
[3:48:36.040 --> 3:48:41.800]  mercenaries were starting to show up in africa uh the uniformed officers were telling me that they
[3:48:41.800 --> 3:48:47.160]  despise the the presence of these people underground look at what sybil edmund says she got she was
[3:48:47.160 --> 3:48:54.120]  listening to the fbi intercepts at the fbi and it was the cia involved in child kidnapping
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:49:00.600]  involved in narcotics trafficking uh and and and i mean these people are just pure evil uh let's
[3:49:00.600 --> 3:49:05.400]  take a call or two here let's talk to mark and georgia you're on the air with wane madson go ahead
[3:49:05.400 --> 3:49:12.440]  mark uh hi god bless you you're ever in our prayers i guess i've used that one a few times um this may
[3:49:12.440 --> 3:49:19.000]  be a bit off topic um farat and is the greek word that's translated as beast in revelation 13
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:24.760]  i believe we're looking at the rider with the scales which when people are hungry and homeless
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:32.280]  and desperate they may do things that they would not otherwise do um i think we need to recognize
[3:49:32.280 --> 3:49:37.960]  that this system is not merely corporeal and and i i understand you're getting upset about
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:42.680]  things that people have said before that sounds defeatist all i think we want to clarify every
[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:48.520]  pocket of resistance that does not ballot to the beast is a victory and they're mark i appreciate
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:53.320]  your call i appreciate your call and i'm going for questions here for wane madson uh paul and

[3:50:05.880 --> 3:50:11.880]  um you might say this is immoral but i certainly don't think it should be criminal um i'm a racist
[3:50:13.160 --> 3:50:19.080]  and i have severe concerns about that when i walk down the street one day and look at a black person
[3:50:19.080 --> 3:50:23.560]  hostily uh i want to get arrested all right let me let me stop and get a comment from wane
[3:50:24.280 --> 3:50:29.000]  this is all quackery what they do is they say these defense companies make money off the body
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:34.040]  scanners now they say brain scanners it's like lie detectors it's just a new quack machine to say
[3:50:34.040 --> 3:50:39.480]  you're guilty wane madson i wonder i just wonder how much money michael chair top who's got a
[3:50:39.480 --> 3:50:44.440]  financial stake in the uh body scanners as in these brain scanning machines i understand
[3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:50.120]  homeland security is considering them uh it should be stated that uh chair top still is a
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:55.880]  paid consultant to janet napolitano the home homeland security secretary just like uh john
[3:50:55.880 --> 3:51:00.920]  negroponte is still consulting over at the state department these are outrageous more outrageous

[3:54:37.880 --> 3:54:42.200]  throughout the week with more extremely powerful and informative guests i'm just going to leave
[3:54:42.200 --> 3:54:47.720]  it at that for you this week we got some giant groundbreaking guests lined up here on the show
[3:54:48.280 --> 3:54:52.760]  michael in illinois you're on the air with wane madson and wane madson report dot com go ahead michael
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:55:00.600]  hey guys cool um god bless first of all i want to ask about the the whole fed audit situation and
[3:55:00.600 --> 3:55:06.040]  what makes you guys think that if there is an audit we've seen the length these guys will go to cover
[3:55:06.040 --> 3:55:12.040]  their tracks okay nothing's perfect but we're identifying the bankers as the oligarchy and
[3:55:12.040 --> 3:55:17.400]  congress has the purview to run our banking system and our currency and credit and so we
[3:55:17.400 --> 3:55:22.840]  want it back to congress because at least it's public and accountable wane madson well certainly
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:28.120]  anytime you have an audit of anything you're going to be able to get documentation it's
[3:55:28.120 --> 3:55:34.520]  it's the same thing why i i i favor civilian trials of these so-called terrorists uh uh
[3:55:34.520 --> 3:55:39.160]  because uh through discovery and cross examination we're going to get a lot more information
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:44.680]  about who they're working for and their networks then we could could would get from a military
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:49.640]  tribunal same thing with an audit by congress we're going to get a lot more information
[3:55:49.640 --> 3:55:54.440]  and documentation about who the the real criminals are and it's in this bank uh
[3:55:54.440 --> 3:55:59.560]  bank fraud that we well wane i mean the spin out there has been don't audit the fed they'll win if
[3:55:59.560 --> 3:56:05.960]  you do the fed is fighting with everything they've got to not be audited and i mean michael what are
[3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:09.960]  you what are you getting at we just let them continue on we don't audit them we don't try to
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:15.960]  abolish them i think criminal i think we should go after them criminally like you said um i i agree
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:24.120]  but an audit an audit will will get them criminally wane absolutely you have to you have to get the
[3:56:24.120 --> 3:56:31.480]  documentation you know before the ira ira besides to invite somebody for tax fraud they order them
[3:56:31.480 --> 3:56:36.040]  so it's the same thing here with the federal reserve you can't just say they've committed
[3:56:36.040 --> 3:56:40.760]  criminal acts without you've got to have evidence and and you only can get that kind of evidence
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:45.800]  because we're feeling in very complicated financial systems you're only going to get that evidence
[3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:50.520]  through an audit but i mean michael i understand your point you want something more but ron paul has
[3:56:50.520 --> 3:56:55.640]  said you audit the fed you abolish them they we know all the fraud they've engaged in once we
[3:56:55.640 --> 3:57:01.400]  have it all look at geithner in these emails he's about to go under believe me we want it all don't
[3:57:01.400 --> 3:57:07.560]  we wane absolutely absolutely but you've got to start you got to start uh somewhere in an
[3:57:07.560 --> 3:57:12.520]  audit sounds perfectly reasonable and notice for for for two years the fed fighting an audit
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:16.440]  and now starting to lose that makes them look really guilty doesn't it wane the fact that
[3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:22.360]  they're like no no no no don't look don't look well if they act like they've got something behind
[3:57:22.360 --> 3:57:29.880]  they probably do michael anything else yeah if you said obama is compromised and obviously is
[3:57:29.880 --> 3:57:35.000]  is what are the what is the likelihood that he's been set up to take a fall no matter what if there's
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:40.360]  too much heat that comes uh comes i agree they always flush presidents down the toilet that's
[3:57:40.360 --> 3:57:45.560]  why we point out when he was powerful in a rock star he was a betrayer and my films that wane
[3:57:45.560 --> 3:57:49.880]  is in fall the republic we say now look out it's the next guy you got to worry about
[3:57:51.880 --> 3:57:57.640]  all right and we saw that with jimmy carter how they how they basically used him and you know
