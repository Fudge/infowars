[00:00.000 --> 00:11.180]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.180 --> 00:18.720]  so does he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.720 --> 00:29.000]  Texas Alex Jones all right ladies and gentlemen I just got off the phone with
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.240]  Dave Mustaine literally 20 seconds ago and so I'm gonna have to just give these
[00:35.240 --> 00:42.880]  directives here to my folks live on air come on in I need to I need to talk to
[00:42.880 --> 00:45.440]  you as soon as we go to break because Dave Mustaine is gonna put a statement
[00:45.440 --> 00:49.760]  out through us I didn't really press him to do that he just wants to put a
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.400]  statement out through us I'm sure you've seen the 500 articles ABC CBS everything
[00:54.400 --> 00:58.760]  New York Daily News about his comments in over in Asia he got back a couple days
[00:58.760 --> 01:04.600]  ago to the US about the shootings could be staged by Obama and they're taking
[01:04.600 --> 01:09.600]  them out of context to making a big deal out of it so we need to get that clip
[01:09.600 --> 01:13.420]  because it was you put together that radio interview right and you know the
[01:13.420 --> 01:16.520]  clip I didn't put out just because I didn't want to you know it'd been that
[01:16.520 --> 01:20.960]  big national news I just kind of made that decision myself if I do anything I
[01:20.960 --> 01:26.160]  hold back sometimes people think I exaggerate get that clip ready and I've
[01:26.160 --> 01:32.000]  got to I've been talking to Dave he's he's gonna send me his statement so get
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.720]  Watson on the horn so that we can put his statement into a blurb and then put
[01:37.720 --> 01:41.280]  under it the Larry Pratt thing because you know Larry Pratt had the second
[01:41.280 --> 01:44.760]  biggest gun group in the country who's never talked like us said yeah they
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.520]  stage fast and furious is a false flag they stage these and you've got you know
[01:48.520 --> 01:53.040]  that's what Dave's saying is you know they they took him on stage and kind of
[01:53.040 --> 01:57.040]  edited it out of context and he just wants to be clear in fact we got two
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.960]  guests coming up today and Dave's got some recording stuff that was already
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.320]  set so he has to go in and do that but then he's probably gonna be on later
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.680]  after the show today we'll have that for the night we news but right now we just
[02:10.680 --> 02:14.360]  want to get this statement out started calling me yesterday afternoon before I
[02:14.360 --> 02:18.320]  got back to the office and we weren't sure how big a deal it would be but
[02:18.320 --> 02:21.800]  they're definitely freaking out about it most people are supporting him though
[02:21.800 --> 02:25.080]  because hey government does stage this stuff and it has all the telltale signs
[02:25.080 --> 02:29.240]  reports of four shooters all of it he wasn't entirely convinced the first
[02:29.240 --> 02:32.360]  Batman deal despite all the anomalies but when he saw the clips in the news
[02:32.360 --> 02:39.240]  about people saying they saw multiple shooters and all the rest of it yeah
[02:39.240 --> 02:43.960]  absolutely when they in the second gas mask and and the people being told to
[02:43.960 --> 02:47.040]  shut up and then the reports of people casing it and then you've got white
[02:47.040 --> 02:50.600]  supremacists that are so infiltrated and and and all the gun bills introduced
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.840]  right now my point is is I just need to brainstorm that now so I didn't forget
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.960]  it just just get Watson and I was calling him Dave called me I called him
[03:00.960 --> 03:04.280]  back and I was calling Watson he wasn't answering he's in England folks just
[03:04.280 --> 03:08.840]  tuning in our only crew not here at the command center now is in England Paul
[03:08.840 --> 03:13.880]  Watson and Steve Watson brothers and so I just want to codify an article about
[03:13.880 --> 03:20.680]  Dave Mustaine released a statement on seek situation seek shooting and then
[03:20.680 --> 03:24.400]  we'll just have but but here's the here's the issue I've got to give Paul
[03:24.400 --> 03:28.560]  Dave's email because he sent me text with his statement but we need to make
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.720]  sure it's codified right because get to be a text he approves it then we put it
[03:32.720 --> 03:38.480]  out all right I don't want to lose any time on this show that's basically it
[03:38.480 --> 03:46.120]  thanks a lot buddy okay we got a big show lined up today as well obviously we've
[03:46.120 --> 03:53.040]  got Gerald Salente Gerald Salente is on the broadcast always in
[03:53.040 --> 03:57.120]  form of dealing with this admission of global meltdown accelerating and I'm
[03:57.120 --> 04:00.800]  really excited about this Richard Belzer has written a book dealing with
[04:00.800 --> 04:04.680]  government cover-ups government shootings that were blamed on patsy's

[04:33.880 --> 04:37.760]  this much breaking news I'd move a guess like that but it's perfect timing so we'll
[04:37.760 --> 04:41.980]  go over other past events why we when there's motive when there's the telltale
[04:41.980 --> 04:45.560]  signs why we look at the usual suspects who've been caught doing this stuff
[04:45.560 --> 04:50.600]  before so that's all coming up guys I don't seem to have any news on the Dave

[08:05.760 --> 08:17.600]  information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we have
[08:17.600 --> 08:23.000]  Gerald Salente on this Thursday edition joining us in T-minus 53 minutes from
[08:23.000 --> 08:30.920]  now then we have TV host big-time actor and author Richard Belzer who's written
[08:30.920 --> 08:34.520]  a new book dealing with government staging mass shootings and assassinations
[08:34.520 --> 08:39.480]  and blaming it on their political enemies dead wrongs the book by Sky Horse
[08:39.480 --> 08:44.520]  Publishing forward by Jesse Ventura nice timing we've had this set up for two
[08:44.520 --> 08:50.160]  weeks to have him on as I know you've probably noticed it's on every TV
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.440]  station out there that I've seen the local radio was covering it national
[08:54.440 --> 09:00.520]  radio you name it it's being covered hundreds of newspapers Dave Mustaine was
[09:00.520 --> 09:06.640]  in Asia a few days ago he's now back in California formerly of Metallica of
[09:06.640 --> 09:14.120]  course founder of Megadeth and Dave Mustaine talked about the fact that he
[09:14.120 --> 09:19.400]  thinks Obama may have staged the shootings to get our guns and bringing a
[09:19.400 --> 09:24.400]  police state in Aurora and in Wisconsin so in Colorado and there and it's a big
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.440]  national story right now also the writings on the wall they're getting
[09:28.440 --> 09:33.120]  ready to dump Biden right now because of his thing about black people are gonna
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.080]  be put back in chains if Romney gets elected so that's big news that's
[09:37.080 --> 09:47.280]  coming up but Dave and I were talking yesterday about it Dave called me right
[09:47.280 --> 09:51.720]  before the show started and he's writing up a statement and we're gonna release
[09:51.720 --> 09:59.560]  it at infowars.com in the next hour or so also not sure if Dave wants to
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.320]  release it but we have you know we did a recording as well with him basically
[10:04.320 --> 10:07.880]  just saying look if they stage fast and furious they'd say anything same thing
[10:07.880 --> 10:14.760]  Larry Pratt said so that's all the clarification it is a big story they're
[10:14.760 --> 10:18.640]  scared of this if people just stop buying whenever the system says it's over
[10:18.640 --> 10:22.640]  their little game is over and they don't like it and love Dave or hate Dave I
[10:22.640 --> 10:26.680]  know him personally now for about five years and he stayed at my house quite a
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.120]  few times family friends with him I can tell you right now he's he's the real
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.080]  deal he's a real guy and he's really starting to wake up to the full big
[10:35.080 --> 10:43.560]  picture of what's going on so this is a big story and again he's got
[10:43.560 --> 10:48.600]  commitments he's recording right now just drop his daughter off at school he
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.360]  is recording right now for the next four or five hours but after the show
[10:52.360 --> 10:59.440]  today we'll probably do a taping I'm scheduled to take my children somewhere
[10:59.440 --> 11:02.400]  and then come back tonight but whatever has to happen we'll get that out for you
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.200]  today and there'll be a statement coming up very very soon here huge economic
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.840]  news giant news on the on the WikiLeaks front the attack on the family research
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.920]  council not being called terrorism Obama isn't making statements on somebody
[11:16.920 --> 11:20.640]  saying he was mad about Chick-fil-A and Christians they went there and shot some
[11:20.640 --> 11:26.000]  people and I guess it's a big celebration so there you go
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.360]  of course people with guns were able to stop him continuing we're going to be
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.000]  looking at all of that and some big federal court rulings warrantless
[11:37.000 --> 11:45.720]  cell phone tracking is illegal federal court rules now I wanted to air this
[11:45.720 --> 11:59.200]  yesterday but the show just got just got filled up but we're gonna air this now
[11:59.200 --> 12:07.240]  this is Paul Watson's breakdown of parallels between our society and Rome and
[12:07.240 --> 12:11.000]  so we're gonna air this piece from info wars nightly news a few nights ago and
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.680]  then we're going to go to break and come back and get into all of the
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.320]  incredible news I'm Alex Jones here is an excerpt of Paul Joseph Watson info
[12:18.320 --> 12:22.520]  wars nightly news the parallels again between our Republic turned into an
[12:22.520 --> 12:26.320]  empire the same thing that happened to the Roman Empire this is key information
[12:26.320 --> 12:30.840]  stay with us Rome burned will we and this is an article I put together with
[12:30.840 --> 12:35.920]  Alex Jones as America's engineered economic implosion accelerates the
[12:35.920 --> 12:41.560]  parallels with how the Roman Empire fell are staggering America is now ruled by a
[12:41.560 --> 12:46.440]  gaggle of completely corrupt financial terrorists who will stop at nothing to
[12:46.440 --> 12:51.000]  hollow out the country and pursue their own maniacal and selfish gain this
[12:51.000 --> 12:55.960]  precisely parallels Rome's rapacious ruling emperors and senators of the
[12:55.960 --> 13:01.640]  fifth century it was so obsessed with seizing wealth and control that they
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.680]  ended up destroying their own culture their own country and the whole empire
[13:05.680 --> 13:11.080]  in the process so basically this is mainly about the planned financial
[13:11.080 --> 13:15.160]  implosion with of course the so-called stress tests on the banks coming up the
[13:15.160 --> 13:19.200]  banks have been told by the Federal Reserve prepare for a collapse and the
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.280]  government's not gonna help you but it's also about the innumerable similarities
[13:24.280 --> 13:29.920]  that 21st century America shares with the Roman Empire and it's just amazing
[13:29.920 --> 13:34.760]  how close they parallel how close they match up you know we've got the United
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.760]  States with troops stationed in some 130 countries now outstripping anything
[13:40.760 --> 13:46.080]  the Romans ever had in terms of occupation but of course sharing the same
[13:46.080 --> 13:51.760]  impossible task of maintaining such a sprawling empire when the US can't
[13:51.760 --> 13:57.000]  afford it's gone bankrupt 16 trillion in debt meanwhile we've got the you know
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.760]  the ruling greedy elite centralizing power and wealth capitalizing hijacking
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.000]  the very financial crisis they created to do so just as the Roman emperors and
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.120]  senators did back in the Empire and also of course record numbers of Americans
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.880]  about a third of the whole population on some form of government welfare same
[14:18.880 --> 14:24.040]  situation in Rome so again we've also got the the moral decline of America you
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.600]  know added to the the obsession with sports and entertainment which is
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.600]  directly contributing to the decaying society because people are just obsessed
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.880]  with entertainment bread and circuses they abandoned their civic duties they're
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.320]  no longer interested same thing happened in Rome almost exactly the same thing
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.560]  that's because where the phrase bread and circuses came from there's actually a
[14:46.560 --> 14:53.920]  poem or a quote in this article written by the poet juvenile from 100 AD he was
[14:53.920 --> 14:58.400]  talking about Rome at the time and he wrote about how people had sacrificed
[14:58.400 --> 15:02.920]  their involvement in real affairs you know which directly impacted their lives
[15:02.920 --> 15:07.080]  and substituted them for bread and circuses exactly the same thing happening
[15:07.080 --> 15:13.760]  in America today just as in Rome we've got in America a situation where an
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.440]  overwhelming number of illegal immigrants have flooded in and refused to
[15:17.440 --> 15:20.540]  assimilate to the point where they're now trying to actually claim their own
[15:20.540 --> 15:26.480]  territory just as the tribes that flooded into Rome did all those centuries
[15:26.480 --> 15:31.080]  ago so again same parallel you know we got these Larassa movement we got the
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.520]  Mexican flag being flown above the American flag in places over on the
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.800]  west coast we got race being played off against race exactly what happened in
[15:39.800 --> 15:45.440]  Rome you can go through all the scholarly texts about how Rome collapsed and in
[15:45.440 --> 15:52.280]  almost every instance in society and the economy in culture America parallels
[15:52.280 --> 15:59.280]  Rome in every sense it's scary so you know where's it all leading it might take
[15:59.280 --> 16:02.840]  a couple of hundred years the Roman Empire lasted for what nearly a thousand
[16:02.840 --> 16:08.040]  years so we don't know the timeframe but what we do know is short-term all this
[16:08.040 --> 16:12.000]  is going to lead to riots and civil unrest and eventually it's going to lead
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.120]  to the collapse of America just as Rome collapsed 1600 years ago so basically
[16:18.120 --> 16:23.880]  this articles about the ruling class are they so consumed by their avarice and
[16:23.880 --> 16:29.680]  lust for power that their actions could lead to the actual collapse of Western
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.240]  civilization because it's happened before in history with the Roman Empire
[16:34.240 --> 16:40.200]  and other empires and there's no reason it can't happen again so Rome burned will
[16:40.200 --> 16:45.520]  we important article up infowalls.com that I put together with Alex Jones Paul
[16:45.520 --> 16:50.480]  Ryan sold shares on same day as private briefing of banking crisis this is at
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.520]  the Guardian Paul Ryan Mitt Romney's vice presidential running mate sold stock in
[16:55.520 --> 16:59.480]  US banks on the same day he attended a confidential meeting where top level
[16:59.480 --> 17:04.520]  officials disclosed the sector was heading for a deep crisis the congressman
[17:04.520 --> 17:07.960]  on Monday denied profiting from information gleaned from the meeting on
[17:07.960 --> 17:13.440]  18 September 2008 when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke then Treasury
[17:13.440 --> 17:17.320]  Secretary Hank Paulson and others outlined their fears for the banking
[17:17.320 --> 17:22.080]  sector his office said he had no control over the trades public records show that
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.600]  on the same day as the meeting Ryan sold stock in troubled banks including
[17:26.600 --> 17:31.280]  Wachovia and Citigroup and bought shares in Goldman Sachs Paulson's old
[17:31.280 --> 17:35.080]  employer and about that being disclosed to be stronger than many of its rivals
[17:35.080 --> 17:40.840]  the sale was not illegal at the time so you know what a surprise yet another
[17:40.840 --> 17:46.280]  compromised politician are now going to be Mitt Romney's running mate by the way
[17:46.280 --> 17:49.480]  that is something in the financial stack we're going to be getting to it's now
[17:49.480 --> 17:55.080]  well over 50 percent down Facebook stock as more of the insiders can quote
[17:55.080 --> 17:59.400]  legally dump their stock but I read where some of them dumped it right away
[17:59.400 --> 18:02.960]  but now they're saying they weren't allowed to dump it till now thought to
[18:02.960 --> 18:07.880]  research those conflicting reports but it's down well below 50% what a giant
[18:07.880 --> 18:14.560]  scam really run by a guy that calls his users that trust him dumb bleepers and a
[18:14.560 --> 18:19.120]  group that wants you to face scan to buy and sell and uses all the data on you
[18:19.120 --> 18:25.480]  and it's hooked in to the globalist that's why not this year not 2012 but 2011
[18:25.480 --> 18:29.880]  in St. Moritz Switzerland our reporters Paul Watson and Aaron Dice were there

[18:37.560 --> 18:41.800]  stock plunged to a new low Thursday after the expiration of a ban that had
[18:41.800 --> 18:47.240]  prevented some some see so some were allowed to investors and insiders from
[18:47.240 --> 18:51.440]  dumping millions of additional shares they own in the social networking leader
[18:51.440 --> 18:59.640]  firms raging from a sell partners to Goldman Sachs and others Peter Thiel

[19:03.880 --> 19:08.680]  stock they own after the lifting of a ban known as a lock-up period that was
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.760]  after the quote trouble the first few days as they were dumping if many of
[19:12.760 --> 19:16.440]  them took advantage of that Facebook stock could decline because the market
[19:16.440 --> 19:22.680]  would be flooded with nearly two-thirds more shares so it is making its race
[19:22.680 --> 19:28.200]  towards the toilet bowl right now and it's all a big joke to them it's all

[24:46.840 --> 25:02.000]  I could see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles I can see over the horizon

[25:08.400 --> 25:16.720]  situational awareness is all about but it's not hard to see for miles

[25:23.560 --> 25:33.360]  miles and miles and miles and miles and it's our goal to get you to where you
[25:33.360 --> 25:37.440]  could see for miles and miles and miles politically economically
[25:37.440 --> 25:45.840]  spiritually humans only live 75 years on average in the last 6000 years of
[25:45.840 --> 25:50.760]  recorded history there's only been 60 generations we're starting the 61st
[25:50.760 --> 26:00.200]  generation right now little more than 60 generations in recorded history humans
[26:00.200 --> 26:03.920]  always think they're smart especially criminals they think they got it all
[26:03.920 --> 26:10.240]  figured out they they have they have intelligence but not wisdom and they
[26:10.240 --> 26:16.800]  don't see what they create they don't see their own megalomania they're not humble
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.040]  they think they're winning if cancer had a consciousness as I've said a thousand
[26:21.040 --> 26:25.640]  times it would think it was winning it's not winning it's destroying as Max
[26:25.640 --> 26:31.360]  Kaiser said who's joining us tomorrow they're programmed to take it all and
[26:31.360 --> 26:36.400]  when I've seen countless stage shootings mass shootings murders terrorist attacks
[26:36.400 --> 26:39.840]  by every major government in the world the last hundred years over and over
[26:39.840 --> 26:43.880]  again from the czars to the Nazis to our government to the British government
[26:43.880 --> 26:48.360]  to Israel to the Arab governments this is one of the oldest tricks in the book
[26:48.360 --> 26:55.200]  and we have stage shootings of RFK and the list goes on and on of course we
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.440]  look at more modern events that have perfect timing with a bunch of anti-gun
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.480]  bills and UN treaties that have all the telltale signs of course we look at it
[27:04.480 --> 27:13.680]  and say number one suspect is who's done this before and only the naivete of the
[27:13.680 --> 27:21.040]  general public not knowing from historical experience and research only
[27:21.040 --> 27:26.160]  the night naivete allows this to happen you know Dave Mustaine's being attacked
[27:26.160 --> 27:31.520]  all over right now and he's happy with that or talking about the fact that he
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.480]  thinks Obama's people have a hand in staging the shootings they're the
[27:36.480 --> 27:45.560]  prime suspects now why is that well I mean if they've been caught shipping guns
[27:45.560 --> 27:49.760]  into Mexico to kill thousands as Larry Pratt has said they've got to be looked
[27:49.760 --> 27:53.600]  at for staging these when it has all the telltale signs and the timing and the
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.280]  fact that this is out there is going to backfire on the establishment they think
[27:57.280 --> 28:00.760]  they're going to demonize this idea everybody I know is going oh yeah that
[28:00.760 --> 28:05.440]  does make sense because we know you're a pack of criminal liars I didn't have to
[28:05.440 --> 28:11.000]  see for miles and miles and over the political horizon to know that Facebook
[28:11.000 --> 28:18.240]  was way overvalued probably ten times in its public offering its initial public
[28:18.240 --> 28:23.440]  offering to say it was a giant pump and dump scam with the whole media getting
[28:23.440 --> 28:28.880]  behind how great it was to sucker what they see as the idiot public I'm gonna
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.640]  tell you a brief story I'm gonna come back go to news I went yesterday I took
[28:33.640 --> 28:36.560]  my son to work I promised taken Barton Springs hadn't been there about a year

[34:55.200 --> 35:00.920]  have Richard Belzer on who wrote dead wrong straight facts on the country's
[35:00.920 --> 35:09.820]  most controversial cover-ups where they stayed shootings of RFK, JFK, the
[35:09.820 --> 35:12.680]  injection murder of Marilyn Monroe and the shooting killing of Martin Luther
[35:12.680 --> 35:18.320]  King we sell it at info warshop.com but the movie star and TV host I don't know
[35:18.320 --> 35:29.400]  a TV star will be joining us scheduled coming up in the third hour today. Dave
[35:29.400 --> 35:33.200]  Mustaine is locked and loaded to tape an interview with me today because he's in
[35:33.200 --> 35:36.640]  recording studio right now and he he's pretty professionally just does
[35:36.640 --> 35:43.280]  everything in the order he said he would I was set to go to a meeting after two
[35:43.280 --> 35:47.960]  but I can't really miss I don't know what we're gonna do with that just so
[35:47.960 --> 35:52.400]  happens I happen to have a recording though of Dave saying what's all in the
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.120]  news right now that I never aired I told people he said some controversial stuff
[35:57.120 --> 36:01.600]  and he wanted to air it and I said you know what I said they're gonna spend
[36:01.600 --> 36:05.200]  this against you and even though you'll come out good on the end I'm tired of
[36:05.200 --> 36:11.240]  my show being places where my friends get attacked I learned my lesson with
[36:11.240 --> 36:16.440]  Charlie Sheen again a huge attention for this show set of a million visitors
[36:16.440 --> 36:24.240]  today on info wars try five million for about a week but it's my friends and I
[36:24.240 --> 36:28.680]  don't want to see them have problems I mean I'm here to say it's an inside job
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.720]  all the evidence points towards it and I mean I'm kind of the kamikaze but
[36:33.720 --> 36:37.280]  Dave's done it you know Dave wanted to say it so he said it he said a more
[36:37.280 --> 36:43.360]  cogent link as he's on stage there and more focused on the show so I pretty
[36:43.360 --> 36:49.320]  much want to be given the green light to play it so he can clarify set it a few
[36:49.320 --> 36:53.920]  weeks ago but clarify it now what he said a few days ago with a tape but I'm
[36:53.920 --> 36:57.280]  I figure I just might as get him on instead so who knows maybe at the end of
[36:57.280 --> 37:00.600]  them bells are interviewed mustain may pop in or something he's got a break
[37:00.600 --> 37:07.600]  then but we're working on all that right now it is a big national news story it
[37:07.600 --> 37:14.440]  is in hundreds of publications right now and we have an info wars com article
[37:14.440 --> 37:19.040]  Dave mustain Obama staged Batman massacre like fast and furious down at
[37:19.040 --> 37:22.960]  the border well really what he's saying is he thinks they may have and that if
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.040]  you're already known for doing stuff like this you got to be a chief suspect
[37:27.040 --> 37:31.680]  when you have all the telltale signs of people saying multiple shooters we're
[37:31.680 --> 37:38.120]  going to be going over all of that and then with Gerald Salente they said
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.800]  they're the British said they're going to raid the Ecuadorian that totally
[37:43.800 --> 37:47.280]  violates international law in common sense that they're going to raid the
[37:47.280 --> 37:52.040]  embassy armed raid that's an attack on the sovereign country that's a war if
[37:52.040 --> 37:58.320]  they don't give up a son she's gotten asylum they were just blaming the
[37:58.320 --> 38:03.920]  Chinese a few weeks ago the Chinese are saying release our political dissident
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.440]  out of your embassy and then you know and of course Chinese did not dare go
[38:09.440 --> 38:15.160]  into the US embassy but now the Brits the globalists are so lawless they're
[38:15.160 --> 38:18.640]  saying they're going to go after them with an armed raid Briggs confront crime
[38:18.640 --> 38:24.200]  wave amid austerity BBC because they've taken most the guns there they have
[38:24.200 --> 38:27.720]  draconian gun control the public is just being fed on it says the police can't
[38:27.720 --> 38:31.200]  protect them oh really what do you think happens in New York and Chicago by the
[38:31.200 --> 38:37.880]  way they're reporting here that that areas out around the world that were
[38:37.880 --> 38:41.240]  the most dangerous in other countries are no longer the most dangerous in the
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.760]  world because Chicago is now the most dangerous in the world so because they
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.840]  have total gunbanned for the citizens there as well and we're going to get
[38:48.840 --> 38:53.000]  into Biden looks like he's out big stack of news on that front and what that
[38:53.000 --> 38:56.760]  signifies we'll cover that after this break but here is the video slash audio
[38:56.760 --> 39:02.080]  presentation full spectrum evil the video of your radio listener will be
[39:02.080 --> 39:05.760]  posted in the next 20 minutes at info wars.com get this out to everybody
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.960]  because if you understand what the bankers are funding al-qaeda you need to
[39:09.960 --> 39:14.040]  see this video and hear this audio here it is
[39:18.840 --> 39:23.960]  Alex Jones here to cover a topic an issue that is one of the most important
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.280]  I've ever discussed this information is very closely held by governments and
[39:29.280 --> 39:35.160]  elite corporations they do not want you understanding this now many of you that
[39:35.160 --> 39:39.960]  are already aware of this it'll seem simple but large swaths of the global
[39:39.960 --> 39:45.880]  population have no idea the real geopolitical paradigm that we're living
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.640]  in today today we'll look at the real forces the real players in the battle
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.680]  for 21st century global hegemony I'm gonna break down who really rules the
[39:55.680 --> 40:01.160]  world how they control the planet and how they are trying to usher in a world
[40:01.160 --> 40:06.560]  war that is really pointed at the general population to begin my
[40:06.560 --> 40:11.600]  illustration I have three different board games here chess the classic game of
[40:11.600 --> 40:17.000]  risk as well as monopoly we're gonna look at these systems of stylized
[40:17.000 --> 40:21.440]  warfare and between these three systems we find the truth of the system that
[40:21.440 --> 40:25.480]  we're living under how do we know that system well books written by people like
[40:25.480 --> 40:30.480]  Carol Quigley at Georgetown Bill Clinton's mentor they think we're
[40:30.480 --> 40:35.240]  stupid and so we have their own documents to begin with I'm going to use a
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.400]  Lego chess set as a illustration to break down primitive forms of government
[40:41.400 --> 40:46.720]  warfare and domination if you look at this set you notice there are two sides
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.840]  there is the red and there is the green or there is the black there is the white
[40:50.840 --> 40:56.000]  from the beginnings of civilization more than 6,000 years ago until about
[40:56.000 --> 41:03.320]  1700 this was the model of warfare between nations there were occasional
[41:03.320 --> 41:08.800]  alliances but by and large warfare and politics was carried out in a very two
[41:08.800 --> 41:14.600]  dimensional way like a chess set you have the ruling class the royalty the
[41:14.600 --> 41:20.880]  priest class the military elite the generals and in front of them you have
[41:20.880 --> 41:25.080]  basically their conscripts of the lower class fighters who can also represent
[41:25.080 --> 41:30.320]  just the general population and these two groups are engaged in warfare and
[41:30.320 --> 41:36.520]  base domination against each other to control larger areas of land and the
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.520]  vassal populations living and serfdom upon it one area that we see from the
[41:41.520 --> 41:47.000]  ancient chess model that is still used in statecraft by the globalist is the
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.920]  fact that sometimes wars were launched in the case of the French and the
[41:51.920 --> 41:57.240]  British against each other when they had rebellions at home they soon learned
[41:57.240 --> 42:03.920]  it was a way to turn inner anger at the state against a foreign state and to
[42:03.920 --> 42:09.120]  reduce the population of young males that you didn't have jobs for the two
[42:09.120 --> 42:16.440]  sided fight is a bygone era in truth for more than 300 years the globalist have
[42:16.440 --> 42:21.520]  been financing multiple sides of wars knowing that conflict destroys nations
[42:21.520 --> 42:27.640]  and gets countries deep into debt and that is the key they're financing both
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.840]  sides and we see this being pioneered by people like the Rothschild starting in
[42:32.840 --> 42:37.640]  the 17 and 1800s where they would finance sometimes three or four different
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.360]  factions and it didn't matter who won because all of them were in debt to them
[42:42.360 --> 42:48.440]  and had societies that were wrecked after the wars next let's look at the game of
[42:48.440 --> 42:55.760]  risk these are primitive attempts to distill down human conflict and
[42:55.760 --> 43:01.640]  domination into a game you can play in a few hours the militaries all have
[43:01.640 --> 43:06.240]  basically equal resources equal numbers of troops and to enter into the equation
[43:06.240 --> 43:12.240]  some type of random probability we have dice and we have carts there is no
[43:12.240 --> 43:18.160]  discussion here on looking at the real model that we are under today we're
[43:18.160 --> 43:23.600]  going to come back to risk here in a moment but first let's move to the game
[43:23.600 --> 43:29.600]  of monopoly in the game of monopoly you have different economic groups or four
[43:29.600 --> 43:34.680]  players that attempt to engage in economic warfare against each other and
[43:34.680 --> 43:41.400]  then be able to create a monopoly or a single entity that is in control of New
[43:41.400 --> 43:45.920]  York City to understand the real system we're under it's important to combine
[43:45.920 --> 43:52.080]  monopoly and risk with an overlay of strategy from chess and this is a key
[43:52.080 --> 43:56.280]  part of the real system we live under today the founder of the Rockefeller
[43:56.280 --> 44:01.280]  dynasty famously said that competition was a sin and they wanted big
[44:01.280 --> 44:05.840]  governments that they financed and control to be able to shut down their
[44:05.840 --> 44:10.720]  competition and pick winners and losers this is the essence of monopoly
[44:10.720 --> 44:15.560]  capitalism the opposite of free market and it's simply a form of fascism what
[44:15.560 --> 44:21.600]  Mussolini called corporatism so out of these three board games monopoly best
[44:21.600 --> 44:26.680]  describes our modern system but in itself is only two-dimensional you see the
[44:26.680 --> 44:31.520]  private Federal Reserve that's owned by six private banks Goldman Sachs JP Morgan
[44:31.520 --> 44:37.800]  Bank of America and others they always win you're playing their game you think
[44:37.800 --> 44:42.960]  you're battling it out for houses and apartments and for park place and for
[44:42.960 --> 44:46.920]  the electric company and for the railroad and for the top hat and for the
[44:46.920 --> 44:51.520]  fashion show but it's the bankers that control the politicians they've got to
[44:51.520 --> 44:57.040]  get out of jail free card and they've got control of the money the Treasury
[44:57.040 --> 45:04.360]  works for them so the bank always wins but what happens if a country won't sell
[45:04.360 --> 45:10.960]  what happens if an African nation won't play the monopoly game or what happens
[45:10.960 --> 45:16.000]  of a Middle Eastern country doesn't want to be part of the modern Bankster
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.520]  system based in London and New York well then that's where risk comes in
[45:20.520 --> 45:25.320]  because they want to be able to take you over through economic espionage as John
[45:25.320 --> 45:29.880]  Perkins has written and his bestseller confessions of an economic hitman but if
[45:29.880 --> 45:35.360]  they can't this is in all the official CIA and State Department documents they
[45:35.360 --> 45:42.240]  will then come and finance your neighbor to attack you so Libby is not playing
[45:42.240 --> 45:47.400]  ball it's building up an industrializing all of Africa you want a global
[45:47.400 --> 45:51.600]  monopoly you just play countries off against each other you're a globalist
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.960]  you've made yourselves example diplomatic community at the United Nations who set
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.800]  that up the robber barons what do you do you just have al-Qaeda come out of
[46:00.800 --> 46:06.480]  Egypt in delivia ethnically cleanse blow up most of the infrastructure knockout
[46:06.480 --> 46:13.840]  Gaddafi and now they have to come to you and borrow money out of your bank to
[46:13.840 --> 46:18.440]  rebuild and you own and control everything and guess what if you want to
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.240]  get that welfare check well you got to take the vaccines which by the way
[46:22.240 --> 46:26.840]  sterilize you so they're using the strategy of chess but they're employing
[46:26.840 --> 46:31.760]  it through a monopolistic system where they have a monopoly on the issuance of
[46:31.760 --> 46:36.360]  currency and credit and they also have the biggest militaries on earth from the
[46:36.360 --> 46:41.520]  United States and Europe controlled and dominated a hundred percent by them
[46:41.520 --> 46:45.760]  they've announced that we're totally their slaves and they have such disdain
[46:45.760 --> 46:51.920]  for us they use our supposed enemy al-Qaeda against the Russians against the
[46:51.920 --> 46:57.120]  Serbs and now against other Middle Eastern nations while simultaneously
[46:57.120 --> 47:03.080]  telling us we need military style occupation within our countries by the
[47:03.080 --> 47:10.360]  TSA in the military to keep us safe from al-Qaeda who they sponsored and created
[47:10.360 --> 47:16.080]  and remember the banksters are openly crowing and bragging that they have
[47:16.080 --> 47:21.600]  conquered you through monopoly capitalism the question is do we all work
[47:21.600 --> 47:25.960]  for central bankers that's what I want to address to our guests tonight is this
[47:25.960 --> 47:30.040]  global governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.960]  aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do answer your
[47:33.960 --> 47:38.120]  question we are absolutely slaves to central banks and they weren't able to
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.200]  do this because they had better products they were able to do it because they
[47:42.200 --> 47:47.040]  created their fractional reserve banking here in the US and similar systems
[47:47.040 --> 47:52.720]  worldwide unlimited free credit for themselves which they then loan out to
[47:52.720 --> 47:58.440]  you at interest but that wasn't enough of a fraud for them in the last 20 years
[47:58.440 --> 48:04.000]  they've deployed derivatives completely made up counterfeit instruments to the
[48:04.000 --> 48:13.240]  tune of more than 1.5 quadrillion that's 1500 trillion with that counterfeit
[48:13.240 --> 48:17.640]  money they were able to buy up all of their competition pay off the
[48:17.640 --> 48:22.440]  governments and dominate defense industries as well as media to carry
[48:22.440 --> 48:27.240]  out their propaganda and herein lies the big secret that they don't want you to
[48:27.240 --> 48:34.320]  know the big secret hiding in plain view we think about nations and continents
[48:34.320 --> 48:40.560]  and cultures but in truth the globalist the bankers who have unlimited money
[48:40.560 --> 48:46.360]  they're waging war against anyone else that has any assets because they want
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.520]  everyone to be impoverished so you have to go to them and so that you have to
[48:51.520 --> 48:56.840]  follow all of their orders so they can control human development and society
[48:56.840 --> 49:01.360]  in the past they would brag about their real political system in fictional
[49:01.360 --> 49:05.760]  accounts in movies like network let's analyze a clip of that there is no
[49:05.760 --> 49:15.920]  America there is no democracy there is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and Dupont
[49:15.920 --> 49:27.120]  Dow Union Carbide and Exxon one vast and ecumenical holding for whom all men will
[49:27.120 --> 49:33.400]  work to serve a common profit in which all men will hold a share of stock oh
[49:33.400 --> 49:38.560]  there are no more peoples there are no more nations mr. Beale each one of us
[49:38.560 --> 49:44.560]  has one piece of stock in the global system one ecumenical giant global
[49:44.560 --> 49:48.520]  government except one thing that big global corporate system they've been
[49:48.520 --> 49:53.920]  selling us on doesn't want us to even be alive it's designed to consolidate
[49:53.920 --> 49:58.400]  control and then slowly cut off the resources while the banksters themselves
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.360]  poses the saviors selling people on getting deeper into the tyranny and the
[50:03.360 --> 50:07.000]  pain will stop when at the end of the tunnel is nothing but global
[50:07.000 --> 50:12.520]  extermination and eugenics so that these selfish greedy scam artists can
[50:12.520 --> 50:16.760]  have the world and all of the incredible technology and life extension for
[50:16.760 --> 50:22.140]  themselves and that's the big secret here you have been warned I'm Alex

[54:00.520 --> 54:06.360]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[54:06.360 --> 54:11.240]  because there's a war on for your mind
[54:14.800 --> 54:18.960]  police chief Dan Oates issues this immediate public statement claiming
[54:18.960 --> 54:23.200]  there is just one shooter every single indicator is that this was this is all
[54:23.200 --> 54:28.200]  Mr. Holmes's activity and that he wasn't particularly aided by anyone else this
[54:28.200 --> 54:32.920]  is the same police chief that presided over a blatant violation of the Fourth
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.960]  Amendment by illegally cuffing and detaining 40 innocent people including
[54:36.960 --> 54:42.680]  women and children for over two hours while looking for a bank robber early on
[54:42.680 --> 54:45.880]  the police scanner supports the one-shooter theory
[54:45.880 --> 54:49.680]  I need a march core behind the theater
[54:49.680 --> 54:53.240]  saberside suspect in a gas mask
[54:53.240 --> 54:57.240]  sure and I know pain we need cars south side suspect in a gas mask
[54:57.240 --> 55:00.120]  mainstream media promotes the one-shooter theory
[55:00.120 --> 55:04.000]  and honestly for the record there was only one guy yes actually the shooting
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.680]  probably started like lasted probably for like about a minute or two but
[55:07.680 --> 55:12.400]  according to the police scanner another suspect is spotted just three minutes
[55:12.400 --> 55:17.280]  later 321 one of the shooters might be wearing a white and blue plaid shirt
[55:17.280 --> 55:21.000]  copy outstanding shooter possibly wearing a white and blue plaid shirt
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.120]  he had a foot prop open by the door and from the crack it looked like he was
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.760]  signaling somebody or looking for somebody to come in his way from what we
[55:28.760 --> 55:33.520]  saw he wasn't alone he had someone with him because the the second can of tear
[55:33.520 --> 55:38.760]  gas didn't come from his side he was completely dressed in in black head to
[55:38.760 --> 55:43.520]  toe from what we saw he'd seem like he had something over his face probably to
[55:43.520 --> 55:47.400]  prevent him from breathing it in and I we can only assume that someone got him
[55:47.400 --> 55:51.840]  in because he was hit whatever he was wearing seemed thick so I don't think
[55:51.840 --> 55:55.600]  he would really I think he'd stand out in the crowd one shooter theory loses
[55:55.600 --> 56:01.080]  even more credibility when a second gas mask is discovered how is it possible
[56:01.080 --> 56:07.080]  that 12 people were killed in 58 were injured by a semi-automatic weapon that
[56:07.080 --> 56:12.760]  jammed he shot easily like six years 70 rounds then there is the official story
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.520]  given by the president himself concerning the blood path behind the
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.880]  theater Obama claims that this wound spilled what appears to be buckets of
[56:21.880 --> 56:27.720]  blood in the aftermath the vulture media swoops in misquoting Holmes mother
[56:27.720 --> 56:31.680]  regarding the shooting causing her to issue this statement I did not know
[56:31.680 --> 56:38.240]  anything about a shooting in Aurora at that time he asked if I was Arlene Holmes
[56:38.240 --> 56:49.080]  and if my son was James Holmes who lives in Aurora Colorado I answered yes you
[56:49.080 --> 56:55.800]  have the right person home's father worked for San Diego based HNC
[56:55.800 --> 57:00.560]  software incorporated a company that worked with DARPA to develop
[57:00.560 --> 57:05.920]  Cortronic neural networks these enable machines to translate oral and visual
[57:05.920 --> 57:11.400]  stimuli and simulate human thinking and Holmes grandfather had deep ties into
[57:11.400 --> 57:15.840]  the intelligence framework of the US military the children of people with
[57:15.840 --> 57:20.080]  similar backgrounds are highly susceptible to exposure to monarch
[57:20.080 --> 57:26.920]  mind control using brainwashed patsies in psyop massacres has become a common
[57:26.920 --> 57:31.400]  place thread in American history as the shadow government strengthens its
[57:31.400 --> 57:35.800]  stranglehold on public perception instead of really digging into why this
[57:35.800 --> 57:39.160]  apartment would be rigged to kill but then Holmes would then warn police and
[57:39.160 --> 57:43.160]  then lawyer up and not say anything else where he got the funding and the
[57:43.160 --> 57:46.600]  firearms training and these eyewitness reports that there was more than one
[57:46.600 --> 57:51.080]  person yeah instead of asking those questions national media want to focus
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.760]  all their attention on why guns were legal in the first place now is the
[57:55.760 --> 57:59.600]  time to shine a light on the obvious motive behind this tragic event the

[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:08.800]  my friends do you know one of the key hallmarks of a hardcore police state
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.880]  whether it was Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany governments would take
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.120]  political dissidents passports away in the United States that's only done if
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:23.440]  you've been charged with espionage or if you're out on bail for a serious crime
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:29.320]  the IRS has written a law that's passed the Senate is now in the house and
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:33.080]  Forbes and other publications are reporting on it like it's no big deal
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:39.440]  hey if the IRS says you owe back taxes you're not going to be allowed to travel
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.720]  outside the country they're going to take your passport how many times have I
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:47.920]  told you this was coming this is exactly what the IMF and World Bank the
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.560]  consortium for the international arm of the private fellow reserve have called
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.640]  for for more than 15 years a global cashless society already many jobs you
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:01.840]  got to get TSA approval and authorization to have them I saw Homeland Security
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.160]  nine years ago on C-SPAN say you're not going to go on a plane if you haven't
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.440]  paid your taxes you're not going to get a driver's license you're not gonna be
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:16.800]  allowed to work this is total enslavement this is beyond anything we've seen in
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:24.120]  history it is incredibly illegal travel is a right not a privilege a passport is
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:30.120]  a right as a citizen this represents with drawing and revoking your
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.400]  citizenship that's what it is under another name they tried to pass a bill
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:38.760]  last year for any reason the president wishes outside of a court to take your
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.640]  citizenship away and then they say they can secretly arrest you or kill you when
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.360]  he couldn't get that pass he just signed the NDAA and said he can secretly arrest
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.440]  you or kill you well a law that's unconstitutional is null and void Marbury
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:56.160]  versus Madison what this represents is capital controls when governments start
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.480]  to collapse throughout history they always try to clamp down on people leaving
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:06.640]  the country with money bottom line the IRS is the collection agency for the
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:13.560]  private Federal Reserve pre-1913 dollars that were fiat were backed partially
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:20.840]  by silver and gold and said United States note on them after 1913 they said
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:27.800]  Federal Reserve note and 63 Kennedy reissued five dollar bills that said
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.200]  United States note on them and he signed an executive order to begin the
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.280]  abolishment of the private Federal Reserve and its collection agency of the
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:45.000]  IRS that's why the banksters killed him my point is yes a country has to have
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.760]  taxes but these aren't taxes these are levies to private international banks
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.520]  just as Europe admits they're now under Goldman Sachs dictatorship not through
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.920]  money they owe Goldman Sachs got their governments to sign on to the derivative
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:06.080]  fraud they created this is so incredible and now the banksters are saying if you
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.280]  don't pay all the taxes we want directly into our private coffers of the
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.520]  Federal Reserve outside of a court outside of a conviction outside of law
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.720]  we're gonna put you on a no-fly list just like Rahm Emanuel former chief of
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.600]  staff at the White House Saturday gun grabber meeting he said look if you're
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.120]  on a no-fly list over two million Americans are on that by the way you're
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:31.000]  not able to buy a gun that is if you are on the no-fly list because you are
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:38.400]  known as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in America one of
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.840]  the things you don't know about is the number of people that we have turned away
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:47.480]  because their name has been on the watch list or on the no-fly list only my mom
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.880]  could but not me my dad because both me and my dad are on the watch list now
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.600]  they say they want to expand that to wherever you haven't paid your taxes you
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.640]  can't buy a gun of course these are taxes to the IRS and they just say you
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.560]  haven't paid the bankers are taking control of our lives they are squeezing
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.960]  Europeans with the exact same system this is hardcore fascism this is
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.520]  incredible tyranny and we've got to defeat this legislation that is now in
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.840]  the house get these articles and get them out to everybody and demand that
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.280]  the corporate whore dinosaur media cover this because these are internal
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.640]  checkpoints internal passports and they're saying they're gonna revoke your
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:34.120]  citizenship that's what this does extra judicially this is off the Richter scale
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:40.120]  when it comes to despotic oppressive tyranny the Federal Reserve is engaged
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:44.440]  in a total coup d'etat over due process and threatening to revoke our
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:50.480]  citizenship and pull our passports if we don't fully submit to the bankers the
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.280]  bankers are pressuring local governments to raise the local property tax
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.840]  that we didn't have till 60 years ago in this country that turns your property

[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.160]  about the fact that he thinks the president's a criminal liar a few weeks
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.240]  ago on the show I just interviewed Dave Mustaine that's why we aired a few of
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.960]  our special reports the last 15 minutes I just went over to the TV side and did

[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:32.400]  researcher Richard Belzer who has written dead wrong straight facts on the
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.560]  country's most controversial cover-ups about government shooting people and
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.640]  staging it and blaming patsy's isn't that funny we had this guest set up two
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.760]  weeks ago Jesse Ventura wrote the forward here's the deal operation
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.880]  northwoods calls for shooting people in movie theaters and on the streets and
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.120]  blaming political enemies operation gladio hundreds of bombings and shootings
[01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:57.240]  in Europe carried out by NATO partially declassified the Italian government
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.560]  completely declassified it blowing up school buses shooting people bombing
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.720]  theater shooting up theaters shooting up churches shooting up police stations to
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.480]  blame their political enemies whether they be left or right wing if the
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.640]  groups weren't controlled by the globalist didn't want the bankers to take
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:16.280]  over like they've done now you get a bombing or a shooting they mustain has
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:21.080]  come out and said hey if they stage fast and furious they stage this we got a
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:27.040]  look at it said at a concert overseas and we've been talking on the phone
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.840]  lately about this you know the Sikhs president saying he saw multiple you know
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:35.920]  people casing it witnesses all saying four shooters that's what was reported
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.360]  we need to look at this we'd be idiots if we didn't it's time to stop trusting
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.520]  the system now I'll tell you this is breaking just like with the Dixie
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.160]  chicks saying they didn't agree with the war they're trying to cancel his tours
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.400]  they're trying to persecute Dave mustain right now like Chick-fil-a even if you
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.080]  don't agree with what Chick-fil-a did you've got to support the first
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.920]  amendment with these bullies I went in and shot up the family research group
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:08.040]  the family research council yesterday with bunch of Chick-fil-a stuff saying he
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.760]  was mad at him okay these are terrorists you've got to support the first
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.880]  amendment and we will have that exclusive Dave mustain statement coming up
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.880]  I frankly he said stuff after the Batman shooting an interview we taped after the
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.760]  show one day and I'm even Eric because I didn't want this big controversy even
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:29.000]  though I knew in the end he'd come out smelling like a rose I just I just don't
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.880]  like my friends having this stuff happen to him on my show that's happened a lot
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:36.720]  of times but they're gonna come after him folks they're gonna come after them
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.440]  they didn't go after Larry Pratt because he's a Fox News contributor that doesn't
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.160]  fit into their whole game plan they think he's a good target and now we're
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.440]  gonna talk about the economy the accelerating world events with the
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:52.600]  premier trends forecaster joining us via video Skype right now he is Gerald
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:57.760]  Salente with a balance of the hour and there's so much I want to get into I
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:02.040]  mean there is so much that I want to break down they look they're about to
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.440]  dump Biden right now that's the writing on the wall we'll get his take on that
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:12.560]  we have got just amazing stuff federal courts ruling that cell phone tracking
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.520]  is legal just throwing out the fourth amendment that they're saying they're
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:22.840]  gonna raid the Uruguayan they're saying the Ecuadorian excuse me the
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:28.080]  Ecuador teleprompter free folks the the embassy which is just incredibly
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:35.120]  illegal because they're gonna try to give him political asylum just amazing
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:39.560]  the type of evil we're seeing Ecuador grants asylum to WikiLeaks Assange all of
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:43.320]  that and all the big articles in fact I left at the studio from last now you
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:46.720]  guys bring me all the financial crash stuff you've been called a pessimist
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:53.160]  porn dealer Gerald Salente of the Trends Journal for predicting with precision
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:57.200]  everything that's happening the wars the Tea Party years before it came the
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.400]  attacks on small businesses the rebellion the meltdown of derivatives that
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.080]  we were really in a depression and never left the recession all of that
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.680]  confirmed are saying get the banks ready for collapse you know the elites are
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.720]  all buying gold up that was in the news sorrows the rest of them literally
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:18.880]  everything you've said but you don't get you don't get praised by the corporate
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:22.520]  prostitutes you invented that word for telling the truth you get even more
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:28.960]  demonized as it all unfolds so so you've told us what was coming tell us and it's
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:35.040]  come true tell us what's coming now Gerald Salente what's coming now
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:41.320]  unfortunately looks like our worst scenario forecast that we've made
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:47.440]  recently and that's the first great war of the 21st century and people refuse to
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:53.280]  put the pieces together whether it's what going on in Syria is very clear this
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:59.400]  is a move to limit the power of Iran and Hezbollah you know people think that
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:05.480]  Israel lost against Lebanon in that last war and one of the reasons why was
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:10.480]  they were getting armaments from Iran and Syria the other issue of course is
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.920]  when you move beyond that there's a revolution going on in Yemen and they're
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:19.560]  very concerned because Yemen backs up to Saudi Arabia which as everyone knows
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.480]  is the greatest oil producer on the planet and the people there are very
[01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:30.060]  unhappy and I know that this may sound contrary to all those fairy tales that
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:35.160]  were all taught as little boys and girls they don't like the king the king
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.480]  how about calling him a dictator oh no he's a king hey ladies you want a free
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:47.160]  Afghanistan right here all that all of the time you can't drive a car in in
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.360]  the kingdom so you have a revolution going on there that's spilling over
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:57.240]  Bahrain is ready to go up in flames Greece is cooked you have an unemployment
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:05.840]  rate of over 25% but just officially and then youth unemployment over 50% you
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:11.480]  see what's going on in Spain they don't report the millions of indignados that
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.960]  are taking to the streets to it's it's turned back you know how I talk about
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:24.200]  Alex that the timelines are parallels to the crash of 29 the Great Depression
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.720]  the currency wars trade wars world war the panic of 08 the Great Depression
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:35.960]  slash Great Recession currency wars are going on the trade wars and world wars
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:44.520]  Spain so just play back into that it's a replay almost of the 1930s just the
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:51.640]  names and the situations have changed the people are in Franco era depression
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:59.320]  levels oh and then over there in France yeah they just got a new president over
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.600]  there and you read the language in the toilet paper of record the New York
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:09.240]  Times the self-proclaimed paper of record they have a little story in there
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:18.440]  about the riots going on in France and you know who's writing hey those people
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:22.440]  from when they used to remember those French used to take over Algeria
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:27.720]  Morocco and then all those people came over to France yeah them and you know
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:36.000]  them is them are the 50% of the youth unemployment demographic it's
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.120]  unemployment worldwide you know my saying when people lose everything and
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.400]  have nothing left to lose they lose it they're losing it around the world the
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:51.680]  war has begun you I read your website and I see what you are posting on there
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.720]  about the hollow point bullets we all know about the National Defense
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.960]  Authorization Act about all the armaments going into our military police
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:05.880]  because now they've both become one with the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:12.200]  and the repeal of the 1878 Kameh Posatata's Act Passe Comatata's Act that
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:18.720]  allows the military to take over police duties so yes the whole thing is
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:25.320]  collapsing and now of course we gotta run gotta go after Iran and what are the
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:29.560]  reports out they're re there I'm not making this up this is coming out of
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.160]  Israel they're preparing the people for a 30-day war what's psychopath came up
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:41.320]  with this idea 30 days oh you could put a timeline on it at they're nuts they're
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.400]  out of this they're out of their minds and they're taking the people to war the
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:51.560]  meantime let's go look at some economic data oh China you know China's export
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:58.800]  numbers were last month how about 1% growth virtually nothing their their
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:06.440]  imports were only 4% you look at Brazil they just announced the 66 billion
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:13.040]  dollar stimulus program the reality is crashing the Indian rupee is in the
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.080]  toilet and they're trying to stop people from buying gold oh when you mentioned
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:24.400]  that Soros and Paulson are blowing up tons of gold oh but they're brilliant
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:30.680]  when Salendi says it oh he's a gloom and tumor oh you can't eat gold oh you can't
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.040]  eat gold how about shoving this oh no I have to be clean this is a this is a
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.160]  chill this Gerald speaking of that let me throw this at you as you know the
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.720]  Associated Press reporting is under your newshound you'll know this reported
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:47.320]  yesterday that Chinese government has suspended all purchases of US stocks
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.400]  saying the system can't be trusted and just last week they had articles
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:56.200]  admitting that the flash trading is such a manipulation stealing billions a day
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.380]  that you can't even trust the market it's totally rigged
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:07.400]  only an imbecile only and not only an imbecile only the people that would vote
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:16.480]  for Romney and Ryan or Biden and Obama are too stupid enough too blind and
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:23.920]  too ideological to admit the entire system is rigged the last time we're
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:29.960]  talking about the LIBOR scandal oh what's a LIBOR oh yeah what's a LIBOR it
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:36.320]  only controls all the money that's being created and interest rates oh that's all
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:43.120]  it is and it was rigged and as you pointed out the the high the high
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:50.160]  frequency trading yeah the game is rigged E trade how about F trade here's

[01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.840]  thinking what if my family had been home the police officers said that more
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:24.400]  than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop

[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:21.000]  what do you expect to happen now that they're scurrying around themselves
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.080]  talking about a very serious collapse and what do they mean by a banking
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:30.240]  collapse what would that look like Gerald Salente well what it's going to
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.480]  look like is you're gonna they're going to call a bank holiday if this thing
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:40.200]  continues to collapse and we had wrote about that we even had a link up of Joe
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:48.200]  Biden campaigning for John the Slime Corzine that's right the former governor
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:55.240]  of New Jersey and senator of New Jersey also in form ahead of the Goldman
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:01.640]  Sachs gang back in 2009 Biden is saying it's there on YouTube anybody could find
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.120]  it that when the Obama administration got into office the first thing the
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:11.240]  transition team was talking about was calling a bank holiday and Biden repeats
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.920]  it that's right a holiday it ain't no holiday you can't get your money oh and
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.840]  by the way before I go on speaking of John Corzine did you see the headline
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:26.360]  today in the New York Times you know the self-proclaimed paper of record more
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:32.720]  aptly called the toilet paper of record no criminal case is likely in loss at
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:39.400]  Corzine firm I want to read to you this little bit to show you toilet paper talk
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:44.120]  a criminal investigation into the collapse of the brokerage firm MF
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.600]  global and the disappearance of about one billion dollars in customer money
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:56.320]  disappearance what did it just evaporate oh no but I'll go on disappearance
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:02.960]  that's toilet paper talk so that you think it's legit about what is now
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.640]  heading into its final stage without charges expected against any top
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:14.040]  executives that's right they'll get some low-level sap astooge to take out but
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:19.720]  here's where it gets good after 10 months of stitching together evidence on the
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.400]  firm's demise stitching together evidence again more toilet paper talk on
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:32.760]  the on the firm's demise criminal investigators are concluding that chaos
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:40.080]  and porous risk control porous risk controls at the firm rather than fraud
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:47.000]  allowed the money to disappear according to people involved in the case
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:53.640]  disappear it just disappeared 1.6 billion dollars disappeared and this
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:58.040]  sets an incredible I mean this sets an incredible new precedent I'm seeing top
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:02.400]  money managers getting out of the market entirely citing this and citing
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.200]  federal cases now saying no one's money is safe in banks anywhere as you said
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:12.420]  last November when the heist first began that's exactly it now I want you one
[01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.120]  more thing I want to read out of this they're talking about the bet he made a
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:20.680]  one point a six point three billion dollar wages report the thing down MF
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:25.920]  global on European sovereign debt proof fatal and again how can any imbecile this
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.640]  guy supposed to be so smart bet on European sovereign debt as your the
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:36.000]  euro crisis is going into the toilet the size of the bet was enough to wipe out
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.920]  the firm many times over and as questions about Europe's health grew a run
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:51.600]  on MF global ensued in the panic the firm tapped customer money to stay afloat
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:59.720]  it didn't tap customer money it stole customer money out of our segregated
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:06.800]  accounts but the toilet paper and the rest of the prostitutes the CNN the
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:16.400]  Cartoon News Network the ABC clowns the MSNBC shills they refuse to go after the
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:22.920]  big guys because they're prostitutes and they bow down are they not in now
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.600]  actually aiding and abetting in the criminality when they call stealing

[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:09.360]  we'll leave it at that Gerald Salente but it wasn't stolen it was tapped the
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:13.640]  first they say in the same article it disappeared but then it was tapped you
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:17.440]  know it disappeared like into JP Morgan's pocket as he and Max Kaiser said
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:22.600]  now back in October November and now it's confirmed JP Morgan London got it
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:29.760]  HSBC is in mainstream news running drugs just like Wacovia Wells Fargo in the
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:34.280]  hundreds of billions a year those guys running the torture aircraft running the
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:40.480]  drug aircraft stealing people's pension funds selling into the market stuff that
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.600]  they know is worthless crud bragging about it those emails are out there but
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.640]  they're just tapping it when they lie to an old lady and sell her fraud with
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.080]  Timberwolf and now we said this months before you said it we said it I mean
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.680]  it's not like we're even that smart we're just not total idiot chump suckers
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.200]  who love being taken for a ride every day you know I mean you know you rape me
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:03.840]  10 or 15 times I'm not gonna trust you anymore that's why we're extremist
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:08.880]  pessimist porn bad people we talked about Zuckerberg and Facebook and the
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:12.480]  fact that even mainline groups were saying it was it overvalued by ten
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.240]  times at least some estimates were 20 times but it was 1015 you know they're
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.840]  in that area it varied and and of course they were allowed to dump up front and
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.280]  then dump later and they're dumping it it's totally illegal but they sent Martha
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  Stewart and they're trying to get the owner of the Mavericks who criticized
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:33.280]  Bush who didn't engage in insider trading clearly they're going after them
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:38.360]  cuz oh look we get the bad men there's the bad men there's the bad woman but
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:42.560]  not the real crooks that make Bernie Madoff and Ken lay look honest what do
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:46.680]  you say about Facebook here Gerald Salente and the fact that now the
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:51.600]  criminality is just parading around and the prostitutes as you said are saying
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.600]  the sky's the limit I mean I guess that's why judges think they can say no
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.160]  fourth amendment now because the media will cover their their evil war covered
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.120]  patutes I mean I mean what is the end once corruption in history as you know
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:10.400]  reaches this festering point when the pustule pops and and and just day looses
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:15.760]  us in the scruffy of a stink where are we going here I'm ranting I'm sorry well
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:19.040]  on the Facebook issue you know we have trends in the news as part of the
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:23.320]  subscription for the trends journal and when the IPO came out I said I'm not
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:26.680]  telling people how to invest I don't give an investment advice I'm a
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:32.120]  forecaster and I'm forecasting this thing is gonna dump out and I would not
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.240]  put my money in it and the reason is because it's all you got to get
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.040]  advertising and people use Facebook for what it is who looks at the advertising
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:46.720]  people blast right by it the other issue of course be it's a fad it's not a
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:53.960]  trend I wrote in trend tracking in 1996 what they're calling social networking I
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:59.680]  call the techno tribalism it has much more richness than just bs-ing back and
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.280]  forth to people so he knew it was a bust where is it all going and as we look
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.920]  at we talked about LIBOR we're talking about all the criminality going on in
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:14.040]  all the different levels you mentioned HSBC you could go down the list one
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:19.760]  fine after another no one's head rolls and it just keeps going the fish rots
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:25.560]  from the head down the entire system in the United States as you look at it is
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:31.680]  nothing more than a fish rotting within morality how about that lovely war over
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:38.160]  there in Afghanistan hey all you Obama nieces remember when he had that troops
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:45.160]  served

[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.680]  the latest episode of the presidential reality show it was the perfect metaphor
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:29.960]  for America Romney and Ryan standing in front of a
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:35.600]  mothball battleship mothballs maybe that's what these guys are carrying
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:41.240]  around with them because it was the perfect metaphor two little chicken
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:45.920]  hawks talking tough with a decommissioned ship that was out of state they
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:52.280]  stopped battleships before the end of World War two and they're the tough
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.440]  talking guys right no one's talking about cutting the military so as we're
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:02.040]  looking at the fish rotting from the head down we talked about the military
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:08.080]  we talked about the economy now I'm a guy still living in the Bronx and of a
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:13.280]  different head and I'd say to my buddy Joey listen we're gonna go do a deal
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:17.600]  now here's what we're gonna do and Joey says with the other guys and we all
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:21.640]  said Joey charged up hey Gerald come on that's not honest man we're gonna rip
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:26.600]  somebody off like that I say what are you stupid what's the matter with you
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:32.560]  look at this stealing at the top they're robbing us every day they stuck
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:38.240]  your mother's house she's out on the street your father ain't got a job your
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.520]  brother died in Iraq you know what are you stupid they're ripping us off at
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:50.160]  every level and you're gonna play it straight all the society is rotting out
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:55.960]  because it's rotting from the head of Obama it's rotting from the head of
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:02.760]  Bush and Chady it's rotten like Romney and Ryan and you know how I say Alex I
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.760]  been saying it for years since you've known me that these guys that everybody's
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:13.400]  sucking up and bowing down to are nothing more than the class presidents and
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:17.960]  head of the student council and now they followed their career path it could
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:25.280]  not be clearer than with Paul little high school altar boy Ryan it's great the
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:30.120]  altar boy in a guy that wears the magic underwear the Mormon it's perfect it's
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:36.480]  right out of the presidential reality show Paul Ryan voted by his classmates
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:42.560]  who are smarter than everybody else out there is high school kids as the brown
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:49.440]  nose are over here I'm not making it up it's there the class president a guy
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:55.080]  that never worked a day in his life born on third base like Romney and thinks he
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:01.760]  hits a triple and people clap like little children all aboard next train to
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.920]  Auschwitz that's where this country is going
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.280]  continue my brother you are laying it out and I mean where do you see it ending
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:14.640]  where do you see it going if we don't turn this around to clear marshal on the
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:18.960]  people they're gonna go after guys like you and me they're gonna go after
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:24.040]  everybody that speaks out and calls them out on their crap what adult can
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:29.320]  believe this stupid cheap show did you see Obama when the hell does this guy
[01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:34.280]  work he's been out on a campaign trail every day every four years this is where
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:39.040]  you could find these guys they'll be at Pete's barbecue sitting on a bill a
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:44.480]  there's Obama in front of a whole bunch of rotted corn every four years Freddy's
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:52.480]  clam house sitting there in at Maggie's diner and the people by this crap
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.320]  wait wait wait for the first time even businesses that don't like them for the
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.720]  business are telling them you're not welcome here and they're getting ready
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:04.560]  to dump Biden hoping that wakes people back up clearly they've got all the
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:08.040]  signs on that front so I do see an awakening happening but you're right
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.720]  the level of tyranny we will live under as Thomas Jefferson said is the exact
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.600]  amount we'll put up with so now that they're so cornered like rats you've
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:21.920]  said they implode the economy then they start a war to distract everybody but
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:25.480]  do you think that's gonna work I mean even most the Israelis don't want to
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:31.480]  war it will work you should you know we sent out a trend alert we wrote about
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:38.960]  Ryan in last year and let you got it last summer's trends journal that whole
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:43.560]  one about direct democracy and we had a thing we even had we even had Ryan's
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:48.640]  weenie mobile and we showed what a little nobody this guy is and why would
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:53.560]  anybody listen to this jerk who never did a damn thing in his life and I love
[01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:58.120]  the term they give lawmakers I don't need a lawmaker who made it would you go
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:03.560]  to school for lawmaking anyway something that's where that comes from the
[01:44:03.560 --> 01:44:08.720]  great law giver yeah and so here this guy we wrote all about him so we sent
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:13.320]  out a piece we also had in that piece remember the guy was we wrote about the
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.660]  weenie mobile we wrote about the other wiener Richard wiener the guy that got
[01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:23.840]  caught you know shown his stuff off on TV on the internet we wrote about both
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:29.280]  them you should see this is a year ago people writing to us canceling their
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:36.440]  subscriptions because we said what they didn't like about Ryan we could go after
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:42.360]  Obama they don't care but you go after their ideologue and boy do they get
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:47.640]  tight if you don't like their freak there's something wrong with you my
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:52.200]  freak is better than your freak oh the Romney freak is better than them than
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:56.320]  the than the Obama freak how come you don't like my freak it's a freak show
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:00.800]  how could any adult look at this adolescent act that they call the
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:07.400]  presidential reality show and buy into it it's a disgrace
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:15.320]  well said shifting gears to the war front and other areas that deal with
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.840]  that Syrian rebels who've always been Al Qaeda led warm they will turn to Al
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:24.200]  Qaeda if the West fails them and they also say that our troops have to grow
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.280]  the opium or Al Qaeda will get it I mean I guess now they'll need your
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:31.160]  daughters as well or Al Qaeda will get them you know let the globalists have
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.040]  their way with them or Al Qaeda will pill for them now continuing Israel
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.560]  urges US decision on Iran strike why net news here's another one Israel
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.240]  minister warns of 30-day war with Iran you mentioned mentioned that the start
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.800]  of the interview Khomeini Zionist regime will disappear from map Israel
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.160]  military blast heard in southern city rockets believed to be falling seven
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:54.960]  American soldiers get an Afghan chopper crash they never get shot down it's
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:01.400]  always a chopper crash yeah continuing all of this is going on and then the
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:06.000]  economic news even Fox News runs the headline the coming economic collapse
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.640]  and breaks down the numbers again they've always known this because there's
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:15.240]  that they're imploding it to take over but the fact that they're now admitting
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.440]  they're getting ready for a collapse what's your time frame on that I know
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.560]  you're in generalities because no one knows exactly but I mean we're talking
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:26.760]  about this fall next year Max Kaiser says by next April because they happen it
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:30.520]  could happen it could happen next week they see they keep coming up with these
[01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:36.040]  schemes like nobody knew about the 26 trillion dollars that the Fed was
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:40.240]  pumping into the system nobody knew that they were rigging the rates and lying
[01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:44.600]  about with LIBOR to cover up the show it's all right it's all right but the
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:48.920]  but but the real economy is dying yeah so the timeline is really really
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.640]  difficult to go on but he is like you know you mentioned about you know how
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.560]  the media looks at me you know I know people in the media and they all tell
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.760]  me you know I have friends that you know that are agents and different people
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:03.960]  and they say every time they mentioned my name they say no no no you know wait
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.600]  he scares people what he has to say you know we don't we don't we don't want to
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:20.440]  hear that you know he unsettles people oh what exactly that's a badge of
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.720]  distinction and honor a red badge of courage that I've I've had Wall Street
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.480]  Journal New York Times Washington Post all with reporters here to the point of
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:34.080]  now I go no you can't come to a profile I don't care of your editor said it's
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.800]  allowed to go out people above that will kill it because they think not
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:41.840]  recognizing us keeps us down it's the opposite if you ever recognize this it
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.360]  would hurt us you are you are like poison garbage you're the plague I'm
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.080]  running from you and the point is is they always call back after they've
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:53.960]  been here and they go you're right they killed it from the corporate above the
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:58.040]  editors and I'm like exactly so now I say oh the editor says you can come to
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.360]  town I know it's a hit piece I don't mind a hit piece that helps me when you
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.920]  attack me but I said do this have your editor go above the corporate just so
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:08.960]  and they go oh my gosh you're right I had the Washington Post call me two
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:12.320]  weeks ago you know this big writer and I'm like oh no anything I've ever done
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:15.640]  gets published I said okay go ahead and write your article he goes it'll be this
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:20.640]  Sunday you watch never was in the paper because again they're scared and they
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.360]  act like we're the ones destroying confidence no no no the Chinese
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.840]  government won't buy us stocks anymore because they know it's rigged that's
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.600]  why we're not the way in fact I get this a lot I see this about you but I get
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:37.560]  this a lot I'm causing the problems I'm the reason there's a loss of confidence
[01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:41.600]  don't listen to that guy or we'll have a depression hey I got news for you four

[01:54:52.120 --> 01:55:00.640]  twitter.com forward slash real Alex Jones Dave Mustaine to clarify I'm having
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.160]  to write this on there right now I'm having a multi-test like nobody you
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:07.840]  know folks I'm like a cook dishwasher waiter you name it around here I mean
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:10.800]  basically you've seen the headlines I would Dave Mustaine we're going back to
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:14.360]  Joel Salenta here in just a moment basically the tweet I'm gonna put out
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:17.920]  is because I know Chrissy's in there listening about to send it out pretty
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:20.240]  much all the tweets I end up writing them but sometimes I write them like
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.360]  telling somebody what to tweet out I'm going to basically you know what I'll
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:29.560]  give her that tweet in a moment after I can codify my thoughts I'll do that
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:34.080]  during the break I'll I'll just tweet it myself shoot going back to Joel Salenta
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:37.160]  Gerald thank you so much for the time of day we got five minutes left here I've
[01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:41.440]  asked a lot of the questions what else is front and center on your radar right
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:45.200]  now that you'd like to tell people about well the big one of course is what's
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:49.800]  going on in the Middle East another one September 12th is going to be a big day
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:55.800]  you asked me the timeline on collapse that's the day that the German Supreme
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:02.000]  Court is supposed to rule on whether or not it's constitutional for the German
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.960]  government to be into the mechanisms they call them that are dumping all of
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:13.520]  this funneling all this money into bail out the troubled countries if this and
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:18.600]  it's also another element of that that lawsuit that they'll be deciding and the
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:24.600]  German Supreme Court ostensibly isn't a political is not a politically rigged
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:29.640]  court like the one we have here that's what they say we'll see by their deeds
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:36.000]  and the other issue is whether or not the Germans are actually going to lose
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.880]  their sovereignty as well as the rest of the Europeans by putting the banking
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:48.080]  structures completely into Brussels so how the Supreme Court of Germany rules
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:54.600]  on August excuse me September 12th on whether or not they could continue in
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:59.600]  these bailout funds and these emergency funds and these bond buying schemes is
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:07.880]  going to determine the future of the euro because if they say which it is by
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:15.600]  the way unconstitutional as it is established by the German Constitution
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:21.240]  to continue like this Germany's the only one holding it up that means the whole
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:28.680]  euro zone collapses number two again I am not giving financial advice just to
[01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:35.880]  make this clear my timeline on gold gold today is up about $13 as we speak
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:45.240]  gold has to break above 1670 I believe it's about 16 you know 13 now it has to
[01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:53.560]  go about 1670 and then the next hit up to that is 1750 once it goes over 1750
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:58:01.560]  it's back to the 2000 mark and it could happen overnight particularly if the
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:07.920]  psychopaths start a war with Iran I've said it before I'll say it again and I
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:15.480]  will say it over and over again this will begin world war three the entire Middle
[01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:21.480]  East will explode you know how now that Al Qaeda is fighting against the Assad
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:29.240]  regime and Syrian on and on they will all unite Sunni Shia a la what Christian
[01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:35.760]  they will all unite against Israel if Israel I tell you what I tell you what

[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000]  trends journal.com trends research.com finishing up you were getting into the
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.600]  chain reaction of World War three that could be triggered by unifying the
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:15.880]  Arabs if there's an attack on Iran that's why most of the people in the
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:19.920]  Israeli military know it's not a good idea you also have the globalist trying
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:27.960]  to launch a proxy war using al Qaeda against Shiites and people in different
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:30.880]  areas of the Middle East so the globalists want a civil war but you're
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:35.360]  saying an Iran war will bring them together. Oh you're saying that all
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.920]  better when saying you know me against my brother my brother and I against our
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:47.760]  and our cousin my brother my cousin and I against our neighbor and all of us
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:52.360]  against the foreigner you know I'm not making this up this is as old as history
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:58.280]  and that's why it will be it will be and the entire Middle East will go up in
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:03.440]  flames it's already going up look what's going on over in Egypt look at
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.440]  Tunisia go over to Morocco look at Bahrain look at Yemen look at Syria if
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:16.400]  they explode this it's it's in flames it's only a madman would conceive this
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.360]  and there are plenty of them out there to conceive it they're called politicians
[02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:27.360]  presidents chancellors all of the rest of them prime ministers psychopaths
[02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:35.040]  sociopaths megalomaniacs vote don't forget to vote what's the time frame do
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.800]  you think on an Iran strike do you think they're getting closer to that or is
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:42.360]  there a way to stop it you know I just did an interview with an Israeli in the
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:47.640]  Israeli press the people they are very concerned and there's an element in this
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.640]  and again you can't put the timeline on again it's all politics and right now
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:59.880]  Netanyahu 60 over 60 percent of the people disapprove of him so they do
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.920]  desperate things because these people again there they range between psychopath
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:08.320]  megalomaniacs sociopaths and and no bodies they want to be some bodies
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:12.800]  they're all power hungry so I don't know the timeline the timeline that's being
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:19.120]  reported is before November 6th all right well Gerald Salente thank you so much

[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.120]  and get some basic sanity and hopefully sane people will start getting
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:36.680]  involved we can take the levers of control away from the madmen but we have
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:40.080]  become very decadent like Rome no doubt thank you so much for joining us and

[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:15.440]  after this break and again we have an exclusive interview with Dave Mustaine
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:19.920]  with a clarifying a statement about Obama being behind the mass shootings that
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:23.520]  will be coming up the last 10 minutes but for the next 45 minutes or so we
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:28.560]  come back from break we are going to be joined by a guest exposing very similar
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:31.760]  things to what Dave Mustaine is talking about but dealing with the killings of
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:37.560]  RFK JFK MLK Marilyn Monroe and others it's a powerful book and in hindsight the
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:42.720]  evidence of staged events is extremely clear we'll be right back I'm Alex Jones
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:46.640]  our websites where we're streaming live video the radio show is prison planet

[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:17.720]  impacted raising prices the cost of heat livestock is forcing farmers and
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:21.280]  ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:25.360]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:29.920]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:33.560]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I

[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:10.480]  you try to spend time with your family but you're on a mission and I understand
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:14.600]  to believe me I've run into some of the same things that you have run into over
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:18.640]  the years in terms of censorship and you know mysterious things happening but
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:23.960]  we're brothers now Alex so thank you for having me well I am blown away because
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.520]  obviously I've enjoyed so many of your films the big TV shows that you're doing
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:32.480]  including the current one on the website is I be ELZ.com is that the best
[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:38.720]  website I bells but you know Alex if I may Bells is book.com because I'm you
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:42.520]  know I want people to really I feel a civic responsibility I mean you know
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:47.360]  Jesse very well and you know that well both of you guys I mean I think we're
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.480]  on the same team here we're disappointed you know people say I hate
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.400]  America I don't hate America I'm disappointed in the system and I want
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:59.920]  the reason I wrote this book you know I've written novels Alex and I've written
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:03.960]  nonfiction books but they're put in like the you know entertainment section or
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:09.240]  the comedy section I purposely did this book as a history book I used to be a
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.160]  newspaper reporter David Wayne is a scholar he's a microanalyst of media
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:18.720]  events he has studied for decades how the media and this is right up your alley
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:25.200]  Alex how the media covers events and I've covered and his foot now here this is
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:30.600]  what this is another reason I admire you you back it up I mean you're you back up
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:35.040]  what you say you have cited things that I thought I only knew or you know like a
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:39.360]  freedom of information act or speech someone gave an old magazine article or
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:47.480]  I mean you thank you for kind of fortifying on my research and there I
[02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:52.200]  mean you blow my mind almost every day man I mean and it's just great to be
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:55.960]  on the show with you oh Richard please please tell us about your awakening I
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.600]  mean I'm sure it's been going on for decades and and and why you decided to
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.720]  write this book obviously for our listeners you don't really need any
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:08.720]  introduction but I mean this side of you though I mean so people understand yeah
[02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:13.520]  sure well I you know when they exploded John Kennedy's head and brought daylight
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:21.800]  I was in college and it just that kind of woke me up a little bit you know I
[02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:26.160]  followed that very closely and then I kind of went dormant and then when
[02:12:26.160 --> 02:12:31.400]  Watergate happened Alex the same names popped up that were in the Bay of Pigs
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:35.520]  that were involved in the Kennedy murder you know the permanent national
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:39.840]  security state reared its ugly head and that was around the time I became
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:44.880]  friendly with Gore Vidal who's a rest in peace who is one of the foremost
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:49.200]  scholars on what happened to this country when Harry Truman in December of
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:54.000]  1947 signed the National Security Act and turned us into this paranoid arms
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:58.000]  state spending trillions of dollars on borrowed money against an empire in
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:03.440]  decline Russia but the reason I wrote this current book Alex is because a lot
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.560]  of people roll their eyes at me sometimes I sure you've seen that it
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.000]  happens to you when you'd say the government kills people or the government
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.440]  lies for that there's side wars or that CNN actually had guys coming over from
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:20.640]  Fort Detrick telling them how to do the news and I mean you're into all this
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:25.840]  stuff the reason I wrote this book with David Wayne is because as an FBI agent
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.800]  who we interviewed said I have no theories just facts and as you know Alex
[02:13:30.800 --> 02:13:34.640]  better than anyone we don't have to make anything up the world is scary and
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:39.080]  fascinating and wonderful in its own right it's very complex most people in
[02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:42.680]  their day-to-day life can't read 20 newspapers and you know they don't have
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:47.800]  staff and I mean you're you're performing a civic duty and because I'm an
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:52.000]  actor I have a lot of downtime I've been taking notes for years and then Sky
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:56.240]  Horse called me about David Wayne wanting to work with me and it was you
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:03.080]  know this and I'm this is not hyperbole Alex this book is at the risk of being
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:07.360]  a modest I'm more proud of this and I mean I I'm an actor I'm a comedian and
[02:14:07.360 --> 02:14:10.600]  I'm certainly proud of that but this book means more to me than I think
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:16.120]  anything right now during this moment in history at the zeitgeist and because
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:20.480]  I'm famous I can put this book out and people will read it that wouldn't read
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:26.440]  it if my name wasn't on it so you know it's I'm using my celebrity to to make
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:32.840]  the electorate informed so they can know how I mean they know but I mean to get
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:38.240]  the spineless Congress who has a 10% approval rating you know it's Jefferson's
[02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:42.560]  idea was that the people that the pyramid has been inverted Jefferson's
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:48.720]  ideas that you rule from the from the bottom up but somehow the elites have
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:53.280]  switched it and the the people's voice is gone you know as you know Alex in the
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:56.560]  early days senators it was a gentlemanly thing you know they go back to their
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:01.160]  homes and they'd come and I mean it was even though they were slave owners and
[02:15:01.160 --> 02:15:06.760]  you know they had some you know Jefferson was a genius and thank God
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:12.200]  Jefferson came back from France when they were writing the Constitution because
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.640]  he was inspired by the French Revolution and when he came back he said
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:20.280]  there's no bill of rights what about people's property what about the right
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:25.160]  to bear arms what about so you know Jefferson saved this country in a way
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:30.400]  because Madison and Hamilton thought that people you know have to be
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.640]  controlled and they were very patronizing and Jefferson he was an
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:39.720]  elitist but he understood you know I mean Jeffersonian democracy is a real
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:43.600]  brilliant as you know concept he believed in the beautiful power of the
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:47.600]  yeoman farmer and their families the people in the dirt people that really
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:51.560]  worked for a living he believed in the general knowledge of the crowd and
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:57.320]  really disdained the corrupt type of European arrogant disconnected elites
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:02.160]  and he said the Western elites should learn from the people at the grassroots
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:08.000]  exactly right he was a farmer he was a transcendentalist he rewrote the Bible
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.640]  and took out all the miracles because it is you know it's a great inspiring work
[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:17.600]  I mean he was a fascinating guy and it's ironic that you know in the
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.240]  Constitution it says all men are created equal except you know Indians or
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:25.200]  savages and blacks or two-thirds of a person and women can own property or
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:34.960]  vote but ironically Alex his term freedom and has been used by blacks
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:40.800]  women and gays you know all men are created equal that came back kind of not
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.880]  to haunt Jefferson but that term has been used by all these groups and right
[02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:50.040]  fully so if I just may say one more quick thing before I get into my book
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:56.000]  when Jefferson said when they wrote the pursuit of happiness that was not a light
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.920]  concept and the government and the commons and you know we're supposed to
[02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:07.080]  share responsibility and share the lands and I mean we can develop the land
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:10.800]  but certainly there has to be land that everyone can share in like public parks
[02:17:10.800 --> 02:17:18.320]  and stuff but the whole concept of Jefferson democracy is that it's not
[02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:23.800]  the Hobbesian thing of every man for himself and he had a fight for that so
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:31.840]  anyway my book is straight facts and I must say that I thought I knew a lot
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:36.480]  about these subjects but David Wayne really took me to school and I was so
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:40.760]  flattered that Jesse wrote the afterward because I'm a big fan of his books and
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:44.800]  his writing the thing that's scary about this book Alex is I've done a few
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:50.800]  interviews already and no one can punch holes in it and that's why I wrote it
[02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:55.840]  because I'm a comedian I'm an actor they can try to marginalize me and call me
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:18:00.000]  you know the Jew liberal from New York or you know whatever they want to call me
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.480]  I don't care my role is to use my celebrity to tell people that not only
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:09.640]  does the government have its eyes on you they're looking at you through a
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:15.600]  telescopic sight and you know you're very much into the technology like this
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:19.920]  computer on now even when it's off they know where we are you know phones I'm
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:24.400]  at my friend I'm with my friend Chris Walken we're doing a cooking thing for
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:31.640]  funny or die and Chris's house he doesn't have a computer or a cell phone so
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:38.000]  dig it Alex he's not on any of Google's maps isn't that interesting wow wow well
[02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:42.840]  you know I've tried to do that now at we can you and I can't we're finished I
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:49.680]  mean we're we're public now well that's amazing I want to get into the book some
[02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:54.000]  because I'm sorry I'm ranting no no no no are you kidding I want to have you back
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:57.320]  next week for two hours if you got the time sir we're we're just flattered to
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:19:00.920]  have you here and I mean all the points you're bringing up is bring up so many
[02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:03.840]  others that I'd like to interject I'm the king of interrupting so I'm kind of
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:07.520]  just sitting here and shutting up no no you don't want to invite me to interrupt
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:12.680]  Richard if you do that it's all over but continuing here we're about to go to
[02:19:12.680 --> 02:19:16.640]  break when we come back I want to look some at the book because this is a coup
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:21.840]  d'etat against people and thinkers and ideas that were threatening the power
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:25.720]  structure I mean they assassinated a bunch of people did it in broad daylight
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:31.160]  and tried to cover it up but they left their tracks so looking at this looking
[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:34.920]  at your book is a roadmap to understand our present and our future so I want to
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:38.880]  get into the book that I can't wait to read like I got it a few weeks a week and
[02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:42.080]  a half ago been trying to read it because you know you think you know all
[02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:45.240]  this stuff folks are reading it it reminded me of stuff I'd forgotten but a
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:48.560]  lot of stuff I didn't know and I was looking it up it's Richard Belzer's

[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:06.560]  that reverse technology that we all know even when it's off they know where we
[02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  are and he's one of the few people I know and on the earth that has managed to
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:15.120]  do that I mean we have to do it we're in media but you know he can go to a movie

[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:33.520]  who are part of the dark force and it's I just feel that you and me and Jesse and
[02:35:33.520 --> 02:35:38.240]  this is like you know we're the Paul reviewers of the internet I mean we have
[02:35:38.240 --> 02:35:43.440]  to alarm alert people I know they're busy and they're obsessed with maybe getting
[02:35:43.440 --> 02:35:47.920]  thrown out of their house and the banksters as you call them which I love
[02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:56.400]  did you ever see the documentary Cy war Alex well expand on that briefly there's
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:02.360]  a documentary by an English documentary that is one of the most amazing thing
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:07.320]  and it's it's like I think it's only a year or two old you just go on you know
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:13.800]  YouTube and put in Cy war one word full movie sure I know what psychological
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:16.920]  warfare is I think I've heard of that movie tell me about it this movie it
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:21.360]  talks about the invention of public relations in 1914 when the Rockefellers
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:25.920]  oh yeah Edward Bernays yeah yeah well they talk about him and they talk about
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:32.800]  how he and and his minions figured out that propaganda can be used to sell
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:40.960]  products and Bernays was Freud's nephew so he used psychological insight to
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:46.120]  manipulate humanity because he like a lot of elites look down upon us they
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.440]  look down upon the people they think that we're you know we need to be
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:55.360]  controlled and it's disgusting but mark that have your people mark that down
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:59.600]  that's a must for you man I'm telling you you're gonna go crazy the footage is
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:03.880]  astounding there's a guy at the BBC who they gave permission to go into their
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:09.480]  archives and do anything he wanted but it don't yeah and he's found the most
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:13.960]  amazing footage anyway it's the reason I'm going on about it's because it's
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.040]  right up our alley and at this timing now the zeitgeist I think you know I
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:24.160]  agree with you that we're finally you know I I say that George Orwell was
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:29.360]  kind of wrong because 1984 goes both ways they can see us but we can see them
[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:33.440]  now and the government's really worried about as you know they're trying to
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.120]  screw around with the internet so my book I the style that it's written in is
[02:37:38.120 --> 02:37:42.920]  very I'm very cognizant that people have no time so it's very punchy it's very
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:48.800]  it's like a murder mystery but you can't put it down I have all the greatest
[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:56.480]  footnotes thanks to my partner and timelines FBI agents forensic evidence
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:02.360]  scholars scientists it's irrefutable it is irrefutable the police report with
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.880]  the RFK deal I mean that this is why I've tried to shut up here is they held
[02:38:06.880 --> 02:38:10.200]  his arm down he didn't shoot him they knew it was a different caliber we know
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:14.800]  who shot him and it's the same in every case they're so ham-fisted because they
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:20.280]  controlled the media then they could do anything they wanted so listen listen
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:23.800]  this weekend this weekend I've got Saturday and part of Sunday off I'm not
[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:27.240]  just saying this to hype it up there's going to be something I'm sitting down
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:31.200]  with all my kids sit there and play board games and it's going to be dead
[02:38:31.200 --> 02:38:36.000]  wrong because again as I said I started reading just the first chapter it is
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:40.920]  very well written and incredibly researched everybody has got to read
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:44.880]  dead wrong thank you Alex it's going to blow your mind and I don't use that
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:51.880]  term lightly the reactions of the book is fortunately and quite amazing and I
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:56.840]  think we're you know with your help we can build on this momentum and get and
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:01.000]  David Wayne and I are writing another book called hit list about all the people
[02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:06.400]  that died after Kennedy's murder you know so we're gonna we're gonna keep
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:12.040]  doing books but the style of this book is it's incredible I'm not you know I
[02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:16.360]  have to sell it but it's really is very readable and you know I've read it a lot
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:20.920]  obviously but the way it's laid out as you know Alex we just show you know the
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:24.800]  official verdict the actual circumstances then inconsistencies and then we
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:31.640]  break it down and it was really uncanny because David Wayne and I we have a
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:36.640]  similar writing style so it was like the gods are smiled on us or something when
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:41.240]  when we talk on the phone or emails me his sense of humor his writing style no
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:44.400]  you guys clicked I mean people that are into truth and liberty and freedom it
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:50.080]  just clicks yeah that's exactly right and he was quoting one of my quotes from a
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:54.200]  book before ever met me that he was sign off all his letters with my quote
[02:39:54.200 --> 02:39:58.080]  which was 90% of the people in the United States believe that John Kennedy
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:04.120]  was killed by a conspiracy the other 10% work for the government or the media no
[02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:08.560]  no no mean joke but you know no no no but you're absolutely right I've done
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:14.360]  an index of polls over 90% over 90 usually about 91 92 and scientific polls
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:20.840]  don't believe it and then the tiny a media elite in government in 8% points
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:27.560]  at us yeah from their Byzantine Hill and tell us we're freaks because we live
[02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:32.200]  in reality yeah well you know what else I am sick of that and I told some I did a
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:36.640]  bunch of radio interviews today you know local stuff and I I have no tolerance
[02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.520]  now for marginalizing this information and that's why I feel the book is so
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:48.480]  bulletproof because no one can refute anything in the book and I'm so proud of
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:53.760]  that and took us a long time but that's why I'm going around ranting like I am
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:41:00.360]  and and because it's you know your your term info wars I mean it's so important
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:04.160]  and the book you know Marilyn Monroe for instance you know there's I think we
[02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:07.840]  have 59 pages on her a lot of people don't know the details of that it's
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:12.600]  fascinating what was going on in her life she didn't commit suicide you know
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:17.280]  she was murdered the first cop on the scene we interviewed said as soon as he
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:20.840]  walked in the door he said staged murder you know like the cops on the scene
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:25.800]  that's what we talked to forensics guys that were told to lie about Marilyn's
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:30.680]  death guys that were told to lie about you know you know feigned Caesar right
[02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:35.280]  I mean Bobby Kennedy had powder burns on his hair Sir Han was 10 feet away with
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:39.360]  Rosie Greer and George Clinton grab in his arm he had an 8 shot pistol there
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:43.200]  were 14 bullets in that pantry as you know and none of you know the bullet and
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:48.160]  Bobby wasn't the same as Sir Han and Sir Han I don't know if you know this out
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:54.520]  but Sir Han was a hypnotic subject which you know but someone found in hypnosis
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:42:00.120]  and in the CIA they call it the key you can you can get a hypnotic subject to
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:05.000]  reveal what happened to them usually they're programmed to forget you know
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.800]  they commit a crime and then they're touched or whatever and they forget but
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:13.560]  they there's a tape of a guy breaking down Sir Han and it's absolutely chilling
[02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:21.320]  and but this book is just you know like Dr. King was clear you know James
[02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:26.440]  Earl Ray never fired a shot he the only reason he pleaded guilty was so they
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:31.480]  wouldn't fry him Dr. King's family believes in me that he wasn't guilty as
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:36.560]  you know that famous photo where they're pointing at the shooter James Earl Ray
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:41.080]  was at the same level as the balcony so it wasn't a straight shot it was you know
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:46.160]  in a downward angle but now with JFK he was photographed at the scene I've
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:51.200]  talked to his son who well I mean now I'm shifting gears to what happened in
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:54.960]  in in in a in ideally plaza I mean I'm jumping around here but it's all in the
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.720]  book but I mean I mean I've interviewed E. Howard Hunt's son who
[02:42:58.720 --> 02:43:03.560]  premiered video and audio here and on coast-to-coast AM where he was
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:08.120]  admitting to it in fact he sued a newspaper when they said he was involved
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:14.000]  and he lost back in the 80s I mean this is incredible we even have the people
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:17.560]  that were famous black-op killers admitting that they were there running
[02:43:17.560 --> 02:43:24.480]  the hit of JFK yeah that's true and you know he had a ear surgery hunt yeah
[02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:28.320]  ears was stood out so much he may have been one of the tramps or he was
[02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:32.680]  definitely there and then what happened Alex was he was on his deathbed he
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:38.280]  thought he was dying and he wrote this chart that you saw when you interviewed
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:44.240]  the son breaking down the hierarchy and the the cabal that murdered Kennedy and
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:49.920]  then he rallied and didn't die that's when he started suing because he told
[02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:54.760]  the truth to his son then he didn't die so he had to cover that up the trial
[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:59.960]  you're talking about was with who was that guy that wrote the first the first
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:06.880]  book about the murder anyway oh there have been so many I mean that's the
[02:44:06.880 --> 02:44:12.000]  problem is that we're we're literally in a sea of evidence I mean I interrupted
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:17.200]  you when you were on the cool the the killing of Martin Luther King I mean
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:22.480]  it's all so incredibly transparent yeah and you know we know I know I now can
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:27.960]  state unequivocally that it was physically impossible for Oswald to have
[02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:33.560]  fired a weapon that day he was having lunch on the first floor he was seen by
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:38.280]  a pregnant woman eight minutes or seven minutes before the murder she remembers
[02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:42.960]  it because she had to go to the bathroom every 20 or 30 minutes two black
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:47.960]  gentlemen who worked at the depository and said they saw him and Lee when he
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:52.600]  was Lee Harvey Oswald when he was the very few notes on that we have of his
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:44:57.000]  interview he mentioned that oh yeah junior no he named the two black guys he
[02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:01.720]  couldn't so the odds of him guessing who was there then he goes to the second
[02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:06.240]  floor and you know as we know got a coke and see officer bear and Mary and
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:11.600]  Barry and Mary and Barry officer the motorcycle patrolman who ran up the
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:15.840]  stairs with Roy truly the manager of the building he's a combat guy he was on
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:20.360]  the cycle motorcycle he heard a shot he knew it came from above he got off his
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:25.120]  bike he ran into the depository so fast that he bumped into Roy truly he was
[02:45:25.120 --> 02:45:32.600]  running up the stairs and truly brought him up ran up the stairs saw Oswald
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:38.640]  through these doors on the second floor calmly drinking a coat now Alex they
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:44.720]  say that Oswald fired three shots with a man liquor car cano rifle which is a
[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:52.800]  joke rifle with a misaligned scope in six seconds as you know and Jesse proved
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:57.880]  this when you sight a bolt-action rifle you have to drop it to pull the bolt and
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:03.160]  then recite there was a tree in the way of the limousine no shooter ever shoots
[02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:07.640]  anybody going away the first shot missed that was the way you said they ride
[02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:11.920]  all these eight thousand page debunker books they could have 20 chimpanzees in
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:16.720]  a room typing it's all I mean hundreds of witnesses hundreds saw the smoke and
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.880]  shooting and guys with rifles and then so hundreds of deaths and people being
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:25.720]  killed and and and his head blowing up and the photos and the brain disappearing
[02:46:25.720 --> 02:46:29.800]  and I interviewed the head of the funeral home when the feds came in to put
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:34.280]  the ink on Oswald's hand and put it on there and then and then he was coming
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:37.560]  back to another interview and guys ran him off the road at 90 something years
[02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:41.600]  old and well he couldn't do the interview yeah I know that story and you
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:47.920]  know they found fingerprints on those boxes at in the so-called sniper's
[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:52.040]  nest none of them were Oswald's and Alex this is gonna blow your mind if you
[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:58.600]  don't know it already guess there's a in the 70s of a very diligent reporter was
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:05.280]  stomach through Dallas police files found fingerprints Mac Wallace Lyndon
[02:47:05.280 --> 02:47:11.160]  Johnson's hit man who we know and proven in court through testimony it was a
[02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:18.320]  murderer his fingerprints were on the box in the sixth floor I don't know what
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:22.000]  that means but I don't think Johnson ordered I think he was told but that's
[02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:26.400]  we'll talk about that more we have more time the details of that but you know
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:31.600]  Mac Wallace's prints are on the box I think that was staged they you know they
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:35.840]  said Oswald never fired a shot so let me just quickly say this Alex I was in
[02:47:35.840 --> 02:47:40.920]  Dallas I went to the museum they allowed me to you know see the
[02:47:40.920 --> 02:47:45.040]  stairs and they don't let you go up to that window but I was close enough to
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:53.040]  see and here's what's so bizarre in this guy Posner wrote the bookcase closed
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:57.760]  with with his false scholarship who ran away from me by the way love this I was
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:03.720]  doing the today show actually Jesse Ventura was on the same day Alex 1999 my
[02:48:03.720 --> 02:48:08.040]  book came out was called UFOs JFK and eldest conspiracies you don't have to
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:12.080]  be crazy to believe I'll send it to you don't have it and by coincidence now I
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:16.400]  think of it Jesse was on that show and Posner was on but we're all separate
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.800]  segments and I couldn't wait to get my hands on posin for lying and and you
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:26.320]  know just forget about what it's criminal what he's done but he ran out they
[02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:30.760]  they said oh he ran out here he heard you were here and then Jesse goes on with
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:34.120]  Matt Lauer says I agree with Richard Bolzer about this you know so that was
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:40.360]  like 99 anyway I'm rambling but oh so let me just go through this because this
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:47.120]  is key I read a lot of the Warren Commission report and they re-enacted
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:53.480]  the soap you know what happened and they had the officer Barry officer Marion
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:59.720]  excuse me his last name patrolman Marion re-enacted but they they they slowed
[02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:05.080]  him down Alex they made him do it slower than I actually did it so keep this in
[02:49:05.080 --> 02:49:10.560]  mind then they had an FBI guy play Oswald and they say that Oswald fired the
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:15.360]  shots ran in a straight line across the sixth floor and wedged the rifle
[02:49:15.360 --> 02:49:20.480]  behind the stack of books okay right there it wasn't a straight line because
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:24.560]  there were books that he would have to zigzag we're talking about seconds that
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:29.120]  would take and then he supposedly gyms the rifle behind the stack of books then
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:33.480]  goes down four flights it's really eight short flights with landings you know how
[02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:38.880]  some staircases have landings sure eight short flights the door to those stairs
[02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:43.040]  is really heavy so I mean I'm not the strongest either well but any person
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.960]  would take a few seconds to open the door even you know Arnold Schwartz and
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:53.360]  asshole whatever so open the door and then go down the four flights or eight
[02:49:53.360 --> 02:49:58.880]  go to the coke machine open it and start sipping it they said he did that all
[02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:05.720]  in 90 or 95 seconds now according to the reenactment but in reality it would
[02:50:05.720 --> 02:50:13.120]  have to been 60 seconds 58 to 65 seconds therefore physically impossible even if
[02:50:13.120 --> 02:50:17.640]  he did fire a shot from that window which he didn't it would be physically
[02:50:17.640 --> 02:50:21.680]  impossible for him to have gotten down the stairs not be out of breath open a
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.400]  coke open that heavy door jam the rifle behind there dodge all these stacks of
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:31.840]  books I mean what pisses me off Alex on my French the utter contempt that the
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:36.960]  elites have for us Richard Belzer this has been one of the most amazing
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:41.640]  interviews ever not just your info but Christopher Walken popping in promise me

[02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:08.040]  rest of your crew there listen here's the Dave Mustain interview I taped during
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:12.720]  the first hour of the show today okay this is Dave Mustain his official
[02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:17.560]  response to the international firestorm over him saying hey they stage fast
[02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:20.600]  and furious they cut a stage some of the other shootings which had all the
[02:51:20.600 --> 02:51:24.280]  evidence of other shooters the media is ignoring that we're gonna put together a
[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:27.920]  whole article breaking it down but here's what Dave Mustain had to say
[02:51:27.920 --> 02:51:32.960]  here is his response premiering here on the syndicated radio transmission if
[02:51:32.960 --> 02:51:35.920]  you even if you don't agree with Dave I agree with him you've got to admire his
[02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:39.760]  courage just like you know the courage of our last guest here because we know
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:43.840]  the system lies to us we'd be idiots to trust everything they have to say here
[02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:51.600]  is his response and joining us on the phone line is the founder of mega death
[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:57.880]  Dave Mustain he wants to clarify and respond to the huge international story
[02:51:57.880 --> 02:52:03.480]  that has broken in the last 24 hours concerning his comments taken out of
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:08.720]  context at an overseas concert concerning the tragic shootings the last
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:13.080]  month here in the United States Dave thanks for being with us I welcome
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:16.760]  Alex just get to be with you Dave they are certainly attacking the First
[02:52:16.760 --> 02:52:21.200]  Amendment and trying to basically twist what you've said from a concert what
[02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:26.000]  did you really mean by what you said Dave well look first off it's gonna be
[02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:30.320]  with you Alex and to clarify things no one can deny that there were criminal
[02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:36.640]  rogues in the administration and and your CBS News got the memos Congress has
[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:41.080]  the information and and basically Larry Pratt the head of gun owners of America
[02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:45.920]  who's a highly respected person said that if they would stage fast and furious
[02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:50.760]  they'd be capable of staging anything and it was all done to blame the Second
[02:52:50.760 --> 02:52:55.280]  Amendment we'd be fools not to look at this you know our US border patrol
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:53:00.080]  agents were killed and like I said I was just quoting Larry Pratt that's it
[02:53:00.080 --> 02:53:04.840]  bottom line I wonder whether or not attacking Larry he's he's been in the
[02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:07.840]  news he's been on my show but he's been a major newspaper saying look
[02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:12.240]  thousands died in Mexico hundreds in the US border patrol agents police
[02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:17.480]  officers and as you said you've done your homework CBS News months ago got the
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:21.400]  memos where they said they were gonna blame the Second Amendment so I think
[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:24.720]  you're clarifying though with that criminal rogue statement that you're
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:29.600]  saying we don't know Obama when we say Obama we mean the administration I mean
[02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:32.360]  clearly people in the administration and they won't release the rest of the
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:37.560]  documents they're covering up they did do this they did stage a false flag so is
[02:53:37.560 --> 02:53:40.280]  that what you're clarifying that you're saying somebody in the
[02:53:40.280 --> 02:53:43.880]  administration could have been behind this right you know when you're in the
[02:53:43.880 --> 02:53:48.200]  heat of the moment when you're on stage and you're talking you know sometimes
[02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:52.680]  you're not as eloquent as you'd like to be but like I said I was just quoting
[02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:58.200]  what Larry said and and you know we really need to investigate this and we
[02:53:58.200 --> 02:54:02.560]  need to have the Attorney General release the documents and find out who's
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:08.320]  responsible for this people died you know and and the democratic process is
[02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:12.480]  let's investigate let's find out what's going on here I love our country you
[02:54:12.480 --> 02:54:20.120]  know and I respect and you know my whole thing with this is that I think we
[02:54:20.120 --> 02:54:25.960]  should just look into it well I'm gonna air this here on the radio Dave and I'm
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:30.360]  gonna add to it the fact that a bunch of Democratic strategist have set on
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:34.440]  hardball but also in memos that a mass shooting would help them quote
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:38.760]  reconnect with the public and we were talking just last week on the phone when
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:42.440]  you were overseas with me we were talking about the fact that the witnesses
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:45.440]  the president of the Sikh groups so they were being cased by multiple men
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:50.880]  multiple witnesses reported up to four shooters I mean we'd be crazy not to
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:55.280]  question the fact that with the Batman tragedy and the Sikh tragedy it doesn't
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:55:00.400]  add up yeah there's some there's some questions here you know I just think
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.760]  that we deserve to know the truth that's it well you have a lot of courage
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:07.520]  that's why they took this video you up there in the heat of the moment on the
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:11.600]  stage tongue-in-cheek and tried to twist it they want to attack the First
[02:55:11.600 --> 02:55:15.800]  Amendment and shut us up so we don't look at fast and furious Dave Mustaine of
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:20.240]  mega death any other points you'd like to add no just you know I'm a patriot I
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:23.360]  love our country you know I've always been controversial I'm a political song
[02:55:23.360 --> 02:55:29.800]  writer and and this wasn't done to hurt any of my fellow countrymen you know I
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:35.840]  think that it's it's something we really really need to look into well said
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:39.600]  and again national media you want to attack Dave Mustaine this is gonna
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:45.400]  backfire on you here's a clip of Larry Pratt on my show weeks ago saying what
[02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:49.920]  Dave Mustaine said but he's got millions and millions of supporters in the
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:54.920]  Second Amendment community he's a Fox News contributing guest they're scared to
[02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:58.200]  go after Larry Pratt I think this is gonna blow up in their face here's a
[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:01.120]  clip of Larry Pratt
[02:56:02.320 --> 02:56:07.880]  what does your gut tell you and and and now a week later in the aftermath what
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:11.960]  is the intel you've got on this shooting in Colorado am I wrong for being
[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:16.760]  suspicious I don't think you're wrong I would have disagreed with you before
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:22.760]  fast and furious because I never in my wildest fears would have thought that
[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:27.200]  our government would actually premeditatedly kill some 400 Mexicans
[02:56:27.200 --> 02:56:33.280]  have been murdered and a couple of our US agents so after we caught them
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:39.240]  planning premeditatedly for a program that would get people murdered one of
[02:56:39.240 --> 02:56:46.160]  the whistleblowers submitted a report on weekly briefings at ATF and when the
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:49.960]  head of the ATF at the time would be given the increase in body counts in
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:55.760]  Mexico he would say things like good the program's working well so this was no
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:57:01.520]  mistake this was not a sting operation gone bad this was premeditated murder
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:06.560]  well if our government would do that then even though I think the evil of the
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:09.800]  human heart is sufficient to account for somebody that wants to go and shoot
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:14.720]  people at random we've had since we've been keeping records in this country this
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:19.840]  has happened every few years since the 1870s 10 20 30 people being murdered at
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:24.920]  a time by the long before semi-automatics were available to people so
[02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:32.680]  this is what human beings are capable of and now we have to admit that maybe
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:36.640]  this is something that our government is capable of because this is only 12
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:47.480]  people murdered they were good for 400 and fast and furious wow my friends we
[02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:50.560]  need to support governors of America for their courage we need to support Dave
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.360]  Mustaine and mega death for his courage we need to spread the word about what
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:57:58.440]  they're doing there's gonna be a big orchestrated backlash of political
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:02.200]  correctness because they know people are waking up try to shut down free speech
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:06.880]  so support mega death just like people supported Chick-fil-A by their great new
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:11.960]  record 13 go to their website and financially get behind them even if
[02:58:11.960 --> 02:58:15.160]  you don't agree with these statements completely agree with the First
[02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:18.720]  Amendment even if you didn't agree with the Dixie chicks they shouldn't have been
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:22.800]  persecuted for saying the Iraq war was wrong we need to support the First
[02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:28.000]  Amendment and stop these witch hunts Dave Mustaine I admire you because you've
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:33.720]  got guts and guts is enough all right folks that's it Dave Mustaine
[02:58:33.720 --> 02:58:39.400]  Christopher Walken and many others like Richard Bells they're on the show today
[02:58:39.400 --> 02:58:45.520]  great job to the crew thank you for listening to GCN support Dave Mustaine
[02:58:45.520 --> 02:58:58.480]  the first amendment you see and live calm today
