[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  The time to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's 4-4.
[00:46.000 --> 00:56.000]  Already, the fourth day of April 2017.
[01:01.000 --> 01:10.000]  The plot is thickening and President Donald John Trump is striking back against the globalist. It is a very, very exciting time to be alive.
[01:10.000 --> 01:25.000]  Isn't it funny how fate works? Mike Cernovich, who is a lawyer and filmmaker and a activist the last few years really exploding onto the scene with his dogged determination to take on tyranny,
[01:26.000 --> 01:34.000]  was profiled a week and a half ago in 60 minutes as the ultimate fake news prepared because he reported Hillary Clinton fell down and was ill.
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.000]  And then they didn't show the full video of her falling down, only showed her wobbling. Wow, very impressive 60 minutes.
[01:44.000 --> 01:53.000]  Danger and play. It's his website. Guess what happens then? Yesterday, we covered it some, but I didn't realize how big it would be,
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  how the media would panic and go into damage mode because we've known Susan Rice was involved. That's who's over it.
[02:00.000 --> 02:09.000]  They bragged in the New York Times on March 1st that Obama was saving all the evidence and ferreting it away illegally.
[02:10.000 --> 02:16.000]  But see, there is no evidence. They just keep saying, we have the evidence and then Trump says, oh, you have evidence and you've illegally leaked it.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  Let us see the evidence. The president has access to everything. He knows there is no evidence.
[02:21.000 --> 02:36.000]  So then folks inside Bloomberg know that this is all being sat on for months and who exactly leaked it and then who pervaded.
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  We have all the names and then the purveyor of it is so arrogant. She goes on TV last week and admits that they were spying.
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  And it turns out a month before that, she said they were spying on him. It's incredible.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  Evelyn Farkas, head of the State Department and Pentagon's Russia operations.
[03:02.000 --> 03:07.000]  So they're admitting they're doing it in the newspapers. Then they say they weren't.
[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  And then Bloomberg is sitting on top of the story and Cernovich hasn't told me this, but I know some of the same people.
[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  That gets leaked to him. They have the full story waiting, laying there on their desk.
[03:22.000 --> 03:29.000]  And because the information gets leaked, boom, it comes out that yes, Bloomberg's forced to report.
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  We're talking an hour after Cernovich put it out. They're forced to admit that indeed she gave the orders
[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  and that they had detailed breakdowns on everything that the entire Trump operation was doing.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  And you know they were doing it during the campaign too, ladies and gentlemen. Read all the WikiLeaks.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  They've got everybody under surveillance. I've come out in federal wiretaps.
[03:52.000 --> 04:00.000]  So has Roger Stone. I had to get rid of so many phones. They get on my phone, start calling people, start going to websites,
[04:01.000 --> 04:05.000]  start doing things in live times. Sometimes I'll wake up, the phone's turned on and it will be going places.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  People say, well, why do you have one of these horrible things? I think Matt Drudge is right.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  I should just get rid of it, just go back to a flip phone. Problem is I can do so much with it.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  If it wasn't filled with all this crap, all these Trojan horses, but here they are caught red-handed
[04:18.000 --> 04:27.000]  and then you notice the key words that are used by people like Chris Como.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  He calls it a fake scandal. Does it call it fake news? He calls it a fake scandal.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  Does it call it a hoax? A fake scandal. Oh, so this whole scandal's fake. Can't say the story's fake.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  Just the whole, it's a scandal. No, it's a scandal that you're a bunch of whores selling this country out
[04:48.000 --> 04:54.000]  and that you think we're all stupid and that you're better than us, Como, you and your bully brother.
[04:54.000 --> 05:21.000]  Well, fill your hand, you un-American piece of trash.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  Good afternoon, we got the manufactured Blackwater found secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump-Putin back channel.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  That's right, Trump-Putin back channel could be found in thousands of articles all released within two hours of each other
[05:34.000 --> 05:41.000]  and they claim that Eric Prince of Blackwater was having secret meetings at an Indian Ocean Island with Russia to set up a secret back channel with Putin.
[05:41.000 --> 05:51.000]  The proof we do have are the NSA request logs with Susan Rice's name all over them which is asking for the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates
[05:51.000 --> 06:11.000]  so she, Obama and others could spy on them. Rob Dew reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[08:24.000 --> 08:30.000]  The first report to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  It is a big idea. A neutral order.
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  It was almost as if you were planned in force to get just pancakes.
[08:43.000 --> 09:01.000]  Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[09:01.000 --> 09:15.000]  I also believe a lot of governments agree that the AK-47 is the one with the hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  The city's global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge.
[09:25.000 --> 09:27.000]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[09:27.000 --> 09:33.000]  1776 will commence again. If you're proud to take our firearms, do you understand?
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  I don't do like CNN, MSNBC and other globalist media outlets do.
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  When Trump's in crisis and when Trump's starting to slide backwards, I'll tell you.
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.000]  That's been happening the last few weeks.
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  But I can smell it and I can see it and I can taste it and I can feel it in the wind.
[10:05.000 --> 10:13.000]  I can intellectually analyze it. The whole house of cards is starting to completely tumble on the Democrats and on George Soros.
[10:13.000 --> 10:27.000]  And massive momentum has shifted against them because moles inside the major corporate media that are patriots are beginning to leak everything.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  They're beginning to record the executives telling them how to lie.
[10:32.000 --> 10:42.000]  They are beginning to find their conscience and you are now going to see floods of leaks from the corporate media combine.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Like what you just saw with rice.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  And it's better than that.
[10:49.000 --> 10:59.000]  The entire special forces community basically, I mean we're talking 90 plus percent has decided on their own to go operational against the globalist.
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  Way bigger than they did during the campaign.
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  I mean hell you saw Tonto one of the most famous veterans alive say without me prompting, he's ready to go operational.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  They try to overthrow Trump. They're going to hit the streets. They're going to engage.
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  There's no way the globalist can win if Trump just stays the course and they don't kill him.
[11:22.000 --> 11:31.000]  That's why they're trying to undermine him and say he's a fraud and saying he hasn't had success when he's had anything but failure.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  It's been almost total success and ridiculous in the last 74 days what he's gotten done.
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  I don't have to chronicle that again here do I.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  But you need to everybody you know that's still in the dark.
[11:42.000 --> 11:59.000]  It is biblical that Mike Cernovich investigative journalist lawyer filmmaker would be profiled as the epitome of fake news when he's the epitome of cutting edge smart news.
[12:00.000 --> 12:01.000]  The guys got a great brain.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  He gets it. He sees it.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  He's a thin slicer.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  My dad calls it.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  And notice only zero hedge and info wars.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  Of course drudge link to it.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  Gave the guy any credit on the biggest story so far in this whole spy gate Russia gate garbage.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  He got the leak directly from the big outfit.
[12:25.000 --> 12:26.000]  Our intel is it's Bloomberg.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  But he wants to leave his source alone.
[12:28.000 --> 12:44.000]  Bloomberg within an hour of him publishing publishes their own thing confirming everything Cernovich said and no one on the news will even say his name one time on CNN.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  They said oh he's fake news.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  They don't attack the fact that it's a real story or CNN calls it a fake scandal.
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  They don't call it a fake story. They say oh the whole the scandals fake.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  Look at the arrogance of these parasitic sacks of crap to think they're better than everybody else.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  Just look at Como and his dirtbag bully brother.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  They're gonna get put in their place real soon.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  Better believe it.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Running their mouths constantly trying to bankrupt this country.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Pigs.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  He comes out and says it's a fake scandal.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  It's amazing.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen they're on record everywhere.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  In fact I've got the stacks of news.
[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  I was asking for that New York Times back guys from March 1st and all the others.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  Here it is right in front of me.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  Thank you.
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  Obama administration rushed preserve intelligence of Russian election hacking.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  That was all the intel grabbed and Susan Rice is even in these articles.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  And then we've got all the other stories we can put up behind us from January 20th.
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  Wiretaps of Trump Tower.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Here let's put it on screen whenever we get a chance.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Behind me or in front of me.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  I don't care.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  But that's how dumb they think you are.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  And this giant hoax that I was wondering if it would work.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  They put everything they had into this.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  More than saying Hillary was invincible and couldn't be beaten and was 15 points ahead.
[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  And then I knew they were desperate when they said she had 68 points against Trump.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  I mean internal polls where he was 15 points ahead of her.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  CNN was saying that she was 30, 40 points ahead.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  Wiretapping data using an inquiry of Trump aides.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  Oh my gosh.
[14:36.000 --> 14:52.000]  Then two weeks ago we get the secret DEA CIA interface into the NSA of Obama going back eight years spying on Trump, his family and everybody.
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  This is just the targeting orders and the grids so they know where to go in and what's been surveilled.
[14:59.000 --> 15:00.000]  Just a listing.
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.000]  Like a card at the library.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And of course we covered up all the names and the rest of it and then destroyed the information.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  We were only given a small portion of the file.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  But it was real.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  You didn't hear one word out of MSM.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  They didn't touch it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.000]  Oh and guess who else was in there?
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  Alex Jones being spied on.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  Michael Savage.
[15:23.000 --> 15:33.000]  And that was just in a little dump that the sheriff's department of Maricopa County gave us that the FBI's had for multiple years.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Then I had Larry Klayman, you know the lawyer that's beaten the NSA in court.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  Founder of judicial watch.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  I had him on days later to break down the case.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  I mean this is rock solid.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  600 plus million files.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  Did you hear anything about that?
[15:54.000 --> 15:59.000]  That's certified citizen Trump being spied on day one Obama.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  Why? Because they knew the charisma number one TV host in the country.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  They knew he was planning to probably run as a Republican.
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  Of course the Democrats were watching him.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  If you're not getting watched by these criminals, you're not on the field.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Oh and Comey came out and said there was no surveillance.
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.000]  Well he can say that because his agency wasn't the ones doing it.
[16:22.000 --> 16:31.000]  And then he can play dumb because Susan Rice didn't come over and say I'm spying on the president-elect.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  But sees no evidence of wire tapping.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  No notice. Sees no evidence.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  But right in front of his eyeballs?
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  I mean are you allowed to lie when you're like seven feet tall?
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  I mean I'm just wondering is that what he's got going for him?
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Did nothing about Loretta Lynch on the airplane with Bill Clinton illegally?
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  All the rest of the crap we've witnessed.
[16:56.000 --> 17:01.000]  And now he's rolling over to the MSM to piss all over our president and our country.
[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  I've got a bunch of clips I'm going to play.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  We have an incredible list of amazing guests today.
[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  This is another broadcast nobody can miss.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  When we come back I'm going to get into these Susan Rice clips.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  But I want to go ahead and just start getting to some of these right now.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.000]  I want to start with Chris Como.
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  Paul's The Susan Rice Report.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.000]  A fake scandal.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  Again not fake news because it's not fake.
[17:27.000 --> 17:28.000]  Bloomberg admits it real.
[17:29.000 --> 17:30.000]  They sat on it. Others sat on it.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen they also hit it in plain view on March 1st admitting that they were spreading the info.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  That's what's crazy.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.000]  We have the mole that Susan Rice.
[17:41.000 --> 17:49.000]  Then we have the mouth that is Evelyn Farkas who goes on TV and pushes it and says we have the proof.
[17:50.000 --> 17:51.000]  And then goes ooh.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  That's how delusional they are.
[17:57.000 --> 18:04.000]  So here's Chris Como who says if your 12 year old daughter doesn't like to see a man's penis in their showers at school.
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.000]  That she's a transphobe and that you're a bad father.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  He said that three weeks ago.
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  I mean what type of wacko is this guy?
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  His brother says if you own guns or you're pro-life get out of New York you're not welcome here.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  And people said oh you're joking he said no get out of here.
[18:23.000 --> 18:24.000]  How about you get out of here buddy.
[18:25.000 --> 18:28.000]  How about you quit running your fat mouth punk.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.000]  People are sick of people like you.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  We're done getting pushed around and you know it don't you.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  So let's play this piece of trash.
[18:36.000 --> 18:36.000]  Here he is.
[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  President Trump right wing media types peddling a fake scandal.
[18:40.000 --> 18:40.000]  What is it?
[18:41.000 --> 18:51.000]  Well this suggestion that former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice improperly unmasked the identity of Trump associates as part of what our president calls a crooked scheme.
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  An associate of Rice says it's just plain false.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Jim.
[18:57.000 --> 19:06.000]  Oh my gosh maybe we can have Congressman Schiff on to tell us that there was no stand on order in Benghazi and all those heroes are liars.
[19:07.000 --> 19:10.000]  Maybe we can have that guy who's got the biggest lying eyes.
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  I wouldn't believe him if he said the sky was blue.
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  I mean these are obvious pieces of trash.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.000]  The worst people in America pulled up out of the sewage by the globalist to be put in to run over the American people because who would want to do that.
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  Who would want to kill prosperity.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  Who would want to do these snakes.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  Look at that guy.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  That's your enemy on screen.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  TV viewers radio listeners talking about Representative Adam Schiff.
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.000]  When we return I'm going to go into these clips.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  CNN goes on a rampage against Susan Rice bombshell instructs viewers to ignore the story.
[19:46.000 --> 19:53.000]  Talk about mind control CNN dismisses Rice unmasking bombshell as gin-dub distraction.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  They don't call it false just gin-dub distraction and we've got so much more.
[19:57.000 --> 20:26.000]  Stay with us we'll be back.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  The Worldwide Leader in EMF Radiation Protection.
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  A Judeo-Christian online school.

[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  Think about this.
[22:01.000 --> 22:13.000]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  They know water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[24:53.000 --> 25:10.000]  And it goes through Mike Cernovich having his whistleblower inside one of the news agencies where they sat on this and then Bloomberg comes out an hour later and publishes the information.
[25:10.000 --> 25:23.000]  Top Obama advisor sought names of Trump associates in Intel. That's yesterday at 10.13 a.m. Cernovich at 9 something a.m.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, and it just goes over the whole thing. More right-wing fake scandals.
[25:29.000 --> 25:40.000]  But I have all the articles here where before they said they were spying on Trump and unmasking. And that's where they lose the war because they're a bunch of liars.
[25:41.000 --> 25:52.000]  And they built their house on sand and they thought their hoax of them all lining up saying Trump is completely insane. No one was spying on him. Where does he get it?
[25:52.000 --> 26:02.000]  And the Spicer comes in and shows the New York Times headlines that we showed weeks before and the media goes, oh, he got the fake news from Alex Jones.
[26:03.000 --> 26:15.000]  Are you missing that? We're holding up not one, not two, not three, but four articles the week of the 20th saying he was being wiretapped, saying he was being spied on, saying that they had unmasked the names.
[26:15.000 --> 26:24.000]  So they had proof of all this Russian stuff. And then when Trump goes, oh, that's illegal to leak that. Oh, we never did that. We never do that. You're crazy. You're crazy. You're crazy.
[26:25.000 --> 26:35.000]  See how they work? And that's what's scary is they didn't even think it out that far to realize what could happen to him. So now they've got a tiger by the tail.
[26:35.000 --> 26:46.000]  The big news here, though, is that it is imploding on them and this will just be more that they're discredited on.
[26:47.000 --> 26:57.000]  The good news is we have to go back into WikiLeaks and republish all that and bring it all back up and bring up how they lost the election in line about it.
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  All the fake polls and all the colluding with CNN and MSNBC and the WikiLeaks and fixing the news stories and having fake town halls.
[27:05.000 --> 27:14.000]  This is a discredited mob of lying scum. And I can't even believe they've gotten this far with their BS.
[27:14.000 --> 27:26.000]  Let's go to this piece. CNN dismisses Rice unmasking bombshell, ginned up distraction, then they blame it on the intel community.
[27:27.000 --> 27:40.000]  They shouldn't have done this for her. Well, she was in an agency over them with access as a department, one of the most powerful state department.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  We're going to go ahead and go to the clip right now. Here it is.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  Why would someone do this? Every day, they're getting briefings on intelligence.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  Their briefer chooses what they're briefed on, including Ambassador Rice.
[27:55.000 --> 28:01.000]  In those briefings, an official such as Rice might say to further understand it, I'd like to know who those names are.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  Stop right there.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  Just back it up again. I'm going to start over.
[28:05.000 --> 28:14.000]  Do you understand, you've got Anderson Cooper of the left wing Ford Foundation, CIA arm, the literal enemy of this country, that subgroup in the CIA.
[28:15.000 --> 28:24.000]  And you've got this other clown next to him, whose cult is out to create a centralized system of control so they can be in charge.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  Priest of power, priest of control freedom.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  And now they've been telling us for months, we're totally insane, none of this existed.
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  Oh, now it's just a small thing, unmasking in a meeting, no big deal.
[28:35.000 --> 28:41.000]  Yeah, you're going to spy on the president of the United States for your political party and go way beyond anything Nixon ever dreamed of.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  And you're now just going to act like, okay, you know, this really went on, but it's no big deal.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  Well, the rest of CNN saying it's a fake scandal.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  So get it straight.
[28:50.000 --> 28:59.000]  You got your gangster over there, Como, and you got the CIA thug right here, one of the major blue blood fortune owners, just as bad as the EU had.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  I'm sorry, let's go the clip.
[29:04.000 --> 29:05.000]  Why would someone do this?
[29:06.000 --> 29:07.000]  Every day they're getting briefings on intelligence.
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  They're briefer chooses what they're briefed on, including Ambassador Rice in those briefings.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  And officials such as Rice might say, to further understand it, I'd like to know who those names are.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  And that's why they would make that request, which then, as I said, has to be approved by the intelligence community.
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  That's what I'm told.
[29:26.000 --> 29:38.000]  And again, to note by senior intelligence officials who were for both Democrats and Republicans, this appears to be a story largely ginned up partly as a distraction from this larger investigation.
[29:39.000 --> 29:45.000]  But I will say, Anderson, you're aware of this, the investigations continue, but particularly on the House side, there are now questions coming.
[29:46.000 --> 29:47.000]  We'll be back.
[29:47.000 --> 29:56.000]  And Republicans notice he said, oh, partly gender on the March, the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  So after weeks, what is now the largest House Intelligence Committee investigation ever?
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.000]  We get this from Democratic head Adam Schiff.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  I don't think we can say anything definitely at this point.
[30:11.000 --> 30:15.000]  Schiff told Jake Tapper we're at the very early stages of the investigation, so they have nothing.
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  They really have nothing.
[30:17.000 --> 30:21.000]  But let's go back in time to a time when the Democrats were back channeling with the Russians.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  Here's the headline, Ted Kennedy secretly asked the Soviets to intervene in the 1984 elections.
[30:28.000 --> 30:37.000]  According to Soviet documents unearthed in the 1990s, Kennedy literally asked the Soviets, about enemies of the U.S., to intervene on behalf of the Democratic Party in the 1984 elections.
[30:38.000 --> 30:39.000]  So what we have is another piece of evidence.
[30:39.000 --> 30:51.000]  Isn't it funny how we always see the Democrats pointing their finger, making accusations, and then when you do a little looking, it's always the Democrats that are the ones colluding, conniving, and backstabbing.
[30:52.000 --> 30:53.000]  I think Pat Buchanan said it best.
[30:54.000 --> 30:56.000]  They've been investigating this garbage for months.
[30:56.000 --> 31:21.000]  Rob, you're reporting for Infowars.com and Infowars Nightly News.

[32:00.000 --> 32:03.000]  There was a mighty nation, rest above all of creation.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  Individual rights will have to take a backseat to the collective.
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after you're done.
[32:20.000 --> 32:20.000]  Oh, yeah.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  I take it ain't going to sit well down my way at all. It ain't going to sit well.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? They lost. We won.
[32:29.000 --> 32:30.000]  Want to see what Trump's up against.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  It's time to ride, boss. We need a thousand paul with beers.
[32:34.000 --> 32:39.000]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[32:39.000 --> 32:48.000]  And beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand, DVDs now available.
[32:49.000 --> 32:52.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General, Jerry Boykin.

[32:59.000 --> 33:02.000]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[33:29.000 --> 33:35.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  Let me tell you the guest star today, ladies and gentlemen.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  Now that we're 33 minutes into global transmission, Roger Stone in about three minutes is going to be joining us from Florida
[33:52.000 --> 33:59.000]  with big breaking news that I can confirm with my sources as well about the fact there's only a few good people left in the White House.
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  Trump is surrounded by enemies leaking everything.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  And we now know what happened with the healthcare bill.
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  And so much more, we now know what's going on with Nunez and why they're targeting him.
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  And we're going to be talking to Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign and Trump confidant in just a moment.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.000]  Also, Lord Christopher Monkton, we have a young curse, one of the major heirs to the Nazi fortunes.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  The first or second most powerful Nazi family under Hitler who took over Luxembourg in World War II.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.000]  He rules Luxembourg. He's the head of the unelected EU.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  He's threatened war with Europe, European countries war with the United States, economic war if we don't submit to him.
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  And now we've got a bunch of other members of parliament saying the same thing in Spain.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  This is crazy.
[34:45.000 --> 34:52.000]  They're threatening to march EU armies into countries that try to pull out who never voted to enter it.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  Can you say bye-bye? Can you say you really failed now in your arrogance, brother?
[35:00.000 --> 35:09.000]  So Lord Monkton, top advisor to Margaret Thatcher and a guy that helped kill so much of the carbon taxes we see will be joining us.
[35:09.000 --> 35:17.000]  Mike Cernovich, what a hero. A week and a half ago demonized his fake news for saying Hillary fell down and other stuff on 60 Minutes.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  Mike Cernovich got the intel from a leaker inside Bloomberg. He didn't tell me that, I know.
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.000]  Bloomberg an hour later had to admit, okay, yeah, Susan Rice was ordering the illegal spying on President Trump and everybody else, just like Trump told you.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  And just like, see, he's the president, but he's not going to leak national security stuff.
[35:33.000 --> 35:43.000]  He's going to let them sit there and lie knowing everybody in the intelligence community knows and just let them do more rope, more rope scum, more ropes, more rope.
[35:44.000 --> 35:58.000]  Mike Cernovich and then Millie Weaver and crew are in LA investigating the 474 accused pedophiles who were caught with 30 plus women in sex slavery and 28 children and some of them small children in cages.
[35:58.000 --> 36:07.000]  So we're reporting on the fact that pedophilia is rampant across this country in Europe and that people are rolling it up all over and then.
[36:08.000 --> 36:18.000]  I'm going to those 30 minutes of the fourth hour and the day of the night takes over the news blitz. I've got former major SEAL team leader, patriot, dev group, whole nine yards.
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.000]  He's got five TV shows, three of them he stars on, so he's got a lot to lose.
[36:22.000 --> 36:33.000]  It's not like he's some guy just trying to get attention, running a major operation with a bunch of agencies and folks in their private capacities because the media won't cover all the child trafficking and the rest of it.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  They have all the arrest, the intel.
[36:36.000 --> 36:47.000]  He's running an operation to expose that and he got calls from major agencies that we've got the chatter and that they're all panicking and figuring out how to try to take him out or legal action even before he moves.
[36:47.000 --> 36:59.000]  So the pedophiles understand we now to a great extent legally and lawfully because these are targeted groups with no criminal backgrounds are surveilling them and with warrants of course.
[37:00.000 --> 37:01.000]  And I mean that's why they're panicking.
[37:02.000 --> 37:03.000]  We are so close to bringing it all down.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  So get ready for Trump to strike back.
[37:06.000 --> 37:06.000]  This is only the beginning.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  We're going to Roger Stone in a moment.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.000]  We sell his bestselling book.
[37:10.000 --> 37:19.000]  Number one political book at Amazon for months ongoing, I don't know what it is today, the making of the president 2016 and info wars store.com and your purchase is vital.
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  I'm giving $100,000.
[37:22.000 --> 37:22.000]  I gave 10,000.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  They censored his you carrying account when 50,000 hit it in an hour.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  So now he's raised about 100,000, you know, to fund this.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  And I'm talking of course about the sawman, the Navy's field of Patriots, also federal officers, we speak and task forces.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  And so we're going to, I'm going to give another 90,000.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  You don't really have that extra money.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  We're just going to do it and trust the listeners to support us.
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Veterans for child rescue is the site.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  And again, this is just the cost, the money for this large team.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  You can go to the about page about us page.
[37:55.000 --> 37:56.000]  Oh, I was told today, Shane Steiner called me.
[37:57.000 --> 37:57.000]  He tuned into Glenn Beck.
[37:58.000 --> 37:58.000]  We got in his car.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  It was already on 590 and Beck was saying it's number one things going to be child rescue and stopping pedophile rings.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  Now, in my view with Beck's background, he always stands in for everything I say I'm doing to take control of the message in the narrative.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  And then he self discredits.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  That's his job now on the liberal media.
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  So, you know, we're on target when they bring him out of the bullpen when, when that creature rises up out of hell.
[38:21.000 --> 38:31.000]  When, when Judas Iscariot on PCP, when, when Benedict Arnold on steroids rises from the pit of hell, you know, you're on the right target.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  We're talking to Roger Stone here.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  Just a moment.
[38:35.000 --> 38:35.000]  It's been four years.
[38:36.000 --> 38:39.000]  We've had the deep earth crystal best iodine out there, the good halogen that it's helped cleanse my body.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  3,000 plus reviews on power reviews.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  Nobody's got that 4.8 stars.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  We're running out of it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  And because it's from deeper sources and the gas companies that drill for it, it's a derivative.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  They're not drilling for what they do.
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  They're saying a lot more money or they're running out all this other stuff.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  And so we're selling out of our latest shipment today.
[38:59.000 --> 39:03.000]  And then we're going to hopefully have enough for four or five more runs.
[39:04.000 --> 39:05.000]  And then that may be it.
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  I've put it back to full retail, something we've never even had it full retail.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  But for everybody that's on the newsletter in full wars.com, Ford slash newsletter, you get exclusive articles, videos, you name it.
[39:16.000 --> 39:26.000]  Because you're there, I'm going to be 50% off retail, which is $20 less than it was already discounted yesterday at like $21 or $20 any nice sense.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  And that was 30% off already discounted.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  So it's $40 right now, $39.95.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  At infowarfstore.com, if you want to support the broadcast and help us fund the operation, great.

[39:43.000 --> 39:44.000]  50% off mass murderers agree.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  Gun control works with a picture of Hitler, Stalin and Mao on it.
[39:49.000 --> 39:55.000]  The first T shirt I ever designed info wars.com on the back.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  And politicians love disarmed peasants on the back.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  It's a great classic anti gun control shirt.
[40:02.000 --> 40:03.000]  It's 50% off.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  It is the V that that shirts been out 20 years.
[40:07.000 --> 40:08.000]  That shirt helped fund our original operations.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  One of my film America destroyed by design.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  Those are the first things I put out to fund this operation.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  America destroyed by design and that shirt, we also have the Bill Clinton rape shirt and others.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  It's all about the First Amendment and we have a new shirt we're launching today.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  I'll tell you about later.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.000]  So that's all there.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  We have the new bubblegum flavor with the tea tree oil, with the iodine, with the colloidal silver.
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  We have it all, but it's in bubblegum flavor and it doesn't have the peppermint that's so strong in it.
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  The adult has sold out of super blue.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  We are calling it super blue.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  We are changing the name to super pink.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  The other turns of blue just got iodine.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  I guess this does turn blue, grayish blue.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  The point is, is it's bubblegum flavor so your kids love it.
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  This is so much better than most children's toothpaste.
[40:50.000 --> 40:51.000]  Get it today, 995.
[40:52.000 --> 40:53.000]  It's concentrated.

[40:58.000 --> 41:03.000]  Now, told you about Lord Christopher Monkton, Mike Cernovich, the big rock star right now with that leak.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.000]  The real rock star is folks that leaked it to him joining us.
[41:05.000 --> 41:11.000]  Millie Weaver on the ground in LA, David Knight, the Sawman and so much more.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  We've got World War III Nightmare Scenario brewing in the East China Sea.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  Oh, that CNBC finally realizes how much danger we're in.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  They might get off the president's back.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  We've got so much to cover today, but joining us from the Stone Cold Truth.
[41:26.000 --> 41:29.000]  Joining us is Roger Stone, again, former head of the Trump campaign.
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  Also got him to run back in 2000, friend for over 40 years.
[41:32.000 --> 41:37.000]  Here to cover the waterfront with big breaking news on what's really happening inside the White House.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[41:40.000 --> 41:51.000]  Alex, first of all, let me salute my friend, Mike Cernovich, freedom fighter and yet another person that Google is attempting to strangle.
[41:51.000 --> 42:01.000]  Facebook is attempting to strangle by limiting our reach, but he has done his country a notable service and my Pat is rhetorically off to it.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  You're right, Alex, there are so many developments in Washington.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  It's really somewhat hard to keep track.
[42:09.000 --> 42:19.000]  Let's start with the fact that legitimate, totally credible sources tell me that my name is among those that Susan Rice unmasked.
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  That my name is among those where she was searching for the intelligence.
[42:27.000 --> 42:34.000]  This is, of course, using intelligence agency material from surveillance for strictly political purposes.
[42:35.000 --> 42:38.000]  It is also a felony and it just amazes me.
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  It's ultra illegal.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Strictly illegal both at two levels.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  One, the request and, secondarily, the dissemination.
[42:49.000 --> 42:58.000]  There are clearly leaks in the New York Times and in fake news sites such as the smoking gun and raw story.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  These people are guilty of a felony because they are recipients of information, raw information.
[43:05.000 --> 43:16.000]  And by the way, I noticed even Politifact and other groups that are pretty liberal, they put out articles last week saying, OK, Roger Stone never said that he was talking to these people beforehand.
[43:17.000 --> 43:18.000]  He talked to them after publicly.
[43:19.000 --> 43:20.000]  He wrote articles for Breitbart.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  Everything Roger Stone said has come out and Congressman Schiff is lying.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  I couldn't believe that.
[43:26.000 --> 43:35.000]  KABC, perhaps the most powerful drive time station in LA, invited both Congressman Schiff and I yesterday for a face off.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  I don't need to tell you he was a no show.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Of course, he could have called in by phone as I did.
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  I'm still waiting to hear from both the House and the Senate committee, but let me just reiterate.
[43:47.000 --> 43:48.000]  I don't need a subpoena.
[43:48.000 --> 43:56.000]  I'm not asking for immunity and I want to testify to both bodies in public, not behind closed doors.
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  Let's move on to the White House because Alex, you're absolutely right.
[44:01.000 --> 44:07.000]  We now know incredibly that the president has gone to war with the Freedom Caucus.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  This makes little sense to me because the Freedom Caucus is made up of libertarians.
[44:13.000 --> 44:19.000]  It's his backbone. It's the people that brought him. That's right. These are his natural allies.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  And while it is true, you could never completely please them the way some of us libertarians are.
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  You could at least be giving them enough from a policy point of view that they would be your backbone.
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  And then you only have to convince the establishment Republicans to join you much easier than the other way around.
[44:40.000 --> 44:41.000]  Here is the sad truth.
[44:41.000 --> 44:47.000]  President's health care bill was drafted by former Speaker John Boehner and a team of lobbyists.
[44:48.000 --> 44:49.000]  It was passed to Ryan.
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.000]  Ryan passed it to Priebus.
[44:52.000 --> 44:56.000]  Priebus passed it off to the president and did him a disservice.
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.000]  This is not the best bill that could have been presented.
[45:01.000 --> 45:10.000]  If I were the president, I would simply say, well, now that the Ryan bill has failed, I'll introduce my own bill.
[45:11.000 --> 45:16.000]  Now, Alex, please understand any time I criticize the president or his administration,
[45:17.000 --> 45:23.000]  it's out of loyalty to the president and my sincere desire that he succeed in his effort to throw off.
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  Absolutely. And it's a no brainer that he's getting.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  It's a no brainer that he's getting bad advice to to.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  He could disagree with the freedom caucus and try to get a bill that's better than Obamacare passed.
[45:34.000 --> 45:39.000]  I understand that, but he can't sit there and say they're the enemy and stuff and watch the Democrats celebrate.
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  I think he figured that out by this weekend meeting with Senator Paul, Paul hinted at this a few weeks ago when he was on,
[45:46.000 --> 45:52.000]  but also there's some other channels that Trump just wants it to be on Congress and wants to get it repealed period,
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  but that he now is looking to actually work with Paul to try to craft something.
[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  So that's the word. Meanwhile, again, Rand Paul says very optimistic about repealing Obamacare after golfing with Trump.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  What do you make of that?
[46:04.000 --> 46:11.000]  You got there before I did. I was delighted to hear that those who were advocating that the president meet with Senator Paul,
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  vary the hatchet and work together and that that has happened.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  There was, of course, resistance to that among some on the White House staff.
[46:21.000 --> 46:29.000]  Then you had this bombshell story yesterday of the deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, leaving the administration.
[46:30.000 --> 46:38.000]  After her financial disclosure forms showed that she was paid $300,000 from the Republican National Committee
[46:39.000 --> 46:44.000]  on top of her salary of $300,000. That's $600,000.
[46:44.000 --> 46:51.000]  But the $300,000 was paid to her through a dummy company controlled by her mother.
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.000]  This is the kind of person that was promoted for the White House staff,
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.000]  came over from the Republican National Committee, has now been discharged.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  It's vitally important that the president surround himself with loyalists.
[47:07.000 --> 47:12.000]  People like Ed Martin, people like David Urban, people like Wayne Berman.
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  These are people who played an important role in his election.
[47:17.000 --> 47:20.000]  They don't need government jobs. They don't seek government jobs.
[47:21.000 --> 47:22.000]  They want to restore the republic.
[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  But they would join the administration if they were asked.
[47:26.000 --> 47:31.000]  And I just use them as examples of people with enormous qualifications and experience,
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  but who are deeply committed to the Trump agenda.
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.000]  Absolutely. But let's just move back to some of the bigger issues here.
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  And obviously that's a huge issue, but Trump just has to make the decision
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  to kick out more of these establishment Republicans and realize
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.000]  he can't make them do his will to restore the republic.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  They're going to backstab them at every turn.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  I think 74 days in, he finally started to get that.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  But going back here, what about the intel I'm getting?
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  And I talked to you last night, you can confirm some of this,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  but you can't get into some of it because obviously it's conversations with the president and others.
[48:01.000 --> 48:09.000]  But looking at this, Nunez had to actually even be told about some of the things that were going on
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  by only a few patriots that were even in the White House,
[48:13.000 --> 48:14.000]  because Nunez didn't even know where to look.
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  And so that just shows that Trump is just surrounded by a bunch of either ignoramuses
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  or people that are out to sabotaging because, I mean, in 10 minutes,
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  I can give Trump advice if he executed it,
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  that the American people would be screaming for the heads of all these Democrats, okay?
[48:31.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's simple.
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.000]  And I mean, we have them, we have them, we have them.
[48:34.000 --> 48:35.000]  If he simply pulls the trigger, go ahead.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  Well, Alex, since we spoke last night, I've actually learned more.
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.000]  The reason that two junior aides in the White House took this bombshell evidence to Chairman Nunez
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  is because they knew Chairman Nunez could not be blocked from communicating it to the president.
[48:50.000 --> 48:56.000]  They did so because they did not think if they passed it up, a chain of command to some of the established Republicans
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  at the top of the White House food chain that the information, vital information, would get to the president.
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  This is why they gave it to Chairman Nunez.
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  None of this makes the information less accurate nor less true.
[49:11.000 --> 49:19.000]  So it gives you the idea of the kind of treachery that we see among some in the Trump White House.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  Here's another piece of news, Alex, and I think this is key.
[49:25.000 --> 49:35.000]  There is no question now that sources tell me that the president's son-in-law enjoys a very lively text exchange with Joe Scarborough.
[49:35.000 --> 49:43.000]  And the Scarborough's repeated attacks on Steve Bennett, not to mention some of his attacks on the president,
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  clearly are being manipulated by Jared Kushner for his own internal purposes.
[49:51.000 --> 49:58.000]  Now, again, any criticism that I have of Trump administration or any member thereof, and Mr. Kushner is one,
[49:58.000 --> 50:07.000]  are meant to be constructive, not destruct. But in this case, Joe Scarborough is no friend of the president.
[50:08.000 --> 50:17.000]  He revels in passing fake news. He himself has more scandals than you can shake a stick at that he is sitting on.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  By the way, let me stop you. Is this in the news or is this from your sources?
[50:20.000 --> 50:28.000]  What the hell is Jared Kushner doing talking to a guy that's, you know, has a dead intern in his office and is an absolute scumbag?
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  Well, I didn't say those things you did, but this has not hit the news. This is breaking right now on info wars.
[50:36.000 --> 50:41.000]  And that is the back channel between the president's son-in-law and Joe Scarborough.
[50:42.000 --> 50:45.000]  Hold on. Let's talk about this more when we come back, because I don't want to run Jared down.
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  He looks like a smart guy, good-looking guy. Clearly, it's grooming him to be president. Great.
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.000]  But not if he's not smart enough to sit there and play patty cake with the likes of Joe Scarborough, some of the lowest trash on Earth.
[50:57.000 --> 50:58.000]  We'll be back. Stay with us.
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  They say you can't take on the man and win, that one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  But they don't know Harry's. How's Harry's done it?
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  Simple. By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.000]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online. They ship directly from their site to you and do it for a lot less.

[51:59.000 --> 52:05.000]  It's called the Deep State. Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[52:06.000 --> 52:09.000]  Deep State was first revealed in the Runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[54:55.000 --> 55:04.000]  Jared Kushner there in the White House, the son-in-law of President Trump, who is at the center basically of everything now,
[55:05.000 --> 55:14.000]  and his communications with Joe Scarborough, a Democratic Party operative conservative turncoat basically in my view.
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.000]  But here is those bombshell developments. Roger tells me it is just sensational. Please continue.
[55:20.000 --> 55:29.000]  Alex, first of all, let me say that any time I level a criticism at the Trump administration or even rarely at the president himself,
[55:30.000 --> 55:38.000]  I do so out of loyalty to Donald Trump and loyalty to his agenda. I want to help him beat back the globalists and make this country great again.
[55:38.000 --> 55:49.000]  That said, my political experience with Ronald Reagan and before that Richard Nixon tells me that a White House divided against itself cannot stand.
[55:50.000 --> 56:00.000]  And the internal squabbling between the establishment wing and the diminished true believers continues inside the White House.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  Yes, the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, perhaps the one presidential aide who cannot be fired,
[56:08.000 --> 56:14.000]  is now in irregular text message communications with Joe Scarborough.
[56:15.000 --> 56:25.000]  Many of the anti-Steve Bannon stories that you see, the themes that you see on Morning Joe are being dictated by Kushner.
[56:25.000 --> 56:35.000]  And while Mr. Kushner's plate is very full with Middle Eastern peace and the China visit and so on,
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  in this case, I think he is discerving the president.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Scarborough himself is a badly flawed carrier for this message.
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.000]  He is bitter with jealousy since he wanted to run for president.
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  He nurses ideas of coming back to Florida and running for governor.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  I'd have to jump into the Republican primary to stop him if he really tried that,
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.000]  although there are certainly much, much better candidates than Joe Scarborough or Roger Stone.
[57:08.000 --> 57:13.000]  So there you have it and more of this story as it develops.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  This is just incredible.
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  So Joe Scarborough, and I know your sources are impeccable.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  You've never given me a story that didn't turn out to be true.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  Roger is the main leaker against Bannon.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  I know you can't get into sources, but you were telling me off there.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  This is very extensive.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  You want to talk about it over the phone that this is really confirmed and then it's really, really bad.
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.000]  Were you speaking during the break because we didn't have time to get to it on what Kushner's doing or what Scarborough's doing?
[57:41.000 --> 57:46.000]  Well, Kushner is clearly feeding the lines and the intel to Scarborough.
[57:46.000 --> 57:55.000]  And then Scarborough is visiting those on Kushner's internal rivals or those who are arguing against the globalist agenda.
[57:56.000 --> 58:04.000]  If you go back to some of our earlier discussions here at Info Wars, I've said repeatedly that my greatest concern was not liberal Democrats,
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.000]  but establishment Republicans who would undo the Trump revolution.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Stay right there. We got to go to break. We'll do five more minutes, but Roger Stone, let me ask you this.
[58:12.000 --> 58:19.000]  Do we think it's Kushner, because we thought it was Priebus from our sources that's going around telling the press that the president was like a lost child?
[58:20.000 --> 58:30.000]  I think that is people below Priebus, but people that Priebus has selected because that is not in either Kushner's or Priebus's interest.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  And they're not, these are not stupid.
[58:33.000 --> 58:39.000]  And the question is what the hell if Kushner's not dumb is he doing shit in there, pin-palling with that piece of garbage, Scarborough.
[58:39.000 --> 58:44.000]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, get his book today.
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  I don't care where you get it, get it.
[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[58:55.000 --> 59:00.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[59:01.000 --> 59:05.000]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system,
[59:05.000 --> 59:13.000]  but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:14.000 --> 59:20.000]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[59:21.000 --> 59:21.000]  These are all parasites.
[59:22.000 --> 59:23.000]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:31.000 --> 59:34.000]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  It just came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[59:41.000 --> 59:44.000]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:46.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  So there's a total mutiny against the president.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  On another note, we were just talking about how he's getting audited and harassed by the IRS.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  You know, we constantly do.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  And then Trump can't even fire the guy at the IRS that got caught doing all this horrible stuff
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  because the whole bureaucracy is just ignoring Trump.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  It's a total mutiny.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  So what does he do?
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  Well, first, he gets a clean team.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  I don't know what his daughter's going to do to him because he throws Jared out.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  I know that he likes Jared, their friends.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  I think Jared's really taking advantage of that.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Sometimes family does that when they're involved in an operation.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  That's just the way it goes.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  But Roger, you were saying there's a lot.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  What is specifically going on here?
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  Well, I don't question Jared Kushner's loyalty to the president, but I do question his vision.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Alex, he's a liberal Democrat from a very prominent family of liberal Democrats in New Jersey.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  I don't think he understands the Trump coalition.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Well, does he understand family and he wants to be in that administration?
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  He'll do what the president wants, that he's not the president.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Does he understand that?
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Well, I think at this point he probably believes he is giving the president good advice when in fact he's giving him bad advice.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt on motive.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  But Alex, he doesn't understand the Info Wars watcher.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  He doesn't understand the Breitbart reader.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  We are the backbone of the Trump Revolution.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  We are the soldiers who won this election.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  And we do not want to see the revolution hijacked by a bunch of establishment Republican geeks.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  He has to get that through his head.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  What else is in these texts?
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  I mean, you can't tell us how you learned other little tidbits of that, Roger.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  This is a big story.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Well, I think if you go back and watch Morning Joe now, retrospectively, the last several weeks,
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  you will see a coordinated attack on our colleague and our fellow patriot, Steve Bannon.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  The other question that's looming here, Alex, is the way that the Silicon Valley billionaires are whining and dining
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Jared Kushner and his wife, who's a good friend of mine and a great lady, Ivanka Trump.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Meanwhile, Google, Facebook, they're slowly squeezing our throats, you, me, Sernovich, Breitbart,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  and other alternative media sources to see them fooling with our logarithms.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  We're the main guns that are defending Trump and saving him at every front while people in his White House
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  are whining and dining the people that are strangling the Republic right now and trying to destroy him
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  and pushing down his tweets and manipulating him.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Well, and if anybody in the world should understand this, of course, it's Steve Bannon,
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  who comes from the world of alternative media.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  We've got a slowdown going on here that I think is only going to be solved with antitrust action against Google
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  and some other tactics that we are working on.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  But I have no intention of going quietly and watching them cut off our access
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Sure. Even US News and World Report admits Google is the top censor in the world.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Microsoft, they're all doing it and they admit they're doing it to us.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  And David Brock, literally, who brags he got you banned off TV, the MVP, Roger Stone,
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  not because you were full of bull because you were effective, they're bragging that they're openly working with Google
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  to shut us down. Talk about torches interference.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  I just don't have the time or energy for lawsuits, but my lawyers tell me I've got them.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Well, I have examined that in all honesty. Brock has to say something because he pocketed 30 or 40 million dollars
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  from rich, dumb, liberal donors.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  And despite their enormous spending advantage and the fact that they were manipulating internet media
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  and manipulating mainstream media, they lost.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  And that's hard to explain to somebody who's giving you 30 million dollars.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  So this is Brock's new big claim.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  There's no question that you have left the organizations like Snopes now deciding what is and is not news.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  This is a slippery slope.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  And then they bury them.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Yeah, they're Judge Jury and Executioner, Judge Dredd, the lady with her cat.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. Let's talk again sometime this evening.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Roger Stone is a fast and furious town to be alive.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Everyone should be part of the revolution and spread your links, our links, infowars.com, stonecultruth.com,
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  we're winning, but the enemy is attacking. This is when the battle's got to be pressed.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  The attack has got to be pushed to its maximum ramming speed.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  Spread those links to the forewinds continually and we will defeat the globalist.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  And spread the word about our local affiliates. Thank you, Roger Stone. Big guest coming up.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Blackwater found secret Seychelles meeting to establish Trump Putin back channel.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  That's right, Trump Putin back channel could be found in thousands of articles all released within two hours of each other.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  And they claim that Eric Prince of Blackwater was having secret meetings at an Indian Ocean Island with Russia to set up a secret back channel with Putin.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  The proof we do have are the NSA request logs with Susan Rice's name all over them which is asking for the unmasking of Donald Trump and his associates.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  So she, Obama and others could spy on them.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  Rob Dew reporting for infowars.com and infowars nightly news.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with good halogen iodine, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  The reason info wars life has five star ratings on major third party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  I take this, my family takes this and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously the super female is amazing. I love it.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  It's got a five star rating. It's a win win infowarslife.com.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Go to infowarslife.com.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Alex Jones. He was a nice guy actually. You like him?
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  That's good. Alex was a nice guy.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  I know now from top people that you actually are for real and you understand you're in danger and you understand what you're doing.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot, but you'll be looking at me in a year or two years. Let's give me a little bit of time to run things.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  But a year into office, you'll be saying, wow, I remember that interview. He said he was going to do it and he did a great job.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  You'll be very proud of our country.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  So while we're there, you probably read it. It was in Drudge. Who's great, by the way. Drudge is amazing.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  But the story in Drudge and Big Store, it's all over the place now.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  They're swimming across and big bags of stuff, shrugs swimming across the river.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Swimming right across.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  We just caught these guys coming across the border. They're jumping in. They just jumped in the rafts.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  They're coming up one, two, three, four. They have big satchels.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And actually the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Because they're showing this on camera. The guys carrying bags of stuff, it was shrugs.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Thank you.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  Donald Trump, I hope you can help Uncripple America. Thank you so much, sir.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  You will be attacked for coming on and we know you know that. Thank you.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Thank you very much.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  Last week when Jean-Claude Junkers of the most powerful Nazi supporting family, Prussian royalty.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  That's the German military state, form of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire military state.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  The main aircraft producer for the Nazis in World War II, so war profiteer criminals, they captured Luxembourg during the war and never gave it up.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  You wonder where the Nazi money went.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  I mean, there's books written about the Junkers. I call them Junkers as an insult.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  And this creature came out and said to Donald Trump, we will break your country up.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  We will economically wage war and you just like they did with Brexit.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  You notice the UK said, oh, you already dropped bombs on us in 1941 or whatever, that didn't work.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  We're certainly not worried about you trying to crash our economy.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  But the arrogance and then after he, I was trying to get more bonks on last week.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Since then, this is just breaking today, we have Spanish members of parliament, EU members of parliament.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I have a stack of news here threatening war with the UK.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  This is insane.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  Now you have the Prime Minister saying, well, they try to take the rocket Gibraltar that's been British control for hundreds of years, you know, controlling the interests of the Mediterranean.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  We'll go to war just like the Falkland War.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  So now we have a Spanish gunship entering British waters off Gibraltar.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  This is unprecedented.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  So what is going on?
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Former top advisor to Margaret Thatcher, kind of the prototype guy helping, you know, found UK.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  It's now spread all over Europe.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  The chief scientist out there exposing all the climate change fraud.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Of course, we have the lowest hurricane level ever recorded now this year.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  They just announced we're not going to get into all that science and public policy.org.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  What's up with that.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Com Lord Christopher Monkton, I won't go over all of that.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  And the media goes, don't call him a Lord.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  They disbanded the House of Lords.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  That's his dad.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  That's him.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  He's a patriot.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  It's fun to say, you know, I love how they play these semantical games.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  So here we are, ladies and gentlemen with Lord Christopher Monkton, a super patriot.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  We see nationalism rising, globalism panicking.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  What are they going to do?
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  That's my second question.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  What does he make of what's happening currently in the world?
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  The left alliance with radical Islam, just the state of the world with Lord Monkton.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And what's happening with all these EU bureaucrats, unelected dictators, threatening economic war, physical war, EU armies, threatening to march them in.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  I mean, I guess we didn't take that serious in 1939 either.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  What is going on?
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  It's going to not see air.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Is he threatening us?
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  Everything that the appalling John Claude Juncker has said merely reinforces the reasons why it was so necessary for us in the United Kingdom to have nothing further to do with the dictatorial fascistic communist European Union, the tyranny by clerk, because that's what they really are.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  These people whose ambition vastly exceeds their competence have responded in a petulant, childish and arrogant way to what was on any view a thoughtful, considered and very friendly six page letter from our Prime Minister, Theresa May, notifying them on March the 29th,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  that Britain would be in two years time on March the 29th, 2019, quitting the European Union.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Now, Theresa May deliberately went to great lengths to say how much Britain feels that it is part of Europe, because we have no quarrel with Europe.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Our quarrel is with the dictators of the European Union, and the reason why we don't like the European Union is that the European Union is anti-European because it is anti-democratic.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  It was Europe that gave the world the name and the reality of democracy.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  It was the ancient Greeks who did that.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And it is Europe now in the shape of the European Union that reject democracy.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  And when this very civilized letter, on any view, a very civilized letter was sent by Theresa May, great thought had gone into it, a very responsible, very statesman like letter.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  What has happened since is enormous petulance on the part of the EU, and some bureaucrats thought they'd have some fun saying that if anything in the negotiations affected Gibraltar, the Government of Spain would have to be asked.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  Well, now here is how the law actually works.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  By the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Spain agreed that Gibraltar was British.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  That is the law. That is the international treaty. It hasn't been revoked. It hasn't been repealed.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  We are both bound by that just as much now as we were in 1713 when both parties signed it.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  So let us have no more nonsense from the EU bureaucrats about grabbing Gibraltar.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  And of course, quite rightly, several Conservative members of parliament have got on their high horses and they've said, if the EU is going to threaten Gibraltar, we will take whatever steps military or other to defend the people of Gibraltar.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  As recently as 2004, that was the most recent of many occasions on which the people of Gibraltar have been asked by referendum, do they even want Spain to have a slightly increased share in the Government of Gibraltar?
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  And the answer was 99.7%. No, they want to remain entirely, completely and splendidly British.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  So there's going to be no more nonsense about Gibraltar. We're not having that.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  What it does indicate is bad faith on the part of those in the European Union who, on the one hand, insist that we should comply with the letter as well as the spirit of the European treaties while at the same time saying that they feel that they and Spain can get together for the sake of spiting and harming Gibraltar and spiting Britain,
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  ignoring the Treaty of Utrecht, which is just as much a treaty and just as much binding and just as much current as the European treaties are.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  So that's that one. Let's have no more nonsense.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Well, let me correct you. Under law, Lord Monkton, international law, common law, European law, British law, isn't the fact that it's almost 300 years old, make it even stronger by right of possession?
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  Well, of course, it isn't right of possession.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  Well, it's right of treaty and right of exercise and right of everything. I'm saying...
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  That's right. I mean, you could say by long custom and practice, which is one of the...
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  That's the right term. Long custom and practice. That's what I was looking for.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Absolutely. And of course, they would argue, on the other hand, just as Argentina tried to do with the Falklands, that territorial contiguity gives them some rights.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  In other words, their territory is closer to such a broader than British territory is. Well, that's not how it works, not in the post-colonial era.
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  You see, Spain and Argentina are still living in the colonial era, where you can go around and help yourself to prop...
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  So is Junker, isn't he? So is Junker.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  That's what they're trying to do. But you see, in the post-colonial era, what determines sovereignty above all else, above even treaties, is what's called the right of self-determination.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  Isn't that 1776? That's America.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  Well, that's exactly what you did, whether we liked it or not, in 1776.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  And as you know, Alex, I have a standing offer on behalf of Her Majesty's government, and I'm happy to convey it to you now, that if only you will in future remember to put your tea in the teapot rather than in the harbour, because it tastes better that way.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  We will remit all the taxes and imposts upon you, save only the original tax of half a crown of pound on tea.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  And I think you'll find that a great bargain for the restoration of British government will be far cheaper, certainly than the Obama administration was.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  Probably a lot better, yeah.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  So, you know, do feel free to return to the British crown at any time you like. You will be welcomed with open arms.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  But more seriously, one of the things that I'm doing in June on the 23rd and the 24th in Bozeman, Montana, is we're going to hold a thing called the Red Pill Expo.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  And you can go to redpillexpo.org and make your booking to come to that conference, where we're going to be discussing all these issues that Brexit and, of course, all the problems that Mr. Trump faces with unwilling bureaucrats and the Democrats rioting in the streets and so forth.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  We're going to be discussing all that at the Red Pill Expo.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  And if you go to redpillexpo.org, you can make your booking there.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  And I'd love to see you there, Alex.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  I know I've been invited. I would love to. I'm launching a bunch of projects.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  But soon I'm going to come to some of the conferences here at Lord Monty, because I want to see you again in person as we've done.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  Now, we're going to come back in the next segment, but we've got 30 seconds here, 40 seconds.
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  How is the new older doing right now? I mean, they say they're falling apart. Is that true?
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  There's no doubt that the people who think that nation states still have a future are in the ascendant at the moment.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  We won Brexit and now we are going to leave the European Union, whatever the result of the negotiations.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  Mr. Trump, splendidly whom I campaigned for in Montana during the election campaign.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  I'm thrilled that he's now the president of the United States.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  He's already unwound, all the climate rubbish.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  He's gradually pushing back on that and many other so-called globalist agendas.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  And, of course, they're not really globalists.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  Let's talk about the state of the fight for sovereignty.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  And we'll talk about the French election and so much more in one more segment with Lord Montyne of ScienceandPublicPolicy.org.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  We've got a bunch of other guests joining us with huge breaking news today as well.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  The revolution against globalist tyranny is exploding.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:20:18.000]  Be part of it today, share these links, share these videos because the censorship is unparalleled.
