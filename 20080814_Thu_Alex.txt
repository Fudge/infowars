[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:44.960]  Texas Alex Jones the Georgian conflict is not subsiding in fact it is
[00:44.960 --> 00:54.480]  escalating it is such a uncommon thing to see two superpowers squaring off for
[00:54.480 --> 00:59.480]  an expansion of a conflict to the point that it's almost hit a blind spot with
[00:59.480 --> 01:05.440]  myself in the last two days hearing that Georgia the conflict there was
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.680]  cooling down a bit the Russians were pulling back really made me happy and
[01:10.680 --> 01:14.780]  I hope for the best but then I actually started watching the geopolitical
[01:14.780 --> 01:18.680]  developments and there are scores of them that are earth shaking
[01:18.680 --> 01:25.760]  individually taken together it is a cacophony of danger signs so we're
[01:25.760 --> 01:30.160]  gonna be covering that first today then we have two important guests coming up
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.520]  later on the show Barbara Lofisher National Vaccine Information Center
[01:34.520 --> 01:39.000]  more is coming out now about the devastation that the miscarriages of
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.840]  women taking the HPV human papilloma live cancer virus vaccine all of the
[01:45.840 --> 01:52.620]  deaths the close to 10,000 admitted adverse reactions autoimmune diseases
[01:52.620 --> 01:57.980]  people being paralyzed close to 10,000 remember with an old drug you get about
[01:57.980 --> 02:02.340]  one out of ten adverse reactions reported these are official rule of
[02:02.340 --> 02:06.700]  thumbs used by the CDC and doctors asking doctor they can tell you with a
[02:06.700 --> 02:12.260]  well-known drug one out of ten adverse reactions get reported about one out of
[02:12.260 --> 02:17.500]  40 get reported with a new drug so you got 9,000 plus and we're talking one out
[02:17.500 --> 02:25.020]  of 40 this is a pandemic of injury but it was meant to do that it's a test of a
[02:25.020 --> 02:29.140]  bio weapon said that a year ago to see if they can introduce a bio weapon to the
[02:29.140 --> 02:33.520]  public use PR and hype to cover it up and sell the population on it so we'll
[02:33.520 --> 02:36.740]  talk to her about that coming up two hours then Luke Radowski and Corey Roe
[02:36.740 --> 02:43.420]  will be with us in the fourth hour I am so busy here on the home front in

[08:18.100 --> 08:23.100]  let me give you my basic synopsis of what's happening in the widening
[08:23.100 --> 08:29.780]  confrontation with Russia by the United States of NATO and Israel then I'll
[08:29.780 --> 08:38.700]  break down the facts of the matter and go through some important clips it's clear
[08:38.700 --> 08:45.660]  now why this was done they wanted to gauge Russian response last Thursday we
[08:45.660 --> 08:51.620]  are now about seven eight days into the attack a sneak attack was launched by
[08:51.620 --> 08:56.860]  Georgian forces backed up by mercenaries NATO Israelis and US forces
[08:56.860 --> 09:02.140]  Marines and army a massive unprecedented sneak attack against civilian
[09:02.140 --> 09:07.940]  populations murdering in the thousands in one city alone and the total death toll
[09:07.940 --> 09:13.580]  again is rising close to four thousand as you put all the reports together the
[09:13.580 --> 09:18.980]  Russians poured in repulse the attack drove the invading Georgian armies out
[09:18.980 --> 09:27.980]  of Ossetia and Abkhazia the Russians then destroyed the are partially
[09:27.980 --> 09:34.820]  destroyed the armies and equipment massing in the surrounding territory
[09:34.820 --> 09:38.980]  around Ossetia they then went in and occupied some of the military bases
[09:38.980 --> 09:44.380]  and destroyed them standard procedure if the same thing had happened the US you
[09:44.380 --> 09:48.140]  can be assured Georgia would be completely occupied and the population
[09:48.140 --> 09:52.020]  would basically be exterminated like the Iraqis a million two hundred thousand
[09:52.020 --> 09:56.940]  that are now dead the Russians didn't do that they started pulling back two days
[09:56.940 --> 10:01.820]  ago on Tuesday afternoon the Georgians continued using special operations no
[10:01.820 --> 10:06.180]  doubt US forces to take potshots at them so that they could scream bloody murder
[10:06.180 --> 10:09.860]  and say oh look the Russians didn't do a ceasefire they're still shooting at us
[10:09.860 --> 10:14.020]  but it's been confirmed and it's all on info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[10:14.020 --> 10:19.940]  from multiple Russian European and US sources it's all buried in the news it's
[10:19.940 --> 10:24.100]  the headlines that lie in the US and continuing attacks on them
[10:24.100 --> 10:29.140]  Georgian ships Monday Tuesday and Wednesday have been trying to attack
[10:29.140 --> 10:34.300]  Russian ships with torpedoes the Russians then were forced to destroy some
[10:34.300 --> 10:39.660]  small patrol boats and then move in and destroy some ships in the harbors that
[10:39.660 --> 10:43.660]  is misrepresented as Russian further aggression and attacks they have been
[10:43.660 --> 10:51.420]  extremely restrained I've you study the art of warfare and basically airpower
[10:51.420 --> 10:56.980]  and infantry maneuvers what a nation should do is a Russia should go in to
[10:56.980 --> 11:02.140]  pose the government and then put in a puppet that's normally what's done and
[11:02.140 --> 11:06.260]  then pull back out because obviously they don't want to be sucked in for the
[11:06.260 --> 11:12.700]  sectarian warfare between Russians and the Georgians and Muslims of three
[11:12.700 --> 11:17.860]  major factions that all continually fight with each other in Georgia formally
[11:17.860 --> 11:24.380]  part of southern Russia the Russians are blockading and stopping arms from
[11:24.380 --> 11:30.940]  coming in out from Ukrainian supply ships the Russians have their only port
[11:30.940 --> 11:34.380]  in the black sea on the black sea in Ukraine
[11:34.380 --> 11:43.340]  Ukraine's president which is a globalist puppet has been rattling sabers
[11:43.340 --> 11:48.060]  saying he's US troops in quote prepare for a Russian attack on Ukraine that's
[11:48.060 --> 11:51.540]  what the public's being sold in truth more US troops are massing in Ukraine
[11:51.540 --> 11:54.860]  weapon systems are being brought in the Ukrainians are trying to supply the
[11:54.860 --> 12:01.020]  Georgians hundreds of US flights of arms for the last four days have been
[12:01.020 --> 12:07.340]  flying in to Tbilisi and other major cities of Georgia with arms and 2000
[12:07.340 --> 12:11.380]  Georgian troops that have been brought out of Iraq which is a serious act of
[12:11.380 --> 12:15.740]  war and now they're telling the Russians they have to capitulate and hand
[12:15.740 --> 12:21.820]  Ossetia have Kasia over to United Nations slash NATO troops that helped
[12:21.820 --> 12:26.700]  launch the sneak attack or Russia will have sanctions put on it and more US
[12:26.700 --> 12:30.380]  troops brought into the region so they've they've they've punched Russia in the
[12:30.380 --> 12:37.700]  nose knocking out a couple of teeth Russia fought back and then withdrew
[12:37.700 --> 12:43.420]  they're now being encircled and pinprick attacks are being carried out it's
[12:43.420 --> 12:47.940]  being misrepresented in the Western press but again you read in deeper into
[12:47.940 --> 12:50.500]  the articles the facts are all there they just lie on the headline in the
[12:50.500 --> 12:55.540]  first three or four paragraphs and admit the truth later just a huge
[12:55.540 --> 12:59.980]  escalation is what we're witnessing and now we have McCain running around
[12:59.980 --> 13:04.300]  talking about escalation and talking about how in the 21st century nations
[13:04.300 --> 13:09.140]  don't invade other nations when the US is invaded Afghanistan Iraq Serbia
[13:09.140 --> 13:13.220]  handing it over to Muslims in Serbia with Kosovo overthrowing their
[13:13.220 --> 13:16.700]  government I mean unprecedented overthrowing the Serb proper government
[13:16.700 --> 13:27.260]  in Belgrade it is it is it is such lies and hypocrisy and fraud that it
[13:27.260 --> 13:32.460]  staggers the mind we are not by the way defending Russia but to claim that
[13:32.460 --> 13:36.740]  Russia is imperial and to claim that they have imperial aims when they're
[13:36.740 --> 13:41.460]  having their borders carved off when they are being forced to shrink when
[13:41.460 --> 13:45.620]  they are being militarily pressured when the United States is funding guerrilla
[13:45.620 --> 13:51.620]  attacks and now open invasions of cities bordering Russia and that Russia has
[13:51.620 --> 13:57.700]  been so restrained thank God thank God they have been this restrained I mean
[13:57.700 --> 14:02.460]  this has got me really ready to drop everything I'm doing and try to find
[14:02.460 --> 14:05.620]  some property I've been trying to halfway look but I can't afford anything
[14:05.620 --> 14:09.820]  outside Austin because the Californians have not bashing you I don't blame you
[14:09.820 --> 14:14.020]  we've all moved in and driven prices up sky high but I mean I'm seriously trying
[14:14.020 --> 14:17.940]  to find a ranch house or something somewhere so I can get my family maybe
[14:17.940 --> 14:21.580]  even have a move into the countryside and then I'll stay in Austin or it's
[14:21.580 --> 14:24.820]  that or leave the country I mean this is the type of thoughts I'm having because
[14:24.820 --> 14:32.780]  we are moving into a world war three type scenario make no mistake and every
[14:32.780 --> 14:39.100]  major military analyst is saying this is the greatest escalation in the history
[14:39.100 --> 14:45.540]  of the Cold War now and I can go through all these quotes here but I'm sure
[14:45.540 --> 14:48.780]  you've been seeing them and reading them but they're saying that Russia has
[14:48.780 --> 14:54.700]  caused this it is this is this is a endangerment of world peace and
[14:54.700 --> 14:58.180]  endangerment of the planet itself as dr. polka robertson said this could hand
[14:58.180 --> 15:02.700]  the planet over to the rain of the cockroach a thermal nuclear exchange
[15:02.700 --> 15:08.980]  with Russia and then a shootout will start with China Pakistan India France
[15:08.980 --> 15:15.180]  England South Africa all brimming with nukes Israel running around with 400
[15:15.180 --> 15:17.820]  nukes threatening everyone threatening the European Parliament of any
[15:17.820 --> 15:21.700]  reparations one member of the Israeli Knesset threatened to use nukes two
[15:21.700 --> 15:26.460]  years ago and you can't make this stuff up this is a Mexican standoff of nuclear
[15:26.460 --> 15:30.660]  weapons with the United States with a bunch of power tripping loony tunes on
[15:30.660 --> 15:35.780]  complete power trips megalomania gone to seed running around threatening
[15:35.780 --> 15:40.700]  everyone and then meanwhile bush made this incendiary statement one hour ago
[15:40.700 --> 15:46.180]  from the White House here it is we expect Russia to honor its commitment to
[15:46.180 --> 15:50.780]  let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect Russia to ensure
[15:50.780 --> 15:54.860]  that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports
[15:54.860 --> 16:00.300]  roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and
[16:00.300 --> 16:04.900]  for civilian transit we expect Russia to meet its commitment to cease all
[16:04.900 --> 16:09.340]  military activities in Georgia and we expect all Russian forces that entered
[16:09.340 --> 16:13.420]  Georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country so I have made clear Russia's
[16:13.420 --> 16:18.860]  ongoing action raised serious questions about its intentions in Georgia and the
[16:18.860 --> 16:23.700]  region recent years Russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political
[16:23.700 --> 16:28.820]  economic and security structures of the 21st century the United States has
[16:28.820 --> 16:34.420]  supported those efforts now Russia is putting its aspirations at risk by
[16:34.420 --> 16:37.660]  taking actions in Georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of
[16:37.660 --> 16:41.560]  those institutions to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.780]  United States Europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the
[16:45.780 --> 16:55.060]  world Russia Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis I mean what
[16:55.060 --> 17:01.140]  do you say about that statement Russia has violated the United States of Russia
[17:01.140 --> 17:05.740]  has shown itself to be a bad member of the international community Russia needs
[17:05.740 --> 17:12.460]  to make reparations Russia was attacked in a sneak attack last Thursday night
[17:12.460 --> 17:17.700]  into Friday morning thousands were killed military bases were leveled by
[17:17.700 --> 17:28.380]  over a hundred tanks jets self-propelled missile batteries this isn't this is
[17:28.380 --> 17:33.660]  just off the charts and but you have a population in the United States who has
[17:33.660 --> 17:38.460]  no basic grasp of anything much less nationally locally but certainly
[17:38.460 --> 17:42.660]  internationally they have no idea even where Georgia is and the average American
[17:42.660 --> 17:46.660]  is bumbling around thinking Russia is starting a fight just like the globalist
[17:46.660 --> 17:51.740]  attacks Serbia for two years with their Muslim brethren out of Albania the Serbs
[17:51.740 --> 17:55.180]  finally fought back when they were engaging in ethnic cleansing against the
[17:55.180 --> 17:58.580]  Serbs and I'm not saying both sides didn't kill each other the point is who
[17:58.580 --> 18:03.580]  started it first blood baby that's the key here in these situations Hitler
[18:03.580 --> 18:06.760]  invaded Poland Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia Hitler invaded
[18:06.760 --> 18:12.820]  Sudetenland he invaded the Rhineland he invaded Danzig he invaded France he
[18:12.820 --> 18:18.620]  invaded North Africa I mean this would be like Bush coming out and trying to
[18:18.620 --> 18:22.700]  change the history of World War two to say that you know that the United States
[18:22.700 --> 18:29.060]  invaded Germany I just it's such an insult to everyone's intellect but I
[18:29.060 --> 18:33.300]  guess the fact that some of the public are buying it says that it's not an
[18:33.300 --> 18:40.100]  insult they know the public is basically a dead horse just ready to be gobbled
[18:40.100 --> 18:45.940]  play John McCain with the hypocrisy award of the year saying that invasions
[18:45.940 --> 18:49.740]  of countries will not be tolerated in 21st century and that it's outrageous
[18:49.740 --> 18:54.540]  that Russia is doing this I don't think we're gonna reignite the Cold War here
[18:54.540 --> 19:00.180]  with Russia I think this is a very serious situation but I don't see this
[19:00.180 --> 19:07.260]  as a return to nuclear standoffs etc etc I want to have a dialogue with the
[19:07.260 --> 19:13.060]  Russians I want them to get out of Georgian territory as quickly as possible
[19:13.060 --> 19:18.340]  and I am interested in good relations between the United States and Russia but
[19:18.340 --> 19:25.740]  in the 21st century nations don't invade other nations so Bush and Connolly
[19:25.740 --> 19:29.780]  sunrise and McCain and all of them are trying to sound reasonable hey Russia
[19:29.780 --> 19:34.380]  attacked us Russia attacked its neighbor we're trying to be reasonable pull out

[20:24.420 --> 20:29.220]  the year 2000 debt growth collapsed to only 4.5 percent it's bad enough that

[26:23.300 --> 26:27.420]  authorized by the Ukrainian government well the Russians have a lease that has
[26:27.420 --> 26:37.380]  decades left on it and they added and by the way we can extend that from 72

[26:41.460 --> 26:48.100]  again and the port and they're telling the Russians that they have to let them

[27:40.020 --> 27:44.340]  ghost recon one we read you the text from the rundown of the video game but
[27:44.340 --> 27:55.380]  but here is where US forces attack the exact target in Ossetia in 2008 I guess
[27:55.380 --> 27:59.500]  just a lucky guess huh except they say the Russians invade in the game here it
[27:59.500 --> 28:06.220]  is the year is 2008 and the world teeters on the brink of war radical

[29:16.500 --> 29:20.380]  capital shooting people murdering them and they did and they went in and they
[29:20.380 --> 29:25.220]  murdered women and children in their homes that's when the decision was made
[29:25.220 --> 29:31.220]  was back in 2001 publicly to encircle Russia and then the people that played

[38:24.840 --> 38:28.840]  slamming this guy's teeth that they knocked out into the ground and then
[38:28.840 --> 38:34.340]  the kicking the stomping the beating with him begging with blood pouring out of
[38:34.340 --> 38:48.340]  his face and his mouth just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on
[38:48.340 --> 38:58.340]  and the footage just pours in from all over the nation every day
[38:58.340 --> 39:02.340]  and I think about the footage I've seen from 6th Street here in Austin Texas what
[39:02.340 --> 39:13.340]  personally seen this country is turning into a fascist police day and I try to
[39:13.340 --> 39:16.840]  reach out to the police I had the Austin police chief in here yesterday and try to
[39:16.840 --> 39:24.340]  give him a fair shake I got criticized from both sides being too hard on him
[39:24.340 --> 39:30.840]  being too nice to him having him on was bad blah blah blah we just try to
[39:30.840 --> 39:34.340]  surprise you here with interesting thought-provoking guest and he was
[39:34.340 --> 39:38.840]  willing to come in which is unprecedented so we had him here five
[39:38.840 --> 39:41.840]  time later I'll talk about my thoughts on that I'll probably air some of it again
[39:41.840 --> 39:48.840]  this Sunday some clips and comment then Sunday show but the government has given
[39:48.840 --> 39:53.840]  the green light to the police to bully the population to cow us into submission
[39:53.840 --> 40:00.340]  and I'm going into Denver where the feds have been caught already planning to
[40:00.340 --> 40:06.340]  provocateur violent actions they've been caught many times before so don't deny
[40:06.340 --> 40:11.340]  that's a fact I'm going into Denver where they're going to put all the protesters
[40:11.340 --> 40:17.840]  quote in cages and where I have seen scores of videos the last month of them
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.840]  beating the living daylights out of peaceful people on the streets doing
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.340]  nothing in Denver that's why I'm going to Denver because that's the front lines
[40:28.340 --> 40:30.840]  of the fight against the new world order that's where they're going to roll out
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.840]  their sound sound cannons microwave guns that's where they're going to have people
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.840]  on cages that's where the threat is that's where the danger is and I have to
[40:38.840 --> 40:43.840]  go chronicle this as a wartime reporter here in my own country dominated by
[40:43.840 --> 40:50.340]  North Common the military also out of color up we live in a nation that is so
[40:50.340 --> 40:53.840]  criminal at the top that they snuck attack Russia last week and then a lot of
[40:53.840 --> 40:57.840]  the public and misconstrued as Russian aggression now encircling them
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.340]  with Ukraine saber-rattling and undoubtedly about to start conflicts
[41:02.340 --> 41:10.140]  with Russia we live in a nation where the police don't just beat you up and
[41:10.140 --> 41:15.840]  break your shin and knock your teeth out and kill you with rubber bullets but if
[41:15.840 --> 41:20.340]  you're lucky enough to survive they didn't charge you with assaulting them
[41:20.340 --> 41:27.440]  when it's all on video I mean every day there's some type of hate bicycles we
[41:27.440 --> 41:31.240]  see them run tackle beat attack and then charge the person whose head they've
[41:31.240 --> 41:40.140]  split open of the individuals they've given subdermal hematomas and there's
[41:40.140 --> 41:46.640]  there's no defending your crimes and as if assaulting us with deadly weapons
[41:46.640 --> 41:54.640]  isn't enough out of the blue you then charge us to protect yourselves do you
[41:54.640 --> 41:57.940]  think this is a place you want your children to live in police do you think
[41:57.940 --> 42:02.140]  this type of evil is being authorized and that the dark forces that are
[42:02.140 --> 42:07.140]  authorizing this won't hurt you and your family in the days and years to come
[42:07.140 --> 42:12.140]  you think you're immune the same people that give you the authority and the
[42:12.140 --> 42:18.940]  protection and the license to abuse us with no checks and balances are the
[42:18.940 --> 42:22.640]  very same elites and social engineers that are destroying your dollar
[42:22.640 --> 42:28.340]  destroying your future destroying your family you think you're immune from an
[42:28.340 --> 42:35.340]  elite that knowingly knew that HPV live cancer virus vaccine was killing people
[42:35.340 --> 42:39.740]  in the trials in mass and that they would push that and have hundreds of
[42:39.740 --> 42:44.540]  thousands of women and children take it as they die and are maimed and that and
[42:44.540 --> 42:50.140]  that that horror won't somehow reach out and touch you and your life you're not
[42:50.140 --> 42:54.940]  horrified by what's going on you rationalize what you're part of and what
[42:54.940 --> 43:03.580]  you're doing at the end of my interview with Boston Chief of Police Art Acevedo
[43:03.580 --> 43:09.820]  yesterday I played about a four-minute clip so I could say bye to him and he
[43:09.820 --> 43:16.140]  got me by the arm tightly grabbed me by the elbow and said very authoritatively
[43:16.140 --> 43:22.740]  you don't really believe all of this do you he said I want you to come right
[43:22.740 --> 43:27.340]  along with me I want you to come see I want you to know he said I know you
[43:27.340 --> 43:34.140]  don't really believe all the things you say gotta watch that guy
[43:34.140 --> 43:45.140]  charming intelligent slick and then I said no I don't believe I know sir and
[43:45.140 --> 43:51.340]  all my staff are in this office oh yes when I first got a job here I try to
[43:51.340 --> 43:54.700]  pick people that aren't in the movement we found that's the best way stops
[43:54.700 --> 43:59.460]  infiltration we didn't believe it Trey was saying I didn't believe all of this
[43:59.460 --> 44:01.980]  when Alex first came to work you know we're doing a syndicated show a year
[44:01.980 --> 44:05.580]  and a half ago but I found out it's all true and worse we can't cover everything
[44:05.580 --> 44:13.180]  we know and he just shook his head and said okay well I'll see you later hey
[44:13.180 --> 44:18.500]  I'm sorry Art Acevedo that you can't come to grips with just how serious it is
[44:18.500 --> 44:23.780]  and I don't blame you it's hard to come to grips with the fact that they're
[44:23.780 --> 44:26.860]  carrying out biological attacks against the American people and we have all the
[44:26.860 --> 44:30.260]  declassified documents they created AIDS you know I had him in here he was saying
[44:30.260 --> 44:33.140]  oh the government's not bad oh it does some things that are wrong but you know
[44:33.140 --> 44:36.140]  it's not evil and I said oh really Tuskegee experiment all these other
[44:36.140 --> 44:39.580]  tests chemical biologically you say yeah yeah I know about that yeah you know
[44:39.580 --> 44:43.820]  about that do you really know do you know you could read for the rest of your
[44:43.820 --> 44:47.140]  life and go to the National Archives for the rest of your life and the testing
[44:47.140 --> 44:50.620]  the chemical biological radiological testing there are so many hundreds of
[44:50.620 --> 44:54.540]  thousands of pages and videos and government admissions of the things
[44:54.540 --> 44:58.660]  they did that you could never one person could never know at all it's going on
[44:58.660 --> 45:04.940]  on such a wide scale I don't even know I've only stuck my toe in a bottomless
[45:04.940 --> 45:11.700]  ocean of that let me tell you something Art Acevedo don't give your kids
[45:11.700 --> 45:16.940]  vaccines buddy because they are putting cancer viruses in them they are putting
[45:16.940 --> 45:21.220]  mercury in them it is hurting you let me tell you every other cop listening in
[45:21.220 --> 45:27.580]  America I know what I talk about I know the information I cover here and I've
[45:27.580 --> 45:32.620]  got the courage to admit the facts and the reality even if some of you don't
[45:32.620 --> 45:39.460]  and I'm telling you ignore the reality at your certain peril this radio show is
[45:39.460 --> 45:50.140]  not some wild fantasy the horror is real the attack on Russia last Thursday is
[45:50.140 --> 45:56.660]  real the encirclement the fact that NATO troops are pouring into Georgia and
[45:56.660 --> 46:04.300]  pouring in at the airfields in Ukraine and the fact that talk of war and
[46:04.300 --> 46:08.060]  escalating conflict is increasing and Connellysa rise has been dispatched with
[46:08.060 --> 46:11.780]  her quote saying this is escalating the most dangerous things since the Cuban
[46:11.780 --> 46:19.340]  Missile Crisis and it is that's real the 20,000 nukes Russia's got pointed at us
[46:19.340 --> 46:28.660]  are real the New World Order is real times of London Georgian blockade threat
[46:28.660 --> 46:31.380]  risk escalating conflict Ukraine threatened to blockade the Russian
[46:31.380 --> 46:34.940]  Black Sea Fleet yesterday in an act of solidarity with Georgia that risk
[46:34.940 --> 46:39.580]  escalating the conflict after flying to Tbilisi to assure Georgians of the
[46:39.580 --> 46:43.420]  country support President Yashchenko signed an order imposing tough
[46:43.420 --> 46:48.340]  descriptions on the Russian fleet which is based on the Ukraine port mr.
[46:48.340 --> 46:53.100]  Shinkos decree instructs Russia to give 72 hours notice of any movement of ships
[46:53.100 --> 46:56.500]  aircraft and personnel in Ukraine the Ukraine authorities were given the power
[46:56.500 --> 47:00.780]  to alter those plans do whatever they want the Ukrainian Foreign Minister has
[47:00.780 --> 47:06.300]  already warned Russia that it will bar ships from entering the port if they
[47:06.300 --> 47:10.100]  take part in military action against Georgia Moscow responded furiously
[47:10.100 --> 47:15.020]  accusing Ukraine of a serious new anti-Russian step as the quote like Georgia
[47:15.020 --> 47:18.380]  Ukraine's pro-western leadership is seeking membership in NATO in December
[47:18.380 --> 47:24.940]  the Democratic Orange Revolution that swept mr. Yashchenko into power in 2004
[47:24.940 --> 47:28.220]  has long been low by Vladimir Putin the Russian Prime Minister because they're
[47:28.220 --> 47:34.060]  moving weapons in the Ukrainian Security Council issued a statement yesterday
[47:34.060 --> 47:38.020]  declaring that the presence of foreign warships in its waters pose a potential
[47:38.020 --> 47:41.220]  threat to Ukraine's national sovereignty particularly in parts of Russia's Black
[47:41.220 --> 47:46.820]  Sea fleet that are used against third countries Russian Ukraine are already at
[47:46.820 --> 47:50.900]  loggerheads over the future of the Crimean base which Russia must vacate in
[47:50.900 --> 47:55.060]  2017 under a 20-year lease agreement signed under the collapse of the Soviet
[47:55.060 --> 48:02.500]  Union and it goes on to say that most of the Crimean population considered
[48:02.500 --> 48:05.780]  themselves be Russian and a strong pro-Moscow tensions have mounted over
[48:05.780 --> 48:08.500]  calls for politicians in Moscow not to surrender control the territory
[48:08.500 --> 48:12.180]  regardless of Ukraine's wishes mr. Yashchenko's insist that the Black Sea
[48:12.180 --> 48:16.420]  fleet must leave on time so that's where they'll probably try to start a fight
[48:16.420 --> 48:20.140]  in the next few months and they're talking about it continuing White House
[48:20.140 --> 48:24.540]  Russian bluster will be ignored
[48:25.380 --> 48:29.020]  Russia's apparently sabotaging airfields under military infrastructure in
[48:29.020 --> 48:32.260]  Georgia as it forces pullback and a deliberate attempt to cripple the
[48:32.260 --> 48:35.980]  already battered US-trained Georgian military oh how dare Russia after they
[48:35.980 --> 48:43.540]  were snuck attack by the US NATO Georgia and Israel how dare them destroy the
[48:43.540 --> 48:47.380]  air bases that were used to launch attacks on them after they were snuck
[48:47.380 --> 48:53.140]  attack now listen to this this is out of in MN weekly mainstream Russian
[48:53.140 --> 48:57.780]  newspaper top brass defends Russia's right to bring up strikes we have links
[48:57.780 --> 49:01.060]  to the Russian general staff saying all of this and being translated in
[49:01.060 --> 49:07.820]  English Russia listen to this top brass defense right to preemptive strike with
[49:07.820 --> 49:11.380]  nuclear weapons Russia underlined its right to preventive nuclear strike this
[49:11.380 --> 49:14.380]  week and what military analysts interpreted as a move to introduce more
[49:14.380 --> 49:18.180]  clarity and the nation's defense doctrine the statements made by chief
[49:18.180 --> 49:23.380]  general staff Yuri Bolivinski on Saturday were followed by naval
[49:23.380 --> 49:27.900]  exercises in the North Atlantic that will feature before the aircraft of the
[49:27.900 --> 49:32.900]  air force the one related the developments pointed to Russia not so much as
[49:32.900 --> 49:37.380]  an offensive as a one that was eager to bring in defensive doctrine in line of
[49:37.380 --> 49:41.860]  what Western world and make it more up to date with contemporary military
[49:41.860 --> 49:45.740]  demands we are not a planning attack anyone but our partners should clearly
[49:45.740 --> 49:49.780]  understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the
[49:49.780 --> 49:52.980]  sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russian Federation and its allies
[49:52.980 --> 49:56.620]  including on the preemptive basis including the use of nuclear weapons
[49:56.620 --> 50:01.780]  that's the head of the Russian military folks that's not some bomb you know out
[50:01.780 --> 50:07.500]  panhandling RAA Novostat quoted the top general is saying Saturday at a
[50:07.500 --> 50:11.180]  scientific conference in Moscow he underlined however the military force
[50:11.180 --> 50:16.900]  can and must be used to demonstrate the defensiveness of the top leadership of
[50:16.900 --> 50:21.820]  the country only as a last resort and when all other methods have failed this
[50:21.820 --> 50:26.020]  is a clarification of nuclear doctrine so the defense expert at the dean of
[50:26.020 --> 50:29.380]  international politics department of higher school of economics told Moscow
[50:29.380 --> 50:34.300]  Times but the general means is the enhanced deterrence doctrine which was
[50:34.300 --> 50:38.700]  created in the United States and used by NATO for decades
[50:38.700 --> 50:42.380]  oh god
[50:42.380 --> 50:47.460]  meanwhile Ukraine's talking about attacking Russian territories it's just

[54:29.060 --> 54:33.380]  new world order but then he supports every policy of it it's a bait and a
[54:33.380 --> 54:36.580]  switch they do they say we need to take all our freedoms and liberties and set
[54:36.580 --> 54:40.340]  up a police state and arrest all the 9-11 truthers to fight a police state

[55:05.580 --> 55:09.780]  is under attack which is true in a way the Anglo-American arm of it that's what
[55:09.780 --> 55:12.380]  the new order always wins though they control the Russian counterpart as well
[55:12.380 --> 55:14.060]  and play them off against each other
[55:14.060 --> 55:16.500]  uh... here he is calling for the non-existent new world order that

[55:19.020 --> 55:21.420]  bush and bush senior and clinton and
[55:21.420 --> 55:24.460]  gordon brown they all call for it doesn't exist here it is
[55:24.460 --> 55:28.580]  well uh... uh... where you know it's not the fact that i was targeted my people
[55:28.580 --> 55:32.540]  has been targeted and i couldn't care less whether it is stopping the
[55:32.540 --> 55:35.060]  i mean every word sentences a lot
[55:35.060 --> 55:37.100]  your people were not targeted
[55:37.100 --> 55:41.320]  you attacked a russian enclave and slaughtered thousands in a huge sneak
[55:41.320 --> 55:42.100]  attack
[55:42.100 --> 55:44.900]  you were told that they the russians would back off the globalist new the
[55:44.900 --> 55:46.100]  russians would pour in
[55:46.100 --> 55:50.100]  then they could start a wider conflict in the region which they're now doing
[55:50.100 --> 55:52.460]  order out of chaos you dumb twit
[55:52.460 --> 55:53.860]  back to this idiot puppet
[55:53.860 --> 55:57.140]  was targeted the worst thing was that i was standing there with my people
[55:57.140 --> 56:01.220]  they were bombed and i was just target like them and as elected president
[56:01.220 --> 56:04.780]  official in charge of their protection i couldn't do anything about it
[56:04.780 --> 56:08.940]  but the point here is again is i was bombed i mean this is incredible
[56:08.940 --> 56:10.620]  this is what the police do
[56:10.620 --> 56:11.900]  on video

[56:25.460 --> 56:27.580]  just finish it finish it
[56:27.580 --> 56:28.940]  but the point here is
[56:28.940 --> 56:33.580]  it's not about me it's about the idea of freedom it's about the whole region
[56:33.580 --> 56:38.220]  it's about the future of europe and a new world order and what i think is that
[56:38.220 --> 56:40.140]  no matter what russians do
[56:40.140 --> 56:41.300]  i told them
[56:41.300 --> 56:46.140]  and i was asking what would be my message to the russian i had to play it again

[56:48.700 --> 56:49.620]  world order

[56:51.700 --> 56:54.860]  that that that we are steadily fed i've heard michael savage say we've got to
[56:54.860 --> 56:58.380]  attack and kill all the muslims because they want a new world order no they
[56:58.380 --> 57:01.340]  won't want a new world order

[57:07.940 --> 57:09.980]  it's so incredible
[57:09.980 --> 57:11.020]  play it again
[57:11.020 --> 57:12.460]  play it again
[57:12.460 --> 57:13.860]  but the point here is
[57:13.860 --> 57:18.140]  it's not about me it's about the idea of freedom you know the future of the whole
[57:18.140 --> 57:22.100]  region it's about the future of europe and that the new world order and what i

[57:29.740 --> 57:30.940]  for all these days
[57:30.940 --> 57:34.940]  no matter how much they bomb us no much no matter how much destruction they
[57:34.940 --> 57:38.060]  inflict on us no matter how they try to terrorize us
[57:38.060 --> 57:41.900]  no matter how many tanks they bring in and how many more planes they send
[57:41.900 --> 57:43.460]  one thing is clear

[1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.460]  alex jones
[1:00:22.460 --> 1:00:26.740]  russia is in a circle more u.s. troops are massing in ukraine and georgia
[1:00:26.740 --> 1:00:28.380]  bringing in armaments
[1:00:28.380 --> 1:00:31.380]  threatening to run the blockade of the ukrainian ships
[1:00:31.380 --> 1:00:33.940]  into georgia resupply with
[1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:37.780]  more high-tech weapons to shoot down russian helicopters and engage their
[1:00:37.780 --> 1:00:38.820]  tanks
[1:00:38.820 --> 1:00:41.940]  the russians have pulled back are saying please don't attack us anymore
[1:00:41.940 --> 1:00:43.820]  we'll be forced to use nuclear weapons
[1:00:43.820 --> 1:00:47.220]  nato has his own preemptive doctrine we're matching your doctrine
[1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:50.860]  the head of the russian military said this has not been our doctrine
[1:00:50.860 --> 1:00:53.860]  we have adopted a concept of preemption he says noting that it was
[1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:56.340]  previously not part of russia's doctrine
[1:00:56.340 --> 1:01:00.740]  uh... the general uh... said that in the extraordinary statements
[1:01:00.740 --> 1:01:02.380]  they will defend
[1:01:02.380 --> 1:01:05.500]  uh... russia and their allies with nuclear weapons if they're attacked
[1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:06.580]  anymore
[1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:09.340]  and one of the neocons possibly going to do
[1:01:09.340 --> 1:01:12.940]  possibly gonna attack more russian forces on the border
[1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:15.980]  and the russians will probably set off some uh...
[1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:18.460]  theater nukes and then it's
[1:01:18.460 --> 1:01:20.300]  it could happen folks
[1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:22.860]  you ever think the globalist would fly planes in the building that they attack
[1:01:22.860 --> 1:01:24.620]  iraq kill a million two
[1:01:24.620 --> 1:01:27.020]  everything they'd be setting up police states and telling cops
[1:01:27.020 --> 1:01:30.300]  go ahead and just beat random citizens up half the death and we'll we'll back
[1:01:30.300 --> 1:01:30.860]  you
[1:01:30.860 --> 1:01:33.740]  you ever think they'd be saying there's no more fourth amendment
[1:01:33.740 --> 1:01:36.940]  you ever think any of this would be happening they're just going for broke
[1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:41.140]  and they're entering in the most it's not me saying this is every other analyst
[1:01:41.140 --> 1:01:44.820]  russian u.s british nato that this is the greatest escalation
[1:01:44.820 --> 1:01:47.980]  now is beginning to eclipse the cuban missile crisis because this is a hot
[1:01:47.980 --> 1:01:48.660]  war
[1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:54.100]  this could turn into nuclear war i'm quoting them
[1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:55.660]  and uh...
[1:01:55.660 --> 1:01:59.820]  it's very very very serious
[1:01:59.820 --> 1:02:03.660]  they're starting the cold war again
[1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:07.020]  by attacking russian forces and slaughtering them and then telling the
[1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:09.100]  gullible
[1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:10.820]  i don't think there's any depth
[1:02:10.820 --> 1:02:13.300]  i was any bottom to the gullibility of
[1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:16.120]  the people of the west now i it is
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:18.940]  yet a bunch of narcissists
[1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:21.980]  a bunches do as thou wilt
[1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:24.500]  people completely obsessed with themselves
[1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:27.900]  having no connection to the greater humanity no connection to history or
[1:02:27.900 --> 1:02:29.900]  reality or facts
[1:02:29.900 --> 1:02:33.020]  they know all about the sitcoms all about their
[1:02:33.020 --> 1:02:34.540]  sports heroes
[1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:35.780]  all about
[1:02:35.780 --> 1:02:39.500]  uh... how to act tough and how to act cool and how to party and how to
[1:02:39.500 --> 1:02:40.180]  how to
[1:02:40.180 --> 1:02:42.620]  have as much sex as possible
[1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:46.020]  but they have no idea about the real world and what
[1:02:46.020 --> 1:02:48.260]  humanity in the short life is all about
[1:02:48.260 --> 1:02:51.380]  and i said i take your calls will do in the next segment but i i i hope it's
[1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:53.900]  mainly about what i've been covering the last hour

[1:02:59.100 --> 1:03:03.220]  on this thursday edition but i am very i've been saying for months and months
[1:03:03.220 --> 1:03:06.080]  and months i have never felt in my intellect
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:07.580]  in my spirit
[1:03:07.580 --> 1:03:09.920]  uh... your subconscious where you want to call it
[1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.580]  uh... because you know that the subconscious is is the majority of your
[1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:15.940]  mind of your of your intellect of your brain capacity
[1:03:15.940 --> 1:03:18.900]  the cerebral cortex only is a narrow focused
[1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:22.020]  uh...
[1:03:22.020 --> 1:03:23.420]  your blinders of it
[1:03:23.420 --> 1:03:25.000]  looking through like a straw
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.540]  it only gives you a limited perspective but but you know
[1:03:27.540 --> 1:03:30.400]  you can grasp the the the overall analysis
[1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:32.500]  in your god your god
[1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:34.900]  is is is really your
[1:03:34.900 --> 1:03:39.320]  your your your your deeper analysis you know your true mind power
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:41.860]  and you study history study facts you integrate you look at it
[1:03:41.860 --> 1:03:44.680]  then you get a feeling
[1:03:44.680 --> 1:03:47.900]  like a woman gets a feeling about a guy being a creep in nine times out of ten
[1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:50.980]  it's right or you get a feeling about a business deal being bad you get a bad
[1:03:50.980 --> 1:03:51.820]  feeling
[1:03:51.820 --> 1:03:54.580]  and and when the light turns green you say i would not drive out there and
[1:03:54.580 --> 1:03:55.460]  suddenly a car
[1:03:55.460 --> 1:03:58.020]  was by any miles an hour that would have killed you
[1:03:58.020 --> 1:04:00.620]  well it's more than just a feeling it's the facts
[1:04:00.620 --> 1:04:05.020]  i have been saying for the last year i have never felt this disquieted i did
[1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:06.600]  nothing ever came this close
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:08.580]  the last time i felt something similar
[1:04:08.580 --> 1:04:12.220]  which is only a glimmer of this
[1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:16.140]  okay uh... it was right before nine eleven that was like a big lighters
[1:04:16.140 --> 1:04:17.260]  candle power

[1:05:49.740 --> 1:05:48.620]  one fifteen minute phone call can change our lives

[1:06:00.060 --> 1:06:03.060]  available
[1:06:03.060 --> 1:06:08.060]  I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[1:06:08.060 --> 1:06:11.060]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:06:11.060 --> 1:06:14.060]  I'll do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage.
[1:06:14.060 --> 1:06:18.060]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CIFAR.
[1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:20.060]  Can we sit down and shout out?
[1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:27.060]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:06:27.060 --> 1:06:33.060]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:06:33.060 --> 1:06:37.060]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:06:37.060 --> 1:06:43.060]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:06:43.060 --> 1:06:46.060]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:06:46.060 --> 1:06:52.060]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.

[1:06:57.060 --> 1:07:00.060]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:07:00.060 --> 1:07:03.060]  I am at a gathering of friends, minding my own business.
[1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:07.060]  When one of our buddies, Bob, walks up to me, very concerned, he says,
[1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:09.060]  wow, have you seen the gasoline prices lately?
[1:07:09.060 --> 1:07:11.060]  And I said, oh, of course. Whoo, they're high.
[1:07:11.060 --> 1:07:13.060]  He says, yeah, he says, what am I going to do?
[1:07:13.060 --> 1:07:16.060]  I've got a truck. There's no way anybody's going to buy my truck in this market.
[1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:18.060]  I really need the truck for my job.
[1:07:18.060 --> 1:07:20.060]  It uses more gas than I can afford.
[1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:23.060]  I've got to find a way to come up with some extra money.
[1:07:23.060 --> 1:07:26.060]  I've got a wife with four kids at home. I don't know what to do.
[1:07:26.060 --> 1:07:28.060]  I said, Bob, relax, I know what to do.
[1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:32.060]  Call efoodsdirect.com or go up on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:38.060]  They will deliver food, really good, high quality, nutritional, delicious food to your door,
[1:07:38.060 --> 1:07:43.060]  your door now right there in front of your house for about half the price that you were paying for groceries last year.
[1:07:43.060 --> 1:07:46.060]  You can take the savings from that, offset the cost of your fuel,
[1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:51.060]  and use it to buy more inexpensive food to hedge against tomorrow's increasing food prices.
[1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:54.060]  Why don't you do that, Bob? He said, efoodsdirect.com.
[1:07:54.060 --> 1:07:57.060]  I said, yep, call them at 1-800-409-5633.
[1:07:57.060 --> 1:08:01.060]  That's 800-409-5633. Do it now.
[1:08:01.060 --> 1:08:04.060]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[1:08:04.060 --> 1:08:08.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:11.060]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[1:08:11.060 --> 1:08:13.060]  We're here live.
[1:08:13.060 --> 1:08:16.060]  This is the report we broadcast from 9 to 1 a.m.
[1:08:16.060 --> 1:08:18.060]  For stations out there that want to pick it up off the satellite
[1:08:18.060 --> 1:08:20.060]  or are already picking up some of the daytime show.
[1:08:20.060 --> 1:08:24.060]  Also, we have a free podcast daily that's going up to about 60,000 people a day
[1:08:24.060 --> 1:08:26.060]  and growing by a couple thousand a week.
[1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:28.060]  Be sure and tell your friends and family about the free podcast.
[1:08:28.060 --> 1:08:32.060]  They can listen how they want, where they want, when they want, on whatever device they like.
[1:08:32.060 --> 1:08:35.060]  Putting you completely in the driver's seat.
[1:08:35.060 --> 1:08:40.060]  There is also, of course, the fact that we restream the show for 20 hours
[1:08:40.060 --> 1:08:44.060]  after the live transmission ends each day at infowars.com.
[1:08:44.060 --> 1:08:50.060]  You can tune in to all the guests and callers and analysis and information.
[1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:53.060]  Again, I want to play that McCain clip one more time.
[1:08:53.060 --> 1:08:57.060]  This is McCain last night at a campaign speech.
[1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:00.060]  He's put out international press releases saying in Circle Russia,
[1:09:00.060 --> 1:09:02.060]  get tough with Russia, sanction Russia,
[1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:04.060]  but then he throws it to the public to sound reasonable.
[1:09:04.060 --> 1:09:06.060]  Hey, we just want to be reasonable.
[1:09:06.060 --> 1:09:08.060]  We just snuck attack you, but he didn't say that.
[1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:12.060]  And then he goes, it's, you can't have countries invading other countries for no reason
[1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:16.060]  in the 21st century when Russia was attacked.
[1:09:16.060 --> 1:09:19.060]  Again, you don't just look at something geopolitically and say,
[1:09:19.060 --> 1:09:22.060]  well, I'm an American, screw those Russians.
[1:09:22.060 --> 1:09:27.060]  You look at the facts and go, okay, the U.S. snuck attack them through Georgia with U.S. troops.
[1:09:27.060 --> 1:09:31.060]  Tom Clancy's writing books and making video games about it seven years ago
[1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:37.060]  about the U.S. launching ghost forces, special forces to attack the Russians in Ossetia
[1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:40.060]  in an international zone where they've had peace.
[1:09:40.060 --> 1:09:42.060]  They just attacked them.
[1:09:42.060 --> 1:09:48.060]  And then they send Mikhail Shashvili on to Glenn Beck for 20 minutes.
[1:09:48.060 --> 1:09:50.060]  Bob, like it's 1984, they attacked us.
[1:09:50.060 --> 1:09:52.060]  Big brother, liberty, freedom.
[1:09:52.060 --> 1:09:54.060]  We're fighting evil.
[1:09:54.060 --> 1:09:56.060]  The New World Order is fighting evil.
[1:09:56.060 --> 1:09:59.060]  The New World Order wants to save you.
[1:09:59.060 --> 1:10:01.060]  I mean, bizarre.
[1:10:01.060 --> 1:10:02.060]  We need to fight George Arwell.
[1:10:02.060 --> 1:10:04.060]  We need the New World Order.
[1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:07.060]  People see that and go, I get calls all the time.
[1:10:07.060 --> 1:10:12.060]  Well, Glenn Beck talks about the fight the New World Order and the fight Orwell.
[1:10:12.060 --> 1:10:14.060]  And then he supports every Orwellian system.
[1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:16.060]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:18.060]  This is all Pentagon designed.
[1:10:18.060 --> 1:10:21.060]  I mean, believe me, only the Pentagon can get Shashvili on that show.
[1:10:21.060 --> 1:10:24.060]  Play McCain.
[1:10:24.060 --> 1:10:29.060]  I don't think we're going to reignite the Cold War here with Russia.
[1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:32.060]  I think this is a very serious situation.
[1:10:32.060 --> 1:10:38.060]  I don't see this as a return to nuclear standoffs, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:40.060]  I want to have a dialogue with the Russians.
[1:10:40.060 --> 1:10:46.060]  I want them to get out of Georgian territory as quickly as possible.
[1:10:46.060 --> 1:10:51.060]  And I am interested in good relations between the United States and Russia.
[1:10:51.060 --> 1:10:57.060]  But in the 21st century, nations don't invade other nations.
[1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:03.060]  Well, Shashvili again.
[1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:05.060]  But the point here is it's not about me.
[1:11:05.060 --> 1:11:07.060]  It's about the idea of freedom.
[1:11:07.060 --> 1:11:09.060]  It's about the future of the whole region.
[1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:12.060]  It's about the future of Europe and the New World Order.
[1:11:12.060 --> 1:11:17.060]  And what I think is that no matter what Russians do, I told them.
[1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:19.060]  And then he goes on to say, Russia snuck attack them.
[1:11:19.060 --> 1:11:22.060]  I mean, this is, and people believe this stuff.
[1:11:22.060 --> 1:11:28.060]  Man.
[1:11:28.060 --> 1:11:33.060]  They are starting a new Cold War.
[1:11:33.060 --> 1:11:34.060]  But this isn't cold.
[1:11:34.060 --> 1:11:35.060]  This is hot.
[1:11:35.060 --> 1:11:41.060]  They are all over Russia's borders, moving weapons in all around them.
[1:11:41.060 --> 1:11:46.060]  In what, 10 different nations at least from the stands right into Poland.
[1:11:46.060 --> 1:11:48.060]  And Russia is, stop it, stop it, stop it.
[1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:54.060]  Russia isn't expanding around the world, they're contracting.
[1:11:54.060 --> 1:11:58.060]  But Russia cannot be allowed to bring all that oil and natural gas to market.
[1:11:58.060 --> 1:12:01.060]  So they have to be encircled and shot down.
[1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:04.060]  And then the Georgian little dictator, and he is a dictator.
[1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:06.060]  I mean, he got elected in a staged election.
[1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:11.060]  But now he's set up a police state, secret arrest, banning independent media,
[1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:14.060]  running around with these big lectures about freedom.
[1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:18.060]  Well, let me tell you, Alexander Shultz and Niedsen wrote two years ago, and he died, of course, last week,
[1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:23.060]  that Russia was being encircled and the U.S. was planning to start proxy wars against them.
[1:12:23.060 --> 1:12:26.060]  You can just type in Alexander Shultz and Niedsen, click Google News.
[1:12:26.060 --> 1:12:29.060]  There's a whole bunch of mainstream articles about his article two years ago.
[1:12:29.060 --> 1:12:35.060]  And he predicted all of this because it's in public NATO documents that they were planning this.
[1:12:35.060 --> 1:12:39.060]  It's in the PNAC documents.
[1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:41.060]  Man.
[1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:43.060]  Man, this is bad.
[1:12:43.060 --> 1:12:45.060]  Let's go to Thomas and Tennessee.
[1:12:45.060 --> 1:12:47.060]  For those that don't know, again, it's escalating.
[1:12:47.060 --> 1:12:49.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is escalating.
[1:12:49.060 --> 1:12:51.060]  Russia is pulling back and it's escalating.
[1:12:51.060 --> 1:12:52.060]  They're going to keep poking them.
[1:12:52.060 --> 1:12:54.060]  Thomas and Tennessee.
[1:12:54.060 --> 1:12:55.060]  Hey, how are you doing?
[1:12:55.060 --> 1:12:56.060]  Good.
[1:12:56.060 --> 1:13:00.060]  Hey, listen, I just got an email from a friend of mine who was working with a guy left,
[1:13:00.060 --> 1:13:03.060]  what he was doing, working with computers, and go to work with FEMA.
[1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:05.060]  He just got an email this morning.
[1:13:05.060 --> 1:13:07.060]  He emailed me about a couple hours ago.
[1:13:07.060 --> 1:13:11.060]  And he said that FEMA is preparing for the possibility of continuity of government.
[1:13:11.060 --> 1:13:13.060]  And he said it sounds pretty scary.
[1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:15.060]  He said, if you need me, come to Mount Weather and knock.
[1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:17.060]  I don't know what that means.
[1:13:17.060 --> 1:13:23.060]  But he said, uh, he said, uh, that, uh, they don't do this unless there's a reason.
[1:13:23.060 --> 1:13:27.060]  And he basically, the last thing he said was just start praying.
[1:13:27.060 --> 1:13:33.060]  Well, they've got five, three battle fleets now, two more carrier task forces entering the Gulf.
[1:13:33.060 --> 1:13:36.060]  Israel's saying they might go ahead and hit Iran.
[1:13:36.060 --> 1:13:38.060]  You've got them attacking Russia.
[1:13:38.060 --> 1:13:40.060]  I mean, this is all, that's what I'm telling you.
[1:13:40.060 --> 1:13:45.060]  And I don't need to even hear that email from your friend to know that they need continuity of government.
[1:13:45.060 --> 1:13:47.060]  Every year they declare a new emergency.
[1:13:47.060 --> 1:13:49.060]  This is how the martial law grid goes in.
[1:13:49.060 --> 1:13:53.060]  They've got a Pentagon grid in with federalized police to control the population.
[1:13:53.060 --> 1:13:56.060]  And they're steering us towards a draft in World War three.
[1:13:56.060 --> 1:14:02.060]  And, uh, uh, it's just so horrible what's happening.
[1:14:02.060 --> 1:14:04.060]  Do you have his email in front of you? You want to read it?
[1:14:04.060 --> 1:14:06.060]  Yeah.
[1:14:06.060 --> 1:14:13.060]  I mean, listen, they didn't train 26,000 preachers to give sermons being paid by FEMA for three years.
[1:14:13.060 --> 1:14:16.060]  We made it public two years ago, mainstream news a year ago.
[1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:18.060]  Again, everything we tell you is right.
[1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:20.060]  Even before it's in the news, we know what we're talking about.
[1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:24.060]  To have them give sermons about turning your guns in, taking inoculations,
[1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:27.060]  letting your families be split up and going to FEMA camps.
[1:14:27.060 --> 1:14:32.060]  See that the attack starting a war with Russia is about the, the, the continuity of government,
[1:14:32.060 --> 1:14:39.060]  North com enslaving us, staging the terror attacks and moving our troops in the Middle East was about menacing Russia.
[1:14:39.060 --> 1:14:41.060]  It's all part of a larger plan folks.
[1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:43.060]  We're all under attack.
[1:14:43.060 --> 1:14:44.060]  Our government is gone.
[1:14:44.060 --> 1:14:46.060]  Read us the email.
[1:14:46.060 --> 1:14:53.060]  He said, um, the subject is a COG and he said FEMA is preparing for the possibility of going to COG
[1:14:53.060 --> 1:14:56.060]  and in parentheses, continuity of government mode.
[1:14:56.060 --> 1:14:58.060]  We're already in that, but then he means a higher degree.
[1:14:58.060 --> 1:14:59.060]  Yeah.
[1:14:59.060 --> 1:15:02.060]  It's scary in it, the word scary with three explanation points.
[1:15:02.060 --> 1:15:05.060]  If you need me, just come to Mount weather and knock.
[1:15:05.060 --> 1:15:06.060]  I will let you in.
[1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:07.060]  Yeah, right.
[1:15:07.060 --> 1:15:10.060]  You have, yeah, you have to use the secret knock.
[1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:14.060]  If you don't know Anton will show you, maybe I shouldn't.
[1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:15.060]  Hey, jokes here.
[1:15:15.060 --> 1:15:17.060]  Maybe I shouldn't have showed a rush in that knock.
[1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:20.060]  See, they said seriously, they're really getting ready.
[1:15:20.060 --> 1:15:22.060]  They don't do that unless there's a reason.
[1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:26.060]  He then he says the last thing he said was time to start praying and he leaves his name.
[1:15:26.060 --> 1:15:28.060]  But I mean, do you know him?
[1:15:28.060 --> 1:15:34.060]  Uh, my friend, um, that I've gone to college with, uh, works in the computer department
[1:15:34.060 --> 1:15:37.060]  and he left a few months ago to go work for FEMA.
[1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:41.060]  Obviously he had some people there that already was inviting them to go work there because,
[1:15:41.060 --> 1:15:44.060]  you know, they're computer tech guys.
[1:15:44.060 --> 1:15:50.060]  Well, they've got Adam and Eve centers all over the country with 5,000 people per facility.
[1:15:50.060 --> 1:15:54.060]  They can live for several years underground nuclear reactors, powering underground railway systems
[1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:57.060]  that are declassified, probably much bigger than what they tell us.
[1:15:57.060 --> 1:16:01.060]  That undoubtedly, uh, this is how they get the police state.
[1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:06.060]  This is how they get us into a horrible war where we rally around them so they can hurt us even worse.
[1:16:06.060 --> 1:16:08.060]  And, uh, hey.
[1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:14.060]  Well, Mount Weather, Mount Weather, I looked up the, uh, some of the different, um, areas they have
[1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:17.060]  and they have like, uh, different Raven Rock and Mount Pony.
[1:16:17.060 --> 1:16:21.060]  And this is over in the western part of Virginia near, uh, Virginia Tech.
[1:16:21.060 --> 1:16:24.060]  Then they got Side R, the Side R over in Maryland.
[1:16:24.060 --> 1:16:28.060]  They got the Briar, Briar Green Hotel, which used to have the connections to the railways.
[1:16:28.060 --> 1:16:31.060]  They've closed that one, the underground railways.
[1:16:31.060 --> 1:16:34.060]  Well, I don't, depending on how long it's going to take, we just got the email.
[1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:37.060]  It could be, you know, who knows, this week, next week, next month.
[1:16:37.060 --> 1:16:40.060]  Well, they don't even need to start a full war with Russia and I appreciate your call.
[1:16:40.060 --> 1:16:44.060]  Uh, just, just, just getting the government scared, getting their minions scared.
[1:16:44.060 --> 1:16:46.060]  They'll do anything now.
[1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:48.060]  Uh, bringing more of the shadow government into control.
[1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:51.060]  It was the shadow government, continuity government program, uh,
[1:16:51.060 --> 1:16:54.060]  and the five jumbo jets flying around that coordinate that.
[1:16:54.060 --> 1:16:55.060]  That's what table enemies covers.
[1:16:55.060 --> 1:17:01.060]  Part of it, Burmese's new film, uh, that gets into all that.
[1:17:01.060 --> 1:17:10.060]  By having that in place and expanding it, they get to, uh, basically get even greater control over the rest of the federal agencies.
[1:17:10.060 --> 1:17:12.060]  Issly in Florida, you're on the air.
[1:17:12.060 --> 1:17:15.060]  Hi, Alex. How you doing?
[1:17:15.060 --> 1:17:17.060]  Good. I've just got a really bad feeling.
[1:17:17.060 --> 1:17:19.060]  No, I know. I know.
[1:17:19.060 --> 1:17:22.060]  It's, it's getting rough. Everything's coming to a head.
[1:17:22.060 --> 1:17:27.060]  Uh, on our side too, though, I mean, I think we've got a lot of things to, uh, to be positive about.
[1:17:27.060 --> 1:17:38.060]  I mean, there's a lot of people awake because of you and, uh, because of Jesse Ventura and, uh, you know, Jesse says he's got to be out of the country by November.
[1:17:38.060 --> 1:17:40.060]  Uh, and then he won't really say why.
[1:17:40.060 --> 1:17:42.060]  He says he doesn't want to be here for the election.
[1:17:42.060 --> 1:17:44.060]  I mean, everybody in the know is leaving the country.
[1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:46.060]  I keep telling people that.
[1:17:46.060 --> 1:17:49.060]  Yeah, no, I know. I know. It's, uh...
[1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:53.060]  I mean, you had to have it, you black scheme-ass idiots. All of you could serve the system.
[1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:59.060]  You had to have it, didn't you? You had to let evil take over and sell us on torture of children and sell us on all this crap.
[1:17:59.060 --> 1:18:02.060]  We have these murderers that carried out 9-11 running things.
[1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:06.060]  It isn't going to end when Obama gets in or whoever. It's going to go on and on.
[1:18:06.060 --> 1:18:09.060]  But this looks like it may not even be an election if this continues.
[1:18:09.060 --> 1:18:13.060]  There's no reason. There's no reason for all this. It's absolutely crazy.
[1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:20.060]  But there is one thing I want to talk to you about, Alex, is that we got to make a big presence in Minnesota.
[1:18:20.060 --> 1:18:32.060]  I see that there's only like 8,000 and some close to 9,000 tickets sold, and it's like 15,000 people, you know, that need to show a presence there.
[1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:37.060]  Well, we need those 15,000 people to go out and hand out terror storm DVDs and call every talk show and say,
[1:18:37.060 --> 1:18:43.060]  we don't want war with Russia, the US attack, Russia to start this. What we need is for people to call every talk show,
[1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:48.060]  go on every blog, every message board, tell their neighbors we don't want a war with Iran.
[1:18:48.060 --> 1:18:51.060]  And when you have people can go to the wrong poll thing, that's fine and dandy.
[1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:55.060]  You know, the point here is we're kind of getting past all that time now, folks.
[1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:57.060]  I mean, this is the danger zone. This is it.
[1:18:57.060 --> 1:19:02.060]  Alex, I mean, it'll be all over CNN though and everything else, and people do need to see that.
[1:19:02.060 --> 1:19:03.060]  I mean, I think.
[1:19:03.060 --> 1:19:05.060]  They do. They do. I'm supporting it. I have them on.
[1:19:05.060 --> 1:19:07.060]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
[1:19:07.060 --> 1:19:14.060]  And I wanted to real quick point everybody to the website rally for the republic t-shirt.com.
[1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:16.060]  Is that your website?
[1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:23.060]  Yeah, it's a t-shirt that we made in honor of you and in honor of Jesse Ventura and Ron Paul.
[1:19:23.060 --> 1:19:25.060]  Oh, really? What's on it?
[1:19:25.060 --> 1:19:30.060]  It's just you three guys in front of an American flag looking real cool.
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:35.060]  And then it says rally for the republic 2008 at the bottom.
[1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:40.060]  And it's rally for the republic t-shirt.com.
[1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:41.060]  Yeah, okay. Thank you.
[1:19:41.060 --> 1:19:42.060]  Oh, God.
[1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:46.060]  I'm just depressed, folks. I'm not even depressed.
[1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:49.060]  I'm just, people think evil's cute. They think it's all funny.
[1:19:49.060 --> 1:19:52.060]  They think lying's funny. They think all this corruption's funny.
[1:19:52.060 --> 1:19:53.060]  It isn't funny, folks.
[1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:55.060]  None of it's funny.
[1:19:55.060 --> 1:20:00.060]  We're all going to get hurt real bad before this is over.
[1:20:30.060 --> 1:20:36.060]  We've got the most well researched and documented titles all available at prisonplanet.com.

[1:21:01.060 --> 1:21:05.060]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:05.060 --> 1:21:10.060]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us, it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:10.060 --> 1:21:23.060]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million, the vast majority of the population of the US, though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:26.060]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:26.060 --> 1:21:31.060]  They are called Illuminati, elite, proponents of the new world order.
[1:21:31.060 --> 1:21:34.060]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:50.060]  The line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago, everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated, the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses, the destruction of the earth and mankind, we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.

[1:23:00.060 --> 1:23:16.060]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[1:23:16.060 --> 1:23:30.060]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[1:23:30.060 --> 1:23:42.060]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[1:23:42.060 --> 1:24:00.060]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237. When investing, always proceed with caution. Again, call 1-800-686-2237. Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately. 1-800-686-2237.
[1:24:00.060 --> 1:24:16.060]  Yeah, make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order has put us all in the danger zone and it's not cute, it's not funny, it's not Tom Cruise wearing aviator glasses, it's not Goose dying.
[1:24:16.060 --> 1:24:44.060]  It's death camps. It's forced inoculations. It's devil dogs having their way with you. Foreign mercenaries. Aggravated felons swelling the ranks of our military.
[1:24:44.060 --> 1:25:00.060]  Spreading the dark wings. As they shove the tyranny into overdrive.
[1:25:00.060 --> 1:25:22.060]  The birth of world government is upon us. To be born out of blood and war, sorrow and lies.
[1:25:22.060 --> 1:25:38.060]  Five aircraft carrier battle groups lining up. Russian military bases hit in a sneak attack. Georgian dictator calls for world government and says that's the good guys.
[1:25:38.060 --> 1:25:54.060]  Top Russian general threatens nuclear strikes. If any more aggression is taken against Russian forces, the U.S. answers by moving in U.S. military and mercenaries.
[1:25:54.060 --> 1:26:12.060]  They are massing their conventional weapons in Tbilisi. Just 30 miles south of Ossetia. U.S. forces, NATO forces and Israeli forces are massing in Ukraine.
[1:26:12.060 --> 1:26:30.060]  Czechoslovakia and Poland. Large contingents of troops are being pulled out of South Korea. You want war, you want tyranny, all you tough guys out there.
[1:26:30.060 --> 1:26:46.060]  You want MIRB ICBMs incinerating your families. You may just get what you want. Nation of 50 million abortions.
[1:26:46.060 --> 1:27:04.060]  This nation of wickedness. This nation of lies. This nation where we guard our police and ring-rate uniforms. You think evil is sexy?
[1:27:04.060 --> 1:27:22.060]  You think the stench of death is beautiful? Well, you're going to take a ride into the danger zone. All the tough guy U.S. military that's used to killing unarmed or untrained Muslims.
[1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:34.060]  Well, you just had fun with the danger zone and an army that can actually fight back. And I hope things would de-escalate. And I, last few days, said hopefully things will de-escalate.
[1:27:34.060 --> 1:27:42.060]  Instead, they're massively escalating all of it. But Keith and Ohio disagree, so you skip ahead of Elliott and Robert and Brent and Rod. Keith, you're on the air.
[1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:52.060]  Well, Alex, I appreciate all your research over the years and so forth. A couple things I really disagree with. Number one, the satanic music. You know, that's not going to help things.
[1:27:52.060 --> 1:28:04.060]  You know, Led Zeppelin, ACDC and so forth. But also, too, I really appreciate a lot of your work and so forth. But the man-centered solutions won't really work. It has to be God-centered.
[1:28:04.060 --> 1:28:14.060]  I need to go to the preacher and put him on hold. So I know I need to go to one of the local 26,000 churches, which are under FEMA command with federally written doctrine.
[1:28:14.060 --> 1:28:19.060]  In Romans 13, let my children go into a death camp. I understand. Go ahead.
[1:28:19.060 --> 1:28:22.060]  No, no, I don't preach that.
[1:28:22.060 --> 1:28:29.060]  Yeah, I know. But see, if you say that on air and people say, you know, turn it over to God, I have turned it over to God.
[1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:31.060]  I am speaking out against the New World Order.
[1:28:31.060 --> 1:28:37.060]  I'm saying, having a few preachers that will preach the word of God, like the Lord Jesus Christ said it, he is the authority.
[1:28:37.060 --> 1:28:41.060]  He said, and not you or me or anybody else, Luke 12, 4.
[1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:49.060]  I say unto you, see, the ship is going down. There's only one thing, there's only one lifeboat that is getting saved.
[1:28:49.060 --> 1:28:51.060]  People are being washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:53.060]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:59.060]  Hold on a minute. What I'm saying is, people need to realize, though, I'm just going to say, go to church.
[1:28:59.060 --> 1:29:03.060]  I need to explain to people that most of those are now FEMA command bunkers.
[1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:08.060]  Well, definitely Satan's greatest work of the whole lot is organized Christianity, but Jesus is good.
[1:29:08.060 --> 1:29:10.060]  The Bible is good. Your King James is good.
[1:29:10.060 --> 1:29:14.060]  So you need to have on a few preachers, like preaching Luke 12, 4, where it says,
[1:29:14.060 --> 1:29:20.060]  I say unto you, my friends, Jesus speaking, but be not afraid of them that kill the body.
[1:29:20.060 --> 1:29:22.060]  And after that, have no more that they can do.
[1:29:22.060 --> 1:29:23.060]  But those that can kill the spirit.
[1:29:23.060 --> 1:29:31.060]  Yeah, cast into hell. So people need to get real and get real faith and get real repentance and get real with the Lord and get born again, get converted.
[1:29:31.060 --> 1:29:36.060]  I appreciate your call, sir. We do have pastors on this show. You must not be listening.
[1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:42.060]  But I would get the beam out of your eye before you get the speck out of mine.
[1:29:42.060 --> 1:29:47.060]  This is a new show. It's exciting. It's aggressive and it's successful against the new world order.
[1:29:47.060 --> 1:29:51.060]  So say what you want. We'll be right back.
[1:29:51.060 --> 1:29:55.060]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.060 --> 1:30:21.060]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:21.060 --> 1:30:31.060]  We're on the march.
[1:30:51.060 --> 1:30:56.260]  0274, that's 866-497-0274.

[1:31:00.660 --> 1:31:04.100]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:31:04.100 --> 1:31:06.420]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:31:06.420 --> 1:31:09.700]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:12.500]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:31:12.500 --> 1:31:16.500]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[1:31:16.500 --> 1:31:19.220]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[1:31:19.220 --> 1:31:22.500]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.

[1:31:27.220 --> 1:31:31.220]  so I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[1:31:31.220 --> 1:31:32.820]  Travel less, meet online.

[1:32:00.900 --> 1:32:05.460]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[1:32:05.460 --> 1:32:10.020]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:32:10.020 --> 1:32:12.820]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[1:32:12.820 --> 1:32:16.500]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:32:17.060 --> 1:32:22.260]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement
[1:32:23.220 --> 1:32:25.940]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:32:25.940 --> 1:32:28.820]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[1:32:28.820 --> 1:32:33.060]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:32:33.060 --> 1:32:36.260]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:32:36.260 --> 1:32:42.020]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:32:42.020 --> 1:32:45.140]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[1:32:54.020 --> 1:32:56.500]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[1:32:56.500 --> 1:32:59.060]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:32:59.060 --> 1:33:05.300]  As we've been trodding on the wine press,
[1:33:05.300 --> 1:33:07.860]  Merged too long to prevail.
[1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:12.740]  Babylon is the vampire.
[1:33:14.260 --> 1:33:19.060]  Populance system is the vampire.
[1:33:19.060 --> 1:33:24.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:33:24.260 --> 1:33:29.300]  Sucking the children day by day.
[1:33:29.300 --> 1:33:31.460]  Sucking the children day by day.
[1:33:31.460 --> 1:33:32.980]  Babylon.
[1:33:32.980 --> 1:33:40.260]  Mr. D. Babylon system is the vampire.
[1:33:40.260 --> 1:33:42.580]  Wal-Mart, a vampire.
[1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:44.420]  Target, a vampire.
[1:33:44.420 --> 1:33:50.020]  Sucking the blood of the separatists.
[1:33:50.020 --> 1:33:52.100]  Notice how they're doing better now that the economy's worse
[1:33:52.100 --> 1:33:53.620]  as everything shuts down around them.
[1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.140]  Their profits shoot to the roof, 17%.
[1:34:01.460 --> 1:34:06.260]  Everything they do consolidates, destroys, weakens, mutates.
[1:34:06.260 --> 1:34:15.220]  Deceiving the people continually.
[1:34:26.740 --> 1:34:33.300]  You know, I have had hundreds of liberals in person,
[1:34:33.300 --> 1:34:37.940]  hundreds of emails, hundreds of websites I've come across
[1:34:37.940 --> 1:34:40.420]  where they say, I never understood the Second Amendment
[1:34:40.420 --> 1:34:42.980]  until I heard Alex Jones de-politicize it and explain it.
[1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:45.300]  I never understood that abortion was bad until I explained it
[1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:49.140]  was eugenics and anti-human and had been sold as a false right.
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:51.220]  They have these corrupt Republicans say, oh,
[1:34:51.220 --> 1:34:53.620]  use it as a football, make it a political issue,
[1:34:53.620 --> 1:34:56.100]  and the Democrats think it's some type of sacrament.
[1:34:56.100 --> 1:35:03.140]  We've actually been able to convince a lot of people
[1:35:03.140 --> 1:35:05.300]  not to kill their children,
[1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:06.740]  that there's a talk show host on this network
[1:35:06.740 --> 1:35:09.620]  who's admitted they were getting ready to abort their son
[1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:11.060]  until they heard this radio show.
[1:35:13.940 --> 1:35:17.540]  And that's because we understand the New World Order system.
[1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:19.300]  We understand the programming.
[1:35:19.300 --> 1:35:21.220]  We understand how to cut right past all that.
[1:35:22.180 --> 1:35:24.660]  And so all I hear is a bunch of King James this,
[1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:28.100]  King James that, which is great and just constant.
[1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:29.620]  You better get yourself a lot right with God.
[1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:30.580]  But what does that mean?
[1:35:31.940 --> 1:35:32.820]  What does that mean?
[1:35:35.060 --> 1:35:37.220]  You need to get out of the churches and get on the streets.
[1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:38.980]  You need to not scram.
[1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:41.460]  Every time I've seen, almost every time I've seen a street preacher,
[1:35:41.460 --> 1:35:44.100]  they're not loving, they're not focused, they're not strong.
[1:35:44.100 --> 1:35:47.460]  They're wild-eyed crazies screaming and yelling
[1:35:47.460 --> 1:35:49.700]  and spitting at people saying, don't murder your babies,
[1:35:49.700 --> 1:35:50.500]  don't abort them.
[1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:54.100]  You know, if you came with a flyer going, it's eugenics.
[1:35:54.100 --> 1:35:54.820]  It's a program.
[1:35:54.820 --> 1:35:56.420]  They want to rob you of family.
[1:35:56.420 --> 1:35:58.180]  It gives women cancer to have abortions.
[1:35:58.180 --> 1:36:01.220]  You get like, depending on the study, a five to some study,
[1:36:01.220 --> 1:36:05.620]  eight-fold increase in cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer.
[1:36:05.620 --> 1:36:07.700]  You know, instead of really being smart about it,
[1:36:12.900 --> 1:36:15.460]  I mean, I know that I'm doing the best I can.
[1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:18.420]  And I know we're doing whatever we can to bring in the widest audience.
[1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:22.260]  You don't like rock and roll music on this show?
[1:36:22.260 --> 1:36:24.500]  Well, I didn't have it on this show for years.
[1:36:24.500 --> 1:36:28.820]  But to sound like mainline talk radio, to have worldly people tune in,
[1:36:31.140 --> 1:36:32.660]  this is a dynamic.
[1:36:32.660 --> 1:36:33.940]  And we got Bob Marley.
[1:36:33.940 --> 1:36:36.660]  We got all this mix of music, classical music, you name it.
[1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:38.980]  It's a mix of stuff of every genre, country.
[1:36:39.940 --> 1:36:41.700]  But people say, I shouldn't have Merle Haggard on.
[1:36:41.700 --> 1:36:43.140]  He's not a Christian or whatever.
[1:36:43.140 --> 1:36:44.500]  I don't know if that's true.
[1:36:44.500 --> 1:36:48.980]  The point here is that I am doing what I'm doing and that is it.
[1:36:48.980 --> 1:36:53.940]  And we are getting people to wake up and not kill their babies,
[1:36:53.940 --> 1:36:55.460]  not kill the fruit of their lives.
[1:36:55.460 --> 1:36:57.380]  The most wonderful blessing they'll ever have.
[1:36:57.380 --> 1:36:59.220]  You don't know until you have children.
[1:36:59.220 --> 1:37:02.900]  It is better than all the gold in the hills, every Lamborghini,
[1:37:02.900 --> 1:37:03.940]  every mansion.
[1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:07.940]  It's all just crud, dirty rags compared to the family.
[1:37:07.940 --> 1:37:09.940]  The only thing good in this world is the family.
[1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:16.260]  That's why they attack that heart of everything.
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:21.220]  The true, I mean humans, a man doesn't make up the species.
[1:37:21.220 --> 1:37:22.740]  A woman doesn't make up the species.
[1:37:22.740 --> 1:37:24.420]  But a man and woman together do.
[1:37:25.220 --> 1:37:27.860]  They turn men against women, women against men,
[1:37:27.860 --> 1:37:29.540]  black against white, old against young.
[1:37:29.540 --> 1:37:30.980]  They bring us into these conflicts.
[1:37:33.300 --> 1:37:35.700]  Then they become self-fulfilling systems.
[1:37:38.340 --> 1:37:41.300]  When it is the individual with their family together,
[1:37:41.300 --> 1:37:43.300]  that's the true unit.
[1:37:43.300 --> 1:37:46.420]  The man, the woman, the son, the daughter, the grandchildren.
[1:37:46.420 --> 1:37:48.660]  That is a spiritual thing.
[1:37:48.660 --> 1:37:49.860]  That is a high thing.
[1:37:49.860 --> 1:37:54.580]  That is the greatest thing, the pinnacle,
[1:37:56.980 --> 1:37:59.860]  the heart of everything.
[1:38:02.820 --> 1:38:04.820]  You think you're safe from a corrupt government?
[1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:06.420]  Well, what type of people do we have in this country?
[1:38:07.620 --> 1:38:10.820]  Most of the population, warehouses, they're elderly.
[1:38:10.820 --> 1:38:13.700]  They let them die of bed sores covered in urine,
[1:38:13.700 --> 1:38:15.380]  even at the nicer facilities.
[1:38:15.380 --> 1:38:18.500]  They warehouse them away as they sit there watching TV
[1:38:18.500 --> 1:38:19.780]  and dying in pain.
[1:38:21.700 --> 1:38:24.420]  They set up an economic system once they destroyed the family
[1:38:24.420 --> 1:38:26.740]  to where most people can't even afford to keep their parents at home.
[1:38:26.740 --> 1:38:29.620]  Or if you try, elder services comes and steals them from you
[1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:31.940]  and shepherds them off to euthanize them.
[1:38:33.540 --> 1:38:37.060]  You think they're going to stop with 50 plus million abortions?
[1:38:38.340 --> 1:38:39.700]  My detractors are so wicked,
[1:38:39.700 --> 1:38:42.980]  they go and find some five-year-old show where I say 46 million
[1:38:42.980 --> 1:38:44.980]  and they edit together with me saying 50 million
[1:38:44.980 --> 1:38:45.860]  and say, look, he's lying.
[1:38:45.860 --> 1:38:47.220]  He won't even tell you the number of abortions.
[1:38:47.220 --> 1:38:49.620]  There's all manner of deception going on against us, folks.
[1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:53.940]  But you should listen to the show and listen to all of it
[1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:56.740]  and truly gauge the fullness of what we're doing here.
[1:38:58.740 --> 1:39:01.780]  I burn with a desire to sacrifice myself
[1:39:01.780 --> 1:39:03.060]  in the fight against tyranny.
[1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:05.220]  That means in my time, my energy, my name,
[1:39:05.220 --> 1:39:09.460]  I burn with sorrow.
[1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:15.380]  It hurts bad
[1:39:18.180 --> 1:39:21.140]  to know that everywhere tyranny is abusing innocents
[1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:23.700]  that are dumbed down, poisoned, brain damaged
[1:39:23.700 --> 1:39:26.020]  by the chemicals, the biologicals we're all under attack by.
[1:39:28.260 --> 1:39:30.580]  I know that everywhere the weak are cornered,
[1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:32.100]  being ripped apart, being tortured.
[1:39:32.100 --> 1:39:34.340]  Their cries are like beautiful music
[1:39:34.340 --> 1:39:38.100]  to the ears of their sadistic psychopathic dungeon keepers.
[1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:43.860]  I see the public seduced by evil, seduced by darkness at every turn.
[1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:53.300]  Rivers of blood and pus and pain pour out across the planet.
[1:39:54.340 --> 1:39:56.020]  Everything beautiful is defaced.
[1:39:57.060 --> 1:40:00.340]  Genetic engineered cross PCs, organisms are spreading
[1:40:00.340 --> 1:40:04.100]  into every facet of the biosphere, the atmosphere,
[1:40:04.100 --> 1:40:06.740]  into the ocean, into the trees, into the dirt,
[1:40:06.740 --> 1:40:08.900]  into the ground, into our bodies, into our genetics.
[1:40:10.580 --> 1:40:11.700]  This is pure evil.
[1:40:11.700 --> 1:40:14.980]  This is pit of hell evil just as coming into life
[1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:17.860]  and beauty and honor in the natural order of things,
[1:40:17.860 --> 1:40:23.220]  like a mad bull on PCP just frothing and slicing
[1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:24.660]  and bashing in a china shop.
[1:40:27.540 --> 1:40:30.900]  Their minions, their little new world order gremlins
[1:40:30.900 --> 1:40:35.060]  take each piece of china with pleasure and just smash it on the ground.
[1:40:35.060 --> 1:40:36.260]  But it isn't china.
[1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:37.780]  It's little children.
[1:40:37.780 --> 1:40:38.420]  It's women.
[1:40:38.420 --> 1:40:39.060]  It's men.
[1:40:39.060 --> 1:40:40.580]  It's individuals.
[1:40:40.580 --> 1:40:41.380]  It's families.
[1:40:41.380 --> 1:40:42.340]  It's cultures.
[1:40:42.340 --> 1:40:44.900]  It's biological systems.
[1:40:47.060 --> 1:40:50.020]  The very fabric, the very heart, the very core.
[1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:53.780]  When new order says their gods,
[1:40:53.780 --> 1:40:56.020]  they say that they are remaking the world in their image
[1:40:56.020 --> 1:40:56.900]  and it is their image.
[1:40:56.900 --> 1:41:07.780]  It is a blasphemous, stinking, reeking, scruffulous vortex
[1:41:07.780 --> 1:41:09.940]  of death and pain and anguish.
[1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:13.700]  It is a dimensional shift into hell.
[1:41:13.700 --> 1:41:29.540]  It is the gates of Hades being opened and all the anxiety
[1:41:29.540 --> 1:41:30.820]  feel isn't about the economy.
[1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:32.500]  It isn't about biological weapons threats.
[1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:33.780]  It isn't about nuclear threat.
[1:41:33.780 --> 1:41:37.220]  It isn't about that's all just just window dressing.
[1:41:37.220 --> 1:41:43.300]  It is your soul feeling the cold wicked darkness
[1:41:43.300 --> 1:41:48.100]  and the stench of death and the mirthful demonic smiles
[1:41:48.100 --> 1:41:51.220]  of our enemies as they rampage around all of us
[1:41:51.220 --> 1:41:53.860]  diluting and twisting and seducing.
[1:41:53.860 --> 1:42:08.820]  And all of the sellouts, these soulless individuals,
[1:42:10.100 --> 1:42:17.060]  these animated marionettes, painted dolls, puppets,
[1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:20.660]  only driven by mindless ego, aggression and competitiveness,
[1:42:20.660 --> 1:42:22.340]  the Glenbacks, the Michael Sabbage,
[1:42:22.340 --> 1:42:24.900]  the Rimbauds, the Hillary and Bill Clinton's,
[1:42:24.900 --> 1:42:29.380]  the all of them, the George Bushes,
[1:42:29.380 --> 1:42:32.340]  the Jiang Zemin's, the Vladimir Putin's.
[1:42:37.860 --> 1:42:39.620]  Vladimir Putin is undoubtedly a wicked man,
[1:42:39.620 --> 1:42:41.700]  but you look at him, he looks scared.
[1:42:43.140 --> 1:42:45.540]  He looks like he stared into the depths of freezing
[1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:46.580]  Ninth Circle of Hell.
[1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:49.060]  To look at our Western politicians,
[1:42:49.060 --> 1:42:54.660]  they're giggling, smirking, just radiating weakness and filth.
[1:42:54.660 --> 1:42:56.500]  And that's why they grasp at power
[1:42:57.220 --> 1:42:59.700]  and it evaporates in their hands as fast as they grab it.
[1:43:05.620 --> 1:43:06.980]  They're all caught up in a lie.
[1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:08.740]  They're all being led towards destruction.
[1:43:10.260 --> 1:43:12.980]  They think they're being offered advanced life extension
[1:43:12.980 --> 1:43:16.100]  technologies and some utopia after they call our numbers.
[1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:18.820]  I come in here on the message board, let me find it.
[1:43:18.820 --> 1:43:21.700]  It was in my, one of these multiple stacks.
[1:43:21.700 --> 1:43:22.980]  I want to read it and we'll go to your calls.
[1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:26.180]  I think I'm going to push back that vaccine guest a little bit,
[1:43:26.180 --> 1:43:27.140]  but that's so important.
[1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:29.780]  We've got to cover that in depth at least once a week.
[1:43:29.780 --> 1:43:30.980]  There's been a lot of new developments.
[1:43:33.540 --> 1:43:34.740]  Where was that comment?
[1:43:34.740 --> 1:43:37.060]  I wanted to, I wanted to read it.
[1:43:37.860 --> 1:43:40.100]  I've got to find the page that the comment is on.
[1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:48.740]  Oh, I'll just, oh, here it is.
[1:43:48.740 --> 1:43:49.220]  I found it.
[1:43:49.940 --> 1:43:50.260]  Okay.
[1:43:50.260 --> 1:43:51.860]  Now, now, now, now this is standard.
[1:43:51.860 --> 1:43:54.740]  This is what I get from university professors
[1:43:54.740 --> 1:43:58.180]  and think tank operatives and people who've been led in
[1:43:58.180 --> 1:44:02.660]  on the fringes of the war planning against the species.
[1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:07.380]  They're altering the species against the, it's like a virus,
[1:44:07.380 --> 1:44:12.500]  a mental spiritual virus has been introduced by an outside entity.
[1:44:12.500 --> 1:44:14.020]  This is basically what Christianity is saying.
[1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:16.580]  Call it what you want.
[1:44:16.580 --> 1:44:19.060]  It's going on and it is spiritual.
[1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:23.620]  It transcends, it's outside of even human activity.
[1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:26.500]  It manifests and everyone recognizes this at their core.
[1:44:28.180 --> 1:44:31.060]  Like a virus has been introduced that is designed to destroy us,
[1:44:32.180 --> 1:44:34.980]  that is designed to accelerate our destruction,
[1:44:34.980 --> 1:44:38.020]  that is designed to unleash the worst in us.
[1:44:41.700 --> 1:44:45.060]  And I wanted to read you this quote.
[1:44:47.700 --> 1:44:49.380]  The New World Order sounds great.
[1:44:49.380 --> 1:44:49.940]  Think about it.
[1:44:52.260 --> 1:44:54.340]  This is what Philip James Bagg said.
[1:44:54.900 --> 1:44:56.020]  The New Order sounds great.
[1:44:56.020 --> 1:44:56.580]  Think about it.
[1:44:57.300 --> 1:45:01.620]  These people are much smarter than us.
[1:45:01.620 --> 1:45:04.420]  They need us to perform a function that our tiny minds
[1:45:04.420 --> 1:45:05.220]  cannot comprehend.
[1:45:06.260 --> 1:45:09.140]  Once this has been put into effect for a couple of generations,
[1:45:09.140 --> 1:45:11.940]  it will be a beautiful system that will have a great function in the universe.
[1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:16.100]  Now think of the jealousness, think of the enviousness,
[1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:19.220]  the covetousness, the greediness of saying,
[1:45:19.220 --> 1:45:21.060]  yeah, we're going to exterminate the majority of you
[1:45:21.060 --> 1:45:22.340]  and bring in a world turning to do it.
[1:45:22.340 --> 1:45:23.860]  And we're going to control the future,
[1:45:23.860 --> 1:45:25.940]  but it's because we're going to build something beautiful in the future.
[1:45:26.740 --> 1:45:29.140]  But all you build is death and destruction now.
[1:45:29.140 --> 1:45:31.700]  That's a sick pipe dream, a delusion.
[1:45:31.700 --> 1:45:35.060]  You realize the criminology of psychopaths torturing and killing people
[1:45:35.060 --> 1:45:36.580]  and they go, it's beautiful, it's beautiful.
[1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:40.820]  To them, dead dogs covered with maggots are beautiful.
[1:45:43.620 --> 1:45:46.580]  See, it's a spiritual thing.
[1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:50.660]  To a person who loves life and beauty and green fields
[1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:53.460]  and the stars and life and everything good,
[1:45:53.460 --> 1:45:54.900]  it's horrible and stinks.
[1:45:54.900 --> 1:45:56.420]  To them, it smells good.
[1:45:56.420 --> 1:45:57.780]  They have a taste for it.
[1:45:57.780 --> 1:46:01.860]  And that's what they always say.
[1:46:01.860 --> 1:46:07.380]  They always say, well, Alex, the leader in power,
[1:46:07.380 --> 1:46:10.420]  does it that show that survival of the fittest evolution,
[1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:12.020]  they deserve to be in power?
[1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:14.180]  They deserve to dominate.
[1:46:14.180 --> 1:46:15.780]  It's their rightful place to direct us
[1:46:15.780 --> 1:46:18.020]  because they cared enough to get into power and control.
[1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:19.700]  If they have the grand vision,
[1:46:19.700 --> 1:46:21.140]  well, look at the public, a bunch of idiots.
[1:46:21.780 --> 1:46:23.780]  Well, yes, and the elite tries to intensify that
[1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:28.420]  and make that worse instead of uplifting because the elite
[1:46:28.420 --> 1:46:29.860]  thinks they're all individuals,
[1:46:29.860 --> 1:46:31.780]  doesn't know they're all interconnected everybody else.
[1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:36.580]  And they believe in total selfishness and do as thou will.
[1:46:37.540 --> 1:46:39.540]  So they want the final ultimate revolution
[1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:42.500]  of creating a world police state, exterminating the majority of us,
[1:46:42.500 --> 1:46:43.860]  and then moving on to the stars.
[1:46:44.820 --> 1:46:46.020]  Talk about megalomania.
[1:46:50.420 --> 1:46:52.180]  I mean, if you read what Kerr as well says,
[1:46:52.180 --> 1:46:53.460]  if you read what Bill Joyce says,
[1:46:53.460 --> 1:46:55.220]  have you read what people in the elite say,
[1:46:55.220 --> 1:46:57.780]  have you read the Pentagon war plans,
[1:46:57.780 --> 1:46:59.140]  the futurist Pentagon planners,
[1:46:59.140 --> 1:47:00.820]  what they say they're going to build, this is it.
[1:47:07.700 --> 1:47:10.740]  And to say that because they're dominant
[1:47:10.740 --> 1:47:12.180]  and have taken over a society,
[1:47:14.980 --> 1:47:16.660]  that that gives them a right to rule.
[1:47:16.660 --> 1:47:20.100]  Well, I mean, again, the analogy, the parallel is cancer.
[1:47:20.100 --> 1:47:22.740]  You have a cancer and it races through the body,
[1:47:22.740 --> 1:47:25.220]  it spreads, it replicates, it takes over the organs,
[1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:29.540]  and it breaks the function of the group organism.
[1:47:30.900 --> 1:47:34.420]  And then the main organism stops to function
[1:47:34.420 --> 1:47:37.700]  and the tissues or the different colony groups
[1:47:37.700 --> 1:47:40.820]  working in conjunction fail and the organism,
[1:47:40.820 --> 1:47:51.380]  the organism, the group organism, the communal colony, that's what you are, dies.
[1:47:54.260 --> 1:47:58.980]  But if the cancer had a intelligence, if it was aware,
[1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:00.820]  it would be delusional.
[1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:04.100]  It would see the tissue it was invading as an enemy
[1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:06.740]  and think, look at me, I'm taking over, I'm running everything,
[1:48:06.740 --> 1:48:10.420]  I'm dominant, survival of the fittest, I'm the best, I'm wonderful,
[1:48:10.420 --> 1:48:11.940]  I'm great, I'm good.
[1:48:12.740 --> 1:48:15.060]  And the elites have really answered these statements before and said,
[1:48:15.060 --> 1:48:16.820]  well, no, we're going to control that.
[1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:20.740]  And sure, we do spread like a cancer,
[1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:23.700]  but that's only to destroy the original body,
[1:48:23.700 --> 1:48:24.980]  we're going to forge something new.
[1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:36.020]  I mean, this is really a dark vision, a dark dream,
[1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:43.620]  a nightmarish, hellish entity, an expression of the group consciousness,
[1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:46.100]  whatever you want to call it, it isn't good.
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:55.220]  It brings doom, doom, doom.
[1:49:00.420 --> 1:49:04.340]  Do you know what doom is, the word doom?
[1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:07.540]  Doom, let me get the definition of doom.
[1:49:08.660 --> 1:49:10.180]  Let's go to Google.
[1:49:13.140 --> 1:49:14.740]  Let me type in doom.
[1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:24.260]  Let me do definition or I'll get a name, definition of doom.
[1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:29.700]  Let me give you the definition of doom.
[1:49:29.700 --> 1:49:37.620]  Inevitable destruction or ruin, fate, especially a tragic one or ruinous one,
[1:49:37.620 --> 1:49:42.660]  a decision or judgment, especially an official condemnation to a severe penalty,
[1:49:42.660 --> 1:49:49.220]  judgment day, a statute or ordinance, you kill 50 million of your own babies,
[1:49:49.220 --> 1:49:55.220]  you can rationalize it any way you want, death has been released, a statue or ordinance.
[1:49:55.220 --> 1:50:00.660]  See, we have broken the ordinance, especially one in force in Anglo-Saxon, England,
[1:50:00.660 --> 1:50:10.100]  the condemnation to ruination or death, to destined to an unhappy end.
[1:50:14.580 --> 1:50:18.740]  An unpleasant or disastrous destiny, everyone was aware of the approaching doom
[1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:20.340]  but was helpless to avoid it.
[1:50:20.340 --> 1:50:22.740]  That's unfortunate, but it isn't the end of the world.
[1:50:22.740 --> 1:50:29.540]  Or is it an event or a course of events that will inevitably happen in the future,
[1:50:30.260 --> 1:50:34.420]  decree or designate beforehand, she was destined to become
[1:50:37.780 --> 1:50:44.340]  pronounced a sentence in a court of law, he was condemned to 10 years in prison, he was doomed.
[1:50:44.340 --> 1:50:56.420]  The collection of rules imposed by authority, civilizations, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.
[1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:03.220]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes the
[1:51:03.220 --> 1:51:09.220]  long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely

[1:52:58.180 --> 1:53:03.700]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot. In Downey, California, it's illegal

[1:53:08.500 --> 1:53:14.020]  is for sale. These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.

[1:53:57.460 --> 1:54:06.740]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[1:54:07.300 --> 1:54:13.700]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Okay, let's roll through your calls a little bit faster
[1:54:13.700 --> 1:54:22.180]  here. Who's up next, John? I got so many. Elliott in Ohio, then Robert and many others.
[1:54:22.180 --> 1:54:29.220]  Go ahead, you're on the air. Yeah, Alex, my first point is I think we all,
[1:54:29.220 --> 1:54:34.180]  everyone who's listening, we all need to email and call our congressmen, our senators. We need to
[1:54:34.180 --> 1:54:39.380]  give them this information of how Georgia attacked Russia first, not the other way around. We really
[1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:43.220]  need to push this, because now I'm a little bit worried, just like you, Alex, because I know what
[1:54:43.220 --> 1:54:48.180]  this would lead to. It's kind of scary. It's not what I want to see, and I don't think it's what
[1:54:48.180 --> 1:54:53.940]  everyone else in America wants to see, nuclear fallout and all that. The other point is it's
[1:54:53.940 --> 1:54:58.100]  kind of more direct to you, actually, Alex. Now, I've been listening to your show for about a year
[1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:04.180]  and a half now. Yeah, I totally agree with you. I've read all the documents too about how the
[1:55:04.180 --> 1:55:12.660]  New World Order, all these elitists are cultists. Yeah, they do tend to go towards Crowley's
[1:55:12.660 --> 1:55:19.060]  philosophy. Now, I've come across, you know, many people in Cincinnati, because there is a huge
[1:55:19.060 --> 1:55:24.500]  pagan community in Cincinnati, Ohio, and they are, they know, they know about all this, Alex,
[1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:28.660]  and they're not, and they're not, you know, like selfish people. I mean, of course, that
[1:55:28.660 --> 1:55:34.500]  philosophy will drive some to a selfish nature. Well, that's low-level people, that's low-level
[1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:39.380]  people, and they'll quote, never get the power. So, see, they're seen as idiots and a joke.
[1:55:39.380 --> 1:55:45.700]  In fact, Anton Leves said that. Yeah, yeah. Do they say, oh, we don't, we're not into violence,
[1:55:45.700 --> 1:55:50.740]  we're not into sacrifice, we're not into all this. Oh, we're good, it's all lies. And then,
[1:55:50.740 --> 1:55:54.420]  meanwhile, their, their head Satanists laugh at them and say, look at those idiots. I mean,
[1:55:54.420 --> 1:56:00.180]  it's just delusional. They are attracted to that, and they can't be honest with themselves about
[1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:06.340]  that. Let's see, that's the thing. The community that come across are not led by anyone. They're
[1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:11.300]  all, they're all, in a sense, philosophical individuals. Yeah, they're all on their,
[1:56:11.300 --> 1:56:16.100]  well, they're all on their own power trip, and, you know, they, they can all make up and deceive
[1:56:16.100 --> 1:56:20.180]  themselves and say, we're not part of anything evil, we're actually fighting corruption and
[1:56:20.180 --> 1:56:26.420]  control, you know, that all Satanists are diverse. No, it's, it's, it's, it's not diverse.
[1:56:27.300 --> 1:56:32.340]  But they're not Satanists, that's the thing. The Satanists go towards Anton Leves, the
[1:56:32.340 --> 1:56:37.780]  community. I've come across for either Wiccans, which is the right impact where you, you know,
[1:56:37.780 --> 1:56:42.740]  you have all the deities, like, you know, Nuit, Hadid, and, you know, all those entities, and then
[1:56:42.740 --> 1:56:48.420]  you have the, uh, Thelomites, Prolians, who are all, uh, we are all gods of our own universes.
[1:56:49.060 --> 1:56:53.460]  And yes, that does tend to breed a selfish nature with, uh, do with that. Well, it should be the
[1:56:53.460 --> 1:56:58.340]  whole, it's a bunch of people on mindless power trips, and I appreciate your call. Let me tell
[1:56:58.340 --> 1:57:03.620]  you something. You start loving other people and you start wanting to sacrifice yourself,
[1:57:03.620 --> 1:57:08.020]  you're going to get real power. You have no idea, you understand and believe me,
[1:57:08.020 --> 1:57:13.700]  once you then are actually good and, and, and actually are a powerful person, you are, uh,
[1:57:13.700 --> 1:57:18.660]  humbled. You are humbled by the way your intellect opens up, the way you understand things.
[1:57:18.660 --> 1:57:24.900]  These stupid little occultists are weak. I've talked to them. They get into Dungeons and Dragons,
[1:57:24.900 --> 1:57:28.740]  they get into mythological imaginary worlds, they sit in little dirty apartments,
[1:57:28.740 --> 1:57:34.660]  imagining they have all this power. Okay, they play in imaginary worlds. The higher level,
[1:57:34.660 --> 1:57:39.540]  the globalist do have power and they're totally wicked and dark. People say, well, the Druids,
[1:57:39.540 --> 1:57:43.060]  you know, they were, they were into human sacrifice control. Every culture did this,
[1:57:43.060 --> 1:57:47.380]  humans do the same thing, whether it's the Aztecs or the Druids or the Babylonians,
[1:57:47.380 --> 1:57:53.540]  it doesn't matter what group it is. This ends up happening. This ends up manifesting.
[1:57:53.540 --> 1:57:58.100]  Okay, you can call it whatever you want. It is a human manifestation. It happens
[1:57:59.860 --> 1:58:07.620]  and cultures that get into this fall apart. Cultures that, and every culture had a form
[1:58:07.620 --> 1:58:11.860]  of human sacrifice, like the Vikings, the Norse, the Russians, the Russian just means the red,
[1:58:11.860 --> 1:58:16.020]  the Northerners, you know, they would burn their wives when they would die. They'd be thrown on
[1:58:16.020 --> 1:58:24.580]  the fire. It is a sick thing that humans do and it needs to stop. We are predators and we preditate.
[1:58:26.740 --> 1:58:34.900]  That's a word. We engage in predatory activity against our own species. Okay, period. We'll
[1:58:34.900 --> 1:58:50.020]  right back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today. May I have everybody's attention,
[1:58:50.020 --> 1:58:56.580]  please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet,
[1:58:56.580 --> 1:58:59.860]  sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order? How do the American people know
[1:58:59.860 --> 1:59:04.820]  that 9-11 was a stage, was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission
[1:59:04.820 --> 1:59:12.260]  to see far? The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[1:59:12.260 --> 1:59:18.180]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global
[1:59:18.180 --> 1:59:29.060]  awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you? If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:59:29.060 --> 1:59:40.340]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself. All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.

[1:59:46.020 --> 1:59:55.700]  to take the revolution to the next level. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[1:59:55.700 --> 2:00:10.020]  network. Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:10.660 --> 2:00:18.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:18.980 --> 2:00:25.060]  Plenty makes monsters. Adversity makes men.
[2:00:28.020 --> 2:00:34.740]  Humans are meant to be tested. And you'll be tested nowhere in life. Like you will be if you
[2:00:34.740 --> 2:00:41.060]  decide to take the hard choices to be strong and to not be part of the world. In the world,
[2:00:41.060 --> 2:00:44.820]  but not part of it. Not worshiping all its crud. Not worshiping yourself.
[2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:51.060]  Then you will truly become what you were made to be a creator.
[2:00:52.340 --> 2:00:56.900]  An entity made in the image of the creator of the universe. And the enemy hates that.
[2:00:57.460 --> 2:01:03.140]  Lucifer and all of his pimps and pumps are not true creators. They are counterfeiters.
[2:01:03.140 --> 2:01:10.420]  They are systems that take over existing systems and mutate them. They're viruses. They're cancer.
[2:01:10.420 --> 2:01:15.300]  All right. Let's go back to the calls here. And we've got a guest coming up.
[2:01:18.260 --> 2:01:22.180]  I guess, is Brent in Florida next? Brent, you're on the air.
[2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:26.820]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing today? Good, my friend.
[2:01:26.820 --> 2:01:31.620]  I'm greetings from the Spook Retirement Capital of the USA, Melbourne, Florida.
[2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:39.140]  I just wanted to basically call and give you a little boost here. It sounds like you're a
[2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:43.460]  little down depressed and bummed out. I want you to know to hold the line.
[2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:50.980]  A lot of us all out here depend upon you for what's going on and information.
[2:01:51.700 --> 2:01:57.380]  You sounded a little bit disheartened. I know the information out there is just mind boggling.
[2:01:57.380 --> 2:02:02.020]  Hold the line, Alex. Well, it's mind boggling to know that they're really going to do it.
[2:02:02.020 --> 2:02:05.380]  If it's this year, next year, then one after that, I don't know. But the elite
[2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:11.940]  are bold. I mean, they are out of control. Doing that 9-11 stunt shows that they are really bold
[2:02:11.940 --> 2:02:16.980]  and they could do anything. I don't mean that stage Cold War of 20 years ago.
[2:02:16.980 --> 2:02:22.740]  I mean, they're really heating things up right now. I agree, Alex, but hold the line. A lot of us
[2:02:22.740 --> 2:02:32.420]  look to you for guidance, support, information worldwide. Hold the line, Alex. Listen, I am.
[2:02:32.420 --> 2:02:36.660]  I'm more fired up than ever. I sometimes just get taken aback and I have to take a deep breath
[2:02:36.660 --> 2:02:40.420]  because I start thinking about my children. I mean, that's really what happens. I just keep
[2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:45.620]  imaging them, their innocence, their goodness, their decency, what the world should be, and it
[2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:51.860]  just doesn't make me angry anymore. It makes me sick in my stomach. I feel it. It's disheartening.
[2:02:52.660 --> 2:02:58.500]  I lose sleep over it. Everything. I've been doing this for 20 years, Alex, along with you,
[2:02:58.500 --> 2:03:04.340]  not to the level that you have, but I'll tell you one thing, man. You are one of the strongest rocks
[2:03:04.340 --> 2:03:11.380]  we have out there. God bless Jesse Ventura, but I'll tell you one thing. He needs to come back
[2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:16.020]  and stay here in the United States. We need leaders like he. Well, he told me privately,
[2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:20.900]  he told me privately that the American people are just too wicked and weak, and I think he's
[2:03:20.900 --> 2:03:26.420]  given up, but he's older than I am, and he's evacuating the country. He's going to drop by in
[2:03:26.420 --> 2:03:30.100]  Austin for a little event we're having, and then he's literally going to cross the border and leave,
[2:03:31.140 --> 2:03:38.820]  but that's his deal. Once we have that spirit of giving up, though, we will lose.
[2:03:39.540 --> 2:03:44.340]  I fully agree, Alex, but hold the line. Keep everybody supported. Keep everybody boosted.
[2:03:44.340 --> 2:03:50.100]  I'm going to let you go because I got kids to feed and a wife to love, but you have a lot of
[2:03:50.100 --> 2:03:56.340]  support down here in Florida. A lot of people that are too afraid to even call in or let anybody
[2:03:56.340 --> 2:04:01.860]  know. Hold the line, Alex. Well, thanks, my friend. You know, having that police chief in
[2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:05.620]  there, I was looking into his eyes and talking to him. That guy knows what's going on, and he's
[2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:09.780]  a little freaked out about it, and so he thinks he can just make everything nice, and that somehow
[2:04:09.780 --> 2:04:13.700]  we're all, it's going to be okay. It isn't going to be okay when the White House puts out memos
[2:04:13.700 --> 2:04:18.660]  saying sexually torture children. It's not all right. It's over. When you got 50 million
[2:04:18.660 --> 2:04:22.980]  aborted babies, you are an evil country, and you're right. We need to repent. We need to get
[2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:27.380]  out of this evil. We need to pull back now. Instead, we got a bunch of smiley-faced devils,
[2:04:27.380 --> 2:04:31.300]  like Condoleezza Rice and George Bush, and Barack Obama and the rest of them. I mean,
[2:04:31.300 --> 2:04:35.300]  Barack Obama calling for all sorts of stuff against Russia. They're just a pack of crooks,
[2:04:36.340 --> 2:04:41.060]  and Russia is probably no better, folks. It's just that they're not as powerful as this branch,
[2:04:41.060 --> 2:04:47.380]  and so they're not the aggressor. We're going to come back, get into serious public service
[2:04:47.380 --> 2:04:51.700]  announcement. This is information that is life and death, not just to you, but to others around
[2:04:51.700 --> 2:05:00.820]  you. I got a mission for you. Stay with us. Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces
[2:05:00.820 --> 2:05:05.460]  of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there
[2:05:05.460 --> 2:05:10.100]  is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential
[2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:14.660]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master
[2:05:14.660 --> 2:05:19.380]  plan. We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:07:58.180 --> 2:08:04.340]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:26.740]  a war on for your mind. We do need to call Congress, call our governors, call the media,
[2:08:26.740 --> 2:08:29.620]  say we don't want to encircle Russia, we don't want to start a war with them.
[2:08:29.620 --> 2:08:37.780]  We don't want the five carrier task force groups to attack Iran in October or maybe even earlier.
[2:08:39.220 --> 2:08:43.220]  We just want the new order to back off, and that at least when you call the politicians in
[2:08:43.220 --> 2:08:45.860]  Congress, let them know that we understand they're under continuity of government,
[2:08:45.860 --> 2:08:51.380]  that they can't even see PD-51, that they're just puppets now, but tell them to speak out about
[2:08:51.380 --> 2:08:57.300]  it. Tell them we understand why they're hostages. Okay, there's a lot of things we can do though,
[2:08:57.300 --> 2:09:03.540]  and that's educate our police and military locally, educate the media locally, all of you become vocal
[2:09:03.540 --> 2:09:08.180]  about whatever issue you think's most important, but I'll tell you one area we can expose right now.
[2:09:10.820 --> 2:09:14.660]  And that's the eugenics programs being carried on against everyone in the Western world.
[2:09:16.580 --> 2:09:20.100]  The hormones that they've caught in almost every major vaccine line in Europe,
[2:09:20.100 --> 2:09:28.420]  Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the U.S. with hormones tied to the pathogen, whatever the
[2:09:28.420 --> 2:09:32.340]  immunity is to be developed for, depending on the shot, that it sterilizes the women.
[2:09:33.700 --> 2:09:37.780]  The cancer viruses that have been found in every major vaccine line that aren't even associated
[2:09:37.780 --> 2:09:42.580]  with the manufacture of the vaccine, meaning they were added. The fact that we've gone from
[2:09:42.580 --> 2:09:48.500]  one in 33 having cancer decades ago to one in three now. The fact that sodium fluoride,
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:54.740]  we've had, you know, top scientists on, we've had current, you know, FDA people on and EPA people
[2:09:54.740 --> 2:09:58.340]  on admitting it and saying the higher ups won't let them stop it. The federal mandating of sodium
[2:09:58.340 --> 2:10:02.660]  fluoride that attacks every gland in the body calcifies the bones, massively increases cancer.
[2:10:02.660 --> 2:10:08.980]  It's like fluoridation cancer risk. It'll give you, in boys, it doubles more than doubles,
[2:10:08.980 --> 2:10:15.060]  depending on the study, doubles as the average bone cancer. That's just one of hundreds of
[2:10:15.060 --> 2:10:19.140]  wonderful cancers it gives you. I mean, forget dumbing you down and giving you an average,
[2:10:19.140 --> 2:10:23.060]  a 20 point IQ reduction. That's what most of the studies say. Some say more, some say less.
[2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:26.660]  Go read it. Governments, foreign governments, our government, studies in the 20s,
[2:10:27.620 --> 2:10:32.580]  studies this year, studies last year. I mean, we could at least stop drinking poison water
[2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:39.140]  and stop taking vaccines. Now, starting a year ago and then throughout that time,
[2:10:39.140 --> 2:10:45.060]  about six months ago, last time with our guest, we covered the fact that the insert with the
[2:10:45.620 --> 2:10:52.740]  Gardasil HPV live cancer virus vaccine, that their own insert with the drug said that if you
[2:10:52.740 --> 2:10:57.300]  already have the virus, which about half the population does, it gives you a 45% chance of that
[2:10:57.940 --> 2:11:05.700]  actually giving you cancer. It also only protects you from a few of the strains of hundreds and
[2:11:05.700 --> 2:11:09.780]  hundreds. And then they say they're not even sure it does protect you from it. But then they
[2:11:09.780 --> 2:11:13.860]  advertise it like it will keep you from ever getting cancer or basically any types of way
[2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:20.100]  the idiot public picks it up, the dumb down public. Now, when they did trials a couple years ago,
[2:11:21.460 --> 2:11:24.500]  it killed a bunch of the people that took it and caused autoimmune diseases
[2:11:25.060 --> 2:11:29.780]  and in all sorts of collapses, paralysis, we had guests in studio, what happened to,
[2:11:29.780 --> 2:11:34.180]  I mean, the list goes on and on and on and on and on. Now they're giving similar shots to the troops.
[2:11:34.180 --> 2:11:36.260]  It's killing them. The government won't even tell them what it is.
[2:11:39.140 --> 2:11:42.980]  And Barbara Lowe Fisher has probably done more than anybody in her organization,
[2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:47.780]  National Vaccine Information Center, to give you the facts. She won a big victory. We won
[2:11:47.780 --> 2:11:52.260]  a big victory earlier this year when, of course, what we already knew from hundreds of studies and
[2:11:52.260 --> 2:12:04.820]  research that sodium additives that the thimerosal, mercury additives, that the, that that there were
[2:12:04.820 --> 2:12:12.340]  major connections and improve causal proof with autism going from one in 25,000 two decades ago
[2:12:12.340 --> 2:12:18.980]  to one in, in what, 168. I'm going from memory here. She can correct me to now they're saying
[2:12:18.980 --> 2:12:24.260]  one in 85 and don't say it's overreporting. There's autistic children everywhere. I wouldn't
[2:12:24.260 --> 2:12:28.100]  got a haircut the other day and there were two autistic children, separate mothers, one a boy,
[2:12:28.100 --> 2:12:32.980]  one a girl in there freaking out. That didn't fake like Michael Savage says.
[2:12:35.380 --> 2:12:39.220]  Bottom line, they're now lying and saying you have to take vaccines. It's the law. They're now
[2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:44.740]  accelerating that hoax. We're entering into the new school year here. Images of students crying,
[2:12:44.740 --> 2:12:49.060]  lined up with dogs barking, getting shots in Maryland. I had the head state attorney on. He
[2:12:49.060 --> 2:12:52.020]  admitted there's no law to take it, but we basically tell them it is. And by the way,
[2:12:52.020 --> 2:12:58.580]  I don't vaccinate my own children. He said now we have scores of people dead. The government
[2:12:58.580 --> 2:13:06.740]  saying 9,000 plus have had bad adverse reactions, autoimmune disease, paralyzed. And remember about
[2:13:06.740 --> 2:13:12.500]  one out of 10 of old drugs gets an adverse reaction reported like penicillin. It's about one
[2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:18.100]  out of 40 for a new drug or quote, live cancer virus. You call that a drug. And so I wanted to
[2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:22.020]  give you some of that basic information sitting on the table because there are women everywhere
[2:13:22.020 --> 2:13:27.300]  and fathers everywhere watching TV. They're hearing it's the law in Texas to take the shot
[2:13:27.300 --> 2:13:30.980]  when it's not the law. He said it was one of the recommended vaccines and the school says it's
[2:13:30.980 --> 2:13:35.220]  policy to say you have to take it when they have a waiver. So more lies. They're not just giving
[2:13:35.220 --> 2:13:38.900]  you something deadly. They're lying. So hundreds of thousands of girls are getting this. They're
[2:13:38.900 --> 2:13:43.380]  dropping dead. Women are taking it. They're having miscarriages. The government's admitting all of
[2:13:43.380 --> 2:13:48.100]  this and they just say, well, that's acceptable. Let's go to our guests for the rest of the hour.
[2:13:48.100 --> 2:13:53.700]  We'll take calls at the bottom of the hour, Barbara Lowe Fisher. And she's with the vaccine,
[2:13:53.700 --> 2:14:02.820]  National Vaccine Information Center, NVIC.org, NVIC.org. This is life and death, ladies and
[2:14:02.820 --> 2:14:09.860]  gentlemen, because this is just one of the newest of the live cancer virus type vaccines that they're
[2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:15.700]  coming out with. Barbara, things are really getting bad. You tried to warn people a year ago. Now the
[2:14:15.700 --> 2:14:20.100]  death toll is mounting. And Merck, who brought us all these other deadly drugs, is moving forward.
[2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:26.820]  Right. We had pushed out our first press release in June of 2006, right before the CDC recommended
[2:14:26.820 --> 2:14:33.300]  that the HPV vaccine be targeted at all 11 to 12-year-old girls. And we warned that Merck had
[2:14:33.300 --> 2:14:38.340]  only studied it, and fewer than 1,200 girls under age of 16, that they had used the phony
[2:14:38.340 --> 2:14:43.380]  placebo in the clinical trials. That is, they put aluminum in the placebo in those trials,
[2:14:43.380 --> 2:14:47.300]  and they didn't tell anybody how. They wouldn't tell us how much aluminum they had put in the
[2:14:47.300 --> 2:14:54.100]  placebo. Aluminum on its own can cause nerve cell death. It can cause inflammation in the body.
[2:14:54.100 --> 2:14:59.060]  So those trials, we don't really know the reactivity. Are you on a Vonage phone?
[2:15:01.300 --> 2:15:07.300]  I'm on a, I'm actually on, in Chicago. I'm not actually in Vienna. I'm on a polycom phone. Can
[2:15:07.300 --> 2:15:11.700]  you not hear me well? No, every half of what you're saying is being cut out. We're going to reconnect
[2:15:11.700 --> 2:15:15.300]  with you right now. We're going to reconnect with you right now. Okay. And we'll go to cell phone
[2:15:15.300 --> 2:15:20.180]  back up if we can. I do a five minute intro and the phone's not working. This is life and death
[2:15:20.180 --> 2:15:25.700]  information, ladies and gentlemen. And she's right. She's been warning people for close to two years.
[2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:30.900]  We got on this about a year and a half ago. And we said, okay, they've got limited studies
[2:15:30.900 --> 2:15:37.780]  and out of a thousand plus people that took it in the, in the study, what three of them died.
[2:15:37.780 --> 2:15:41.780]  I mean, you know, you got what 1600 in the first study, we'll get the, that's from memory, we'll
[2:15:41.780 --> 2:15:48.420]  get the numbers from her and three die. And that's with improper reporting when they always
[2:15:48.420 --> 2:15:52.820]  under report that because with a new drug, the doctors don't know why you're dying. Your child
[2:15:52.820 --> 2:15:57.140]  gets a shot and they're having a convulsion five hours later. And then the doctors are, you know,
[2:15:57.140 --> 2:16:00.900]  basically in the system where generally you take them back to the doctor that gave the shot, they
[2:16:00.900 --> 2:16:04.500]  don't want to get sued for liability. They say, Oh, I don't know why your, your daughter had this.
[2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:08.100]  Did you beat her up? Doot, doot, doot, doot, doot, cop show up. Did you beat your daughter?
[2:16:08.100 --> 2:16:12.660]  We're going to go ahead and take her into custody. That's another scam. They, sudden infant death
[2:16:12.660 --> 2:16:16.980]  has been collated in a bunch of studies. You can pull it up to vaccines. The babies usually die
[2:16:16.980 --> 2:16:22.100]  the night of the shots. You get a cop visit and you go to prison for the government murdering
[2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:27.860]  your baby with their lies and fraud about shots. And I'm not joking. You know, you go ahead and
[2:16:27.860 --> 2:16:31.860]  laugh out there, cops and people that work in the system and social workers, go ahead. You
[2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:35.940]  got a happy 18 month old running around the house, go give them the shot. They're going to have that
[2:16:35.940 --> 2:16:39.300]  convulsion and you're going to be crying your guts out and you're going to be an Alex Jones
[2:16:39.300 --> 2:16:45.220]  listener from that time on, not a smirking, laughing person. I'm trying to save you and so
[2:16:45.220 --> 2:16:53.300]  is Barbara Lowe Fisher. Do we have her back? Calling her back right now? Okay. These internet
[2:16:53.300 --> 2:16:56.580]  phones are great. You know, they cut the phone company out of the money, which is fine with me,
[2:16:56.580 --> 2:17:01.380]  but they don't work half the time and they give us living, you know, what on the show?
[2:17:04.340 --> 2:17:08.900]  We'll get her back on. Now, she's going to give you the numbers. We can play the CNN clip.
[2:17:08.900 --> 2:17:11.860]  Cue that CNN up while you're getting her back on or we're going to play that later
[2:17:11.860 --> 2:17:17.860]  because I know you won't believe me. It's like, oh, more than 9,000 horrible reactions being
[2:17:17.860 --> 2:17:23.140]  paralyzed. Oh, you know, 20 something dead just in the latest round of shots. That's not counting
[2:17:23.140 --> 2:17:28.660]  all the miscarriages. Got these women thinking, oh, I'll take the shot, the hospital. Oh, you're
[2:17:28.660 --> 2:17:35.940]  about to have a baby. Oh, oh, you go in to see your, uh, your doctor a few months before you're
[2:17:35.940 --> 2:17:40.500]  having the baby and they say, oh, this, we have this new great shot. Oh, let me have that. You
[2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:47.780]  have a horrible induced abortion. And of course, the doctors don't even know that they're just
[2:17:47.780 --> 2:17:51.300]  following. Well, I'm a good doctor. I'm a good person. I'm not bad. Well, yeah. And you don't
[2:17:51.300 --> 2:17:55.780]  understand the eugenics agenda. Modern medical science is based on eugenics. That's why you
[2:17:55.780 --> 2:18:05.220]  don't give the Hippocratic oath anymore that we have her. Oh man. All right. Well, I just can't
[2:18:05.220 --> 2:18:12.420]  do the interview with that phone that way. So say la vie. Don't warn folks. Uh, it doesn't
[2:18:12.420 --> 2:18:16.740]  matter. Just laugh at me. You know what? I'm Russia attacked Georgia. How's that sound?
[2:18:16.740 --> 2:18:20.260]  You know, let's just lie and say that and go with the official story. Glenn Beck's good.
[2:18:20.260 --> 2:18:25.380]  Rush Limbaugh's good. Uh, Barack Obama's good. There's no new world order. Even though they
[2:18:25.380 --> 2:18:29.940]  call for it every day on TV and the government won't hurt you and everything's fine. Roll your
[2:18:29.940 --> 2:18:35.380]  sleeves up. Okay. Let's go ahead and jam a call in here. Who's up next?
[2:18:37.940 --> 2:18:43.700]  Aaron in California, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, this is Aaron out here. Um,
[2:18:44.340 --> 2:18:48.420]  I talked to you of last Friday or so. Um, just wanted to call and say that, you know,
[2:18:48.420 --> 2:18:54.500]  your vaccine information is so important and actually in my own life, my little sister,
[2:18:54.500 --> 2:19:00.580]  who's only 11, actually got one of the three series of shots. She got six. She had a running
[2:19:00.580 --> 2:19:05.220]  nose within a week. My mom was flipping out on the doctor that they gave her that shot.
[2:19:05.220 --> 2:19:12.100]  And she didn't get the next two of the three and, uh, I've got another friend who had a little boy
[2:19:12.100 --> 2:19:17.780]  who got, he went into complete convulsions and was hospitalized after his, of course,
[2:19:17.780 --> 2:19:23.780]  just like you said, 18 months, 18 months shot, especially for those little boys. As you said,
[2:19:23.780 --> 2:19:28.980]  because they don't have the ability to excrete the mercury, you know, God made them with the
[2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:35.060]  ability to excrete the mercury. You know, for women, any pediatrician will tell you,
[2:19:35.060 --> 2:19:39.620]  any medical doctor will tell you, girls are tougher. Does it mean tougher at bench pressing?
[2:19:39.620 --> 2:19:45.300]  Women have to be tougher. Their whole genetic compliment, their whole makeup, women, it's
[2:19:45.300 --> 2:19:54.580]  in all mammals. Females are stronger because of the childbirth and they're just designed tougher.
[2:19:58.900 --> 2:20:04.020]  Jim Newcomer from Minus Resources, August 14th, 2008. Gold open today at 82420.

[2:20:09.780 --> 2:20:16.980]  quarter ounce. That's 84884, 41830 and 20915. The Chinese government has begun a campaign
[2:20:16.980 --> 2:20:20.900]  of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[2:20:20.900 --> 2:20:25.780]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing Yon Revolution. Communist
[2:20:25.780 --> 2:20:30.900]  party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon,
[2:20:30.900 --> 2:20:35.300]  causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S. housing market and throwing the economy into
[2:20:35.300 --> 2:20:39.220]  a recession. Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due
[2:20:39.220 --> 2:20:44.820]  to this threat. Economist Ambrose Evans Prichard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear

[2:20:58.820 --> 2:21:04.660]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[2:21:04.660 --> 2:21:10.740]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:21:10.740 --> 2:21:15.460]  that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman,
[2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:24.820]  EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows
[2:21:24.820 --> 2:21:29.860]  the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their

[2:24:31.460 --> 2:24:34.500]  Barbara Lois Fisher with us for the rest of the hour. I'll hold her a little bit over in the
[2:24:34.500 --> 2:24:38.820]  neck so she can get plenty of time to go over all this and take your calls. When her phone was
[2:24:38.820 --> 2:24:44.420]  cutting out, I went to the first caller, Aaron, in California. He talked about his little sister
[2:24:44.420 --> 2:24:50.020]  taking it and one shot and almost killing her, getting real sick. Then he talked about another
[2:24:50.020 --> 2:24:56.020]  person he knows in the family who, 18 months old, the baby boy takes the shot, goes into convulsions.
[2:24:56.580 --> 2:25:00.580]  They usually swat team you over that after they run their bio attack on you or their chemical
[2:25:00.580 --> 2:25:04.260]  attack and say you beat the child. They have all the studies. They know full well what it is.
[2:25:04.260 --> 2:25:08.180]  The cops don't. They're all compartmentalized. Going to Barbara Lois Fisher. This is a quick
[2:25:08.180 --> 2:25:13.140]  segment, long segment coming up. Yes, breakdown. You knew federal studies. They knew it was a bad
[2:25:13.140 --> 2:25:17.700]  drug. So they had Rick Perry claim it was mandatory to give it back, to give it liability protection.
[2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:22.820]  And now we see the scourge it's causing. Barbara, you're on the air.
[2:25:23.700 --> 2:25:29.620]  Yes, it's very, very sad. I mean, we warned them. We did three separate reports with our up on our
[2:25:29.620 --> 2:25:38.660]  website under the Gardasil. If you click on three separate reports of the vaccine reactions coming
[2:25:38.660 --> 2:25:45.060]  into the federal vaccine and event reporting system in early 2000. And by August, we knew that
[2:25:45.060 --> 2:25:53.060]  this vaccine was very dangerous. And now there are so many reports coming in, they comprise 20 to
[2:25:53.060 --> 2:25:58.900]  25% of all vaccine reaction reports coming into the federal vaccine reporting system are for
[2:25:58.900 --> 2:26:04.420]  Gardasil. And right now this is a recommended vaccine, but it's not mandated in the state.
[2:26:04.420 --> 2:26:11.060]  So you can only imagine if it comprises 20 to 25% of all reports on all vaccines coming in
[2:26:11.060 --> 2:26:17.220]  and it's a new vaccine, not mandated. We have got a problem. And what really upset me is in the last
[2:26:17.220 --> 2:26:23.460]  few weeks, the CDC and FDA have issued a denial. Basically, they've said, we've looked at it.
[2:26:23.460 --> 2:26:28.740]  You know, yes, there are reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Yes, there are reports of death
[2:26:28.740 --> 2:26:36.020]  and seizures and atypical collapse, et cetera. But none of this is due to the vaccine, the vaccine
[2:26:36.020 --> 2:26:43.780]  is safe. And I just think it's wrong when you have clearly a reactive product to not admit, at
[2:26:43.780 --> 2:26:49.540]  least warn people that if they're going to take it, they need to be prepared to look out for these
[2:26:49.540 --> 2:26:54.420]  reactions. Hey, the Army's giving them shots. The Army's giving shots to troops now and not even
[2:26:54.420 --> 2:26:58.900]  saying what they are and they're dropping dead en masse. Now, now the numbers, CNN reports,
[2:26:58.900 --> 2:27:04.980]  26,000 plus adverse reactions and 20-something deaths, but then there's separate reports of all
[2:27:04.980 --> 2:27:10.180]  these miscarriages. And we know with a new drug, it's one out of 40 gets reported, not one out of
[2:27:10.180 --> 2:27:15.620]  10. So what are we really talking about here? Well, here's the thing. Well, you know, even
[2:27:15.620 --> 2:27:22.100]  in the medical literature, it shows that less than 10 percent, perhaps less than one to four
[2:27:22.100 --> 2:27:27.620]  percent of all serious reactions that occur after vaccination are ever reported to the government.
[2:27:28.340 --> 2:27:33.380]  That means that you can multiply, you know, the numbers of reports. I mean, for example,
[2:27:33.380 --> 2:27:39.700]  if there's a thousand reports after a vaccination and it's only less than one percent,
[2:27:39.700 --> 2:27:44.260]  you're really talking about 100,000. Well, let me be clear. I've got people at grocery stores,
[2:27:44.260 --> 2:27:50.260]  at the mall, on the street, going, my daughter, my neighbor, women coming up with bandages on their
[2:27:50.260 --> 2:27:55.860]  arms and rotholes saying it almost killed me. I mean, it's like neither living dead in Austin
[2:27:55.860 --> 2:28:00.100]  as all these well-meaning people just inject, inject, inject. This is pandemic.
[2:28:00.100 --> 2:28:04.820]  Well, I think what's important to remember is that cervical cancer
[2:28:05.700 --> 2:28:12.580]  is less than one percent of all cancers that occur in this country.
[2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:19.620]  What only kills 9,000 a year, 9,000 a year. No, actually, it's about 3,000 a year,
[2:28:19.620 --> 2:28:24.340]  and there are about 11,000, I think, new cases. It depends upon what chart you're looking at.
[2:28:24.340 --> 2:28:27.300]  That must have seen a lying mainstream report. They were saying 9,000. But
[2:28:27.300 --> 2:28:32.500]  Well, you know, it's hard to, there's so many figures out there, but the point is that it's
[2:28:32.500 --> 2:28:35.780]  like number 14 on the list of cancers for women in this country.
[2:28:35.780 --> 2:28:40.900]  But, and let's be clear though, this doesn't even cover it. If you read what the drug company says,
[2:28:40.900 --> 2:28:44.900]  it says we don't even know if this protects you, but by the way, it gives you a 45% increase
[2:28:44.900 --> 2:28:50.100]  in the cancer if you already have the virus. Well, they only followed the girls under 16.
[2:28:50.100 --> 2:28:56.020]  They only followed them up for less than two years. They have no idea if giving a 11-year-old
[2:28:56.020 --> 2:29:02.580]  girl or a teenage girl this vaccine, it is going to actually prevent cervical cancer later in life.
[2:29:02.580 --> 2:29:07.300]  And, you know, those people who are sexually active, most people who are sexually active have
[2:29:07.300 --> 2:29:18.580]  had contact with the HPV virus. But 98%, I'm sorry, 92% of all women who have HPV infection
[2:29:18.580 --> 2:29:24.660]  clear it within two years without any residual effects. That means that you clear it naturally
[2:29:24.660 --> 2:29:29.140]  from your body. There is, you have permanent antibody and you don't, you don't.
[2:29:29.140 --> 2:29:35.940]  Listen, listen, 18% of children have a similar wart on their skin and they get rid of it.
[2:29:35.940 --> 2:29:42.580]  18% of the American children out there have a similar viral infection that's non-sexual
[2:29:42.580 --> 2:29:46.740]  in the same family. Folks, it's complete bull. Stay there. We're going to continue
[2:29:46.740 --> 2:29:51.780]  to break this down with Barbara Lowe Fisher. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.

[2:29:58.980 --> 2:30:06.980]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:30:06.980 --> 2:30:13.220]  world government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Both their objective being world domination.
[2:30:13.780 --> 2:30:19.860]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:30:19.860 --> 2:30:24.340]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:30:27.300 --> 2:30:32.740]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:30:32.740 --> 2:30:36.580]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:30:36.580 --> 2:30:40.340]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[2:30:40.340 --> 2:30:43.700]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[2:33:09.220 --> 2:33:20.500]  Now we're not just giving you this information. A lot of women out there listening know we tell
[2:33:20.500 --> 2:33:24.740]  the truth. They've checked out the documents. They've gone to the incredible research at
[2:33:25.780 --> 2:33:32.500]  NVIC.org. The Barbara Lowe Fisher just a hero. She's undoubtedly with her work
[2:33:32.500 --> 2:33:37.700]  saved conservatively hundreds of thousands from brain damage, autism, autoimmune diseases and
[2:33:37.700 --> 2:33:42.340]  death that the bio weapons and chemical weapons are putting in the vaccines and I have the government
[2:33:42.340 --> 2:33:46.820]  documents that created HIV all of it folks. She just covers the facts and the documents of what
[2:33:46.820 --> 2:33:51.860]  the vaccines are doing. We have medical doctors on every week to tell you that it's a program
[2:33:51.860 --> 2:33:56.340]  in mainstream news in Africa and Asia. They all know it. The documents have been declassified.
[2:33:56.340 --> 2:34:02.740]  It is so evil that people can't believe it. Now we told you this would kill you. We told you
[2:34:02.740 --> 2:34:06.100]  would cause autoimmune problems. We're not even getting into all the other vaccines.
[2:34:06.100 --> 2:34:14.660]  The point here is you better tell your sister or your nieces or your grandmother or your
[2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:21.460]  granddaughters. You better warn the women in your life. You better warn your neighbors folks.
[2:34:21.460 --> 2:34:24.420]  You better just say, Hey, I know you've got daughters. I don't want to get in your business,
[2:34:24.420 --> 2:34:27.940]  but I know some people that took this and got sick or I've heard about it.
[2:34:27.940 --> 2:34:32.020]  You know, here's some print ops from this site with all these documents. You might,
[2:34:32.020 --> 2:34:36.900]  I mean, you know, humans are supposed to warn each other, but we all just watch TV and watch
[2:34:36.900 --> 2:34:41.460]  the Olympics and don't interface with anybody. We've got to get out. We've got to interface
[2:34:41.460 --> 2:34:45.060]  with people. We've got to do it. Going back to Barbara Lowe Fisher. Barbara, continue.
[2:34:45.940 --> 2:34:51.940]  Yes, it's real. I agree with you, Alex. I think word of mouth is, is the best form of advertising
[2:34:51.940 --> 2:34:57.940]  when something is wrong with a product. And, uh, you know, this information, as you said,
[2:34:57.940 --> 2:35:03.380]  has been documented. We have the, the documents on our website. We have, you could all you have
[2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:08.580]  to do is look at the vaccine product manufacturer insert to see the reports that have been reported
[2:35:08.580 --> 2:35:13.540]  or go on our website and search the government vaccine average event reporting system database.
[2:35:13.540 --> 2:35:19.140]  We have a way for you to go on and actually search that database to look at what the reports are
[2:35:19.140 --> 2:35:24.740]  that people are filing on this vaccine and on all the vaccine. So it's, it's, it's something
[2:35:24.740 --> 2:35:30.420]  that it's serious business. Before you go and get this vaccine or any vaccine, you've got to know
[2:35:30.420 --> 2:35:34.660]  what it is you're lining up for and rolling up your sleeve for or presenting your child with
[2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:42.500]  pediatrician for. Um, this vaccine, uh, contains, as I said, aluminum, uh, aluminum can cause
[2:35:42.500 --> 2:35:48.660]  inflammation in the body on its own, not just in a vaccine, but on its own. Um, it can, it can,
[2:35:48.660 --> 2:35:57.140]  it's a yeast, uh, it has a yeast protein in there. Um, they, the, the vaccine, um, is, as you said,
[2:35:57.140 --> 2:36:02.580]  not necessary, particularly for people, for women who get regular pap smears. You know,
[2:36:02.580 --> 2:36:10.180]  the majority is, uh, 98% of all cervical cancer can be prevented if women get routine pap smears.
[2:36:10.180 --> 2:36:15.060]  To be correct, identify the cervical, the lesions, the cervical lesion, uh, changes.
[2:36:15.060 --> 2:36:21.060]  If you have chronic HPV infection, a very tiny minority of women go on to have chronic HPV
[2:36:21.060 --> 2:36:25.620]  infection that they don't eliminate, you know, eliminate from the body naturally. What are the
[2:36:25.620 --> 2:36:30.580]  high risk factors for chronic HPV infections? We have these older drug addicts who are totally
[2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:35.860]  burned out and have, uh, depleted immune systems. They're poor. They're not getting medical checkups.
[2:36:35.860 --> 2:36:39.780]  Now they think they're going to take this shot and be safe and then they won't get a checkup
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:44.420]  and they admit the vaccine doesn't even protect you. Yes. And the high risk factors for chronic
[2:36:44.420 --> 2:36:53.860]  HPV infection are co-infection with HIV, Chlamydia, uh, and herpes viruses. If you are a long-term
[2:36:53.860 --> 2:37:00.260]  smoker, if you have had long-term oral contraceptive use, if you've had many, given birth to many,
[2:37:00.260 --> 2:37:07.380]  many children, these are high risk factors. And you know, girls and women have got to get screened
[2:37:07.380 --> 2:37:13.140]  so that they, if there are cervical cancer, uh, changes, they can get intervention and they can
[2:37:13.140 --> 2:37:18.660]  prevent off of 100% cervical cancer. Well, let's say this was a great vaccine. It wasn't a live
[2:37:18.660 --> 2:37:23.140]  cancer virus. It wasn't killing people and it, Merck was in a wicked company involved with every
[2:37:23.140 --> 2:37:28.900]  other form of evil, uh, in the past, uh, with these vaccines and drugs. Then you wouldn't target
[2:37:28.900 --> 2:37:33.540]  11 and 12 year old girls. You would target promiscuous prostitutes and drug addicts.
[2:37:34.580 --> 2:37:39.940]  Well, you, if you are in a high risk category, that is, you know, you, you have sex with multiple
[2:37:39.940 --> 2:37:46.980]  partners or you, uh, are a smoker or whatever you may, and if you have cervical cancer in your
[2:37:46.980 --> 2:37:52.580]  family, you know, you may want to consider, you're right, want to consider this, uh, a vaccine. But
[2:37:52.580 --> 2:37:57.540]  you know, I actually think it's very important for people to understand that if they come from a
[2:37:57.540 --> 2:38:03.700]  family, uh, with autoimmune disorders and autoimmune disorders are things like rheumatoid arthritis,
[2:38:03.700 --> 2:38:10.580]  lupus, diabetes, Crohn's, thyroid disease, these people who come from a family where you've got
[2:38:10.580 --> 2:38:16.740]  allergy or autoimmune disorders, I believe are at increased risk for having reactions. Well,
[2:38:16.740 --> 2:38:19.700]  there's no doubt, but let's stop there. I want to get the numbers because you've got all the
[2:38:19.700 --> 2:38:25.060]  numbers from the studies, from the CDC. I mean, you've got it all right there. Seeing an insane
[2:38:25.060 --> 2:38:30.740]  26,000 adverse reactions, you know, 20 something deaths. I mean, just in the trials, there were
[2:38:30.740 --> 2:38:34.660]  three confirmed deaths and when they started it last year, a bunch of other deaths. What are the
[2:38:34.660 --> 2:38:40.020]  best numbers we've got? Well, you know, I don't know where that the 26,000 figure. I'm not sure
[2:38:40.020 --> 2:38:44.980]  where that comes from. I, I just went on the database this morning and they're, and it's
[2:38:44.980 --> 2:38:51.460]  actually lower for Gardasil. It's about 20, 7,600, but those 7,600 reactions have been reported
[2:38:51.460 --> 2:38:56.660]  to the government comprised 20 to 25% of all the reactions that are occurring in the last
[2:38:56.660 --> 2:39:01.060]  two years that have been reported to the government. The death count, depending upon what
[2:39:01.060 --> 2:39:07.860]  database you look at it, between 17 and 20 deaths. But we, again, we know, I know a couple of deaths
[2:39:07.860 --> 2:39:14.900]  that have not yet been reported to the government and will be reported within the next week.
[2:39:14.900 --> 2:39:21.140]  So we, we don't really know how many truly there are out there. What we do know is the majority
[2:39:21.140 --> 2:39:27.460]  of physicians refuse to report hospitalizations, injuries and deaths, falling vaccination.
[2:39:27.460 --> 2:39:35.220]  I get this all the time at NVIC that doctors will not report these events because they have been
[2:39:35.220 --> 2:39:39.460]  told by the American County Pediatrics and the Centers of Disease Control that when anything
[2:39:39.460 --> 2:39:45.540]  bad happens after vaccination, it's a coincidence. And that's the coincidence defense is what the
[2:39:45.540 --> 2:39:49.060]  government and industry had been using for a year. And they love passing the, I mean,
[2:39:49.060 --> 2:39:53.380]  they even said that when swine flu was killing thousands, that vaccine. I mean, they do this
[2:39:53.380 --> 2:39:58.180]  over and over again. And, and they love passing the buck because they want to live in denial
[2:39:58.180 --> 2:40:03.700]  and they don't want to get sued for liability. Well, I mean, the coincidence defense is illogical.
[2:40:03.700 --> 2:40:10.580]  It's unscientific. When, when you start seeing many people reporting the same reactions occurring
[2:40:10.580 --> 2:40:16.100]  within the same time period after vaccination, having the same permit injuries or dying,
[2:40:16.100 --> 2:40:22.340]  this is not coincidence. But, but even, I mean, but I mean, they look, we got the CDC documents
[2:40:22.340 --> 2:40:26.020]  from 2000 through Congressman Dan Burton's committee. I only talk about that where they said
[2:40:26.020 --> 2:40:30.980]  we've got to cover up that mercury brain damage millions of people. Now that's ABC News. So we've
[2:40:30.980 --> 2:40:35.540]  caught them over and over again, covering up what's going on. Is it a conspiracy theory that
[2:40:35.540 --> 2:40:41.140]  Vioxx caused tens of thousands of heart attacks and deaths? The, the, the, the merc drug? No,
[2:40:41.140 --> 2:40:45.860]  none of this is, is it a conspiracy theory that hundreds of thousands of children were born
[2:40:45.860 --> 2:40:53.060]  deformed with stunted arms and legs from, you know, in the 60s where they popular tranquilizer? No.
[2:40:53.860 --> 2:40:59.220]  Only in this modern age do they deny this. And they use the word coincidence. And they think
[2:40:59.220 --> 2:41:04.100]  that's a scientific term that it's a coincidence that it just happened to occur at the same.
[2:41:04.100 --> 2:41:10.660]  And they're basically saying that healthy teenage girls and what's really interesting is a lot of
[2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:16.820]  these girls are the brightest and the best. They're star athletes, they're honor roll students, and
[2:41:16.820 --> 2:41:24.420]  they, they get this shot and then within 48 hours are dead. Now you tell me that's a coincidence.
[2:41:24.420 --> 2:41:29.220]  Now let's explain, let's explain, and it's always the same. They swell up, start bleeding,
[2:41:29.220 --> 2:41:33.620]  get rashes all over them. Oh, and then with the tens of thousands of adverse reactions,
[2:41:33.620 --> 2:41:37.380]  it's always the same thing. It's no big deal. It's wonderful. Mommy, you love your daughter,
[2:41:37.380 --> 2:41:44.580]  go give her the shot. Now, let's, let's talk about, let's talk about what this vaccine is.
[2:41:45.380 --> 2:41:51.780]  Well, let, this vaccine is a, what I call a heavy protein vaccine. It's got yeast protein,
[2:41:51.780 --> 2:41:59.220]  it has aluminum. It is, it is supposed to prevent HPV infection. In other words,
[2:41:59.220 --> 2:42:05.700]  they call it a cervical cancer vaccine, but it's actually designed to prevent the actual infection,
[2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:11.140]  HPV infection, which can lead, as I said, after many years of chronic infection,
[2:42:11.140 --> 2:42:15.140]  can lead to cervical lesions and then go on to be cervical cancer.
[2:42:15.140 --> 2:42:19.540]  But let's be clear, you're not even getting into the live cancer virus that's in it.
[2:42:22.100 --> 2:42:28.580]  The live cancer virus. Yes, yes, the HPV has the protein shell of the virus. Go ahead.
[2:42:28.580 --> 2:42:34.980]  Right, but it's not, it's not actually a live vaccine. It's not live virus vaccine.
[2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:39.460]  Well, well, from the doctors we've had on, they say that Merck makes a distinction and claims,
[2:42:40.180 --> 2:42:44.020]  but there's a whole debate whether viruses are alive to begin with. So that's a
[2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:48.740]  semantical argument. The point is, is there virus shells in the shot?
[2:42:49.300 --> 2:42:54.420]  There is viral DNA. Yes. Okay, there you go. Thank you. Well, a virus, they argue, you know,
[2:42:55.700 --> 2:43:00.180]  there's a whole scientific debate, you know, for 70 years about whether a virus is alive or not.
[2:43:00.180 --> 2:43:03.540]  So that's where Merck's playing a semantical game, but go ahead.
[2:43:03.540 --> 2:43:09.220]  Yeah, no, and see what I, and I've been, you know, when it was like a live virus vaccine,
[2:43:09.220 --> 2:43:16.180]  like the live oral polio vaccine or the live MMR vaccine, this is not described by the company
[2:43:16.180 --> 2:43:21.700]  anyway as that. So I understand the distinction that you're making, but it is. We got a media that
[2:43:21.700 --> 2:43:26.660]  says that Russia attacked Georgia first. I mean, it's a fact that Georgia attacked Russia first.
[2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:32.340]  I mean, the point is, is that it is that I've had doctors on, they've said that Merck is wrong
[2:43:32.340 --> 2:43:35.540]  for all intents and purposes. This is a, this is a complete virus.
[2:43:36.180 --> 2:43:41.540]  Right. Okay. Well, I, you know, I haven't gotten down to that detail. I'm not a scientist. I only
[2:43:41.540 --> 2:43:47.220]  have gone on what, what I have learned through the, the documents that Merck has released. And
[2:43:47.220 --> 2:43:51.380]  if they're not calling it live virus, then, you know, I, I just, I understand. Continue and cover
[2:43:51.380 --> 2:43:58.420]  the key points. Yeah. Um, I think that what we, what we have to, to realize is, as I said before,
[2:43:58.420 --> 2:44:03.780]  that if you get the regular pap smears, you do not have to, you don't have to worry about
[2:44:04.340 --> 2:44:10.180]  getting cervical cancer. And even one of the researchers, Diane Harper, who has worked on
[2:44:10.180 --> 2:44:15.620]  the development of the vaccine, said in a recent Medscape article, she made this point over and
[2:44:15.620 --> 2:44:20.100]  over again. If you're worried about the reactivity of the vaccine, you need to know that if you get
[2:44:20.100 --> 2:44:25.220]  regular pap smears, you can prevent cervical cancer. You can prevent that HPV infection
[2:44:25.220 --> 2:44:30.340]  from, from being, you know, being infected for many years and going on to, to cause cervical
[2:44:30.340 --> 2:44:35.060]  cancer. So, I mean, what, what, in the third world where there are no pap, there are no pap
[2:44:35.060 --> 2:44:40.980]  smears, cervical cancer is the number one or two killer of women in this country. Since the 1950s,
[2:44:40.980 --> 2:44:46.260]  we've had a 72% drop in cervical cancer because we've had pap smears. What are the, I mean,
[2:44:46.260 --> 2:44:50.500]  I've got some of the reports here, but from your research, what are the scientists, epidemiologists,
[2:44:50.500 --> 2:44:55.380]  virologists, uh, the, why are they saying it's killing people? I mean, what's the, what's the
[2:44:55.380 --> 2:45:01.620]  data on that? Why is it causing convulsions, autoimmune, people collapsing, paralysis, death?
[2:45:01.620 --> 2:45:06.660]  I mean, what, what is it doing? You know, this is something, when I sat on the FDA vaccine,
[2:45:06.660 --> 2:45:10.180]  the related biological prior to the Pfizer community for four years as the consumer member,
[2:45:10.180 --> 2:45:15.220]  that is the committee that looked at the data that the companies present to prove that a new
[2:45:15.220 --> 2:45:20.260]  vaccine is safe and effective. I always was asking them when they would report the seizures,
[2:45:20.260 --> 2:45:24.660]  occur after vaccination or death, I would say, what is the biological mechanism?
[2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:29.620]  That is, what is the vaccine doing in the body to cause that reaction? And none of them would
[2:45:29.620 --> 2:45:35.460]  ever answer the question because they don't know. And you know, we have one of the really interesting
[2:45:35.460 --> 2:45:40.980]  reactions that are occurring after this shot is what, an atypical collapse. The girls will get
[2:45:40.980 --> 2:45:46.660]  vaccinated and within 24 hours, they will, they will lapse into unconsciousness. And when they
[2:45:46.660 --> 2:45:50.900]  come to, they will have seizure activity and they won't be able to speak properly. And they won't,
[2:45:50.900 --> 2:45:56.900]  they'll have, you know, not able to see out of one or both eyes. It's an accident across
[2:45:56.900 --> 2:46:01.940]  entire different families of vaccines. It's an accident. Yeah. And so what they,
[2:46:02.900 --> 2:46:08.340]  yeah, exactly. And so these girls are having seizure and neurological type activity after
[2:46:08.340 --> 2:46:14.020]  they after this. Now, what is the mechanism of this collapse? We don't know. And in fact,
[2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:20.100]  I got a call from a nurse that heads up a number of outpatient departments in California
[2:46:21.140 --> 2:46:27.380]  last week who said to me, are you receiving reports of girls passing out after this vaccine?
[2:46:27.380 --> 2:46:33.380]  I said, absolutely. She said, this vaccine is unlike any other vaccine we use. It is causing
[2:46:33.380 --> 2:46:39.140]  girls to not only immediately pass out, but as I pointed out, you can be, you can be crossing
[2:46:39.140 --> 2:46:45.380]  the street, you can be driving a car and you can pass out after getting vaccinated that girls
[2:46:45.380 --> 2:46:49.780]  should not drive them. So let me tell you what, in, in, in the history, and then you're right,
[2:46:49.780 --> 2:46:54.020]  this one's worse statistically, but then in the military, especially with this collapsing within
[2:46:54.020 --> 2:46:58.420]  24 hours, sometimes the babies, as you know, at 18 months up to the third round of shots
[2:46:58.420 --> 2:47:05.620]  from the mercury alone, it causes inflammation on the brain and then people pass out. So that's
[2:47:05.620 --> 2:47:12.500]  associated with it. Well, all vaccines can cause brain inflammation. Every vaccine can cause
[2:47:12.500 --> 2:47:19.460]  brain inflammation. Smallpox vaccine was the first vaccine and it was a known vaccine to cause
[2:47:19.460 --> 2:47:23.060]  inflammation of the brain and permanent brain. Let's shift gears and tell, I'm going to get
[2:47:23.060 --> 2:47:26.820]  into what the flu shots they admit the last five plus years, they haven't picked the right
[2:47:26.820 --> 2:47:30.180]  flu of the year. So it's been totally worthless. They didn't pick which one it was going to be
[2:47:30.180 --> 2:47:34.500]  to make the vaccine for the mutation. They had to suspend five years ago. The smallpox
[2:47:34.500 --> 2:47:38.420]  shot because it killed so many people, quote, first responders, they were trying to force to
[2:47:38.420 --> 2:47:44.180]  take it. Now the federal court ruling, yes, autism has been caused by shots. I mean,
[2:47:44.180 --> 2:47:49.140]  this stuff's really coming out. Well, it is an influenza vaccine has now, there have been
[2:47:49.140 --> 2:47:53.540]  several reviews of medical literature showing that it doesn't really work in the elderly,
[2:47:53.540 --> 2:47:58.820]  elderly or in the young. In other words, the flu vaccine, influenza vaccine that contains
[2:47:58.820 --> 2:48:04.340]  three of the three strains that the CDC and the World Health Organization think are the
[2:48:04.340 --> 2:48:08.740]  ones that are going to be most prevalent and cause influenza. And by the way,
[2:48:08.740 --> 2:48:14.740]  less than 20% of all flu-like illness, if any given flu season is actually influenza,
[2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:20.100]  so you have a very remote chance when you get vaccinated of having actually come into contact
[2:48:20.100 --> 2:48:25.140]  with that. One of those three strains of influenza plus 20% is flu. It's totally pointless, yeah.
[2:48:26.340 --> 2:48:29.380]  But you've seen all the studies about the increase in Alzheimer's
[2:48:29.380 --> 2:48:35.620]  after multiple shots in the elderly. Well, and you see influenza vaccine contains aluminum
[2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:42.660]  and aluminum has been associated with Alzheimer's. So there is a question. People are asking the
[2:48:42.660 --> 2:48:47.140]  question. Of course, they have the elderly get this flu vaccine every year. Well, they're not
[2:48:47.140 --> 2:48:50.900]  answering the question after they've had three of them in a row. They can't ask it anymore.
[2:48:50.900 --> 2:48:57.540]  I know, I know. It's bye-bye lights out. Government loves you. Government, we don't know what's
[2:48:57.540 --> 2:49:03.300]  going on. We don't know all these people are dying. We just are a bunch of eugenicists. Trust us.
[2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:08.580]  And you know, the thing that breaks my heart is that when people are injured by vaccines,
[2:49:08.580 --> 2:49:14.180]  they basically become a minority that is harassed and persecuted in that nobody wants
[2:49:14.180 --> 2:49:18.580]  anything to do with them. The doctors don't want to treat them because they don't know how to treat
[2:49:18.580 --> 2:49:25.380]  them. The government doesn't want to pay them because they feel that every admission of a
[2:49:25.380 --> 2:49:30.340]  vaccine injury or death, every award in the compensation program is admission that the
[2:49:30.340 --> 2:49:35.700]  vaccines can cause injury and death. So they fight every single award. And so when you,
[2:49:35.700 --> 2:49:43.220]  when you get injured, you are really on your own. Well, Barbara, aren't we starting to win the fight,
[2:49:43.220 --> 2:49:47.460]  though? And in the past, they could trick 95% of us into taking them. And in the schools,
[2:49:47.460 --> 2:49:52.820]  now that people are waking up, they're trying to claim it's mandatory, push that hoax into Jersey,
[2:49:52.820 --> 2:49:57.620]  other places. I mean, aren't you seeing an explosive sea change of awakening as people
[2:49:57.620 --> 2:50:02.660]  see the damage for themselves? Absolutely. I think that what people are experiencing in their
[2:50:02.660 --> 2:50:07.300]  homes after they take their children for vaccination, and then they ask their doctors,
[2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:13.140]  and their doctors are denying everything, has caused this great crisis of faith. And it's
[2:50:13.140 --> 2:50:18.820]  a proper crisis of faith. They are told, given the wrong information, and then it's being
[2:50:18.820 --> 2:50:23.700]  denied that what has happened to their children is connected with the vaccine. And so what happens
[2:50:23.700 --> 2:50:28.500]  is they don't do the scientific studies to find out what the biological mechanisms are.
[2:50:28.500 --> 2:50:33.860]  They don't do the studies to find out how many, and they just cover it up. But I do see a change.
[2:50:33.860 --> 2:50:38.100]  I see a great public awareness, and your program and other media have done a lot
[2:50:38.660 --> 2:50:44.020]  to make people aware of this. Folks, let's do even more. Let's bring these murderers to justice
[2:50:44.020 --> 2:50:50.100]  by exposing them in vic.org, the National Vaccine Information Center. Your call straight ahead
[2:50:50.100 --> 2:50:54.180]  with an amazing lady, Barbara Lowe Fisher. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:50:58.740 --> 2:51:03.700]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[2:51:03.700 --> 2:51:08.180]  9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the
[2:51:08.180 --> 2:51:13.220]  New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? It was engineered by you,
[2:51:13.220 --> 2:51:20.500]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR. The day that we stop asking questions
[2:51:20.500 --> 2:51:25.140]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:51:25.140 --> 2:51:30.020]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:51:31.220 --> 2:51:34.660]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:51:37.860 --> 2:51:41.380]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:51:41.380 --> 2:51:46.260]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[2:51:46.260 --> 2:51:49.620]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.

[2:51:59.060 --> 2:52:03.700]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[2:52:03.700 --> 2:52:08.260]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[2:52:08.260 --> 2:52:13.060]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:52:13.060 --> 2:52:18.260]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce
[2:52:18.260 --> 2:52:24.580]  chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:30.340]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:34.740]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine,

[2:54:01.620 --> 2:54:22.340]  You got a bunch of crazy eugenicists that believe in survival of the fittest and their
[2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:29.940]  created HIV. Their pharmaceuticals shipped out millions of ampoules of HIV filled factor
[2:54:29.940 --> 2:54:37.140]  rate, hepatitis filled, conservatively killed 500,000 people MSNBC. Just calmly, oh yeah,
[2:54:37.140 --> 2:54:41.940]  they knew and knowingly shipped it out for a decade. You can't trust these companies to do
[2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:47.940]  anything and it's not accidents, it's not screw ups. I mean they breed these viruses and these
[2:54:47.940 --> 2:54:53.540]  different pathogens up in these tanks with all sorts of other live matter. They're always
[2:54:53.540 --> 2:55:02.900]  quote contaminated. The polio vaccine we played Dr. Sars admitting it was bred in bioweapon monkeys
[2:55:02.900 --> 2:55:08.340]  that had had scores of other viruses tested on them and they grew it in kidneys, monkey kidneys.
[2:55:09.700 --> 2:55:15.540]  They butchered the monkeys that have been tested on and then you've got the U.S. government,
[2:55:15.540 --> 2:55:20.660]  you know, cancer weapons program. The Rockefellers were involved in that back in the 30s.
[2:55:20.660 --> 2:55:24.660]  These are some hardcore people and you take any of their shots, any of their vaccines,
[2:55:24.660 --> 2:55:27.780]  you're out of your mind. Our guest to me with us about 15, 20 minutes the next hour has been

[2:56:10.580 --> 2:56:14.900]  your neighbor, your friends, your family, others, community, have you donated an end game or a
[2:56:14.900 --> 2:56:19.780]  terror storm to your local library? Have you shown it at your local university? We need you to become
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:23.780]  leaders and we have the tools to do it and we need you to expose what's happening here. Okay,
[2:56:23.780 --> 2:56:27.300]  I've been throwing out a lot of points picking your brain. In the four minutes we've gotten this
[2:56:27.300 --> 2:56:30.900]  segment, I want to then want to come back and take calls. In the four minutes, any other key areas
[2:56:30.900 --> 2:56:34.660]  you want to cover, the big victory with the feds having to admit the mercury caused the brain
[2:56:34.660 --> 2:56:41.620]  damage, what else? Well, I think that what is coming up is that people need to be aware that
[2:56:41.620 --> 2:56:47.060]  there are several hundred vaccines in more than 2,000 clinical trials worldwide that are being
[2:56:47.060 --> 2:56:53.860]  developed and the companies want to make sure that these vaccines are mandated. There are many,
[2:56:53.860 --> 2:56:58.980]  many more vaccines coming and so what we need to do is we need to work at the state level
[2:56:58.980 --> 2:57:04.820]  to get the, they want to take away the exemptions that we have, the religious and the conscientious
[2:57:04.820 --> 2:57:09.780]  belief or philosophical belief exemption. There is an attempt being made in New York,
[2:57:09.780 --> 2:57:16.100]  California and other states that every time the CDC recommends a new vaccine for universal use,
[2:57:16.100 --> 2:57:23.300]  like HPV vaccine, it will be automatically added to state laws and right now we do have the right
[2:57:23.300 --> 2:57:27.860]  to be exempted. If we can find a doctor to write a medical exemption, which is almost impossible,
[2:57:27.860 --> 2:57:33.700]  if we can file a religious exemption or if we file in 18 states as a personal belief or
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:37.380]  philosophical or contractual. How about they just go to hell and they're not going to put any of
[2:57:37.380 --> 2:57:41.860]  their bio weapons or chemical weapons in my children? Well seriously a lot of parents are
[2:57:41.860 --> 2:57:48.580]  homeschooling in order to try to avoid this more oppressive and now in New Jersey and California
[2:57:48.580 --> 2:57:54.020]  they're forcibly coming trying to force injections. Yes they're trying to make the CDC a de facto
[2:57:54.020 --> 2:58:01.300]  lawmaking body that is when the CDC says puts the universal use label on a vaccine which they have
[2:58:01.300 --> 2:58:10.820]  now put it on 16 vaccines. We've gone from 23 doses of seven vaccines in 1982 to 69 doses
[2:58:10.820 --> 2:58:17.540]  of 16 vaccines that the government says we have to give our children as of 2000. Stay there,
[2:58:17.540 --> 2:58:22.740]  stay there, we'll be right back in one minute, one minute break and this is a forced market,
[2:58:22.740 --> 2:58:26.420]  they come in, they lobby the government, they try to lie and claim it's the law,
[2:58:26.420 --> 2:58:30.660]  they're already saying it's the law and when it's not now they're trying to make laws to make you
[2:58:30.660 --> 2:58:35.140]  and your family take them. I mean if that isn't tyranny I don't know what is and you can take
[2:58:35.140 --> 2:58:45.620]  your shot and you can roll over and die. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[2:59:53.540 --> 3:00:19.460]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. We're not embellishing. We're not exaggerating. We're
[3:00:19.460 --> 3:00:25.620]  cold hard facts. California Illinois courts are ruling the homeschooling is illegal. The government
[3:00:25.620 --> 3:00:33.140]  says they own your children. They're already having the media announcing huge hoaxes. It's the law
[3:00:33.140 --> 3:00:37.940]  you'll go to jail if you don't take the shots. Children by the thousands line up with dogs
[3:00:37.940 --> 3:00:44.420]  barking police and riot here in Maryland. St. George County. We had the head guy on. I mean this is
[3:00:44.420 --> 3:00:49.860]  really happening and now hundreds of new vaccines more advanced ones with all these virus parts and
[3:00:49.860 --> 3:00:55.140]  the rest of it coming out. The deaths are mounting. We played mainstream newscasts where they forcibly
[3:00:55.140 --> 3:00:59.140]  inject troops and say it's secret. They won't tell them what it is. People start having convulsions
[3:00:59.140 --> 3:01:04.900]  dropping dead. Whole groups of people getting sick. I've had Rick Perry's media coordinator come up to
[3:01:04.900 --> 3:01:09.620]  me out of theater and I know I've seen him on the news say yeah I was at Fort Sam Houston. We gave
[3:01:09.620 --> 3:01:14.500]  people shots and they all died. Then we're told scrub everything. I mean this is this is crazy. But
[3:01:14.500 --> 3:01:19.380]  the media covers most of this up so we're all compartmentalized and don't know this is the big
[3:01:19.380 --> 3:01:26.420]  issue. I mean this is going on. Just unbelievable what's happening and Barbara Lowe Fisher let's
[3:01:26.420 --> 3:01:30.740]  take some calls and before you leave us get back into the fact that they're about to push to go
[3:01:30.740 --> 3:01:37.060]  from hoaxing saying it's the law to really coming. Now they got police taking blood and federal funds
[3:01:37.060 --> 3:01:40.900]  on side of the road. That's to get used to cops getting involved in your life and doing medical
[3:01:40.900 --> 3:01:46.260]  procedures. I mean this is hellish and don't worry cops are going to make you take them too so enjoy.
[3:01:46.980 --> 3:01:52.420]  Let's go ahead and go back to Aaron who was on earlier. Aaron tell her the story.
[3:01:53.700 --> 3:02:00.660]  My sister who's 11 went with a babysitter not my mother but a babysitter to a routine physical
[3:02:00.660 --> 3:02:08.660]  and they gave her the first of the three shots for the HPV. Now unbelievable. Now what is it about?
[3:02:09.380 --> 3:02:15.300]  What is it about this that people can't get? You're letting governments which are historically
[3:02:15.300 --> 3:02:21.380]  become evil. A mainline something into your child veins. They're not feeding them something.
[3:02:21.380 --> 3:02:26.580]  They're not brainwashing the school. No they're mainlining something into their veins past all
[3:02:26.580 --> 3:02:31.300]  of the body's natural defenses. What is it about people that... Yeah but tell her what happened
[3:02:31.300 --> 3:02:38.180]  to your sister. Well she got sick. It wasn't like she got incredibly ill but it was noticeably ill
[3:02:38.180 --> 3:02:44.580]  for a good week after just that one shot. I mean she's a strong kid and it was it was noticeable.
[3:02:44.580 --> 3:02:50.180]  Well that's the one silver lining here as I've been reading Barbara head of the vaccine
[3:02:50.820 --> 3:02:55.460]  National Vaccine Information Center is that this is so bad that they're not getting the full three
[3:02:55.460 --> 3:03:00.260]  shots in many cases because they do get so sick on the first one. Well and that's a good thing
[3:03:00.260 --> 3:03:05.540]  that they're paying attention and not continuing to vaccinate. I have a lot of doctors who ignore
[3:03:05.540 --> 3:03:10.740]  all the signs the child is having a problem with the vaccine and when you continue to vaccinate in
[3:03:10.740 --> 3:03:16.580]  the face of worsening health that's when you become brain damaged or dying. You can do it on the
[3:03:16.580 --> 3:03:23.140]  first shot but oftentimes it's because they won't stop. So I you know I urge everyone to find to
[3:03:23.140 --> 3:03:28.420]  understand what these symptoms are so that they if they somehow find themselves like this little girl
[3:03:28.420 --> 3:03:33.700]  I mean at least the parents were well enough aware that the child got sick that the child is not
[3:03:33.700 --> 3:03:38.420]  going to get more vaccine. Well Barbara I've been at community pools on vacation in a hot tub at a
[3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:42.500]  grocery store and I'll walk over and I'll go I see your son's autistic and they go yes he is
[3:03:43.060 --> 3:03:49.140]  and I say was he uh when did it happen 18 months old and I'll say did it happen within one day of
[3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:53.380]  the shot yeah he just went in the corner and he was gone it's always the same just your government
[3:03:53.380 --> 3:03:58.980]  loves you. Well the 18 month is when they can get eight to 12 shots if they haven't gotten all their
[3:03:58.980 --> 3:04:04.820]  shots up to date you know they're allowed to get 12 shots on one day now I mean it's unbelievable
[3:04:04.820 --> 3:04:11.220]  how many vaccines are being put into four months six months old babies uh on one day. And people
[3:04:11.220 --> 3:04:15.860]  like doctors and nurses or gods they won't even question when they're getting 12 shots little
[3:04:15.860 --> 3:04:21.460]  bit human. Just go ahead kill your kids you're not going to listen I know it's just they won't
[3:04:21.460 --> 3:04:28.020]  listen they have to have a dead kid first. And that's what's so sad is you know we have trusted
[3:04:28.020 --> 3:04:34.740]  I mean we have we have treated uh doctors as if they are gods and what was the first commandment
[3:04:34.740 --> 3:04:40.980]  thou shalt have no have no other gods before me I think that we need to understand that we have
[3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:46.820]  these doctors and scientists are people they're human beings they're subject to all the temptations
[3:04:46.820 --> 3:04:51.620]  all the frailties that every other human being is. Barbara stay there one more person Erin knows
[3:04:51.620 --> 3:04:56.100]  got sick stay there we'll come back with Erin then we're going to get to John Charles Roberto
[3:04:56.100 --> 3:05:04.260]  and others stay with us. Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs

[3:10:04.500 --> 3:10:10.340]  is real okay well thank you so much anything else erin i just want to tell barbara your favorite
[3:10:10.340 --> 3:10:14.900]  quote which is that in the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man in this case a woman
[3:10:15.700 --> 3:10:20.660]  hated fear and scorn however in time when her cause succeeds the timid will join her for then
[3:10:20.660 --> 3:10:24.900]  it'll cost nothing to be a patriot five years down the road you're gonna have tens of thousands
[3:10:24.900 --> 3:10:29.780]  of people thanking you for saving their children from this well that's the good you know thank you
[3:10:29.780 --> 3:10:35.860]  i mean the good news is that these murderers these corrupt people they're being exposed
[3:10:35.860 --> 3:10:39.700]  so they're trying to fail forward to now it's okay it's the law we're gonna give you hundreds
[3:10:39.700 --> 3:10:44.980]  of shots shut up barbara can you speak to that oh yeah you know i mean one of the things that i
[3:10:44.980 --> 3:10:49.300]  remember 10 years ago they started working on a vaccine that will be getting that they want to
[3:10:49.300 --> 3:10:54.660]  give at the moment of the baby emerges from the womb it will contain 20 to 40 different bacterial
[3:10:54.660 --> 3:10:59.860]  and viral antigens it will inject raw DNA directly to the cells of the baby and it will be time
[3:10:59.860 --> 3:11:05.540]  released uh... throughout the next few years uh... they don't answer what will happen if the baby
[3:11:05.540 --> 3:11:10.820]  is damaged or a reaction the first time release but when i thought that they called it the holy
[3:11:10.820 --> 3:11:16.580]  grail when i thought that i knew we were dealing with people who absolutely had lost all reason
[3:11:17.300 --> 3:11:24.740]  we cannot allow ourselves to be exploited uh... by scientists and physicians who have lost their
[3:11:24.740 --> 3:11:30.340]  way i am not against science and physicians i know some very fine doctors who are trying to
[3:11:30.340 --> 3:11:35.780]  uh... work to try to change that they have the paradigm shift in that so that we can have truly
[3:11:35.780 --> 3:11:41.220]  health care that is not poisonous to us but right now we are way too pet dependent on drugs and
[3:11:41.220 --> 3:11:46.180]  vaccines we think that is what is going to keep us healthy uh... the fact that we have now
[3:11:46.180 --> 3:11:52.180]  uh... 69 doses of 16 vaccines of the government is saying we have to give our children in the
[3:11:52.180 --> 3:11:57.540]  first 18 years of life in order for them to remain healthy and yet we have in this country now
[3:11:57.540 --> 3:12:03.300]  one in six child learning disabled one in nine asthmatic one in one hundred to one hundred and
[3:12:03.300 --> 3:12:09.540]  fifty developing autism one in four hundred fifty suffering with diabetes we've given our children
[3:12:09.540 --> 3:12:14.980]  all these vaccines like we were told to do and what do we have we have almost twenty to twenty
[3:12:14.980 --> 3:12:18.980]  five percent of our children now chronically ill and disabled we have a chronic disease and
[3:12:18.980 --> 3:12:24.740]  disability epidemic that out that has hurt more children than any infectious disease epidemic
[3:12:24.740 --> 3:12:30.820]  epidemic in our history including smallpox and polio and so we have got to wake up
[3:12:30.820 --> 3:12:36.900]  and not just be sheep and blindly obey what we're told we you need to become your own researcher
[3:12:36.900 --> 3:12:40.340]  and that's why we put up the national vaccine information center website
[3:12:40.340 --> 3:12:45.140]  because we want people to become empowered and become educated health care consumers
[3:12:45.140 --> 3:12:51.780]  and stand up for their right their human right to make informed voluntary decisions about any
[3:12:51.780 --> 3:12:56.900]  medical procedure that they that they are their child undergoes most specifically vaccination
[3:12:59.220 --> 3:13:03.220]  did you know that fema was caught last year we reported a year and a half before it was in the
[3:13:03.220 --> 3:13:10.260]  news with these sermons they're supposed to give their covertly paid and hired by fema 26 000 of
[3:13:10.260 --> 3:13:14.660]  now prominent ones that's that's most the prominent preachers in the country and they tell them in
[3:13:14.660 --> 3:13:18.740]  amongst all the others about submitting to government romance 13 they said take the shots
[3:13:18.740 --> 3:13:25.460]  the government tells you and and and and an emergency let them give you shots i mean boy
[3:13:25.460 --> 3:13:31.860]  this is a very diabolical thing we're dealing with we have now a secret what across a secret
[3:13:31.860 --> 3:13:39.060]  agency within hhs called barda that was passed as part of bio shield to legislation oh bio shield
[3:13:39.060 --> 3:13:45.060]  one and bio shield two shields to manufacturers and vaccine providers whenever the secretary of
[3:13:45.060 --> 3:13:51.940]  hhs declares an emergency and that emergency has a very wide definition uh shield them from
[3:13:51.940 --> 3:13:57.140]  liability uh so that there were also the mild state health emergency powers act passed after
[3:13:57.140 --> 3:14:02.100]  nine one one there were a lot of opportunities after nine one one who went into the state and
[3:14:02.100 --> 3:14:07.940]  federal law and passed these these public health laws that are very very oppressive and this barda
[3:14:07.940 --> 3:14:13.860]  did this this agency within hhs is working with the company to develop secret drugs and vaccines
[3:14:13.860 --> 3:14:19.620]  that will be used in these times of quote emergency whenever the yeah and in conjunction
[3:14:19.620 --> 3:14:25.780]  under bio shield rid of yourself with 36 bio weapons labs of the bio weapon labs are gonna help
[3:14:25.780 --> 3:14:31.700]  let's go ahead and uh take another call here let's talk to john in new hampshire go ahead john
[3:14:32.660 --> 3:14:39.060]  alex um i just wanted to share a story with my um older brother he um uh had a child in

[3:14:45.940 --> 3:14:50.740]  of time had told him you know they did not want to vaccinate the child i mean they're very very
[3:14:50.740 --> 3:14:57.060]  clear about it and um uh you know basically you know the nurses would um you know pretty much
[3:14:57.060 --> 3:15:01.700]  corner them and you know make them feel like he's like some child abuser and ostracize them and
[3:15:01.700 --> 3:15:06.020]  really put a lot of pressure on them they ran and get the doctor and you know oh you got a
[3:15:06.020 --> 3:15:10.660]  vaccinate this child and you know it was just unbelievable how they've bombarded him so anyway
[3:15:10.660 --> 3:15:16.020]  when the baby was born they did it again and uh basically then um you know when he just held
[3:15:16.020 --> 3:15:22.020]  his ground him and his wife um they basically said well you got signed um this authorization
[3:15:22.020 --> 3:15:27.300]  basically denying these vaccines so they gave them these uh and and and then that's free to
[3:15:27.300 --> 3:15:31.380]  pick up hold on a sheet of author will hold on a second i know and the sheets well i'm gonna

[3:15:35.940 --> 3:15:40.660]  was it was because he read you know him his wife read all you know two three pages whatever it was
[3:15:40.660 --> 3:15:45.540]  and it said you're abusing your child pretty much and says i agree i'm a criminal basically
[3:15:45.540 --> 3:15:49.860]  right and and he read the whole thing and was like there's no way which he was outraged i mean he
[3:15:49.860 --> 3:15:54.900]  just he told the doctor so then they call the cops uh they didn't call the police in this situation
[3:15:54.900 --> 3:15:59.540]  i mean my brother's pretty well but they call the cops well they do usually yeah criminals
[3:15:59.540 --> 3:16:05.860]  i mean it you know awesome job you know again exposing the corrupt eugenic scum government
[3:16:05.860 --> 3:16:10.820]  i mean i'm not trying to be funny like you said you know um you know this stuff is serious and
[3:16:10.820 --> 3:16:15.700]  and i don't want to go out there and pick a fight but i own a k-47 and these psychos ever come to
[3:16:15.700 --> 3:16:21.780]  my house to to euthanize and and do this these crazy things with my kids it's never gonna happen
[3:16:21.780 --> 3:16:29.220]  so just so the government know that i understand how you feel i i know that when the when parents
[3:16:29.220 --> 3:16:34.340]  go in when mothers go in and they're in labor and they go into the hospital and they have
[3:16:34.340 --> 3:16:39.460]  you sign these papers i've had stories of mothers who have been in active labor about to give birth
[3:16:39.460 --> 3:16:43.300]  where the nurses come in and ask them to sign these papers saying that they will give the
[3:16:43.300 --> 3:16:49.620]  hepatitis b vaccine within 12 hours of birth and these mothers are you know obviously
[3:16:49.620 --> 3:16:55.140]  uh is that a disadvantage uh what you have to do when you take your world always attack
[3:16:55.140 --> 3:17:00.820]  calving mammals go ahead yeah if you need to put when they ask you to sign those papers
[3:17:01.860 --> 3:17:06.820]  when you come in in labor you need to put at the top no vaccines to be given
[3:17:07.460 --> 3:17:12.740]  unless without my permission and then the father or somebody needs to be with you
[3:17:12.740 --> 3:17:17.300]  to keep to walk and you have to follow the baby at all times because they've been caught thousands
[3:17:17.300 --> 3:17:21.300]  of times doing it without consent that's right they will take the baby and they will give the
[3:17:21.300 --> 3:17:27.140]  vaccine the wolves always attack yeah it's really it's really important to just have your head up
[3:17:27.140 --> 3:17:32.740]  and and understand what's going on and we have had parents who have been taking their children to
[3:17:32.740 --> 3:17:38.260]  an emergency room when they're sick and the doctors have had are you up to date in your vaccine
[3:17:38.260 --> 3:17:43.380]  and they say and they say you because you don't have a record here and they say no and then they
[3:17:43.380 --> 3:17:48.100]  say well we're going to back to your child and if they refuse they call health protective
[3:17:48.100 --> 3:17:53.780]  services on and report them for what they call child medical abuse so you have to be very careful
[3:17:53.780 --> 3:17:57.780]  when you take your child into an emergency room visit if you are you haven't vaccinated or the
[3:17:57.780 --> 3:18:02.260]  child doesn't have all the vaccine you need to just say you're going to be seeing a doctor after
[3:18:02.260 --> 3:18:07.460]  the visit uh you just you you want to vaccinate a baby that is sick that's the one yeah the state
[3:18:07.460 --> 3:18:11.460]  absolutely yeah you never vaccinate someone when they're sick and this is what the military

[3:25:01.300 --> 3:25:06.740]  but defend yourselves people if it's a doctor if it's a physician and you go see him and you
[3:25:06.740 --> 3:25:11.700]  have a problem this is what you do as soon as he writes you a prescription for a prescription

[3:25:30.980 --> 3:25:38.100]  think well it's it's a story i've heard over and over again unfortunately for 26 years and you
[3:25:38.100 --> 3:25:42.340]  know i was looking to earlier in your show you know somebody called in and said you know

[3:25:49.300 --> 3:25:55.540]  it is true it's bad and i and i've seen it up close for 26 years but the reason i haven't given up
[3:25:55.540 --> 3:26:01.860]  is that i know i believe in my heart that we have to continue to do the right thing to the very end
[3:26:01.860 --> 3:26:08.660]  i mean only god is really in in the end will will be here and and and and is the one who is
[3:26:08.660 --> 3:26:14.820]  eventually going to be able to be right but we have to continue with faith and we have to do
[3:26:14.820 --> 3:26:20.340]  the right thing and that's all we're responsible for doing and so we have to get the information
[3:26:20.340 --> 3:26:24.980]  out there people have to become aware and then they have to stand up well take charlie sheen
[3:26:24.980 --> 3:26:29.620]  take charlie sheen he says i don't want to vaccinate our daughters his wife divorces him and

[3:42:28.260 --> 3:42:35.460]  not 11 just like in 2006 just like in 2007 it's an historic event where thousands of people go out
[3:42:35.460 --> 3:42:40.260]  in black investigate not 11 t-shirts and stand up with family members and rescue workers for not
[3:42:40.260 --> 3:42:45.460]  11 truth this is new york city this is where not 11 happened this is the anniversary everybody
[3:42:45.460 --> 3:42:52.340]  should be there this is always a huge emotional event that galvanizes many people to become
[3:42:52.980 --> 3:42:58.020]  to come not 11 truthers and it's historical every year to have so many people down there
[3:42:58.020 --> 3:43:03.060]  standing up for truth and we could take back 9 11 and we're doing it on an anniversary we're
[3:43:03.060 --> 3:43:07.620]  doing it on 9 11 and that's why it's so there's no doubt everybody to be out there there's no
[3:43:07.620 --> 3:43:14.580]  doubt the establishment really hates it uh when thousands of 9 11 truthers pour out on the streets
[3:43:14.580 --> 3:43:20.100]  and the momentum of 9 11 truth is just gaining and gaining and false flag terror has now entered
[3:43:20.100 --> 3:43:25.300]  the vernacular the nomenclature people understand it they're discussing it they understand staged
[3:43:25.300 --> 3:43:30.900]  events false flag self-inflicted wounds they now understand that the government stages events
[3:43:30.900 --> 3:43:35.780]  uh and that's key to stopping them carrying out future events or they stage more events
[3:43:35.780 --> 3:43:40.740]  not being able to stampede us uh into marshal law shifting gears luke i haven't even been so busy
[3:43:40.740 --> 3:43:45.540]  i've been talking to you privately what do you think of the huge effect uh the truth rising
[3:43:45.540 --> 3:43:51.300]  is having out there energizing activists telling the story of 9 11 truth and and and showing the
[3:43:51.300 --> 3:43:56.820]  people holding their corrupt elected officials accountable it's amazing you see people standing
[3:43:56.820 --> 3:44:01.780]  up everywhere in their local cities and towns getting a camera confronting their local politicians
[3:44:01.780 --> 3:44:07.380]  and their representatives it's amazing seeing our chapters grow and we have 60 chapters worldwide
[3:44:07.380 --> 3:44:12.420]  and all over the united states confronting politicians wherever they go it's amazing
[3:44:12.420 --> 3:44:18.660]  seeing people in australia people in germany people in italy stand up for truth and justice
[3:44:18.660 --> 3:44:22.420]  and just doing the right thing and being the change that they want to see in this world
[3:44:22.420 --> 3:44:28.500]  and that's why it's an amazing tool that people can use to motivate themselves to do something
[3:44:28.500 --> 3:44:33.780]  positive and it shows you how much of a difference one person can make uh how much of a small group
[3:44:33.780 --> 3:44:38.340]  of people can make a huge difference and if we all stand up we could do anything we want we just
[3:44:38.340 --> 3:44:43.140]  have to believe in it we have to dig down in ourselves find it in ourselves to be our own
[3:44:43.140 --> 3:44:49.060]  leaders and do the right thing and that's exactly what this documentary does and fabled enemies
[3:44:49.060 --> 3:44:53.700]  is coming out i produced it but jason's moved down here for the last uh hard to believe almost
[3:44:53.700 --> 3:44:59.860]  six months he's been uh quietly preparing footage getting ready for this the last two years uh jason
[3:44:59.860 --> 3:45:04.340]  bermus of course worked on the second edition with cori roe and the director dylan avery and then on
[3:45:04.340 --> 3:45:10.020]  the final cut that i executive produced well now this is bermus's film i'll have to give props
