[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he

[00:20.800 --> 00:36.120]  we are live on this August 2nd Sunday edition 2009 we're gonna be live here
[00:36.120 --> 00:40.360]  for the next two hours we're gonna have wide open phones we give you that toll
[00:40.360 --> 00:44.280]  free number right now talk about any issue or news item you wish to discuss

[00:54.520 --> 00:59.680]  martial law preparations that are being made the national and international push
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.560]  to forcibly inoculate the population with a flu vaccine which they admit will
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.160]  not help anyone even if you believe vaccines work it won't even match what
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.960]  the virus has already mutated into five different mutations in the last month
[01:15.960 --> 01:22.200]  just in Texas alone I was reading the CDC and the virus is one of the weakest
[01:22.200 --> 01:27.800]  flu virus has ever seen a weak flu kills tens of thousands a year this is a
[01:27.800 --> 01:33.240]  pathetic flu killing hundreds in the United States people with compromised
[01:33.240 --> 01:38.000]  immune systems but we'll discuss that because even though we know it's a hoax
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  the build-up is real the takeover is real so that is coming up we're also
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.120]  simulcasting the syndicated radio show today on the web at prisonplanet.tv
[01:50.120 --> 01:56.720]  and then Jason Burmese today when I go off air I will be live for three hours
[01:56.720 --> 02:01.360]  on the radio and the audio streams at info wars.com and prisonpana.com and
[02:01.360 --> 02:08.920]  prisonplanet.tv as well here is the incredibly important stack just one of
[02:08.920 --> 02:17.400]  the stacks I have bombshell bin Laden worked for us until 9-11 this was
[02:17.400 --> 02:22.160]  carried by the Mike Malloy radio show Mike's one of the better liberals on
[02:22.160 --> 02:27.720]  what was what's left to talk radio network Air America and he's also on XM on
[02:27.720 --> 02:32.360]  major stations in New York and Los Angeles and he had Sybil Edmunds on we
[02:32.360 --> 02:35.800]  got to get her back on had her on a few times every time we've had her on she
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.720]  she's been under a federal gag order looks like she's starting to break that
[02:39.720 --> 02:44.560]  federal gag order or testing what Obama will do well he clapper and irons she was
[02:44.560 --> 02:50.000]  a translator a person dialing in to classified transmissions at the
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.080]  National Security Agency and she told us years ago here that and she also told
[02:55.080 --> 03:00.120]  the 9-11 Commission in secret testimony that she heard the CIA working with
[03:00.120 --> 03:05.880]  narcotics traffickers weapons traffickers and child sex slave traffickers
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.880]  that they were working with Al Qaeda but then she was gagged and couldn't speak
[03:10.880 --> 03:14.680]  anymore since she knew a lot more well specifically she's saying that up until
[03:14.680 --> 03:23.520]  9-11 CIA commanding Osama bin Laden now we already knew this but this is from an
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.440]  inside eyewitness so I want to go over some of the backstory on this and
[03:27.440 --> 03:31.960]  break down her latest revelations coming up and I want Mike Malloy and
[03:31.960 --> 03:38.360]  Sybil Edmunds back on word to producers so that's coming up Obama's ratings fall
[03:38.360 --> 03:44.000]  back to earth he's gone from 84 to below 50 and plunging quickly a percentage
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.280]  point per week or more we've never seen a plunge this fast looks like he'll
[03:49.280 --> 03:53.720]  probably stage some terror attacks another headline the Barack backlash how
[03:53.720 --> 04:01.680]  Obama's presidency has gone from deity to doubtful also 27,000 pound swine flu
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.760]  bonus for general practitioners in England if they agree to give people the
[04:05.760 --> 04:15.800]  deadly flu shot they get 27,000 pounds or roughly $50,000 to carry out the hits
[04:15.800 --> 04:21.680]  hey you they could just become murderers hit men and get 10 20,000 pounds or
[04:21.680 --> 04:27.320]  $40,000 per hit go out and just murder people I mean why not get extra money
[04:27.320 --> 04:32.520]  Glenn Beck's actually done some good work and I've noticed people are attacking
[04:32.520 --> 04:37.320]  him but I went to the website and checked it yesterday and it's true the
[04:37.320 --> 04:40.640]  government says they take over your computer when you go to the website to
[04:40.640 --> 04:45.520]  look at cash for clunkers program so I'm on the business of defending Glenn
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.920]  Beck with facts are facts so that is coming up after this quick break as

[07:00.980 --> 07:06.240]  living in denial Army National Guard advertises for internment specialist
[07:06.240 --> 07:12.400]  inside the United States for federal prison camps and for relocation of
[07:12.400 --> 07:19.640]  citizens and for quartering the citizens in a corrections type environment
[07:19.640 --> 07:27.000]  and not just civilian intimate labor camps we have that linked in the article
[07:27.000 --> 07:33.240]  but we also the first link in the story is correction officers and internment
[07:33.240 --> 07:41.360]  resettlement specialist that is the first link in our article we also have a
[07:41.360 --> 07:48.800]  link to the civilian inmate labor camp program this is the giant archipelago
[07:48.800 --> 07:54.240]  of FEMA camps concentration camps built in the United States and that's all
[07:54.240 --> 08:02.880]  going to be sold to the American people so we'll be going over that report
[08:02.880 --> 08:12.840]  today and we'll go directly to the federal government advertising for
[08:12.840 --> 08:17.840]  internment resettlement specialists that the fact they're you at the National
[08:17.840 --> 08:23.480]  Guard website you can go there and learn all about putting the American people
[08:23.480 --> 08:31.880]  in concentration camps and of course the globalist always do this with with
[08:31.880 --> 08:36.840]  amazing skill they have the phony right-wing come out and attack Barack
[08:36.840 --> 08:42.880]  Obama for saying going to shut down Guantanamo Bay in an executive order but
[08:42.880 --> 08:45.800]  if you read the executive order it actually states they'll look at shutting
[08:45.800 --> 08:50.400]  it down but opening new camps in the United States for foreigners and US
[08:50.400 --> 08:54.600]  citizens without their rights and there are already two supermax prisons
[08:54.600 --> 09:00.200]  holding animal rights activist militia people others considered terrorists
[09:00.200 --> 09:05.320]  without due process and under the Patriot Act they're being held and now
[09:05.320 --> 09:11.360]  Obama is announcing a giant complex of these all over the United States run by
[09:11.360 --> 09:20.120]  the army so that is coming up today also we will go over this big bombshell
[09:20.120 --> 09:27.400]  bin Laden worked for us until 9-11 former FBI translator translating NSA
[09:27.400 --> 09:33.680]  intercepts Sybil Edmonds dropped a bombshell on Mike Malloy radio show in
[09:33.680 --> 09:38.320]  the interview Sybil Edmonds says that the US maintained intimate relations with
[09:38.320 --> 09:43.480]  bin Laden and the Taliban all the way up until the day of September 11th now they
[09:43.480 --> 09:49.080]  actually have them after and this was all staged but this is a big big bombshell
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.360]  and she told the 9-11 Commission this and their answer was to put an FBI gag on
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.200]  her and then start threatening to set her up and arrest her for other reasons
[09:58.200 --> 10:03.640]  then an army colonel and others inside the Pentagon came out and said this was
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.000]  all true and then the FBI was sicked on them and they would get arrested for
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.560]  things like a $68 phone bill on their army cell phone with calls for their
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.120]  wife that supposedly is authorized with saying they'd stolen from the Pentagon
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.600]  $68 I mean this is how you get white-gloved that's why I've said I
[10:24.600 --> 10:27.840]  could be set up anytime I don't commit any crimes other than speeding
[10:27.840 --> 10:34.920]  occasionally and I even been stopping that but it doesn't matter ladies and
[10:34.920 --> 10:39.840]  gentlemen it doesn't matter they can put you in I mean I've been researching the
[10:39.840 --> 10:44.960]  FBI lately they put the governor of Alabama in prison because Carl Rove
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.440]  ordered them to and it came out that they had witnesses lie on the stand he
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.400]  did nothing wrong all the witnesses have admitted it high-level Republican
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.840]  lobbyists have come out now from the White House meetings with Carl Rove and
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.800]  he just he had a consulting firm in Alabama he lives there most of the
[11:01.800 --> 11:08.880]  year as a seaside home and Carl Rove just said I want this other guy to win
[11:08.880 --> 11:13.240]  start indictments against him and they just completely it's it's all admitted
[11:13.240 --> 11:16.840]  now it's all been released the White House documents and no one gets in
[11:16.840 --> 11:22.880]  trouble I mean these people are just completely and totally criminal and I'm
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.720]  already going off down a side issue here with Sybil Evans but she has a lot
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.760]  of courage to be coming out and talking about this but I guess if I mean if
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.840]  they're gonna stage 9-11 attacks why not put governors in prison you don't like
[11:34.840 --> 11:41.040]  I mean why not engage in any level of tyranny so definitely pray for me folks
[11:41.040 --> 11:44.320]  because I'm gonna get a lot of threats and a lot of heat a lot of things have
[11:44.320 --> 11:48.160]  been happening and and they'll wrongfully arrest governors and put them in
[11:48.160 --> 11:54.120]  prison and then openly laugh about it I mean it's just totally criminal but so
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.760]  many other governors and US Attorney Generals and US attorneys and others
[11:59.760 --> 12:03.120]  have gone public and now the eyewitnesses have gone public they had to let him out
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.920]  of prison but he still spent two years in prison he was gonna be there for
[12:06.920 --> 12:11.640]  decades but so I guess the good news is they had to release him but I mean I
[12:11.640 --> 12:15.200]  mean if they'll frame governors and then they don't even get in trouble this
[12:15.200 --> 12:22.240]  country's gone and that's why they do this is so they can steal the 23.7
[12:22.240 --> 12:28.880]  trillion that they've stolen so far in 10 months from the US Treasury we have an
[12:28.880 --> 12:35.400]  armed gang of criminals running both parties at the top and Obama is
[12:35.400 --> 12:39.200]  continuing all these operations so that's some of the other news Obama
[12:39.200 --> 12:44.600]  considers military civilian prison system for suspected terrorist including
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.920]  US citizens according to the Associated Press also on the swine flu
[12:49.920 --> 12:57.920]  government swine flu czar to become ABC medical reporter US food bill HR 2749
[12:57.920 --> 13:04.360]  passes house on second try and this bill basically bans gardens farming will
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.800]  totally shut down family farms and ranches with regulations and control
[13:07.800 --> 13:12.040]  that the big agribusiness doesn't have to follow of course they lobbied for it
[13:12.040 --> 13:20.160]  that's why that's happened so we'll be going over some of that as well today and
[13:20.160 --> 13:26.920]  also dealing with the flu they're gonna pay US doctors an unspecified amount of
[13:26.920 --> 13:30.840]  money to participate in giving the experimental most doctors refuse deadly
[13:30.840 --> 13:42.280]  dangerous flu vaccine but the British newspapers are reporting today that
[13:42.280 --> 13:52.040]  they're gonna get 27,000 pounds 27,000 pounds or the equivalent of 50 plus
[13:52.040 --> 13:58.160]  thousand dollars in US money to carry out the inoculations including forced
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.320]  inoculations of the British people so how do they get them to carry out these
[14:02.320 --> 14:08.120]  criminal activities they just pay them bribe money so what I'm gonna do is I'm
[14:08.120 --> 14:12.640]  gonna take some of your calls first do things a little bit different today so
[14:12.640 --> 14:15.680]  you can chime in and comment on all the different things that are happening and
[14:15.680 --> 14:22.000]  then I'm gonna get into the swine flu and how that dovetails in with
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.960]  military to work with FEMA during swine flu pandemic Fox News and CNN both
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.320]  reporting that Homeland Security has told them the army will lock down entire
[14:31.320 --> 14:37.600]  cities cordon and quarantine entire populations enforceably inoculate door
[14:37.600 --> 14:45.840]  to door entire populations now remember back in January before the flu even
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.080]  broke out in April I was giving you the secret government documents and
[14:50.080 --> 14:55.560]  preparations for mass graves and army lockdowns of cities and so I said get
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.640]  ready for him to hype this up and they did that in April I'm not saying the
[14:59.640 --> 15:03.320]  flu is a real danger or that will have a real pandemic they already have us
[15:03.320 --> 15:07.400]  under a level six global pandemic right now with less than 2,000 dead worldwide
[15:07.400 --> 15:11.080]  less than 200 dead in the United States most people with serious medical
[15:11.080 --> 15:16.440]  complications the issue is why are they building all this up and I think the
[15:16.440 --> 15:21.400]  answer is because they knew as Joe Biden said in that speech that the approval
[15:21.400 --> 15:26.240]  rating was very very low would be very very low for Obama once people realize
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.320]  he was a liar six to ten months into his campaign into office and now his
[15:32.320 --> 15:35.560]  approval rating has dropped like a stone they're not gonna be able to get
[15:35.560 --> 15:38.120]  through all their police state activities and launch their new wars
[15:38.120 --> 15:42.800]  he's continuing the entire Bush agenda that agenda is the new orders agenda so
[15:42.800 --> 15:48.400]  they need a crisis a political crisis is a pretext to shut down and clamp down
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.960]  on our society and this flu fear-mongering certainly it now this
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.000]  may be another beta test coming up in the fall and winter for one in the future

[21:33.120 --> 21:44.120]  ever this far into their campaign this is serious serious serious news because
[21:44.120 --> 21:50.880]  the question is what are they going to try to pull they need him as their front

[25:59.880 --> 26:04.520]  Illinois Scott you're on the air hey Alex I actually had a couple of points
[26:04.520 --> 26:09.000]  the first is we met daily just came out with Obama's real birth certificate
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.640]  at least what I think is this real one yeah I meant to get to that that's that
[26:13.640 --> 26:17.640]  in fact let me hold that up on screen I meant to get to that well you go ahead
[26:17.640 --> 26:20.960]  and make your point that was in my stack and I gave it to the producer to try to
[26:20.960 --> 26:26.360]  get this is Alan Key's lawyer she's very credible we've looked into her
[26:26.360 --> 26:32.320]  California attorney Orly Teetz who has filed a number of lawsuits demanding
[26:32.320 --> 26:35.480]  proof of Barack Obama's eligibility to serve as president has released a copy
[26:35.480 --> 26:39.040]  of what purports to be the Kenyan certification of birth and has filed a
[26:39.040 --> 26:44.000]  new motion in US court for its authentication a curtain MO or Paul
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.320]  Watson to a story on this with the background right now the document list
[26:48.320 --> 26:53.040]  Obama's parents as Barack Hussein Obama and Stanley and Obama formerly Stanley
[26:53.040 --> 26:58.160]  and Dunham the birth date is August 4 61 in the hospital of birth is Coast
[26:58.160 --> 27:03.480]  General Hospital Mombasa Kenya folks if this is true see I'm so busy reading
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.280]  FEMA camp articles and government textbooks how they're drugging the water
[27:07.280 --> 27:12.840]  this is policy book implemented this has been implemented now drugging the water
[27:12.840 --> 27:18.680]  and I've got them oh civil Edmunds high-level see FBI translator coming out
[27:18.680 --> 27:23.080]  with with with al Qaeda run by the government running the attacks and I
[27:23.080 --> 27:27.320]  can't even and then and then I'm an idiot thank God I took your call is this
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.960]  really the smoking gun so I had another way to go out of me if he said he's a
[27:30.960 --> 27:35.960]  natural born US citizen then selective service should have a copy of his
[27:35.960 --> 27:42.240]  registration which every American male has to fill out when they get 18 I'll
[27:42.240 --> 27:46.920]  bet you a billion dollars there is no result there is a selective service
[27:46.920 --> 27:52.680]  registration form with his name on it it's another great point listen this
[27:52.680 --> 27:56.280]  whole birther thing I stayed out of it during the campaign because I didn't
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.440]  know if it was real or not but now that his approval ratings drop by about 40
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.960]  percent and people now don't because he lied about everything else and the fact
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.760]  that he had this very satirical name and lied about it and that was proven and I
[28:10.760 --> 28:16.440]  was on I go on big liberal news talkstations in Denver LA New York
[28:16.440 --> 28:21.240]  Dallas you know every week I go on these stations Miami and I mentioned Barry
[28:21.240 --> 28:25.760]  satirro and they say I'm a liar he didn't have that name then they search
[28:25.760 --> 28:29.320]  engine it and find out it's true and start freaking out we don't know who this
[28:29.320 --> 28:36.200]  guy is and and and this is probably very credible sir thank you so much for
[28:36.200 --> 28:39.640]  calling and reminding me of that that was something falling the cracks and so I
[28:39.640 --> 28:43.720]  kind of ignored this birther thing it's not in the Obama deception you know we
[28:43.720 --> 28:47.440]  cover all the things he's lied about who really handles him and controls him but

[34:05.240 --> 34:09.240]  pretext to crack down on the American people and look how they've used the
[34:09.240 --> 34:13.000]  Patriot Act against the American people tens of thousands of times look at how
[34:13.000 --> 34:19.400]  they have turned America into a police state look at how they have openly
[34:19.400 --> 34:25.240]  admitted that Homeland Security and North com are for gun owners and returning
[34:25.240 --> 34:31.240]  veterans and then the whole anti-terror apparatus is for the people
[34:31.240 --> 34:37.880]  this is really happening this is really going on ladies and gentlemen
[34:37.880 --> 34:41.640]  and world that daily is a very credible source
[34:41.640 --> 34:45.000]  they have broken so many huge stories over the years
[34:45.000 --> 34:50.440]  and Alan Key's lawyer is a prominent
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.720]  pundit on Fox and CNN and MSNBC over the years
[34:57.960 --> 35:01.400]  but we've got video clips of his lawyer up there talking about all this
[35:01.400 --> 35:05.080]  and we got big reports coming out in the next 30 minutes at info wars.com and
[35:05.080 --> 35:09.240]  prisonplanet.com we'll give you the whole backstory on this
[35:09.240 --> 35:13.080]  is this really the smoking gun of Obama's Kenyan birth certificate let's put
[35:13.080 --> 35:17.000]  that up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers
[35:17.000 --> 35:23.080]  they've got big blow-ups on the site certified copy of registration of birth
[35:23.080 --> 35:27.720]  coast province of Kenya the document lists Obama's parents is Barakusen
[35:27.720 --> 35:31.640]  Obama and Stanley and Obama formerly Stanley
[35:31.640 --> 35:36.040]  and Dunham the birth date is august 4th 1961
[35:36.040 --> 35:40.280]  and the hospital of birth at coast to general hospital is Mombasa Kenya
[35:40.280 --> 35:43.960]  and then people say oh well they wouldn't have a newspaper
[35:43.960 --> 35:47.640]  announcement a month later in the US
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.400]  you know what they think he was going to be president or something no
[35:51.400 --> 35:54.600]  if you're going to stage that your son was born in the US
[35:54.600 --> 35:58.760]  so he could be a US citizen and so he could get
[35:58.760 --> 36:02.760]  I mean if he was born out of the country he wouldn't get it
[36:02.760 --> 36:05.480]  there's only a few countries they recognize that with what England and
[36:05.480 --> 36:09.320]  Israel and a few others so a lot of families have been caught doing that
[36:09.320 --> 36:11.560]  with fake announcements in the newspaper and stuff
[36:11.560 --> 36:17.240]  that's standard procedure and he'll never release the blueprint original
[36:17.240 --> 36:21.720]  you know I have the blueprint original looks like a
[36:21.720 --> 36:25.960]  watermarked you know photocopy not a certificate
[36:25.960 --> 36:28.760]  and in the last five six years they stopped giving people copies of the
[36:28.760 --> 36:32.280]  original watermark because I've got three children
[36:32.280 --> 36:35.640]  and what you go down and do is get a certificate of live birth
[36:35.640 --> 36:39.480]  and they go each additional one is you know 10 $15 I forget exactly
[36:39.480 --> 36:43.000]  it's like 10 15 bucks and I go okay I'll take three copies per child
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.600]  because you need that you know with all the different you know systems to get
[36:46.600 --> 36:49.720]  passports and things so I'm getting my babies out of the country if things
[36:49.720 --> 36:52.600]  collapse too bad people are like why do you have a
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.880]  birth certificate it's it's better to be in the system and out of the
[36:55.880 --> 37:00.200]  system so you can have it both ways but you can argue about that all day
[37:00.200 --> 37:06.680]  the point here is that uh want to say hi to my babies by the way I know we're
[37:06.680 --> 37:09.800]  listening the document list obama's parents is
[37:09.800 --> 37:13.560]  barracusan obama and stanley and obama formerly staniel
[37:13.560 --> 37:19.400]  and dunham the birth date august 4th 61 at the hospital a birth of
[37:19.400 --> 37:23.480]  coast general hospital in mose mb kenya this is just incredible ladies and
[37:23.480 --> 37:26.200]  gentlemen I know I said I'd take calls but the caller
[37:26.200 --> 37:29.640]  pointed out to me that I'd forgotten to go with the top story because again I'm
[37:29.640 --> 37:35.000]  just I'm just immersed in huge news every day
[37:35.000 --> 37:39.960]  no doctor is listed but the alleged certificate bears the signature of the
[37:39.960 --> 37:44.760]  deputy register of coast province now dr corcy and others have gone to
[37:44.760 --> 37:49.800]  kenya and tried to get this they get arrested and held in house arrest when
[37:49.800 --> 37:53.080]  they try to go to the hospital and try to go interview his family and it's
[37:53.080 --> 37:56.680]  happened to a bunch of other reporters I mean you go to kenya
[37:56.680 --> 38:01.640]  you get followed around you get beat up you get arrested you get disappeared
[38:01.640 --> 38:05.800]  the doctor is listed but the alleged certificate bears the signature
[38:05.800 --> 38:10.840]  of the deputy register of the coast province joshua simon
[38:10.840 --> 38:15.000]  koya it was alleged issue as a certified copy of the original
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.840]  in february 64 so it's the same it's a certificate
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.120]  roll net daily is able to obtain other birth certificates from kenya
[38:24.120 --> 38:27.400]  for purposes of comparison in the form of the documents appear to be
[38:27.400 --> 38:31.240]  identical yeah that's the other issue the so-called
[38:31.240 --> 38:35.960]  certificate of live birth the certificate of the certificate that
[38:35.960 --> 38:38.760]  Obama uses experts have looked at it from
[38:38.760 --> 38:44.440]  Honolulu and it appears to be fake and I've compared myself
[38:44.440 --> 38:48.760]  this is really scary folks this is planned so they can
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.080]  create some constitutional crisis or riots or something I mean this
[38:53.080 --> 38:57.640]  everything about Obama is different and he did lie about being very satirical
[38:57.640 --> 39:01.640]  and go into muslim madrasas that's now all come out as documented
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.920]  I mean and I'm not saying you're bad if you're a muslim but don't lie about it
[39:06.920 --> 39:09.720]  last week a counterfeit document reporting to be obama's
[39:09.720 --> 39:12.680]  kenyan birth certificate made the rounds of the internet but was quickly
[39:12.680 --> 39:17.480]  determined to be fraudulent the new document released by
[39:17.480 --> 39:20.840]  tats bears none of the obvious traits of a hoax
[39:20.840 --> 39:25.640]  and see the establishment does that what did carl rove get caught doing
[39:25.640 --> 39:32.760]  back in texas politics whenever he wanted to burn a political
[39:32.760 --> 39:39.000]  opponent he engaged in releasing fake documents
[39:39.000 --> 39:44.600]  ahead of real documents coming out it's covered in the film bush's brain
[39:44.600 --> 39:48.120]  this is a classic tactic that if you know real documents are going to come out
[39:48.120 --> 39:51.320]  you muddy the water with other fake ones
[39:51.320 --> 39:54.760]  and again this whole thing could be an elaborate psi op it he could have been
[39:54.760 --> 39:59.560]  born in honolulu and and then it becomes a giant distraction
[39:59.560 --> 40:03.720]  from all the things he has lied about hiring nothing but lobbyist
[40:03.720 --> 40:08.840]  letting lobbyists write all the laws uh lying about how he wouldn't go after
[40:08.840 --> 40:12.760]  the second amendment lying about not raising taxes on people
[40:12.760 --> 40:19.080]  above 250 000 a year uh i mean just everything he said has been a lie
[40:19.080 --> 40:22.600]  and he's been caught in all these lies warrantless wiretapping he's continuing
[40:22.600 --> 40:28.200]  it he promised to punish bush for his crimes has blocked investigations
[40:28.200 --> 40:31.560]  he promised to end the patriot act he promised to end the secret arrest he's
[40:31.560 --> 40:36.120]  expanded it all to indefinite secret attention i mean you know
[40:36.120 --> 40:41.240]  that's why the obama deception the preeminent obama film out there
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.000]  tens of millions of views online for free on youtube and google
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.280]  that's why we don't cover the birther issue because
[40:48.280 --> 40:51.480]  it could be a honeypot but more and more of the way they act
[40:51.480 --> 40:56.840]  and how they won't release the original gets very very suspicious
[40:59.480 --> 41:03.640]  the motion filed by alan key's lawyer yesterday in u.s district court
[41:03.640 --> 41:07.480]  for the central district california request for reported evidence of obama's
[41:07.480 --> 41:11.080]  birth both the alleged birth certificate and foreign records not yet
[41:11.080 --> 41:13.720]  obtained be preserved from destruction
[41:13.720 --> 41:16.920]  asked for permission to legally request documents from kenya
[41:16.920 --> 41:21.960]  and seeks a supposed subpoena for deposition from secretary of state
[41:21.960 --> 41:27.160]  hillary clinton i filed the motion with the court asking for the
[41:27.160 --> 41:30.840]  expedited discovery which will allow me to start subpoenas and depositions even
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.080]  before obama and the government responds she told roland daily i am
[41:35.080 --> 41:38.120]  asking the judge to give me the power to subpoena
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.680]  the documents from kenyan embassy and to require a deposition from hillary
[41:42.680 --> 41:46.600]  clinton so that they will be forced to authenticate the birth certificate
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.120]  i am forcing the issue where obama will have to respond she said
[41:50.120 --> 41:52.600]  before
[41:53.320 --> 41:56.120]  they said you don't have anything backing up your claims
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.760]  the lawyer now said i have something in fact i have posted on the internet
[42:00.760 --> 42:04.520]  more than obama has my birth certificate
[42:04.520 --> 42:10.280]  actually has signatures and it goes on
[42:10.360 --> 42:15.560]  the lawyer uh celebrated a case involved a military officer major
[42:15.560 --> 42:18.920]  stefan cook whose order to deploy to afghanistan was revoked when he
[42:18.920 --> 42:23.240]  challenged obama's eligibility to hold office that case has now been
[42:23.240 --> 42:27.240]  refiled in federal court in florida raising the specter of a class action
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.240]  claim among members of the military that their orders aren't valid
[42:31.240 --> 42:34.600]  before questions surrounding obama's constitutional
[42:34.600 --> 42:38.760]  eligibility you know what colberg philberg the big
[42:38.760 --> 42:42.440]  former deputy attorney general there in pennsylvania

[48:23.320 --> 48:27.240]  you know six eight months before the election he's been asking this question
[48:27.240 --> 48:31.320]  and so he is the progenitor of all of this so on short notice
[48:31.320 --> 48:35.160]  we wanted to get him on for just five ten minutes to break down
[48:35.160 --> 48:38.360]  uh looking at this we know there have been other fake birth certificates put
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.360]  out from kenya this appears to be an orchestrated campaign
[48:42.360 --> 48:46.680]  to discredit things this may be real i don't know we've had dr corcy and others
[48:46.680 --> 48:50.200]  detained arrested in kenya when they're there trying to
[48:50.200 --> 48:54.200]  get the hospital records so there is a cover-up going on which is always
[48:54.200 --> 48:57.000]  evidence of somebody trying to hide something
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.240]  or generally is a philberg thanks for thanks for popping in sir
[49:01.240 --> 49:05.800]  my pleasure i really love to be on your show out hello to all your listeners
[49:05.800 --> 49:09.240]  um i've received this as many other people did today
[49:09.240 --> 49:14.120]  um you know if it's for real it's wonderful but the thing is it's been
[49:14.120 --> 49:18.200]  popped up there by orly tape and she spiraled it in her federal court case
[49:18.200 --> 49:21.960]  in california um i hope it's real if not i mean we've
[49:21.960 --> 49:25.960]  gotten some fake ones in the past and before we even put them out we always
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.800]  check them out there's some things on here which look questionable now
[49:29.800 --> 49:33.720]  we sent it on to our expert i haven't done that yet and i'm back to me yet
[49:33.720 --> 49:37.480]  but it at the top if you notice it's a registration
[49:37.480 --> 49:42.920]  doesn't say birth certificate it says um uh it chose the father of rock seniors
[49:42.920 --> 49:48.840]  address in hawaii uh i chose the date of registration at eight five sixty one
[49:48.840 --> 49:52.280]  that with the registration entered eight nine sixty one
[49:52.280 --> 49:56.200]  and we're wondering why it's not the same date also the signature of the
[49:56.200 --> 50:00.600]  registrar is rf lavender but assigned by someone else
[50:00.600 --> 50:04.920]  and then it has republic of kenya but kenya did not become independent till
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.120]  december 1963 and took effect in january 1964
[50:10.120 --> 50:13.880]  so it appears to be a bad fake on purpose
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.480]  to discredit everybody if you're right correct and again
[50:17.480 --> 50:20.600]  i you know i'm not trying to say it's a fake but i'm trying to say is
[50:20.600 --> 50:23.800]  we got to really check it out here because what's going to happen now is
[50:23.800 --> 50:27.800]  like she filed it as a federal document you know in a federal court case
[50:27.800 --> 50:31.560]  people are talking all over that this is the document and if it turns out to be
[50:31.560 --> 50:34.760]  a fake and it could have been put up there as you say
[50:34.760 --> 50:38.440]  by one of the quote non birthers because we're supposed to be birthed you know
[50:38.440 --> 50:43.240]  um it could be out there to discredit us and that's why i believe we have to be
[50:43.240 --> 50:46.280]  cautious i've been working on this now just about a year
[50:46.280 --> 50:49.480]  and i'm very cautious in what i say what i do
[50:49.480 --> 50:53.800]  um again i hope it's right i mean you know i don't see eye to eye with orly
[50:53.800 --> 50:57.000]  but if she did it god bless her you follow me because
[50:57.000 --> 51:00.360]  you know i'm so happy because uh i'm the first guy that came out of it with
[51:00.360 --> 51:04.760]  this back in august i filed the first lawsuit august 21st 2008 for your
[51:04.760 --> 51:07.240]  listeners and our website is the most up to date
[51:07.240 --> 51:11.160]  it's obama crimes dot com if i can say that opa ma
[51:11.160 --> 51:14.760]  absolutely in fact in fact phil we have obama crimes
[51:14.760 --> 51:17.640]  dot com up on screen right now as we simulcast
[51:17.640 --> 51:21.240]  at prison planet dot tv so yeah now now i don't
[51:21.240 --> 51:24.440]  you're always friendly you're always uh you know
[51:24.440 --> 51:28.920]  magnanimous and and and nice but this is an important investigation and i do
[51:28.920 --> 51:32.440]  believe you're credible and i know that you also represent a colonel
[51:32.440 --> 51:36.680]  uh who is uh you know standing up to obama right now demanding to see the
[51:36.680 --> 51:39.400]  evidence and you are the progenitor of this so
[51:39.400 --> 51:42.680]  it's important for us to know why you don't see eye to eye
[51:42.680 --> 51:46.600]  with orly tay um i don't know that that's a great
[51:46.600 --> 51:51.960]  point and and i don't know why orly came on the scene about late november 2008
[51:51.960 --> 51:55.640]  and we even spoke together at a press conference at the national press club in
[51:55.640 --> 52:02.200]  washington dc on december 8 2008 but it for some reason
[52:02.200 --> 52:06.440]  several months ago and and even if any of this is going to give logic to this it
[52:06.440 --> 52:10.200]  doesn't make sense several months ago she said she was going to take down phil
[52:10.200 --> 52:13.960]  burg and through that she's been attempting to do it through one of my
[52:13.960 --> 52:18.120]  volunteer assistant now why would you want to take down phil burg
[52:18.120 --> 52:21.320]  because i have you know and i'll talk to myself here and then you know i'm a
[52:21.320 --> 52:25.080]  straight shooter i have three pending cases in federal court
[52:25.080 --> 52:28.360]  one dealing with the standing issue which we now have that's now in the third
[52:28.360 --> 52:31.880]  circuit court of appeals and we now have a hearing date scheduled
[52:31.880 --> 52:37.240]  tentatively for argument on um october 26 you know they pushed it off but i got
[52:37.240 --> 52:40.680]  to bear with it the second case we're doing breeze on the holliser case
[52:40.680 --> 52:44.680]  which is the recent retired air force colonel who we found an inter pleader
[52:44.680 --> 52:47.960]  action and he wants to know he's on ready recall by the president
[52:47.960 --> 52:50.360]  he wants to know if he's called back to service
[52:50.360 --> 52:53.960]  does he follow the order because it's valid or can he disobey it because it's
[52:53.960 --> 52:57.400]  invalid because there's a phony or usurper in the
[52:57.400 --> 53:02.040]  office of president at third case which is pressing right now is uh... the deal
[53:02.040 --> 53:04.440]  under which i had found out and what field
[53:04.440 --> 53:08.440]  under the force claims act and the force claims act it's now unsealed because
[53:08.440 --> 53:12.200]  the judge dismissed it but we file a motion for reconsideration
[53:12.200 --> 53:15.960]  under theory of major conflict of interest by eric holder the attorney
[53:15.960 --> 53:20.200]  general of the united states and on that uh... we're taking a position
[53:20.200 --> 53:24.680]  that he refuses to prosecute obama and there's a conflict we're stating in
[53:24.680 --> 53:28.680]  there uh... because number one he was on obama's campaign committee
[53:28.680 --> 53:32.120]  number two he was one of three individuals who helped select by the
[53:32.120 --> 53:35.880]  vice president number three he's now attorney general of the united states
[53:35.880 --> 53:38.520]  which is the highest law enforcement person the country
[53:38.520 --> 53:42.200]  and he also gives advice to the president will fill out the conflict i
[53:42.200 --> 53:45.400]  don't know what it sure doubling back though
[53:45.400 --> 53:49.160]  i i mean i know you personally i've spoken at some events over the years and
[53:49.160 --> 53:52.760]  other issues with you uh... i don't know this other lady she seems
[53:52.760 --> 53:56.520]  credible i like alan keys
[53:56.520 --> 53:59.880]  uh... i mean i like all these people i like all these different lawyers okay
[53:59.880 --> 54:02.680]  but answer that question why would you want to take me down
[54:02.680 --> 54:06.200]  that's on branch in these cases is that a public statement oh absolutely it's
[54:06.200 --> 54:10.760]  about and and she's done it what she's done to my paralegal is unconscionable
[54:10.760 --> 54:13.880]  no i don't know okay well i mean i only brought this up
[54:13.880 --> 54:18.680]  sure because because this is obviously a highly charged political
[54:18.680 --> 54:22.360]  situation and i can imagine there's going to be dirty tricks and
[54:22.360 --> 54:25.000]  infiltration a lot of weirdness going on
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.720]  and i've noticed that just since i've been having you on and others on and
[54:29.720 --> 54:33.000]  even looking at this because i looked at it back during the campaign but looking
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.240]  at it again because the listeners are demanding it
[54:35.240 --> 54:38.840]  and i think they're you know their their response in the white house is
[54:38.840 --> 54:42.600]  very suspicious in the media is very suspicious suddenly all these big
[54:42.600 --> 54:47.240]  george soros and rockefeller funded think progress
[54:47.240 --> 54:53.640]  and uh... you know daily costs and all the big ones are coming after me
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.120]  really lying about me and saying unbelievably slanderous things
[54:58.120 --> 55:01.640]  and i've suddenly had the heat turned up in other ways we had some nice federal
[55:01.640 --> 55:05.480]  boys visit here friday uh... and i'm really starting to realize i think
[55:05.480 --> 55:09.320]  it's the birther thing that i'm noticing they're going after anybody and
[55:09.320 --> 55:11.400]  everybody that dare even speak about it
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.640]  why would they care so much about something if it was
[55:15.640 --> 55:19.720]  ballyhoo well because i think it hit on the head because it's not true
[55:19.720 --> 55:24.680]  you know i mean you know our our obama's is just not true we're on to something
[55:24.680 --> 55:28.200]  which i brought out first last year obama to me is one
[55:28.200 --> 55:30.760]  thousand not a hundred a thousand percent phony
[55:30.760 --> 55:35.800]  is the biggest hoax ever against the citizens of this country in 230 years
[55:35.800 --> 55:38.600]  it's outrageous that we've been talking about this because
[55:38.600 --> 55:41.720]  when it first came up before he was you know when he was running
[55:41.720 --> 55:45.480]  the news media should have asked him a question they didn't the media
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.720]  i wish i could do the national media because they didn't properly bet obama
[55:49.720 --> 55:52.760]  and i said that to a reporter last week for the day by the way you're a member
[55:52.760 --> 55:56.600]  of the aclu a big democrat yes sir and you've served a democratic

[56:18.360 --> 56:21.880]  they're going to try to discredit things with this information but in closing

[57:00.840 --> 57:04.360]  indonesia is my nationality and islam is my religion
[57:04.360 --> 57:07.400]  if he hasn't legally changed his name since then

[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:58.680]  well i think you just said it all they're not going to accept it
[1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:02.600]  so they're going to have flu outbreak pheromongering after flu outbreak
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:06.680]  pheromongering to train larger and larger percentages
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:09.880]  i mean if they announce it's the law go to your local sports stadium go to your
[1:02:09.880 --> 1:02:13.480]  local walmart all these places are going to be distribution points
[1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:17.480]  they've been training for decades probably 15 years that i've known of it
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.480]  for the fourth inoculation the model states health emergency powers acts in
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:26.200]  2002 they've intensified it now the last two years
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:30.520]  if you know if we thought it was intense they put on their afterburners
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:34.920]  now and so i've really been concerned but
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:38.520]  probably half the public right off the bat will follow orders and do it
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:42.840]  the other half won't and that's why i think the establishment
[1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:46.120]  and polls show that will probably release something really deadly in the
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:49.720]  future maybe this fall this winter maybe next year maybe five years from now
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:53.080]  whenever they think they're ready to really wipe out a lot of people
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:57.000]  and then they may even really have a vaccine that actually helps you
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.640]  and then that will set the precedent
[1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:05.160]  to get people to go along with the forced inoculation
[1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:09.240]  i mean they've gone from what 14 vaccines 20 years ago they wanted to
[1:03:09.240 --> 1:03:13.320]  force kids to take to over 60 now and they're approving new vaccines every
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:16.200]  year and then they engage in the mass hoax of saying
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:19.960]  it's the law you've got to take the vaccine when there is no law
[1:03:19.960 --> 1:03:24.600]  so their hoax isn't working of saying it's the law anymore
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:29.320]  and so now they're trying to set up a police state martial law type scenario
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:33.240]  where there's just martial law when it comes to medical issues
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:37.160]  of forcing people to take these shots then they tell the sheeple
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:42.120]  well if everybody would take the shot then you'd be protected but wait a
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.960]  minute if these idiots take the shots then they should be protected even if
[1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:49.880]  we haven't taken the shots so then they admit it's all
[1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:52.760]  over mainstream news top virologists are coming out
[1:03:52.760 --> 1:03:57.080]  an epidemiologist saying why on earth
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:01.240]  should people take the vaccine when it's already mutated everywhere
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:05.240]  hundreds of different mutations five new mutations i was reading in the
[1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:08.440]  austral american statesman last week in texas alone
[1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:13.400]  in the last week i mean it it's pointless even if you believe in vaccines
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:17.000]  and believe this vaccine is going to protect you and is good
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.280]  and that they're not putting something else in the vaccine which they talk
[1:04:20.280 --> 1:04:23.880]  about in the white house science are his own policy book
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:28.120]  putting sterilants in the vaccines even if you trust these people
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:33.960]  it doesn't protect you they admit it does that answer your question kyle
[1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:36.920]  well just one more quick thing you had said that
[1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:40.840]  about half the population would take it night and thinking
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:45.160]  wouldn't then people realize that you know the majority of them are dying and
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:47.640]  getting sick and then wouldn't want to continue on even
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:50.200]  and push back even harder it's a great point
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:04:54.520]  Gardasil has killed a bunch of girls they're still taking it
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:59.480]  because the media doesn't make a big deal out of it

[1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:38.120]  policies which are continuing everything bush did that was bad and
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:41.640]  expanding it and basically butchering the entire

[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:13.160]  the mainstream media reports it but like they're talking about
[1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:18.360]  some new pizza shop that opened up down the street or
[1:07:18.360 --> 1:07:25.400]  people's favorite uh you know coffee shop i mean i mean they're
[1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:29.000]  reporting it like it's no big deal and pedestrian and

[1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:04.040]  i just wanted to touch over a couple of our pieces of evidence that are

[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:41.240]  the show because i respect their research my issue is
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:44.760]  that this is a very large syndicated show not just an internet show
[1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:49.240]  we're in a lot of amon fm stations global fort wave satellite
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:52.440]  and i know there are a lot of groups out there naming names of scientists and
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:59.560]  doctors i can't do that okay this is a big national show i can't get away with
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:03.320]  things that other people can who don't have tens of millions of people
[1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:07.720]  looking at what they say and do now i did see a headline
[1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:15.480]  yesterday united nations says swine flu dangerous to take swine flu vaccine
[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:18.680]  and i can show a london telegraph headline where
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:22.840]  secret bird flu trials with unknowing public in europe
[1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:27.160]  killed huge amounts of people in some cases around a third of the people
[1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:31.160]  given the vaccine died and i could show you that
[1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:34.200]  headline and i and i can get up here and say
[1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:38.520]  garter still causes an autoimmune response and sterilizes many women
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:42.760]  and causes autoimmune diseases and has killed a bunch of people in the trials
[1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:46.280]  and is now killing large numbers of people and i can show you hundreds of
[1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:48.760]  local newscasts with the dead and dying women
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:52.520]  and and and and but see i can say that i can say
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.280]  bare knowingly put hiv and over a million shots
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:10:00.040]  that killed people because i can play msnbc and show ap
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:05.240]  see i can say incredibly and wild sounding stuff because it's true
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:09.800]  i can say fbi translator nsa interceptor said that been lied and worked for
[1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:13.880]  the cia because she's on record now breaking her
[1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:17.880]  gag order i can say the army is building fema camps
[1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:23.240]  because i'm at national guard dot com forward slash careers forward slash
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:27.080]  m o s forward slash description dot php
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:32.760]  question mark m o s underscore cod dot dot dot we haven't linked up on info
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:35.800]  wars dot com if you want to read it in the article army
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:39.880]  national guard advertises for internment specialist
[1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:45.480]  that is insanely incredible but it's real
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:47.880]  so
[1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:52.760]  number one i've had a lot of trouble over the years people calling up and saying
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:56.200]  what their name is their full name on air and then somebody else calls me saying
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:00.440]  that's not really me so we don't want listeners saying their
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:04.520]  last the first and last name on air and i don't want to sit here and list the
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:07.880]  names of doctors and people before i've had a chance to look at it
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:11.960]  okay thank you sir michael in canada michael
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:15.240]  you're on the air go ahead good day sir how are you
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:20.040]  good um so i want to talk about um one of my friends a good family friend
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:23.800]  actually just joined up with the kebek government and the health department
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:27.320]  who told us that people that we're going to get the injections i'm pretty sure
[1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:30.360]  you've talked about the fun of the word would have to find a waiver or a
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:33.240]  disclaimer saying that they would not kind of hold the pharmaceutical
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:37.240]  company is responsible for the ill effects caused by the h1n1 flu
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:40.280]  vaccine yeah that's because the last flu vaccine
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:44.040]  in 76 what that we know is a government psi op
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:47.240]  a sterilization op that's what it did it sterilized the men and women who took
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.880]  it many of them we know i mean 60 minutes even
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:54.040]  admits this that it killed people by the thousands and thousands injured tens
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.480]  of thousands brain damage tens of thousands i mean completely paralyzed
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:01.160]  or almost completely paralyzed all sorts of problems
[1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:05.480]  it broke out on a military base after an oculation that's admitted
[1:12:05.480 --> 1:12:09.080]  just like the flu that broke out in mexico happened after
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:13.640]  a test in oculation it's pretty clear that the companies are spreading this
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:16.520]  themselves it's pretty clear it's deadly and yes
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:20.440]  they want you to sign a waiver and on top of it they've already been given
[1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:25.080]  federal liability protection so i mean how would any and then they
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:27.960]  admit sir that it's already mutated a bunch of
[1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:30.760]  times and this vaccine won't even protect you
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:34.680]  but the idiots are lined up around the block to take last year's flu shot
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:38.920]  that has no protection well i find it absolutely disgusting
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:42.040]  um my friend they saw that there were red flags
[1:12:42.040 --> 1:12:44.120]  coming up each and every day that they were
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:46.920]  onto the computer and on the database red flags that were coming up on the
[1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:50.120]  each one and one swine flu saying that there were different problems with it
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:53.800]  but she couldn't access it because she doesn't have the authority within
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:57.000]  30 days of entering the department that's only when they give you the access
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.280]  to this she says within the next 30 days she's going to be able to gain access
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.680]  to it and tell us the real info what's going on
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:05.480]  and within those three days i will come back on the show and i will tell you
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:09.240]  what really is happening thank you god bless you sir call us then
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:13.720]  did you find the un announcement that i actually
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:16.360]  thought i printed that last night but it wasn't in my stack today when i
[1:13:16.360 --> 1:13:20.440]  stabled it i gotta get a new printer at my house i sit there printing stuff so i
[1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.760]  have it and then half the time it's not in there now
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.680]  i think it was on drudge the headline un says
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:32.440]  swine flu shot may be dangerous and uh
[1:13:32.440 --> 1:13:35.960]  then i saw a headline a few days ago about in the trials there's already
[1:13:35.960 --> 1:13:39.720]  really bad adverse reactions it's like they even admit what they're going to
[1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:44.040]  do to you united nation says flaunt swine flu
[1:13:44.040 --> 1:13:47.560]  vaccine may be harmful something like that i want to put the headline up
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:50.600]  it's all over the news click click news it'll be up
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:54.840]  let's cram in one more call i got time for that let's go ahead and take a call
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:58.280]  from jason in california jason go ahead
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:03.880]  hey alex i just had a comment um i know people are wondering why so many
[1:14:03.880 --> 1:14:08.280]  other people are making a big deal out of this swine flu the mainstream media
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:12.280]  when it's hardly killing anybody and i think that uh because initially they
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:15.720]  were planning on baxter getting it started but since that was
[1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:18.360]  supported they're going ahead with their propaganda to force
[1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:20.520]  vaccinate so that they can infect everyone through the
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:25.480]  vaccinations which have squalene in it which will pack a heavier punch
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:28.760]  and uh when that's spreading like wildfire they'll be protected against
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:31.240]  litigation and free to make their billions while they
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:35.080]  carry out nasty popularization i just wanted everyone to read the
[1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:39.240]  article on prison planet planet dot com that's titled new evidence that the
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:43.000]  swine flu pandemic is man-made it lays it all out perfectly
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.720]  uh in sequence and it has all the proof there
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:48.680]  i just thought it's uh real important if people remember they got coffins and
[1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:53.960]  body bags waiting and uh read that article thank you sir god bless you

[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:29.720]  this fits in with all the other evidence i have
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:35.320]  fema camps how they're going to use or preparing to use unless we expose it
[1:20:35.320 --> 1:20:39.640]  this whole flu fear mongering in the fall and winter for physical martial law
[1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:43.480]  that is really being set up and pushed
[1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:46.600]  and the mainstream media is acclimating and preparing the public
[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:52.200]  right now but right now let's go to uh samson in alabama

[1:21:05.400 --> 1:21:08.600]  fires and i have a friend that um is in we are
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:11.560]  changed i um what i did was i went around all the
[1:21:11.560 --> 1:21:14.600]  businesses in my city and i was handing them out
[1:21:14.600 --> 1:21:19.160]  then i went up on a public highway i was on the side of the sidewalk it's public
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:23.240]  property and i was handing them out and the
[1:21:23.240 --> 1:21:27.240]  walmart that was way way way away from me
[1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:31.080]  to their security agents come up to me they called the police
[1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:34.520]  and the chief of police came out and they came out
[1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:38.680]  and they were they were harassing me and they made me leave
[1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:43.960]  they made me leave public property um i had like four or five people out there
[1:21:43.960 --> 1:21:47.080]  all surrounding me harassing me just because i was handing out
[1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:50.840]  fires and holding up a sign saying nine level is the inside job on public
[1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:53.400]  property well well let me break this down
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:57.720]  let me break this down the kansas city star a few months ago and it's
[1:21:57.720 --> 1:22:01.880]  going to be in the new obama film i'm making
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:06.920]  my guys were at a city park on record city park
[1:22:06.920 --> 1:22:10.520]  they were out actually on the front sidewalk off a major road
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:14.120]  videotaping the federal reserve they wanted a far away shot
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:18.760]  and security guards off the federal property come over with guns and say
[1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:22.840]  we're going to take you to jail if you don't leave
[1:22:22.840 --> 1:22:25.400]  and and and my guys said well you don't have the authority to do that they
[1:22:25.400 --> 1:22:29.960]  said well watch us we're going to and the newspaper made a big deal out of
[1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:33.640]  it the federal reserve lied and denied it in the paper and said we never did
[1:22:33.640 --> 1:22:38.040]  that they're all on video now my guys
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:42.040]  hold on just a second my guys could have gone to jail
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:46.120]  sued and won and made a big deal out of it but instead they had the video
[1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:49.640]  and that showed the tyranny now in a lot of areas
[1:22:49.640 --> 1:22:54.040]  the police run over and asked for the fliers and want obama deceptions and
[1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:58.840]  are supportive in other areas they're neutral
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:02.200]  but uphold the first amendment the first amendment to the nation the most
[1:23:02.200 --> 1:23:05.720]  important thing there is without that where the soviet union or nazi germany
[1:23:05.720 --> 1:23:08.920]  but yes we've had ron paul supporters on in south carolina
[1:23:08.920 --> 1:23:13.560]  this was in the news where they were the cops busted down their door
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:17.080]  beat them up and took them to jail for a ron paul sign
[1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:21.560]  it's happened to other people that some of the police are completely out of
[1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:25.320]  their minds and nuts and believe the dhs report saying that's
[1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:28.440]  terrorist material the feds are teaching them that some of these guys
[1:23:28.440 --> 1:23:31.480]  literally have like 75 iqs and their own power trips
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:38.440]  me cop you slave and so um what they did was criminal
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:40.920]  and you should file a complaint i know the police sheet was involved you should
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:45.480]  go to city council file an official oppression violation of your first
[1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:49.000]  amendment and you should just go ahead and follow the suit they can beat the
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.880]  rap but not the ride and you can even follow the federal
[1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:55.080]  suit yourself and that'll make them answer for it and then after you follow
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:58.760]  the suit you go back out there with witnesses and video cameras
[1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:02.040]  and then let them drive you off let them violate your rights let them threaten
[1:24:02.040 --> 1:24:05.480]  even act afraid at the end and they'll you because you are entrapping them but
[1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:09.080]  they're they're criminals and they will maybe even assault you it you know out
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:11.640]  of their oh god i'm driving you know they may go
[1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:15.480]  ahead and slap you or something and then laugh like soviet thugs
[1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:18.440]  but now you've got them and it's not really entrapping them that you know
[1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:21.320]  they're the ones doing wrong then you put that on youtube
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:25.960]  then it'll become a national issue or or better yet have a hidden camera on you
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:29.960]  but have a witness as well and uh this is how you beat them so
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:33.720]  did they celebrate when they when they struck another nail in the coffin of
[1:24:33.720 --> 1:24:38.920]  america and the founding father's heart when they drove you off of the sidewalk
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:42.760]  well what it was was the let the there was two of those
[1:24:42.760 --> 1:24:45.560]  you know those private security guards for walmart
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:50.200]  they um they were just driving around and what was really odd was none of them
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:53.320]  would give me their badge numbers nothing i ask i was trying to figure out who
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:57.560]  they were it's called secret police the chief of police
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:01.800]  himself came down there um and i was they just would give me their last name
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:05.240]  i have a video on my website at true redemption dot net and
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:10.040]  i asked them like what is it what is it what is your last name
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:13.080]  i didn't have much of a video because i just had my cell phone camera and i
[1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:16.440]  didn't get much of it because they would tell me not to record them and
[1:25:16.440 --> 1:25:19.160]  stuff because they're gods yeah yeah they're gods
[1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:23.240]  they're gonna put cameras on us all day and surveil everything and
[1:25:23.240 --> 1:25:27.320]  listen i appreciate your call sir um
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:31.320]  we checked this out punch it up on screen for me glenbeck government
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:36.360]  website cards dot gov takes over your computer forever
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:40.760]  and we posted this saturday and we were getting emails and comments
[1:25:40.760 --> 1:25:45.800]  saying glenbeck's a liar it's not real and i don't blame you glenbeck lied and
[1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:48.280]  said there are no fema camps when it's all admitted in
[1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:54.440]  new york times washington post used in chronicle
[1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:58.440]  no yeah yeah that's the that's the actual cars
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:05.800]  screenshot and people are on there saying the website doesn't really say
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:08.680]  this well as of last night we went and checked and
[1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:11.800]  it's there and it was there today when i look you may not just be looking on the
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:14.440]  website right when you get ready to log on to the cars
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:21.880]  dot gov site to to see about if your car is eligible to trade it in
[1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:28.040]  it reads that it is taking your computer over
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:33.000]  and you say why are you bringing this up now
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:37.160]  well my point is they are surveying they are
[1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:41.160]  surveilling us every day in every way totally violate the
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:44.840]  moral rights and constitution but then if you try to videotape cops coming up
[1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:48.040]  and getting in your face they tell you don't have a right to do it but it's
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:53.000]  all color of law it's all criminal but you better watch it
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:56.040]  because if they'll put innocent governors in prison
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:59.320]  like the alabama governor it's now been proven and declassified
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:02.040]  he was completely innocent the white house said put him in jail
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:06.520]  the fbi did it you better know the government means business ladies and
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:09.960]  gentlemen and so i'm not telling you when they

[1:32:09.880 --> 1:32:14.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:17.720]  company allows you to have it's true total government control
[1:32:17.720 --> 1:32:20.840]  of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:24.520]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:27.400]  overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:32:27.400 --> 1:32:30.920]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:34.040]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related
[1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:37.160]  outages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:32:37.160 --> 1:32:40.680]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[1:32:40.680 --> 1:32:43.480]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:51.560]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:55.880]  remember the government doesn't own the sun yet so go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:32:55.880 --> 1:33:11.800]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365
[1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:15.560]  all right folks we are back live i found that headline
[1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:19.560]  ruling allowing taser used to get dna maybe nations
[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:24.360]  first this is out of the buffalo news we'll put it up on screen for prison
[1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:27.480]  planet dot tv viewers the radio listeners can just google
[1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:32.360]  ruling allowing taser use to get dna maybe nations first
[1:33:32.360 --> 1:33:37.560]  and uh this was in june 4 2009 but i first saw this six seven years ago in
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:41.400]  miami where the police taser you if you don't
[1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:45.240]  urinate in a cup immediately now that's torture they call it paying
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:49.160]  compliance and it says smith was handcuffed and sitting
[1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:51.800]  on the floor of an agri-false police headquarters
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:55.560]  when he was zapped with 50 000 volt electronic
[1:33:55.560 --> 1:33:59.880]  electric stun gun after he insisted he would not give a dna sample
[1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:03.240]  they wanted him to open his mouth he already had given a sample
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:06.920]  a swab on the inside of his cheek without protest the previous month
[1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:10.280]  the police sent it to the wrong lab where it was opened and spoiled
[1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:14.280]  prosecutors who obtained a court order for the first sample went back
[1:34:14.280 --> 1:34:17.720]  so so they knowingly did this and they say yes
[1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:21.560]  if you don't open your mouth and and see next it's if you don't do jumping jacks
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:26.440]  or you don't clean the dishes right and i've got video i've shown it here on
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:31.560]  air uh it's in my film martial law where they take
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:35.720]  christians arms who were just sitting blocking a sidewalk and they say get up
[1:34:35.720 --> 1:34:39.160]  and they go no so they take num chucks and twist until the arm breaks
[1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:43.080]  bone sticks out and the federal judges ruled you can break
[1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:48.040]  people's arms with compound fractures they don't just do it at abu gaib
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:52.600]  this is for us the slaves in fact the air force said two years ago they said
[1:34:52.600 --> 1:34:57.320]  we're using microwave guns in iraq but to get around the
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:00.520]  geneva convention we want to use it on our people first
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:05.160]  and just name it and say it's humane in fact google that people won't believe me
[1:35:05.160 --> 1:35:10.200]  um air force head of air force says use microwave
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:14.920]  guns on americans first see i mean it's all documented
[1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:18.280]  um now i want to continue with some of your calls but
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:22.280]  let me just blitz through some news first um this is a big deal because
[1:35:22.280 --> 1:35:27.400]  this already happens i've got a it guys that work here two full-time it guys
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:31.480]  and we've noticed that when we go to winehouse.gov to get documents or photos
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:35.560]  or executive orders that the computer slows down
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:39.560]  and then you go look it's not just cookies or things they take over your
[1:35:39.560 --> 1:35:42.360]  computers they have the nsa jump in and start
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:46.360]  downloading everything basically it's all criminal it's all a violation of the
[1:35:46.360 --> 1:35:49.400]  fourth amendment you know they had all the big freakouts are they
[1:35:49.400 --> 1:35:52.840]  listening to your phones or not then it turned out that the entire phone

[1:35:56.040 --> 1:35:59.080]  warrants it's a criminal rogue group and they do
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:03.880]  this to control and and dominate the public
[1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:10.680]  but this is from cars.gov which is killing all the used car people
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:15.560]  you know now you get $3,500 if you go buy something new and and turn in your
[1:36:15.560 --> 1:36:19.880]  good car just a load of bull they take my tax
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:23.320]  money to give it to people to get rid of their
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:27.080]  their car i mean this government's completely criminal
[1:36:27.080 --> 1:36:33.720]  total total socialism total communism this application provides access to the
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:39.160]  dot car system when logged on to the car system your

[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:23.000]  and the public is in denial
[1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:28.200]  you know that's what's so dangerous about glenn beck he does a lot of good
[1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:31.960]  stuff on his show i would love to like him but then he goes on and says
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:36.760]  911 truthers or terrorists that want to kill you the dot report the department
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:41.480]  of justice reports saying you know gun owners or terrorist is good
[1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:44.280]  you know there aren't any fema camps when the when the national guard is
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:48.200]  admitting there's fema camps but here's a minute of this report

[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:49.240]  from what i call a constitutional watchdog i'm asking my radio listeners
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:54.360]  earlier this week to watch these things because 10 million eyes on radio and
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:38:56.760]  god knows how many millions of eyes here on television
[1:38:56.760 --> 1:39:00.840]  watching things that we can't watch this is a frightening

[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:22.360]  certificate from kenya supposedly showing he was born there so we're
[1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:25.400]  we're looking at that right now and we have one of the attorneys on earlier
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:29.160]  saying this may not be accurate so we're just seeing if there's
[1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:34.760]  something to this um but we did go check out the situation with
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.240]  the cars dot gov it is true and it immediately starts
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:45.000]  seizing control of your computer so and they've already said for file sharing
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.080]  that the government without judge jury or anything if they think you downloaded

[1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:20.680]  shell empty hillsides and the taliban and al qaeda would kidnap
[1:52:20.680 --> 1:52:25.080]  12 13 14 year olds and stick them in foxholes and it turned out the army
[1:52:25.080 --> 1:52:30.680]  was coordinating at high level general and above level general

[1:52:43.080 --> 1:52:47.480]  major cities and they flew the 6000 taliban and al qaeda out to safety
[1:52:47.480 --> 1:52:51.640]  paid them in gold bars protected them special forces occasionally would
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:52:55.240]  capture them they'd be ordered to release them that's mainstream news just all

[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:02.200]  and then the government said we accidentally flew out al qaeda
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:10.040]  and and and and a few months ago nbc was sitting there yelling
[1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:13.720]  at the pakistani president saying why do you support al qaeda and the guy laughed
[1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:17.880]  and said you run al qaeda you you have them trying to overthrow our
[1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:25.720]  government right now which is but see that's so bold to be running al qaeda
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:31.160]  but that's to use a child's analogy emperor palpatine became emperor in
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:36.440]  star wars by staging attacks against himself
[1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:39.480]  now that's been declassified the pentagon does this all over the world
[1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:43.320]  that's why george lucas admitted it cans when they came out with episode three
