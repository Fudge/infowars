[00:00.000 --> 00:13.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:13.400 --> 00:27.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well a lot of you know him
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.500]  from Jesse Ventura's top rated show on true TV I recommended him for the research episode
[00:33.500 --> 00:40.920]  secret societies global death plot and I believe that's his maiden voyage on national television
[00:40.920 --> 00:46.400]  and it's his first time joining us here on the radio for this hour perhaps a little bit in the
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.400]  next hour we're gonna be playing key audio clips that he recorded at conferences he attended and
[00:51.400 --> 00:55.960]  put on he was the head of many of these high-powered conferences with Rothschild's
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.440]  Rockefellers Maury Strong and so joining us is George Washington Hunt served as a naval officer
[01:03.440 --> 01:10.600]  consultant to major companies headed up with the World Conservation Society's World Conservation Bank
[01:10.600 --> 01:16.360]  was a big part of that working with the United Nations he's done so much out of the gates here
[01:16.360 --> 01:24.160]  I just want Mr. Hunt to give us a nutshell overview a thumbnail sketch of himself how
[01:24.160 --> 01:28.200]  he got involved with these groups then how he woke up to what they were really doing not
[01:28.200 --> 01:32.960]  just in their speeches but the on-the-side meetings and discussions of the establishment of
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.080]  world government through phony environmentalism so George Hunt it's great to have you here with
[01:38.080 --> 01:46.280]  us today I'm glad to be here Alex every chance I get to spread the bad news that's my job well
[01:46.280 --> 01:54.880]  you know people sometimes so I went to the fourth world wilderness Congress at September 11th 1987
[01:54.880 --> 02:03.040]  I went there because my son had been killed in a wilderness area the later part of the of the
[02:03.040 --> 02:12.080]  year or about a few months before and I was very very sad and also my other son that was still
[02:12.080 --> 02:19.640]  living said he wanted to repair huts along the Arctic for travelers and he wanted to get into a
[02:19.640 --> 02:25.640]  job so I heard the fourth world wilderness coming to town and with all its reindeer and pretty
[02:25.640 --> 02:30.920]  little bright lights and I said you know maybe I could go there and rub the shoulders with the
[02:30.920 --> 02:37.760]  smokies with the forest rangers and get my son a job and so I went down to the Congress and I saw
[02:37.760 --> 02:44.080]  the pictures of the reindeer and so on but then I noticed on the program that there was another
[02:44.080 --> 02:50.760]  aspect away from Denver she had the first two days of this wilderness convention Congress
[02:50.760 --> 02:58.760]  supposed to be pro conservation the first two days were in Denver and then they moved a quasi
[02:58.760 --> 03:10.920]  secret meeting up to the YMCA of of Estes Park Colorado so with my resourceful mind I said to
[03:10.920 --> 03:18.440]  myself I'd like to get into that Congress but I didn't have any money and then lo and behold I
[03:18.440 --> 03:25.760]  got the information that one of the special official host of the meeting but it was ill with
[03:25.760 --> 03:33.880]  the flu I got his number I called him he says yeah take my place I was interviewed by about four
[03:33.880 --> 03:41.840]  four people among among them were psychics and they approved me as an official host and that
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.080]  shows how weird these groups are because morey strong also has a wilderness retreat like Bohemian
[03:47.080 --> 03:52.200]  groves similar where they admittedly do a lot of bizarre activities so so everywhere they go
[03:52.200 --> 03:59.000]  there's always psychics and the occult involved yes well they were involved here too Alex they all
[03:59.000 --> 04:11.000]  run together the psychics the occult the witches the devils the the the near-rich that want to
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.520]  get into the crowd it's a whole mish-mash and there's video of this that you shot I mean over
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.080]  time you became the leader of the conferences and we're going to get into that how these twists
[04:21.080 --> 04:26.320]  of fate got you in this position so we're going to break in a moment let's come back with George
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.720]  Hunt goes he wants to spot at this event this conservation event you end up getting one of
[04:32.720 --> 04:38.560]  the places of one of the host and then suddenly you're with Rothschild's Rockefellers how did
[04:38.560 --> 04:45.120]  this happen you're approved by psychics to be able to go by them I mean it just goes on and on
[04:45.120 --> 04:52.240]  and on and I've done separate research from George Hunt confirming what he said about morey strong
[04:52.240 --> 04:57.880]  and others they want a one-world religion as Al Gore is now openly saying we'll be right back with
[04:57.880 --> 05:02.880]  George Hunt this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[05:02.880 --> 05:07.840]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[05:07.840 --> 05:13.200]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[05:13.200 --> 05:18.720]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[05:18.720 --> 05:24.280]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[05:24.280 --> 05:30.000]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.440]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[05:34.440 --> 05:40.200]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[05:40.200 --> 05:44.280]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest
[05:44.280 --> 05:51.480]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember
[05:51.480 --> 05:58.560]  the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[05:58.560 --> 06:07.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[06:07.920 --> 06:13.120]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[06:13.120 --> 06:19.360]  the Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[06:19.360 --> 06:25.520]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[06:25.520 --> 06:31.840]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on
[06:31.840 --> 06:37.120]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke
[06:37.120 --> 06:41.920]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the checkout to
[06:41.920 --> 06:48.960]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic
[06:48.960 --> 06:55.840]  yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching online right now

[08:00.600 --> 08:05.640]  he's set to meet the man who pulls together all the threats george hunt
[08:09.640 --> 08:15.720]  it's not truly really about saving the planet from carbon dioxide it's about making money
[08:15.720 --> 08:21.480]  not at an international level we're not even talking here about country country country
[08:21.480 --> 08:28.680]  we're talking about a global type money making thing correct yes we're talking about a powerful
[08:28.680 --> 08:37.320]  immense aristocracy that is that has the intention of using the fear of the environment
[08:37.320 --> 08:46.280]  uh deteriorating they're going to use it to take over the world george hunt was an
[08:46.280 --> 08:52.360]  official at the world wilderness congress when he met morris strong in 1987 the congress is an
[08:52.360 --> 08:58.840]  international forum for discussing the environment but morris strong showed up to introduce a new
[08:58.840 --> 09:06.040]  player financier edmund a Rothschild of the rothschild banking dynasty and a proposal to create
[09:06.040 --> 09:15.160]  something called a world conservation bank one of the most important initiatives that is open here
[09:15.720 --> 09:22.280]  is that of the conservation banking program we have is our chairman fortunately the person
[09:22.280 --> 09:29.720]  who epitomizes that positive synthesis between environment conservation on the one hand and
[09:29.720 --> 09:36.440]  economics on the other and i'm just delighted to have this opportunity of introducing to you
[09:36.440 --> 09:46.200]  edmund the rothschild morris strong was in charge of the conservation movement but he was also
[09:46.840 --> 09:54.600]  edmund the rothschild's right hand man you have money and the environment in one person
[09:54.600 --> 09:59.720]  edmund the rothschild now morris strong i found out during
[10:03.800 --> 10:07.720]  okay ladies and gentlemen we're back live the rest of the hour a little bit in the next hour
[10:08.680 --> 10:15.880]  george hunt is our guest to go in depth so he's just looking into conservation jobs for his son
[10:17.480 --> 10:23.800]  uh one of the presenters is sick he says i'd like to go suddenly he's being vetted by them
[10:23.800 --> 10:30.520]  by psychics and from my separate research is on record morris strong has a weird cult compound
[10:30.520 --> 10:35.480]  in colorata it ties into bohemian grove the u n of course is into the occult he brought that up
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.720]  that's coming up later okay going back to george hunt naval officer corporate businessman
[10:43.240 --> 10:47.880]  you know successful he gets involved in this and over the next few years going to these events
[10:47.880 --> 10:53.560]  and it turns out sharing some of them he finds out what's really going on so continue with
[10:53.560 --> 11:00.440]  you get into this first semi-secret uh you know closed door meeting in colorata continue from
[11:00.440 --> 11:07.480]  there george hunt yes i had luncheon with the rothschild's they were very nice people
[11:08.360 --> 11:14.440]  lady rothschild stood up when i when i came to the table and she filled my glass and suddenly
[11:14.440 --> 11:20.040]  i said that thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies my cup runneth over
[11:20.040 --> 11:28.040]  her and i was with the president of the world conservation bank and i said uh michael uh
[11:28.040 --> 11:36.520]  sweetman how is this bank going to survive if the asset base is arctic lands they don't produce
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.760]  any dividends and interest he says oh we are worried we are working on that he said in his
[11:43.560 --> 11:49.640]  precise english i said you're working on it and you're going to have a a seminar and a half an
[11:49.640 --> 11:56.440]  hour where you're going to accept this bank what's going on michael he said you'll have a chance to
[11:56.440 --> 12:02.040]  to ask to set the at the seminar i i looked him in the eyes said michael are you going to call on me
[12:02.040 --> 12:07.160]  look me in the eye michael yes i promise well when we went to the seminar and of course he
[12:07.160 --> 12:14.120]  didn't call on me it was a contrived congress and they accepted the bank and we haven't seen it yet
[12:14.120 --> 12:20.680]  but it's coming down the road because there'll be one bank one credit card one of everything
[12:20.680 --> 12:26.760]  and if you cross that bank and don't do what they want or the owner's one you'll lose your credit
[12:26.760 --> 12:34.120]  card privilege and you won't be able to buy or sell now let's fast forward 24 years or 23 years to
[12:34.120 --> 12:42.200]  2010 i now have london guardian associated press headlines roth child's established global environment
[12:42.200 --> 12:48.200]  bank roth child's established global carbon credit bank it's now mainstream news what you whistle
[12:48.200 --> 12:53.400]  blew on decades ago after you got deeper into the groups we're going to cover that that they were
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.920]  going to establish all this and everything you said of course you also released the documents and
[12:58.920 --> 13:04.040]  video and audio but everything you talked about was going to happen is now actually happening
[13:04.600 --> 13:11.160]  yes that's what i want people to wake up at this is a conspiracy going on it's no longer a
[13:11.160 --> 13:17.800]  conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy fact okay so continue so you're at the meeting you're at the
[13:17.800 --> 13:23.640]  table with the roth child's because by twist of fate you got the ticket or the seat of one of the
[13:23.640 --> 13:33.720]  presenters who had the flu go ahead then i then my fellow uh uh uh fellow workers came up to me and
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.520]  and they said george we have to talk to you about something david rockefeller has sent a
[13:38.520 --> 13:44.360]  message that if you don't keep your mouth shut you're going to regret it shortly after that
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.120]  after the meeting i was talking with a top show host and he said did you get geane bar
[13:50.120 --> 13:55.800]  syndrome yet and i said what are you talking about he said gbs it seems like everyone that
[13:55.800 --> 14:01.640]  gets close to the bone with world order gets it well i just got out of the hospital with gbs
[14:01.640 --> 14:07.480]  so there is something there don't you think oh we know they have a lot of programs with soft kill
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.760]  weapons but but expanding on this because you got the video out of there at other events so out of
[14:12.760 --> 14:19.240]  the gate so i got the tape of the event as far as i know it's the only tape in existence and i've
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.280]  seen video of them presenting audio them presenting so so it looks like out of the gates and correct
[14:24.280 --> 14:29.320]  me if i'm wrong you were confrontational with them immediately maybe that's why they kept you
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.520]  around for a while trying to get control of you worried that you'd gotten into a secret meeting
[14:34.520 --> 14:38.920]  that you weren't supposed to be part of or why didn't they kick you out why did you get invited
[14:38.920 --> 14:46.440]  to more meetings i can't i can't figure that out uh first of all i hadn't done anything wrong though
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.560]  i was an official host and i so why was david rockefeller telling you to shut up the people
[14:51.560 --> 14:58.440]  why was our regular uh regular uh association with morris strong there
[14:58.440 --> 15:05.960]  now then after the congress i went down uh some christians down in san luis valley called me
[15:05.960 --> 15:10.280]  they said george you have to come down here morris strong is up to all kinds of trips
[15:10.920 --> 15:17.400]  and that's where i was able to through them expose morris strong's water scan that he
[15:17.400 --> 15:24.120]  was going to pump water to cities and turn the san luis valley thousands of miles into a dust
[15:24.120 --> 15:33.640]  bolt so here's the the convener of the environment congress that met in estus park going down 200
[15:33.640 --> 15:40.360]  miles to the san luis valley and turning the place into a dust bolt it was that hypocrisy
[15:40.360 --> 15:49.160]  that caused me to invest up to now 250 000 in exposing this guy and i've got some information
[15:49.160 --> 15:54.040]  today for you that uh it's going to blow him out of the water
[15:57.640 --> 16:03.160]  amazing so so again now we see it all over the news how the un and big corporations are
[16:03.160 --> 16:07.720]  grabbing up the water in the third world the first world developing world cutting it off
[16:07.720 --> 16:13.960]  that's now mainstream news here you are in the late 80s seeing this at its embryonic formation
[16:13.960 --> 16:19.240]  yes i saw it as an embryo and now i'm seeing this at ugly fetus
[16:21.400 --> 16:26.840]  now from the videos and audios i've seen of you uh you you then found out about this well
[16:26.840 --> 16:31.320]  we'll continue with that first conference what they said we've got a bunch of audio clips here
[16:31.320 --> 16:39.640]  and then but but continue into other meetings that you were able to infiltrate oh i i've infiltrated
[16:39.640 --> 16:45.800]  many meetings but not one of of this importance because the secretary of the treasury baker was
[16:45.800 --> 16:52.360]  there the head of the imf the head of the world bank ross child edmund ross child the chief
[16:52.360 --> 16:58.920]  banker of the world uh david rockefeller da da da da and i knew there was something going on it
[16:58.920 --> 17:04.440]  would take an idiot not to understand it and again your own record is being part of the
[17:04.440 --> 17:09.960]  conference you got the document sound uh later newspapers major newspapers have written stories
[17:09.960 --> 17:16.920]  about it on the major tv show they showed those i mean this was a stroke of uh divine intervention
[17:17.640 --> 17:23.800]  it was god it was what you call an incident coincidence because i received a prophecy in
[17:23.800 --> 17:30.360]  the christian church about 12 years earlier that i was going to do this so it was it was a piece of
[17:30.360 --> 17:36.120]  cake i walked through it without any fear and knowing that god was on my side wait a minute so
[17:36.120 --> 17:41.560]  someone told you specifically or did you recognize what was happening as it was happening or did you
[17:41.560 --> 17:48.200]  like after the fact go oh my god it was later after the fact this is a prophecy we are going
[17:48.200 --> 17:55.320]  into the wilderness we are going on an adventure together into the wilderness uh i am going to
[17:55.320 --> 18:02.520]  loose you up on the ravenous beast of the world and then you will return to me and i will protect
[18:02.520 --> 18:08.920]  you you i am your jailer for your good and mine and that was the prophecy and then after i went to
[18:08.920 --> 18:15.160]  the wilderness congress i realized i had been in the wilderness and he was loosening me up on the
[18:15.160 --> 18:21.400]  ravenous beast of the world i knew them face to face amazing now now let's go back to this meeting
[18:21.400 --> 18:26.600]  though this key meeting you got into then you went and witnessed their sub meetings so go over
[18:26.600 --> 18:35.480]  again the date the time the place and who was there okay david rockfeller edmund ross child
[18:36.200 --> 18:41.960]  secretary of the treasury baker head of the imf don't remember his name head of the world bank
[18:41.960 --> 18:50.440]  uh the head of the united nations in cheneva i had dinner with him one night uh he kind of found
[18:50.440 --> 18:57.560]  out that my questions were a little too close to the vote uh then there were the smokies were there
[18:57.560 --> 19:03.880]  all the all the forest rangers uh of course morris strong was there as a secretary general
[19:03.880 --> 19:11.640]  convening this congress and grow harlem bruntland i think of her as kind of a
[19:12.360 --> 19:18.200]  concentration camp lady because she's in charge of of reducing the population of the world that's
[19:18.200 --> 19:24.440]  what her job is she was the head of world health organization for about six years and
[19:25.720 --> 19:33.560]  she is also a member of a new club with jenny carter and tutu and and some other people
[19:33.560 --> 19:40.440]  it's called the elders and the elders have hunt direct contact with the club of rome
[19:41.080 --> 19:46.360]  hot stay there we got a break let's continue along that line and then other meetings you went to
[19:46.920 --> 19:52.680]  this amazing stuff ladies and gentlemen uh i mean there's you know videos out there of our
[19:52.680 --> 19:57.720]  guests introducing morris strong and the rest of them right in the middle of all of this this is an

[27:00.680 --> 27:07.640]  i want to continue here okay uh so how did the conference end and then what other conferences
[27:07.640 --> 27:18.120]  did you attend the okay the congress the congress ended by ross child presenting his banking program
[27:18.120 --> 27:25.880]  to the congress to grow our umbrella to present to the united nations in october of 1987
[27:29.080 --> 27:35.960]  that was the end of it now since then uh you know everyone's complaining about morris strong
[27:35.960 --> 27:42.760]  take uh allegedly taking a one billion or one million dollar bribe from the un and the oil
[27:42.760 --> 27:53.320]  for food program and and fox just uh just uh uh uh for found him up by by exposing him to the new
[27:53.320 --> 28:00.280]  world uh to that uh uh to the copenhagen congress you made billions there and i'll announce it to
[28:00.280 --> 28:08.840]  you right now he got eight million dollars when he sold the vodka for water lot rights which he
[28:08.840 --> 28:16.280]  did not own in other words it seems to me that there was fraud committed either at the nature
[28:16.280 --> 28:24.760]  conservancy uh level or uh covesa at the vodka land company level but someone can easily find
[28:24.760 --> 28:31.960]  that eight million dollars that he got and uh i i hear by blow the whistle on well here's that
[28:31.960 --> 28:38.360]  fox news report on global warming follow the money and it talks about morris strong and and

[28:43.640 --> 28:48.360]  took more than 15 000 acres from people and didn't pay him one tenth of what it was worth
[28:48.360 --> 28:53.080]  then they turned around a few years later and took their restrictions off and built on it themselves
[28:53.080 --> 28:58.760]  see that's the kind of stuff they do they maneuver themselves through these institutions and
[28:59.320 --> 29:07.000]  uh and uh acronymical uh corporations like abc corporation and you can't follow the trail
[29:08.200 --> 29:15.960]  morris strong uh tried to bury his trail when he left uh the united states in a hurry because i
[29:15.960 --> 29:23.320]  reported him to the congress for for tacking a rider on to the quadrennial water bill that was
[29:23.320 --> 29:30.360]  allowed growth and development to the uc aquifers uh and he and that that issue which would have
[29:30.360 --> 29:36.520]  passed if i hadn't written to the congressman until two a.m. in the morning if i hadn't written
[29:36.520 --> 29:44.280]  to him they would have passed it and uh awdi morris strong's company would have been often

[34:48.920 --> 34:54.920]  religion the un said in 96 and their biological diversity assessment and i even have a clip of
[34:54.920 --> 35:00.280]  them at the un saying we must worship our mother goddess and now they're teaching the children
[35:00.280 --> 35:04.440]  these chants and public schools and private schools that are accredited and they now admit it's
[35:04.440 --> 35:09.880]  going to be a global religion in fact where are those magazines i had in here i guess i've already
[35:09.880 --> 35:13.880]  cleaned it up will you ask erin because he took them out no no no here they are here they are
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.840]  look at this there's so many of these i just thought to show you this here is outside magazine
[35:21.800 --> 35:27.880]  likening the new heir of the roth child family the son of the person that that uh
[35:27.880 --> 35:35.880]  george hunt was exposing here he is the hero gene how to tap into yours and then you open it up and
[35:35.880 --> 35:44.840]  it talks about him being like jesus you open it up and it talks about him being a christ figure
[35:45.960 --> 35:52.440]  i mean this is just so incredibly sickening they're calling jesus here give me a close shot of this
[35:52.440 --> 36:02.680]  plastics jesus the savior how to be a hero uh and again here they are on the cover of the magazine
[36:02.680 --> 36:07.960]  the hero gene how to tap into yours this is your role model the guy that got on my show
[36:07.960 --> 36:13.080]  he's openly called for global government by the way at copenhagen on bloomberg tv a guy got on my
[36:13.080 --> 36:18.120]  show and i said well mars's ice caps have been getting smaller too from solar system warming
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.000]  from the sun and he said well that's because mars is closer to the sun than earth and i said no it's
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.720]  not it's the next planet out then it's the gas giants he said no it's not and laughed at me he
[36:27.720 --> 36:32.120]  was laughing at the audience he thinks you're like the general public here's another one the thinking
[36:32.120 --> 36:40.120]  man's thinking man the eco profit gets real al gore see he's a prophet it's all a religion but
[36:40.120 --> 36:43.640]  that's coming up and he's going to be with us at least 20 minutes to the next hour because there's
[36:43.640 --> 36:49.080]  so many facets to cover george hot before we get into the religious angle and the scams they're running
[36:49.720 --> 36:53.960]  i want to play some audio clips and get into some of the other questions you sent me that you think
[36:53.960 --> 36:59.800]  are important to get into but get working with them being around and then finding out who they were
[36:59.800 --> 37:06.520]  tracking them what is their bottom line i mean i don't know if you've seen my film in game but
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.400]  from the un documents from their statements it's a planetary dictatorship
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.240]  to then carry out the orderly extermination of at least 80 of the world population
[37:17.240 --> 37:25.000]  you know you caught me uh at a standstill i'm not familiar with with that well i need to
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.680]  send you a copy of my film in game but specifically there there are plans for population reduction
[37:30.680 --> 37:41.000]  did you ever run into that well um i have yes i have but uh it's rather grim i believe that
[37:41.000 --> 37:51.640]  world health organization has uh has uh included a eight virus into their inoculations that they're
[37:51.640 --> 37:57.000]  doing for the good of mankind of course uh and that's why we're seeing the population
[37:57.560 --> 38:03.720]  dying of AIDS in africa uh well they've been caught yes that's on record a sister country of
[38:03.720 --> 38:11.320]  rwanda said the bank credit leone's uh they since gone out of business but they're the ones that
[38:11.320 --> 38:18.520]  financed the rwandan massacre they sent it to the president of rwanda who was working with them
[38:18.520 --> 38:23.640]  and uh you know i come across these terrible things that are going on in the planet even
[38:23.640 --> 38:30.520]  while we speak it's terrible well we know the un was involved in financing the rwandan massacre
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.640]  of christians because they wanted their property for big oil companies and mining companies and
[38:35.640 --> 38:42.040]  financed by banks i'm not particularly familiar with the bank you mentioned but what type of world
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.800]  do they want to build and how are they using environmentalism to sell the public on giving
[38:47.800 --> 38:56.680]  up their rights they are gearing society towards a feudalistic society in my opinion where they'll
[38:56.680 --> 39:05.240]  have lords of the manners uh the duchess of uh boulder and the and the queen of las vegas uh
[39:05.240 --> 39:11.000]  you know they'll they'll adapt they'll adopt titles and stuff they'll go into a a feudalistic
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.520]  society similar to what we had in the middle ages and uh they will also introduce the worship of
[39:18.520 --> 39:26.600]  mother earth as part of the religion uh so that we will somehow tie in the religion with acceptance
[39:26.600 --> 39:34.120]  of the world order uh that's all i can say vaguely about where they're headed now i've
[39:34.120 --> 39:39.720]  got these audio clips and then i want to get into some of their religious beliefs and and i mean
[39:39.720 --> 39:45.160]  having psychics vet you to be able to go to the conference uh the secret conference i mean just
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.760]  the bizarreness and that sounds crazy to people that don't research them but openly you in documents
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.280]  talk about the occult and how much they believe in it uh what would you how would you sum up their
[39:56.280 --> 40:01.080]  earth religion i mean because that's a broad title earth religion we see the new movie avatar
[40:01.080 --> 40:07.400]  is all about a earth religion uh but but i mean i mean how would you sum up their their earth religion
[40:07.400 --> 40:17.800]  honey strong moorey strong's wife is the head of the earth religion cult uh she crest on colorado
[40:17.800 --> 40:23.720]  has been chosen as the center because that is where the eastern religions meet the western
[40:23.720 --> 40:32.440]  religions they say that's the point there where god is going to uh going to have a sexual intercourse
[40:32.440 --> 40:39.560]  with mother earth to bring forth the christ that's what they believe
[40:42.360 --> 40:42.680]  hello
[40:45.560 --> 40:49.000]  did i knock you off your seat no no it's i mean i'm listening
[40:51.720 --> 40:56.920]  okay no no i mean i've been to bohemian grove i infiltrated it and they addressed the owl as
[40:56.920 --> 41:03.160]  an owl then as a bull as molik they addressed it as male and female the owl is the female uh
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.760]  and the cults are all a little bit different and then the bull is the male and they talk about
[41:08.760 --> 41:16.120]  how they sacrifice children and goodly tire that's a quote to uh the uh molik the bull but then they
[41:16.120 --> 41:22.920]  also address it as a female and so they always see it as the horn god the male and then the female
[41:22.920 --> 41:29.800]  and they address it as that and and they believe in this illuminati balance uh and that yes they
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.960]  kill but they also bring life and it's really just a rationale for all the things they do
[41:35.160 --> 41:42.440]  yeah you've got the core right there alex uh but it's starting in moorey strong country
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.240]  and we've learned already we can't trust him so you know that this religion and they will get it
[41:49.240 --> 41:56.760]  through you know the big brother religion uh they will uh process the minds of our children
[41:57.560 --> 42:03.960]  in the school such as they have al gore rushing into the first grade and telling them how how the
[42:03.960 --> 42:10.520]  chicken licking stories about the earth is is going to fall apart well he's also an audio
[42:10.520 --> 42:17.080]  at huge elementary school conferences and the auditorium saying tell your parents what to do
[42:17.080 --> 42:22.040]  do they don't know you're the boss in the new york times reports they've got kids all over the
[42:22.040 --> 42:27.160]  country writing mock tickets to their parents for taking a hot bath that's what they're going to do
[42:27.160 --> 42:33.800]  they're going to train them to blow the whistle on their parents same thing that you read i i urge
[42:33.800 --> 42:42.360]  your listeners to reread 1984 there are a lot of parallels there and then including the earth
[42:42.360 --> 42:51.400]  religion they uh in 1984 they worship big brother but uh in this case it'll be big sister well we
[42:51.400 --> 42:58.840]  have another article at jonesreport.com that's a scan from this outside magazine article and it's
[42:58.840 --> 43:05.000]  got a photo of david the Rothschild wearing a skull and bones belt it says he's jesus but
[43:05.000 --> 43:12.360]  he's also wearing a skull and crossbones belt what do you think of that well as christian i i would
[43:12.360 --> 43:18.760]  immediately be repulsed by it i don't know what he was uh uh saying to the public i don't know if
[43:18.760 --> 43:27.400]  he was mocking jesus christ like uh some of uh some of the orthodox jews do but uh the the uh
[43:27.400 --> 43:35.800]  um uh the gist is that uh they're out to capture the minds of people this is a mind game that we're
[43:35.800 --> 43:42.920]  involved in info wars yeah they use guilt over the environment to sell people into giving up their
[43:42.920 --> 43:49.720]  rights to them giving up their rights to the state but in this case to die of mother earth
[43:49.720 --> 43:57.640]  and they'll be rewarded for it they'll get a razor blade uh uh ration it's special because
[43:57.640 --> 44:04.120]  they worship mother earth but if you don't worship mother earth you're toast by the way
[44:04.120 --> 44:10.200]  by the way or sell because the bank won't give you those privileges it all works together
[44:10.760 --> 44:18.600]  by the way i'm for a very uh uh humongous society controlling us well going back to what you just
[44:18.600 --> 44:24.760]  said the bbc this weekend had a headline that i showed people yesterday where they said rationing
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.520]  is needed a credit ration on your card like you said 20 years ago that they said now they're openly
[44:30.520 --> 44:36.840]  proposing you'll have a card and it has your rations on it for everyone for the earth every can of
[44:36.840 --> 44:43.000]  corn or beans will have a tax on it as well but even if you have the money to buy it you won't get it
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.120]  when your carbon credits run out i mean this is neo feudalism this is serfdom that's right
[44:48.120 --> 44:56.200]  they're going to tax each each can of beans or corn or or whatever you have they're going to
[44:56.200 --> 45:03.320]  determine how much of mother earth went into the growth of this product and they're going to add that
[45:03.320 --> 45:10.760]  to the cost of the product as if life hurts life the whole process of life and death and
[45:10.760 --> 45:17.080]  regeneration of food is what the life cycle is by taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe
[45:17.080 --> 45:23.640]  that all animals exhale they can corner the entire life cycle yes that's what they say
[45:24.920 --> 45:31.960]  in fact ross child said that he wanted to capture all of the carbon dioxide turn it into dry ice and
[45:31.960 --> 45:39.160]  shift the dry ice to the polar caps to keep them from melting and of course he's going to take care
[45:39.160 --> 45:44.440]  of that of course he would make the money off of doing that excuse me go ahead and of course he
[45:44.440 --> 45:48.840]  would make the money off of that like bill gates patenting all this stuff to stop carbon dioxide
[45:48.840 --> 45:56.280]  oh yeah take a lot of dry dry ice to keep the polar caps from melting what about uh what about
[45:57.000 --> 46:02.200]  billa melinda gates and their eugenics foundation do you ever run into that no i have the gates
[46:02.200 --> 46:09.320]  foundation yes i have run it i think it's a it's a pacific it's a passive organization that bill
[46:09.320 --> 46:15.640]  gates has he doesn't seem like he's a he's a killer or anything like that well we we've done
[46:15.640 --> 46:20.120]  research on it it's carefully guarded and we've had some internal whistleblowers i mean you know
[46:20.120 --> 46:25.400]  his dad was the former head of plant parenthood and uh he used for population reduction and uh
[46:25.400 --> 46:33.640]  you know he's busy inoculating the little children oh didn't know that well there's a lot okay you've
[46:33.640 --> 46:38.040]  taught us and there's a lot you know that we all can teach each other here uh there's so much more
[46:38.040 --> 46:42.600]  to get into and your ideas of how to stop these people and and more of what you learned about
[46:42.600 --> 46:46.040]  their agenda but i want to play some of these audio clips before i do that before we get into the
[46:46.040 --> 46:52.920]  occult aspects some more anything else you want to add george hunt uh and not to the um uh spiritual
[46:52.920 --> 46:59.480]  part but just keep on going and maybe i can add some things to your talk okay you sent me 19 clips
[46:59.480 --> 47:04.920]  we can play any of these clips you want but i'm going to go ahead and play uh morey strong
[47:04.920 --> 47:09.800]  banking principles because it all sounds slick and sweet and loving but you can break down what he
[47:09.800 --> 47:14.360]  really means by that and now 27 years later we can see it's all been proven you were correct
[47:14.360 --> 47:18.680]  and what you got from this but here's morey strong that you recorded at one of the meetings here it is
[47:19.640 --> 47:27.480]  now all i'm saying really is that there are many areas in which it is possible
[47:27.480 --> 47:36.520]  uh to uh apply banking principles michael sweetman is a bank he's run major banking organizations
[47:36.520 --> 47:42.040]  and when he has proposed this idea he'll have to talk for himself but my understanding of it
[47:42.040 --> 47:50.040]  was that it was meant to tap new sources of funding to channel in to these areas in which
[47:50.040 --> 47:57.480]  uh an important conservation objective can be achieved in a manner compatible with a fair
[47:57.480 --> 48:06.120]  an economic return a bankable economic return okay now we see that today later in clips they
[48:06.120 --> 48:11.800]  talk about every corporation and company having to give money to this bank that will then save
[48:11.800 --> 48:20.360]  the environment uh comments on that george on would you repeat that question alex can we turn
[48:20.360 --> 48:27.960]  our audio up to you i was saying uh in these clips uh they're talking about banking principles
[48:27.960 --> 48:37.560]  and then comments on that uh i think if i if i played the first clip for you it would make it
[48:37.560 --> 48:42.920]  clearer to you to your audience okay let's play clip number one michael sweetman introduces the
[48:42.920 --> 48:48.760]  bank yeah there might be more in there for you okay okay now here's that clip i wonder people
[48:48.760 --> 48:55.880]  probably still coming in but i think we need to get on with the agenda i'm going to uh
[48:56.840 --> 49:02.600]  ask uh more strong to open the session with some remarks and then get asked him to introduce
[49:02.600 --> 49:11.320]  mr droth child on my left and uh following some remarks mr droth child um briefly set the scene
[49:11.320 --> 49:15.960]  and then i'm going to be going to open it to the floor and see if we can get some dialogue and get
[49:15.960 --> 49:21.160]  some response some questions and some ideas from you and we'll take it from there we want we've got
[49:21.160 --> 49:28.040]  three days we've got best topics we're dealing with as as the program uh indicates we've got some
[49:28.040 --> 49:33.160]  very good people on these panels and they've come a long way some of them to be here and i really
[49:33.160 --> 49:39.800]  appreciate that because um they're clearly show indicating interest and i think we're going to
[49:39.800 --> 49:46.040]  have some really a very interesting time over the next three days but not just an interesting
[49:46.040 --> 49:50.040]  time i hope we're going to have a very productive time over the next three days and we're going to
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.160]  come out uh by tomorrow night at any rate with the resolution which we have to hand to the
[49:55.160 --> 49:59.960]  resolution's committee if we want a resolution about the world conservation bank in the congress
[49:59.960 --> 50:05.640]  proceedings and i hope i trust that we do so we've got to think about that as well i suggest what we
[50:05.640 --> 50:11.800]  might do is to cover that at the end of these two sessions this afternoon and maybe some like
[50:11.800 --> 50:19.000]  somebody might not stay back and we could discuss how we um proceed with that uh yes george i could
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.880]  hear you we're finishing the clip you sent us we're going to break but kind of long i'm sorry
[50:23.880 --> 50:28.520]  no it's fine that's good it's great uh we're going to introduce the bank did you hear that
[50:28.520 --> 50:35.800]  we have to we have to uh present this tomorrow and so we convene here with you to get your ideas
[50:35.800 --> 50:43.480]  towards this bank it was a con job it was sure i mean the u n always has its plan already set
[50:43.480 --> 50:48.360]  and then they just have a meeting with some of the elitist and then it's already been ratified

[54:27.880 --> 54:33.560]  over the years he is with us today and his website is the big bank dot com where you can get a
[54:33.560 --> 54:40.040]  documentary film he made along these same lines now got a bunch of clips here 19 clips and i want
[54:40.040 --> 54:44.040]  to play roth child sums up the conference i want to play some of the other clips roth child
[54:44.040 --> 54:49.880]  international communism introduced i want to go over these but first off is 17 you want to play 17
[54:49.880 --> 54:56.760]  david lang now tell people who david lang is george hunt yes he's a uh international banker
[54:56.760 --> 55:02.760]  from montreal canada uh is a close friend of michael sweetman the president of the world
[55:02.760 --> 55:08.200]  conservation bank okay let's go ahead about us yeah this is what he had to say about us here it is
[55:08.200 --> 55:13.640]  this looks like david lang from montreal he's always full of he's always full of awkward
[55:13.640 --> 55:19.240]  questions until recently on a balance sheet there were billions of dollars still listed as existing
[55:19.240 --> 55:23.800]  which have now been written off and so those services have a bad habit of disappearing
[55:23.800 --> 55:29.640]  when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet i suggest therefore that this be
[55:29.640 --> 55:35.400]  sold not through a democratic process that would take too long and devour far too much of the funds
[55:35.400 --> 55:41.160]  to educate the cannon fodder unfortunately which populates the earth we have to take
[55:41.160 --> 55:46.200]  almost an elitist program that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future
[55:46.760 --> 55:53.320]  in timeframes and in results which are not easily understood or which can be with intellectual
[55:53.320 --> 56:01.960]  honesty be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition that's amazing statement george hunt
[56:01.960 --> 56:10.440]  hunt yes it's amazing all right it turned my gut and uh that's why i'm talking to you today
[56:10.440 --> 56:16.200]  alex that just defended me so much we're the cannon fodder that are unfortunately on the earth
[56:16.200 --> 56:20.040]  and they're talking about billions of dollars they already had in their banking system and
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.080]  talking about our property as if it was already there's and how they were going to get it
[56:25.080 --> 56:34.680]  but yes sir and they're they're uh eliminating population uh all the time through age through
[56:34.680 --> 56:44.440]  uh uh uh mercenary armies through people like the black guard people that were we just found out
[56:44.440 --> 56:51.400]  that they were tied in with the cia they're going murdering iraqis it's um the american people have
[56:51.400 --> 56:59.160]  to do something about it or um and and we have to change our leadership we have to get cheney uh we
[56:59.160 --> 57:07.640]  have to get cheney up to to the uh to the bar to the justice bar and find out why hella burton
[57:07.640 --> 57:18.120]  hired these black guard people that are killing citizens it's it's all over uh it's all through

[1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:11.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:20.520]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:21.480 --> 1:00:26.680]  coming up at the bottom of the hour when george hunt leaves us i'm going to get into the latest on
[1:00:26.680 --> 1:00:33.400]  health care the flu scam has now been completely exposed by the eu itself as a total fraud and
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:38.920]  they admit these vaccines were dangerous and it was wrong uh we're also going to get into the latest
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.680]  on bankster gate with timmy geithner and all of his criminal activity and your phone calls but
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:50.680]  george hunt inside whistleblower who by a twist of fate wanted to get his son a job in conservation
[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:57.640]  and literally one of the heads of the global government conference was sick he called him
[1:00:57.640 --> 1:01:01.240]  and he said probably didn't thought it was somebody else from the conference calling and said yeah
[1:01:01.240 --> 1:01:06.360]  you can go and just walk right into this and that's why it's important you go to government
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:11.560]  non-governmental events weasel your way in record it you won't be i mean i went to a smart growth
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:17.000]  conference in 1998 in austin they had 4 000 people there mainly from counties and cities
[1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:22.760]  paid by the cities to be there and they had the heads of the banks going we're taking everybody's
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:28.040]  property they weren't denying it it was a joke they were admitting they were criminals i mean
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:34.120]  they didn't even deny it okay and i was just whoa that's when i really woke up to the environmentalist
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:39.080]  i mean i already thought i knew they were just misguided communists no no no these are bankers
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:44.680]  okay so this next clip is roth child elaborates then we'll go through more of these clips and
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:51.240]  get george hunt's take on it okay roth child elaborates will play this to overcome the chilling
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:59.240]  doom laden prognostications of dr erving mincer's greenhouse effect perhaps it could be possible
[1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:08.360]  to utilize co2 carbon dioxide one of its main causes to manufacture dry ice to maintain the
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:15.080]  polar caps and the actual temperature of the ice there and maintain their present temperature
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:24.200]  innovative and modern technology world waste material collected and perhaps burnt in volcanic
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:30.360]  areas or buried so deep in the earth in the wilderness desert areas of the mid sahara where
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:39.240]  nobody goes or in the empty quarter in arabia or the goby desert but all these ideas and visions
[1:02:39.880 --> 1:02:50.840]  some far-fetched and above all the continuation of this congress needs money so they get to
[1:02:50.840 --> 1:02:56.920]  take over and ship dry ice imagine the money they'd make or they will control globally toxic
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:01.240]  waste being shipped to the sahara so they want to control waste management they want to control
[1:03:01.240 --> 1:03:07.800]  private property and they want to scare the public with far-fetched programs into accepting
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:12.120]  that the earth must be dying from carbon dioxide because look at all the money we're spending on
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:18.360]  it it must be real is that an accurate breakdown of what he was really saying there george hunt
[1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:26.040]  yes they're creating a demand for dry ice machines shall we say through their rhetoric
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:33.960]  so that the people will become fearful of mother earth crumbling and they'll give in then to all
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:41.400]  of these monstrous projects that will cost trillions of dollars and and the elite will be
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:50.600]  in the front end of these projects in the maybe as the the first investors and it will grow into a
[1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:58.280]  huge monster and then it'll collapse and the elite will have pulled themselves out of the
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:08.040]  of this project before it collapses so you're going to see a lot of these ideas coming along
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:15.880]  that will change the climate harp is one one example that was another point and we're going
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:20.120]  to go to break long segment coming up and play clip after clip but clearly it's now
[1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:25.480]  declassified they have weather weapons they can create control hurricanes that's all declassified
[1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:30.600]  we know the why how science are john p holder who's called for global extermination drugging
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:37.640]  the water to sterilizes in his own book eco science we know that they're already manipulating the
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:42.600]  weather to create calamities to scare people into submission george hunt stay there i'm going to come
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:47.800]  back and get your take on that on the other side of this quick break and then we're going to play
[1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:54.040]  clip after clip and get quick comments from you about what broth child strong and others are saying
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:05:00.280]  they talk about international communism being introduced this is incredible info this is alex
[1:05:00.280 --> 1:05:05.240]  jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:10.520]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:15.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:21.400]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:26.520]  of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:31.720]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:05:31.720 --> 1:05:36.120]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:41.160]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe
[1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:45.640]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can

[1:07:06.600 --> 1:07:11.720]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:17.880]  americans at home and have a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:24.200]  calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:29.960]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:35.080]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[1:07:35.080 --> 1:07:39.640]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:45.560]  make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen

[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:21.400]  be he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:27.560]  eight minutes into hour number three george hunt was just talking about how they declassified
[1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:33.720]  weather manipulation weather control systems and how they can clearly use this to create
[1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:38.840]  calamities and then scare the population into submission that's been one of my biggest concerns
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:48.600]  going back to george hunt george your take on that well um the um the concern that i have
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:59.320]  is that the e-bomb the uh so-called uh surge bomb the electromagnetic pulse weapon
[1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:06.600]  yes you got it that thing would be easy for any little state like north paria or
[1:09:06.600 --> 1:09:14.600]  iran or israel to send a rocket uh bearing an atomic bomb up in the sky about 300 miles
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:21.560]  exploding it and wiping out all of the electricity in in line of sight of that explosion that's the
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:28.360]  thing to bother you think the globalist would go that far oh yes david rockfeller has uh stated
[1:09:28.360 --> 1:09:35.000]  and i checked it on the on the internet last night that the world order will not be established
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:41.400]  until a terrible catastrophe occurs yeah they all say that continually he actually said that in the
[1:09:41.400 --> 1:09:47.000]  council on farm relations publication foreign affairs that's part of their fear doctrine huh
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:53.480]  maybe do you want to continue along that line or go to some more clips well i'd like to follow the
[1:09:53.480 --> 1:10:01.160]  line let's go to some clips let's have morris strong uh number seven okay morris strong
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:05.880]  announces announces roth child they don't want to get to roth child talking about communism
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:10.920]  okay here's morris strong play that one no no no let's play seven first let's go through these
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:19.240]  here seven there is no better person he epitomizes in his own life that positive synthesis between
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:26.200]  environment conservation on the one hand and economics on the other and i'm just delighted
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:33.640]  to have this opportunity of uh introducing to you edmund the roth child now i want to go ahead
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:40.440]  now and go to clip number uh 13 i want to play the world collective again then some new clips
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:46.840]  14 and others here's 13 with roth child by thinking forward as to how to reach out to the public at
[1:10:46.840 --> 1:10:56.680]  large to every corporate entity throughout the world to put aside hopefully tax-free a part of
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:06.200]  their profits to fund our ecological and environmental protection so tax-free paid to his bank i have
[1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:12.600]  Reuters right here 20 something years later here it is happening giving them money and then they're
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:20.040]  tax-free to use it that's it i didn't know that occurred but i saw the banks tumbling down and
[1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:27.160]  as the banks tumble they're tumbling to the house of roth child now on the last clip you played
[1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:34.600]  or the one before that did you hear morris strong announcing as the positive synthesis
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:43.160]  between conservation on one side and growth and development on the other he is the result of
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:50.360]  he controls in other words the conservation movement and the economic movement ross child's
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:57.480]  gut at all well i've seen all the big roth child's out of england uh the the two heads of it openly
[1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:02.120]  writing articles giving speeches calling for global governance we'll play a clip from bloomberg
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:09.480]  during kopenhagen coming up uh let's go ahead now and go to clip number 14 roth child lord roth child
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:16.280]  international communism introduced here's that clip oh ladies and gentlemen every country has its
[1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:24.360]  own problems its indigenous peoples and its wildlife this international conservation bank
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:35.320]  must know no frontiers no boundaries its funds must be used constructively and not and not to be
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:42.520]  challenged into greedy hands or weapons of destruction so here are these people always
[1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:48.520]  financing revolutions and wars and weapons systems uh and and and you call that communism
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:55.640]  introduced why do you say that yes uh in other words the currency will be used as a as a communal
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:06.040]  device because there will be one world currency and he's saying too i is every call and speech
[1:13:06.040 --> 1:13:15.240]  that that uh each each country uh also has its own indigenous people and they'll they'll be allowed
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:22.040]  to have soft currencies but the currencies will be intermingled and uh and yeah you're going to
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:28.280]  have a global currency over the regionals which they're now setting up it's amazing 23 years later
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:34.280]  to see all of this actually unfolding and uh also ban chi moon a month and a half ago in the new
[1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:41.000]  orc times secretary general the un he said all nations will be forced to pay into the un uh to
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  fund this uh let's play let's play clip number 15 roth child brags here it is
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:56.600]  if there are any japanese in the audience i would apologize to them but i've had
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:14:03.000]  been a great experience in japan since my family has had connections with them since 1865 after
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:15.320]  peri opened them up in 1863 let's play another clip uh let's have michael sweetman james baker
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:21.960]  quote clip number 16 here's michael sweetman james baker quote here it is i just keynote address
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  to this congress u.s treasury secretary james a baker pointed to the i quote the underlying
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:34.840]  reality that sound conservation is good economics and further conservation should not be the enemy
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:44.120]  of prosperity it should instead sustain and enrich our prosperity i'm good how do you decipher that
[1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:54.680]  decode that uh george hunt well i i couldn't hear him very well on that uh i uh i have to uh beg
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:58.760]  like yeah that's i think that's part of the problem today if you're having trouble hearing
[1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:05.400]  that was the james baker quote by uh michael sweetman yes i played i set that up for you
[1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:12.760]  to play because james baker made a remark that caused the conservationist to tremble at the
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:19.240]  beginning of the meeting he gave a keynote address and he said that conservation required
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:25.800]  growth and development and the conservationist said what you could hear the murmur in the audience
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:33.400]  well what that means is that ross child in order to be the positive synthesis of growth and development
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:44.040]  and economics uh has to have a dynamic going it has to be a forceful opposition in order for his
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:51.240]  his group to go in and pick up the pieces that take over control so he's encouraging this war
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:58.680]  between conservation and development and he is the synthesis of all the stuff that will come out of
[1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:05.240]  the war now for those that missed it i want to play banker david lang talking about their elitist
[1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:09.880]  program and how to deal with the cannon fodder one more time and then two final clips we haven't
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:16.120]  played yet play clip 17 it's so chilling here is clip 17 david lang from montreal
[1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:21.800]  he's always full of he's always full of awkward questions until recently on a balance sheet
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:26.280]  there were billions of dollars still listed as existing which have now been written off
[1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:30.520]  and so those surfaces have a bad habit of disappearing when the auditor finally gets his
[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:37.560]  hands into the balance sheet i suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process
[1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:43.080]  that would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder
[1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:49.320]  unfortunately which populates the earth we have to take almost an elitist program that we can see
[1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:56.200]  beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future in timeframes and in results which are not easily
[1:16:56.200 --> 1:17:01.880]  understood or which can be with intellectual honesty be reduced down to some kind of simplistic
[1:17:01.880 --> 1:17:09.720]  definition okay george haunt uh george i want to ask you about this maharajah clip
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:14.120]  where he questions michael sweetman's words uh we're going to play this clip and then get
[1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:21.480]  you to comment on that okay all right good here's the maharajah questions michael sweetman's words
[1:17:21.480 --> 1:17:30.440]  here it is i'd be very brief when listening patiently michael sweetman's paper and the
[1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:41.320]  discussion so far i'm confused particularly since i am the president of the world wildlife fund
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:58.760]  india an NGO of the need of another helping hand but since this baby has been accidentally conceived
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:11.640]  by michael sweetman and i presume that he's either a very foolish man or a very clever man i think
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:20.120]  he's a very clever man because the paper does not give any details it's very general wow so
[1:18:20.120 --> 1:18:28.040]  maharajah is pointing out this gives a blank check of power to this world conference congress
[1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:33.560]  instead of the world wildlife fund set up by the nazi prince Bernhardt to carry out extermination
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:41.160]  what's what's going on in that clip with the maharajah well the maharajah um saw the light
[1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:49.640]  he he saw that either it was a very foolish plan that michael sweetman was introducing
[1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:57.720]  you know save save the world's conservation or it was a clever plan and he didn't identify
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:05.400]  why it was clever but he said but i i believe it's a clever plan uh it's a clever plan because it
[1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:14.600]  it uh seems to appear that they are saving conservation and i think that's what the maharajah
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:23.480]  saw they were going to get money out of it instead of nice pretty new trees it's a clever plan
[1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:29.400]  and everyone laughs because they understand that that of course it's a joke that's why they're there
[1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:34.200]  is to get their hands on property and control the world population so he's stating the obvious

[1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:47.640]  going to come to pass and what i got out of them was there will be a collapse in 2012

[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:37.640]  another big bombshell studying the unzone documents studying the imf world bank the
[1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:42.200]  banks want to get everybody in debt all the nations all the sub states within the nations
[1:24:42.200 --> 1:24:48.040]  bankrupted to then make you dependent on them and then under environmental rules grab and snatch
[1:24:48.040 --> 1:24:55.400]  property and and raise the taxes so you go bankrupt then they bring in a global regime global
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:25:00.760]  rationing openly being announced this is their plan they're brainwashing your kids in school
[1:25:00.760 --> 1:25:05.800]  they're really trying it copenhagen was a big blow against them the fact that the that their
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:11.320]  scientists know it's a fraud ben santa at the un admitting that it's all you know made up that
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:16.920]  they basically cut these sections out of the un report where their own scientists said man wasn't
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:21.720]  causing global warming or they're covering up the fact for the last nine years the earth has been
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:29.800]  radically cooling all of this uh and then he's saying he's there talking to rockefeller talking
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:38.760]  to others specifically tell that story and their world in 2012 this is in 1987 everything george
[1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:44.600]  talked about he put this out 15 years ago or more has now come true really proving what he's saying
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.840]  but uh specifically take your time who said this again was it rockefeller i'm going from memory
[1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:55.480]  at this conference they said how they're going to do it and make the world conservation bank take
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:26:06.600]  over okay it was the you remember i was there for three days asking lots of questions okay so
[1:26:07.240 --> 1:26:16.200]  the the questions evolved to number one question i had was how is this bank going to be funded
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:24.680]  i learned through the the guests there maybe i went to mcneil of the united nations i don't
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:33.640]  know where but i found out that the plan is and this is hearsay that the plan is that the
[1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:46.040]  that the bank is going to bankrupt in 2012 and that the the uh uh the the elite that put money
[1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:53.480]  into the bank when it bankrupts those elite people will go into the bank take it over and take over
[1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:59.960]  every mortgage everything all the accounts all the credit cards everything that people have
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:06.520]  and the bank will then officially be in ross child's hands where before it was
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:12.760]  surreptitiously in ross child's hands well this is incredible let me stop you don't want you to
[1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:19.160]  elaborate george hunt because now we see a small group of central banks bankrupting other banks
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:23.400]  by design to consolidate that's in their own documents we see the imf and world bank
[1:27:23.400 --> 1:27:28.920]  to be holding companies for the global tax money through what they did agree to at covenhagen
[1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:35.640]  and that's actually what they're now setting up they're openly setting up what participants told
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:42.040]  you they were going to set up are they getting this position for 2012 that's where they're headed
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:49.480]  from my last information alex um they don't slow down on their plans they don't defer them
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:56.440]  they just eliminate the problem for their plans to go through people like me of course
[1:27:56.440 --> 1:28:06.920]  um so yeah i i would say there's going to be a major uh currency uh splash in 2012
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:13.320]  because we're leading up to 2000 or leading up to 2012 i mean this is already happening
[1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:18.840]  yeah the globe is imploding by an engineered depression and everything is falling to the
[1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:23.160]  house of ross child and roger veller and every time they bust an oligarch in russia
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:27.720]  it turns out it was really owned by the ross child that's mainstream news well yeah well
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:33.640]  look at the news about warren buffett he he's accusing the ross child family of controlling
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:40.440]  the world gold market he's probably right because the ross child set the price of gold twice a day
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:49.320]  in london for the world unbelievable information and again when did you first start going public
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:54.360]  releasing the videos of the conferences releasing the audio and saying all of this wasn't it
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:29:03.000]  like 20 years ago yes it was the 1988 that uh i uh preacher named charl oh allendale
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:13.960]  who had a radio station in in texas was uh was accused of uh of having a uh having me on
[1:29:13.960 --> 1:29:20.680]  and they said look if you have that guy george hunt on again you're going to lose your job well
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:26.440]  he had me on again the next week because this is earth shattery news well the station was immediately
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:33.000]  bought out and allen allen dale lost his job and that's the that's the issue 20 years ago
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:38.920]  22 years ago they could they could stop stuff now they can't it's out in the open stay there george

[1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:15.480]  it was the corporate leaders there running the government meetings with the bureaucracy saying

[1:35:55.880 --> 1:36:03.240]  manipulating the weather that's right they've already they they dreamed up these plans uh as far as
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:09.640]  hundreds of years ago and that the uh the contemporary plans that we see where the banks
[1:36:09.640 --> 1:36:17.880]  are going down and so on is that uh is part of their plan that was conceived um as far as i could
[1:36:17.880 --> 1:36:23.000]  see a hundred years ago okay i want to go to calls but first i want to play a few global
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:27.800]  governance clips for people that may have missed the last few of them uh that have occurred in
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:32.680]  the last two months herman von rumpi the head of the eu openly calling for global governance
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:39.480]  saying that the un global carbon tax is the heart of world government uh the head of the eu we have
[1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:45.080]  gordon brown calling for global governance we have uh david iraq child the heir to this whole
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:52.200]  criminal fortune uh calling for it here is david iraq child from kopenhagen on bloomberg tv it's
[1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:58.120]  past the point of talking um we know historically that the global governance um that sort of agenda
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.360]  to these issues is is very hard to try and is with all the best intentions it's very hard to
[1:37:02.360 --> 1:37:07.400]  actually activate we're seeing that right now we're seeing a lot of fragmentation going on in kopenhagen
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:11.640]  a lot of different agendas pulling in different directions and i think what we're what we really
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:16.040]  need to see is people on the ground starting to actually act upon the low hanging fruit and start
[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:22.760]  to try and move on the solutions that we have at hand in case you missed it global it's past
[1:37:22.760 --> 1:37:28.600]  the point of talking um we know historically that the global governance um that sort of agenda
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:34.280]  to these issues is is very hard to try and is is with all the best so there he is saying the time
[1:37:34.280 --> 1:37:39.560]  for talk is over that means you don't get any input we're doing this well we did get input
[1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:47.000]  we did expose their fraud they're in trouble george hunt for this whole global uh a carbon
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:53.880]  tax uh thing that's going on i have to admit that i don't really understand it but i do know
[1:37:53.880 --> 1:38:00.440]  that the house of ross child pushed it through there uh through the chairman of the house of
[1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:09.000]  ross child uh at a meeting of the london banks that was that happened about uh six months ago
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:17.560]  when i picked up on that clip they this carbon tax uh what do you know about it alex well it's
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:23.720]  fully meant to tax and control all human activity to be selectively enforced uh just like the health
[1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:30.280]  care plan some unions don't have to do it but the rest of the public do it's all selectively
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:35.960]  enforced like obama decided what car dealership stayed open what didn't three billion dollars
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:42.840]  the 25 billion for the auto bailout paid to move factories on record this is associated press
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:49.640]  to brazil eastern europe russia and china so the globalist literally pay to have factories
[1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:56.440]  built for themselves as morris strong said on tv in 1992 and rio de Janeiro is the head of the
[1:38:56.440 --> 1:39:03.800]  un summit it is our job to it to destroy industrial society in the west uh let's play this clip of
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:09.640]  herman von ruby uh in his acceptance speech is the new head of the eu calling for global governance
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:16.520]  2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the g20 in the middle
[1:39:16.520 --> 1:39:23.960]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in copenhagen is another step towards the global
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:36.680]  management of our planet our mission our presidency is one of hope supported by acts and by deeds okay
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:43.080]  again there's herman von ruby we have bancai moon gordon brown why are they coming out in the open
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:49.560]  now because we're approaching uh the 2011 12 which all the economists here say they believe
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:54.040]  is the time that everything's going to collapse are they are they getting us ready for global government
[1:39:54.760 --> 1:39:59.960]  oh oh yes they're getting us ready for global government even in the schools intermediate
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:09.960]  schools colleges uh people are all whistling uh global government uh it's it it has infected
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:19.160]  our society already uh they'll uh they'll attract the people through the religious aspects of the
[1:40:19.160 --> 1:40:26.280]  government through the promise of uh of being able to buy or sell if you cooperated with the
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:32.520]  global global government if you don't cooperate you won't be able to buy or sell that that's
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:38.040]  been prophesied in the bible and i think that we're headed for that very soon when we have
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:45.240]  only one bank and they're openly saying that's their program this global private banking government
[1:40:45.240 --> 1:40:49.320]  will decide if you can have a business if you can have a factory if you can have a job if you
[1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:55.880]  can have your farm you own i mean this is really happening with the animal id the premise society
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:41:02.680]  all of it that's why it's so yes sir in the copenhagen 50 of the echo 15 whatever it was called
[1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:12.120]  it the copenhagen uh if if we had if if we had gone to the line and signed that document we would
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:19.000]  have been giving away our rights to how much hot water we can use per day what kind of car will
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:27.560]  drive we would have made ourselves in the as the same common person in the world and here we are
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:33.640]  a blessed country and we give it all up through copenhagen 15 it's not enough for these bankers
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:38.760]  to rob and loot and run their scams they want to shut off our resources to make us completely
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:43.800]  dependent on them we're going to calls now i want to encourage everybody to go to the big bank
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:50.200]  dot com the big bad bank dot com we have links to it up on info wars dot com the big bad bank
[1:41:50.200 --> 1:41:56.520]  dot com and to get your video and book both titled the big bad bank uh also while you're
[1:41:56.520 --> 1:42:01.640]  at it folks get full of republic it details who the bankers are how they're imploding the economy
[1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:05.800]  by design their own statements their own documents how they're using the environmental movement
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:10.680]  the police state they're setting up to enforce it in game blueprint for global enslavement covers
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:16.360]  the depopulation their entire program everyone must see this this is real they're doing it
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:22.120]  you ask what is the solution education show the people that environmentalism has nothing to do
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:27.400]  with the environment they co-opt all these good people to serve them this is their takeover and
[1:42:27.400 --> 1:42:32.440]  it's in trouble but they've invested hundreds of billions conservatively in this propaganda
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:37.720]  they're moving forward with it but they're beginning to slow if you take action and educate
[1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:44.040]  everyone you know we can stop these people so get the films at info wars dot com or watch them
[1:42:44.040 --> 1:42:49.800]  in high quality at prison planet dot tv let's go to calls let's talk to mike in pennsylvania
[1:42:49.800 --> 1:42:56.520]  you're on the air with george hunt yeah a question for the guests um it when you had
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.320]  met with the elites had they had mentioned anything about um this was in the late eighties
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:05.160]  from my understanding from what you're saying anything about government sponsored terror in
[1:43:05.160 --> 1:43:12.840]  particular 9 11 being carried out in the future staging crises staging terror attacks no there
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:22.600]  was nothing mentioned of a of a war or warfare or anti-terrorist nothing like that came up
[1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:29.000]  they talked about using the threat of environmental catastrophe which is another form of false
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:38.120]  words it was it was yeah i i missed that you know they he ross charles said that we were uh doomed to
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:45.560]  to extinction if we didn't accept its bank in this program he will save us and now his son we're
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:51.640]  told in the newspaper is a jesus archetype literally i mean you can't you can't make this type of
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:57.480]  bizarreness up ladies and gentlemen uh the hero gene inside talks about him being a jesus figure
[1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:04.120]  anything else mike um dalis you think then then that the kind of right wing arm of the new world
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:09.800]  order like this might be the left wing arm it yes you know it carries that carries out uh you
[1:44:09.800 --> 1:44:14.600]  know the government sponsored terror that that's maybe yes yes i mean both parties both groups
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:21.080]  do it but but but yes the club of rome said in 91 that they will use on the left phony
[1:44:21.080 --> 1:44:27.400]  environmentalism on the right stage terror we have those quotes they published them we have them in
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:32.600]  articles that paul watson's written with direct links they said they will use that pincer to capture
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:37.800]  us on the right they'll use security and terror on the left the environment i appreciate your call
[1:44:37.800 --> 1:44:49.800]  mike comments on that george hunt oh um yes uh the club of rome is is the uh uh the group that
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:58.760]  was brought brought up indirectly at the congress because uh grow harlem bruteland the uh uh the
[1:44:58.760 --> 1:45:07.640]  lady that that accepted ross charles banking program she was there and she's the one that heads up the
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:16.680]  uh the uh the elimination of uh of people on the planet grow harlem bruteland she's she's also the
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:25.560]  chairman i think of the united nations unset uh unit committee uned it's called the bruteland
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:34.680]  committee all right uned is the one that created un cd unset isn't that a funny name unset that's
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:40.920]  united nations commission on environment and development and that's the one that ross child
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:49.320]  was the uh or not that morris strong was the secretary general all right let's take another
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:55.560]  call herman in new york thanks for holding her on the air uh yes oh alec can you hear me yes sir
[1:45:56.760 --> 1:46:00.760]  yeah but i think i have a comment first thing i have a comment and i have a question and i'll
[1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:06.440]  take my answer off there first comment is uh i repost all your articles on my facebook page
[1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:14.680]  facebook dot com slash one zero zero uh b i l l i o n and uh my question for uh mr hunt is what's
[1:46:14.680 --> 1:46:19.880]  the most important part of the eugenics movement that should be highlighted and exposed because when
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:25.480]  i just say eugenics and i just uh speak of the issue it's uh a bit much for the average person
[1:46:25.480 --> 1:46:30.760]  to call they better learn herman's herman's asking again what is the most important part of their
[1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:42.760]  d the depopulation agenda well the most important part is to eliminate uh the people who are destroying
[1:46:42.760 --> 1:46:51.960]  the environment uh if you look at pictures from the broomland report uh that's still available i
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:59.320]  believe from the united nations if you look at the pictures it shows pictures of indigent people
[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:06.600]  who it's better to die than to live yeah they say oh their life isn't happy oh isn't
[1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:13.000]  suicide good is it euthanasia we see newsweek the case for killing granny all these articles
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:18.440]  we're being sold that death is actually compassionate oh don't help people just kill them
[1:47:18.440 --> 1:47:23.320]  that's right thank you thank you herman i appreciate the call terrian ohio terrier on the air
[1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:30.920]  yes alex yes hey i got a question i'm the pastor but here's my thing you've been doing this and
[1:47:30.920 --> 1:47:37.000]  he's talking about too as far as this banking their bankers well you've even asked and you've
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:40.920]  asked for solutions and things like that and people are looking for solutions and i think
[1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:48.520]  i've come up with one and and here it is if everybody quit paying on their credit cards
[1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:53.080]  because the bankers these bankers are going to bank up the banks anyway they're going to take
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:58.680]  their money out of the banks and and i know this is going to have an effect because three hundred
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:04.040]  and sixteen thousand people have left california and look at the effect it's having on that if
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:10.600]  people in every state just opting just quit paying on their credit cards or just up and stop it
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:17.880]  and not paying nothing then they would start losing their money and then we can start taking
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:24.200]  congress say this i mean i'll say this is a very complex issue but but but yes the banks would
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:29.160]  then just get a bailout to themselves of our tax money to pay it but by people not and i'm not
[1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:34.600]  saying do this it's your decision by not supporting the system before they're ready to crash it that
[1:48:34.600 --> 1:48:39.160]  will screw them up and that's why they want global government they talk about tax avoidance
[1:48:39.160 --> 1:48:44.840]  they say they want an eighty seven percent total tax rate worldwide so people don't run from their
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:49.960]  control and that's why they hate it people are leaving massachusetts new york california
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:54.600]  to states where they can still have a little bit lower taxes and survive that's why the globalists
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:59.960]  come in and finance higher taxes locally so you have nowhere to run and this is a very key point
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:04.280]  you brought up that we need to debate more and discuss more let me get a comment from george
[1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:10.840]  hunt on what you just discussed well you know i never thought of those ways that we could
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:18.200]  prevent these people from doing their dirty deeds i think the credit card ideas are good one
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:25.080]  but uh could you get all the people and in the united states to do it together because if you're
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:32.040]  the only one that does that you're going to lose well also again they're putting their cashless
[1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:37.480]  thumbprint face scan buying and selling in so that if you're not in good graces with homeland
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:41.560]  security and the global securities network they've set up an inner pole you won't be allowed to buy
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:45.880]  and sell even if you have the cash that's what the cashless society is you'll still have cash
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:50.040]  you've just got a id to do it and they've openly announced they want that i mean they are coming
[1:49:50.040 --> 1:49:55.960]  in to squeeze you they want to bankrupt you they want to control you i think for for people who
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:50:02.760]  can get into communities or loosely knit organizations rurally that decide to defend each other decide
[1:50:02.760 --> 1:50:06.760]  to get each other out of debt and then you've just got to wait for the tanks to come down the street
[1:50:06.760 --> 1:50:10.920]  whenever that happens and still be politically involved to try to stop that from happening you've
[1:50:10.920 --> 1:50:17.240]  got to prepare for the worst but also fight to stop it again everything's multifaceted
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:21.880]  but uh you see you can't just hide out in the country and wait for them to come but you've
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:26.200]  also got to have communities get to know your neighbors understand who the enemy is and say
[1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:31.160]  we're going to stick together everything the globalists do is about dividing us so we can't
[1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:37.320]  stick together so they can individually come like wolves and rip our guts out that's what they do
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:43.960]  overseas too they get the chiites against the loose sites against the jebusites and they get these
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:48.760]  because they they rile the countries up by getting the religions fighting against this has been the
[1:50:48.760 --> 1:50:53.080]  most amazing interview ever we're going to hold you for one more segment we're going to talk to

[2:10:27.640 --> 2:10:33.000]  conspiracy theorist those of us that question the official story are called that uh tyrell tell us
[2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:38.600]  about the episode coming up tonight today we got 2012 and we kind of you know started with all the
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:43.080]  rumblings of you know the whole elastic calendar and all that but then as we kind of were you know
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:48.040]  we're kind of first like uh sounds a little focused focused but then we started kind of like looking
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:55.080]  in you know to the to the idea that okay what if you know some major catastrophe is on the horizon
[2:10:55.080 --> 2:11:00.600]  and the powerful elite know about it and you know will they let you know would your government let
[2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:05.320]  the people know about it ahead of time or would they just set out to protect themselves and then
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:10.200]  soon they kind of it's ventured into that realm and it's a great episode you know it's a great way
[2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:15.240]  to finish the season and it's uh it's it's pretty pretty frightening for the things we find out you
[2:11:15.240 --> 2:11:19.960]  gotta watch it tonight and then see that the things that we've uncovered and and uh the places that
[2:11:19.960 --> 2:11:25.560]  we send jesse in this episode it's a fun one talking to you and your father and some of the other
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:30.920]  researchers early on you guys thought that a lot of what we're hearing about 2012 is baloney and
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:36.440]  clearly there's a lot of hype uh a thousand different you know views and ideas about what's
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:41.720]  coming up with 2012 but then after you guys did your investigation i don't want to give away too
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:47.880]  much for tonight you got convinced that well the government and rich people clearly think something
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:53.160]  is going on and they are getting ready exactly exactly and i've talked to numerous friends of
[2:11:53.160 --> 2:11:56.680]  mine and like big oil and things like that you know like the acquaintances they have out here
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:00.920]  living in los angeles you kind of around a lot of power and money especially in the film industry
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:04.360]  if you ask that you talk to some of those guys and they'll tell you about like oh yeah you know
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:08.920]  i'm right family has a compound built here and and that kind of thing you're kind of like
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:12.920]  but for what purpose and it's able to keep us protected but then you know they'll never follow
[2:12:12.920 --> 2:12:19.400]  through the chain of thought of why what do you know that i don't know and that's what this episode
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:24.360]  is kind of a problem i mean it's not specifically that the world's gonna end in 2012 but if a
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:29.000]  catastrophic event were to face the world you know who's gonna who's who's gonna get protected
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:33.080]  not you or me you know they're not gonna i don't think they'd care about protecting us i think
[2:12:33.080 --> 2:12:37.800]  they'd care more about you know protecting their own power and influence and making sure that their
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:45.720]  families lived on in a catastrophic event well exactly in switzerland they have well appointed
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:52.680]  facilities with food and water underground for their entire population for at least two years
[2:12:52.680 --> 2:12:59.720]  russia has it for their entire population for at least a year other nations have this but growing
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:06.440]  up in dallas they designate the underground car garages as nuclear fallout shelters but our
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:11.720]  government has spent more than all these other governments combined on its own secret bases
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:17.000]  and underground facilities and the public isn't even allowed to know about it the public is told
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:22.360]  if we get attacked or an asteroid hits or a bio weapon gets released or a chemical weapon gets
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:27.400]  released sorry you're out of luck you're dead and that of course giving people an idea is what this
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:33.240]  episode gets into i mean this is such an important subject and that's what's so amazing you guys set
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:39.960]  out to investigate you know these modern issues that the media calls conspiracy theories and on
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:46.280]  issue after issue you actually find out the real truth and come to the same perspective that i've
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:52.120]  got from deep research and that is what is so amazing because uh you know i don't want to overstate
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:58.280]  my role i was just one consultant of many uh you guys had always found the truth by the time you
[2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:03.880]  checked with me and said what is your view on this our view is this and i was always amazed
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:12.920]  by the fact that you guys came to really uh in depth well calculated uh spectrum analysis of
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:18.360]  what's going on you know well that's just it's just being able to kind of you know look at the
[2:14:18.360 --> 2:14:23.000]  news as a whole and then when you do the research and then you know a lot of respect to right even
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:27.160]  holly or other two uh associate producers you know they were fantastic you can kind of see them on
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:31.640]  the show at the table and then you know all the investigative team you know once you start reading
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:36.200]  the news but reading through the news and then looking at the you know sequence of events and
[2:14:36.200 --> 2:14:40.200]  stories and things like that and then going out and finding the right people to talk to and the
[2:14:40.200 --> 2:14:45.960]  people that are voicing a dissenting opinion of that in the popular opinion uh you you can start
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:50.440]  finding a lot of facts and it doesn't take that much i mean any person at home can can you know
[2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:55.000]  with a few mouse clicks can start learning the truth and you know they start telling their friends
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.760]  then you get a nice steamroll effect and then that's when you can get the system crack
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:03.720]  and hopefully you know bring it back to what it should be and not a not a you know ruling class
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:15.880]  versus poor class well i agree with you i agree with you and it's just very it was great working
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:20.120]  on the show i mean i there was things i didn't know about and i try to pride myself with keeping
[2:15:20.120 --> 2:15:25.080]  ahead of what you know the you know appearing through the news and knowing what the truth is
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.680]  and there are things that we discovered that i didn't even know about you know from from the
[2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:33.960]  mentoring candidates and how deep that went that sounds like focus focus but completely real
[2:15:34.600 --> 2:15:39.960]  um you know to to the to the 2012 stuff you know it was fascinating to work on the show
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:49.400]  so what is your favorite episode of the seven tyrell um my favorite episode probably the seven
[2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:54.760]  would be probably nine eleven just because that was the kind of one that me and my dad you know
[2:15:54.760 --> 2:15:58.680]  that i was able to bring to my dad and kind of open his eyes his eyes up to so i've always kind of
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:04.680]  had to take to say this but warm place you know for uncovering the facts of that of what really
[2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:10.760]  happened that day um you know i just feel obviously we're not we weren't told what what what happened
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:16.280]  that day and then a lot of questions still need to be answered and that was a fun one just to see
[2:16:16.280 --> 2:16:21.240]  dad really simply with something that is a pet project of his and to finally see it put on the
[2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:25.080]  air and to see you know to see the the pride that he had that he was able to get a show like that
[2:16:25.080 --> 2:16:31.160]  on the air great great episode and i mean they're all fun they all have had moments of just you
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:36.440]  know fantastic candidness and from you know and great stories and great interviews and
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:40.760]  things like that which is all you can ask for you're kind of put together a you know a television
[2:16:40.760 --> 2:16:47.480]  show well we don't we don't know yet if it's going to be picked up again but uh talking to your
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:53.080]  father and others i mean with the type of top rating success it's gotten for the channel
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:58.840]  something's going on if conspiracy theory with jessie ventura doesn't get picked up for a second
[2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:03.720]  larger season well you never know i mean we hit the builder bergs pretty hard and if they don't
[2:17:03.720 --> 2:17:09.080]  all the kids never know but um no ratings are good and you know the key is that thing i want to
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:13.720]  leave your fans of the show and you believe in the show you know don't be afraid to write true tv
[2:17:13.720 --> 2:17:18.440]  and let them know you want to see a second season you know uh i can give you their address right

[2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:07.480]  then you know write them and let them know but it uh you know i don't know we'll find out last
[2:18:07.480 --> 2:18:12.040]  episodes tonight hopefully get some good ratings tonight and go out with it go out with a bang and
[2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:20.920]  and then we'll see what happens tyrell separately guaranteed uh this will be big on dvd i hope you
[2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:29.000]  guys make a three disc set and it needs to be in stores uh is there a movement towards getting a dvd
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:34.280]  of the show out i'm sure there will be i mean i can't wait i haven't we haven't talked about it
[2:18:34.280 --> 2:18:37.800]  quite yet because we're just kind of finishing up with the season i'm sure in the next few months
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:41.400]  that that discussion will come up and you know i can't wait for people i mean there was a lot of
[2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:46.440]  stuff you only get an hour you know to tell each story which is actually not about 45 minutes in
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:52.040]  tv time and you know that there's a lot of stuff we had to put on the editing floor that that we
[2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:55.720]  wish we could put in but that the takeout so hopefully in the dvd said that we could include
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:18:59.480]  some of that and also then i just you know the more people that have it in their hand the more
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:04.600]  people that share it and then you know learn the truth the better and plus this is groundbreaking
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:10.920]  hollywood uh as uh michael breverman said on this show is run by an old guard they want to keep it
[2:19:10.920 --> 2:19:17.480]  in the left right paradigm uh michael is really a smart guy he understands all this and uh this
[2:19:17.480 --> 2:19:23.480]  is groundbreaking if this is successful which it has been it shifts the paradigm and so many high
[2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:27.320]  powered hollywood people they don't want to be liberals they don't want to be conservatives they
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:31.800]  want to get into reality and what's really happening and and and so a lot of people are
[2:19:31.800 --> 2:19:36.360]  watching to see what happens with this show so they can start going public and going public
[2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:42.280]  with their own projects it's a revolution against the controlled paradigm going on in hollywood
[2:19:42.280 --> 2:19:47.240]  right now and you guys are and of course me involved as well are right in the middle of it
[2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:53.640]  this is so wonderful that this has turned out this good this professional this true uh to the
[2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:59.000]  reality uh and it's it's just such a good thing tyrell we're going to come back talk more about

[2:25:05.400 --> 2:25:09.960]  to to begin and see that you know in every emergency situation and you know and all the
[2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:13.800]  government board you know and all their files and where they you know and then they're um

[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:25.240]  to the citizenry and it's very frightening to think about that and then that's what we get into
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:32.600]  this uh into this episode and we also you know uncover uh some some massive uh underground
[2:25:32.600 --> 2:25:38.680]  facilities and other such places right underneath your nose uh and it's it's it's a fun episode
[2:25:38.680 --> 2:25:45.480]  you know watching jesse go uh go bunker busting and we'll leave it at that believe me i think
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:51.080]  this is one of the strongest episodes what what episode really is your favorite uh like i said
[2:25:51.080 --> 2:25:56.920]  probably 9 11 uh and global warming was interesting too because i'd never you know i always assume
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.080]  that the global warming was real and like we say in the show we were not debating the science of
[2:26:01.080 --> 2:26:05.720]  whether it's real or not we just are debating of our our the ideas that have been presented
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:11.800]  uh to help stop this this problem you know are they really going to stop the problem or
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:16.600]  they're just going to make the wealthy more wealthy and then make people rich yeah personally
[2:26:16.600 --> 2:26:21.720]  my favorite episode uh is the global warming because you just destroyed them you have been
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:27.080]  santer i mean that i mean that made newspaper news that he admitted the head of the un program
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:32.920]  that they took out five scientists who in the report said man is not causing global warming
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:39.720]  and and the un knew that 10 years ago on top of climate gate that is as big as the emails
[2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:45.640]  oh it's fantastic i mean the timing of that episode what was going on in the world at that
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:49.640]  moment was i could have been more couldn't have been better you know it was just one of those
[2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:55.000]  those great moments in time where you're on top of a story as another class of the story breaks
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:59.880]  and i won't they don't i was very critical at first like global warming come on guys really
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.960]  like and then you know as the more research we did the more i was convinced that yeah there's
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:08.520]  definitely definitely something sneaky going on there you know and and and you know hopefully
[2:27:08.520 --> 2:27:12.840]  the more people you get talking about these issues the more we can try to change it and that's the
[2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:17.320]  whole point of doing shows like this but you know get you talking get you aware of what's going on
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:22.840]  around you not just being spoon fed everything you see on talent and when you see those i didn't
[2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:27.400]  open i have to say i didn't really open my dad's eyes up to the world of conspiracy theory he
[2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:33.720]  definitely did that when he took me to see the movie jfk when i was a little kid uh like 10 11
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:39.560]  years old so he definitely opened it up to that i was able to kind of open his eyes up to the 9 11
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  because you know like all of us were kind of shocked and had our had our head in the standard
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:49.400]  certain degree uh after that it happened and then at first you was real hesitant to buy in but then
[2:27:49.400 --> 2:27:53.640]  i just kept saying just watch the blues change watch this it raises enough questions it'll make
[2:27:53.640 --> 2:27:59.320]  you think about it and then that kind of got him got him rolling on 9 11 and then opened up you know
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:04.600]  really that got him rolling and then creating this show to a certain extent because it kind of opened
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:11.160]  his mind up to other vast you know the other conspiracies out there uh beyond just jfk well
[2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:15.640]  sure tyrell but i mean talking to your dad the last time he was down here in austin with me for a
[2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:20.680]  few days i mean he said he knew about jfk he knew about some of the things but that you had brought
[2:28:20.680 --> 2:28:25.640]  him so many books and evidence and material and then i'd given him material and then all of that
[2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:29.480]  uh that he went down to mexico and spent months and months reading and watching and all and
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:35.240]  doing research and then he really had this awakening you know to a higher level of of
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:41.480]  information and then you guys had just gotten back from harp in alaska when i hooked up with
[2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:46.120]  you guys at the hotel there in la and i was talking to your dad and he said alex my head
[2:28:46.120 --> 2:28:51.640]  spinning when i lay down at night it's literally spinning and and opening up and that's the same
[2:28:51.640 --> 2:28:56.840]  process that all of us go through even when we think we know what's going on even when we think
[2:28:56.840 --> 2:29:01.560]  we're aware of the new world order and the and the shadow government it just gets more and more
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:09.880]  crazy uh and and this microcosm of the underground bases how there's this giant archipelago of
[2:29:09.880 --> 2:29:14.840]  underground bases and continuity of government facilities that are even on record do exist
[2:29:14.840 --> 2:29:20.040]  imagine what we don't know exist and the general public has no idea all this is going on beneath
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:24.680]  them i know and they have no idea that most of their taxpayers is paying for all the most of
[2:29:24.680 --> 2:29:29.240]  their tax when you're paying for all of you know i mean you want to know what you're buying and
[2:29:29.240 --> 2:29:33.480]  what i mean they're taking your money to do all this and to run this this these regimes that do
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:37.560]  this uh you know not to mention you know the spelling of drugs you know not to mention this
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:42.280]  bia selling the drugs of the cities you know the inner city streets and all of that i mean you
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:46.680]  know they're totally abusing you i mean it's no different than when the you know feudal lords were
[2:29:46.680 --> 2:29:53.640]  abusing the serfs you know back in the 1300s we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:30:04.600 --> 2:30:09.720]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:14.600]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:30:14.600 --> 2:30:20.280]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:30:20.280 --> 2:30:24.680]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:30:24.680 --> 2:30:29.960]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:34.440]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:39.800]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance

[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:46.840]  the production 1-800-259-9231-1800-2599231 tyrell i want to get into your dad and uh politics but
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:51.560]  before we do that i've been asking the questions here any other points or ideas you were getting
[2:34:51.560 --> 2:34:56.680]  into government drug dealing how many times they've been caught ci aircraft crashing full of cocaine
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:01.240]  and you got cut off by the break any you know more statements on that or anything else you want to
[2:35:01.240 --> 2:35:06.120]  say to the audience the thing i want to say too is don't like i you know i read the talkback
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:10.040]  section on the facebook page for the conspiracy theory show you know for our show and like all
[2:35:10.040 --> 2:35:14.520]  of that and and you know i've gotten a lot of mail you know to the to the company to the production
[2:35:14.520 --> 2:35:19.720]  office you know people you know telling us look i've uncovered this or i've found that and you
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:24.120]  know and we do take that seriously i mean if we do get picked up for a second season we need
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:28.120]  materials so if you're you know if you have anything out there that you've uncovered or you
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:33.960]  think of you know don't be afraid to send it to us you know um you know it it's it's interviewing
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:37.720]  people out there and finding the truth of stories is what's going to help us if you've got a little
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:43.320]  nugget of information about something that maybe you or you yourself are afraid to bring the public
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:47.640]  you know we can we can do that if we get picked up you know and that's why you got to watch a show
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:51.560]  and write the true tv and then you know get us picked up for a second season so we can keep
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:56.280]  tell the truth on you know we got alex doing on the radio and in dvds and if we can keep doing it
[2:35:56.280 --> 2:36:00.360]  on tv you know that creates the ground as well and hopefully you can change the world that way
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:06.600]  well there's no doubt that there's a huge awakening taking place and you guys were already aware of
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:13.000]  that but producing the show being out there on the street really plunging with both feet into
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:18.680]  the alternative media and bringing it to mainstream media building that bridge this is unprecedented
[2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:25.480]  trailblazing uh avant garde event that we've all witnessed and i've just been honored to be involved
[2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:31.640]  in it uh what has it been like truly immersing yourself in this uh tyrell well i mean it's
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:36.920]  like you say your head starts spinning after a while and it it's it's it's tough sometimes to
[2:36:36.920 --> 2:36:41.560]  to you know decipher you know which person's telling you the truth which person is and um
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:46.600]  um you know whose side should you take in this in this you know who's who's got the more the most
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:51.800]  information that that's on the end on any on any subject that's going to fit right um for the show
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:56.040]  and the style of showing the editing i mean it was a it was a tough long thing to put together you
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:37:00.600]  know i mean you're out there you know interviewing people setting jessie up to alaska going all over
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:06.680]  the place and you know the government's not being helpful at all and you know stuff it was uh it was
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:11.480]  just it was a fun shoot to do a work with great people all around and uh jessie had a great time
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:16.280]  doing it but uh yeah your head starts spinning after a while because you know you get so you
[2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:21.480]  know inundated with the information but but you get it you just kind of gotta pick the best one
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:25.480]  that you got right there and go with them i mean we had so much more information on each of these
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:30.440]  subjects that we could put in that we only have an hour you know to talk about so you kind of
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:36.440]  gotta just grab the best things you can and then and hope for the best you know um i haven't i haven't
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:41.640]  talked to your dad the last three weeks since he left to get down to mexico uh talking to him or
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:46.920]  talking to him over email down there uh he was super excited when i talked to him three weeks ago
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:53.320]  is he even more excited now that the ratings have just continued of course he's excited i mean we're
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:58.360]  now we're just kind of all waiting to see him and hope we get picked up and uh you know but yeah he
[2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:04.040]  loves the show and is very happy with it you know and and you know a lot of like i say a lot of love
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:10.120]  the true tv they never once you know really stepped in and said no you can't talk about this or yes you
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:14.920]  can't you know i mean then they were very hands-off you know i mean you know and then they're very
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:19.640]  good very good company to work for a single base with productions which is the production company
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:24.520]  to put it together uh you know great people to work for like i say very hands-off surprising
[2:38:24.520 --> 2:38:29.160]  if i was expecting you know the worst and you get into like you know media conglomerates and you
[2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:32.600]  know their own bite turner and all that you mean you never know what you're going to get into but
[2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:39.000]  they were they were fantastic to work with and uh well i was involved i was involved in a big
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:45.640]  production for Discovery Channel with the director who did some kind of monster brothers keeper
[2:38:45.640 --> 2:38:50.840]  and a lot of other top documentary films i mean the very top of the genre and he said i've never
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:56.360]  seen this in 20 plus years of filmmaking the whole show was done executives came in and said we're
[2:38:56.360 --> 2:39:04.920]  not doing this anti-new world order stuff 3.4 million dollar budget killed the entire program
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:11.560]  and i've seen that over and over again where the system does do this but talking to your dad and
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:18.440]  other people in the production they say that his personality his gravitas his research you know
[2:39:18.440 --> 2:39:23.560]  proving it you know he told true tv you know i'm going in to just find the truth i have an open
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:28.680]  mind he found the truth it's our perspective because we are telling the truth and it is the
[2:39:28.680 --> 2:39:35.560]  first national television show that actually comes from the reality perspective and so how
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:42.360]  do you think this got on air i think it got on there i mean i think a that the tv you know
[2:39:42.360 --> 2:39:47.640]  believed in jesse and and you know had the guts you know the executives up there had the guts to
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:51.160]  say you know let's take a gamble on this and let's take a chance but but there's an audience out
[2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:55.160]  there for this which we found that there is uh and also i think you know we probably got
[2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:59.640]  in under the radar a little bit you know jesse hadn't really been on the public guy for a while and
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:05.480]  you know i think we flipped it by him in terms of the the you know the media lead and the powers
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:09.240]  of three i think we kind of flipped this one by him but you know the great thing about about
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:16.440]  hollywood and television and all of that is as much as they will push an agenda they still love money
[2:40:16.440 --> 2:40:21.640]  and in tv it's advertising dollars so you know like you say the more people that watch the show
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:25.160]  and more people that want it on the air want this kind of information out there you know you
[2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:29.480]  got to write in film to pick this up for the second please um because you know they'll follow
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:35.720]  they'll follow money before they'll follow well it comes first there is no doubt that if you put
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:43.640]  this on prime time cbs abc nbc or fox that this would be a number one show and uh i know there's
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:48.600]  been some discussion down the road i mean we need to get another season on cable but this
[2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:53.800]  needs to go to prime time television now i don't think the powers that be are going to let that
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:41:00.440]  happen who knows i mean that that prime time television is so locked into you know sitcoms
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:05.560]  that mean nothing and everything else but you know and you know murder investigation stories
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:10.040]  that aren't true you know that's the great thing about being you know on on true tv and working
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:14.760]  with them is you know we feel and like it says we can not you know we feel in uh not reality
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:19.480]  but actuality you know and it's a great network to work this is a real perry mason i mean you
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:24.680]  guys go out into a real investigation you know we're not you know we're not csi out there pretending
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:28.200]  with you know fake dead body these are real issues we're dealing with the real and you know real
[2:41:28.200 --> 2:41:32.840]  people we're interviewing you know and uh that's what's so fun about the show is you know going
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:38.040]  into play that meeting you know meeting them both a man who says he's a mensurian candidate you know
[2:41:38.040 --> 2:41:42.680]  i shook his hand i talked to him and i i don't know if he's telling the truth or not but i can
[2:41:42.680 --> 2:41:47.880]  tell you this is that he believes in what he's saying well we know those programs are real you
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:53.160]  know and and and we know he had the car wreck and suddenly remembered all of this and that's exactly
[2:41:53.160 --> 2:42:00.440]  in the real cases how this has happened i mean cia officers like olson died in these mind control
[2:42:00.440 --> 2:42:05.400]  programs i mean this is declassified oh yeah yeah and and you know but to get out there and meet
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:09.800]  those people and then and you know and you know i just i hope you know i can't wait for another
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:13.400]  season because there's a lot of other stories out there that we weren't able to get this this time
[2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:17.640]  around and you know like i say you know and get a good good good ratings tonight and everything

[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:23.080]  i know it's a it's a deluge shifting gears um i have congressman on i have political analysts
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:29.800]  on every week i have top reporters on people that really understand politics the political
[2:43:29.800 --> 2:43:35.080]  landscape the republicans have no credibility the democrats have no credibility no matter who
[2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:41.000]  we put in the office governments get bigger the wars get bigger our freedoms get attacked the
[2:43:41.000 --> 2:43:46.520]  banks are looting us the democrats and republicans in all the major polls don't want the government
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:52.280]  takeover of health care they found out it's not free health care no such animal it's a boondoggle
[2:43:53.880 --> 2:43:58.280]  to the insurance companies even howard dean head of the democratic party is saying that
[2:43:58.280 --> 2:44:04.440]  that so people are really angry and every time i talk to political strategist they see no one
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:13.720]  out there with the name recognition uh or uh who has the dark horse history and the and the populist
[2:44:13.720 --> 2:44:21.560]  backing to run for president except for ron paul and jesse ventura and some people say ron paul
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:29.160]  almost 75 uh will be you know 77 if you got elected that that's too old i think he's in great shape
[2:44:29.160 --> 2:44:34.040]  jogs every day exercises i don't think that's the case i love ron paul i supporting i know
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:41.720]  governor ventura uh is is really waking up truly uh you know just gets better and better like fine
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:47.720]  wine as he politically grows he's a real guy he keeps his word he doesn't want special interest
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:53.000]  he can't be bought off the media is demonizing for that he was against the war right when it first
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:57.240]  happened when many others were for it and then later said they were against it you know i mean
[2:44:57.240 --> 2:45:02.440]  he's been right on so many issues i disagree with him on a few but you know uh everybody disagrees
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:08.040]  with you know with each other nobody agrees 100 but but all these experts and myself included
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:14.280]  think that and i know he wants to have his own life he said alex when you get at the age i am
[2:45:14.280 --> 2:45:21.640]  am that that time becomes the most valuable thing not money not fame not even you know he said i just
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:26.680]  want to do the right thing i'm torn between being politically involved with all the nastiness
[2:45:26.680 --> 2:45:30.840]  that happened to be around all the crooks in washington you know if i do do it i would purely
[2:45:30.840 --> 2:45:35.640]  do it if the people are ready and want a true revolution back to the constitution you know
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:40.040]  these are the private discussions we've had we've had some on air can you tell us as much as you
[2:45:40.040 --> 2:45:45.560]  can about what your dad's really thinking what he's doing he's got to know that he's being looked at
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:54.200]  to run for president and that he's needed uh tyrell ventura you know he does know that and he does
[2:45:54.200 --> 2:45:58.920]  and he does you know cure the cure the people out there and there's numerous websites and things
[2:45:58.920 --> 2:46:04.520]  you know asking you know just so you're running 2012 and you know we need you and that kind of thing
[2:46:04.520 --> 2:46:10.040]  and then um you know i can tell you this my father's a big believer in fate that if fate opens
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:14.760]  his door and says you know looks like he puts him in a position where he's going to run for president
[2:46:14.760 --> 2:46:20.760]  he might but ultimately i don't think that's on his mind right now he's not he's not shown me anything
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:25.160]  behind closed doors that said that he does the site seven the presidency if anything he wants to serve
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:30.520]  more and then continue to work on the television show uh but you know it's a strange funny world
[2:46:30.520 --> 2:46:35.720]  we live in and you never know what can happen but uh as of right now noise he doesn't have any
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:41.880]  political ambitions right now except for just waking people up and continue to be a voice of
[2:46:41.880 --> 2:46:48.040]  independence and a voice of revolution well that's what he's told me and people always ask me to run
[2:46:48.040 --> 2:46:53.880]  for office and and the reason i've said i will probably never do it is that i can be pure here
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:58.520]  nobody's telling me what to say i can do whatever i want i can tell the truth i can feel good when
[2:46:58.520 --> 2:47:04.920]  i go to bed at night and politics itself is inherently corrupting inherently is about compromise
[2:47:04.920 --> 2:47:11.160]  and your dad knows he can write books he can do tv and radio interviews he can't have a hit tv show
[2:47:11.160 --> 2:47:17.000]  telling the truth trailblazing and that and that he wants to be from the grassroots part of the
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:23.880]  revolution against tyranny with the people as a foot soldier as a commando as a navy seal that's
[2:47:23.880 --> 2:47:30.760]  that's what he sees is that front line general out there you know on the front lines in the fight
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:36.360]  you know what it is alex is it one of the greatest experiences he ever had in his life was teaching
[2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:41.400]  political science at harvard you know and they hadn't come out there for for a semester at harvard
[2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:47.000]  and was able to teach all these young kids about third party politics and about uh you know 9-11
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:52.440]  and about jfk and things like that and and he was able to really you know kind of those are the
[2:47:52.440 --> 2:47:55.800]  people that are going to change the world that thing my dad's kind of getting to a point in his
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:47:59.960]  life now where he would rather inspire the person who is going to change the world rather than change
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:04.280]  the world that he's taken it as you know pretty far now and he's gone you know from governor and
[2:48:04.280 --> 2:48:09.240]  everything else but you know i think uh you know as he gets up there he wants to surf more he kind
[2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:13.960]  of wants to pass the reins on so you know hopefully uh you know there's someone out there who will
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:18.760]  have that career and will have that that that third party know how to uh you know take take this
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:22.840]  country back for us and uh but it starts with all of us it doesn't take one person you can't
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:27.880]  fill your well just one person tyrell i want to hold you tyrell i want to hold you five minutes
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:32.040]  in the next hour if you can so we have two two short segments to be able to take calls you can
[2:48:32.040 --> 2:48:39.400]  do that can't you of course okay great we're going to come back and go to uh noel mark rose ron tim
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:45.480]  and others for tyrell ventura specifically on the show or jesse ventura or on tyrell but i just
[2:48:45.480 --> 2:48:50.360]  want to say this here as we go to break studying the founding fathers they weren't perfect they were
[2:48:50.360 --> 2:48:54.600]  men but they had good hearts and they were intelligent and they truly wanted liberty
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:49:01.000]  george washington thomas jefferson and those are icons those are my idols and really getting to know
[2:49:01.000 --> 2:49:07.720]  your dad and studying now in hindsight what he's done in his life and knowing that he doesn't want
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:13.880]  to be president he doesn't want the power he doesn't want uh to have the attention and be at all the
[2:49:13.880 --> 2:49:20.280]  big dinners he just wants freedom that's just like george washington who uh you know turned in his
[2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:25.320]  command they wanted him to be king he said no and then they basically drafted him to run for president
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:29.240]  and all he wanted to do was get back to mount vernon he wanted to leave new york and and and you
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:34.440]  know go back to where washington dc is today is his farm and so that's exactly why we need your dad
[2:49:34.440 --> 2:49:38.920]  to run for president because i genuinely looked into his eyes he doesn't want to do it because he
[2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:44.760]  doesn't want to be around all that corrupt slime and and he just wants to be a common person but
[2:49:44.760 --> 2:49:49.880]  then he wants to run because he knows he wants to put real issues out imagine all these scumbag
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:54.920]  politicians they would kill their children to be president and that's why we don't want them to be
[2:49:54.920 --> 2:49:59.640]  president ron paul doesn't want to run for president i've talked to him privately he wants to but he
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:04.760]  fights tirelessly because of duty your dad doesn't want to be president but he does want to stop the
[2:50:04.760 --> 2:50:09.960]  new world order yes yes of course you know like yeah now completely you know you couldn't have said
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:14.120]  the best you don't could have said it any better that's you know he just wants to continue his
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:18.680]  right and to open people's minds up and get people thinking you know thinking of third party don't
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:22.760]  fall into the left or the right you know be your own be your own person be an independent thinker
[2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:26.920]  you know study the founding fathers you know learn what they created here in this great great
[2:50:26.920 --> 2:50:31.080]  country we have you know and then don't let it fall into the hands of the roots of the corrupt
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:37.240]  well your dad really does with all of his colorful history and all the great things he's done as a
[2:50:37.240 --> 2:50:42.760]  trailblazer the fact that he doesn't want power the fact that he just wants to be on a lonely
[2:50:42.760 --> 2:50:49.240]  seashore by himself reading books that's why he needs to be president or somebody like ron paul
[2:50:49.240 --> 2:50:55.880]  instead of sarah palin and and the democrats and the republic all these painted trolopes and trumpets

[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:50.920]  calls but tyrell during the break you made a statement that was uh not conclusive but closer
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:57.400]  to conclusive so finish up that statement about your dad well essentially they say this like you
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:02.360]  know you asked me is he going for president 2012 and things like that and i say you know right now
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:09.320]  i would say i'm probably 85% sure that he's not going to run for president however uh you know
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:15.000]  his life has been so dynamic and strange but you know you never can stay never with him uh so you
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:21.400]  know who knows uh you know uh if you just told me that we have the conspiracy theory show on
[2:55:21.400 --> 2:55:25.240]  and we're getting great ratings uh a year ago i just said like oh no way they never put it on
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:30.040]  but they did he told me he was gonna run for governor and when i just said no way but he did
[2:55:30.040 --> 2:55:35.800]  so you never know you never know with him but uh but uh as of right now doesn't look like he's
[2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:42.120]  running but but uh you know never say never there you go ladies and gentlemen jesse wants to ride
[2:55:42.120 --> 2:55:46.840]  off into the sunset with his tv show and tell the younger generation take your country back but
[2:55:46.840 --> 2:55:52.040]  he might still run for president uh noel in ohio you're on the air with tyrell ventura
[2:55:52.920 --> 2:55:58.760]  alex tyrell pleasure to talk to you a little nervous sorry but uh i've been reading the
[2:55:58.760 --> 2:56:04.920]  grillin news network's book uh true lies and you're mentioned in it and uh i thought it would be a
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:12.280]  good idea for maybe uh second season show to do a show on the depleted uranium that though we're
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:19.400]  giving the uh uh troops is ammunition that is a great subject because the army's own manuals
[2:56:19.400 --> 2:56:25.480]  admitted skip tyrell that's a fantastic subject i just saw i just saw a piece about that the other
[2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:29.480]  day that was it was devastating you know what's happening over there from that from using those
[2:56:29.480 --> 2:56:33.880]  and weaponry and things like that why are we you know there's no reason for excuse depleted uranium
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:39.560]  and weapon well it's a toxic waste just like fluoride's a toxic waste they put it in the water
[2:56:39.560 --> 2:56:45.000]  it's a toxic waste from uh spent fuel rods at newt plants so they put it into weaponry when the
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:49.160]  army's own manuals in the 80s so this will kill you deader in the hammer if you breathe it now
[2:56:49.160 --> 2:56:57.000]  they say oh no it's good for you that's as typical you know it's it's the corporation
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:57:00.520]  trying to get rid of its toxic waste so they figure out we can sell it to the military they have
[2:57:00.520 --> 2:57:05.080]  good use for it and then they always wrap themselves in the flag but they could really
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:10.440]  care less about these troops of course now they don't care no that day it's sad when when you when
[2:57:10.440 --> 2:57:14.680]  you you know you see these young kids going over there my generation and younger you know going
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:20.680]  over to iraq and there's you know fourth fifth sixth two or now it's not eighth uh you know being
[2:57:20.680 --> 2:57:24.840]  used completely as corporate pawns you know it's it's terrible no anything else
[2:57:24.840 --> 2:57:32.520]  knows gone mark and oregon quickly go ahead more than alex and tyrell i want to congratulate
[2:57:32.520 --> 2:57:37.640]  you both on your very successful expose of evil here and uh the dark side
[2:57:39.560 --> 2:57:47.800]  i'd like to make a quick comment and ask a question um i think your dad tyrell and ron paul
[2:57:48.520 --> 2:57:54.040]  interchangeably on the ticket i don't know which would uh be vice president or president but
[2:57:54.040 --> 2:57:58.600]  that would certainly gather in a lot of people between the uh independent type of
[2:57:59.480 --> 2:58:05.560]  voter as well as a republican voter and perhaps quite a few democrats something to think about
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:11.800]  at any rate i wanted to ask you tyrell do you have any knowledge of um turner broadcasting
[2:58:11.800 --> 2:58:18.120]  ted turner's uh conglomerate actually having ownership or a large interest in the true tv
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:23.240]  network uh it hurt again i don't have i don't have knowledge of i mean i i know that there's yeah he
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:28.360]  doesn't have a controlling interest he's he's now out of the decision-making process in those companies
[2:58:28.920 --> 2:58:33.160]  obviously i think it's just called turner broadcasting just because that's the name of it
[2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:36.760]  yeah i mean he's been he's been out of decision-making process for five six years
[2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:40.040]  but it doesn't matter it's globalist above the globalist

[2:59:53.400 --> 2:59:58.600]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:59:58.600 --> 3:00:11.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[3:00:12.280 --> 3:00:20.600]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:28.120]  i have thought long and hard about why this show was allowed on air how the show is from our
[3:00:28.120 --> 3:00:33.480]  perspective and proves the government's doing all this evil stuff because that's what ventura
[3:00:33.480 --> 3:00:38.760]  found and why is it on air they know they've got a mix a little bit of this in they can't just fully
[3:00:38.760 --> 3:00:45.480]  ignore it it's gotten too big too many people know so they put it on true tv and also they know
[3:00:45.480 --> 3:00:50.200]  it's very popular so they'll make money they think so little of you it's just right out in the open
[3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:54.680]  but i think they've miscalculated it's also titrating the dose it's like people that are around
[3:00:54.680 --> 3:01:00.360]  cobras they take small amounts of the venom until they get immune to it and the elite are slowly
[3:01:00.360 --> 3:01:04.520]  kind of like they've admitted world government now but i think they've miscalculated i mean it
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:10.440]  it's hurting them worse to ignore it all because then people say well why are they hiding it i
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:14.040]  think they're just trying to put it right out in the open tyrell you think that's a good assessment
[3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:18.920]  oh i think i think i think it's bad and also yeah i think that you know they kind of feel
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:22.440]  that you know that we'll let them talk about this and have this little corner and you know
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:26.200]  they're never going to be a threat to us but yeah the more the more people are talking about it the
[3:01:26.200 --> 3:01:30.200]  more people are exposed to the truth you know that that will get that ball rolling and get
[3:01:30.200 --> 3:01:35.320]  this you know get take our take our liberty back take our country back you know and uh and stop
[3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:40.440]  programs like you know mentoring and candidate programs you know stop being pleased for our money
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:47.480]  and you know find out what the government has uh is plans and backup plans in case of a catastrophe
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:52.360]  on an epic scale you know how is it going to save its people ask questions with your government
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:57.320]  uh absolutely i'm gonna try one whole thing that we have you know absolutely i'm gonna try to jam

[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:09.160]  hi alex and tyrell um first-time caller alex i want to thank you very much because without your
[3:02:09.160 --> 3:02:14.040]  tireless efforts i don't think any of this would be possible and for the first time in three years
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:20.280]  since i became awake i'm starting to feel hopeful because you know you just keep pummeling pummeling
[3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:25.640]  pummeling exactly we now are having victory look at copenhagen setting up world government going
[3:02:25.640 --> 3:02:31.240]  down in flames we're having victory on every level tyrell i agree you know like i said the more
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:35.880]  people talking about it the more the more you know programs like alex has listened to shows like
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:40.520]  our watched in the book the more you get that piece of truth out there what people hang on to it
[3:02:40.520 --> 3:02:45.160]  you know or at least just a different opinion and even if you don't believe anything that we're
[3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:50.200]  saying at least just listen to you have different opinions in your life momentum is shifting towards

[3:03:02.280 --> 3:03:07.400]  this would not be possible and today was yesterday was the first day that i felt really hopeful
[3:03:07.400 --> 3:03:16.360]  when you know your program on what was going on with um tarp and aig and um european media
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:21.480]  bursting loose on each one in one okay and i and i thank you so much because i don't think

[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:35.400]  health council has said it was all a fraud dangerous vaccine to make money again we've
[3:03:35.400 --> 3:03:41.800]  been purely vindicated tyrell so much is coming out now the government's being just absolutely
[3:03:41.800 --> 3:03:47.800]  discredited oh yeah yeah i mean i mean there's you can find the truth that i mean every every
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:52.040]  like news i news article they put out you know build you know i was trading their end or what
[3:03:52.040 --> 3:03:56.520]  they want you to believe you can find an alternate viewpoint and like i said it's even if you don't
[3:03:56.520 --> 3:04:01.160]  believe every every alternate viewpoint you come across you know you have to leave yourself open it
[3:04:01.160 --> 3:04:06.120]  shouldn't just be a right or left debate you know you know you can't just be spoon-fed your whole
[3:04:06.120 --> 3:04:10.280]  life it's okay to be a free thinker even if you're proven wrong you could have a great theory or a
[3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:14.680]  great you know could like we've tracked down many conspiracies that ended up being dead ends or
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:19.400]  facts ended up being untrue so we had to move in a different direction but that's the nature
[3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:25.400]  investigations the nature of good uh public discourse you know is is being able to have
[3:04:25.400 --> 3:04:31.800]  all sorts of viewpoints presented well said tyrell ventura great job on the show and i want to be

[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:13.400]  just like third world nations have been taken over is being taken over by offshore banks the people
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:18.600]  are saying no now the banks are backing off saying well maybe we had assets we didn't tell you about
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:23.640]  and you don't owe that much it's all made up if they can win their fight there it will send a

[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:54.120]  have uh bergita uh jones dot here on with us thank you so much for coming on well thanks for having
[3:09:54.120 --> 3:10:00.520]  me uh however i have to correct one thing about the banks uh the bank that we are supposed to
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:08.040]  be covering was a privately run bank by icelanders uh with the investments in the derivatives yes of
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:14.760]  course uh so we were basically conned the entire nation was conned and the thing is that the
[3:10:14.760 --> 3:10:22.600]  brits and the dutch they want us to pay back um with huge interest so they're actually making money
[3:10:22.600 --> 3:10:28.280]  of us money that never reached island and most islanders had never heard of these accounts
[3:10:28.280 --> 3:10:34.840]  before everything collapsed and they put the the terrorist law on us almost like guinea pigs
[3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:41.400]  because they had not tried to use that particular terror act law and instead of putting it on the
[3:10:41.400 --> 3:10:46.760]  bank in the beginning which was privately owned they put it on island and actually during our
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:52.280]  incredible system almost the entire system collapsed when all the big banks collapsed
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:58.520]  they decided to put the terrorist act on us so we were we were very close to not having food in
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:03.880]  island amazing now start at the beginning for people that don't understand what's happening
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:10.520]  and why this is so important globally with what happened in island the chain of events and now
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:16.600]  the incredible fight you and others are leading against the banking cartel literally turning
[3:11:16.600 --> 3:11:23.960]  your country into a vassal state through economic fraudulent uh conquest well it all happened uh
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:29.480]  a few years ago all the big banks were actually government owned or the people owned them uh
[3:11:29.480 --> 3:11:35.800]  and we had a conservative party run island for 18 years and during that period they basically
[3:11:35.800 --> 3:11:41.640]  privatized everything the people owned including the banks a few years ago and they sold the banks
[3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:48.360]  relatively cheaply to friends and allies um and they made in a very short period of time all the
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:55.240]  legislation vanished uh that would have them uh you know having to not expand as quickly as they did
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:12:02.200]  they became five times bigger than the annual gtp and so when they collapsed you can imagine
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:12.920]  how huge blow it was for the nation now today in island there's been what almost a year of
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:18.520]  protest and people taking over government buildings and saying no and a key vote is coming up by the
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:23.160]  people of island on whether or not you're going to capitulate to this fraud can you walk us through
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:31.320]  that is um just around the time when um you know the banking system collapsed uh protest started
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:37.560]  people were actually quite shocked uh because they had been conned um and we wanted to get the
[3:12:37.560 --> 3:12:44.920]  government out of uh office which is impossible by legislation so we had the soft revolution
[3:12:44.920 --> 3:12:51.560]  i drive in the government away um and then when we got a new government uh which apparently is
[3:12:51.560 --> 3:12:58.280]  just like the old one unfortunately with all their secret secrecy and uh bound to the imf
[3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:05.240]  which you know i really think that we need to get a plan beat to get rid of um and there's been
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:10.840]  an ongoing protest and it's growing bigger and bigger again because people are very unhappy
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:15.480]  with the way the new government is handling things even though it is the first left-wing
[3:13:15.480 --> 3:13:22.760]  government in the history of island um because you can't run left-wing politics with the imf
[3:13:22.760 --> 3:13:31.000]  uh controlling the national budget and uh we've been you know in the parliament that just got
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:36.680]  fresh into parliament uh you know i'm not really a politician by heart and our movement um
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:41.480]  we were created out of all the different grassroots that popped up after the collapse
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:47.640]  and we got just in eight weeks more than seven percent of the vote and we didn't have any money
[3:13:47.640 --> 3:13:54.760]  no big money people behind us just the relentless effort of ordinary people who wanted to build
[3:13:54.760 --> 3:14:01.480]  a bridge between parliament and the people uh so you know when we got into parliament the
[3:14:01.480 --> 3:14:09.800]  i-state dilemma landed in our lap and we found out that they wanted to pass this huge um
[3:14:11.720 --> 3:14:17.240]  burden on the nation without even the parliamentarians seeing the contract between island and
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:25.240]  the dot and the british government so the fight started there and fortunately the the contract
[3:14:25.240 --> 3:14:31.160]  was leaked and that has been a great blessing for us that so much of the material they wanted to hide
[3:14:31.160 --> 3:14:37.400]  from us and the nation has been leaked on sites like wiki leaks and and into the media in island
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:46.600]  uh however we passed we managed to change the contract this summer which was actually um
[3:14:47.560 --> 3:14:52.120]  totally unique in a new way also for other nations that are suffering from you know
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:57.800]  spending all their national budget all the gdp on dispaying interest of foreign debt
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:05.400]  so in the the changes on the bill we managed to put in um that we would never pay more than
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:10.040]  we could handle and of course the british and the dutch did not like that and they demanded
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:18.680]  that we would actually change islandic law in order to uh for them to accept it and our government
[3:15:18.680 --> 3:15:27.080]  decided to listen to them uh unbelievable that they they pushed another bill through with um
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:32.920]  there was a question if they would actually manage to get majority for the night and when
[3:15:32.920 --> 3:15:42.040]  they passed it during that time which was by force uh the nation got up to its feet and um 23
[3:15:42.040 --> 3:15:48.840]  percent of the nation signed the petition asking the president of island who has is the last person
[3:15:48.840 --> 3:15:54.920]  to sign all law to not sign this law and let the nation vote on it so this is the first time in
[3:15:54.920 --> 3:16:00.280]  islandic history since we ruled around becoming a sovereign state when we got out of the danish
[3:16:00.280 --> 3:16:08.120]  colonism in 1944 so it's truly historical and i really hope that we will have the courage to vote
[3:16:08.120 --> 3:16:14.040]  no to this out of courage but not yes out of fear because of course there is a great spin
[3:16:14.040 --> 3:16:18.760]  and that is why it is so important for the ascentic people to feel the support of the people of the
[3:16:18.760 --> 3:16:26.440]  world who are fed up with bailing out the bankers we're talking to beer gita jones dotier a member
[3:16:26.440 --> 3:16:33.240]  of the uh islandic parliament she is also the chairman of her new party that is uh rising to
[3:16:33.240 --> 3:16:39.160]  power there as people see that they're actually standing up for the population against fraud the
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:44.600]  population has been on the edge of near revolt we've played those videos here of people taking
[3:16:44.600 --> 3:16:51.880]  over banks government buildings you know mainline families middle class wealthy people working class
[3:16:51.880 --> 3:16:58.520]  because literally the country was imploded by design food wasn't even coming in
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:05.960]  the export and import in a lot of their food uh just just absolutely hellish so i want to go over
[3:17:06.520 --> 3:17:12.120]  the fact that some news reports have said five times your gdp that the bank went into with
[3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:20.760]  derivative scams uh some have said 10 times gdp you're saying five times gdp and i mean the actual
[3:17:20.760 --> 3:17:26.680]  bondage the financial enslavement to these people and that they were doing it all in secret just
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:32.520]  like our banker takeover in october of 2008 was done in secret and everything else is done in
[3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:39.000]  secret by these banks that form the shadow government so can you speak to uh the type of
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:46.280]  hardship this is created for your country and and uh the the secrecy that these people were trying to
[3:17:46.280 --> 3:17:54.360]  engage in to get your country to shine on to even more tyranny well um what the previous government
[3:17:54.360 --> 3:18:00.280]  managed to do was to trade a law that allowed the banks to maintain complete secrecy of like you know
[3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:08.680]  their their loan books and so forth even if now all the banks especially the bank that controls the
[3:18:08.680 --> 3:18:15.800]  i-save accounts is now uh you know taken over by the government we the parliamentarians can't not even
[3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:22.360]  the the minister of finance has seen what is supposed to be the bond or the own the assets
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:29.880]  but are supposed to cover i-save um and i've asked for it from day one since last summer uh officially
[3:18:29.880 --> 3:18:38.040]  and unofficially and uh they they're just the state within the state um uh the liquidity uh committees
[3:18:39.400 --> 3:18:46.840]  um however i think um people are awakening to the fact and starting to demand more which they
[3:18:46.840 --> 3:18:53.000]  didn't and i think one of the good things about this uh difficult situation which means you know
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:58.280]  there's a lot of people moving away from Iceland there's a wave of there's a huge brain drain already
[3:18:58.280 --> 3:19:06.360]  happening and uh we used to be the fifth richest nation in the world and now we're ranked among the
[3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:13.720]  fourth most likely nation to go bankrupt to go into death moratorium um and you know we had very
[3:19:13.720 --> 3:19:19.240]  little poverty here and the middle there was a very little gap between the rich and poor however
[3:19:19.240 --> 3:19:25.880]  that all changed with the the new billionaires that basically got everything given on a silver platter
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:33.320]  uh and are now responsible for the reason why we're here but like their assets have not been frozen
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:39.080]  yet virgita stay there we're going to come right back to you after this break but this is the story

[3:23:04.280 --> 3:23:09.320]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[3:23:09.320 --> 3:23:14.360]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:19.960]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:25.080]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:30.360]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[3:23:30.360 --> 3:23:35.000]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:40.360]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[3:23:40.360 --> 3:23:44.760]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[3:24:08.440 --> 3:24:14.120]  virgita jones dot tier member of the icelandic parliament leading the charge against the bank
[3:24:14.120 --> 3:24:22.200]  or takeover americans are losing their jobs or having their pay cut their savings are being
[3:24:22.200 --> 3:24:28.440]  destroyed we're going through the same process as main street dies as everything is fed into
[3:24:28.440 --> 3:24:34.680]  the big banks but they tell americans oh we've got a great economy so we're in the same boat
[3:24:34.680 --> 3:24:43.400]  as iceland going back to our guest virgita looking at this and the fraud they're engaged in go over
[3:24:43.400 --> 3:24:51.640]  the con for people the type of fraud these banks are engaged in and then tie that in with the spin
[3:24:51.640 --> 3:24:57.160]  they're putting out to counter you and other icelanders that are refusing to become slaves
[3:24:58.920 --> 3:25:06.280]  well i guess the con started relatively sneakily you know because they were sort of
[3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:12.920]  passing loans between the banks with nothing really behind it they were making all these fancy
[3:25:12.920 --> 3:25:20.200]  bundles and stuff like that and i honestly don't have the english terms for it but
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:27.880]  then in the end when they were truly becoming desperate for cash they started con elderly people
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:34.280]  and immigrants asking them to move their savings to a high-risk account saying that they were no
[3:25:34.280 --> 3:25:41.080]  risk accounts and telling them that you know even though it had better interest it would be still
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:47.720]  completely safe for them to save the money there and then they basically rinsed out all that money
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:53.480]  into god knows what probably it's all resting in total islands or something like that
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:02.440]  the spin that's happening right now with the icelandic government and the media it's almost
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:10.680]  shocking it feels like they are you know somehow working with the ducks and the british in order to
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:19.240]  make us submit to their fear mongering because one of the mantras they had in parliament when
[3:26:19.240 --> 3:26:24.840]  they were forcing this bill through was that the iceland would become completely isolated we would
[3:26:24.840 --> 3:26:33.480]  become cuba of the north or simpapua of the north nigeria of the north uh and that you know everybody
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:39.800]  would stop doing business with us we could not get loans anywhere um and our export would be in
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:45.320]  danger nobody would want to invest so financial terrorism we have the same thing here in october
[3:26:45.320 --> 3:26:52.120]  2008 they said you will have martial law you will have a collapsed economy give us unlimited power
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:56.040]  and then now there's talk of criminal charges against geithner and others i mean they're
[3:26:56.040 --> 3:27:02.120]  committing crimes it's the same people that rob does robbed you why not have the people of iceland
[3:27:02.120 --> 3:27:08.200]  swear out warrants and arrest these bankers that engaged in fraud that will end their propaganda
[3:27:08.200 --> 3:27:14.600]  immediately when the people openly see them in irons yeah that's what everybody's waiting for
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:19.800]  there is actually uh i'm i'm on a committee that has just been funded to go through the there's a
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:27.320]  truth commission report coming out early next month and everybody's waiting in anticipation
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:34.200]  about what is going to be in that report i hope that both politicians who were sleeping or openly
[3:27:34.200 --> 3:27:42.680]  engaged in this scam and allowing all the institutions to be laid down or or afforded
[3:27:42.680 --> 3:27:50.600]  uh with new legislation um and the criminals that stole the money and actually the guys that owned
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:58.520]  lunch funky the isave host uh have been openly you know associated with the russian mafia so
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:05.880]  we're dealing with very big elements here and that is why i think that the people in iceland
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:10.920]  needs more than anything to feel that we're not alone in the world that the people of the world
[3:28:10.920 --> 3:28:18.280]  more than anything are behind us and i'm starting an international petition where the only thing
[3:28:18.280 --> 3:28:23.720]  people need to do is just to say that they support us in this quest for freedom from this tyranny
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:30.120]  and blackmail and they've also been using the EU because what the new government did was to apply
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:36.520]  for membership of the european union despite the fact that majority of the nation is not
[3:28:36.520 --> 3:28:42.360]  willing to join it uh and one people have to bear in mind that even though we're very few there are
[3:28:42.360 --> 3:28:49.960]  320 000 people living on the island who is the island is the same size as kentucky um we have
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:57.960]  incredible resources and we are located very strategically for warfare and that's why we had
[3:28:57.960 --> 3:29:04.760]  american base here for you know since the world war second world war until recently uh since the cold
[3:29:04.760 --> 3:29:12.440]  war stopped then we became redundant as a location uh to the great jury of many um but however the
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:19.640]  north pathway uh for ships to travel from asia to to this part of the world you know much shorter
[3:29:19.640 --> 3:29:28.600]  and quicker way is opening so all right stay there stay there member of parliament from iceland
[3:29:28.600 --> 3:29:34.600]  leading the fight against the bankers a bellwether test case they're set to vote very soon on
[3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:38.840]  whether they're going to let the bankers continue their raping uh the bankers are now cornered in
[3:29:38.840 --> 3:29:43.560]  the london guardian reports they're now saying oh guess what you don't owe as much money as we said
[3:29:44.280 --> 3:29:48.200]  the bank has all these assets we're going to talk about that when we come back
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:57.240]  iceland is standing up we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio

[3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:41.880]  capital of iceland is the member of parliament and the chairman of her party uh that is uh really
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:46.840]  getting more and more seats and more more popularity as the people stand up and find their legs against
[3:35:46.840 --> 3:35:53.400]  the bankers uh birgitta jones draughtier again is our guest uh as we went to break i was asking
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:59.160]  the question for people that just joined us now that it looks like iceland's going to vote against
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:02.920]  paying this fraudulent debt to the bankers that have already robbed you they just want more now
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:09.480]  now they go oh suddenly we found all these assets in the bank looks like you don't owe us even though
[3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:15.400]  it's fraudulent owe us as much as we thought so now they're backing off going okay we won't destroy
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:20.920]  you we won't embargo you we won't put blockades up we won't destroy your nation after we already robbed
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:27.000]  it if you just pay us a third of what we wanted uh so again we're showing that these guys are
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:32.600]  paper tigers straw man if you'll just stand up and fight them and leading that fight we are so
[3:36:32.600 --> 3:36:37.560]  honored to have you and we salute you because we're all in this fight together uh please continue
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:43.320]  okay i just want to clarify one thing that the people that are really leading this fight are
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:49.400]  the people of iceland yes and uh yeah but i mean you're you come up and all the major newspapers
[3:36:49.400 --> 3:36:58.120]  around the world and and of anybody you really are the uh the the the the figurehead and and
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:03.960]  a quite well-spoken one as well uh so i mean i mean it's your face they're on the front of the ship
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:10.680]  well in some respects uh but however it's been a lot of people working on this and so i don't
[3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:17.400]  want to take all the credit for it uh one thing that we should also bear in mind when it comes to
[3:37:17.400 --> 3:37:23.480]  the icelandic saga the isaac saga and the entire collapse is that um i actually i met with john
[3:37:23.480 --> 3:37:30.440]  perkins uh last year just before i got uh i left within the parliament and i asked them you know
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:39.480]  what should we do uh to get rid of the imf and uh and he told me that he was the most important
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:44.040]  thing we could do and i think the same applies to you in the states and all over the world is that
[3:37:44.040 --> 3:37:49.720]  you are the creator of your reality and if you want changes you are going to have to do something
[3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:57.880]  okay uh and you know obviously we were hit by an economic hitman i don't know who it is or if
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:03.000]  there were many but it is blatantly obvious and it was very interesting how iceland women were
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:09.320]  actually doing really well they decided to go into the biggest construction uh constructing a huge
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:16.760]  dam uh in order to give alcoa dirt cheap energy that nobody knows the price of and that's one of
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:23.720]  the battles is just to find out how cheap they're getting the energy and the policy of the government
[3:38:23.720 --> 3:38:29.320]  that was previously and the government that was previous to that was basically to sell
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:35.800]  iceland's uh energy dirt cheap uh they were basically pimping iceland uh if you were reading
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:41.960]  if you would read some of the the proposals on getting all the aluminum smelters into iceland
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:51.720]  which is by the way one of the last pristine uh nature uh in europe you would be shocked so
[3:38:51.720 --> 3:38:58.280]  there there are many aspects to this sila uh and we're just in the beginning of understanding
[3:38:58.280 --> 3:39:07.320]  how deep it goes and it will be very interesting to see who are the corrupt people and uh if the
[3:39:07.320 --> 3:39:14.680]  nation has the guts to have them punished in one way or another for how they have sold out our
[3:39:14.680 --> 3:39:21.080]  country and uh and the interesting thing as well is that when the british decided to use the terrorist
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:27.320]  act on iceland um very similar to how you know the chinese took over tibet the tibetans didn't
[3:39:27.320 --> 3:39:33.880]  have any army they had a few people with guns uh that were haptos uh icelanders don't have any army
[3:39:33.880 --> 3:39:39.800]  or military and our cops don't even carry guns so you know it's probably the least threatening
[3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:47.000]  nation in the world to being passed on side by side to uh al-qaeda and and the simpabwe and north
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:54.280]  korea so uh but the thing the lesson to be learned for the rest of the people in the world is that
[3:39:54.280 --> 3:39:58.040]  we are the first one to be hit you could be next
[3:40:01.560 --> 3:40:09.880]  absolutely uh the the establishment is is now moving on to gobbling up first world nations
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:17.400]  they they're doing the same process here uh and uh so so this key vote coming up i mean is iceland
[3:40:17.400 --> 3:40:22.120]  going to be able to not just stop the bankers from robbing you but actually arrest some of these
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:29.320]  criminals or at least put arrest warrants out for them and signify that they are the bad guys i mean
[3:40:29.320 --> 3:40:35.960]  that will destroy them in the pr war uh if they're rightfully indicted for fraud yeah like some of
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:41.560]  them actually still hold the media the main media and they're still allowed to own it it's unbelievable
[3:40:42.520 --> 3:40:47.880]  but i think that we will have another i mean there is a huge wave of anger brewing again
[3:40:47.880 --> 3:40:54.680]  among the nation and if the president would not have allowed us to give us this responsibility
[3:40:54.680 --> 3:41:01.560]  of voting on this particular bill there would have been another revolution and this time i fear it
[3:41:01.560 --> 3:41:09.160]  would have been more violent the other one was relatively soft but if the bankers and the people
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:17.240]  that are responsible for where we are at now are not going to get punished and and put into jail
[3:41:17.240 --> 3:41:22.040]  or you know i would like to see them expelled from iceland forever and ever uh
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:31.480]  then we have we will have another revolution on our hands well i mean what do you call people in
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:36.280]  thousands of demonstrations hundreds i don't every day taking over government buildings
[3:41:36.280 --> 3:41:43.400]  protesting on the streets saying no no no i've seen polls in iceland where the and where the vast
[3:41:43.400 --> 3:41:48.280]  majority are upset and saying they're not going to be part of it can you give us some of those numbers
[3:41:49.640 --> 3:41:55.480]  well when we started protesting uh you know being you know i come from that sort of
[3:41:55.480 --> 3:42:00.040]  grassroots level where i've organized protests and been part of protest for a long time in iceland
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:05.640]  we we were just a handful of us in the beginning there were actually more foreign media than us
[3:42:05.640 --> 3:42:12.840]  however it gradually grew into thousands of people uh and because the numbers you would get
[3:42:12.840 --> 3:42:18.840]  in the aslantic media would be always according to what the police estimated because the media
[3:42:18.840 --> 3:42:23.880]  couldn't bother to go and count it we only got accurate numbers when the foreign media came
[3:42:23.880 --> 3:42:29.640]  and counted the protesters and it was thousands and thousands of people and some of the big protests
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:38.360]  and um and then when we had the you know the soft protest revolution that in the end
[3:42:38.360 --> 3:42:46.680]  uh drove the government away um i don't know there were people protesting day and night and it was
[3:42:46.680 --> 3:42:53.080]  in the middle of winter here it was really cold i had a friend that got monia from standing outside
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:59.000]  and they were doing this um uh they you know they got all these drummers and all these people that
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:04.200]  were banging on pots and pans and it was sort of similar to the revolution in argentina uh the pots
[3:43:04.200 --> 3:43:10.760]  and pans revolution and that is what it was called in iceland it was extremely noisy and it was driving
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:18.280]  the people in the in the parliament crazy um so maybe it was the noise that got them to resign i
[3:43:18.280 --> 3:43:23.320]  don't know but uh but it was getting quite violent they took it was a huge christmas tree outside
[3:43:23.320 --> 3:43:28.680]  parliament that the novidians always give us every christmas and they took that and burned it down and
[3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:34.840]  this sort of protest had not been happening in estonia since uh we joined nato because yeah when
[3:43:34.840 --> 3:43:40.200]  the people started burning burning stuff down the government started backing off yes absolutely
[3:43:40.760 --> 3:43:47.960]  and also the police was attacked uh and um they actually didn't have enough uh maze they were running
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:52.040]  out of maze so they started to use tear gas and stuff and the moral is when people actually
[3:43:52.040 --> 3:43:57.080]  finally get mad and take action nothing no amount of swat teams no amount of garbage
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:02.360]  can stop them and people always forget in revolution the power of fire and i'm not saying that's
[3:44:02.360 --> 3:44:09.320]  something that needs to go on here but i mean look a true revolutionary force cannot be stopped
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:14.440]  when it's got right on its side and so now they're backing off uh also people took over some buildings
[3:44:14.440 --> 3:44:19.640]  too didn't they well they did not take over the parliament or anything but they did get into the
[3:44:19.640 --> 3:44:25.640]  national treasury uh but they didn't take it over uh they were just inside yes they were just inside
[3:44:25.640 --> 3:44:31.000]  uh and uh i guess the media spun it and called it a takeover just like for months they wouldn't
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:36.280]  even show your protest or they'd show the corner of a small group and say these five people are out
[3:44:36.280 --> 3:44:40.840]  here and then if they would have panned the camera which youtube showed tens of thousands
[3:44:40.840 --> 3:44:45.400]  that's how they minimize that we've had events here in austin with two three thousand people
[3:44:45.400 --> 3:44:50.520]  the news will come shoot the back of the crowd or a corner and only show five or six people
[3:44:50.520 --> 3:44:56.040]  yeah that's so typical and i've actually you know been following what's going on in the states
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:45:02.840]  and uh seeing the you know the news that are not really broadcasted in the main media and
[3:45:04.200 --> 3:45:09.480]  it's an entirely different situation i mean there are pretty grim things happening in the
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:15.160]  states right now and uh exactly they're trying to make the opposition right wing controlled by
[3:45:15.160 --> 3:45:20.040]  glenn back in the republicans so that they can get back into power and continue the fraud
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:25.640]  just like obama continued the fraud but the truth is the tea parties are really libertarian and grass
[3:45:25.640 --> 3:45:30.840]  roots yeah i've been actually following them because we're also working on this level that we
[3:45:30.840 --> 3:45:35.400]  think left and right is redundant and that's what we really need to focus on are the issues
[3:45:36.200 --> 3:45:43.880]  and our causes and uh our movement for example does not define itself as left or right uh our
[3:45:43.880 --> 3:45:49.480]  main objective is to bring more power to the people or the power that they rightfully own
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:53.640]  back to them so what's going to happen what's going to happen i mean i know you can't tell the
[3:45:53.640 --> 3:45:58.520]  future but right now the banks are starting to back off and saying okay you don't owe us as much
[3:45:58.520 --> 3:46:04.920]  money uh i mean they should go to jail much less not well i think it's not really in the hands of
[3:46:04.920 --> 3:46:09.960]  the bank uh banks anymore it is in the hands of the british and the dutch and the aslantic
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:15.240]  governments and that is the big problem it is being driven through the financial ministries of
[3:46:15.240 --> 3:46:21.640]  these countries instead of taking it as what it is it is a foreign affairs uh issue well why can't
[3:46:21.640 --> 3:46:27.880]  your parliament march in and take over the treasury there's nothing in the treasury it's no i know but
[3:46:27.880 --> 3:46:32.360]  i'm saying not let i mean you're saying the bureaucracy is still making the decisions but
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:39.880]  you're the boss you're the people's representative i mean well the thing is you know the the petition
[3:46:39.880 --> 3:46:44.440]  and the fact that we get to vote on it i i really hope that they will not take that away from us they
[3:46:44.440 --> 3:46:51.560]  can't take the voting from us by uh pulling back the bill um but i really think it is extremely
[3:46:51.560 --> 3:46:58.680]  important that we have this national referendum because it will set um uh an example for that the
[3:46:58.680 --> 3:47:04.760]  people can again call for national referendum if a certain percentage of the nation calls for it
[3:47:04.760 --> 3:47:14.120]  and that's coming up soon yes it's uh it's set for around 27th of february so we'll see what happens
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:20.840]  in the meantime i'm part of since i'm a acting chairman right now for the moment i get to go to
[3:47:20.840 --> 3:47:27.720]  all the heads of state meetings and so forth and um we're trying to form a sort of a joint
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:32.680]  approach to this which i think is very important that the politicians who are supposed to be
[3:47:32.680 --> 3:47:42.280]  representing the nation uh come out with a strong message that uh we you know are not going to take
[3:47:42.280 --> 3:47:49.000]  this as it is today because i feel it is more than anything a blackmail especially you know because
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:55.800]  the british in the dutch have also been saying that uh if we don't do what they say uh our application
[3:47:55.800 --> 3:48:01.080]  to the EU is not going to happen and why would you want to be part of the EU and go under all their
[3:48:01.080 --> 3:48:07.800]  taxes and control well i don't i don't want to do it especially because i'm in the uh committee
[3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:12.680]  that deals with the the application and i've seen what sort of thing the european union is
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:18.520]  oh tell us what the european union as a member of parliament seeing the application tell folks
[3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:22.600]  what it does i mean that's like saying give us all your power or we won't beat you in the head
[3:48:22.600 --> 3:48:26.360]  with a hammer don't you want to be beaten the head with a hammer we're going to take away you
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:31.320]  being beaten the head with a hammer if you don't do what we say you know i mean i mean it's ridiculous
[3:48:31.320 --> 3:48:35.880]  it's like if you don't do what we say we're not going to make you eat 20 pounds of rotten meat
[3:48:35.880 --> 3:48:45.400]  well it's a very strange organization which is probably the heaven of bureaucrats
[3:48:46.280 --> 3:48:53.880]  and the heaven of bureaucrats yes yes so but the social democrats who are the biggest party now
[3:48:53.880 --> 3:48:58.280]  they have been it's been their dream for a long time to join the european union so they put in
[3:48:58.280 --> 3:49:04.200]  the application and they had sold the nation that was another con they sold the nation that oh in order
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:11.240]  for us to see you know what the european union has to offer to us we have to apply but they did not
[3:49:11.240 --> 3:49:17.400]  tell us that they actually is an integrational process and in the meanwhile you know while we
[3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:23.800]  really suffering from this financial collapse we're spending so much money on this particular
[3:49:23.800 --> 3:49:28.920]  application where she could get all the information about the deal without applying
[3:49:28.920 --> 3:49:34.840]  me amazing absolutely i mean the the EU is completely undemocratic the bureaucrats will
[3:49:34.840 --> 3:49:39.800]  take you over if you started saying you agreed with them and and if you voted for it you suddenly
[3:49:39.800 --> 3:49:47.720]  have some 500 000 300 000 lavish job in brussels they're exempt from most the taxes they levy on
[3:49:47.720 --> 3:49:53.000]  the countries i mean you i mean that's the mark of corruption is when the government is exempt
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:50:00.760]  from the laws the people are under yeah i totally agree i don't think you know in any way if you
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:05.720]  know i wear for the EU this is not the right time to go and apply for membership because you know
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:12.680]  we're on our knees and that is not a good space to negotiate at all for a good deal but if the
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:18.440]  banks still take over and loot you guys the public's gonna rise up again certainly your
[3:50:18.440 --> 3:50:24.440]  populations learn the lesson that's standing up to the answer absolutely and and i really really
[3:50:24.440 --> 3:50:30.440]  hope that uh by you know if we can get support from people from around the world who are fed up
[3:50:30.440 --> 3:50:37.160]  with the same sort of um you know responsibilities they're given by the bankers but basically you
[3:50:37.160 --> 3:50:43.160]  know they're basically a race in the middle class that's what they're doing every time you get a house
[3:50:43.160 --> 3:50:47.880]  you own a house we have savings they suck it up when their bubbles burst so we need to do this
[3:50:47.880 --> 3:50:53.400]  together we do we're doing it together final segment coming up we may twist your arm do five more

[3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:28.520]  guests go ahead scott hi bergita back during the banking crisis when it hit the news here
[3:55:29.640 --> 3:55:36.440]  ron paul was interviewed and asked his opinion of what we should do and of course he said let the
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:45.160]  banks fail and then uh they they asked dr paul what does congress think we should do and dr paul
[3:55:45.160 --> 3:55:52.360]  said congress doesn't have a clue or do you have the same frustration in iceland that would you
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:58.680]  say it's the same level that dr paul has here of the ignorance just just plain old ignorance
[3:55:58.680 --> 3:56:08.200]  that exists in the body of lawmakers absolutely thank thank you for this question i think it
[3:56:09.160 --> 3:56:15.000]  has actually been quite shocking to see the level of ignorance and lack of being able to see the
[3:56:15.000 --> 3:56:21.160]  whole picture and i remember i went to parliament when the past the emergency law i was just a
[3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:27.320]  an ordinary citizen back then and i was looking at the members of parliament and they all looked
[3:56:27.320 --> 3:56:32.440]  like a five-year-old children feeling really embarrassed about the situation it did not make
[3:56:32.440 --> 3:56:37.400]  me feel very comfortable and then the expert bankers from the treasury prance in and use a
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:43.880]  bunch of fancy language and tell them what to do it's time to arrest these people absolutely one
[3:56:43.880 --> 3:56:49.000]  good thing about this entire economical collapse in iceland i don't know how it is in the states
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:55.320]  is that people have actually educated themselves a lot about what real economy yes it is waking people
[3:56:55.320 --> 3:57:02.760]  up that's been the good byproduct yes so i have a tendency to try to look into you know what can
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:09.320]  we learn from it and are there any positive elements in the situation and i think there is a lot of
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:15.080]  good positive elements in this for me it is a dream come true to see the aslantic wake up
[3:57:15.080 --> 3:57:21.320]  to realize that they can actually be the change makers in their own world yes real change not fake
[3:57:21.320 --> 3:57:26.440]  obama change thank you scott good question fred in ohio your question to the lawmaker from iceland

[3:59:10.760 --> 3:59:15.160]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[3:59:15.160 --> 3:59:20.440]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
