[00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.231]  I am wound up today!
[00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:38.077]  Everything is really coming into crystal clear focus, confirming all of our previous analysis and adding a lot of new developments to it.
[00:00:39.264 --> 00:00:51.250]  We've got Mark Dice of The Resistance joining us to talk about the zombie population and how they're selling people more and more to be narcissistic so they're compartmentalized and don't even care about themselves.
[00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:01.835]  When you really become totally narcissistic you just lose all connection to reality and you stop caring about other people and hence no one cares about you and the world becomes a living Hades.
[00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:07.650]  Okay, look at all these stacks of news in front of me, if you're a PrisonPlanet.TV viewer.
[00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.472]  If you're a radio listener, just go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com to look it all up.
[00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.234]  Look at this little story right here.
[00:01:16.234 --> 00:01:23.937]  This little story right here is out of Der Spiegel, the biggest publication in Deutschland.
[00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:28.059]  And it says, former Stasi cryptographers now develop technology for NATO.
[00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:40.786]  Remember seven, eight years ago when Homeland Security paid a million dollars plus a year for two years straight to Marcus Wolf, the former head of the Stasi, the model for 1984?
[00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:49.168]  To set that up in the U.S., to set up the rollout of the spy grid, the citizen spies, all of it?
[00:01:49.168 --> 00:01:53.351]  Well, here's some more news on that today.
[00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:59.495]  In Europe as well, this is a Stasi state that is being set up.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.041]  We're going to be talking about it.
[00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:06.303]  Also, I saw a report up on PrisonPlanet.com this morning at about 6 a.m.
[00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:06.923]  when I got up.
[00:02:06.923 --> 00:02:09.625]  Watson was posting stories.
[00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:14.847]  And it was counter-terror operations stops trucks on I-20, WSBTV.
[00:02:14.847 --> 00:02:19.170]  And buried in the article, they admit they were radiating the vehicles with x-ray systems.
[00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:37.782]  And of course you know about Forbes and others reporting, we told you about this years ago but now it's admitted, 500 in the latest purchase of mobile x-ray trucks that are at least, according to radiologists we've interviewed and engineers, 10 times stronger than a chest x-ray.
[00:02:38.442 --> 00:02:41.343]  And they are driving through every major neighborhood.
[00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:43.144]  This is just one purchase of 500.
[00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:56.250]  The intel we've got is there's thousands of these vehicles, x-ray trucks, thousands of big surveillance trucks that local police have hooked into the feds that have other electronic systems to pick up everything you're doing.
[00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.613]  I know the Austin Police Department has three of these stinking things just where I live in a town of less than a million people.
[00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:05.338]  It is total Stasi.
[00:03:05.338 --> 00:03:11.344]  It makes the greatest surveillance police state on earth look like child's play.
[00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:16.168]  It's just the Stasi had secret arrest, torture, and suppressed political dissent.
[00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:23.536]  But we have more surveillance than they do, and so now, right along with all of that, they're now bringing in the physical oppression as well.
[00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:35.943]  Telling you it's all being done because of men in caves in Afghanistan, but all the internal Homeland Security reports say it's for gun owners, landowners, returning veterans, people that love America, and the Bill of Rights.
[00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:52.612]  So, I asked Paul Watson this morning to do a detailed boil-down on the fact that all over the country, they're not just having warrantless checkpoints, but they have you and your family, and we have newscasts out of New York and other places, with the Army directing people through the x-ray machines that shoot right through your car.
[00:03:54.497 --> 00:04:00.106]  And this report doesn't just expose the fact that they're violating the Fourth Amendment.
[00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:02.369]  That's a small caveat to the fact that
[00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:09.105]  They're now selling the idea that being bathed in radiation is not bad for you.
[00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:24.495]  Now, you go back 20 years ago to 1990, the Army reports said DU, depleted uranium, was completely deadly, a last-ditch weapon if World War III started, and multiple divisions of armored tanks rolled in out of Eastern Europe into Western Europe.
[00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:29.078]  Ground troops would then be served out from the armory DU weapons.
[00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:32.759]  So they could shoot through tanks even with small arms.
[00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:40.660]  But they said this is during already a full-bore nuclear war, you only get these out because it's going to radiate and poison our own troops.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:50.062]  But if they're about to be killed by a Russian armored division, better than, you know, better they at least die five years later or ten years later from radiation and poisoning.
[00:04:50.062 --> 00:04:52.322]  Now they just say, hey, it's not bad.
[00:04:52.322 --> 00:04:53.342]  Mercury's not bad.
[00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:55.202]  Melamine's not bad.
[00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:56.943]  And we're going to radiate you and your family.
[00:04:56.943 --> 00:04:57.923]  We're going to murder you.
[00:04:59.707 --> 00:05:02.849]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.652]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:05:06.652 --> 00:05:09.534]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:14.438]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.

[00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:06.761]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:11.904]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:20.630]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.692]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:33.707]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:06:33.707 --> 00:06:38.789]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.930]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.711]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:45.592]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.841]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.824 --> 00:08:23.007]  You take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[00:08:23.007 --> 00:08:26.570]  You fire musket, but I'll run you through.
[00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.854]  And when we're waiting for the next attack, you better stand.
[00:08:30.854 --> 00:08:33.216]  There is no falling back.
[00:08:33.216 --> 00:08:35.879]  Because on this battlefield, no one wins.
[00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.862]  You take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:40.943]  You fire musket, but I'll run you through.
[00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:49.708]  I want the PrisonPlanet.TV viewers to see this.
[00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:55.053]  If they'll aim the document cam at this chessboard over here.
[00:08:55.053 --> 00:09:01.759]  At 1.30 in the middle of the third hour.
[00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:08.485]  I am going to basically give you a parallel, a parable, an analogy.
[00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:15.583]  of the New World Order system via the chessboard.
[00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:25.706]  So that is coming up in about two hours and 20 minutes from now.
[00:09:25.706 --> 00:09:29.027]  Because on this battlefield, no one wins.
[00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:36.390]  The globalists, when they're killing enemies with depleted uranium weapons, are also bathing our own troops
[00:09:37.515 --> 00:09:39.636]  In the soft kill weapon.
[00:09:39.636 --> 00:09:46.019]  It's hard kill when it's first used, but the derivative of it is a soft kill.
[00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:54.944]  And we're going to be discussing that coming up in this article by Paul Joseph Watson up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:54.944 --> 00:10:00.886]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[00:10:00.886 --> 00:10:05.769]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:13.582]  Boy, if there was ever going to be a Google search of the day, it's feds radiating Americans.
[00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:14.843]  People need to know about this.
[00:10:14.843 --> 00:10:15.723]  They need to fight it.
[00:10:15.723 --> 00:10:16.664]  They need to say no.
[00:10:16.664 --> 00:10:18.585]  They need to understand what's happening.
[00:10:18.585 --> 00:10:36.975]  The incredible precedent being set to roll out naked body scanners at county courthouses, federal courthouses, mobile vans, at least 500, driving by without warrants, that's another issue, bathing your house, and at least 10 times the radiation of a high-powered chest x-ray.
[00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:48.597]  They've now got super high-powered MRIs that even the New York Times admits is giving people brain damage and cancer and is so powerful it makes your hair fall out.
[00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:50.659]  Well, this stuff dwarfs that!
[00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:54.428]  And it's just open insanity!
[00:10:54.428 --> 00:11:09.623]  And Italy announces they're pulling out the naked body scanners because they don't work well, because people are rebelling, people aren't flying, the airlines here want them out, the public is saying no to them, it makes the lines longer, and they lie and say there's no radiation, and we now learn it's massive.
[00:11:11.127 --> 00:11:13.350]  And they lie and say they're not saving the images.
[00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:15.073]  And of course, they're lying.
[00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:16.815]  I told you that a year ago.
[00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:17.797]  Now it's admitted.
[00:11:17.797 --> 00:11:19.780]  They save it all by design.
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.487]  And yes, they now admit it gives them a biometric scan of your body for biometric scanning.
[00:11:25.779 --> 00:11:28.161]  Doesn't matter if Mel Gibson's running around L.A.
[00:11:28.161 --> 00:11:37.309]  in disguises, a fake nose and glasses, or if you're running around in a disguise, they've got millimeter wave cameras that have already gone up nationwide.
[00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:47.379]  I learned about this eight years ago, it's now Wired Magazine, that from 200 yards away, Wired reports, shoot through your clothes and scan your biometric signature.
[00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:51.022]  But how do they get your body scan attached to your name?
[00:11:51.022 --> 00:11:52.063]  You're going to the airport?
[00:11:52.503 --> 00:12:02.403]  They've got your name, you're next in the queue, you go through, they get the body scan and bathe you in radiation and set the precedent that they're going to do it.
[00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:22.127]  And set the precedent that DARPA and Homeland Security and their private operatives and mercenaries are going to fly around with helicopters and drive around with vans, not bathing your home in radiation, infrared radiation, which can just basically see heat sources like grow lamps.
[00:12:22.127 --> 00:12:30.073]  This is classic x-rays going through your house at at least 10 times a chest x-ray.
[00:12:31.263 --> 00:12:38.266]  And we've got the newscast, he's got it linked here, from Fox in New York, where they go, oh, the troops have helped arrest thousands for guns and drugs.
[00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:45.450]  We have people on the highway drive under this x-ray machine, and it shows people in their cars driving through it!
[00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:58.456]  Just five years ago, they had these at the border, and they get the people out, they put the truck up on a conveyor system, and they roll it through, and the guy's running it, getting an armored room, and run the machine.
[00:12:58.456 --> 00:12:59.817]  Now they just say, hey, troops!
[00:13:00.797 --> 00:13:02.098]  Hey, state police!
[00:13:02.098 --> 00:13:03.678]  Hey, Homeland Security people!
[00:13:03.678 --> 00:13:10.941]  You're gonna ride around in vans with x-ray blasters on the roof, shooting through people's houses.
[00:13:10.941 --> 00:13:14.762]  Do you know how much backscatter you're being bathed in?
[00:13:14.762 --> 00:13:26.027]  You know, going back when they first developed radar in the 1940s, that until the early 1950s, they would have people unshielded in radar systems until they found that most of them died within a decade of cancers?
[00:13:27.153 --> 00:13:31.255]  In fact, sometimes people would die within just a few months of being stationed at these facilities.
[00:13:31.255 --> 00:13:40.560]  They would joke around at the end of World War II and put their food on a table in front of the radar when they weren't looking for planes and heat their food.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.081]  They can do that with radio transmitters.
[00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:44.442]  Can heat the food!
[00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:51.085]  You know how many radio engineers I've worked with over the years that talk about how deadly an AM transmitter is up close?
[00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:53.826]  How deadly an FM transmitter is up close?
[00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:56.467]  Now, from every length of the antenna, it loses half its power.
[00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:58.989]  So, after a few hundred yards, there's almost nothing.
[00:13:58.989 --> 00:14:02.710]  But when you're right up next to that baby, you're in trouble.
[00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.151]  Do you understand?
[00:14:06.132 --> 00:14:16.877]  There is a strategic operation to tell the troops DU isn't bad, to use it all over the world, even have it in the smallest calibers of ammo, hundreds of different munitions.
[00:14:16.877 --> 00:14:18.217]  They know it's deadly.
[00:14:18.217 --> 00:14:26.040]  They're using it at target ranges and proving grounds all over the world, outside major cities and small towns.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.301]  But this isn't just about being radiated.
[00:14:28.301 --> 00:14:31.763]  It's about the mindset of the social engineers.
[00:14:32.643 --> 00:14:41.825]  To be so bold that they roll out with vaccines they know maim hundreds of thousands a year, kill tens of thousands on record, that they know have mercury in it.
[00:14:41.825 --> 00:14:52.468]  People complained a decade ago, the media runs a blitz saying there is no mercury in them, but people read the insert and said, here it is, the Marisol, and so they said, okay, mercury's good for you.
[00:14:52.468 --> 00:14:55.468]  Oh, China has thousands dying from melamine?
[00:14:55.468 --> 00:14:57.189]  We'll just tell you it's good for babies.
[00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:58.489]  We'll just tell you it's no problem.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.040]  Melamine's good.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.021]  Fluoride's good.
[00:15:02.021 --> 00:15:02.941]  Mercury's good.
[00:15:02.941 --> 00:15:05.062]  Radiation's good.
[00:15:05.062 --> 00:15:06.602]  No, it's not.
[00:15:06.602 --> 00:15:08.743]  No, it's not.
[00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:11.204]  And it just hit me again this morning at 6 a.m.
[00:15:11.204 --> 00:15:15.386]  when I got up and checked PrisonPlanet.com, and I already knew they were doing this.
[00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:18.027]  I remember a year ago, we had state reps on.
[00:15:18.027 --> 00:15:19.367]  The governor put a press release out.
[00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:20.868]  It's in Police State 4, the rise of FEMA.
[00:15:21.874 --> 00:15:32.403]  They had Army and Homeland Security checkpoints searching entire highways, and the governor said, you didn't tell me, get out of here, and they kept doing it.
[00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:35.865]  They said, you don't have any stinking jurisdiction over your state's slave.
[00:15:35.865 --> 00:15:37.106]  Shut up!
[00:15:37.106 --> 00:15:38.808]  Shut up!
[00:15:38.808 --> 00:15:41.330]  They have a shooting in Alabama, the Marine Corps shows up.
[00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.392]  They have a shooting in Austin, the Army shows up.
[00:15:44.392 --> 00:15:45.733]  We've got the video of it.
[00:15:45.733 --> 00:15:46.174]  Yesterday.
[00:15:50.307 --> 00:15:50.547]  I think?
[00:16:08.578 --> 00:16:13.825]  From admitting DU was bad and Mercury's bad and all this, to just saying, hey, it's not bad.
[00:16:13.825 --> 00:16:21.355]  Doesn't matter if their own manuals say it's totally deadly, both from the toxicity, the poison, the particula, and the radiation.
[00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:21.816]  Doesn't matter.
[00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:24.348]  They just say use it.
[00:16:24.348 --> 00:16:46.136]  I mean, just seven years ago, eight years ago, when they invaded Iraq, they went into the blast points all over the country where they blasted military installations and had our troops move into those installations and they would at least have dump trucks come in and dump some sand in the holes so that maybe some of it would get suppressed so all of it didn't get basically picked up and breathed.
[00:16:46.136 --> 00:16:48.177]  Now it's reported in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:54.062]  They just tell them, no problem men, no masks needed, no nothing, move right into this area.
[00:16:54.062 --> 00:17:00.528]  When they blow up a supposed Taliban nest, they don't tell them, don't go in there, we just use DU.
[00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:05.112]  They just say, get in there and get any intelligence you can.
[00:17:05.112 --> 00:17:09.436]  This is a level of wickedness and they just do it.
[00:17:09.436 --> 00:17:11.979]  And it's part of the population reduction agenda.
[00:17:15.137 --> 00:17:19.279]  And so we've got this report up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:26.964]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:29.985]  Oh man, this is horrible.
[00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:36.369]  While illegals and hardcore drugs flood into the country and across the border, authorities target truck drivers in Atlanta.
[00:17:37.352 --> 00:17:41.917]  Federal authorities do not concern themselves with the flood of illegal immigrants and drugs crossing the border every day.
[00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:45.761]  In fact, they've announced they've pulled the Border Patrol back and aren't even deporting illegals now.
[00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:53.230]  They're more worried about radiating American truck drivers at internal checkpoints with mobile scanners that shoot dangerous x-rays through both vehicles and passengers.
[00:17:54.949 --> 00:18:09.561]  As we reported last month, a federal government has acquired hundreds of backscatter x-ray scanners mounted in vans that they are now using in randomly scanned vehicles, passengers, homes, in complete violation of the Fourth Amendment, and with wanton disregard for the health and consequences.
[00:18:09.561 --> 00:18:11.883]  And they don't hide it now!
[00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:13.424]  I knew many years ago this was going on.
[00:18:13.424 --> 00:18:15.906]  Now, they've got it on the news!
[00:18:15.906 --> 00:18:18.588]  Forcing your family through it, driving by your neighborhood.
[00:18:18.588 --> 00:18:20.250]  Oh, look, we just looked through people's walls.
[00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.671]  It's land of the free, home of the brave.
[00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:30.858]  And it goes to the psychology of they're just openly training us to be poisoned and radiated and biologically killed.
[00:18:30.858 --> 00:18:38.185]  The Gardasil in the trials three and a half years ago killed large percentages of those that took it, maimed others, gave them autoimmune disorders.
[00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:44.692]  The new flu vaccine admittedly, massive increases in Guillain-Barré, narcolepsy, convulsions.
[00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:45.933]  They just, it's wonderful.
[00:18:45.933 --> 00:18:47.075]  It's wonderful.
[00:18:50.993 --> 00:19:10.244]  As an example of their expanding use was reported by WSB-TV yesterday after federal agents from several agencies including Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, and TSA set up an internal checkpoint on Interstate 20 just west of Atlanta and detained truck drivers for half an hour or more at a state-owned inspection station while they were scanned with a bomb detection device.
[00:19:10.244 --> 00:19:16.247]  Officials, they're not servants, they're officials, admitted there was no specific threat to justify the checkpoint.
[00:19:16.247 --> 00:19:19.689]  And they went on to say it was a drill, but then said it was also real.
[00:19:21.092 --> 00:19:26.795]  I've seen, we videotaped army checkpoints in 98 up in Temple.
[00:19:26.795 --> 00:19:32.158]  And then the year after that, we were in Temple and they were doing a fake drill and the troops walked right up and said, you don't videotape my face, boy.
[00:19:36.212 --> 00:19:46.001]  I'm going to continue with this on the other side, but I mean, look, if they can train you to step into a radiation bathing system that records your naked body, why not up the ante and start frying you with chest x-rays?
[00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:47.242]  I'd said that was next for the airports.
[00:19:47.242 --> 00:19:52.586]  They're now talking about chest x-rays at airports to stop breast bombers.
[00:19:52.586 --> 00:19:55.249]  And why stop a chest x-ray?
[00:19:55.249 --> 00:19:58.371]  Something at least 10 times more powerful will fry you and your family.
[00:20:02.349 --> 00:20:08.112]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:20.198]  I started SurvivalistSeeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating banner ad on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:28.462]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk seed seller to the public.
[00:20:28.462 --> 00:20:32.144]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:49.185]  Now I'm offering 50 all organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy food.
[00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:51.906]  Don't wait until it's too late.
[00:20:51.906 --> 00:20:57.347]  I'm Vic John Lipscomb and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:05.566]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.291]  Today.
[00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:00.811]  Good day.
[00:22:00.811 --> 00:22:02.472]  Jim Newcomer for Midas Resources.
[00:22:02.472 --> 00:22:02.953]  September 29th, 2010.
[00:22:02.953 --> 00:22:03.973]  Gold opened this morning at $1,310.
[00:22:03.973 --> 00:22:07.215]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1,344.36, $6.72.18 for a half-ounce, or $3.3609 for a quarter-ounce.
[00:22:07.215 --> 00:22:07.815]  That's $1,344.36, $6.72.18, or $3.3609.
[00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:23.850]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm, warning of Greek-style U.S.
[00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.991]  debt crises.
[00:22:24.991 --> 00:22:27.172]  CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S.
[00:22:27.172 --> 00:22:29.593]  economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:34.934]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[00:22:34.934 --> 00:22:41.697]  Hi, Ted Anderson, the Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[00:22:41.897 --> 00:22:48.064]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population, and rising interest rates spells economic disaster.
[00:22:48.064 --> 00:22:48.725]  Call today at 800-686-2237.

[00:22:50.166 --> 00:22:51.228]  Ask for the CBO document.
[00:22:51.228 --> 00:22:51.448]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.638 --> 00:23:02.699]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[00:23:02.699 --> 00:23:05.080]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:13.004]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.

[00:23:50.229 --> 00:23:51.210]  Or call 1-800-875-4254.
[00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:51.691]  That's 1-800-875-4254 today!
[00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:27.447]  If there was ever any doubt in your mind about just how psychopathic and out of control the globalists are, look at how they've hired the Stasi to set up Homeland Security, the former heads of Stasi.
[00:24:27.447 --> 00:24:34.013]  That's in Der Spiegel today, over in the EU, but the same here in the US.
[00:24:34.013 --> 00:24:38.997]  And they're now driving around for many years, but now publicly telling you they look through your walls,
[00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:49.930]  I mean, you can't take a death row prisoner and give them cruel and unusual punishment and radiate them.
[00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.952]  But the system just doesn't care.
[00:24:51.952 --> 00:24:57.977]  They're all over the news today saying, yeah, they're gonna start shutting down freedom on the web.
[00:24:57.977 --> 00:24:59.178]  In fact, I've got a report
[00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:04.681]  Here out of the French News Agency, and it's only printed one page, but you guys print me the whole thing.
[00:25:04.681 --> 00:25:12.664]  Internet's creator slams blight of web disconnection laws and basically says the Internet as we know it is being killed.
[00:25:12.664 --> 00:25:19.206]  The Internet's creator is telling you they're killing the Internet, slowly, as we speak.
[00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:21.147]  Okay?
[00:25:21.147 --> 00:25:23.388]  The time for denial is over.
[00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.949]  They know we're onto them.
[00:25:24.949 --> 00:25:26.229]  They know we're exposing them.
[00:25:26.229 --> 00:25:28.690]  They've used the web to get everybody connected and tracked.
[00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.391]  Now they're gonna move to the controlled web.
[00:25:31.553 --> 00:25:32.854]  Unless we stop them.
[00:25:32.854 --> 00:25:34.035]  It's happening now.
[00:25:34.035 --> 00:25:40.499]  And as the neocons are blaming Obama for this, Obama is a sniveling teleprompter reading puppet, just like they are.
[00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:45.182]  This stuff isn't run by Bush or Obama or Sarah Palin or the Easter Bunny.
[00:25:45.182 --> 00:25:51.246]  It's run by the Rand Corporation, by the Ford Foundation, by the Carnegie Endowment, by the Pentagon.
[00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:56.310]  Our criminal government created the UN.
[00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.192]  You know, there's a microcosm of Glenn Beck.
[00:26:01.324 --> 00:26:10.010]  Or really a prototypical example would be McCarthy.
[00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:18.276]  And you go back to so-called McCarthyism, he was very useful, and he meant well, when he was just saying it's low-level communists that have infiltrated us.
[00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:26.702]  But when he found out the army was funding the Soviet Union, when he found out that our government and the Ford Foundation and Carnegie and others, this is what he talked about.
[00:26:27.426 --> 00:26:32.449]  Was setting this up to create the enemy and then transfer us into a global government.
[00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:34.030]  This is all declassified now.
[00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.332]  They came out and politically destroyed him.
[00:26:37.332 --> 00:26:38.713]  And what does Glenn Beck do?
[00:26:38.713 --> 00:26:40.014]  I've really been analyzing this.
[00:26:40.014 --> 00:26:41.515]  He's like a modern McCarthy.
[00:26:41.515 --> 00:26:46.358]  He exposes the corrupt unions and Cass Sunstein and tells you they're the top people.
[00:26:47.233 --> 00:26:50.435]  The New World Order came out of the United States and England.
[00:26:50.435 --> 00:26:51.636]  Eugenics did.
[00:26:51.636 --> 00:27:03.544]  Not from the American people, the British people, but from the robber barons, from the British Empire, that couldn't hold on to its empire through naked force and came up with scientific systems to control people.
[00:27:03.544 --> 00:27:05.845]  This is their words!
[00:27:05.845 --> 00:27:16.392]  I had a New York Times best-selling author, Emmy-nominated researcher who got into the Rand Corporation documents, they let him in, and it's all world government, all total tyranny.
[00:27:18.444 --> 00:27:20.365]  And how the elite are going to have immortality.
[00:27:20.365 --> 00:27:21.266]  That's their goal.
[00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:27.129]  Whether it's real or not, they want a global police state to put it in place so we're straightjacketed down.
[00:27:27.129 --> 00:27:33.193]  When they kill our hind ends with soft kill weapons, everybody starts wondering why half the people have cancer.
[00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:35.495]  They just will play that out.
[00:27:35.495 --> 00:27:39.297]  They're testing doing this slowly, seeing what they can get away with.
[00:27:39.297 --> 00:27:41.418]  Incrementalism.
[00:27:41.418 --> 00:27:46.802]  And now, they're openly rolling around with these vans, violating your rights and radiating you.
[00:27:49.881 --> 00:27:55.405]  American science and engineering company based in Massachusetts has sold many of the devices to U.S.
[00:27:55.405 --> 00:28:00.908]  law enforcement agencies who are already using them on the streets for security purposes.
[00:28:00.908 --> 00:28:09.434]  Without a warrant, the government doesn't have a right to peer beneath your clothes without probable cause, points out Mark Rottenberg, executive director of Epic.
[00:28:10.114 --> 00:28:13.856]  Even airport scans are typically used only as secondary security measure.
[00:28:13.856 --> 00:28:24.281]  If the scans can only be in exceptional cases in airports, and that's even wrong, the idea that they can be used routinely on city streets is very hard argument to make.
[00:28:24.281 --> 00:28:28.103]  Well, I mean, even the people criticizing this are doing it mildly.
[00:28:28.103 --> 00:28:29.364]  This is far worse than that.
[00:28:30.285 --> 00:28:42.142]  We have warned from the very beginning everything you see being rolled out in the airports is eventually designed to hit the streets of America because prisoners in their own communities constantly harassed, scanned and surveilled by the oppressive state.
[00:28:42.142 --> 00:28:45.107]  And I didn't just imagine this and then I'm right.
[00:28:45.647 --> 00:28:54.269]  I saw Governor Ridge, before Homeland Security even got funding and became a cabinet position, say they were going to have naked body scanners on the streets.
[00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:59.590]  They were going to have TSA Viper teams on the highways, and in the bus stops, and in the trains.
[00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.691]  And what does the report say about Atlanta?
[00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:03.631]  Viper teams!
[00:29:03.631 --> 00:29:05.111]  TSA!
[00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:08.412]  On I-20!
[00:29:08.412 --> 00:29:10.833]  They're gonna have naked body scanners in the mall!
[00:29:10.833 --> 00:29:11.893]  To get in a building!
[00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:21.760]  Folks, I am so angry that it's freezing cold.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.462]  It's 68 degrees in this office and I'm sweating.
[00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:28.585]  Because at a primitive level, I am threatened by this new world order.
[00:29:28.585 --> 00:29:36.131]  At a primitive level, I understand this control grid being set up and I have all their own admissions of it.
[00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:36.992]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:39.594]  I'm gonna finish up on this article and then get into all the other news.
[00:29:39.594 --> 00:29:45.178]  It's just... It's a nightmare!
[00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:50.615]  And they're telling these cops and people running these scanners that it's not bad for them.
[00:29:50.615 --> 00:29:52.016]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.016 --> 00:29:54.537]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.537 --> 00:30:00.118]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.118 --> 00:30:01.759]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:30:24.091 --> 00:30:30.618]  Since 1947, Calvin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.670]  Thank you!
[00:30:59.653 --> 00:31:04.196]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:05.117]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.117 --> 00:31:08.540]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.400]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.284]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.284 --> 00:31:15.024]  It's true.
[00:31:15.024 --> 00:31:19.908]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:19.908 --> 00:31:20.729]  Number 3.
[00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:24.311]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:28.014]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.214 --> 00:31:29.014]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.014 --> 00:31:31.775]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:31.775 --> 00:31:35.456]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:36.237]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.237 --> 00:31:40.398]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.621]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.621 --> 00:31:51.401]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:56.003]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:31:56.323 --> 00:31:59.304]  877-327-0365.
[00:31:59.304 --> 00:32:02.445]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[00:32:02.445 --> 00:32:06.226]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[00:32:06.226 --> 00:32:09.107]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[00:32:09.107 --> 00:32:14.029]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:14.489 --> 00:32:20.431]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:26.094]  It's all fresh, made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[00:32:26.094 --> 00:32:30.636]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[00:32:30.636 --> 00:32:39.119]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:40.920]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.702]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:32:43.702 --> 00:32:51.547]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.547 --> 00:33:02.535]  Again, on the web, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[00:33:02.535 --> 00:33:10.200]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.264 --> 00:33:22.810]  What's happening is, psychologically, we're being conditioned, we're being sold to accept anything.
[00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:26.112]  Oh, the government hired the SCSI to train them how to spy on you.
[00:33:26.112 --> 00:33:30.035]  Oh, they're training your kids in public school to spy on you.
[00:33:30.035 --> 00:33:35.758]  Oh, they're training the Explorer Scouts to take on veterans that won't turn in their guns.
[00:33:35.758 --> 00:33:38.700]  New York Times, isn't that great?
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.723]  Oh, we're driving around radiating your house without a warrant.
[00:33:42.723 --> 00:33:43.824]  And they just do it.
[00:33:44.926 --> 00:33:50.310]  Look, these people are in control of the major courts, they're in control of most of the states, the federal government.
[00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:57.956]  They're in so much control, Congress can't even find where $28 trillion went.
[00:33:57.956 --> 00:34:02.500]  And the system is just literally going for broke here.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:07.043]  It's going completely insane.
[00:34:07.043 --> 00:34:08.645]  It's doing whatever it wants.
[00:34:12.305 --> 00:34:15.988]  And it's only going to get more crazy from here.
[00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:25.514]  They're just trying to normalize all of this bizarre scientific sci-fi tyranny and dehumanization as if it's normal.
[00:34:25.514 --> 00:34:30.258]  Notice they're all over the news every day now saying, should vaccines be mandatory?
[00:34:30.258 --> 00:34:36.662]  They've already tried through color law to say to have a job at a hospital or to be at a college or to be in a public school.
[00:34:36.662 --> 00:34:38.223]  You've got to have all these vaccines.
[00:34:38.223 --> 00:34:38.804]  It's a lie.
[00:34:40.677 --> 00:34:45.239]  So now that people have woken up that it's a lie, they're like, well, maybe we will make you.
[00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:45.919]  Trust us.
[00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:49.080]  You know, we're always promoting world population reduction.
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.143]  We've been caught in tens of thousands of chemical, biological, and radiological tests, in many cases that killed U.S.
[00:34:55.143 --> 00:34:58.024]  citizens and others.
[00:34:58.024 --> 00:35:03.966]  Oh, we just, you know, tested nerve gas over and over again, and biologicals on our own troops, but it's not their troops.
[00:35:03.966 --> 00:35:05.126]  They hate the troops.
[00:35:05.126 --> 00:35:06.187]  They use the troops.
[00:35:08.188 --> 00:35:10.249]  How they tell the troops DU's not bad.
[00:35:10.249 --> 00:35:13.489]  So think about this.
[00:35:13.489 --> 00:35:15.830]  Do listeners want to make this the number one search term?
[00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:22.812]  I mean, I think this is one of the most important ones we've had, but I don't want to continue doing this if it's not gonna be the number one search.
[00:35:22.812 --> 00:35:30.793]  There's only been a few cases out of 26 times that it hadn't hit number one, and I do want it to be number one so people then link through to this story.
[00:35:30.793 --> 00:35:32.934]  They're like, what's heads radiating Americans?
[00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:38.314]  Three words, Feds Radiating Americans.
[00:35:38.314 --> 00:35:39.935]  What is that?
[00:35:39.935 --> 00:35:41.336]  What is that?
[00:35:41.336 --> 00:35:51.741]  Well, they'll click on it and they'll find the article from PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, Feds Radiating Americans at Internal Checkpoints.
[00:35:51.741 --> 00:35:53.982]  Nationwide, you're going to be directed through these.
[00:35:53.982 --> 00:35:57.364]  You're going to be put through these at the airports.
[00:35:57.364 --> 00:36:02.066]  And they're increasing many times more powerful than chest x-rays.
[00:36:05.236 --> 00:36:07.578]  And do they tell the workers, get behind lead shielding?
[00:36:07.578 --> 00:36:08.659]  No!
[00:36:08.659 --> 00:36:12.202]  That's what's so wild about this.
[00:36:12.202 --> 00:36:15.624]  They're training us to just die.
[00:36:15.624 --> 00:36:23.210]  They're training us to just come up with the cancers and all the illnesses and the media just, we don't know why it's increasing.
[00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.411]  That's what they think of you.
[00:36:24.411 --> 00:36:26.373]  They think you're that stupid.
[00:36:29.881 --> 00:36:39.445]  In fact, I wasn't gonna open the phones up this hour, but I wanna open the phones up for Homeland Security, police, military, Border Patrol, people that run these machines.
[00:36:39.445 --> 00:36:50.089]  Because I know before they would just put a truck or a car on a big mobile system and it had rollers on it and would roll it across and everybody got an armored shelter.
[00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:56.412]  Now, we've had radiologists on about this, they have high-powered radiation machines that are at least 10 times more powerful
[00:36:57.355 --> 00:37:03.776]  The chest x-rays rolling around, blasting through people's houses, and frying the people inside the vehicles.
[00:37:03.776 --> 00:37:05.137]  I mean, that's a big deal.
[00:37:05.137 --> 00:37:08.697]  Not to mention the Fourth Amendment of them looking through your walls.
[00:37:08.697 --> 00:37:10.158]  Oh, that East Germany, they were bad.
[00:37:10.158 --> 00:37:15.239]  They spied on people.
[00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:20.760]  And, again, here is Der Spiegel today.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.481]  Former Stasi cryptographers now develop technology for NATO.
[00:37:26.448 --> 00:37:35.956]  And it goes on to talk about all these different secret operations, how they've been hired to work with the EU to setting up these grids.
[00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:40.440]  And it's the same story seven, eight years ago, right when Homeland Security got set up.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:47.126]  For two years, they had multi-million dollar contracts for people like Marcus Wolf, the former head of the SCSI.
[00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:53.732]  And when I saw that, I didn't believe it, and I went and looked up the federal funding orders, and sure enough, it was there.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:01.485]  You can't make that type of stuff up.
[00:38:01.485 --> 00:38:13.754]  As we've warned from the very beginning, everything you see being rolled out in the airports is eventually designed to hit the streets as America becomes prisoners in their own communities, constantly harassed, scanned and surveilled by an oppressive state.
[00:38:13.754 --> 00:38:20.319]  Mobile scanners for crowds that would be used at football matches and other public events have already been announced, where they just blast everyone.
[00:38:20.979 --> 00:38:25.945]  Yeah, I saw CBS News in 2001 saying they were already testing them in several major US airports.
[00:38:25.945 --> 00:38:26.466]  Passive scanners!
[00:38:41.516 --> 00:38:53.202]  Body and vehicle scanners are just one tool authorities, not servants, authorities, plan to implement on a widespread basis as part of our deepening decline at a high-tech militarized police state.
[00:38:53.202 --> 00:39:06.489]  Homeland Security is already implementing technology to be enforced at security events, which purportedly reads, on behalf of an individual who passes through a checkpoint.
[00:39:07.679 --> 00:39:08.579]  Malintent.
[00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:10.400]  It shows if you may look angry.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.281]  Facial trackers.
[00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:23.426]  The video below explains how the future attributed screening technology or fast checkpoints will conduct psychological and behavioral tests in order to weed out suspected terrorists and criminals.
[00:39:23.426 --> 00:39:29.309]  And two years ago, Homeland Security actually heard proposals and was favorable to make everyone wear a high-powered taser bracelet.
[00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:30.290]  Everyone!
[00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.490]  When you get on board the aircraft.
[00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.692]  And now, major European aircraft companies
[00:39:35.632 --> 00:39:45.640]  Are saying that they'll be fitted with cameras in the back seat that listens and records and everything goes through an AI computer that records everything you're saying and looks for anything threatening.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.564]  All of you being watched by cameras as you fly with taser bracelets.
[00:39:50.564 --> 00:40:00.052]  But let me tell you, that's not even as out of control nightmare as mobile vans violating your Fourth Amendment, driving around blasting your house with radiation.
[00:40:00.052 --> 00:40:02.614]  I mean, I can't believe this!
[00:40:02.614 --> 00:40:03.915]  And this is only the beginning!
[00:40:04.813 --> 00:40:09.277]  Remember Bill Clinton's executive order for the biometric thumb scans that he signed in 1994?
[00:40:09.277 --> 00:40:13.320]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:18.020]  And I go in and get arrested protesting it.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:19.220]  And I hand out the executive order.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.301]  People said, what's Alex making up?
[00:40:21.301 --> 00:40:24.622]  They're not taking blood and DNA to get a driver's license.
[00:40:24.622 --> 00:40:26.382]  They put it on the books.
[00:40:26.382 --> 00:40:27.442]  They haven't implemented it.
[00:40:27.442 --> 00:40:34.345]  And now I've seen mainstream news articles saying, should we take blood and DNA and test for drugs when you get a driver's license?
[00:40:34.345 --> 00:40:35.565]  Should we put clinics in?
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:49.364]  Oh, that's a free society, where you go in and have your blood taken, or you have a cheek swab taken of your DNA to get a driver's license, or they say they could take your hair and test for drugs.
[00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:52.805]  Did you ever use drugs?
[00:40:52.805 --> 00:40:56.206]  Remember, for 39 years, anyone born in the U.S.
[00:40:56.206 --> 00:41:01.048]  or England or Australia and a whole bunch of other Western countries, continuity of agenda
[00:41:02.774 --> 00:41:09.502]  A global system 39 years ago set up to take your baby's blood at birth, and they give the parents a nice little cover story.
[00:41:09.502 --> 00:41:13.647]  Oh, we're doing this to check for blood diseases.
[00:41:13.647 --> 00:41:16.390]  And of course, then you ask them, well, why don't the hospital just do that?
[00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.012]  Why does it go to the health department?
[00:41:18.012 --> 00:41:19.034]  It's a state mandate.
[00:41:20.267 --> 00:41:24.210]  And I looked right at him and I said, I happen to actually know about this.
[00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:28.033]  Here's the secret documents, not even declassified at the time that I'd been leaked.
[00:41:28.033 --> 00:41:29.714]  Now they're declassified.
[00:41:29.714 --> 00:41:31.895]  This goes into a DNA database.
[00:41:31.895 --> 00:41:35.918]  And then there's this like, well, we know that too.
[00:41:35.918 --> 00:41:39.961]  As if because they've been let in on the little secret, it's, it's okay.
[00:41:39.961 --> 00:41:42.503]  All part of a culture of lies.
[00:41:42.503 --> 00:41:47.747]  Oh, hon, we're just taking the blood to test your baby for diseases.
[00:41:52.284 --> 00:41:59.246]  And a year ago when they declassified all that, everybody was calling me going, it's exactly as you said, it's a Pentagon database run by the UN, how did you know it?
[00:41:59.246 --> 00:42:05.208]  Because I was sent the information 14 years ago by a nurse in San Antonio!
[00:42:05.208 --> 00:42:09.869]  And then I learned that members of the Australian Parliament knew about it and were criticizing it.
[00:42:09.869 --> 00:42:14.751]  And I had a member of the US House of Representatives on from Virginia who was criticizing it in the last decade.
[00:42:17.554 --> 00:42:18.955]  And you know why it's a big debate in Australia?
[00:42:18.955 --> 00:42:20.696]  They're a few years ahead of us in some respects.
[00:42:20.696 --> 00:42:32.064]  It was about five, six years ago they started announcing in Australia, should Australia use its secret DNA database of all those born in crime investigations?
[00:42:32.064 --> 00:42:35.187]  Oh, we just so happen to have this DNA database we didn't tell you about.
[00:42:35.187 --> 00:42:36.868]  And Australians went, huh?
[00:42:36.868 --> 00:42:38.209]  You have my blood, where'd you get it?
[00:42:38.209 --> 00:42:40.090]  When you were a baby.
[00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:45.214]  I mean, think about how sickening this is.
[00:42:45.214 --> 00:42:46.355]  Oh, let me continue though.
[00:42:47.322 --> 00:42:55.729]  I mean, if I pulled up in front of your house with a high-powered x-ray gun and looked through your walls, you'd come out and punch me in the nose, you pervert peeping Tom.
[00:42:56.854 --> 00:43:06.461]  But Americans are so scared of people in black vans and suits, all acting tough, that, I better not even say anything, there's a van outside X-raying me.
[00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:07.802]  I better lick their boots.
[00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:10.264]  Thank you for assaulting me with radiation.
[00:43:10.264 --> 00:43:11.285]  Thank you, government.
[00:43:11.285 --> 00:43:12.166]  Thank you.
[00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:14.127]  Thank you, private contractors.
[00:43:14.127 --> 00:43:22.573]  And the idiots, because they're given a little security clearance, and a little technician's outfit, or a black suit, and their sunglasses, and they all act, and the movies all build them up, it's real tough.
[00:43:22.573 --> 00:43:25.636]  They're just in there with a backscatter radiating them, and they like it too.
[00:43:25.956 --> 00:43:33.066]  Because they're on a power trip, and they've made the decision that the radiation's not bad for them, just like they've told the troops.
[00:43:33.066 --> 00:43:35.349]  Oh, DU's not bad anymore.
[00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:37.311]  It's got a 4 billion year half-life.
[00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:39.074]  Pull up the half-life of depleted uranium.
[00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:40.275]  I think it's 4 bil.
[00:43:40.275 --> 00:43:41.657]  Let's make sure I'm right.
[00:43:41.657 --> 00:43:43.300]  But it's no problem.
[00:43:46.843 --> 00:43:55.288]  So mobile scanners at football games, CCTV cameras that scan you on the street, body and vehicle scanners are just one tool authorities plan to implement.
[00:43:55.288 --> 00:43:59.131]  Homeland Security is already implementing technology to be enforced at security events.
[00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:10.838]  This clip shows individuals who attend security events being led into trailers before they are interrogated as to whether they are terrorists, this is con search, you name it, while lie detector style computer programs analyze their psychological responses.
[00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:18.228]  The subjects are asked about their whereabouts and if they are attempting to smuggle bombs or recording devices into the expo.
[00:44:18.228 --> 00:44:26.120]  So the message is, if you're smuggling in a cell phone to videotape the concert, that's the same as bombs.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.502]  See, the message is, you're a terrorist.
[00:44:30.515 --> 00:44:33.660]  And you just gotta not go to football games and go to places that have these.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.265]  That's why the airports are already wanting to pull them, because air travel's down so much.
[00:44:37.265 --> 00:44:39.008]  But the globalists don't care, that own the airlines.
[00:44:39.008 --> 00:44:40.631]  You know, they print the money.
[00:44:40.631 --> 00:44:42.814]  But some of the executives and people don't like it.
[00:44:42.814 --> 00:44:45.218]  That's why Italy said they want to pull them out, and are pulling them out.
[00:44:48.922 --> 00:44:57.428]  The subjects are asked about their whereabouts and if they are attempting to smuggle bombs or recording devices to the expo, proving that the technology is intended to be used at public events and not just airports.
[00:44:57.428 --> 00:45:03.352]  Individuals who do not satisfy the first lie detector test are then asked additional questions and everyone's run through them.
[00:45:04.977 --> 00:45:13.584]  And then, of course, this is the new economy, so the only jobs, a lot of the guys going to the concert are actually going to be, you know, I run one of these scanners down at the mall, Bill, how you doing?
[00:45:13.584 --> 00:45:16.587]  Oh, put me in the radiation bather, I love it.
[00:45:16.587 --> 00:45:20.090]  I just got diagnosed with testicular cancer at 31 yesterday.
[00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:24.214]  I don't know why, but I like the power, I like it, like it.
[00:45:27.466 --> 00:45:36.832]  The implementation of Checkpoint USA where citizens are routinely stopped, searched, and radiated by federal viper teams is further evidence of how America is crumbling into a Soviet style.
[00:45:36.832 --> 00:45:38.353]  The Soviets weren't this bad.
[00:45:38.353 --> 00:45:44.057]  Police state where the presumption of innocence until proven guilty is abolished and the Fourth Amendment eviscerated.
[00:45:44.057 --> 00:45:49.140]  I thought the Rand Corporation and the Pentagon built this police state up to protect me from the Ruskies.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.721]  Oh, I'm sorry, they funded them from the start.
[00:45:52.927 --> 00:46:00.033]  Privacy organizations and civil rights lawyers need to actively and immediately bring lawsuits against the federal government for unleashing this tyranny upon the American people.
[00:46:00.033 --> 00:46:01.534]  It's also in Europe, I would add.
[00:46:01.534 --> 00:46:15.707]  As part of a bid to create a chilling atmosphere that ends all dissent and makes the people fear their own government as they are made to prove that they are not criminals or terrorists on a day-to-day basis while a high-tech slave pen is constructed around their entire existence.
[00:46:23.143 --> 00:46:25.745]  So, let's make this the number one search term.
[00:46:25.745 --> 00:46:27.327]  Feds radiating Americans.
[00:46:27.327 --> 00:46:28.988]  I think this is a pretty important issue.
[00:46:28.988 --> 00:46:30.850]  Three words, we'll put it on screen.
[00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:34.893]  Feds radiating Americans.
[00:46:34.893 --> 00:46:42.040]  F-E-D-S is the first word, radiating, R-A-D-I-A-T-I-N-G, Americans.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.262]  Feds radiating Americans.
[00:46:45.262 --> 00:46:47.324]  Three words!
[00:46:47.324 --> 00:46:48.906]  And the good news is here,
[00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:55.012]  That many countries are announcing that they've done the trials, they're removing them.
[00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:59.834]  Italy to abandon airport body scanner project, AP.
[00:46:59.834 --> 00:47:13.418]  But meanwhile, Napolitano strikes back one day later, pitches plan for airport security in 190 nations, where the US government's even offering money to get them to accept the scanners.
[00:47:13.418 --> 00:47:16.119]  There's another report here, body scanner backlash grows.
[00:47:17.987 --> 00:47:24.875]  And now in places like El Paso, they're trying to force everyone into the scanners.
[00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:27.398]  It's incremental conditioning.
[00:47:27.398 --> 00:47:30.661]  Here's Janet Napolitano urges next stage of airport screening.
[00:47:30.661 --> 00:47:35.607]  The questions, the interrogations, the brain scanners, the face scanners.
[00:47:35.607 --> 00:47:36.828]  That's in CBS News.
[00:47:37.976 --> 00:47:38.536]  All announced.
[00:47:38.536 --> 00:47:40.717]  Here it is from Homeland Security itself.
[00:47:40.717 --> 00:47:42.337]  Secure Flight Program.
[00:47:42.337 --> 00:47:44.698]  They're announcing the new dog training.
[00:47:44.698 --> 00:47:45.839]  The next phase.
[00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:56.402]  The next row of bigger, sharper Homeland Security shark teeth biting into you and your family.
[00:47:56.402 --> 00:47:59.323]  And who's been advising them?
[00:47:59.323 --> 00:48:01.143]  Who's been advising?
[00:48:01.143 --> 00:48:05.485]  The Stasi have been advising the United States and Europe on how to do this.
[00:48:10.509 --> 00:48:11.930]  What does the RAND Corporation say?
[00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.772]  What does the National Intelligence Council say?
[00:48:14.772 --> 00:48:23.780]  They say it's the US government's policy to merge us into a world government where by 2025 we are all biologically managed by the state.
[00:48:24.605 --> 00:48:24.905]  To be
[00:48:44.872 --> 00:48:45.652]  They still don't care.
[00:48:45.652 --> 00:48:46.213]  They love it.
[00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:47.213]  They love dying.
[00:48:47.213 --> 00:48:48.975]  The cops love all the vaccines.
[00:48:48.975 --> 00:48:50.195]  They love shooting their kids up.
[00:48:50.195 --> 00:48:52.497]  They love the radiation blasters.
[00:48:52.497 --> 00:48:54.718]  They just love it.
[00:48:54.718 --> 00:48:55.679]  They love it.
[00:48:55.679 --> 00:48:56.639]  They love losing.
[00:48:56.639 --> 00:48:57.740]  They love failing.
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.401]  They love losing their humanity.
[00:48:59.401 --> 00:49:08.787]  They enjoy it because they have little fantasy shows with Jack Bauer and other TV programs where they torture people and spy and the government's good.
[00:49:08.787 --> 00:49:09.708]  That's television!
[00:49:10.626 --> 00:49:19.738]  You know, we put a video out, is Glenn Beck for real, where I say, well, he's moving in a better direction, admitting the world government wants to reduce our population.
[00:49:19.738 --> 00:49:22.823]  But he tells you it's low-level communists that are doing it.
[00:49:22.823 --> 00:49:27.369]  Communism is only one fake revolution of the megabanks.
[00:49:29.131 --> 00:49:30.552]  Beck's always quoting Carol Quigley.
[00:49:30.552 --> 00:49:45.189]  If he read his 1,100 page book, or read his other 500 page book, the Anglo-American Establishment, or 400, or whatever it is, he'd know that this guy was given access to the Rand Corporation and to all these other institutions, and he said, we're setting up a world government.
[00:49:45.189 --> 00:49:46.991]  We control the communists and the fascists.
[00:49:47.532 --> 00:49:52.594]  We fund it all, and we want authoritarian rule, and authoritarian rule is good!
[00:49:52.594 --> 00:49:54.575]  The Pentagon runs the Communists!
[00:49:54.575 --> 00:49:56.896]  The Pentagon runs the Muslim extremists!
[00:49:56.896 --> 00:49:58.936]  The Pentagon runs the Black Panthers!
[00:49:58.936 --> 00:50:02.358]  The Pentagon runs Mecha and La Raza!
[00:50:02.358 --> 00:50:05.579]  The Pentagon is a giant Death Star to take down freedom!
[00:50:08.373 --> 00:50:15.877]  The Pentagon hates the troops and tells them DU is not bad for them and uses them as guinea pigs with experimental vaccines.
[00:50:15.877 --> 00:50:18.038]  You know Iraq 1, Iraq 2, and Iraq...
[00:50:20.299 --> 00:50:20.740]  I don't
[00:50:40.299 --> 00:50:44.643]  My wife's gonna have a deformed baby, and I'm just gonna salute George W. Bush.
[00:50:44.643 --> 00:50:46.525]  Oh, thank you for the DU, sir!
[00:50:46.525 --> 00:50:47.446]  Thank you!
[00:50:47.446 --> 00:50:47.966]  Thank you!
[00:50:47.966 --> 00:50:49.808]  I mean, I mean, this is hell!
[00:50:49.808 --> 00:50:51.109]  This is hell!
[00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:52.770]  This is hell being released on us!
[00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:53.751]  Do you understand that?
[00:50:53.751 --> 00:50:57.154]  Do you understand our country was taken over a long time ago?
[00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:58.596]  The communists are run by the government!
[00:51:00.643 --> 00:51:05.186]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:05.186 --> 00:51:06.106]  Number 1.
[00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:09.529]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:09.529 --> 00:51:10.389]  Number 2.
[00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:15.292]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.292 --> 00:51:16.033]  It's true.
[00:51:16.033 --> 00:51:20.896]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:21.736]  Number 3.
[00:51:21.736 --> 00:51:25.319]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.319 --> 00:51:29.021]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:29.221 --> 00:51:30.022]  Number 4.
[00:51:30.022 --> 00:51:32.764]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.764 --> 00:51:36.448]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:36.448 --> 00:51:37.249]  Number 5.
[00:51:37.249 --> 00:51:41.392]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:41.392 --> 00:51:46.157]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:52:03.017 --> 00:52:05.340]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.563]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:52:08.563 --> 00:52:13.668]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:52:13.668 --> 00:52:17.852]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:52:18.152 --> 00:52:20.513]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:52:20.513 --> 00:52:23.394]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:52:23.394 --> 00:52:26.316]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:52:26.316 --> 00:52:33.899]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:52:34.252 --> 00:52:39.637]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:52:39.637 --> 00:52:42.499]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:52:42.499 --> 00:52:46.182]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:52:46.182 --> 00:52:47.243]  And I got news for you.
[00:52:47.243 --> 00:52:48.604]  You're everyone else.
[00:52:48.604 --> 00:52:50.085]  Invisible Empire.

[00:52:59.813 --> 00:53:01.174]  This may surprise you.
[00:53:01.174 --> 00:53:05.678]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[00:53:05.678 --> 00:53:07.499]  You or someone you know may have it.
[00:53:07.499 --> 00:53:11.242]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[00:53:11.242 --> 00:53:13.824]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[00:53:13.824 --> 00:53:19.368]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[00:53:19.368 --> 00:53:26.814]  Puriam Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy

[00:54:12.948 --> 00:54:14.009]  Let's make it number one.
[00:54:14.009 --> 00:54:15.829]  Usually takes about three hours.
[00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:18.871]  I was just given a medical daily.
[00:54:20.231 --> 00:54:27.513]  ...article, and this is one of the biggest areas of research, is anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug addiction vaccines.
[00:54:27.513 --> 00:54:32.814]  They lower IQ, they attack the synapses, the receptors in the brain, it's on record.
[00:54:32.814 --> 00:54:36.534]  Here it is, gene limits learning and memory in mice.
[00:54:36.534 --> 00:54:48.937]  And all these big universities, the Pentagon, they're studying the gene CA2, similar to humans, where they can lower the IQ and erase the memories of mice with one succulent injection.
[00:54:49.991 --> 00:54:53.800]  Of course, the USIQ has dropped, depending on the region, 10 to 20 points.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.742]  Fluoride does that alone.
[00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:02.794]  And people probably can't even help themselves right now.
[00:55:02.794 --> 00:55:05.656]  I mean, I'm here telling you they're radiating your houses.
[00:55:05.656 --> 00:55:07.178]  I'm here telling you they're poisoning your water.
[00:55:07.178 --> 00:55:13.923]  And a lot of people are like, you're so mesmerized by the television, by all of it, you don't care.
[00:55:13.923 --> 00:55:18.807]  And there's all these political prostitutes who'll sell out their whole society, their family.
[00:55:18.807 --> 00:55:21.029]  Look, there's no selling out to this.
[00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:22.851]  When it's done and set up, it's going to kill us.
[00:55:24.813 --> 00:55:38.102]  I had a top researcher on who was one of the only people to ever be given access to the Rand Corporation's internal documents, and it was all world government, total domination, dumbing us down, total enslavement, the end of the family, funding wars, staging terror attacks.
[00:55:38.102 --> 00:55:41.565]  I mean, what do you think all of this is about?
[00:55:41.565 --> 00:55:42.906]  What do you think this is?
[00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:45.147]  What do you think hiring the Stasi is?
[00:55:45.147 --> 00:55:48.370]  What do you think training kids to tattle on mommy is?
[00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:51.372]  It's pure evil!
[00:55:51.372 --> 00:55:53.954]  Deleting a certain gene in mice can make them smarter.
[00:55:55.148 --> 00:56:02.633]  By unlocking a mysterious region of the brain considered to be relatively inflexible, scientists at Emory University School of Medicine have found.
[00:56:02.633 --> 00:56:06.355]  But then the government, it goes on, is studying how to turn it off.
[00:56:06.355 --> 00:56:19.564]  Mice with the disabled RGS1-4 gene are able to remember objects they've explored and learned to navigate mazes better than regular mice, suggesting RGS1-4's presence limits some of the learning and memory.
[00:56:21.067 --> 00:56:27.730]  The results were published online this week in the early edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
[00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:36.155]  The RGS14 receptors to hold mice back mentally, John Hepler, PhD professor of pharmacology at Emory University School of Medicine.
[00:56:36.155 --> 00:56:38.616]  And all these scientists are good people, and most of them are.
[00:56:38.616 --> 00:56:39.336]  They're just hired.
[00:56:39.336 --> 00:56:42.118]  They develop the thing to, oh, let's unlock the mind.
[00:56:42.118 --> 00:56:45.919]  And the government's like, hmm, we could turn the mind off with this.
[00:56:45.919 --> 00:56:48.841]  And what does Wired Magazine report that Marshall, the head futurist there,
[00:56:51.158 --> 00:56:52.660]  This just goes on and on.
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:54.381]  These people.
[00:56:54.381 --> 00:56:54.682]  These people.
[00:57:12.546 --> 00:57:13.687]  Oh, heaven help me.
[00:57:13.687 --> 00:57:16.068]  And then I've got this report right here.
[00:57:16.068 --> 00:57:20.911]  Internet's creator slams blight of web disconnection laws.
[00:57:20.911 --> 00:57:29.696]  Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited with inventing the World Wide Web, warned of the blight of new laws being introduced across the globe, allowing people to be cut off from the Internet.
[00:57:30.316 --> 00:57:39.484]  There's been a rash of laws trying to give governments and internet service providers the right and the duty to disconnect people, he told a conference of web science at the Royal Society in London.
[00:57:39.484 --> 00:57:47.991]  The current blight includes French law that comes into effect this year that threatens to cut people off if they illegally download from the internet, and a new British law passed in April which could see similar action.
[00:57:47.991 --> 00:57:49.513]  There's no judge, no jury, they just do it.
[00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:52.387]  Including shutting down whole websites.
[00:57:52.387 --> 00:58:05.210]  If a French family can be forcibly disconnected from the internet by a law for a year because one of their children downloaded something that a company asserts, with no proof, that they should not have downloaded without trial, I think that's kind of inappropriate punishment.
[00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:11.271]  He added, I'd like to go on using the internet if it gets cut off or for some reason... Oh, I don't have the second part of the article.
[00:58:11.271 --> 00:58:12.972]  Did you guys print me that?
[00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:16.932]  Headline, Internet Successor Slams Blind of Web Disconnection Laws.
[00:58:16.932 --> 00:58:17.533]  That's coming up.
[00:58:17.533 --> 00:58:19.073]  We got Mark Dice at the aid after.
[00:58:20.199 --> 00:58:24.101]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:32.346]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.TV, where we're simulcasting a live video right now, and InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:32.346 --> 00:58:36.949]  But the search term we need to get out to everybody, ladies and gentlemen, is key.
[00:58:36.949 --> 00:58:38.490]  Beds radiating Americans.
[00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:38.950]  Stay with us.

[00:58:52.848 --> 00:58:54.269]  To other police action.
[00:58:54.269 --> 00:58:55.530]  Tyranny is here.
[00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:59.412]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:58:59.412 --> 00:59:01.694]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:59:01.694 --> 00:59:07.578]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:59:07.578 --> 00:59:13.822]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:59:14.222 --> 00:59:20.184]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:59:20.184 --> 00:59:24.386]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:59:24.386 --> 00:59:28.667]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:59:28.667 --> 00:59:34.630]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:38.171]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:59:38.171 --> 00:59:40.152]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:59:40.152 --> 00:59:40.592]  It's here.

[00:59:53.207 --> 00:59:55.590]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:58.353]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.047]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.047 --> 01:00:11.629]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.629 --> 01:00:13.191]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:17.375]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:21.439]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:32.952 --> 01:00:49.245]  Coming up in the third hour, we're going to have wide open phones, specifically for people running naked body scanners, TSA folks, Homeland Security, private contractors driving around with these mobile vans, looking through your houses, making your family drive through these.
[01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:53.608]  We've had radiologist engineers on talking about how powerful this radiation is and how deadly.
[01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:57.291]  The mobile trucks, at least ten times that of a chest x-ray.
[01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:00.958]  I want to hear from you.
[01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.679]  Are you concerned about the radiation you're getting?
[01:01:02.679 --> 01:01:06.722]  Do you think about how this violates the Fourth Amendment?
[01:01:06.722 --> 01:01:11.185]  Or are you on too big of a power trip because you've got a security clearance to call into the show?
[01:01:11.185 --> 01:01:13.987]  A security clearance spying on the American people without warrants.
[01:01:13.987 --> 01:01:14.928]  Give me a stinking break.
[01:01:14.928 --> 01:01:15.568]  It's all illegal.
[01:01:15.568 --> 01:01:16.369]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:22.313]  In fact, if you call in during Mark Dice, we'll get to you.
[01:01:22.313 --> 01:01:23.014]  We'll do it right now.
[01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:23.074]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:27.534 --> 01:01:27.654]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:27.654 --> 01:01:33.497]  Been covering it a lot in the last hour.
[01:01:33.497 --> 01:01:36.679]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[01:01:36.679 --> 01:01:38.299]  We're doing the web search today.
[01:01:38.299 --> 01:01:39.960]  Hope you'll help us with this.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.521]  You are our only hope to get this out.
[01:01:42.521 --> 01:01:45.083]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:51.766]  Search term, Feds radiating Americans.
[01:01:51.766 --> 01:01:53.307]  And they've got illegal checkpoints.
[01:01:53.307 --> 01:01:54.507]  This is WSBTV.
[01:01:56.075 --> 01:02:01.196]  Counter-terror operation stops trucks on I-20, runs them through the radiators.
[01:02:01.196 --> 01:02:03.497]  I mean, there it is!
[01:02:03.497 --> 01:02:08.298]  Not just a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but radiation!
[01:02:08.298 --> 01:02:14.419]  It's insane, and I'm done ranting about that for now.
[01:02:14.419 --> 01:02:19.760]  Coming up later in the hour, we're going to premiere the InfoWars version of What in the World Are They Spraying?
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.581]  A great new documentary.
[01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:31.504]  Produced by G. Edward Griffin that went on pre-sale yesterday at InfoWars.com.
[01:02:31.504 --> 01:02:33.025]  We're going to have it first.
[01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:37.726]  We'll be shipping out to you October 22nd, about 23-24 days from now.
[01:02:37.726 --> 01:02:41.487]  If you want to get it first, powerful film documenting chemtrails.
[01:02:41.487 --> 01:02:42.628]  You know, it's declassified.
[01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:44.548]  It's just hidden in plain view.
[01:02:44.548 --> 01:02:45.868]  Very interesting, very informative.
[01:02:45.868 --> 01:02:47.129]  What in the world are they spraying?
[01:02:47.129 --> 01:02:50.530]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling Total Free 888.
[01:02:51.510 --> 01:03:02.095]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9-8-8-8-2-5-3-3-1-3-9 and your purchase of the different books and videos, materials, and t-shirts also funds this operation.
[01:03:02.095 --> 01:03:03.636]  In fact, where did my four endgames go?
[01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:10.199]  I had four endgames sitting here.
[01:03:10.199 --> 01:03:15.341]  We are ending this special tomorrow.
[01:03:15.341 --> 01:03:17.863]  So if you want to take advantage of it, 1995 for the Obama deception.
[01:03:22.254 --> 01:03:28.176]  1995 for this seminal film exposing the left-right paradigm and the globalist agenda.
[01:03:28.176 --> 01:03:30.017]  Biggest film we've ever made.
[01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:40.760]  Get it on DVD, make copies, get out to everyone you know, and get a free copy of Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies, free, $24.95 value, in hardcover.
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.961]  And you can read it, give it to somebody as a Christmas present, whatever, it's a great book.
[01:03:43.961 --> 01:03:46.782]  Covers 14 different documented conspiracies.
[01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.623]  9-11, JFK, the list goes on and on.

[01:04:07.776 --> 01:04:10.738]  But this tyranny is closing in on us.
[01:04:10.738 --> 01:04:14.600]  But the good news is people are waking up all over the world.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.702]  Austerity, anti-austerity protests sweep across Europe.
[01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:26.245]  As they cut off people's welfare, take part of their pension funds, raise taxes, everything goes to the central bankers.
[01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:31.128]  Meanwhile, Gates Buffett hosts banquet for China's super-rich.
[01:04:31.128 --> 01:04:35.451]  French budget makes historic spending cuts.
[01:04:35.451 --> 01:04:37.392]  Obama to liberals is inexcusable.
[01:04:39.907 --> 01:04:46.053]  Stay on election sidelines and Kerry goes further saying they're too stupid to know that globalism is good for them.
[01:04:46.053 --> 01:04:47.695]  That's all coming up.
[01:04:47.695 --> 01:04:52.660]  We're going to get into the attack on the internet and free speech as well.
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.403]  It is all coming up straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[01:04:55.403 --> 01:04:56.904]  Mark Dice will be joining us.
[01:04:56.904 --> 01:04:57.325]  Stay with us.
[01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:16.474]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:16.474 --> 01:05:20.157]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:21.161 --> 01:05:33.931]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:41.197]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:41.877 --> 01:05:52.246]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:56.190]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.293]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:06:01.181 --> 01:06:05.202]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:08.443]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.443 --> 01:06:13.244]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.244 --> 01:06:19.625]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:21.866]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.406 --> 01:06:22.706]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:22.706 --> 01:06:23.227]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.227 --> 01:06:23.887]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:23.887 --> 01:06:25.188]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.188 --> 01:06:27.429]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.317 --> 01:06:48.579]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:48.579 --> 01:06:57.702]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:04.233]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.233 --> 01:07:05.153]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.153 --> 01:07:08.576]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.576 --> 01:07:09.436]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.436 --> 01:07:14.319]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.319 --> 01:07:15.060]  It's true.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.943]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.943 --> 01:07:20.763]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.763 --> 01:07:24.346]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:28.028]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.248 --> 01:07:29.048]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.048 --> 01:07:31.809]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.809 --> 01:07:35.490]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:36.271]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.271 --> 01:07:40.412]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.412 --> 01:07:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.474 --> 01:07:49.655]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:51.435]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:56.037]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:56.397 --> 01:07:59.040]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:08:26.263 --> 01:08:27.424]  We are back live.
[01:08:27.424 --> 01:08:45.794]  We're going to be talking in this hour and the next about the Internet's creator, and no, it's not Al Gore, the true Internet creator, and the French news agency saying governments are killing the web as we know it, openly saying that the web is dying, being shut down.
[01:08:45.794 --> 01:08:47.115]  And that is what's happening.
[01:08:47.115 --> 01:08:50.977]  The designer, the main scientist credited with bringing it all together,
[01:08:52.566 --> 01:08:54.027]  ...is telling you this, okay?
[01:08:54.027 --> 01:08:58.429]  So the denial needs to be over on this issue.
[01:08:58.429 --> 01:09:09.154]  We're going to get into the huge fact that at least 500 vans with high-powered radiation are violating your Fourth Amendment and hitting you with radiation, scanning your house while you're in it.
[01:09:09.154 --> 01:09:13.716]  Got a key report, they've now got highway checkpoints radiating people as they drive through them.
[01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:23.339]  The cops are all just standing out there, right outside the radiation projector, as the truck drives under it, being hit themselves with it.
[01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:26.080]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.362]  It's people literally killing themselves in slow motion.
[01:09:30.362 --> 01:09:37.725]  And it's a soft kill, so when they die 10-15 years down the road, it'll be, oh, we wonder why there's such an increase in this cancer or that cancer.
[01:09:37.725 --> 01:09:38.705]  They've got it all figured out.
[01:09:40.333 --> 01:09:43.614]  We're also going to get into where Mark Dice sees society going.
[01:09:43.614 --> 01:09:47.696]  He's been fighting the New World Order intensely for more than five years.
[01:09:47.696 --> 01:09:51.438]  And he's got a unique and very thought-provoking perspective.
[01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:53.159]  But we see the rise of the Tea Party.
[01:09:53.159 --> 01:09:57.421]  We see world government now being admitted by the globalists as a good thing.
[01:09:57.421 --> 01:10:01.402]  The fake right wing, who denied it existed, now saying, oh, there's a few problems.
[01:10:01.402 --> 01:10:02.683]  Low-level professors run it.
[01:10:03.314 --> 01:10:13.259]  Not the Pentagon, the Globalist, the Rand Corporation, who are on record setting up a socialistic, collectivistic world government.
[01:10:13.259 --> 01:10:15.160]  This collectivist system.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:25.045]  And again, we've gone over all these documents, so many, every week there's new ones, like Global Trends 2025, put out by the National Security Council, saying they want world government.
[01:10:26.909 --> 01:10:29.191]  Okay, the denial is over.
[01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:35.818]  And in this world government, the goal is to set up a control grid and then soft kill you.
[01:10:35.818 --> 01:10:41.444]  But people are waking up to GMO, so the government's trying to pass laws that you can't label if something's non-GMO.
[01:10:41.444 --> 01:10:46.409]  They're not going to let you know if salmons cross species with insect genes and eel genes and rabbit genes.
[01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:53.126]  They're trying to pass laws, you know, where you can't videotape police, but that's being overturned.
[01:10:53.126 --> 01:10:55.008]  Humanity is fighting back.
[01:10:55.008 --> 01:10:58.694]  For all the bad things that are happening, a lot of good is happening as well.
[01:10:58.694 --> 01:11:01.698]  Mark Dice from The Resistance, good to have you on with us.
[01:11:02.816 --> 01:11:08.961]  Well, you know, I wish I wouldn't have to do this, but unfortunately I have a big mouth and this is just something I have to do.
[01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:11.643]  People always say to me, well, you know, why is it?
[01:11:11.643 --> 01:11:13.005]  Do you really believe what you're doing?
[01:11:13.005 --> 01:11:13.725]  Why are you doing this?
[01:11:13.725 --> 01:11:14.306]  Of course I do.
[01:11:14.306 --> 01:11:16.347]  I mean, I can't not do this.
[01:11:16.347 --> 01:11:17.248]  I'm an angry guy.
[01:11:17.248 --> 01:11:20.251]  This is the stuff that I talk about amongst my friends.
[01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:24.694]  And this is the platform that we use to find like-minded people to come together.
[01:11:24.694 --> 01:11:25.275]  And people say,
[01:11:25.855 --> 01:11:27.116]  Are we really doing any good?
[01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:27.977]  We are doing good.
[01:11:27.977 --> 01:11:29.398]  Look at the things that we've changed.
[01:11:29.398 --> 01:11:32.761]  Look at the things that we've stopped or minimized.
[01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:38.146]  And also, there's a micro change as well, because when you become aware of these issues, you change.
[01:11:38.146 --> 01:11:40.928]  You might not even see the change globally, but you yourself change.
[01:11:40.928 --> 01:11:41.829]  Your life changes.
[01:11:41.829 --> 01:11:44.191]  Your family, your relationships, your finances.
[01:11:44.651 --> 01:11:51.479]  Your whole priority changes so you yourself are then pulled out of the system and in a sense saved from it.
[01:11:51.479 --> 01:12:02.612]  So I think we're doing a lot of work and I think that we need to continue but there's some really horrific stuff happening and coming down the line and I think George Orwell predicted it perfectly in his 1949 book on 1984.
[01:12:05.991 --> 01:12:14.277]  And it's quite scary how the ignorance of the population, the social structure, the control of information, the perpetual state of war.
[01:12:14.277 --> 01:12:14.657]  That's right.
[01:12:14.657 --> 01:12:32.609]  He talks in the book about if we could ever get the general public, the lower classes, the proles, who were 90% of the public in that fictional system, but it was based off what he saw in the Soviet Union and what was developing in East Germany, if you could ever get the general public to not care about sports and lottery tickets,
[01:12:33.922 --> 01:12:49.630]  You could get the proles to have endless calculations and mathematics about the supposed lottery, but you couldn't get them to notice that Big Brother said they'd always been at war with East Asia, and the next day they say they've never been at war with East Asia.
[01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.911]  He said, why won't they stand up?
[01:12:51.911 --> 01:12:55.293]  Why won't they wake up?
[01:12:55.293 --> 01:12:56.273]  And now here we are.
[01:12:56.273 --> 01:12:57.054]  Now here we are, Mark.
[01:12:57.694 --> 01:13:00.476]  You know, a quote, to quote him, he says here, quote,
[01:13:20.109 --> 01:13:29.235]  And when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontentment led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus on petty grievances.
[01:13:30.501 --> 01:13:34.345]  And that's what Glenn Beck is doing in the final equation.
[01:13:34.345 --> 01:13:40.091]  He's admitting much of the world government but claiming it's Obama and some mid-level professors.
[01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:48.761]  When meanwhile, globalism is billions a year in government payments to Fox TV and news as part of behavior placement.
[01:13:48.761 --> 01:13:49.742]  All the networks get it.
[01:13:50.442 --> 01:14:01.006]  And the Pentagon and Rand Corporation and Ford Foundation on record have set all this up, including the Soviet Union, the Ford Foundation and others, and the Carnegie before that.
[01:14:01.006 --> 01:14:04.247]  I mean, it's on record they want collectivism.
[01:14:04.247 --> 01:14:05.787]  That's what globalism is.
[01:14:05.787 --> 01:14:07.468]  But again, McCarthy
[01:14:08.428 --> 01:14:14.091]  He was okay, as long as he was blaming low-level file clerks and janitors and calling them up.
[01:14:14.091 --> 01:14:21.054]  But when he found out the Pentagon was running communism, and he found out there was a plan to merge our nations, it was over for Joseph McCarthy.
[01:14:21.715 --> 01:14:26.157]  Well, yeah, the Pentagon actually funded back in the 70s the RFID program.
[01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:31.940]  They actually called it the MARC card, the Multi-Technical Automated Reader card, the MARC card.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.902]  So the Department of Defense funded that.
[01:14:33.902 --> 01:14:39.124]  It was tested back again in the 1990s at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.
[01:14:39.124 --> 01:14:43.967]  Interesting how the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, all these foundations fund a lot of this stuff.
[01:14:43.967 --> 01:14:49.490]  You know, I found that the top facial recognition software company, Vizionics,
[01:14:50.089 --> 01:14:50.390]  Let's do it.
[01:15:02.626 --> 01:15:03.986]  Everything is, Mark!
[01:15:03.986 --> 01:15:16.250]  We've got stuff from 66 where they said we're going to develop a hormone added to a tetanus shot to sterilize women, and the great part is they're still going to be able to get pregnant, but they'll have a miscarriage at the start of the second trimester.
[01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:25.392]  It's a perfect secret weapon, and the added goody, this is all declassified, is that the miscarriages kill some of the women, so it's even better.
[01:15:25.392 --> 01:15:26.393]  Oh, how luscious!
[01:15:26.393 --> 01:15:27.193]  I mean, you name it,
[01:15:28.653 --> 01:15:36.175]  The Rockefeller Foundation, others funded the Rand Corporation, all of them, everything, everything you see they designed.
[01:15:36.175 --> 01:15:44.917]  And it's so incredible how so much of this Big Brother technology really is just quackery and designed to keep everybody intimidated, not to detect any terrorists.
[01:15:44.917 --> 01:15:50.738]  Let's look at this plan to put microphones and cameras in the plane seats in the European Union.
[01:15:51.258 --> 01:15:54.281]  This is actually quite foolish, and they're taking it seriously.
[01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:58.464]  They're looking at funding, they're considering actually implementing this.
[01:15:58.464 --> 01:16:00.947]  Let's take a look at how effective this would actually be.
[01:16:00.947 --> 01:16:09.073]  You're telling me that a couple of terrorists are going to be sitting on an airplane and say to the guy next to them, hey, Mohammed, in five minutes, let's hijack this airplane.
[01:16:09.073 --> 01:16:12.516]  I'll take out the pilot and you make sure to kill the stewardess.
[01:16:12.516 --> 01:16:13.177]  I mean, it's just absurd.
[01:16:14.198 --> 01:16:17.903]  But it's even absurd to even address it as if they're a real terrorist.
[01:16:17.903 --> 01:16:20.666]  This is to train you that you're going to be watched 24-7.
[01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:27.655]  They admit the airports and airplanes are the beta test for the streets, just like the naked body scanners are now rolling out on the streets.
[01:16:28.854 --> 01:16:29.715]  You might be aware of this.
[01:16:29.715 --> 01:16:31.036]  Some of the listeners might be aware of this.
[01:16:31.036 --> 01:16:35.079]  There's a program that's been in testing since 2006 in Holland.
[01:16:35.079 --> 01:16:48.689]  They may actually implement it in London for the 2012 Olympics, where the cameras are not only now going to watch you, they're going to listen to you and record conversations from 100 yards away and analyze the speech to determine if somebody's being hostile.
[01:16:49.569 --> 01:16:50.029]  No, I'm good.
[01:17:10.814 --> 01:17:18.339]  Yeah, you better shut up and stay in your house and watch TV, which your TiVo's actually tracking what you're watching and doing and reporting it back.
[01:17:18.339 --> 01:17:29.806]  But actually, three years ago, all over England, they put up cameras that have a mean-looking face on them with a TV screen, that when you talk too loud or do something, it screams orders at you.
[01:17:29.806 --> 01:17:33.469]  So the actual telescreen, and as you know, six years ago,
[01:17:34.309 --> 01:17:40.534]  They put up posters all over London with an all-seeing eye saying, safe under the eye of Big Brother.
[01:17:40.534 --> 01:17:41.835]  So they're coming out and saying 1984 is good!
[01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:56.777]  Yeah, remember there's a 1993 film, Demolition Man, with Sylvester Stallone, and there were these devices listening all over, and if somebody were to say a bad word, the device would hear them and actually charge them a fine.
[01:17:56.777 --> 01:18:01.819]  And we're actually coming to that, and again, it's fascinating to see how George Orwell predicted all this.
[01:18:01.819 --> 01:18:04.820]  I want to throw another quote out there from him, again, from his 1949 book.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:10.803]  This book was written before VCRs, microwaves, colored television, but yet he foresaw
[01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:12.303]  And now,
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.600]  I don't have computers in my bedroom.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.661]  I have to turn my iPhone off and put it away.
[01:18:44.661 --> 01:18:48.782]  And because I'm aware of the total surveillance, I'm already living like Winston Smith.
[01:18:48.782 --> 01:18:51.482]  I mean, do you ever catch yourself doing that, Mark?
[01:18:51.482 --> 01:18:55.183]  I have a piece of black tape taped over the camera on my laptop.
[01:18:55.183 --> 01:19:00.223]  And I had this up there before this case broke of the students being spied on by their school.
[01:19:00.223 --> 01:19:01.604]  And I had friends of mine laugh at me.
[01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:03.904]  And they'd say, oh, hell, the government's going to be watching you.
[01:19:03.904 --> 01:19:09.085]  And then I emailed them the article of the school that was spying on the students on their laptops when they were at home.
[01:19:10.194 --> 01:19:12.275]  And the judge ruled that's okay.
[01:19:12.275 --> 01:19:17.677]  There were tens of thousands of videos and images of them dressing, undressing, showering.
[01:19:17.677 --> 01:19:20.318]  And it all broke because a kid was eating Skittles.
[01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:23.320]  And the school called him in and said, we saw you taking drugs.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.501]  They were watching them in their bedrooms.
[01:19:25.501 --> 01:19:29.082]  And they even released on the news images of teenagers asleep in their beds.
[01:19:29.082 --> 01:19:32.124]  And the government said, it's good.
[01:19:32.124 --> 01:19:32.664]  It's good.
[01:19:32.664 --> 01:19:34.845]  There's some very disturbing
[01:19:35.626 --> 01:19:37.206]  GPS systems coming out.
[01:19:37.206 --> 01:19:44.788]  Actually, one of them is already on the market now to start training the little kids when they're three, four, five years old that this is how society is.
[01:19:44.788 --> 01:19:46.109]  You're constantly watched.
[01:19:46.109 --> 01:19:48.329]  Mom and Dad constantly listen to you.
[01:19:48.329 --> 01:19:49.249]  You might have seen this.
[01:19:49.249 --> 01:19:51.890]  There's a device called the Amber Alert GPS system.
[01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:52.250]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:52.730]  Stay there.
[01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:53.090]  Stay there.
[01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:57.491]  Meanwhile, DynCorp kidnaps literally hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children.
[01:19:57.491 --> 01:19:58.512]  It's in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:19:58.512 --> 01:19:59.312]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[01:20:02.452 --> 01:20:04.196]  What is a wind generator?
[01:20:04.196 --> 01:20:06.602]  How can the wind produce power for a small cabin?
[01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:09.970]  How can wind energy be stored and used during an emergency?
[01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:11.914]  Can I assemble my own wind generator?

[01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:27.051]  And again, it's absolutely free.
[01:21:27.051 --> 01:21:29.073]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[01:21:29.073 --> 01:21:32.796]  For instance, if you want to remodel your home, go to HomeGain.com.
[01:21:32.796 --> 01:21:39.461]  Use their Home Sale Maximizer to help you determine which home improvements can most increase your home's value before you put it on the market.
[01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:42.504]  For 10 years, these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[01:21:42.944 --> 01:21:45.246]  Visit their link at InfoWars.com.
[01:21:45.246 --> 01:21:50.551]  Look for Max, the Orange Home Game Gorilla, to help you with any real estate needs you might have.
[01:21:50.551 --> 01:21:51.752]  You'll love this site.
[01:21:51.752 --> 01:21:53.614]  It's HomeGame.com.
[01:21:53.614 --> 01:21:56.436]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N.com.
[01:21:56.436 --> 01:21:57.197]  Check them out today.
[01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:02.669]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:04.691]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:04.691 --> 01:22:05.612]  debt crises.
[01:22:05.612 --> 01:22:06.632]  You heard me right.
[01:22:06.632 --> 01:22:09.114]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:22:09.114 --> 01:22:12.777]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:12.777 --> 01:22:19.643]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:20.003 --> 01:22:21.404]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.404 --> 01:22:28.607]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:28.607 --> 01:22:36.431]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:36.431 --> 01:22:40.392]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:40.392 --> 01:22:42.553]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:46.255 --> 01:22:52.564]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:52.564 --> 01:22:54.988]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:22:54.988 --> 01:22:55.329]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.382 --> 01:23:02.563]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:04.324]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:23:04.324 --> 01:23:05.525]  Don't waste your money!
[01:23:05.525 --> 01:23:11.848]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam, and pop-ups.
[01:23:11.848 --> 01:23:13.528]  You don't need to buy a new computer.
[01:23:13.528 --> 01:23:17.931]  Just go to DoubleMySpeed.com and find out what's slowing your computer down.
[01:23:17.931 --> 01:23:21.833]  DoubleMySpeed totally cleaned up my system and increased my speed.
[01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:25.794]  DoubleMySpeed.com increased the speed of my computer from the very first day.
[01:23:25.794 --> 01:23:27.795]  My computer was on its last leg.

[01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:58.005]  That's DoubleMySpeed.com.
[01:24:10.439 --> 01:24:15.200]  MarkDice.com is the website.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.840]  He's written multiple books.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.841]  We carry them all at InfoWars.com.
[01:24:18.841 --> 01:24:24.602]  They're excellent, including one titled The Illuminati and The Resistance.
[01:24:24.602 --> 01:24:27.783]  I know we got a lot of callers who are military, radiologists.
[01:24:28.615 --> 01:24:29.497]  TSA.
[01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.320]  We're going to take your calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.208]  I'll keep Dice a little bit in the next hour as well because he's got so much to talk about.
[01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.971]  But Mark, do you agree with me that...
[01:24:38.127 --> 01:24:42.448]  The global architects, the social engineers, know there's an awakening.
[01:24:42.448 --> 01:24:44.149]  In fact, Zbigniew Brzezinski admits that.
[01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:46.129]  The greatest awakening, he calls it.
[01:24:46.129 --> 01:24:49.971]  And so they're trying to bum rush us and just get everything in place right now.
[01:24:49.971 --> 01:24:52.791]  Because Google's coming out and saying we can predict the future.
[01:24:52.791 --> 01:24:54.312]  We're tracking everything you do.
[01:24:54.312 --> 01:24:55.132]  We are evil.
[01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:58.213]  We are the government.
[01:24:58.213 --> 01:25:00.894]  I mean, they're just everywhere admitting all of this now, Mark.
[01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:08.217]  Yeah, and the consensus is to still make us feel like we're the weirdos, we're quackery.
[01:25:08.217 --> 01:25:12.339]  But I mean, look at this technology that they say that's supposedly going to predict all this stuff.
[01:25:12.339 --> 01:25:21.803]  It is largely quackery, the mind scanners, supposedly being able to read your mind and tell if you've had experiential knowledge of things.
[01:25:21.803 --> 01:25:24.444]  This is all coming in the next probably 10 to 15 years.
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:27.601]  And it's so scary.
[01:25:27.601 --> 01:25:35.988]  I mean, before the break I was mentioning this new GPS device that's about the size of a 50 cent piece that parents are attaching onto their children.
[01:25:35.988 --> 01:25:39.510]  And it just shows on their cell phone where their little two-year-old is at all times.
[01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:47.356]  And it also has a microphone in it so they can use their cell phone to listen to their child to see what he's talking about.
[01:25:47.356 --> 01:25:49.338]  And this is all just becoming normal.
[01:25:49.338 --> 01:25:50.419]  And Facebook, of course,
[01:25:51.289 --> 01:25:58.918]  Just caused everybody to fall in love with Big Brother, telling them what they do, think and feel, where they're at at any particular moment.
[01:25:58.918 --> 01:26:06.527]  But Mark, entire public schools are fitting all the kids with RFID, and in some cases, the GPS trackers.
[01:26:06.527 --> 01:26:10.892]  And now, for unpaid parking tickets, they're going to make you wear an anklet bracelet.
[01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:24.640]  Yeah, the funny thing is that most people now using Facebook with over 500 million users are willingly handing over their deepest thoughts, all of their personal information, their family members, where they work.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:29.502]  The social implications just on that alone are immense.
[01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:30.343]  And then I put out a
[01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:36.062]  A press release a couple weeks ago trying to urge people to log off of Facebook for a week.
[01:26:36.062 --> 01:26:38.184]  I called it Facebook Free Week.
[01:26:38.184 --> 01:26:40.906]  And I got a little flack even from some of the movement.
[01:26:40.906 --> 01:26:42.547]  People think that, oh, this is 9-11.
[01:26:42.547 --> 01:26:47.671]  Look, there's more to the New World Order than the Big Brother, the economy, the police, state terrorism.
[01:26:47.671 --> 01:26:50.913]  There's a whole social aspect of it as well.
[01:26:50.913 --> 01:26:56.498]  And if we are turning ourselves, our society, into a bunch of self-absorbed narcissists
[01:26:57.018 --> 01:27:00.521]  Not focusing on real events, but just on what I'm doing.
[01:27:00.521 --> 01:27:03.122]  Look at what's happened in the last few years with Facebook.
[01:27:03.122 --> 01:27:10.667]  Every day, millions of people post multiple times a day what it is that they're doing as if the world literally revolves around them.
[01:27:10.667 --> 01:27:12.248]  Oh, I just had a great breakfast.
[01:27:12.248 --> 01:27:14.030]  I just had a good latte.
[01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:15.611]  It's a beautiful morning today.
[01:27:15.611 --> 01:27:16.751]  I'm gonna go here.
[01:27:16.751 --> 01:27:17.972]  Oh, I'm doing here.
[01:27:17.972 --> 01:27:19.673]  Look at my new picture of myself.
[01:27:19.673 --> 01:27:21.555]  Don't I look really pretty?
[01:27:21.555 --> 01:27:23.896]  It's fascinating and it's probably me that's saying this.
[01:27:23.896 --> 01:27:26.638]  I started noticing this even amongst my actual friends.
[01:27:27.378 --> 01:27:43.025]  I put out Facebook Free Week and then immediately I started seeing these real studies from universities, the University of Michigan, York University in Canada, and they're confirming this, that society is becoming extremely narcissistic, less empathetic than they were 20 or 30 years ago.
[01:27:43.405 --> 01:27:44.506]  But it's worse than that.
[01:27:44.506 --> 01:28:04.975]  The vocabulary, as Orwell wrote about, the object of Ingsoc was to destroy words, limit vocabulary to just say double plus good, to where someone can't even communicate to you complex thoughts because you don't have the semantical symbols in your mental lexicon or thesaurus to be able to even understand
[01:28:06.098 --> 01:28:15.323]  What they're saying, and the Buffalo News reported that, oh yeah, the police are getting all this data-mined Facebook Google stuff to quote, predict what you're doing pre-crime.
[01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:18.612]  Yeah, that's probably coming down.
[01:28:18.612 --> 01:28:20.093]  It's so, so scary now.
[01:28:20.093 --> 01:28:27.981]  I mean, we have Orwell here said, it's terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in a public place within range of a telescreen.
[01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:39.072]  The smallest thing could give you away, a nervous tick, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself, anything that carried the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide.
[01:28:41.164 --> 01:28:51.892]  And now they're putting the telescreens in that both receive and transmit, and they say, if you look unhappy or you're sweating, that's the evidence they need to take you away.
[01:28:51.892 --> 01:29:02.780]  There was a case in India of a woman being convicted of murder, actually, from a brain scan that said that she had experiential knowledge of the crime scene.
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:08.344]  So now they're developing these devices, they're called functional MRIs, fMRIs, that allegedly
[01:29:09.388 --> 01:29:23.778]  They believe, or at least they're purporting them to, be able to detect in your mind whether you have been somewhere or whether you have actually seen something or heard something.
[01:29:23.778 --> 01:29:28.761]  And we know that this is all going to start becoming standard operating procedure.
[01:29:28.761 --> 01:29:34.225]  And lie detectors aren't even allowed in a court of law because they're not completely accurate.
[01:29:34.225 --> 01:29:35.386]  It's largely quackery.
[01:29:35.762 --> 01:29:38.064]  And there's a whole other angle to this.
[01:29:38.064 --> 01:29:46.431]  All these big defense department affiliated companies, they're getting these trillions and trillions of contracts over the decades.
[01:29:46.431 --> 01:29:48.692]  So they're also profiting from enslaving us.
[01:29:48.692 --> 01:29:50.994]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.994 --> 01:29:52.395]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.395 --> 01:29:54.937]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.937 --> 01:29:57.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.356 --> 01:30:04.559]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.559 --> 01:30:10.964]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:30:10.964 --> 01:30:18.370]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:23.233]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:32:02.748 --> 01:32:06.531]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:32:06.531 --> 01:32:09.414]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:32:09.414 --> 01:32:14.339]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[01:32:14.799 --> 01:32:20.721]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[01:32:20.721 --> 01:32:26.404]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.

[01:33:01.977 --> 01:33:07.981]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:07.981 --> 01:33:12.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:12.924 --> 01:33:17.768]  The attempt to shut down the internet as we know it is now out in the open.
[01:33:17.768 --> 01:33:25.873]  Even a French news agency quoting the creator of the internet, and again it's not Al Gore, saying they are in the process of shutting the web down.
[01:33:25.873 --> 01:33:27.134]  The denial is over.
[01:33:28.444 --> 01:33:29.385]  That is coming up.
[01:33:29.385 --> 01:33:32.287]  I want to get into the economy as well.
[01:33:32.287 --> 01:33:36.350]  I've got the new InfoWars.com trailer for What in the World Are They Spraying?
[01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:41.053]  Chemtrail documentary now on pre-order at InfoWars.com coming out October 22nd.

[01:33:46.877 --> 01:33:55.325]  And we've got this other special running, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, the seminal film on the Eugenics Master Plan.
[01:33:55.325 --> 01:33:57.527]  Almost three hours long, very well done.
[01:33:57.527 --> 01:33:59.949]  I think this is my most important film.
[01:33:59.949 --> 01:34:01.891]  Four copies, $19.95.
[01:34:01.891 --> 01:34:04.213]  Buy one, get three free, basically.
[01:34:04.213 --> 01:34:06.195]  And your purchase does also support the broadcast.
[01:34:07.156 --> 01:34:08.298]  This film is so important.
[01:34:08.298 --> 01:34:09.460]  All my films are so important.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:11.804]  They're free on YouTube and Google and other places.
[01:34:11.804 --> 01:34:13.687]  They're not anywhere near this quality.
[01:34:13.687 --> 01:34:14.669]  But get those links.
[01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:16.131]  If you can't afford them, send them out to people.
[01:34:16.131 --> 01:34:19.337]  Or even if you buy the DVDs, get the links on YouTube.
[01:34:19.337 --> 01:34:20.178]  Just Google Endgame.
[01:34:21.161 --> 01:34:21.301]  Yes.
[01:34:42.007 --> 01:34:46.672]  I mean, even if you're immoral and want to rob somebody, are you stupid enough to think you're going to be getting it?
[01:34:46.672 --> 01:34:51.196]  Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement DVD at the online video bookstore shopping cart.
[01:34:51.196 --> 01:34:52.197]  Infowars.com.
[01:34:52.197 --> 01:34:55.460]  This special ends next week.
[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:59.984]  Going back to Mark Dice, I was looking at the front page of MarkDice.com.
[01:34:59.984 --> 01:35:02.046]  We'll put it up on screen for Prison Planet.
[01:35:03.268 --> 01:35:03.548]  I don't
[01:35:22.359 --> 01:35:28.463]  Who I think is even more amazing than Eric Blair, aka George Orwell, was of course Aldous Huxley.
[01:35:28.463 --> 01:35:34.046]  He wrote in 32, Brave New World, and before he died in 62, he said, this is actually what we're planning.
[01:35:34.046 --> 01:35:37.709]  And his brother, of course, ran UNESCO at the UN at the time.
[01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:40.131]  People read that book and they go, this is what's happening now.
[01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:42.652]  Well, that's how advanced their technologies are.
[01:35:42.652 --> 01:35:48.917]  We'll put that monkey back up on screen for folks, if they're not watching presentplanet.tv, they can go to markdice.com.
[01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:54.938]  Look at it, but that's basically how the globalists see humans.
[01:35:54.938 --> 01:35:59.159]  Finish up your point about narcissism because people say, well, hey, it is all about me.
[01:35:59.159 --> 01:36:03.260]  Yeah, but once everybody is like that, then no one cares about anybody else.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:07.241]  And you were talking about all the studies showing people have lost their empathy.
[01:36:07.241 --> 01:36:10.202]  Sometimes I'll go review a movie because I've got to go watch it.
[01:36:10.982 --> 01:36:11.222]  I think?
[01:36:26.391 --> 01:36:29.552]  People now laugh at car accidents with someone's head cut off.
[01:36:29.552 --> 01:36:38.174]  They now see a woman, a famous case in Toronto a few years ago, being raped in the main street, beaten with a lead pipe, and for two plus hours no one helped her.
[01:36:38.174 --> 01:36:45.756]  And the boss at one telecommunications company, it was in the news, told his employees, don't call the police, we don't have time to even deal with them.
[01:36:45.756 --> 01:36:46.736]  Let her bleed.
[01:36:46.736 --> 01:36:50.317]  Everyone giggled and felt official and powerful.
[01:36:50.317 --> 01:36:51.797]  That's what yuppies do.
[01:36:51.797 --> 01:36:55.678]  You warn them about, hey, these naked body scanners, they're recording them, it bathes you in radiation.
[01:36:56.058 --> 01:36:58.739]  And they just go, uh-huh, sure.
[01:36:58.739 --> 01:37:13.123]  Well, it's interesting that Facebook and MySpace, these sites are called social and networking sites, but really they are social isolation sites because they supplement, in an artificial way, actual friendships and actual relationships.
[01:37:13.123 --> 01:37:20.285]  And again, some people attack me for talking about this, but I take a holistic approach to fighting the New World Order, not just 9-11, the police, the Big Brother,
[01:37:21.005 --> 01:37:21.365]  We're good to go.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:48.929]  Uh, and the site, I believe, tricks people into feeling that they're actually interacting with their quote-unquote friends.
[01:37:48.929 --> 01:37:56.438]  Of course, many of them are not even friends, not even really acquaintances, just random people they've met maybe once that have, uh, then cyberstalked them and sent them a friend request.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:07.288]  But it's fascinating to see how, if you log on to Facebook every day, as most people do, your mind is tricked into believing that you have these people in your life.
[01:38:07.288 --> 01:38:12.772]  If you can see a status update, a picture, your brain is tricked into thinking that they're actually in your life, but they're not!
[01:38:12.772 --> 01:38:19.437]  You know, go and have dinner, go have Taco Tuesdays, go have some drinks, have a barbecue, have some people over, have your real friends over.
[01:38:19.437 --> 01:38:21.419]  It's just unbelievable how
[01:38:21.499 --> 01:38:28.008]  Well, Facebook has taken over, and there's so many other implications to Facebook.
[01:38:28.008 --> 01:38:37.843]  The Big Brother aspect-wise, selling your photographs, I mean, we wonder how, when Elliot Spitzer's hooker scandal broke, all of a sudden her photo and her family
[01:38:38.463 --> 01:38:40.645]  Photos were all over the news.
[01:38:40.645 --> 01:38:41.345]  How did that happen?
[01:38:41.345 --> 01:38:42.866]  Well, because they were on MySpace.
[01:38:42.866 --> 01:38:49.451]  And if you read the contract that you enter into, the Terms of Service on MySpace or Facebook, they own your photos.
[01:38:49.451 --> 01:38:53.134]  You are licensing the photos to them.
[01:38:53.134 --> 01:39:05.002]  There's also just countless instances of the police posing as beautiful girls and sending college students friend requests on Facebook and then going through their photos and finding pictures of them with alcohol.
[01:39:05.702 --> 01:39:08.525]  Well, I tend to agree with you overall, Mark.
[01:39:19.554 --> 01:39:22.455]  But it's just like the Matrix.
[01:39:22.455 --> 01:39:25.456]  You've got to jack into the Matrix to reach people.
[01:39:25.456 --> 01:39:33.040]  But I think we should go on Facebook and MySpace, as I've done, and criticize the system and point out what's happening.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.321]  I mean, it's like iPhones and cell phones.
[01:39:35.321 --> 01:39:38.462]  Since 1996, we knew from the Telecommunications Act,
[01:39:38.962 --> 01:39:42.044]  That they track you in real time, they listen to you, they dial in.
[01:39:42.044 --> 01:39:44.606]  Google has the patents in your home computer.
[01:39:44.606 --> 01:39:53.831]  Five years ago, they're watching you at home over the camera and you tell people this and they just can't believe it because it's so over the top, but it's admitted.
[01:39:53.831 --> 01:39:58.634]  And then Google says, well, it's computers that are watching you and listening to you and logging keywords.
[01:39:58.634 --> 01:40:02.557]  So it's okay, but then humans at Google have access to that.
[01:40:03.157 --> 01:40:15.576]  I'm not saying Facebook is bad, you shouldn't use it, but I use it, and you use it, a lot of people use it to get out information, valuable news information, social criticism, things like that.
[01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:18.560]  And it even does have its social functions amongst your friends.
[01:40:19.241 --> 01:40:20.162]  Let me be clear.
[01:40:20.162 --> 01:40:23.465]  I'm not criticizing you saying it's wrong what you're saying.
[01:40:23.465 --> 01:40:26.308]  I 110% agree with you.
[01:40:26.308 --> 01:40:28.390]  And it's also who runs the platform.
[01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:30.132]  We know Facebook's a government front.
[01:40:30.132 --> 01:40:33.135]  We know Google is an admitted government front.
[01:40:33.135 --> 01:40:38.720]  We know that, you know, they call their people dumb idiots or they actually use cuss words to trust them.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.021]  We know they're doing that.
[01:40:41.002 --> 01:40:49.565]  I'm saying something more like Meetup, though, where it is about getting together and then organizing through that medium and then hitting the streets.
[01:40:49.565 --> 01:40:55.086]  I think that's the key, is to go on Facebook, Myspace, all these systems, and to use it.
[01:40:55.086 --> 01:41:04.529]  That's why, coming up October 13th or October 14th, it's done, we're doing it, it's taken a year to do, it's just as good or even better than Facebook.
[01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:10.054]  But with our system, you basically don't have to give us anything to sign up except for an email address.
[01:41:10.054 --> 01:41:12.376]  We can turn it off if they post porn or anything.
[01:41:12.376 --> 01:41:14.078]  It's going to be a clean site.
[01:41:14.078 --> 01:41:15.499]  Turn off their page.
[01:41:15.499 --> 01:41:20.263]  But we're going to have a system to get people together, and I'll tell you why.
[01:41:21.084 --> 01:41:24.628]  We had a little cheat program that was easy to use.
[01:41:24.628 --> 01:41:26.991]  It got about 27,000 members.
[01:41:26.991 --> 01:41:28.713]  It was the InfoWars social network.
[01:41:28.713 --> 01:41:30.595]  People ran their own scripts.
[01:41:30.595 --> 01:41:31.956]  It crashed.
[01:41:31.956 --> 01:41:37.422]  You know, this system we've got is a thousand times literally more robust and won't be having that problem.
[01:41:37.422 --> 01:41:37.522]  But
[01:41:38.423 --> 01:41:42.127]  So many people said they met their wife or their husband through it.
[01:41:42.127 --> 01:41:46.652]  I went to the UFC because I was invited to it and I went to the UFC in Austin.
[01:41:46.652 --> 01:41:56.462]  I had two separate couples come up, great-looking couples, who met over the InfoWars social network of only 27,000 people because it didn't work very well.
[01:41:59.465 --> 01:42:01.466]  There's going to be videos on this, announcements.
[01:42:01.466 --> 01:42:04.907]  I'm going to say, don't just try to get a bunch of friends here.
[01:42:04.907 --> 01:42:11.909]  We're going to have areas for folks that are into the Second Amendment, folks that are into land rights, people that are into non-GMO and gardening.
[01:42:11.909 --> 01:42:14.689]  We're going to have places for people to socially get together.
[01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:18.650]  We're not going to call it dating, but it's going to be, hey, you want to make a bowling league?
[01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:22.151]  You want to find other patriots?
[01:42:22.151 --> 01:42:24.472]  That's why I'm so excited about this.
[01:42:24.472 --> 01:42:26.192]  Use their matrix system to reach them.
[01:42:26.192 --> 01:42:27.913]  Here's another example, as I was saying earlier.
[01:42:28.593 --> 01:42:33.197]  The iPhone, Mark, is a tool of dehumanization and enslavement.
[01:42:33.197 --> 01:42:36.841]  You know, it's a computer you take around with you, a whole database of what you've done.
[01:42:36.841 --> 01:42:38.963]  People then say, well, why do you have an iPhone app?
[01:42:39.915 --> 01:42:56.102]  Because we're going into the matrix with the free iPhone app that even if you don't have an iPhone, you go get the free app link at InfoWars.com, you send it to everyone you know, and now they can just click one little button and hear the show wherever they are and get access to the free podcast and the rest of it.
[01:42:56.102 --> 01:42:58.584]  So there's the example of what I'm saying.
[01:42:58.584 --> 01:42:59.704]  iPhones are bad.
[01:42:59.704 --> 01:43:02.605]  They're designed to control you, designed to surveil you.
[01:43:02.605 --> 01:43:06.627]  The government can just flip the camera on in it and watch whatever you're doing and listen to you.
[01:43:06.627 --> 01:43:07.328]  They admit it.
[01:43:08.368 --> 01:43:13.772]  Pretty soon, that'll probably be considered, you probably won't have any reasonable expectation of privacy.
[01:43:13.772 --> 01:43:23.919]  I wouldn't be surprised if they changed the laws in the New World Order that says that, well, if you're, you know, within talking distance of your cell phone, you really, you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
[01:43:23.919 --> 01:43:26.901]  So you'll have data mining systems like Echelon just constantly
[01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.462]  Listening to everyone.
[01:43:29.462 --> 01:43:31.063]  It's quite incredible.
[01:43:31.063 --> 01:43:33.064]  You know, I agree with you.
[01:43:33.064 --> 01:43:35.045]  I use Facebook to get out the word.
[01:43:35.045 --> 01:43:37.226]  And occasionally it doesn't even have some good social aspects.
[01:43:37.226 --> 01:43:42.428]  You know, if you want to post a thing and say, hey, we're all going to go down to, you know, whatever restaurant tonight if you want to come.
[01:43:42.428 --> 01:43:46.770]  Or it is a way, but it's just gotten kind of taken over.
[01:43:46.770 --> 01:43:50.132]  And the narcissistic aspects have just run rampant.
[01:43:50.132 --> 01:43:52.613]  And I don't know, many people might not even be aware of
[01:43:53.573 --> 01:44:05.898]  Some of the other aspects of Facebook, just opening your whole world up to your audience, obviously, as maybe some of the newer audience haven't considered some of these thoughts, but there's a lot of instances of people's homes being burglarized.
[01:44:05.898 --> 01:44:07.119]  Oh yeah, that's huge.
[01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:11.681]  I mean, that's why with our Facebook, it's all our articles and stuff we want people to see.
[01:44:13.121 --> 01:44:14.242]  I think that's the main message.
[01:44:14.242 --> 01:44:18.183]  Don't put anything on Facebook that you don't want the whole world to see.
[01:44:32.609 --> 01:44:38.731]  Get friend requests after somebody says hello to them, essentially, and they can track them down because they know who one of their friends are.
[01:44:38.731 --> 01:44:41.892]  They just go to their friends list, find their friend, send the friend request.
[01:44:41.892 --> 01:44:57.738]  Then the beautiful girl feels rude if she denies them, so they collect a thousand friends, and then these people they don't even know, haven't met once maybe years ago, now know everything about them, where they live, where they work, what they do, and there's countless aspects of people burglarizing people's homes because they'll just post on their
[01:44:57.978 --> 01:45:08.703]  Hey, I'm going to Hawaii for a week, or they'll post pictures when they're there, and then they have their address so that even their quote-unquote friends know where they live, and so they know that they're gone, they go and break into their house.
[01:45:08.703 --> 01:45:09.724]  It's absurd.
[01:45:09.724 --> 01:45:12.745]  So just be careful, and you know, it is a double-edged sword.
[01:45:12.745 --> 01:45:13.485]  It can be used.
[01:45:13.485 --> 01:45:14.146]  I have an iPhone.
[01:45:14.146 --> 01:45:16.707]  I think it's fantastic for getting email on the go.
[01:45:16.707 --> 01:45:19.328]  I have a, you know, a video camera with me if anything happens.
[01:45:19.328 --> 01:45:20.869]  I can videotape something.
[01:45:20.869 --> 01:45:22.610]  It does have its use, but let's
[01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:26.234]  There's also a lot of disinfo on the web.
[01:45:26.234 --> 01:45:33.582]  I've talked to other Alex Joneses because there's probably last count over 15 in Austin and they're constantly writing me.
[01:45:34.665 --> 01:45:36.746]  And saying, please tell people I'm not you.
[01:45:36.746 --> 01:45:38.286]  People come to my door at night.
[01:45:38.286 --> 01:45:40.387]  People come to my work.
[01:45:40.387 --> 01:45:43.708]  People go to my website.
[01:45:43.708 --> 01:45:48.670]  I've gotten calls from Alex Joneses in England and Canada saying, stop it.
[01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:51.691]  Tell people I'm not you.
[01:45:51.691 --> 01:45:52.652]  It's incredible, Mark.
[01:45:53.749 --> 01:46:01.232]  You know, there's this Orwellian nightmare having such dramatic effects, and it's just getting started because look what happened.
[01:46:01.232 --> 01:46:08.634]  I mean, the iPhone's an incredible piece of technology that's just come out in the last few years, but what's going to come down the road in the next ten years is going to be utterly scary.
[01:46:08.634 --> 01:46:11.895]  I mean, there's instances of gang members.
[01:46:11.895 --> 01:46:16.277]  I've seen on the show Gangland on the History Channel back even before the Internet.
[01:46:16.277 --> 01:46:21.519]  Now, they're using Facebook in South America to carry out, in some cases, you know, multiple hits per day.
[01:46:22.219 --> 01:46:25.401]  Well, what these gang members are doing is they're paying corrupt cops.
[01:46:25.401 --> 01:46:29.204]  They would get a license plate number of a drug dealer, a competitive drug dealer.
[01:46:29.204 --> 01:46:32.547]  They'd pay a corrupt cop to run them plates, get their address.
[01:46:32.547 --> 01:46:33.827]  They'd go and assassinate them.
[01:46:33.827 --> 01:46:36.449]  So this is just, this is before Facebook.
[01:46:36.449 --> 01:46:41.373]  This just goes to show what can happen when you just tell the world what it is that you're doing.
[01:46:41.373 --> 01:46:42.894]  And you don't even have to be doing anything wrong.
[01:46:42.894 --> 01:46:44.235]  You could just go on vacation and just
[01:46:44.415 --> 01:46:48.202]  And the globalists sell this idea, if you don't have anything to hide, what are you afraid of?
[01:46:48.202 --> 01:46:52.990]  Well, a tyrannical government, like Nazi Germany, will use that to suppress me.
[01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:54.412]  Criminals will use that.
[01:46:54.412 --> 01:46:56.355]  That's why privacy is so precious.
[01:46:56.355 --> 01:46:57.638]  It's why we have the Fourth Amendment.
[01:46:59.326 --> 01:47:01.908]  It's very scary, and these are rolling ideas.
[01:47:01.908 --> 01:47:16.316]  We need to confront them right on the head as soon as they come up with these ideas, like putting in the scanners and the microphones in the EU planes, and we need to debunk them for the ridiculous ideas that they are, and show why, even if there were terrorists out there trying to get on these planes, that it wouldn't even work anyway.
[01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:22.058]  What's going to happen when, if they put these scanners in these seaplanes and start listening to us and recording us?
[01:47:22.058 --> 01:47:28.040]  Somebody's going to have a conversation about the scanner themselves and then all those keywords are going to be starting to be detected.
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:35.042]  So, you're going to be sitting next to somebody and they're going to say, oh, there's the scanner looking for... Oh no, they admit that then goes in the data mining database.
[01:47:35.042 --> 01:47:36.863]  The government's keeping all of that.
[01:47:36.863 --> 01:47:39.184]  They're so used to listening to our phones and everything.
[01:47:39.184 --> 01:47:41.825]  Without warrants, they're like, okay, we're going to record you on the street.
[01:47:41.825 --> 01:47:43.405]  We're going to record you in the airplane.
[01:47:43.405 --> 01:47:44.966]  Mark, I've got four callers.
[01:47:46.306 --> 01:47:52.331]  I've got Damon, James, Tim, and Roger, because earlier I said call in.
[01:47:52.331 --> 01:47:54.953]  I'm going to hold you over to the next hour if you can do it.
[01:47:54.953 --> 01:47:59.716]  But I want to go to some of these calls right now on this issue of the mobile house scanners now.
[01:47:59.716 --> 01:48:09.264]  500 of these driving around without warrants and bathing people in what is considerably 10 times or higher than what a chest x-ray is.
[01:48:09.764 --> 01:48:13.605]  So let's go to Tim first, then Damon, James, and Roger.
[01:48:13.605 --> 01:48:18.566]  Tim is a former, he got laid off, TSA agent.
[01:48:18.566 --> 01:48:24.727]  Have they warned you guys about the backscatter radiation from the naked body scanners, Tim?
[01:48:24.727 --> 01:48:26.127]  Actually, no sir.
[01:48:26.127 --> 01:48:28.488]  I called in to tell you about how they laid me off.
[01:48:28.488 --> 01:48:30.808]  They were doing interviews.
[01:48:30.808 --> 01:48:34.349]  They were telling us that it was for advancement and more pay.
[01:48:34.349 --> 01:48:37.730]  And they actually gave us a questionnaire on the body scanners.
[01:48:39.367 --> 01:48:42.472]  I told them that I refused to work around them.
[01:48:42.472 --> 01:48:47.158]  They asked me if I was okay with people going through them and I said no.
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:56.942]  Oh, so they're going to find some idiots who will record people's naked bodies and violate child porn laws and be bathed in radiation?
[01:48:56.942 --> 01:48:57.842]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:57.842 --> 01:48:58.642]  I also have one question.
[01:48:58.642 --> 01:48:59.042]  Well, hold on.
[01:48:59.042 --> 01:48:59.903]  This is breaking news.
[01:48:59.903 --> 01:49:02.363]  Let me shut up because my brain moves so fast.
[01:49:02.363 --> 01:49:02.963]  Start over.
[01:49:02.963 --> 01:49:05.844]  Boy, I wish I could get a copy of that questionnaire.
[01:49:05.844 --> 01:49:13.926]  Have you heard how they want to make 11,000 TSA with security clearances so they can now give you disinfo but then not let you spread it?
[01:49:14.526 --> 01:49:18.790]  Actually, yes, we have heard about that too, about security clearances and levels and stuff like that.
[01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:19.791]  Okay, well let's go back then.
[01:49:19.791 --> 01:49:21.733]  When were you given this questionnaire?
[01:49:21.733 --> 01:49:24.776]  This was back on August 14th.
[01:49:24.776 --> 01:49:26.197]  Okay.
[01:49:26.197 --> 01:49:28.619]  And basically, it wasn't a questionnaire.
[01:49:28.619 --> 01:49:29.420]  It was like an interview.
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:31.342]  It was like being interviewed for a job or something.
[01:49:31.342 --> 01:49:33.003]  They took you into the office.
[01:49:33.003 --> 01:49:39.489]  We're just letting you know that we're reviewing you and it's for advancement and, you know, security clearance for higher pay.
[01:49:39.489 --> 01:49:40.170]  That type of thing.
[01:49:40.831 --> 01:49:46.175]  And they basically just look at the paper and go down the questions and you answer yes and why.
[01:49:46.175 --> 01:49:48.737]  What kind of questions?
[01:49:48.737 --> 01:49:55.422]  If you are okay with body scanning Americans.
[01:49:55.422 --> 01:50:03.048]  The other question was, was I willing to use the body scanners and stand near them and put people through them and stuff.
[01:50:04.282 --> 01:50:07.723]  And see, you're smart, but they're going to find morons that are willing to do it.
[01:50:07.723 --> 01:50:11.323]  I mean, they can find a certain percent that would shoot babies in the head if they were told to.
[01:50:11.323 --> 01:50:13.204]  Please continue.
[01:50:13.204 --> 01:50:22.885]  Basically, they just went down the questionnaire and said, OK, we'll let you know if you're getting promoted or whatever.
[01:50:22.885 --> 01:50:33.207]  And basically, 14 days after that happened, they basically told me that our professional relationship was at an end and they had no more work for me.
[01:50:33.914 --> 01:50:35.896]  I had a really quick question before you let me go.
[01:50:35.896 --> 01:50:37.036]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:50:37.036 --> 01:50:37.597]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:37.597 --> 01:50:43.141]  I want to come back to Tim, then Roger, Damon James, Mark Dice of The Resistance is our guest.
[01:50:43.141 --> 01:50:52.488]  All three of his great books, The New World Order, Facts and Fiction, The Illuminati, and of course The Resistance, the latest editions, are available at InfoWars.com.
[01:50:52.488 --> 01:50:54.209]  So support Mark and us when you get them.
[01:50:54.209 --> 01:50:55.189]  Plus, they're excellent.
[01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.530]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.953 --> 01:51:02.255]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.255 --> 01:51:07.842]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.842 --> 01:51:12.869]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.869 --> 01:51:13.349]  It's true.
[01:51:13.349 --> 01:51:17.915]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.436 --> 01:51:23.660]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:25.981]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.981 --> 01:51:30.784]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.784 --> 01:51:31.905]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.905 --> 01:51:34.967]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.967 --> 01:51:38.590]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:41.772]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.772 --> 01:51:44.013]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:49.997 --> 01:51:57.620]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:00.682]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:54:24.386 --> 01:54:26.227]  Okay, finishing up with Tim in Nevada.
[01:54:26.227 --> 01:54:27.868]  Mark will be with us about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:27.868 --> 01:54:32.109]  Then I'm getting into the economy, the internet, and a lot of other incredible information.
[01:54:32.109 --> 01:54:34.450]  What's happening with the political realignment.
[01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:35.231]  The Democrats are
[01:54:36.317 --> 01:54:38.919]  Cursing their electorate for not worshipping them.
[01:54:38.919 --> 01:54:42.160]  So we're going to be discussing that.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:47.143]  But Tim got laid off, basically fired from the TSA.
[01:54:47.143 --> 01:54:48.884]  That's big news if we could document this.
[01:54:48.884 --> 01:54:49.965]  I mean, I believe him.
[01:54:49.965 --> 01:54:51.346]  But that shows you how this works.
[01:54:51.346 --> 01:54:56.088]  Oh, you don't want to stand next to a radiation system without shielding.
[01:54:56.088 --> 01:54:56.909]  Oh, you're not an idiot.
[01:54:57.711 --> 01:55:02.213]  Sir, me and my wife are having a newborn baby and I'm so scared of all these vaccinations and stuff you guys talk about and I just wanted to know
[01:55:24.301 --> 01:55:35.204]  You know, I try to talk to my wife, and I try to make her listen to the show and stuff, and she really loves you, but... You know, the thing, she... You know, she's had, you know, a baby before, and, you know, I have kids from a previous marriage, and...
[01:55:36.427 --> 01:55:43.335]  I really just want to know what I can give my baby or if there's any website I can go to where it says exactly what.
[01:55:43.335 --> 01:55:50.783]  Well sir, I mean we've had Dr. Sherry Tenpenny on, we've had Dr. Russell Blaylock, top brain surgeon on about how deadly vaccines are.
[01:55:50.783 --> 01:55:53.105]  I have three children, they've never had a needle in them.
[01:55:53.105 --> 01:55:53.746]  Okay?
[01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:55.167]  So that'll give you an idea where I'm coming from.
[01:55:55.167 --> 01:55:56.248]  You make your own decision.
[01:55:56.829 --> 01:56:02.651]  If you're going to put the kid in a daycare with 50 kids jumping around, you know, who knows, they might actually get something.
[01:56:02.651 --> 01:56:07.433]  But if you look at the cost benefit analysis, vaccines clearly cause more problems than they help.
[01:56:07.433 --> 01:56:09.314]  Do I believe that you can get acquired immunity?
[01:56:09.314 --> 01:56:19.658]  I mean, I know the science of vaccines has some reality to it, but we I don't just get up here and say the globalists are poisoning vaccines because it sounds scary.
[01:56:19.658 --> 01:56:19.858]  I mean,
[01:56:20.678 --> 01:56:22.819]  It's all over InfoWars.com.
[01:56:22.819 --> 01:56:24.280]  It's all over PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:30.842]  Just search Rockefeller Foundation, you know, funded vaccines that sterilize.
[01:56:30.842 --> 01:56:39.506]  I mean, we've got a video that's two-part for sale at InfoWars.com by Dr. Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:56:39.506 --> 01:56:41.767]  In fact, I'll go over and link to it right now.
[01:56:41.767 --> 01:56:43.648]  Show that to your wife.
[01:56:43.648 --> 01:56:47.730]  We've got Dr. Eisenstein's Don't Vaccinate Before You Educate.
[01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:52.131]  Uh, book available at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:52.131 --> 01:56:56.773]  But I mean, almost all of this is just free, uh, on the internet already.
[01:56:56.773 --> 01:57:02.875]  Uh, I mean, just search this term, England suspends flu shot after increase in fits.
[01:57:02.875 --> 01:57:04.556]  And, and fits is the British name for...
[01:57:05.563 --> 01:57:07.023]  Convulsions.
[01:57:07.023 --> 01:57:10.384]  And it's a tenfold increase in convulsions.
[01:57:10.384 --> 01:57:13.485]  I mean, if you search InfoWars every day, you'll see this stuff everywhere.
[01:57:13.485 --> 01:57:16.365]  It's flu and flu vaccines.
[01:57:16.365 --> 01:57:18.906]  What's coming through the needle?
[01:57:18.906 --> 01:57:21.266]  Two-part DVD, InfoWars.com.
[01:57:21.266 --> 01:57:24.507]  I mean, does that sound like something that would help you?
[01:57:24.507 --> 01:57:24.987]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:24.987 --> 01:57:33.349]  The only thing is that when I come at her with those, she says that it's not a needle and it's some kind of liquid or something that they swallow or something.
[01:57:34.756 --> 01:57:50.896]  I mean all there is is the oral polio and you can search the term oral polio causes polio CBS News Tim if you want to write us a report about what happened to you but without using your name or if you just want to go public about it I think that would be a lot of courage
[01:57:51.457 --> 01:57:59.600]  You know, write a 5-10 paragraph article, we'll add research to it, and send it to showtipsatinfowars.com or writersatinfowars.com.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:05.883]  I'd like the news to get out that they're having internal purges within the NKVD TSA.
[01:58:05.883 --> 01:58:09.284]  God bless you, Tim.
[01:58:09.284 --> 01:58:18.468]  We're about to go to break, and I'm going to continue with calls, but I want to, we got Mark Dyson as a guest, but I want to hear from him, but briefly, what would you say to Tim, Mark, on the vaccines?
[01:58:19.824 --> 01:58:22.666]  You know, I don't... I haven't focused too much on the vaccines.
[01:58:22.666 --> 01:58:24.107]  That's a personal choice.
[01:58:24.107 --> 01:58:30.453]  I'm just kind of up to my neck in Big Brother and the secret societies, the police state.
[01:58:30.453 --> 01:58:33.895]  So, I would, you know... What was it?
[01:58:33.895 --> 01:58:35.356]  Jenny McCarthy?
[01:58:35.356 --> 01:58:36.137]  Jim Carrey?
[01:58:36.137 --> 01:58:37.518]  I've spoken out against them.
[01:58:37.518 --> 01:58:38.799]  There's a lot of other credible sources.
[01:58:38.799 --> 01:58:39.340]  Stay there!
[01:58:39.340 --> 01:58:48.267]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.876 --> 01:58:57.521]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:57.521 --> 01:59:02.665]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:02.665 --> 01:59:11.392]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.392 --> 01:59:15.455]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:15.455 --> 01:59:17.857]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:19.878 --> 01:59:24.480]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:28.321]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:59:28.321 --> 01:59:29.541]  Others don't.
[01:59:29.541 --> 01:59:31.682]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:59:31.682 --> 01:59:33.463]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:59:33.463 --> 01:59:36.364]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:36.364 --> 01:59:42.986]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:59:42.986 --> 01:59:45.687]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:45.687 --> 01:59:48.048]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:59:48.048 --> 01:59:48.548]  Others don't.
[01:59:53.553 --> 01:59:55.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.955 --> 02:00:05.440]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:06.741]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.741 --> 02:00:08.522]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.522 --> 02:00:10.283]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.283 --> 02:00:11.864]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.864 --> 02:00:13.425]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.425 --> 02:00:17.608]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.608 --> 02:00:21.670]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.496 --> 02:00:29.939]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:29.939 --> 02:00:31.180]  It is hour number three.
[02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:33.362]  Mark Dice is our guest.
[02:00:33.362 --> 02:00:47.675]  I want to hurry through these calls so we can finish up with Mark and some of the other things he's working on, but I told folks to call in with their concerns about the naked body scanners, the fact that the people running these are being exposed to high levels of radiation, and that's top scientist on record, New York Times, you name it.
[02:00:48.095 --> 02:00:50.275]  But they just come out and say that's just the way it is.
[02:00:50.275 --> 02:00:55.317]  Now blasting your homes with mobile vans and mobile checkpoints on the highway.
[02:00:55.317 --> 02:00:58.257]  Being reported today by WSB-TV.
[02:00:58.257 --> 02:01:01.878]  Counter-terror operation stops trucks on I-20, radiates them.
[02:01:01.878 --> 02:01:04.638]  Got a key report by Paul Watson.
[02:01:04.638 --> 02:01:07.439]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[02:01:07.439 --> 02:01:11.900]  So important to get this PrisonPlanet.com article out to everyone.
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:15.041]  Damon, in South Carolina, radiation therapist.
[02:01:15.041 --> 02:01:15.781]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:15.781 --> 02:01:16.341]  Tell us about it.
[02:01:16.963 --> 02:01:24.465]  Yeah, I'm a medical dosimetrist also, and I do treatment planning every day for cancer patients who get radiation.
[02:01:24.465 --> 02:01:31.227]  And part of my training, I had to take all sorts of radiation biology classes and learn about the current regs for it.
[02:01:31.227 --> 02:01:46.231]  And the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, they say that as a person who works with radiation, you're only supposed to get an annual dose of 50 millisieverts, okay?
[02:01:46.792 --> 02:01:58.562]  Which is, uh, Sievert is a measurement of both the radiation and then the biological effect of the radiation on what part of your body gets exposed, or the whole body for that matter.
[02:01:58.562 --> 02:02:11.732]  And then when you consider that these are people who work with radiation, and the, um, 3 Sievert, okay, has a 50% chance, uh, will kill 50% of all, um,
[02:02:14.194 --> 02:02:19.656]  50% of people who get received three fevers of dose will be dead within 30 days.
[02:02:19.656 --> 02:02:26.237]  So, I mean, that's how, I mean, dangerous this constant exposure to radiation is.
[02:02:26.237 --> 02:02:32.459]  And they admit the cell phones put off microwave radiation and it confirms, gives you brain tumors.
[02:02:32.459 --> 02:02:40.821]  This is really the globalist population reduction program is to just embed radiation-emitting devices everywhere and just kill us.
[02:02:40.821 --> 02:02:42.982]  We get exposed to radiation every day from the sun,
[02:02:43.442 --> 02:02:47.045]  From, you know, radon gas and other natural exposures.
[02:02:47.045 --> 02:02:49.026]  And that's the main reason we age.
[02:02:49.026 --> 02:02:54.390]  And that's why, on average, there's about 10 feet of water in the first 30,000 feet of atmosphere.
[02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:57.132]  You can't even breathe about after 17,000 feet.
[02:02:57.132 --> 02:03:01.054]  And that's why it's so dangerous for airline pilots and stewardesses.
[02:03:01.054 --> 02:03:05.177]  That's why they all basically, even if they're good looking, look like they've been put through a microwave.
[02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:11.682]  It's because they get the equivalent, what is it, every flight during broad daylight is the equivalent of a chest x-ray.
[02:03:12.671 --> 02:03:15.314]  Basically, but listen to this.
[02:03:15.314 --> 02:03:26.165]  The number I gave you for someone who works, occupational exposure, that's 50 millisieverts annually, but the public is only allowed to get one millisievert
[02:03:26.656 --> 02:03:27.857]  Okay.
[02:03:27.857 --> 02:03:29.857]  Five millisieverts annually, excuse me.
[02:03:29.857 --> 02:03:33.799]  And how many millisieverts are these naked body scanner technicians getting?
[02:03:33.799 --> 02:03:38.621]  Well, see, I've never gotten the specs on them, so I don't know what kind of energy they're using.
[02:03:38.621 --> 02:03:45.544]  Well, they lied and said that it was one amount, but then even the New York Times had to admit 20 to 50 times, depending on the machine.
[02:03:45.544 --> 02:03:48.905]  And then you've got these mobile scanners that are just off the charts.
[02:03:48.905 --> 02:03:53.107]  We've had an engineer slash radiologist designer on.
[02:03:53.107 --> 02:03:54.627]  They said at least 10 times.
[02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:55.828]  He knows the units.
[02:03:56.650 --> 02:04:00.273]  That they're using 10 times a chest x-ray.
[02:04:00.273 --> 02:04:03.035]  Oh, that's not... I mean, that's crazy high.
[02:04:03.035 --> 02:04:04.616]  When they die, though, they're going to love it.
[02:04:04.616 --> 02:04:05.597]  Here's the problem.
[02:04:05.597 --> 02:04:17.345]  If the public doesn't wear the badges, my co-workers and I, we all have to wear badges that get changed out every month that get a report done on them to say... There's not any badges and they don't have TSA wearing badges.
[02:04:17.345 --> 02:04:19.086]  And listen, remember the Pentagon.
[02:04:19.887 --> 02:04:25.229]  The Pentagon took over 4,000 children, this is on record, and radiated them to death.
[02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:27.909]  So they're just killing us.
[02:04:27.909 --> 02:04:31.330]  Sir, you ought to write a report for us and go pull up all the data.
[02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:33.931]  In fact, I want to get some official radiologists on.
[02:04:33.931 --> 02:04:35.012]  That's a prime thing.
[02:04:35.012 --> 02:04:37.592]  We'll get all the numbers on these and do an official report.
[02:04:39.853 --> 02:04:40.854]  Very interesting, Damon.
[02:04:40.854 --> 02:04:41.996]  You know what?
[02:04:41.996 --> 02:04:52.527]  I want Mark Dice to be able to finish up, because that's who we have on as a guest, but I want to put you on hold if you can do it towards the end of the hour to come back and finish up talking about this, okay?
[02:04:52.527 --> 02:04:52.888]  Absolutely.
[02:04:52.888 --> 02:04:54.910]  All right, Mark Dice is our guest.
[02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:55.731]  We're holding him into this now.
[02:04:55.731 --> 02:04:57.152]  We're going to sort of go into your calls.
[02:04:57.152 --> 02:04:59.055]  We'll get Mark's take on what Damon was just talking about.
[02:04:59.055 --> 02:04:59.855]  We'll go to James and Roger.
[02:05:00.396 --> 02:05:04.937]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.937 --> 02:05:05.858]  Number 1.
[02:05:05.858 --> 02:05:09.279]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.279 --> 02:05:10.139]  Number 2.
[02:05:10.139 --> 02:05:15.021]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.021 --> 02:05:15.781]  It's true.
[02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:20.642]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.642 --> 02:05:21.463]  Number 3.
[02:05:21.463 --> 02:05:25.044]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.044 --> 02:05:28.745]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:28.965 --> 02:05:29.765]  Number 4.
[02:05:29.765 --> 02:05:32.526]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.526 --> 02:05:36.208]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.208 --> 02:05:36.988]  Number 5.
[02:05:36.988 --> 02:05:41.130]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.130 --> 02:05:46.192]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.192 --> 02:05:50.373]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:52.317 --> 02:06:52.838]  Thank you!
[02:07:01.152 --> 02:07:05.156]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.156 --> 02:07:08.399]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.399 --> 02:07:13.564]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:07:13.564 --> 02:07:19.589]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:21.832]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.372 --> 02:07:22.672]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:22.672 --> 02:07:23.192]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.192 --> 02:07:23.973]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:23.973 --> 02:07:25.133]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:25.133 --> 02:07:27.374]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:43.121]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:07:43.121 --> 02:07:48.543]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:07:48.543 --> 02:07:57.667]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:05.734 --> 02:08:10.557]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.557 --> 02:08:12.138]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.138 --> 02:08:13.699]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.699 --> 02:08:17.881]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.881 --> 02:08:23.584]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.584 --> 02:08:30.909]  You know, I could, myself, just pull up... We can do it right now, guys.
[02:08:30.909 --> 02:08:32.970]  Just search the term.
[02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:33.610]  Top scientist.
[02:08:36.394 --> 02:08:44.105]  Top radiation scientist or radiation scientist says, uh, body scanners, serious cancer risk.
[02:08:44.105 --> 02:08:50.134]  Or headline, body scanners 20 times, uh, the radiation previously stated.
[02:08:50.134 --> 02:08:52.197]  Well, of course they lie and say they're not saving the image.
[02:08:53.434 --> 02:09:01.218]  Look, folks, they emit serious radiation, and you don't see the TSA wearing a lead apron, even.
[02:09:01.218 --> 02:09:02.119]  Okay?
[02:09:02.119 --> 02:09:03.760]  You don't see them wearing badges.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:04.960]  You know, my dad's a dentist.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.921]  They hide behind a lead wall.
[02:09:06.921 --> 02:09:11.964]  They've got a radiation officer that does it, that has to wear it.
[02:09:11.964 --> 02:09:13.885]  But notice, see, the globalists just don't care now.
[02:09:13.885 --> 02:09:17.567]  They come out and say, 20 years ago, Army said DEU would kill you deader than a hammer.
[02:09:17.567 --> 02:09:19.108]  One whiff of it would kill you a decade later.
[02:09:20.154 --> 02:09:28.221]  Now they just say, no problem, troops, snort it, roll around in it, don't even wash your hands, it's great.
[02:09:28.221 --> 02:09:32.785]  I mean, you know, 10 years ago, even five years ago, they would roll people's trucks through the border scanners.
[02:09:32.785 --> 02:09:34.486]  Now they have the families just go through them.
[02:09:34.486 --> 02:09:38.549]  It's just like the government's gone completely nuts.
[02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:41.232]  They're radiating you out in the open.
[02:09:41.232 --> 02:09:43.794]  Mark Dice, was that not a chilling call though?
[02:09:43.794 --> 02:09:47.157]  In fact, we just put the headline up, body scanners could give you cancer.
[02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:53.544]  Airport body scanners emit radiation up to 20 times more powerful than previously thought, as scientists have warned.
[02:09:53.544 --> 02:10:01.508]  And there's so many of these guys out there warning people, but... I mean, Mark... I'm speechless.
[02:10:01.508 --> 02:10:15.095]  We need a group of nurses and doctors, dentists, some sort of, some group in the medical establishment to come out and denounce these scanners, to denounce the body scanners at the airport, the mobile vans, because...
[02:10:15.916 --> 02:10:17.317]  You know, obviously this guy knows what he's talking about.
[02:10:17.317 --> 02:10:18.517]  He's in the field.
[02:10:18.517 --> 02:10:24.180]  The designers of these things don't even know, don't care, probably don't even think about these sort of repercussions.
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:25.501]  Doctors are so busy.
[02:10:25.501 --> 02:10:28.782]  Most people in the medical establishment work such long hours.
[02:10:28.782 --> 02:10:29.603]  They're not...
[02:10:31.563 --> 02:10:38.427]  But why are there radiology rules for everything else, but the government's got cops on top vehicles going, I love this!
[02:10:38.427 --> 02:10:40.368]  I can look right through walls!
[02:10:40.368 --> 02:10:45.492]  I mean, the thing is Death Star power compared to a pop gun.
[02:10:45.492 --> 02:10:47.313]  A regular x-ray is like nothing.
[02:10:47.313 --> 02:10:54.237]  This is like blasting power, and it's backscattering all over them, if you know about radiology.
[02:10:54.237 --> 02:10:56.058]  Look at Madame Curie, it killed her!
[02:10:56.058 --> 02:10:56.679]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:57.301 --> 02:10:58.262]  Oh, there's got to be a way.
[02:10:58.262 --> 02:11:07.049]  If there is some sort of, I know there's the recommended, you know, amount that once you exceed the, you know, a certain amount of radiation, it's going to be hazardous.
[02:11:07.049 --> 02:11:19.779]  So there's got to be some sort of a law or someone in a position of power and legal authority has got to be able to put forth some sort of a lawsuit in order to stop these, put a freeze to it, get this kind of information out.
[02:11:19.779 --> 02:11:24.623]  So, you know, if people like that caller that are aware of things like this, that are aware of your show,
[02:11:25.383 --> 02:11:27.064]  Well, Mark Dice expanding on that.
[02:11:27.064 --> 02:11:27.884]  The issue here is
[02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:52.911]  They are breaking the law because they run the system.
[02:11:52.911 --> 02:11:57.694]  In fact, guys, search the term, body scanners violate child porn laws.
[02:11:57.694 --> 02:11:59.856]  You'll get articles from the U.S.
[02:11:59.856 --> 02:12:00.636]  and from England.
[02:12:00.636 --> 02:12:11.143]  The one place they stood up in Denver, they had to stop x-raying, scanning 18 and under because the point was made this is illegal under state and federal law.
[02:12:11.923 --> 02:12:15.005]  So, they know it's illegal just on that front.
[02:12:15.005 --> 02:12:15.386]  There it is.
[02:12:15.386 --> 02:12:17.167]  New Scanners Break Child Porn Laws.
[02:12:17.167 --> 02:12:18.248]  London Guardian.
[02:12:18.248 --> 02:12:19.409]  They don't care.
[02:12:19.409 --> 02:12:20.890]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:31.557]  Have you seen these federal depositions of the Blackwater people with the running around naked, snorting giant amounts of cocaine and injecting drugs and smuggling armaments worldwide?
[02:12:31.557 --> 02:12:33.559]  I mean, there's just lunatics running things.
[02:12:34.659 --> 02:12:36.760]  Yeah, I mean, I've seen some of that.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:41.102]  Of course, there's been some interesting sex parties going on with some of the contractors.
[02:12:41.102 --> 02:12:46.424]  There's been allegations of women being raped, abused, all sorts of these things.
[02:12:46.424 --> 02:12:48.605]  Yeah, it's not that surprising.
[02:12:48.605 --> 02:12:53.227]  Again, turning back to Orwell here, it's as if there was hope.
[02:12:53.227 --> 02:12:55.608]  It lies with the proles, because
[02:12:56.452 --> 02:13:01.455]  They are, in those swarming disregarded masses, 85% of the population.
[02:13:01.455 --> 02:13:04.797]  And could the force to destroy the party ever be generated?
[02:13:04.797 --> 02:13:13.163]  But the polls, if not the proles rather, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire.
[02:13:13.163 --> 02:13:16.745]  If they would choose, they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning.
[02:13:17.537 --> 02:13:27.091]  But the party sits up there in fancy suits and plays the part of the liberal and the conservative, gives the proles the false paradigm and the proles stay within it.
[02:13:29.039 --> 02:13:51.966]  Yeah, I mean, we look at the snitch culture, the double-think, the relationships, the foreign countries painted as enemies, power-hungry officials, the erosion of the language, the overwhelming big brother, nanny state, the personification of the party, perpetuation of war, the control of information, the social hierarchy, it's all
[02:13:52.646 --> 02:13:53.246]  It was interesting.
[02:13:53.246 --> 02:13:56.088]  It's all predicted in George Orwell's book.
[02:13:56.088 --> 02:13:58.369]  And we're making tremendous progress.
[02:13:58.369 --> 02:14:04.431]  And like I said at the beginning of the show, you know, it's a microcosm and a macrocosm.
[02:14:04.431 --> 02:14:11.314]  You as an individual are bettering your life, and then together we will benefit society.
[02:14:11.314 --> 02:14:12.875]  You're absolutely right, Mark Dice.
[02:14:12.875 --> 02:14:20.138]  Let's talk to James in Texas, former military, about these mobile radiation trucks.
[02:14:20.138 --> 02:14:20.979]  Go ahead, James.
[02:14:22.076 --> 02:14:23.037]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:14:23.037 --> 02:14:26.720]  Pretty good.
[02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:28.541]  I've got something I wanted to say.
[02:14:28.541 --> 02:14:30.363]  I want to thank you for waking me up.
[02:14:30.363 --> 02:14:37.148]  I've been watching your show for about six months here, and I want to address a concern to your audience.
[02:14:37.148 --> 02:14:51.100]  These people that have woken up and they know what's going on with this globalist agenda, I want you to be aware that if you have woken up to the globalists, they have woken up to the fact that you are awake and you know
[02:14:56.011 --> 02:15:02.514]  That's right, and once you're in the fight, you're in it for life.
[02:15:02.514 --> 02:15:05.436]  But the big secret is we're already under attack.
[02:15:05.436 --> 02:15:11.539]  This is a global attack against every cop, every military, every housewife, every surgeon.
[02:15:11.539 --> 02:15:12.780]  We're all under this.
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:18.803]  This is a scientific, tiny elite doing this who are beyond evil and
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.183]  Folks must understand we are in a fight for our lives right now.
[02:15:24.183 --> 02:15:29.667]  Anything else that you want to comment on about the radiation scanners?
[02:15:29.667 --> 02:15:33.791]  About radiation, it doesn't have to do with the scanners, it has to do with the DU.
[02:15:33.791 --> 02:15:41.216]  I have problems with my urination track and I'm having problems too.
[02:15:41.216 --> 02:15:47.081]  I'm sterilized by a tetanus shot that I received in the army upon my discharge.
[02:15:47.557 --> 02:15:50.159]  Well, we've got the Rockefeller Foundation says they did it.
[02:15:50.159 --> 02:15:50.759]  It's public.
[02:15:50.759 --> 02:15:52.800]  And people call in saying, where is it?
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:58.243]  We've written like 15 articles or something on it with links to the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:15:58.243 --> 02:16:01.365]  And people don't even... I mean, are you mad that they did that to you?
[02:16:01.365 --> 02:16:05.688]  I mean, it's like the government assaults us and it's kind of like, well, that's the government.
[02:16:05.688 --> 02:16:14.253]  I am extremely angry because I know if they will do that to me, someone who wanted to... You know, I wanted to go and fight terrorists.
[02:16:14.253 --> 02:16:16.274]  When I found out there were none, I was kind of shocked.
[02:16:16.713 --> 02:16:27.823]  You know, and then when I found out they would do this to an American who would stand up for other Americans and willingly give his life for those people, and they would do that to me.
[02:16:28.615 --> 02:16:34.519]  You guys better believe that they will let you walk through a naked body scanner and they don't care if it gives you cancer.
[02:16:34.519 --> 02:16:36.500]  No, they want it to, but here's the deal.
[02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:38.982]  They know you joined because you're good.
[02:16:38.982 --> 02:16:44.065]  And they know they're destroying what you think you're defending when you're actually helping build their empire.
[02:16:44.065 --> 02:16:49.949]  So when they're done with you, they're going to hit you with soft kill vaccines and DU and the rest of it.
[02:16:50.169 --> 02:16:56.011]  to debilitate you down the road, and when you get upset about it, they're going to put you on a mentally ill list and come take your guns.
[02:16:56.011 --> 02:16:58.272]  What do you do with an old battleship?
[02:16:58.272 --> 02:16:59.753]  You blow it up and sink it.
[02:16:59.753 --> 02:17:00.813]  What do you do with an old cannon?
[02:17:00.813 --> 02:17:02.694]  You spike it.
[02:17:02.694 --> 02:17:04.355]  They're trying to spike you.
[02:17:04.355 --> 02:17:07.316]  But let me tell you something, brother, you're not spiked.
[02:17:07.316 --> 02:17:09.777]  Your spirit, your soul's there.
[02:17:09.777 --> 02:17:16.140]  It's hard to get rid of DU, but Dr. Doug Rocky, former head of the Army's radiology program, he could tell you what they did to him.
[02:17:17.259 --> 02:17:21.444]  And he watches them now, tell the troops, no problem with the DU.
[02:17:21.444 --> 02:17:23.025]  Let's get Doug Rocky back on.
[02:17:23.025 --> 02:17:26.729]  I mean, for anybody listening, cops, military, you better get it through your head.
[02:17:26.729 --> 02:17:29.612]  They want one group dead and hurt more than anybody else.
[02:17:29.612 --> 02:17:30.493]  That's you.
[02:17:30.493 --> 02:17:34.417]  When they're done with you, like an old tire, they want to burn you.
[02:17:34.417 --> 02:17:35.698]  I appreciate your call, James.
[02:17:35.698 --> 02:17:36.239]  Very touching.
[02:17:38.697 --> 02:17:40.418]  Closing comments, Mark Dice.
[02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:41.898]  It's been great having you on.
[02:17:41.898 --> 02:17:48.141]  You know, a year ago you went out with the gold coins and tried to give them to people for almost nothing and they wouldn't take them.
[02:17:48.141 --> 02:17:50.562]  Just showing what idiots they are.
[02:17:50.562 --> 02:18:02.547]  Yeah, you know, and then people said that they thought that the coin was fake, so then I went out and yeah, I tried to, instead of trying to sell it to them for $50, I offered it to them for free if they had any idea how much it was worth, and one woman guessed that just a few cents.
[02:18:03.323 --> 02:18:05.945]  A 38 cents, I believe, was her answer.
[02:18:05.945 --> 02:18:07.786]  Maybe the highest one was a few hundred dollars.
[02:18:07.786 --> 02:18:11.689]  So yeah, just try to be thankful that you're on the right path.
[02:18:11.689 --> 02:18:17.192]  People listening to this show, people that are aware, you know, you can become more aware once you find out the system.
[02:18:17.192 --> 02:18:28.420]  And if we don't, the consequences are horrific, as the main bad guy in 1984 says, quote, never again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:30.141]  Everything will be dead inside of you.
[02:18:30.761 --> 02:18:38.007]  Never again will you be capable of love, or friendship, or joy of living, or laughter, or curiosity, or courage, or integrity.
[02:18:38.007 --> 02:18:39.548]  You will be hollow.
[02:18:39.548 --> 02:18:44.673]  We shall squeeze you empty, and then we shall fill you with ourselves.
[02:18:44.673 --> 02:18:52.419]  So, I just say, as Orwell concluded his book, down with Big Brother.
[02:18:52.419 --> 02:18:54.441]  Well, that's spoken like a true terrorist!
[02:18:56.158 --> 02:19:01.962]  Yeah, and the fascinating thing is once we can get our numbers up enough, we can become the norm.
[02:19:01.962 --> 02:19:03.603]  I mean, look what we've done for 9-11 Truth.
[02:19:03.603 --> 02:19:20.995]  It went from being virtually unknown, to being an internet conspiracy theory, to spilling over into the mainstream with a few Hollywood people, to now, and we have world leaders around the world, and Germany, and England, and everywhere is just right on board with us.
[02:19:20.995 --> 02:19:24.757]  So, if we can just get the word out about their Big Brother system, their nanny state,
[02:19:26.838 --> 02:19:33.243]  Well, yeah, I agree with you.
[02:19:33.243 --> 02:19:38.826]  But also, just getting people to realize there is evil in the world, and it's running the government.
[02:19:38.826 --> 02:19:41.008]  I mean, people have got to really get it to their head.
[02:19:41.008 --> 02:19:44.290]  They don't just care if the radiation hurts you or don't care.
[02:19:44.290 --> 02:19:45.331]  They want to hurt you.
[02:19:46.479 --> 02:19:50.021]  Yeah, they're inhuman, inhuman social Darwinists.
[02:19:50.021 --> 02:19:56.764]  And so, you know, hijack the Culture Jam, the social network site, you know, use it, use the system against the system to crack it open.
[02:19:56.764 --> 02:19:57.364]  Absolutely.
[02:19:57.364 --> 02:19:58.485]  Great job, Mark Dice.
[02:20:01.707 --> 02:20:06.028]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[02:20:06.028 --> 02:20:11.510]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety for your family?

[02:21:00.419 --> 02:21:02.821]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:05.023]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:21:05.023 --> 02:21:08.345]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:21:08.345 --> 02:21:13.450]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:13.450 --> 02:21:17.653]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:17.953 --> 02:21:20.296]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:20.296 --> 02:21:23.180]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:26.104]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:26.104 --> 02:21:33.714]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:34.031 --> 02:21:39.413]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:39.413 --> 02:21:42.274]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:42.274 --> 02:21:45.955]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:45.955 --> 02:21:47.016]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:47.016 --> 02:21:48.356]  You're everyone else.
[02:21:48.356 --> 02:21:49.857]  Invisible Empire.

[02:22:00.305 --> 02:22:01.325]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:01.325 --> 02:22:06.848]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:06.848 --> 02:22:07.408]  I get it.
[02:22:07.408 --> 02:22:17.012]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:17.012 --> 02:22:18.173]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:18.433 --> 02:22:26.897]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:22:26.897 --> 02:22:30.279]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:30.279 --> 02:22:34.561]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:34.561 --> 02:22:36.161]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:36.161 --> 02:22:39.563]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:39.563 --> 02:22:43.725]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:43.925 --> 02:22:44.826]  You should, too.
[02:22:44.826 --> 02:22:45.968]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:45.968 --> 02:22:49.353]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.

[02:22:49.613 --> 02:22:49.693]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:49.693 --> 02:22:49.873]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:59.747 --> 02:23:01.368]  Buy the case or buy the pallet.

[02:24:04.673 --> 02:24:17.561]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[02:24:17.561 --> 02:24:23.464]  But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool.
[02:24:28.212 --> 02:24:34.579]  Folks, you need to get the same desperate spirit of resistance that I've got.
[02:24:34.579 --> 02:24:36.441]  You need to realize this is real.
[02:24:36.441 --> 02:24:38.102]  This is really happening.
[02:24:38.102 --> 02:24:39.464]  Mark Dice was talking about
[02:24:40.609 --> 02:24:43.290]  People coming up to him and saying, are you for real?
[02:24:43.290 --> 02:24:44.471]  Do you really mean this?
[02:24:44.471 --> 02:24:47.192]  Every time I'm on an airplane, people ask me that.
[02:24:47.192 --> 02:24:54.016]  I have troops come up to me when I was with Jesse Ventura flying around the country and asking us both if we really meant what we were talking about.
[02:24:54.016 --> 02:25:02.280]  Of course I mean what I'm talking about, but it's 90 plus percent of what we cover, probably 95 or more, is open source.
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:03.281]  It's there.
[02:25:03.281 --> 02:25:05.862]  It's there.
[02:25:05.862 --> 02:25:07.063]  Do you think I'd get on the air
[02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:25.150]  Ten years ago, when gold was $265 an ounce, and say, I think you should buy gold and silver because they've passed the derivatives law and they're going to deflate the value of the dollar, and historically, 100% of the time, metals go up.
[02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:29.311]  I mean, I sleep good at night, folks.
[02:25:29.311 --> 02:25:30.951]  I feel good about what I do.
[02:25:30.951 --> 02:25:32.251]  I believe what I'm saying.
[02:25:32.251 --> 02:25:34.292]  But I don't just believe it, I know it!
[02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:35.372]  I've got the Pentagon!
[02:25:36.738 --> 02:25:43.222]  And the National Security Council saying they're setting up a collectivist world government.
[02:25:43.222 --> 02:25:44.262]  It's real, okay?
[02:25:44.262 --> 02:25:47.644]  It's real, real, real, real, real, real, real.
[02:25:47.644 --> 02:25:52.207]  And I just want my children to have a future.
[02:25:52.207 --> 02:25:53.267]  I want to beat these people.
[02:25:53.267 --> 02:25:54.568]  They're so horrible.
[02:25:54.568 --> 02:25:56.949]  And they win because they're so ruthless.
[02:25:56.949 --> 02:26:02.392]  The average person cannot believe they're this evil.
[02:26:02.392 --> 02:26:03.093]  Oh, heaven help me.
[02:26:06.209 --> 02:26:10.052]  I want to go back to fear calls and the radiologist.
[02:26:10.052 --> 02:26:12.494]  My biggest frustration is I can't do it all.
[02:26:12.494 --> 02:26:18.839]  I can't warn everybody and I've got to spend my time on petty things like making sure the internet works or taking the trash out.
[02:26:18.839 --> 02:26:19.579]  I'm not complaining.
[02:26:19.579 --> 02:26:22.121]  It's just I've got so much work I want to do.
[02:26:22.121 --> 02:26:22.982]  So many things.
[02:26:22.982 --> 02:26:24.003]  So many things.
[02:26:24.003 --> 02:26:26.485]  We've got to stop these people.
[02:26:26.485 --> 02:26:30.387]  We've got to go to the next level in the fight against them.
[02:26:30.387 --> 02:26:34.471]  And I appreciate everybody supporting our sponsors and our operation because we wouldn't be here without you.
[02:26:35.649 --> 02:26:41.940]  I need you and everybody listening to become your own leaders in your own area and just wake up one person a week!
[02:26:41.940 --> 02:26:44.225]  That'll bring down the globalists!
[02:26:44.225 --> 02:26:48.172]  But that poor caller who's been sterilized in the military and the DU...
[02:26:49.923 --> 02:26:56.125]  You know, he said, yeah, if they didn't care about me, they don't care about you going through a body scanner.
[02:26:56.125 --> 02:26:57.306]  And he's wrong.
[02:26:57.306 --> 02:26:58.826]  See, the poor guy, he's a great guy.
[02:26:58.826 --> 02:27:01.347]  He can't even get it through his head.
[02:27:01.347 --> 02:27:02.868]  It's not that they don't care.
[02:27:02.868 --> 02:27:03.948]  They do care.
[02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:06.049]  They care about hurting you.
[02:27:06.049 --> 02:27:06.850]  They love it.
[02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:11.171]  It's their whole stinking goal.
[02:27:11.171 --> 02:27:12.532]  Shifting gears into the economy.
[02:27:16.081 --> 02:27:23.064]  Anti-austerity protests sweep across Europe as they raise taxes and cut pensions and just totally rob everybody to give all the money to the banks.
[02:27:23.064 --> 02:27:26.246]  Gold stayed up above $1,307 today.
[02:27:26.246 --> 02:27:30.848]  World gripped by international currency war that's ongoing.
[02:27:30.848 --> 02:27:36.430]  Bank of England deputy Charlie Dean says spend to save the economy means give them more money.
[02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:37.851]  Gold to go.
[02:27:37.851 --> 02:27:40.052]  Taps into gold fever with gold ATMs.
[02:27:42.873 --> 02:27:44.874]  And I've got all these news about gold exploding.
[02:27:44.874 --> 02:27:48.977]  I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up because he's the owner of this network.
[02:27:48.977 --> 02:27:50.578]  He's the guy that made so much of this possible.
[02:27:50.578 --> 02:27:55.142]  And he's got gold and silver at the lowest prices I've ever seen it anywhere in this market.
[02:27:55.142 --> 02:27:58.004]  And Ted wears gold right now.
[02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:02.498]  Well, gold currently right now is trading at $1310.40.
[02:28:02.498 --> 02:28:05.260]  It's seen a high today of $1313.20.
[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.601]  Silver went over $22 an ounce today.
[02:28:07.601 --> 02:28:09.983]  That's a high that it hasn't seen for over 30 years.
[02:28:09.983 --> 02:28:12.484]  It's been a big day for silver.
[02:28:12.484 --> 02:28:13.465]  Unbelievable!
[02:28:15.595 --> 02:28:20.922]  Tell us the gold and silver you've got, because again, you keep selling out of what you bought two months ago, a month ago, three weeks ago.
[02:28:20.922 --> 02:28:24.566]  You've still got gold and silver in the market lower than it currently is.
[02:28:24.566 --> 02:28:26.629]  That's how you can have such good deals.
[02:28:26.629 --> 02:28:28.291]  What do you have in the silver half dollars?
[02:28:28.291 --> 02:28:29.072]  What do you got in gold?
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:32.182]  Well, I'm still holding that silver half-dollar price.
[02:28:32.182 --> 02:28:40.028]  I don't know how long I can anymore now, but that $10.50 or $210 per roll of 20 is not going to be seen.
[02:28:40.028 --> 02:28:46.193]  I know that my market prices on the internet have gone over $12, and just, you know, the
[02:28:47.034 --> 02:28:51.096]  The small amount of inventory that I have left, I don't think I'm going to be able to do it for much longer.
[02:28:51.096 --> 02:28:55.799]  $2.83 on Franks, I know those have already gone up to $2.88.
[02:28:55.799 --> 02:28:58.741]  $3.55, $2.22 on British Sovereigns, they're more like $3.58.
[02:28:58.741 --> 02:29:04.644]  I mean, just the whole market is going upward and, you know, it's just one of those things.
[02:29:04.644 --> 02:29:06.125]  The U.S.
[02:29:06.125 --> 02:29:07.606]  Eagles right now aren't a great buy.
[02:29:07.606 --> 02:29:09.747]  You know, if you can pick up those under $1,300, under $1,400 an ounce now.
[02:29:09.747 --> 02:29:10.928]  I mean, everything is just, you know...
[02:29:15.730 --> 02:29:20.814]  Alex, it's just amazing to me how cyclical the gold prices are.
[02:29:20.814 --> 02:29:25.177]  I mean, we're heading into October, and that's when we're going to see our highs.
[02:29:25.177 --> 02:29:30.301]  It's just amazing where we're at here.
[02:29:30.301 --> 02:29:31.742]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:31.742 --> 02:29:32.222]  800-686-2237.
[02:29:32.222 --> 02:29:37.906]  I want to come back into some more economic news briefly with you, Ted, then we're going to go to phone calls and a bunch of other news.
[02:29:37.906 --> 02:29:41.349]  But when I tell the listeners, my head is spinning.
[02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:43.911]  I mean, it's just all moving so fast right now.
[02:29:45.086 --> 02:29:48.029]  And I hope people protect themselves financially with gold and silver.
[02:29:48.029 --> 02:29:51.273]  These are great deals.
[02:29:51.273 --> 02:29:52.674]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.674 --> 02:29:55.197]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.197 --> 02:29:57.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.475 --> 02:30:03.617]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:30:03.617 --> 02:30:07.400]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:10.282]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:30:10.282 --> 02:30:15.206]  You need to get your own supply of high quality storable foods from efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:15.666 --> 02:30:21.589]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great food to choose from.
[02:30:21.589 --> 02:30:27.272]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[02:30:27.272 --> 02:30:31.815]  Try their new Evacuation Pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[02:30:31.815 --> 02:30:39.919]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on Iran in the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[02:30:40.279 --> 02:30:42.500]  Get yourself and your family ready today.
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:44.881]  The place to go is efoodsdirect.com.
[02:30:44.881 --> 02:30:52.704]  Go to their website online right now, efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.

[02:31:02.427 --> 02:31:04.591]  You're subject to other police action.
[02:31:04.591 --> 02:31:05.873]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:05.873 --> 02:31:09.578]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.578 --> 02:31:12.042]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.042 --> 02:31:17.090]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.891 --> 02:31:24.555]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.555 --> 02:31:30.538]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.538 --> 02:31:34.240]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.700 --> 02:31:39.002]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.002 --> 02:31:44.946]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:44.946 --> 02:31:48.507]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.507 --> 02:31:50.469]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:51.609]  It's here.

[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:04.452]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.452 --> 02:32:10.876]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calbin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.876 --> 02:32:18.260]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:22.803]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:32:23.123 --> 02:32:31.786]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:32:31.786 --> 02:32:36.047]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:32:36.047 --> 02:32:42.209]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:32:42.829 --> 02:32:46.691]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.691 --> 02:32:59.037]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.
[02:32:59.037 --> 02:33:02.778]  Thank you.
[02:33:02.778 --> 02:33:04.479]  Big Brother.
[02:33:04.479 --> 02:33:05.620]  Mainstream Media.
[02:33:06.818 --> 02:33:08.582]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:08.582 --> 02:33:10.686]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:10.686 --> 02:33:12.811]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:12.811 --> 02:33:17.520]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.348 --> 02:33:45.001]  This issue of them bathing TSA workers and then Homeland Security workers with these super high power x-rays on the highways and our homes, that they would do it knowing it's dangerous, knowing it's going to hurt people, especially the idiots that are operating these.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:47.960]  It's just outside of federal law.
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:57.283]  There's federal law and international law on x-rays, and people that work as radiologists throughout their lives have way higher cancers.
[02:33:57.283 --> 02:34:01.485]  That's not denied, and this stuff is way off the charts compared to that.
[02:34:01.485 --> 02:34:08.407]  That's why we have this article, Feds Radiating Americans at Internal Checkpoints at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:08.407 --> 02:34:10.027]  This article has got to get out to everyone.
[02:34:10.027 --> 02:34:14.209]  Send it to your doctors, especially nurses, because Mark Dice is right.
[02:34:14.209 --> 02:34:15.109]  We need a movement.
[02:34:15.796 --> 02:34:23.303]  But we have architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, you know, medical people, radiologists against body scanners.
[02:34:23.303 --> 02:34:24.243]  It's so incredible.
[02:34:24.243 --> 02:34:28.267]  And the search term today, I hope people will keep entering this in to keep it up there.
[02:34:28.267 --> 02:34:29.208]  Hopefully it'll hit number one.
[02:34:29.208 --> 02:34:29.868]  I'm sure it will.
[02:34:30.919 --> 02:34:32.701]  Feds radiating Americans.
[02:34:32.701 --> 02:34:35.043]  Please put that into Google over and over again.
[02:34:35.043 --> 02:34:37.024]  Feds radiating Americans.
[02:34:37.024 --> 02:34:39.706]  So the top link will be our article.
[02:34:39.706 --> 02:34:41.788]  So hundreds of thousands additional will see it.
[02:34:41.788 --> 02:34:45.151]  This is the type of report that the Drudge Report tends to link to as well.
[02:34:45.151 --> 02:34:49.495]  They linked to one of our stories yesterday about Obama can shut down private companies.
[02:34:50.945 --> 02:34:51.105]  It is.
[02:34:51.105 --> 02:34:52.325]  I mean, we hit that just a little bit a while ago.
[02:34:52.325 --> 02:34:53.166]  So silver has hit its all-time high?
[02:35:16.613 --> 02:35:17.495]  With the exception of 1980.
[02:35:17.495 --> 02:35:18.538]  Silver hit $50 an ounce in 1980.
[02:35:18.538 --> 02:35:20.122]  It's a high that's never been seen within the last 30 years.
[02:35:25.976 --> 02:35:28.598]  So we're still not at the peak with silver yet.
[02:35:28.598 --> 02:35:33.901]  When the Hunt brothers were pushing silver up in 1980, they pushed it over $50 an ounce.
[02:35:33.901 --> 02:35:36.483]  And then it dropped down to about $3 an ounce.
[02:35:36.483 --> 02:35:45.508]  And I've got all these reports with all these top analysts and former Bush administration top economists saying we're in a depression, total implosion.
[02:35:45.508 --> 02:35:48.070]  You've got all the economic numbers coming out.
[02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:53.993]  Paper money and derivatives are not worth the paper they're printed on.
[02:35:55.114 --> 02:36:01.456]  Folks need to move into gold and silver, and I cannot think of a better place to start than with those silver half dollars at $10.50.
[02:36:01.456 --> 02:36:06.077]  I mean, they're $16 a lot of places, $12 everywhere else.
[02:36:06.077 --> 02:36:10.178]  That's a dollar and a half under any... I mean, you cannot find them at $10.50, folks.
[02:36:10.178 --> 02:36:10.978]  I challenge you.
[02:36:10.978 --> 02:36:13.339]  And Ted's got bags of them, but he's running out.
[02:36:13.339 --> 02:36:19.020]  And then you've got the Franks, you've got the Sovereigns, you ran out of the Buffalos, you've got the Eagles at a great price.
[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:19.501]  $800, $686, $2237, Ted.
[02:36:19.501 --> 02:36:20.861]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:36:24.662 --> 02:36:33.870]  Well, just pay attention to what's going on in the economy and take a real serious look at your traditional investments because I think they're going to be in trouble.
[02:36:33.870 --> 02:36:40.496]  Well, Ted, what does this mean for Bloomberg reporting a month ago that the majority of the futures in
[02:36:42.677 --> 02:36:44.178]  In December, or at $1,500.
[02:36:44.178 --> 02:36:46.900]  I mean, do you think it could really go that high?
[02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:48.681]  Well, actually, yeah.
[02:36:48.681 --> 02:37:02.469]  I think it could easily hit $1,500 an ounce, and I don't think people will be too surprised when it gets there, considering the fact that we're already at $1,300 an ounce now, and to go another $200 is really just what happened the last few years, you know?
[02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:08.812]  We've seen these $200 increases in the fall almost four years in a row, so why wouldn't it happen this time?
[02:37:08.812 --> 02:37:09.853]  You know, we're here.
[02:37:10.773 --> 02:37:12.915]  We're knocking on the door of $1,500.
[02:37:12.915 --> 02:37:14.997]  Okay, maybe it might hit $1,490.
[02:37:14.997 --> 02:37:15.637]  But you know what?
[02:37:15.637 --> 02:37:17.619]  It's heading upward.
[02:37:17.619 --> 02:37:19.841]  It's September, October, November, December.
[02:37:19.841 --> 02:37:22.883]  There have always been better months than September in the gold market.
[02:37:22.883 --> 02:37:25.265]  Yeah, and I don't buy gold and silver as an investment.
[02:37:25.265 --> 02:37:28.928]  I buy it as a hedge against inflation and depression.
[02:37:28.928 --> 02:37:34.413]  But now, more and more people, it is for investment because it's trading at four times what it was just a decade ago.
[02:37:34.810 --> 02:37:39.653]  Well, Alex, I mean, just simple as this, it's so much better than holding on to fiat currency.
[02:37:39.653 --> 02:37:49.280]  When you know that our government is sitting on a printing press and they can turn it on at any speed they want to, and anytime they turn it on it's going to devaluate what we have, what do you think is going to happen in the future?
[02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:56.484]  Well, that's one of the headlines today, is that the world is in horror as the Federal Reserve turns the printing presses on high.
[02:37:56.484 --> 02:38:01.728]  I mean, they are just flooding things, but it's not even getting to the public, they're flooding it to the banks.
[02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:05.344]  Yeah, that's because there's not enough credit-worthy borrowers out there.
[02:38:05.344 --> 02:38:07.748]  The banks are just buying, you know, they're playing it safe.
[02:38:07.748 --> 02:38:08.469]  They're buying U.S.
[02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:10.172]  government securities.
[02:38:10.172 --> 02:38:11.514]  But, you know, I mean, come on.
[02:38:11.514 --> 02:38:17.644]  You can't just keep... So their so-called bailout and stimulus is just giving more money to the banks that engineered the implosion?
[02:38:18.064 --> 02:38:23.589]  It does, and it gives them great big fat profits that come directly out of taxation from us.
[02:38:23.589 --> 02:38:24.730]  We the people, the United States.
[02:38:24.730 --> 02:38:28.073]  And that's why worldwide they're raising taxes everywhere and calling it austerity.
[02:38:28.073 --> 02:38:29.013]  Here's a headline.
[02:38:29.013 --> 02:38:31.556]  Gold price could hit $4,000, says Paulson.
[02:38:31.556 --> 02:38:33.597]  The gold price headed to over $1,313.
[02:38:33.597 --> 02:38:34.178]  On Monday it was $1,295.
[02:38:34.178 --> 02:38:35.379]  The price of gold, all-time high, finished higher.
[02:38:42.865 --> 02:38:43.025]  I think?
[02:39:03.140 --> 02:39:11.886]  And that's John Paulson, the hedge fund magnate who rose to fame after shorting securities tied to the housing market prior to the financial crisis of 2008.
[02:39:11.886 --> 02:39:13.287]  That's what he's doing.
[02:39:14.574 --> 02:39:15.414]  Yeah, you're right about that.
[02:39:15.414 --> 02:39:18.875]  And, you know, just take a look at the dollar index right now.
[02:39:18.875 --> 02:39:19.436]  It's slipping.
[02:39:19.436 --> 02:39:22.576]  There's so many foreign nations right now that are looking at the U.S.
[02:39:22.576 --> 02:39:24.597]  dollar as being doomed.
[02:39:24.597 --> 02:39:27.318]  I mean, it's just, it's sad, but that's the way that it is.
[02:39:27.318 --> 02:39:34.380]  We're losing our economic power status, and we're slipping into this second world nation, you know, thing.
[02:39:34.380 --> 02:39:37.901]  And it just, it's sad that we've let it happen.
[02:39:37.901 --> 02:39:40.042]  We shouldn't be taking it down this road, but you know what?
[02:39:40.042 --> 02:39:43.103]  The United States is doing it, and the people of the United States have to...
[02:39:44.303 --> 02:39:49.325]  I mean, no parachute is perfect, but the gold and silver really are the parachute.
[02:39:49.325 --> 02:39:53.806]  And it's better to jump out with a parachute if it's about to crash than with no parachute.
[02:39:53.806 --> 02:39:55.706]  And we just hope the chute's been packed correctly.
[02:39:55.706 --> 02:39:56.687]  Here's Bloomberg.
[02:39:56.687 --> 02:40:00.568]  Dollar trades near five-month low before U.S.
[02:40:00.568 --> 02:40:01.868]  housing sentiment reports.
[02:40:01.868 --> 02:40:03.028]  I mean, there it is right there.
[02:40:03.028 --> 02:40:04.649]  The dollar is just tumbling right now.
[02:40:05.956 --> 02:40:07.236]  Yep, it is.
[02:40:07.236 --> 02:40:08.357]  And what would you rather have?
[02:40:08.357 --> 02:40:23.202]  If you're sitting there with money in the savings account, would you rather have that money positioned in gold and silver, which has a 6,000 year track record of being money, or would you rather have this fiat currency that's only been separated from gold since 1971?
[02:40:25.183 --> 02:40:30.247]  I mean, seriously, in 1971, you could have purchased a home for about $24,000.
[02:40:30.247 --> 02:40:34.209]  You could have purchased a car for $1,500.
[02:40:34.209 --> 02:40:38.212]  A gallon of gasoline for $0.24.
[02:40:38.212 --> 02:40:40.774]  Where do you think the dollar is going to go from here?
[02:40:40.774 --> 02:40:48.540]  You just can't afford to stay into fiat money and its instruments like annuities, stocks, bonds.
[02:40:48.540 --> 02:40:51.682]  I mean, all the paper investments that you can think of.
[02:40:52.122 --> 02:40:57.325]  I mean, at least diversify your portfolio, maybe a minimum of 20% at this time.
[02:40:57.325 --> 02:41:00.306]  I mean, the earthquake is happening.
[02:41:00.306 --> 02:41:01.767]  The storm is coming.
[02:41:01.767 --> 02:41:03.588]  I mean, batten down the hatches.
[02:41:03.588 --> 02:41:04.668]  Get some gold and silver.
[02:41:04.668 --> 02:41:07.770]  Well, the storm's already here, but it's the leading edge.
[02:41:07.770 --> 02:41:09.931]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:09.931 --> 02:41:11.371]  Folks, I believe these are great deals.
[02:41:11.371 --> 02:41:12.552]  I know they're great deals.
[02:41:12.552 --> 02:41:15.113]  And I think this is a great place to start investing in gold and silver.
[02:41:15.113 --> 02:41:16.434]  Have you already bought over the years?
[02:41:17.294 --> 02:41:20.417]  You know, when Gold was 800 an ounce, it looked like a lot to pay for it.
[02:41:20.417 --> 02:41:22.479]  Now it looks like nothing at all.
[02:41:22.479 --> 02:41:26.663]  Imagine if it does hit $1,500, $2,000, $4,000 down the road.
[02:41:26.663 --> 02:41:27.824]  I mean, this is serious.
[02:41:27.824 --> 02:41:28.225]  800-686-2237.
[02:41:28.225 --> 02:41:34.310]  Tell them it's the radio special to get the lowest prices available anywhere I've seen.
[02:41:34.310 --> 02:41:34.871]  Ted, thank you.
[02:41:35.231 --> 02:41:36.252]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:41:36.252 --> 02:41:36.832]  You bet.
[02:41:36.832 --> 02:41:40.114]  I want to go to Roger, ex-military, wants to comment on radiation DU.
[02:41:40.114 --> 02:41:45.378]  Then we're going to finish up with Damon, who's a radiologist, a radiation therapist.
[02:41:45.378 --> 02:41:49.860]  But let's go back to, well, let's have Roger speak, who's been holding.
[02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:50.781]  Thanks for holding, Roger.
[02:41:50.781 --> 02:41:52.722]  What's on your mind?
[02:41:52.722 --> 02:41:55.864]  Yeah, you was talking about the radiation.
[02:41:55.864 --> 02:41:56.425]  Yes.
[02:41:56.425 --> 02:42:00.147]  Well, I'm ex-military, and I got to tell you, when you're in the military,
[02:42:01.668 --> 02:42:07.271]  You get to watch mainstream news, like when you're in the barracks and stuff like that, but that's really all you get.
[02:42:07.271 --> 02:42:14.495]  Most of the time, you're not even watching any TV, and if you're on active duty all the time, that's all you get.
[02:42:14.495 --> 02:42:24.241]  Well, the only people that actually get to really listen to your program and stuff like that are those of us that are in and out, in and out.
[02:42:24.241 --> 02:42:25.461]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:42:25.461 --> 02:42:25.661]  Yes.
[02:42:31.085 --> 02:42:39.408]  Uh, an E5 and because of the unit I was in, um, you know, I had top secret clearance on a couple things.
[02:42:39.408 --> 02:42:50.732]  And, um, and one of the things that has happened is, is, you know, I've been, you know, I'm out now and, and, um, I got medical problems and it's all because of the military.
[02:42:50.732 --> 02:42:53.853]  I got a catheterized myself four to six times a day.
[02:42:55.700 --> 02:43:04.926]  You know, that doesn't happen all the time, but I have to do that probably within a month, maybe two, three times where it would last, you know, like up to three days to get things working again.
[02:43:04.926 --> 02:43:15.072]  And it's just like you heard, and you even made a comment about how the military and Obama was saying that how we would have to buy our own insurance, but then they backed off of that.
[02:43:15.072 --> 02:43:18.094]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:43:18.094 --> 02:43:21.816]  Even though my stuff is combat related,
[02:43:22.952 --> 02:43:34.159]  The only way, I'm at 80% disability, and the only way I can get 100% disability is if I would claim to be PTSD, and I'm not doing that.
[02:43:34.159 --> 02:43:40.663]  Yeah, you can have your legs blown off and not get taken care of, but if you'll say you're mentally ill, then they can take your Second Amendment away.
[02:43:40.663 --> 02:43:43.125]  Yeah, exactly, the right to carry arms.
[02:43:43.567 --> 02:43:45.087]  But they don't tell you that.
[02:43:45.087 --> 02:43:54.850]  Well, I said no, so I had to go and buy medical insurance to help cover my medical expenses even though I go to the VA.
[02:43:54.850 --> 02:43:56.630]  Which is ridiculous.
[02:43:56.630 --> 02:44:05.013]  I mean, my medicine bill every three months was like over $10,000 just for my pills.
[02:44:05.013 --> 02:44:05.813]  That's my pills.
[02:44:05.813 --> 02:44:07.093]  What do you think got you?
[02:44:07.093 --> 02:44:09.854]  DU, the vaccines?
[02:44:09.854 --> 02:44:10.354]  Uh, both.
[02:44:11.187 --> 02:44:16.149]  And I'll tell you something else about the DU, the depleted uranium.
[02:44:16.149 --> 02:44:24.233]  Those ammo boxes, because I had to work to help the supply sergeant, because he was down, so I went in and helped.
[02:44:24.233 --> 02:44:32.937]  It's marked on the wood crates that the ammo boxes come in, but it's not marked on the ammo boxes, so the soldiers don't know what they're getting.
[02:44:33.949 --> 02:44:45.799]  And, and, you know, we wear gloves, but the thing about it is, is it's awkward loading your magazines and things like that with gloves, so you take your gloves off to load it, so you don't know what you're actually getting.
[02:44:45.799 --> 02:44:46.700]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:53.686]  And worse than that, once a .50 cal round or a Abram Sabo goes into something, it aerosolizes.
[02:44:53.686 --> 02:44:57.229]  It turns into tiny particles, and that's when it's really deadly.
[02:44:57.229 --> 02:44:59.571]  Yep, and it becomes right out your, your, uh,
[02:45:00.672 --> 02:45:04.535]  Your chamber after your, when you discharge the round.
[02:45:04.535 --> 02:45:06.116]  And, but here's the thing.
[02:45:06.116 --> 02:45:13.121]  You know, when it comes to scanners, you were told that you're not close enough so you don't have to worry about it.
[02:45:13.121 --> 02:45:19.045]  Uh, so, you know, we're on the, supposed to be on the outskirts, you know, like helping and things like that.
[02:45:19.045 --> 02:45:29.032]  And, and I will tell you this, you know, you said, uh, uh, you was talking about, uh, um, oh shoot.
[02:45:29.622 --> 02:45:31.564]  I've had the head of the DU program on probably
[02:45:46.923 --> 02:45:48.785]  Fifteen times or more.
[02:45:48.785 --> 02:45:49.947]  Probably twenty times.
[02:45:49.947 --> 02:45:51.108]  I want Doug Rockey back on.
[02:45:51.108 --> 02:45:57.555]  We've got to have him on at least a few times a year because he's pretty sick and it's important to hear what he has to say while he's with us.
[02:45:57.555 --> 02:45:59.698]  But, I mean, they knew it was deadly.
[02:45:59.698 --> 02:46:00.799]  Totally deadly.
[02:46:00.799 --> 02:46:05.124]  He was just involved in the cleanup of it and it killed most of his team in 1991 from the highway of death.
[02:46:06.866 --> 02:46:08.367]  Now it's official.
[02:46:08.367 --> 02:46:17.232]  They tell the troops, they don't even tell them they're being given DU, as you just said, and then they attack facilities and have them roll right into the facilities when
[02:46:19.039 --> 02:46:23.900]  When they should be in full gear, and even getting out of it, they can get enough to kill them.
[02:46:23.900 --> 02:46:25.080]  But again, it takes time.
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:26.480]  That's why the globalists love it.
[02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:32.422]  They love stuff that bioaccumulates and takes time to kill you, because by then you're out of the military.
[02:46:32.422 --> 02:46:39.823]  And see, they don't want you, an old piece of military equipment, that's what you're called by the Pentagon, they don't want you out there.
[02:46:39.823 --> 02:46:41.963]  They want you debilitated.
[02:46:41.963 --> 02:46:44.084]  Or, they want to say you're mentally ill.
[02:46:44.084 --> 02:46:44.424]  Go ahead.
[02:46:45.083 --> 02:47:04.975]  Well, and the other thing, too, is we are told that the Posse Comitatus Act doesn't pertain to us for the plain, simple reason, and I looked it up, you know, I don't know, and I imagine from who I talk to, different military people I talk to, they actually look it up just to see if that's true.
[02:47:04.975 --> 02:47:06.756]  Well, two things came up.
[02:47:06.756 --> 02:47:12.820]  One was the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act of 2007.
[02:47:14.381 --> 02:47:24.950]  Yeah, where they say that the military, that we can be used for, to help the police, you know, for like civil unrest or in case of national emergency and stuff.
[02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:35.378]  But what they did was, is they took that away from Congress and gave the President the authorization to, you know, dispatch the troops.
[02:47:35.999 --> 02:47:42.565]  And he's more or less said that whenever anything comes up, that the troops are to be dispatched.
[02:47:42.565 --> 02:47:47.350]  So, as far as the cost... And that's why they're in regular shootings, that's why they're everywhere.
[02:47:47.350 --> 02:47:49.372]  No, it's dictatorship.
[02:47:49.372 --> 02:47:50.993]  You really know what you're talking about, Roger.
[02:47:50.993 --> 02:47:51.674]  Good to hear from you.
[02:47:51.674 --> 02:47:52.635]  God bless you.
[02:47:52.635 --> 02:47:59.381]  Now, we cut him off earlier because I wanted Mark Dice to be able to finish up, but it's so sad to hear what's happening to Roger.
[02:47:59.381 --> 02:48:01.483]  But they do soft kill you, so...
[02:48:05.762 --> 02:48:08.605]  But young military is not going to listen, and cops aren't going to listen.
[02:48:08.605 --> 02:48:10.387]  A lot of them are on too big a power trip.
[02:48:10.387 --> 02:48:11.888]  Okay.
[02:48:11.888 --> 02:48:12.729]  Okay.
[02:48:12.729 --> 02:48:17.213]  TSA workers, the ones that are smart and don't want to be radiated, they'll just fire you.
[02:48:17.213 --> 02:48:19.676]  They'll find plenty of idiots.
[02:48:19.676 --> 02:48:22.919]  Not just idiots, people who are so trusting.
[02:48:22.919 --> 02:48:24.640]  So trusting.
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:27.603]  Well, this false trust is going to get us all killed.
[02:48:27.603 --> 02:48:28.204]  You just remember that.
[02:48:31.073 --> 02:48:32.193]  Uh, Damon was calling in.
[02:48:32.193 --> 02:48:33.454]  He's a radiation therapist.
[02:48:33.454 --> 02:48:39.716]  He was talking about how many rads they're allowed to get, uh, every year or in their lifetime as a radiologist.
[02:48:39.716 --> 02:48:45.077]  Uh, and then there's just no controls on these body scanners, these truck scanners, these house scanners.
[02:48:45.077 --> 02:48:50.959]  And it shows them on the news, cops driving around with no shielding, with a giant radiation gun on the top.
[02:48:50.959 --> 02:48:52.920]  Uh, finish up any comments you had on that.
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:53.920]  I appreciate you holding, Damon.
[02:48:54.881 --> 02:49:09.890]  Yeah, well, the most important thing I want to get out to the public is that the rule we're taught in school is that you have to, um, the goal is as low as reasonably achievable.
[02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:12.232]  It's ALARA is the acronym we use.
[02:49:12.751 --> 02:49:12.951]  I don't
[02:49:34.522 --> 02:49:45.565]  The possibilities are endless, and I want to go back to the fact that, you know, if we could find out, the Sieberts, there's an equation to determine it, and it's basically one joule per kilogram.
[02:49:46.443 --> 02:50:06.338]  And that's, you know, the energy of the radiation they're using will determine the biological effect on the species, the substance, the biological... Well, we've got hundreds of mainstream articles where they admit, that's what's even crazier, they just admit, yeah, this is cumulatively highly deadly, and it's horrible, but we're just doing it.
[02:50:06.338 --> 02:50:13.523]  Well, here's the problem, too, though, Alex, is that I've got family members, I've got four brothers, and I've got folks and friends, and I tell them, I'm like,
[02:50:13.871 --> 02:50:14.171]  You know what?
[02:50:29.688 --> 02:50:39.211]  You understand that you won't have to worry about whether you have a job in, you know, four or five years, because if you get enough radiation exposed to you, you're going to have a lot more things to worry about than whether you got a job or not.
[02:50:39.211 --> 02:50:42.952]  I mean, why don't they see themselves as saying no?
[02:50:42.952 --> 02:50:43.392]  No!
[02:50:43.392 --> 02:50:46.353]  I mean, they lied and said they weren't saving the images.
[02:50:46.353 --> 02:50:47.973]  Europe's pulling them out.
[02:50:47.973 --> 02:50:52.894]  And so our government's trying to make them keep it because it's not about stopping terrorists.
[02:50:52.894 --> 02:50:55.875]  It's about getting a biometric scan and giving you cancer.
[02:50:55.875 --> 02:50:56.235]  Stay there.
[02:50:56.235 --> 02:50:57.716]  I want to finish up with you, Damon, on the other side.
[02:50:57.716 --> 02:50:58.196]  We'll be right back.
