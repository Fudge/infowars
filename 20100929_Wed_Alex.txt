[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:23.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23.200 --> 00:28.600]  I am wound up today.
[00:28.600 --> 00:33.600]  Everything is really coming into crystal clear focus, confirming all of our previous
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.360]  analysis and adding a lot of new developments to it.
[00:39.360 --> 00:44.160]  We've got Mark Dice of the Resistance joining us to talk about the zombie population and
[00:44.160 --> 00:49.160]  how they're selling people more and more to be narcissistic so they're compartmentalized
[00:49.160 --> 00:51.440]  and don't even care about themselves.
[00:51.440 --> 00:56.120]  When you really become totally narcissistic, you just lose all connection to reality and
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.840]  you stop caring about other people, and hence, no one cares about you, and the world becomes
[01:00.840 --> 01:02.240]  a living Hades.
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.000]  Okay, look at all these stacks of news in front of me, if you're a prisonplanet.tv,
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.960]  or if you're a radio listener, just go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com to look
[01:11.960 --> 01:12.960]  it all up.
[01:12.960 --> 01:16.320]  Look at this little story right here.
[01:16.320 --> 01:24.040]  This little story right here is out of Der Spiegel, the biggest publication in Deutschland,
[01:24.040 --> 01:29.600]  and it says, former Stasi cryptographers now develop technology for NATO.
[01:29.600 --> 01:34.520]  Remember seven, eight years ago when Homeland Security paid a million dollars plus a year
[01:34.520 --> 01:42.880]  for two years straight to Marcus Wolf, the former head of the Stasi, the model for 1984
[01:42.880 --> 01:48.360]  to set that up in the U.S. to set up the rollout of the spy grid, the citizen spies, all of
[01:48.360 --> 01:49.360]  it?
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.400]  Well, here's some more news on that today.
[01:53.400 --> 01:59.720]  In Europe as well, this is a Stasi state that is being set up.
[01:59.720 --> 02:02.280]  We're going to be talking about it.
[02:02.280 --> 02:07.040]  Also I saw a report up on prisonplanet.com this morning at about 6 a.m. when I got up,
[02:07.040 --> 02:14.960]  Watson was posting stories, and it was counterterror operations, stops trucks on I-20, WSB-TV,
[02:14.960 --> 02:19.880]  and buried in the article, they admit they were radiating the vehicles with X-ray systems.
[02:19.880 --> 02:22.960]  And of course, you know about Forbes and others reporting, we told you about this years ago,
[02:22.960 --> 02:30.520]  but now it's admitted, 500 in the latest purchase of mobile X-ray trucks that are at least according
[02:30.520 --> 02:38.520]  to radiologists we've interviewed and engineers, 10 times stronger than a chest X-ray.
[02:38.520 --> 02:41.400]  And they are driving through every major neighborhood.
[02:41.400 --> 02:43.160]  This is just one purchase of 500.
[02:43.160 --> 02:48.080]  The intel we've got is there's thousands of these vehicles, X-ray trucks, thousands of
[02:48.080 --> 02:53.640]  big surveillance trucks that local police have hooked into the feds that have other
[02:53.640 --> 02:56.320]  electronic systems to pick up everything you're doing.
[02:56.320 --> 03:00.160]  I know the Austin Police Department has three of these stinking things, just where I live
[03:00.160 --> 03:02.560]  in a town of less than a million people.
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.360]  It is total Stasi.
[03:05.360 --> 03:11.360]  It makes the greatest surveillance police state on earth look like child's play.
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.200]  It's just the Stasi had secret arrest, torture, and suppressed political dissent.
[03:16.200 --> 03:20.880]  But we have more surveillance than they do, and so now right along with all of that, they're
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.560]  now bringing in the physical oppression as well and telling you it's all being done because
[03:25.560 --> 03:29.640]  of men in caves in Afghanistan, but all the internal Homeland Security reports say it's
[03:29.640 --> 03:34.560]  for gun owners, land owners, returning veterans, people that love America and the Bill of
[03:34.560 --> 03:35.560]  Rights.
[03:35.560 --> 03:41.280]  So, I asked Paul Watson this morning to do a detailed boil down on the fact that all
[03:41.280 --> 03:44.520]  over the country, they're not just having warrantless checkpoints, but they have you
[03:44.520 --> 03:48.760]  and your family, and we have newscasts out of New York and other places, with the Army
[03:48.760 --> 03:54.600]  directing people through the X-ray machines that shoot right through your car.
[03:54.600 --> 04:00.200]  And this report doesn't just expose the fact that they're violating the Fourth Amendment.
[04:00.200 --> 04:06.720]  That's a small caveat to the fact that they're now selling the idea that being bathed in
[04:06.720 --> 04:08.840]  radiation is not bad for you.
[04:08.840 --> 04:15.160]  Now, you go back 20 years ago to 1990, the Army report said DU, depleted uranium, was
[04:15.160 --> 04:20.520]  completely deadly, a last-ditch weapon if World War III started, and multiple divisions
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.080]  of armored tanks rolled in out of Eastern Europe and to Western Europe, ground troops
[04:25.080 --> 04:30.080]  would then be served out from the armory, DU weapons.
[04:30.080 --> 04:32.840]  So they could shoot through tanks even with small arms.
[04:32.840 --> 04:37.800]  But they said this is during already a full-bore nuclear war, you only get these out because
[04:37.800 --> 04:40.760]  it's going to radiate and poison our own trips.
[04:40.760 --> 04:44.400]  But if they're about to be killed by a Russian armored division, better than, you know, better
[04:44.400 --> 04:50.360]  than at least die five years later or 10 years later from radiation and poisoning, now they
[04:50.360 --> 04:55.520]  just say, hey, it's not bad, mercury's not bad, melamine's not bad, and we're going
[04:55.520 --> 04:59.960]  to radiate you and your family, we're going to murder you.
[04:59.960 --> 05:02.880]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[05:02.880 --> 05:06.840]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[05:06.840 --> 05:09.600]  Be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[05:09.600 --> 05:15.000]  You need to get your own supply of high-quality, storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.440]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great
[05:19.440 --> 05:20.920]  food to choose from.
[05:20.920 --> 05:23.320]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis.
[05:23.320 --> 05:26.640]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[05:26.640 --> 05:31.080]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two-week supply of delicious, easy-to-fix food.
[05:31.080 --> 05:35.000]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.720]  Iran the next three months.
[05:36.720 --> 05:41.760]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.
[05:41.760 --> 05:44.160]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.

[06:00.200 --> 06:06.880]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[06:06.880 --> 06:11.720]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[06:11.720 --> 06:20.640]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[06:20.640 --> 06:27.880]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[06:27.880 --> 06:33.880]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[06:33.880 --> 06:38.840]  Blue diamond gussets got it, other stone.
[06:38.840 --> 06:45.640]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[06:45.640 --> 06:50.200]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[06:50.200 --> 06:52.360]  ride all day with confidence.
[06:52.360 --> 06:55.280]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[06:55.280 --> 06:57.480]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[06:57.480 --> 06:59.680]  Doors don't.
[06:59.680 --> 07:03.760]  Let me tell you a little bit about one of our great sponsors, HomeGain.com.

[07:58.160 --> 08:19.880]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[08:19.880 --> 08:26.640]  You take my life, but I'll take yours too, you fire a musket, but I'll run you through,
[08:26.640 --> 08:30.960]  and when we're waiting for the next attack, you better stand.
[08:30.960 --> 08:38.920]  There is no falling back, because on this battlefield, no one wins.
[08:38.920 --> 08:45.240]  You fire a musket, but I'll run you through, so when you're waiting for the next attack,
[08:45.240 --> 08:51.960]  I want the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers to see this if they'll aim the document cam at this
[08:51.960 --> 09:01.600]  chessboard over here at 1.30 in the middle of the third hour.
[09:01.600 --> 09:10.880]  I am going to basically give you a parallel, a parable, a analogy of the New World Order
[09:10.880 --> 09:15.680]  system via the chessboard.
[09:15.680 --> 09:26.040]  So that is coming up in about two hours and 20 minutes from now.
[09:26.040 --> 09:29.080]  Because on this battlefield, no one wins.
[09:29.080 --> 09:35.400]  The globalist, when they're killing enemies with depleted uranium weapons, are also bathing
[09:35.400 --> 09:39.740]  our own troops in the soft-kill weapon.
[09:39.740 --> 09:46.120]  It's hard kill when it's first used, but the derivative of it is a soft kill.
[09:46.120 --> 09:52.520]  And we're going to be discussing that coming up in this article by Paul Joseph Watson up
[09:52.520 --> 10:03.800]  at PrisonPlanet.com, feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints, feds radiating Americans
[10:03.800 --> 10:06.080]  at internal checkpoints.
[10:06.080 --> 10:13.800]  Boy, if there was ever going to be a Google search of the day, it's feds radiating Americans.
[10:13.800 --> 10:14.920]  People need to know about this.
[10:14.920 --> 10:15.920]  They need to fight it.
[10:15.920 --> 10:16.920]  They need to say no.
[10:16.920 --> 10:18.600]  They need to understand what's happening.
[10:18.600 --> 10:25.400]  The incredible precedent being set to roll out naked body scanners at county courthouses,
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.560]  federal courthouses, mobile vans, at least 500, driving by without warrants.
[10:30.560 --> 10:32.400]  That's another issue.
[10:32.400 --> 10:38.600]  Riding your house in at least 10 times the radiation of a high-powered chest x-ray.
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.440]  They've now got super high-powered MRIs, and even the New York Times admits is giving people
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.560]  brain damage and cancer, and it's so powerful it makes your hair fall out.
[10:48.560 --> 10:52.000]  Well, this stuff dwarfs that.
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.520]  And it's just open insanity.
[10:54.520 --> 10:58.120]  And Italy announces they're pulling out the naked body scanners because they don't work
[10:58.120 --> 11:01.240]  well, because people are rebelling, people aren't flying.
[11:01.240 --> 11:02.840]  The airlines here want them out.
[11:02.840 --> 11:04.760]  The public is saying no to them.
[11:04.760 --> 11:08.880]  It makes the lines longer, and they lie and say there's no radiation, and we now learn
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.200]  it's massive.
[11:11.200 --> 11:13.400]  And they lie and say they're not saving the images.
[11:13.400 --> 11:14.920]  And of course, they're lying.
[11:14.920 --> 11:16.840]  I told you that a year ago.
[11:16.840 --> 11:17.840]  Now it's admitted.
[11:17.840 --> 11:22.360]  They save it all by design, and yes, they now admit it gives them a biometric scan of
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.040]  your body for biometric scanning.
[11:25.040 --> 11:31.520]  Doesn't matter if Mel Gibson's running around LA in disguises of fake noses and glasses,
[11:31.520 --> 11:35.840]  or if you're running around in disguise, they've got millimeter wave cameras that have already
[11:35.840 --> 11:37.680]  gone up nationwide.
[11:37.680 --> 11:39.080]  I learned about this eight years ago.
[11:39.080 --> 11:45.000]  It's now Wired Magazine that from 200 yards away, Wired reports, shoot through your clothes
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.480]  and scan your biometric signature.
[11:47.480 --> 11:51.120]  But how do they get your body scan attached to your name?
[11:51.120 --> 11:52.640]  You're going to the airport.
[11:52.640 --> 11:53.840]  They've got your name.
[11:53.840 --> 12:00.040]  You're next in the queue, you go through, they get the body scan and bathe you in radiation
[12:00.040 --> 12:03.440]  and set the precedent that they're going to do it.
[12:03.440 --> 12:08.320]  And set the precedent that DARPA and Homeland Security and their private operatives and
[12:08.320 --> 12:13.680]  mercenaries are going to fly around with helicopters and drive around with vans, not bathing your
[12:13.680 --> 12:20.320]  home in radiation, infrared radiation, which can just basically see heat sources like grow
[12:20.320 --> 12:22.280]  lamps.
[12:22.280 --> 12:31.360]  This is classic X-rays going through your house at at least 10 times a chest X-ray.
[12:31.360 --> 12:32.360]  And we've got the newscast.
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.360]  He's got it linked here from Fox in New York, where they go, oh, the troops have helped
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.360]  arrest thousands for guns and drugs.
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.360]  We have people on the highway drive under this X-ray machine, and it shows people in
[12:42.360 --> 12:45.680]  their cars driving through it.
[12:45.680 --> 12:49.480]  Just five years ago, they had these at the border and they get the people out.
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.920]  They put the truck up on a conveyor system and they roll it through and the guys running
[12:54.920 --> 12:58.520]  it get an armored room and run the machine.
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.840]  Now they just say, hey, troops, hey, state police, hey, Homeland Security people, you're
[13:03.840 --> 13:11.000]  going to ride around in vans with X-ray blasters on the roof shooting through people's houses.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.840]  Do you know how much back scatter you're being bathed in?
[13:14.840 --> 13:19.560]  You know, going back when they first developed radar in the 1940s, that until the early 1950s
[13:19.560 --> 13:23.560]  they would have people unshielded in radar systems until they found that most of them
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.280]  died within a decade of cancers.
[13:26.280 --> 13:30.320]  In fact, sometimes people would die within just a few months of being stationed at these
[13:30.320 --> 13:31.320]  facilities.
[13:31.320 --> 13:36.200]  They would joke around at the end of World War II and put their food on a table in front
[13:36.200 --> 13:40.600]  of the radar when they weren't looking for planes and heat their food.
[13:40.600 --> 13:45.360]  They can do that with radio transmitters, can heat the food.
[13:45.360 --> 13:48.760]  You know how many radio engineers I've worked with over the years that talk about how deadly
[13:48.760 --> 13:51.160]  an AM transmitter is up close?
[13:51.160 --> 13:53.880]  How deadly an FM transmitter is up close?
[13:53.880 --> 13:56.520]  Now from every length of the antenna, it loses half its power.
[13:56.520 --> 13:59.080]  So after a few hundred yards, there's almost nothing.
[13:59.080 --> 14:02.800]  But when you're right up next to that baby, you're in trouble.
[14:02.800 --> 14:06.240]  Do you understand?
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.960]  There is a strategic operation to tell the troops DU isn't bad, to use it all over the
[14:10.960 --> 14:16.920]  world, even have it in the smallest calibers of ammo, hundreds of different munitions.
[14:16.920 --> 14:18.320]  They know it's deadly.
[14:18.320 --> 14:23.800]  They're using it at target ranges and proving grounds all over the world, outside major
[14:23.800 --> 14:26.160]  cities and small towns.
[14:26.160 --> 14:28.400]  But this isn't just about being radiated.
[14:28.400 --> 14:35.280]  It's about the mindset of the social engineers to be so bold that they roll out with vaccines
[14:35.280 --> 14:40.280]  they know, maim hundreds of thousands a year, kill tens of thousands on record that they
[14:40.280 --> 14:42.000]  know have mercury in it.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.400]  People complained a decade ago, the media runs a blitz saying there is no mercury in
[14:45.400 --> 14:49.080]  them, but people read the insert and said, here it is, the Marisol.
[14:49.080 --> 14:52.280]  And so they said, okay, mercury's good for you.
[14:52.280 --> 14:55.560]  Oh, China has thousands dying from melamine.
[14:55.560 --> 14:57.240]  We'll just tell you it's good for babies.
[14:57.240 --> 15:00.520]  We'll just tell you it's no problem.
[15:00.520 --> 15:01.520]  Melamine's good.
[15:01.520 --> 15:02.520]  Fluoride's good.
[15:02.520 --> 15:03.520]  Mercury's good.
[15:03.520 --> 15:04.520]  Radiation's good.
[15:04.520 --> 15:05.520]  No, it's not.
[15:05.520 --> 15:08.840]  No, it's not.
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.240]  And it just hit me again this morning at 6 a.m. when I got up and checked PrismPlanet.com
[15:14.240 --> 15:15.640]  and I already knew they were doing this.
[15:15.640 --> 15:19.400]  I remember a year ago we had state reps on the governor put a press release out.
[15:19.400 --> 15:21.920]  It's in police state for the rise of FEMA.
[15:21.920 --> 15:28.440]  They had army and homeland security checkpoints searching entire highways and the governor
[15:28.440 --> 15:32.440]  said you didn't tell me get out of here and they kept doing it.
[15:32.440 --> 15:36.080]  They said you don't have any stinking jurisdiction over your state slave.
[15:36.080 --> 15:37.080]  Shut up.
[15:37.080 --> 15:38.080]  Shut up.
[15:38.080 --> 15:40.000]  They have a shooting in Alabama.
[15:40.000 --> 15:41.400]  The Marine Corps shows up.
[15:41.400 --> 15:43.360]  They have a shooting in Austin.
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.480]  The army shows up.
[15:44.480 --> 15:46.920]  We've got the video of it yesterday.
[15:46.920 --> 15:51.200]  In fact, that's coming up later.
[15:51.200 --> 15:52.200]  I forgot to tell Doug.
[15:52.200 --> 15:55.040]  Let's get that select out of the army, the footage of the army guys they were following.
[15:55.040 --> 15:56.920]  Let's get that.
[15:56.920 --> 15:57.920]  Get that in queue.
[15:57.920 --> 16:00.640]  Thank you.
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.080]  What does this say about the system?
[16:03.080 --> 16:09.320]  What does it say about the system at the end of the day that they have gone from admitting
[16:09.320 --> 16:13.520]  DU is bad and Mercury is bad and all this to just saying hey, it's not bad.
[16:13.520 --> 16:17.680]  It doesn't matter if their own manuals say it's totally deadly, both from the toxicity,
[16:17.680 --> 16:22.880]  the poison, the particular and the radiation, doesn't matter.
[16:22.880 --> 16:24.280]  They just say use it.
[16:24.280 --> 16:28.720]  I mean just seven years ago, eight years ago when they invaded Iraq, they went into the
[16:28.720 --> 16:33.520]  blast points all over the country where they blasted military installations and had our
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.360]  troops move into those installations and they would at least have dump trucks come
[16:37.360 --> 16:43.880]  in and dump some sand in the holes so that maybe some of it would get suppressed so all
[16:43.880 --> 16:46.160]  of it didn't get basically picked up and breathed.
[16:46.160 --> 16:48.800]  Now it's reported in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[16:48.800 --> 16:54.160]  They just tell them no problem in, no masks needed, no nothing, move right into this area.
[16:54.160 --> 16:59.600]  When they blow up a supposed Taliban nest, they don't tell them don't go in there, we
[16:59.600 --> 17:00.600]  just use DU.
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.240]  They just say get in there and get in the intelligence you can.
[17:05.240 --> 17:11.480]  This is a level of wickedness and they just do it and it's part of the population reduction
[17:11.480 --> 17:15.200]  agenda.
[17:15.200 --> 17:21.960]  And so we've got this report up on PrisonPlanet.com feds radiating Americans at internal check
[17:21.960 --> 17:24.320]  points.
[17:24.320 --> 17:30.120]  Oh man, this is horrible.
[17:30.120 --> 17:35.120]  While illegals and hardcore drugs flood the country across the border, authorities target
[17:35.120 --> 17:37.600]  truck drivers in Atlanta.
[17:37.600 --> 17:40.880]  Federal authorities do not concern themselves with the flood of illegal immigrants and drugs
[17:40.880 --> 17:41.880]  crossing the border every day.
[17:41.880 --> 17:44.580]  In fact, they've announced they've pulled the border patrol back and aren't even deporting
[17:44.580 --> 17:45.840]  illegals now.
[17:45.840 --> 17:49.720]  They're more worried about radiating American truck drivers at internal check points with
[17:49.720 --> 17:55.000]  mobile scanners that shoot dangerous X-rays through both vehicles and passengers.
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.120]  As reported last month, a federal government has acquired hundreds of backscatter X-ray
[17:59.120 --> 18:03.440]  scanners mounted in vans that they are now using in randomly scanned vehicles, passengers,
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.600]  homes, and complete violation of the Fourth Amendment and with wanton disregard for the
[18:07.600 --> 18:09.680]  health and consequences.
[18:09.680 --> 18:11.800]  And they don't hide it now.
[18:11.800 --> 18:16.080]  I knew many years ago this was going on, now they've got it on the news.
[18:16.080 --> 18:18.280]  Forcing your family through it, driving by your neighborhood.
[18:18.280 --> 18:20.320]  Oh, look, we just looked their people's walls.
[18:20.320 --> 18:24.680]  It's land of the free, home of the brave.
[18:24.680 --> 18:29.000]  And it goes to the psychology of their just openly training us to be poisoned and radiated
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.920]  and biologically killed.
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.360]  The Gardasil in the trials three and a half years ago killed large percentages of those
[18:34.360 --> 18:38.200]  that took it and named others, gave them autoimmune disorders.
[18:38.200 --> 18:44.720]  The new flu vaccine admittedly massive increases in Guillain beret, narcolepsy, convulsions.
[18:44.720 --> 18:51.040]  They just, oh, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.
[18:51.040 --> 18:56.120]  As an example of their expanding use was reported by WSB TV, the federal agents from several
[18:56.120 --> 18:59.120]  agencies including Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, and TSA set
[18:59.120 --> 19:03.320]  up an internal checkpoint on Interstate 20 just west of Atlanta and detained truck drivers
[19:03.320 --> 19:07.600]  for half an hour or more at a state-owned inspection station while they were scanned
[19:07.600 --> 19:09.560]  with a bomb detection device.
[19:09.560 --> 19:14.280]  Officials, they're not servants, they're officials, admitted there was no specific
[19:14.280 --> 19:16.320]  threat to justify the checkpoint.
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.040]  And they went on to say it was a drill, but then said it was also real.
[19:21.040 --> 19:26.960]  I've seen, we videotaped Army checkpoints at 98 up in Temple.
[19:26.960 --> 19:29.960]  And then the year after that, we were in Temple and they were doing a fake drill and the troops
[19:29.960 --> 19:36.160]  walked right up and said, you don't videotape my face, boy.
[19:36.160 --> 19:39.680]  I'm going to continue with this on the other side, but I mean, look, if they can train
[19:39.680 --> 19:43.920]  you to step into a radiation bathing system that records your naked body, why don't up
[19:43.920 --> 19:46.000]  the ante and start frying you with chest X-rays.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.240]  I said that was next for the airports, they're not talking about chest X-rays at airports
[19:50.240 --> 19:55.480]  to stop breast bombers and why stop at chest X-rays?
[19:55.480 --> 20:02.440]  Something at least 10 times more powerful will fry you and your family.
[20:02.440 --> 20:08.000]  The economy is crumbling, debt soaring, and the possibility of World War III is increasing.
[20:08.000 --> 20:14.800]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table with a small bucket of seed and
[20:14.800 --> 20:20.280]  a single rotating banner ad on prisonplanet.com.
[20:20.280 --> 20:26.320]  Two years later, we've sold over 40,000 pounds of heirloom seeds, becoming the largest bulk
[20:26.320 --> 20:28.520]  seed seller to the public.
[20:28.520 --> 20:33.080]  The majority of our customers are Alex Jones listeners.
[20:33.080 --> 20:40.720]  Now I'm offering 50 all-organic garden varieties, 10,000 heirloom seeds, garden planner, and
[20:40.720 --> 20:47.880]  a CD teaching you how to save seeds so your children's children will always have healthy
[20:47.880 --> 20:48.880]  food.
[20:48.880 --> 21:00.960]  Don't wait until it's too late, I'm Vic John Lipscomb, and my company is survivalistseeds.com.
[21:00.960 --> 21:04.720]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water
[21:04.720 --> 21:05.720]  filtration.
[21:05.720 --> 21:10.360]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers,
[21:10.360 --> 21:14.480]  the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.
[21:14.480 --> 21:18.760]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and recleanable black purification

[21:57.120 --> 22:24.000]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm warning of Greek style U.S. debt
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  crisis.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.760]  The CBO is drawing a parallel between U.S. economy and the Greek economic meltdown.
[22:29.760 --> 22:34.720]  Debt to GDP climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.
[22:34.720 --> 22:39.520]  Hi, Ted Anderson, the federal debt and risk of financial crisis document the CBO has
[22:39.520 --> 22:41.920]  published is a must-read for every American.
[22:41.920 --> 22:46.640]  Covering the risks of deficit spending, aging population and rising interest rates spells
[22:46.640 --> 22:48.200]  economic disaster.
[22:48.200 --> 22:55.680]  Call today at 800-686-2237, I'll send it free, again call 800-686-2237.
[22:55.680 --> 23:00.680]  Ask for the CBO document, call 800-686-2237.
[23:00.680 --> 23:02.800]  As gardeners, we can all relate.
[23:02.800 --> 23:05.200]  What do you do with all of the excess food that you grow?
[23:05.200 --> 23:09.200]  Freezing or canning may have been the process you've used, but the good folks at Excalibur
[23:09.200 --> 23:13.040]  Dehydrator have a healthy alternative to preserve the fruits of your labor.
[23:13.040 --> 23:17.440]  The Excalibur Dehydrator will help you preserve your fruits and vegetables quickly and easily

[23:56.240 --> 23:59.600]  That's 1-800-875-4254 today.
[23:59.600 --> 24:20.600]  If there was ever any doubt in your mind about just how psychopathic and out of control the
[24:20.600 --> 24:25.560]  globalist are, look at how they've hired the Stasi to set up Homeland Security, the
[24:25.560 --> 24:32.560]  former heads of Stasi, that's in Der Spiegel today, over in the EU, at the same here in
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.160]  the US.
[24:34.160 --> 24:38.360]  And they're now driving around for many years, but now publicly telling you they look through
[24:38.360 --> 24:43.840]  your walls and blast you with radiation without a warrant.
[24:43.840 --> 24:49.080]  I mean, you can't take a death row prisoner and give them cruel and unusual punishment
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.080]  and radiate them, but the system just doesn't care.
[24:52.080 --> 24:54.920]  They're all over the news today saying, yeah, they're going to start shutting down freedom
[24:54.920 --> 24:58.000]  on the web.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.880]  In fact, I've got a report here out of the French news agency, and it's only printed
[25:02.880 --> 25:03.880]  one page.
[25:03.880 --> 25:04.880]  You guys print me the whole thing.
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.080]  Internet's creator slams blight of web disconnection laws and basically says the Internet, as
[25:10.080 --> 25:12.680]  we know, is being killed.
[25:12.680 --> 25:21.120]  The Internet's creator is telling you they're killing the Internet slowly as we speak, okay?
[25:21.120 --> 25:23.400]  The time for denial is over.
[25:23.400 --> 25:24.960]  They know we're on to them.
[25:24.960 --> 25:26.280]  They know we're exposing them.
[25:26.280 --> 25:28.680]  They've used the web to get everybody connected and tracked.
[25:28.680 --> 25:32.920]  Now they're going to move to the controlled web unless we stop them.
[25:32.920 --> 25:34.160]  It's happening now.
[25:34.160 --> 25:38.920]  And as the neocons are blaming Obama for this, Obama is a sniveling teleprompter reading
[25:38.920 --> 25:40.520]  puppet, just like they are.
[25:40.520 --> 25:45.200]  This stuff isn't run by Bush or Obama or Sarah Palin or the Easter Bunny.
[25:45.200 --> 25:49.960]  It's run by the Rand Corporation, by the Ford Foundation, by the Carnegie Endowment, by
[25:49.960 --> 25:56.360]  the Pentagon, our criminal government created the UN.
[25:56.360 --> 26:04.040]  You know, there's a microcosm of Glenn Beck, or really a prototypical example would be
[26:04.040 --> 26:10.080]  McCarthy.
[26:10.080 --> 26:15.560]  And you go back to so-called McCarthyism, he was very useful, and he meant well when
[26:15.560 --> 26:18.360]  he was just saying it's low-level communists that have infiltrated us.
[26:18.360 --> 26:23.000]  But when he found out the army was funding the Soviet Union, when he found out that our
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.560]  government and the Ford Foundation and Carnegie and others, this is what he talked about, was
[26:27.560 --> 26:32.520]  setting this up to create the enemy and then transfer us into a global government.
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.080]  This is all declassified now.
[26:34.080 --> 26:37.400]  They came out and politically destroyed him.
[26:37.400 --> 26:38.680]  And what does Glenn Beck do?
[26:38.680 --> 26:40.160]  I've really been analyzing this.
[26:40.160 --> 26:41.560]  He's like a modern McCarthy.
[26:41.560 --> 26:47.280]  He exposes the corrupt unions and casts Sunstein and, you know, tells you they're the top people.
[26:47.280 --> 26:50.440]  The New World Order came out of the United States and England.
[26:50.440 --> 26:56.160]  Eugenics did, not from the American people, the British people, but from the robber barons,
[26:56.160 --> 27:00.680]  from the British Empire that couldn't hold on to its empire through naked force and came
[27:00.680 --> 27:03.680]  up with scientific systems to control people.
[27:03.680 --> 27:05.720]  This is their words.
[27:05.720 --> 27:11.240]  I had a New York Times best-selling author, Emmy-nominated, you know, researcher who got
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.440]  into the Iran Corporation documents, they let him in, and it's all world government,
[27:15.440 --> 27:18.520]  all total tyranny.
[27:18.520 --> 27:20.600]  And how the elite are going to have immortality.
[27:20.600 --> 27:21.600]  That's their goal.
[27:21.600 --> 27:25.880]  Whether it's real or not, they want a global police state to put it in place so we're straight
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.880]  jacketed down when they kill our hind ends with soft-kill weapons.
[27:30.880 --> 27:33.240]  Everybody starts wondering why half the people have cancer.
[27:33.240 --> 27:35.600]  They just will play that out.
[27:35.600 --> 27:41.520]  They're testing doing this slowly, seeing what they can get away with, incrementalism.
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.800]  And now, they're openly rolling around with these vans, violating your rights and radiating
[27:46.800 --> 27:50.280]  you.
[27:50.280 --> 27:55.080]  American science and engineering company based in Massachusetts has sold many of the devices
[27:55.080 --> 28:01.120]  to U.S. law enforcement agencies who are already using them on the streets for security purposes.
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.920]  Without a warrant, the government doesn't have a right to peer beneath your clothes without
[28:04.920 --> 28:10.280]  probable cause, points out Mark Rottenberg, executive director of Epic.
[28:10.280 --> 28:13.920]  And airport scans are typically used only as secondary security measure.
[28:13.920 --> 28:18.400]  If the scans can only be in exceptional cases in airports, and that's even wrong, the idea
[28:18.400 --> 28:24.400]  that they can be used routinely on city streets is very hard argument to make.
[28:24.400 --> 28:28.200]  Well, I mean, even the people criticizing this are doing it mildly.
[28:28.200 --> 28:30.360]  This is far worse than that.
[28:30.360 --> 28:33.960]  We have warned from the very beginning, everything you see being rolled out in the airports is
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.440]  eventually designed to hit the streets of America because prisoners in their own communities
[28:38.440 --> 28:42.240]  can constantly harass, scan and surveil by the oppressive state.
[28:42.240 --> 28:45.400]  And I didn't just imagine this and then I'm right.
[28:45.400 --> 28:50.720]  I saw Governor Ridge before Homeland Security even got funding and became a cabinet position
[28:50.720 --> 28:54.320]  say they were going to have naked body scanners on the streets.
[28:54.320 --> 28:59.080]  They were going to have TSA Viper teams on the highways and in the bus stops and in the
[28:59.080 --> 29:00.080]  trains.
[29:00.080 --> 29:03.000]  And what does the report say about Atlanta?
[29:03.000 --> 29:11.080]  Viper teams TSA on I-20, they're going to have naked body scanners in the mall to get
[29:11.080 --> 29:19.400]  in a building folks.
[29:19.400 --> 29:21.840]  I am so angry that it's freezing cold.
[29:21.840 --> 29:26.720]  It's 68 degrees in this office and I'm sweating because at a primitive level, I am threatened
[29:26.720 --> 29:29.560]  by this new world order at a primitive level.
[29:29.560 --> 29:34.760]  I understand this control grid being set up and I have all their own admissions of it.
[29:34.760 --> 29:38.960]  Oh, it makes me sick, I'm going to finish up on this article and then get into all the
[29:38.960 --> 29:39.960]  other news.
[29:39.960 --> 29:47.040]  It's just, it's a nightmare.
[29:47.040 --> 29:49.920]  And they're telling these cops and people running these scanners that it's not bad for
[29:49.920 --> 29:50.920]  them.
[29:50.920 --> 29:54.520]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.
[29:54.520 --> 30:20.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:20.320 --> 30:25.080]  Take my word for it, once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else since 1947
[30:25.080 --> 30:29.520]  Calben Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle
[30:29.520 --> 30:30.520]  on the environment.

[30:58.560 --> 30:59.720]  Thank you.
[30:59.720 --> 31:04.360]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[31:04.360 --> 31:08.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[31:08.680 --> 31:13.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.280]  allows you to have.
[31:14.280 --> 31:20.040]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[31:20.040 --> 31:24.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[31:24.360 --> 31:28.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.360 --> 31:31.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:31.840 --> 31:35.560]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[31:35.560 --> 31:40.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:40.280 --> 31:44.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[31:44.120 --> 31:45.520]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:45.520 --> 31:49.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[31:49.760 --> 31:51.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[31:59.280 --> 32:02.480]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[32:02.480 --> 32:06.440]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[32:06.440 --> 32:09.200]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[32:09.200 --> 32:14.600]  You need to get your own supply of high quality, storeable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[32:14.600 --> 32:19.040]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating, with a ton of great

[32:20.520 --> 32:22.920]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis.
[32:22.920 --> 32:26.240]  Not some old, cruddy food they're selling you like some of the other guys.
[32:26.240 --> 32:30.680]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[32:30.680 --> 32:34.600]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on
[32:34.600 --> 32:39.240]  Iran the next three months, the crisis in the Gulf, and possible evacuations.
[32:39.240 --> 32:41.360]  Get yourself and your family ready today.

[33:02.560 --> 33:14.400]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[33:14.400 --> 33:21.040]  What's happening is psychologically we're being conditioned, we're being sold to accept
[33:21.040 --> 33:22.040]  anything.
[33:22.040 --> 33:27.400]  Oh, the government hired the Stasi to train them how to spy on you, oh, they're training
[33:27.400 --> 33:32.720]  your kids in public school to spy on you, oh, they're training the explorer scouts
[33:32.720 --> 33:38.920]  to take on veterans that won't turn in their guns, New York Times, isn't that great, oh,
[33:38.920 --> 33:44.360]  we're driving around radiating your house without a warrant, and they just do it.
[33:44.360 --> 33:48.640]  Look, these people are in control of the major courts, they're in control of most of the
[33:48.640 --> 33:50.400]  states, the federal government.
[33:50.400 --> 33:58.080]  They're in so much control, Congress can't even find where $28 trillion went.
[33:58.080 --> 34:07.080]  And the system is just literally going for broke here, it's going completely insane.
[34:07.080 --> 34:16.080]  It's doing whatever it wants, and it's only going to get more crazy from here.
[34:16.080 --> 34:24.200]  They're just trying to normalize all of this bizarre scientific sci-fi tyranny and dehumanization
[34:24.200 --> 34:25.700]  as if it's normal.
[34:25.700 --> 34:30.320]  Notice they're all over the news every day now saying, should vaccines be mandatory?
[34:30.320 --> 34:34.240]  They've already tried through color law to say to have a job at a hospital or to be in
[34:34.240 --> 34:40.720]  a college or to be in a public school, you've got to have all these vaccines, it's a lie.
[34:40.720 --> 34:43.720]  So now that people have woken up that it's a lie, they're like, well, maybe we will make
[34:43.720 --> 34:50.120]  you, trust us, we're always promoting world population reduction, we've been caught in
[34:50.120 --> 34:53.800]  tens of thousands of chemical, biological, and radiological tests, in many cases that
[34:53.800 --> 35:01.320]  killed US citizens and others, oh, we just tested nerve gas over and over again and biologicals
[35:01.320 --> 35:08.160]  on our own troops, but it's not their troops, they hate the troops, they use the troops.
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.320]  Now they tell the troops, do you use, not bad.
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.800]  So think about this, do listeners want to make this the number one search term?
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.720]  I mean, I think this is one of the most important ones we've had, but I don't want to continue
[35:19.720 --> 35:23.960]  doing this if it's not going to be the number one search, there's only been a few cases
[35:23.960 --> 35:29.360]  out of 26 times that it hadn't hit number one, and I do want it to be number one, so
[35:29.360 --> 35:36.080]  people then link through to this story, they're like, what's Feds radiating Americans?
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.080]  Three words, Feds radiating Americans, what is that?
[35:40.080 --> 35:46.160]  Well, they'll click on it and they'll find the article from prisonplanet.com and infowars.com,
[35:46.160 --> 35:52.000]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.920]  Nationwide, you're going to be directed through these, you're going to be put through these
[35:54.920 --> 36:05.320]  at the airports, and they're increasing many times more powerful than chest x-rays.
[36:05.320 --> 36:09.800]  And do they tell the workers, get behind lead shielding, no, that's what's so wild
[36:09.800 --> 36:17.400]  about this, they're training us to just die, they're training us to just come up with
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.400]  the cancers and all the illnesses and the media just, we don't know why it's increasing.
[36:23.400 --> 36:29.920]  That's what they think of you, they think you're that stupid.
[36:29.920 --> 36:33.040]  In fact, I wasn't going to open the phones up this hour, but I want to open the phones
[36:33.040 --> 36:39.320]  up for Homeland Security, police, military, border patrol, people that run these machines,
[36:39.320 --> 36:44.720]  because I know before they would just put a truck or a car on a big mobile system and
[36:44.720 --> 36:50.120]  it had rollers on it and would roll it across and everybody got an armored shelter.
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.600]  Now we've had radiologists on about this, they have high-powered radiation machines
[36:54.600 --> 36:59.800]  that are at least 10 times more powerful than chest x-rays rolling around, blasting through
[36:59.800 --> 37:02.840]  people's houses and frying the people inside the vehicles.
[37:02.840 --> 37:06.960]  I mean, that's a big deal, not to mention the Fourth Amendment of them looking through
[37:06.960 --> 37:07.960]  your walls.
[37:07.960 --> 37:15.400]  Oh, that East Germany, they were bad, they spied on people.
[37:15.400 --> 37:21.040]  And again, here is their spiegel today.
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.680]  Former Stasi cryptographers now develop technology for NATO and it goes on to talk about it all
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.880]  these different to secret operations, how they've been hired to work with the EU to
[37:32.880 --> 37:36.040]  setting up these grids.
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.640]  And it's the same story seven, eight years ago, right when Homeland Security got set
[37:39.640 --> 37:40.640]  up.
[37:40.640 --> 37:44.520]  For two years, they had multi-million dollar contracts for people like Marcus Wolfe, the
[37:44.520 --> 37:46.240]  former head of the Stasi.
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.840]  And when I saw that, I didn't believe it, and I went and looked up the federal funding
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.040]  orders and sure enough, it was there.
[37:55.040 --> 38:01.560]  You can't make that type of stuff up.
[38:01.560 --> 38:04.880]  As we've warned from the very beginning, everything you see being rolled out in the
[38:04.880 --> 38:08.640]  airports is eventually designed to hit the streets as America becomes prisoners in their
[38:08.640 --> 38:14.000]  own communities, constantly harass, scanned and surveilled by an oppressive state.
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.000]  Mobile scanners for crowds that would be used at football matches and other public events
[38:18.000 --> 38:21.200]  have already been announced, where they just blast everyone.
[38:21.200 --> 38:28.520]  As have proposals to fit lampposts with CCTV cameras that would X-ray scan passersby, undressing
[38:28.520 --> 38:31.720]  them in order to trap terror suspects.
[38:31.720 --> 38:39.560]  I saw CBS News in 2001 saying they were already testing them in several major U.S. airports.
[38:39.560 --> 38:41.760]  Passive scanners.
[38:41.760 --> 38:46.880]  Body and vehicle scanners are just one tool, authorities, not servants, authorities, plan
[38:46.880 --> 38:52.040]  to implement on a widespread basis as part of our deepening decline in a high-tech militarized
[38:52.040 --> 38:53.540]  police state.
[38:53.540 --> 38:58.560]  Homeland Security is already implementing technology to be enforced at security events,
[38:58.560 --> 39:08.600]  which purportedly reads, on behalf of an individual who passes through a checkpoint, malintent.
[39:08.600 --> 39:12.320]  It shows if you may look angry, facial trackers.
[39:12.320 --> 39:18.520]  The video below explains how the future attributed screening technology or fast checkpoints will
[39:18.520 --> 39:22.480]  conduct psychological and behavioral tests in order to weed out suspected terrorists
[39:22.480 --> 39:23.480]  and criminals.
[39:23.480 --> 39:27.040]  And two years ago, Homeland Security actually heard proposals and was favorable to make
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.760]  everyone wear a high-powered taser bracelet.
[39:29.760 --> 39:35.480]  Everyone, when you get on board the aircraft, and now major European aircraft companies
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.080]  are saying that they'll be fitted with cameras in the back seat that listens and records
[39:40.080 --> 39:44.040]  and everything goes through an AI computer that records everything you're saying and
[39:44.040 --> 39:45.680]  looks for anything threatening.
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.800]  All of you being watched by cameras as you fly with taser bracelets.
[39:49.800 --> 39:55.920]  But let me tell you, that's not even as out of control nightmare as mobile vans violating
[39:55.920 --> 39:59.960]  your Fourth Amendment, driving around blasting your house with radiation.
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.040]  I mean, I can't believe this, and this is only the beginning.
[40:05.040 --> 40:09.280]  Remember Bill Clinton's executive order for the biometric thumb scans that he signed in
[40:09.280 --> 40:10.280]  1994?
[40:10.280 --> 40:17.560]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design, and I go in and get arrested protesting
[40:17.560 --> 40:18.560]  it.
[40:18.560 --> 40:19.560]  And I hand out the executive order.
[40:19.560 --> 40:21.400]  People said, what's Alex making up?
[40:21.400 --> 40:24.680]  They're not taking blood and DNA to get a driver's license.
[40:24.680 --> 40:26.440]  They put it on the books.
[40:26.440 --> 40:30.240]  They haven't implemented it, and now I've seen mainstream news articles saying, should
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.480]  we take blood and DNA and test for drugs when you get a driver's license?
[40:34.480 --> 40:37.320]  Should we put clinics in?
[40:37.320 --> 40:43.360]  Oh, that's a free society where you go in and have your blood taken, or you have a
[40:43.360 --> 40:48.080]  cheek swab taken of your DNA to get a driver's license, or they say they could take your
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.440]  hair and test for drugs.
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.120]  Did you ever use drugs?
[40:53.120 --> 40:57.680]  Remember for 39 years, anyone born in the U.S. or England or Australia and a whole bunch
[40:57.680 --> 41:05.280]  of other Western countries, continuity of agenda, a global system 39 years ago set up
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.360]  to take your baby's blood at birth, and they give the parents a nice little cover story.
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.880]  Oh, we're doing this to check for blood diseases, and of course then you ask them, well, why
[41:14.880 --> 41:16.440]  don't the hospital just do that?
[41:16.440 --> 41:18.080]  Why's it go to the health department?
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.440]  It's a state mandate, and I looked around at them and I said, I happened to actually
[41:22.440 --> 41:27.560]  know about this, here's the secret documents, not even declassified at the time that I'd
[41:27.560 --> 41:29.840]  been leaked, now they're declassified.
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.440]  This goes into a DNA database, and then theirs is like, well, we know that too, as if because
[41:36.440 --> 41:42.160]  they've been led in on a little secret, it's okay, all part of a culture of lies.
[41:42.160 --> 41:52.360]  Oh, hon, we're just taking the blood to test your baby for diseases.
[41:52.360 --> 41:55.200]  A year ago when they declassified, all that, everybody was calling me going, it's exactly
[41:55.200 --> 41:58.760]  as you said, it's a Pentagon database run by the UN, how did you know it?
[41:58.760 --> 42:05.440]  Because I was sent the information 14 years ago by a nurse in San Antonio, and then I
[42:05.440 --> 42:09.960]  learned that members of the Australian parliament knew about it and were criticizing it, and
[42:09.960 --> 42:14.040]  I had a member of the US House of Representatives on from Virginia who was criticizing it in
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.720]  the last decade, and you know why it's a big debate in Australia, they're a few years ahead
[42:19.720 --> 42:20.720]  of us in some respects.
[42:20.720 --> 42:25.360]  It was about five, six years ago, they started announcing in Australia, should Australia use
[42:25.360 --> 42:31.960]  its secret DNA database of all those born in crime investigations?
[42:31.960 --> 42:35.760]  Oh, we just so happened to have this DNA database we didn't tell you about, and Australians
[42:35.760 --> 42:38.360]  went, huh, you have my blood, where'd you get it?
[42:38.360 --> 42:42.040]  When you were a baby.
[42:42.040 --> 42:47.160]  I mean, think about how sickening this is, oh, let me continue, though.
[42:47.160 --> 42:52.440]  I mean, if I pulled up in front of your house with a high-powered x-ray gun and looked through
[42:52.440 --> 42:57.360]  your walls, you'd come out and punch me in the nose, you pervert peeping Tom, but Americans
[42:57.360 --> 43:03.280]  are so scared of people in black vans and suits all acting tough that, oh, I better
[43:03.280 --> 43:08.000]  not even say anything there's a van outside x-raying me, I better lick their boots, thank
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.840]  you for assaulting me with radiation, thank you government, thank you, thank you private
[43:12.840 --> 43:16.960]  contractors and the idiots, because they're given a little security clearance and a little
[43:16.960 --> 43:21.200]  technicians outfitter a black suit and their sunglasses and they all act when the movies
[43:21.200 --> 43:24.760]  all build them up is real tough, they're just in there with a backscatter radiating them
[43:24.760 --> 43:29.920]  and they like it too, because they're on a power trip and they've made the decision that
[43:29.920 --> 43:33.840]  the radiation's not bad for them, just like they've told the troops, oh, do you use not
[43:33.840 --> 43:35.440]  bad anymore?
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.240]  It's got a four billion year half-life, pull up the half-life of depleted uranium, I think
[43:39.240 --> 43:46.880]  it's four bill, but let's make sure I'm right, but yeah, it's no problem.
[43:46.880 --> 43:52.200]  So mobile scanners at football games, CCTV cameras that scan you on the street, body and
[43:52.200 --> 43:55.960]  vehicle scanners are just one tool authorities plan to implement, Homeland Security's already
[43:55.960 --> 44:00.600]  implementing technology to be enforced at security events, this clip shows individuals
[44:00.600 --> 44:04.560]  who attend security events being led into trailers before they are interrogated as to
[44:04.560 --> 44:08.840]  whether they are terrorists, this is concerts you name it, while lie detector-style computer
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.880]  programs analyze their psychological responses, the subjects are asked about their whereabouts
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.680]  and if they are attempting to smuggle bombs or recording devices into the expo, so the
[44:18.680 --> 44:23.600]  message is if you're smuggling in a cell phone to videotape the concert, that's the same
[44:23.600 --> 44:32.280]  as bombs, see the message is you're a terrorist and you just got to not go to football games
[44:32.280 --> 44:35.360]  and go to places that have these, that's why the airports are already wanting to pull
[44:35.360 --> 44:39.840]  them because air travels down so much, but the globalists don't care that own the airlines,
[44:39.840 --> 44:43.400]  they print the money, but some of the executives and people don't like it, that's why Italy
[44:43.400 --> 44:48.960]  said they want to pull them out and are pulling them out.
[44:48.960 --> 44:51.960]  The subjects are asked about their whereabouts and if they are attempting to smuggle bombs
[44:51.960 --> 44:55.920]  or recording devices in the expo, proving that the technology is intended to be used
[44:55.920 --> 44:59.800]  at public events and not just airports, individuals who do not satisfy the first lie detector
[44:59.800 --> 45:05.720]  test are then asked additional questions and everyone's run through them and then of course
[45:05.720 --> 45:09.480]  this is the new economy so the only jobs, a lot of the guys going to the concert are
[45:09.480 --> 45:13.520]  actually going to be, well I run one of these scanners down at the mall Bill, how you doing?
[45:13.520 --> 45:16.520]  Oh put me in the radiation bather, I love it.
[45:16.520 --> 45:22.240]  I just got diagnosed with testicular cancer at 31 yesterday, I don't know why but I like
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.520]  the power, I like it, I like it.
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.600]  The implementation of checkpoint USA where citizens are routinely stopped, searched and
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.960]  radiated by federal viper teams, there's further evidence that America is crumbling into a
[45:35.960 --> 45:40.600]  Soviet style, the Soviets weren't this bad, police state where the presumption of innocence
[45:40.600 --> 45:44.720]  until proven guilty is abolished and the Fourth Amendment eviscerated, I thought the Rand
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.280]  Corporation and the Pentagon built this police state up to protect me from the Ruskies, oh
[45:49.280 --> 45:53.080]  I'm sorry they funded them from the start.
[45:53.080 --> 45:56.920]  Privacy organizations and civil rights lawyers need to actively and immediately bring lawsuits
[45:56.920 --> 46:00.120]  against the federal government for unleashing this tyranny upon the American people, it's
[46:00.120 --> 46:04.080]  also in Europe I would add, as part of a bid to create a chilling atmosphere that ends
[46:04.080 --> 46:08.800]  all dissent and makes the people fear their own government as they are made to prove that
[46:08.800 --> 46:13.520]  they are not criminals or terrorists on a day to day basis while a high tech slave pen is
[46:13.520 --> 46:23.200]  constructed around their entire existence.
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.720]  So let's make this the number one search term, feds radiating Americans, I think this is
[46:27.720 --> 46:34.880]  a pretty important issue, three words, we'll put it on screen, feds radiating Americans,
[46:34.880 --> 46:45.440]  F-E-D-S is the first word, radiating R-A-D-I-A-T-I-N-G Americans, feds radiating Americans, three
[46:45.440 --> 46:52.280]  words and the good news is here that many countries are announcing that they've done
[46:52.280 --> 46:59.920]  the trials, they're removing them, Italy to abandon airport body scanner project, AP,
[46:59.920 --> 47:04.520]  but meanwhile Napolitano strikes back one day later, pitches plan for airport security
[47:04.520 --> 47:11.160]  in 190 nations where the U.S. government's even offering money to get them to accept
[47:11.160 --> 47:19.560]  the scanners, there's another report here, body scanner backlash grows and now in places
[47:19.560 --> 47:27.520]  like El Paso they're trying to force everyone into the scanners, it's incremental conditioning,
[47:27.520 --> 47:33.040]  here's Janet Napolitano urges next stage of airport screening, the questions, the interrogations,
[47:33.040 --> 47:39.040]  the brain scanners, the face scanners, that's in CBS News, all announced, here it is from
[47:39.040 --> 47:44.760]  Homeland Security itself, secure flight program, they're announcing the new dog training, the
[47:44.760 --> 47:51.000]  next phase, the next row of bigger, sharper Homeland Security shark teeth biting into
[47:51.000 --> 48:02.680]  you and your family, and who's been advising them, who's been advising, the Stasi have
[48:02.680 --> 48:11.080]  been advising the United States and Europe on how to do this, and what does the Rand
[48:11.080 --> 48:16.360]  Corporation say, what does the National Intelligence Council say, they say it's the U.S. government's
[48:16.360 --> 48:23.040]  policy to merge us into a world government where by 2025 we are all biologically managed
[48:23.040 --> 48:29.760]  by the state to be cognitively enhanced, they're going to drug us and they're cognitive enhancement,
[48:29.760 --> 48:34.240]  they say mercury cognitively enhances you is being a brain damaged, servile idiot who
[48:34.240 --> 48:38.400]  doesn't notice that half the people on their block are dying of one disease or another,
[48:38.400 --> 48:42.360]  because they just incrementally turn the poisoning up, turn the poisoning up, turn the death
[48:42.360 --> 48:46.280]  up, executives are dying, their kids are dying, they still don't care, they love it, they
[48:46.280 --> 48:50.640]  love dying, the cops love all the vaccines, they love shooting their kids up, they love
[48:50.640 --> 48:56.680]  the radiation, blasters, they love, they just love it, they love it, they love losing,
[48:56.680 --> 49:00.840]  they love failing, they love losing their humanity, they enjoy it, because they have
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.680]  little fantasy shows with Jack Bauer and other TV programs where they torture people and
[49:05.680 --> 49:08.960]  spy and the government's good.
[49:08.960 --> 49:09.960]  That's television.
[49:09.960 --> 49:14.600]  You know, we put a video out, is Glenn Beck for real, where I say, well, he's moving
[49:14.600 --> 49:19.960]  in a better direction admitting the world government wants to reduce our population.
[49:19.960 --> 49:23.360]  But he tells you it's low level communists that are doing it.
[49:23.360 --> 49:27.920]  Communism is only one fake revolution of the megabanks.
[49:27.920 --> 49:32.920]  And Beck's always quoting Carol Quigley if he read his 1100 page book or read his other
[49:32.920 --> 49:37.920]  500 page book, the Anglo-American establishment or 400 or whatever it is, he'd know that
[49:37.920 --> 49:43.360]  this guy was given access to the Rand Corporation and to all these other institutions.
[49:43.360 --> 49:47.600]  And he said, we're setting up a world government, we control the communist and the fascist.
[49:47.600 --> 49:52.640]  We fund it all and we want authoritarian rule and authoritarian rule is good.
[49:52.640 --> 49:57.840]  The Pentagon runs the communist, the Pentagon runs the Muslim extremist, the Pentagon runs
[49:57.840 --> 50:03.980]  the Black Panthers, the Pentagon runs Mecha and LaRaza, the Pentagon is a giant death
[50:03.980 --> 50:08.400]  star to take down freedom.
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.560]  The Pentagon hates the troops and tells them DU is not bad for him and uses them as guinea
[50:13.560 --> 50:15.960]  pigs with experimental vaccines.
[50:15.960 --> 50:23.000]  You know, Iraq, one, Iraq, two and Iraq and the folks from Afghanistan, all three of those
[50:23.000 --> 50:28.800]  wars in 1991, 2003 to now, and of course what's happening in Afghanistan, all of them have
[50:28.800 --> 50:32.560]  tripled the rate of birth deformities and cancer.
[50:32.560 --> 50:37.480]  The children in Fallujah have a 14 times higher rate and you don't care, you're like, hey,
[50:37.480 --> 50:40.320]  I'm going to wrap myself in the American flag.
[50:40.320 --> 50:44.360]  My wife's going to have a deformed baby and I'm just going to salute George W. Bush.
[50:44.360 --> 50:47.920]  Oh, thank you for the DU, sir, thank you, thank you.
[50:47.920 --> 50:52.880]  I mean, I mean, this is hell, this is hell, this is hell being released on us.
[50:52.880 --> 50:57.720]  You understand that, you understand our country was taken over a long time ago, the communists
[50:57.720 --> 51:00.760]  are run by the government.
[51:00.760 --> 51:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[51:05.400 --> 51:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[51:09.720 --> 51:14.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[51:14.040 --> 51:15.360]  allows you to have.
[51:15.360 --> 51:21.040]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.400]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[51:25.400 --> 51:29.400]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[51:29.400 --> 51:32.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[51:32.880 --> 51:36.600]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[51:36.600 --> 51:41.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[51:41.280 --> 51:45.120]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[51:45.120 --> 51:46.500]  one of my old sponsors.
[51:46.500 --> 51:50.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[51:50.760 --> 52:00.680]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[52:00.680 --> 52:03.080]  They help to create a new world order.
[52:03.080 --> 52:08.680]  We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[52:08.680 --> 52:12.760]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and
[52:12.760 --> 52:13.760]  documents.
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.200]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:18.200 --> 52:20.680]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:20.680 --> 52:23.440]  The United Nations would take over America.
[52:23.440 --> 52:26.760]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:26.760 --> 52:31.720]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.720 --> 52:34.200]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:34.200 --> 52:38.320]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for
[52:38.320 --> 52:40.000]  the global financial system.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.560]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:42.560 --> 52:46.280]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[52:46.280 --> 52:47.440]  And I got news for you.
[52:47.440 --> 52:49.080]  You're everyone else.

[53:00.000 --> 53:01.360]  This may surprise you.
[53:01.360 --> 53:05.800]  Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions among both adults and children.
[53:05.800 --> 53:07.840]  You or someone you know may have it.
[53:07.840 --> 53:11.360]  Managing type 2 diabetes in conventional ways is a never-ending task.
[53:11.360 --> 53:13.720]  But this good news may also surprise you.
[53:13.720 --> 53:19.400]  A recent UCLA study proved that type 2 diabetes can be reversed in only 21 days.
[53:19.400 --> 53:23.640]  Purium Health Products recently developed a product that mimics the healthy diet used
[53:23.640 --> 53:28.240]  in that UCLA study called Scoop of Greens, an easy, great tasting, affordable way to
[53:28.240 --> 53:32.280]  give your body the nutritional tools to help it overcome type 2 diabetes.
[53:32.280 --> 53:36.240]  Scoop of Greens has been awarded the Diabetes Resource Center's Seal of Approval so you
[53:36.240 --> 53:37.240]  know it's safe.
[53:37.240 --> 53:40.840]  See Scoop of Greens and other world-class whole living foods and nutraceuticals at

[54:08.000 --> 54:11.600]  I want to thank everybody that's made these Google searches successful.
[54:11.600 --> 54:14.240]  Feds radiating Americans, let's make it number one.
[54:14.240 --> 54:17.240]  Usually takes about three hours.
[54:17.240 --> 54:23.440]  I was just given a medical daily article and this is one of the biggest areas of research
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.600]  is anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug addiction vaccines.
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.960]  They lower IQ, they attack the synapses, the receptors in the brain, it's on record.
[54:32.960 --> 54:33.960]  Here it is.
[54:33.960 --> 54:40.200]  It's learning and memory and mice and all these big universities, the Pentagon, they're
[54:40.200 --> 54:45.800]  studying the genes CA2 similar to humans where they can lower the IQ and erase the
[54:45.800 --> 54:49.040]  memories of mice with one succulent injection.
[54:49.040 --> 54:54.320]  Of course the US IQ is dropped depending on the region, 10 to 20 points, fluoride does
[54:54.320 --> 54:58.280]  that alone.
[54:58.280 --> 55:04.680]  And people probably can't even help themselves right now, I mean I'm here telling you the
[55:04.680 --> 55:07.840]  radiating your houses, I'm here telling you the poison in your water and a lot of people
[55:07.840 --> 55:14.000]  are like you're so mesmerized by the television, by all of it you don't care.
[55:14.000 --> 55:18.880]  And there's all these political prostitutes who sell out their whole society, their family.
[55:18.880 --> 55:21.120]  Look there's no selling out to this.
[55:21.120 --> 55:24.760]  When it's done and set up it's going to kill us.
[55:24.760 --> 55:27.960]  I had a top researcher on who was one of the only people to ever be given access to the
[55:27.960 --> 55:31.880]  Rand Corporation's internal documents and it was all world government total domination,
[55:31.880 --> 55:34.040]  dumbing us down total enslavement.
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.320]  The end of the family, funding wars, staging terror attacks, I mean what do you think all
[55:39.320 --> 55:41.680]  of this is about?
[55:41.680 --> 55:43.000]  What do you think this is?
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.240]  What do you think hiring the Stasi is?
[55:45.240 --> 55:48.440]  What do you think training kids to tattle on mommy is?
[55:48.440 --> 55:51.760]  It's pure evil.
[55:51.760 --> 55:57.520]  Deleting a certain gene and mice can make them smarter by unlocking a mysterious region
[55:57.520 --> 56:00.320]  of the brain considered to be relatively inflexible.
[56:00.320 --> 56:02.720]  Scientists at Emory University School of Medicine have found.
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.560]  But then the government, it goes on, is studying how to turn it off.
[56:06.560 --> 56:11.920]  Mice with the disabled RGS-14 gene are able to remember objects they've explored and
[56:11.920 --> 56:17.000]  learned to navigate mazes better than regular mice, suggesting RGS-14's presence limits
[56:17.000 --> 56:21.120]  some of the learning and memory.
[56:21.120 --> 56:24.680]  The results were published online this week in the early edition of Proceedings of the
[56:24.680 --> 56:27.760]  National Academy of Sciences.
[56:27.760 --> 56:34.360]  The RGS-14 receptors to hold mice back mentally, John Hepler, PhD professor of pharmacology
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.200]  at Emory University School of Medicine, and all these scientists are good people and most
[56:38.200 --> 56:39.200]  of them are.
[56:39.200 --> 56:40.200]  They're just hired.
[56:40.200 --> 56:41.960]  They develop the thing to, oh, let's unlock the mind.
[56:41.960 --> 56:45.960]  And the government's like, hmm, we could turn the mind off with this.
[56:45.960 --> 56:52.200]  And what is Wired Magazine report that Marshall, the head futurist there, at Net Assessment
[56:52.200 --> 56:58.040]  Office says, oh, they're already testing amnesics on the troops after something bad to erase
[56:58.040 --> 56:59.040]  their memory?
[56:59.040 --> 57:07.320]  Halcyon's one of the drugs.
[57:07.320 --> 57:08.480]  This just goes on and on.
[57:08.480 --> 57:14.000]  These people, these people, oh, heaven help me.
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.400]  And then I've got this report right here.
[57:16.400 --> 57:23.200]  This creator slams Blight of Web, disconnection laws, Tim Berners-Lee, the man credited with
[57:23.200 --> 57:27.480]  inventing the World Wide Web, warned of the Blight of New Laws being introduced across
[57:27.480 --> 57:29.800]  the globe, allowing people to be cut off from the Internet.
[57:29.800 --> 57:34.560]  There's been a rash of laws trying to give governments and Internet service providers
[57:34.560 --> 57:38.400]  the right and the duty to disconnect people, he told a conference of Web science at the
[57:38.400 --> 57:39.520]  Royal Society in London.
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.520]  The current Blight includes French law that comes into effect this year that threatens
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.000]  to cut people off with the illegally downloaded from the Internet, and a new British law passed
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.120]  in April, which could see similar action.
[57:48.120 --> 57:52.280]  There's no judge, no jury, they just do it, including shutting down whole websites.
[57:52.280 --> 57:56.120]  If a French family can be forcibly disconnected from the Internet by a law for a year, because
[57:56.120 --> 57:59.720]  one of their children downloaded something that a company asserts with no proof that
[57:59.720 --> 58:05.280]  they should not have downloaded without trial, I think that's kind of inappropriate punishment.
[58:05.280 --> 58:09.440]  He added, I'd like to go on using the Internet if it gets cut off, or for some reason, oh,
[58:09.440 --> 58:13.360]  I don't have the second part of the article, did you guys print me that?
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.080]  Internet successor slams Blight of Web disconnection laws.
[58:17.080 --> 58:18.080]  That's coming up.
[58:18.080 --> 58:20.280]  We got Mark Dice at the aid after.
[58:20.280 --> 58:24.160]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[58:24.160 --> 58:29.320]  Our websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, where we're simulcasting a live video right now, and
[58:29.320 --> 58:32.440]  infowars.com, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[58:32.440 --> 58:37.120]  But the search term we need to get out to everybody, ladies and gentlemen, is key.
[58:37.120 --> 58:44.120]  It's radiating Americans, stay with us.
[59:07.120 --> 59:12.480]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[59:12.480 --> 59:14.320]  expanded nationwide.
[59:14.320 --> 59:19.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[59:19.000 --> 59:20.320]  shadow state.
[59:20.320 --> 59:24.840]  At least state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[59:24.840 --> 59:28.880]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[59:28.880 --> 59:34.680]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[59:34.680 --> 59:38.200]  That's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[59:38.200 --> 59:40.240]  The police state isn't coming.

[59:53.240 --> 01:00:05.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:10.120]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.120]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.480]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:33.200]  Now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:39.640]  Coming up in the third hour, we're going to have wide open phones specifically for people
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:44.400]  running naked body scanners, TSA folks, Homeland Security, private contractors driving around
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:49.320]  with these mobile vans, looking through your houses, making your family drive through these.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:53.120]  We've had radiologist engineers on talking about how powerful this radiation is and how
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.960]  deadly the mobile trucks at least 10 times that of a chest x-ray.
[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:01.000]  I want to hear from you.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.680]  Are you concerned about the radiation you're getting?
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.800]  Do you think about how this violates the Fourth Amendment?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.080]  Or are you on too big of a power trip because you've got a security clearance to call into
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]  the show?
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.080]  A security clearance spying on the American people without warrants.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.080]  When you stink and break.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080]  It's only legal.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:22.400]  In fact, if you call in during Mark Dice, we'll get to you.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.400]  We'll do it right now.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.400]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.400]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:33.800]  I've been covering it a lot in the last hour.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.760]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.080]  We're doing the web search today.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.040]  I hope you'll help us with this.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.760]  You are our only hope to get this out.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:51.880]  Feds radiating Americans at internal checkpoints, search term, feds radiating Americans.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.400]  And they've got illegal checkpoints.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.360]  This is WSBTV.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:00.960]  Counter-terror operation stops trucks on I-20, runs them through the radiators.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.680]  I mean, there it is.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.400]  Not just a violation of the Fourth Amendment, but radiation.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400]  It's insane.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.640]  I'm done ranting about that for now.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.400]  Coming up later in the hour, we're going to premiere the InfoWars version of What in
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:28.120]  the World Are They Spraying, a great new documentary produced by G. Edward Griffin that went on
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.600]  pre-sale yesterday at infowars.com.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.600]  We're going to have it first.
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.840]  We'll be shipping it out to you October 22nd, about 23, 24 days from now.
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.360]  You want to get it first.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.760]  Beautiful film, document and chemtrails.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760]  It's declassified.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.800]  It's just a hidden and plain view.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.680]  Very interesting, very informative, What in the World Are They Spraying, available at
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:58.120]  infowars.com or by calling toll 3888-2533139-888-2533139 and your purchase of the different books

[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.640]  In fact, where did my four end games go?
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:10.240]  I had four end games sitting here.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:18.360]  We are ending this special tomorrow, so if you want to take advantage of it, 1995 for
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:25.120]  the Obama deception, 1995 for this seminal film exposing the left-right paradigm and
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.120]  the globalist agenda, biggest film we've ever made.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.280]  Get it on DVD, make copies, get it out to everyone you know, and get a free copy of
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:40.880]  Jesse Ventura's American Conspiracies Free 2495 Value in Hardcover.

[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:49.320]  It's a great book, covers 14 different documented conspiracies, 9-11, JFK, the list goes on

[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:07.840]  That's prisonplanet.tv, that's prisonplanet.tv.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.960]  But this, this tyranny is closing in on us, but the good news is people are waking up
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:19.280]  all over the world, austerity, anti-austerity protests sweep across Europe as they cut off
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.080]  people's welfare, take part of their pension funds, raise taxes, everything goes to the
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.600]  central bankers.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:32.480]  Meanwhile, Gates Buffett hosts Banquet for China's super rich, French budget makes historic
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:42.680]  spending cuts, Obama the Liberals is inexcusable to stay on election sidelines and Kerry goes
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:47.240]  further saying they're too stupid to know that globalism is good for them, that's all
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.240]  coming up.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.320]  We're going to get into the attack on the internet and free speech as well, it is all
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.760]  coming up straight ahead on the other side of this break, Mark Dice, I'll be joining
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:01.120]  us today with us.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.280]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.000]  with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.840]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.520]  anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:21.280]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.880]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:30.520]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.040]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:41.920]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:49.200]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.320]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:06:01.200]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.480]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:12.840]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:13.840]  at home.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:19.000]  I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  shards.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:30.280]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.000]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.360]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:47.400]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.720]  of the Republic.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.280]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.800]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.080]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.400]  allows you to have.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:20.120]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:24.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.440]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:31.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:35.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.560]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:08:00.440]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:26.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.320]  We are back live.
[01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:30.920]  We're going to be talking in this hour and the next about the internet's creator, and
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:37.200]  no, it's not Al Gore, the true internet creator in the French news agency saying governments
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:45.880]  are killing the web as we know it, openly saying that the web is dying, being shut down.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.160]  And that is what's happening.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:53.680]  The designer, the main scientist credited with bringing it all together, is telling you this,
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.320]  okay, so the denial needs to be over on this issue.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:04.720]  We're going to get into the huge fact that at least 500 vans with high-powered radiation
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.160]  are violating your Fourth Amendment and hitting you with radiation, scanning your house while
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:09.160]  you're in it.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]  You've got a key report.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:15.240]  They've now got highway checkpoints radiating people as they drive through them.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.880]  The cops are all just standing out there right outside the radiation projector as the truck
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.240]  drives on drip, being hit themselves with it.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:26.160]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.600]  It's people literally killing themselves in slow motion, and it's a soft kill, so when
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:36.240]  they die 10, 15 years down the road, it'll be, oh, we wonder why there's such an increase
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.800]  in this cancer or that cancer.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.280]  They've got it all figured out.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:43.640]  We're also going to get into where Mark Dice sees society going.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:49.400]  He's been fighting the New World Order intensely for more than five years, and he's got a unique
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:53.200]  and very thought-provoking perspective, but we see the rise of the Tea Party.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:57.440]  We see world government now being admitted by the globalists as a good thing.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:01.720]  The fake right wing who denied it existed now saying, oh, there's a few problems, low-level
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:08.600]  professors run it, not the Pentagon, the globalist, the Rand Corporation who are on record setting
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:15.280]  up a socialistic, collectivistic world government, this collectivist system.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.280]  And again, we've gone over all these documents.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:22.400]  So many, every week there's new ones like Global Trends 2025 put out by the National
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.920]  Security Council saying they want world government.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:32.440]  Okay, the denial is over, and in this world government, the goal is to set up a control
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.920]  grid and then soft kill you.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.440]  But people are waking up to GMO, so the government's trying to pass laws that you can't label
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.520]  if something's non-GMO.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.240]  They're not going to let you know of salmon's across species with insect genes and eel genes
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.080]  and rabbit genes.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.040]  They're trying to pass laws, you know, where you can't videotape police, but that's being
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.600]  overturned.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.080]  Humanity is fighting back.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.880]  For all the bad things that are happening, a lot of good is happening as well.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.040]  Mark Dice from The Resistance, good to have you on with us.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:06.280]  Well, you know, I wish I wouldn't have to do this, but unfortunately I have a big mouth
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:09.120]  and this is just something I have to do.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.080]  People always say to me, well, you know, why is it, do you really believe what you're doing?
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.080]  Why are you doing this?
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.080]  Of course I do.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080]  I mean, I can't not do this.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080]  I'm an angry guy.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.960]  This is the stuff that I talk about amongst my friends, and this is the platform that
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.600]  we use to find like-minded people to come together and people say, are we really doing
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:27.600]  any good?
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:28.600]  We are doing good.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.600]  Look at the things that we've changed.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.360]  Look at the things that we've stopped or minimized, and also there's a micro change
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.200]  as well because when you become aware of these issues, you change.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.000]  You might not even see the change globally, but you yourself change.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Your life changes.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.360]  Your family, your relationships, your finances, your whole priority changes.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:51.520]  So you yourself are then pulled out of the system and in a sense saved from it.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.320]  So I think we're doing a lot of work, and I think that we need to continue.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:58.880]  But there's some really horrific stuff happening and coming down the line.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:06.080]  And I think George Orwell predicted it perfectly in his 1949 book on 1984.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:11.560]  And it's quite scary how the ignorance of the population, the social structure, the
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.160]  control of information, the perpetual state of war.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160]  That's right.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:19.040]  He talks in the book about if we could ever get the general public, the lower classes,
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.480]  the prols who were 90% of the public in that fictional system, but it was based off what
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.800]  he saw in the Soviet Union and what was developing in East Germany.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:33.960]  If you could ever get the general public to not care about sports and lottery tickets,
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:40.840]  you could get the prols to have endless calculations and mathematics about the supposed lottery,
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.640]  but you couldn't get them to notice that Big Brother said they'd always been at war
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.640]  with East Asia.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.680]  And the next day they say they've never been at war with East Asia.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.000]  He said, why won't they stand up?
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.360]  Why won't they wake up?
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360]  And now here we are.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.760]  Now here we are, Mark.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.520]  You know, to quote him, he says here, quote, heavy physical labor, care of the home and
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:06.840]  children, petty quarrels with neighbors, films, football, beer, and above all gambling
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.080]  fill the horizons of their minds.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:11.640]  To keep them in control was not difficult.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:15.600]  All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism, which could be appealed to whenever
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.160]  it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours and shorter ration.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:24.840]  And when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontentment led nowhere
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:30.560]  because being without general ideas, they could only focus on petty grievances.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:34.440]  And that's what Glenn Beck is doing in the final equation.
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.480]  He's admitting much of the world government but claiming it's Obama and some mid-level
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:45.120]  professors, when meanwhile, globalism is billions a year in government payments to
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.480]  Fox TV and news as part of behavior placement, all the networks get it, and the Pentagon
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.280]  and Rand Corporation and Ford Foundation on record have set all this up, including the
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.840]  Soviet Union, the Ford Foundation and others, and the Carnegie before that.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.800]  I mean, it's on record.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800]  They want collectivism.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.040]  That's what globalism is.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:13.120]  But again, McCarthy, he was okay as long as he was blaming low-level file clerks and janitors
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120]  and calling them up.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.480]  But when he found out the Pentagon was running communism and he found out it was a plan to
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.000]  merge our nations, it was over for Joseph McCarthy.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.960]  Well, you had the Pentagon actually funded back in the 70s, the RFID program.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:31.000]  They actually called it the Mark Card, the multi-technical automated reader card, the
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  Mark Card.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.240]  So the Department of Defense funded that, it was tested back again in the 1990s at Ford
[01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:39.440]  Bragg in North Carolina.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.560]  Interesting how the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, all these foundations
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.160]  fund a lot of this stuff.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:51.000]  I found that the top facial recognition software company, Vizionic, was started by a man named
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.640]  Joseph Attic.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:15:00.800]  In 1991, he was actually recruited by Rockefeller University and funded to specifically design
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.160]  the facial recognition.
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.160]  Everything is, Mark.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.840]  We've got stuff from 66 where they said we're going to develop a hormone added to a tetanus
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.840]  shot to sterilize women.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.800]  And the great part is they're still going to be able to get pregnant, but they'll have
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.360]  a miscarriage at the start of the second trimester.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.880]  It's a perfect secret weapon and the added goodie, this is all declassified, is that
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.840]  the miscarriage has killed some of the women.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840]  So it's even better.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:30.360]  Oh, how luscious, I mean, you name it, the Rockefeller Foundation, others funded the
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:36.000]  Rand Corporation, all of them, everything, everything you see they designed.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  It's so incredible how so much of this big brother technology really is just quackery
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.040]  and designed to keep everybody intimidated not to detect any terrorist.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.440]  Let's look at this plan to put microphones and cameras in the plane seats in the European
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.440]  Union.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.640]  This is actually quite foolish and they're taking it seriously.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.280]  They're looking at funding, they're considering actually implementing it.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.000]  Let's take a look at how effective this would actually be.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.040]  You're telling me that a couple of terrorists are going to be sitting on an airplane and
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.880]  say to the guy next to them, hey, Mohamed, in five minutes, let's hijack this airplane.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.160]  I'll take out the pilot and you make sure to kill the stewardess.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.280]  I mean, it's just absurd that they did it.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.000]  But it's even absurd to even address it as if they're a real terrorist.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.720]  This is to train you that you're going to be watched 24-7.
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.080]  They admit the airports and airplanes are the beta test for the streets, just like the
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:28.920]  naked body scanners are now rolling out on the streets.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.160]  You might be aware that some of the listeners might be aware of this.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.360]  There's a program that's been in testing since 2006 in Holland and may actually implement
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.400]  it in London for the 2012 Olympics, where the cameras are not only now going to watch
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:45.360]  you, they're going to listen to and record conversations from 100 yards away and analyze
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:50.080]  the speech to determine if somebody's being hostile.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:55.720]  They're saying that the privacy laws will allow this in Holland and probably in England.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:01.120]  Again, yeah, this is just to design an intimidation factor to keep you in line.
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.520]  But you don't even think about questioning the system because you're going to get worried
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.200]  that something is going to happen to you, that the government's going to hear you, you're
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.360]  going to get arrested, you're going to get audited, something bad's going to happen to
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.360]  you.
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:15.920]  You better shut up and stay in your house and watch TV, which your TVO is actually tracking
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.440]  what you're watching and doing and reporting it back.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.560]  But actually three years ago, all over England, they put up cameras that have a mean-looking
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:28.400]  face on them with a TV screen that when you talk too loud or do something, it screams
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.880]  orders at you.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:35.520]  So the actual TV screen, and as you know, six years ago, they put up posters all over
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:40.640]  London with an all-seeing eye saying, safe under the eye of Big Brother.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.640]  So they're coming out and saying 1984 is good.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.920]  Yeah, remember there's a 1993 film demolition man with the Vestor Stallone and there were
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:54.520]  these devices listening all over and if somebody were to say a bad word, the device would hear
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.920]  them and actually charge them a fine.
[01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:01.080]  And we're actually coming to that, and again, it's fascinating to see how George Orwell
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.080]  predicted all this.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:05.720]  I want to throw another quote out there from him again from his 1949 book.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.040]  This book was written before VCRs, microwaves, color television, but yet he foresaw, quote,
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.160]  the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously any sound that Winston made above the level
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.560]  of a whisper would be picked up by it.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.200]  Moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision, within the metal plaque
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.040]  commanded, he could be seen as well as heard.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.280]  You had to live, did live, from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:37.760]  sound you made was overheard and except in darkness, every moment, scrutinized.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:44.720]  And now I don't have computers in my bedroom, I have to turn my iPhone off and put it away,
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.920]  and because I'm aware of the total surveillance, I'm already living like Winston Smith.
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:51.320]  I mean, do you ever catch yourself doing that, Mark?
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:55.960]  I have a piece of black tape, taped over the camera on my laptop, and I had this up there
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:00.240]  before this case broke of the students being spied on by their school.
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.120]  And I had friends of mine laugh at me and they said, oh, hello, the government's going
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]  to be watching you.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:07.360]  And then I emailed them the article of the school that was spying on the students on
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:10.240]  their laptop when they were at home.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.320]  And the judge ruled that's okay.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.720]  There were tens of thousands of videos and images of them dressing, undressing, showering,
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:21.400]  and it all broke because a kid was eating Skittles and the school called them in and
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.360]  said, we saw you taking drugs.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.000]  They were watching them in their bedrooms and they even released on the news images
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.160]  of teenagers asleep in their beds and the government said, it's good.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.160]  It's good.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:37.160]  There's some very disturbing GPS systems coming out.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.760]  Actually, one of them is already on the market now to start training the little kids when
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.840]  they're three, four, five years old, that this is how society is.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:48.120]  They're constantly watched, mom and dad constantly listen to you.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.360]  You might have seen this.
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.520]  There's a device called the Amber Alert.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.760]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.760]  Stay there.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:57.560]  Meanwhile, Dinecore kidnaps literally hundreds of thousands of men, women and children that's
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560]  in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.560]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.240]  What is a wind generator?

[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:10.640]  You heard me right, the GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S. economy, its debt, and the
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.880]  current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:17.920]  With the debt to GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.840]  rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:27.200]  The federal debt and risk of financial crises document the CBO has published is a must read
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.720]  for every American.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.800]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.480]  interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.520]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:46.480]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:52.640]  Again call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:23:00.480]  Once again you need to read this government report, call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:04.600]  Is your computer running slowly thinking about buying a new one?
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.680]  Don't waste your money.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:11.080]  Your computer could be infected with spyware, malware, viruses, registry errors, spam,
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]  and pop-ups.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.720]  You don't need to buy a new computer.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.240]  Just go to DoubleMySpeed.com and find out what's slowing your computer down.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.920]  Double My Speed totally cleaned up my system and increased my speed.

[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:10.480]  It's DoubleMySpeed.com.
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:15.280]  Mark Dice.com is the website.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.920]  He's written multiple books.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.920]  We carry them all at infowars.com.
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:24.600]  They're excellent, including one title, The Illuminati and The Resistance.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:29.720]  I know we've got a lot of callers who are military, radiologists, TSA, and we're going
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.680]  to take your calls coming up in the next segment and I'll keep Dice a little bit in the next
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:35.320]  hour as well because he's got so much to talk about.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:41.720]  But Mark, do you agree with me that the global architects, the social engineers know there's
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.720]  an awakening?
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.200]  In fact, Mr. Binkie Brzezinski admits that.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.240]  The greatest awakening, he calls it.
[01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:50.680]  And so they're trying to bum rushes and just get everything in place right now because
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.880]  Google's coming out and saying we can predict the future.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.400]  We're tracking everything you do.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.400]  We are evil.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.400]  We are the government.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:25:01.320]  I mean, they're just everywhere admitting all of this now, Mark.
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:08.320]  Yeah, and the consensus is to still make us feel like we're the weirdos, we're quackery.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.720]  But I mean, let's look at this technology that they say that's supposedly going to predict
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.720]  all this stuff.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:18.000]  It is largely quackery, the mind scanners supposedly being able to read your mind and
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.080]  tell if you've had experiential knowledge of things.
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:26.640]  This is all coming in the next, probably 10 to 15 years.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640]  And it's so scary.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.680]  I mean, before the break, I was mentioning this new GPS device that's about the size
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:36.080]  of a 50 cent piece that parents are catching onto their children.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.400]  And it just shows on their cell phone where their little two-year-old is at all times
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.320]  and it also has a microphone in it so they can use their cell phone to listen to their
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.560]  child to see what he's talking about.
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.440]  And this is all just becoming normal and Facebook, of course, has just caused everybody to fall
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:57.920]  in love with Big Brother, telling them what they do, think and feel where they're at at
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.920]  any particular moment.
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:05.280]  But, Mark, entire public schools are fitting all the kids with RFID and, in some cases,
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.520]  the GPS trackers.
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.080]  And now, for unpaid parking tickets, they're going to make you wear an enclet bracelet.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:17.000]  Yeah, and the funny thing is, is most people now using Facebook with over 500 million users
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:23.400]  are willingly handing over their deepest thoughts, all of their personal information, their family
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:29.560]  members, where they work, that the social implications just on that alone are immense.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:35.440]  And I put out a press release a couple weeks ago trying to urge people to log off of Facebook
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.440]  for a week.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.440]  I called it Facebook Free Week.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:41.040]  I got a little flack even from some of the movement.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.040]  People think, oh, this is 9-11.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.760]  Look, there's more to the New World Order than the Big Brother, the economy, the police
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.760]  state terrorism.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.160]  There's a whole social aspect of it as well.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:57.240]  And if we are turning ourselves, our society, into a bunch of self-absorbed narcissists,
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.600]  not focusing on real events, but just on what I'm doing, look at what's happened in the
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.280]  last few years with Facebook.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.040]  Every day, millions of people post multiple times a day what it is that they're doing
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.600]  as if the world literally revolves around them.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.160]  Oh, I just had a great breakfast.
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:13.560]  I just had a good latte.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.480]  It's a beautiful morning today.
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.840]  I'm going to go here.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.840]  Oh, I'm doing here.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.560]  Look at my new picture of myself.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.640]  Don't I look really pretty?
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640]  It's fascinating.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.960]  And it's probably me that's saying this.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:26.840]  I started noticing this even amongst my actual friends.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:33.080]  I put out Facebook Free Week, and then immediately I started seeing these real studies from universities,
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.280]  the University of Michigan, York University, and Canada.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:42.000]  And they're confirming this that society is becoming extremely narcissistic, less empathetic
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.560]  than they were 20 or 30 years ago.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.640]  And it's worse than that, the vocabulary, as Orwell wrote about, the object of Ingsock
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.680]  was to destroy words, limit vocabulary to just say double plus good, to where someone
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:00.200]  can't even communicate to you complex thoughts because you don't have the semantical symbols
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:07.520]  in your mental lexicon, orthosaurus, to be able to even understand what they're saying.
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.520]  And the Buffalo News reported that, oh yeah, the police are getting all this data mined
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.400]  in Facebook, Google stuff to, quote, predict what you're doing, pre-crime.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.720]  Yeah, that's probably coming down.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.200]  It's so, so scary now.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:24.920]  I mean, we have Orwell here said, it's terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.040]  you were in a public place within the range of a telescreen.
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.560]  The smallest thing could give you away a nervous tick, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.560]  of muttering to yourself, anything that carried the suggestion of abnormality, of having something
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:41.280]  to hide.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.600]  And now they're putting the telescreens in that both receive and transmit and they say,
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:51.960]  if you look unhappy or you're sweating, that's the evidence they need to take you away.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:57.120]  There was a case in India of a woman being convicted of murder, actually, from a brain
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:02.800]  scan that said that she had experiential knowledge of the crime scene.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:09.480]  So now they're developing these devices, they're called functional MRIs, fMRIs, that allegedly
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:15.280]  believe, or at least they're purporting them, to be able to detect in your mind whether
[01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:23.840]  you have been somewhere or whether you have actually seen something or heard something.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.240]  And we know that this is all going to start becoming standard operating procedure.
[01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:33.680]  And lie detectors aren't even allowed in a court of law because they're not completely
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.840]  accurate, it's largely quackery.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.040]  And there's a whole nother angle to this, all these big defense department affiliated
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:46.520]  companies, they're getting these trillions and trillions of contracts over the decades,
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:51.120]  so they're also profiting from enslaving us, stay with us.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:59.080]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:04.720]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.000]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  owned and operated American company.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.800]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:18.440]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:22.480]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.480]  anywhere.
[01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:32.040]  Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.

[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:42.840]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:46.880]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:57.960]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091, visit our website, 5starsoap.com, for buying a one to two month

[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.680]  Check them out today.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.800]  Listen up friends, this is Alex Jones with key information.
[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.720]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.520]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:14.920]  You need to get your own supply of high quality, storeable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:19.320]  They're the best company out there, the longest continually operating with a ton of great
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.840]  food to choose from.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:24.800]  It's all fresh and made on a monthly basis, not some old, cruddy food they're selling
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.520]  you like some of the other guys.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:30.960]  Try their new evacuation pack, a two week supply of delicious, easy to fix food.
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:34.880]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it, with open talk of a strike on
[01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.600]  Iran the next three months.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:41.640]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:44.040]  The place to go is eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:51.800]  Go to their website online right now, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:33:02.040]  Again on the web, eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex, or give them a call at 800-409-5633.
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:08.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.480]  The attempt to shut down the Internet as we know it is now out in the open, even a French
[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.800]  news agency quoting the creator of the Internet, and again it's not Al Gore, saying they are
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.880]  in the process of shutting the web now.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.600]  The denial is over.
[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.600]  That is coming up.
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.920]  I want to get into the economy as well.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.360]  I've got the new infowars.com trailer for what the world are they spraying.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:39.880]  Chemtrail documentary now on preorder at infowars.com.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.640]  Coming out October 22nd, if you want to preorder it now, that's not far away.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.040]  Get your orders in because they'll be shipped out in the order they're received, and we've
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:52.600]  got this other special running in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the seminal film on
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:55.600]  the eugenics master plan.
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.000]  Almost three hours long, very well done.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.120]  I think this is my most important film.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.920]  Four copies, $19.95.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.320]  Buy one, get three free basically.
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.360]  And your purchase does also support the broadcast, but this film is so important.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:09.560]  All my films are so important.
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:11.920]  They're free on YouTube and Google and other places.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.480]  They're not anywhere near this quality, but get those links if you can't afford them,
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:16.480]  send them out to people.
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.280]  You can buy the DVDs, get the links on YouTube, just Google in-game, and send it out to everyone
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.280]  you know.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:26.640]  They need to understand what the eugenics and the population reduction and what Bill
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:31.000]  Gates is talking about when he says, don't give grandma's treatment, let her die.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.720]  We can hire 10 teachers.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.920]  Once they collectivize things fully, which they're almost there, then they're going
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:40.520]  to tell the public, you know, take their money, you get to have it, but really it goes to
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.520]  the bankers.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:45.360]  I mean, even if you're immoral and want to rob somebody, are you stupid enough to think
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.720]  you're going to be getting it?
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:50.440]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement, DVD at the online video bookstore, shopping
[01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:55.640]  cart, infowars.com, the special ends next week.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:35:00.040]  Going back to Mark Dice, I was looking at the front page of markdice.com.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:05.440]  We'll put it up on screenforprisonplanet.tv viewers.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:13.000]  You've got, you can just search the term monkeys with brain chips, you know, monkeys in medical
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.500]  test for decades.
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:19.440]  I mean, I remember 25 years ago, seeing Scientific American reporting on remote-controlled cockroaches
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.080]  with just one little microchip, who I think is even more amazing than Eric Blair, aka
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.520]  George Arwell, was, of course, Aldous Huxley.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.120]  He wrote in 32, Brave New World, and before he died in 62, he said, this is actually what
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.120]  we're planning.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.880]  And his brother, of course, ran UNESCO at the UN at the time.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.960]  People read that book and they go, this is what's happening now.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:42.760]  Well, that's how advanced their technologies are.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.440]  We'll put that monkey back up on screen for folks, if they're not watching, prisonplanet.tv,
[01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:51.440]  go to markdice.com and look at it.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:55.120]  But that's basically how the globalists see humans.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:58.880]  Finish up your point about narcissism, because people say, well, hey, it is all about me.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.320]  Yeah, but once everybody is like that, then no one cares about anybody else.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.680]  And you were talking about all the studies showing people have lost their empathy.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:12.600]  Sometimes I'll go review a movie because I've got to go watch it, you know, to review it.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.520]  It's full of violence and death and kids being killed.
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:20.240]  And the audience laughs and giggles and enjoys it because they're being desensitized.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.600]  And the major studies and brain scans show they then can't differentiate real things.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.600]  People now laugh at car accidents when someone's head cut off.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:33.600]  They now see a woman, you know, famous case in Toronto a few years ago, being raped in
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.080]  the main street, beaten with a lead pipe.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.240]  And for two plus hours, no one helped her.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.560]  And the boss at one telecommunications company, it was in the news, told his employees, I
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.840]  don't call the police.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:46.280]  We don't have time to even deal with them.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:47.280]  Letter bleed.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.920]  Everyone giggled and felt official and powerful.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.880]  And that's what yuppies do.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:54.560]  You know, you warn them about, hey, these naked body scanners, you know, they're recording
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.160]  them at Bayesian radiation.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.280]  And they just go, nah, I'm not sure.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:03.200]  Well, it's interesting that Facebook and MySpace, these sites are called social and networking
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.200]  sites.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:09.480]  But really they are social isolation sites because they supplement in an artificial way
[01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:13.280]  actual friendships and actual relationships.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.920]  And again, some people attack me for talking about this, but I take a holistic approach
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:21.240]  to fighting the New World Order, not just 9-11, the police, the big brother, the family
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:26.000]  relationships, interpersonal relationships have a lot to do with it because that maintains
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.400]  the fabric of society.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:34.760]  So we have these Facebook pages of people that feel that they log on every day and they
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.600]  feel that they're so important, that they're the star of their own reality show, and they
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.760]  need to tell the world about what it is that they're doing or some random witty thought.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.320]  And the site, I believe, tricks people into feeling that they're actually interacting
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.800]  with their quote unquote friends.
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.160]  Of course, many of them are not even friends, not even really acquaintances, just random
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.040]  people they've met maybe once that have been cyber stalked them and sent them a friend
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.040]  request.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.680]  But it's fascinating to see how, if you log on to Facebook every day, as most people
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:07.280]  do, and your mind is tricked into believing that you have these people in your life,
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.840]  if you can see a status update, a picture, your brain is tricked into thinking that they're
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:11.840]  actually in your life.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:12.840]  But they're not.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.280]  Go and have dinner, go have taco Tuesdays, go have some drinks with them, have a barbecue,
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:19.840]  have some people over, have your real friends over.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.680]  It's unbelievable how Facebook has taken over.
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:31.280]  There's so many other implications to Facebook, big brother aspects-wise, selling your photographs.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:37.160]  We wonder how when Elliot Spitzer's hooker scandal broke, all of a sudden her photo and
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:41.400]  her family photos were all over the news, how did that happen?
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.000]  Well, because they were on MySpace.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.160]  If you read the contract that you enter into, the Terms of Service on MySpace or Facebook,
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.520]  they own your photos.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.800]  You are licensing the photos to them.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.840]  There's also just countless instances of the police posing as beautiful girls and sending
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.600]  college students a friend request on Facebook and then going through their photos and finding
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:09.200]  pictures of them with alcohol and then arresting them for underage drinking.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.000]  So go on and love, love big brother, see what it's doing for you.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:22.600]  Well, I tend to agree with you overall, Mark, but it's just like the Matrix.
[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.400]  You've got to jack into the Matrix to reach people, but I think we should go on Facebook
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:32.960]  and MySpace as I've done and criticize the system and point out what's happening.
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.440]  I mean, it's like iPhones and cell phones.
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:40.400]  Since 1996, we knew from the Telecommunications Act that they track you in real time.
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:41.400]  They listen to you.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.400]  They dial in.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:45.640]  Google has the patents in your home computer five years ago.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.280]  They're watching you at home over the camera and you tell people this and they just can't
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:54.840]  believe it because it's so over the top, but it's admitted and then Google says, well,
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:58.680]  it's computers that are watching you and listening to you and logging keywords.
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.760]  So it's okay, but then humans at Google have access to that.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:05.120]  I'm not saying Facebook is bad.
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.160]  You shouldn't use it, but I use it and you use it.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:14.440]  A lot of people use it to get out information, valuable news information, social criticism,
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.440]  things like that.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.680]  And it even does have its social functions amongst your friends.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.960]  But Mark, let me be clear.
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.240]  I'm not criticizing you saying it's wrong what you're saying.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:28.440]  I 110% agree with you and it's also who runs the platform.
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.200]  We know Facebook's a government front.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.200]  We know Google is an admitted government front.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.520]  We know that, you know, they call their people dumb idiots or they actually use cuss words
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:38.760]  who trust them.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.560]  We know they're doing that.
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:45.980]  I'm saying something more like meetup though, where it is about getting together and then
[01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:49.480]  organizing through that medium and then hitting the streets.
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:55.280]  I think that's the key is to go on Facebook, MySpace, all these systems and to use it.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:59.440]  That's why coming up October 13th or October 14th, it's done.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.440]  We're doing it.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.400]  It's taken a year to do.
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.240]  It's just as good or even better than Facebook.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:09.320]  But with our system, you basically have to give us anything, you know, to sign up except
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:10.320]  for an email address.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.080]  We can turn it off if they post porn or anything.
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.040]  You know, it's going to be a clean site, you know, turn off their page, but we're going
[01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:19.520]  to have a system to get people together.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.160]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.680]  We had a little cheat program that was easy to use.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:27.040]  It got about 27,000 members.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.920]  It was the info or social network.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.640]  People ran their own scripts.
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:31.640]  It crashed.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:35.680]  You know, this system we've got is a thousand times, literally more robust and won't be having
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:37.520]  that problem.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.960]  But so many people said they met their wife or their husband through it.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.520]  I went to the UFC because I was invited to it and I went to the UFC in Austin.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:54.040]  I had two separate couples come up, great-looking couples who met over the info or social network
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:57.600]  of only 27,000 people because it didn't work very well.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:03.760]  So, there's going to be videos on this, announcements, I'm going to say, don't just try to get a
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.000]  bunch of friends here.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.840]  We're going to have areas for folks that are into the Second Amendment, folks that are
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.000]  into land rights, people that are into non-GMO and gardening.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.640]  We're going to have places, you know, for people to socially get together.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:17.920]  We're not going to call it dating, but it's going to be, hey, you want to make a boiling
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:18.920]  league?
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.400]  You want to, you know, you know, find other patriots.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.600]  That's why I'm so excited about this.
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.320]  Use their matrix system to reach them.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:31.680]  Here's another example, as I was saying earlier, the iPhone mark is a tool of dehumanization
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:32.680]  and enslavement.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.280]  You know, it's the computer you take around with you, a whole database of what you've
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:37.280]  done.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.240]  People then say, well, why do you have a iPhone app?
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.280]  Because we're going into the matrix with the free iPhone app that even if you don't
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.400]  have an iPhone, you go get the free app link at infoworks.com.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.200]  You send it to everyone you know, and now they can just click one little button and
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.200]  hear the show wherever they are and get access to the free podcast and the rest of it.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:59.000]  So, so there's the example of what I'm saying.
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000]  iPhones are bad.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.640]  They're designed to control you, designed to surveil you.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:05.840]  The government can just flip the camera on in it and watch whatever you're doing and
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:06.840]  listen to you.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:07.840]  They admit it.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.560]  So pretty soon that'll probably be considered.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.800]  You probably won't have any reasonable expectation of privacy.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:17.040]  I wouldn't be surprised if they change the laws in the new world order that says that
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.480]  well, if you're, you know, within talking distance of your cell phone, you really, you
[01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.640]  don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:29.200]  So you'll have data mining systems like Ashelon just constantly listening to everyone.
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.120]  It's, it's quite incredible.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.800]  You know, I agree with you.
[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:37.000]  I use Facebook to get out the word and occasionally it doesn't even have some good social aspects.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.120]  You know, if you want to post a thing and say, hey, we're all going to go down to, you
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:44.400]  know, whatever restaurant tonight if you want to come or it is a way, but it's just
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:50.760]  gotten kind of taken over and that the narcissistic aspects of just run rampant and, and I don't
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:55.560]  know, many people might not even be aware of some of the, some of the other aspects
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:00.200]  of Facebook just opening your whole world up to, I mean, your audience obviously is maybe
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:02.960]  some of the newer audience haven't considered some of these thoughts, but there's a lot
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.800]  of instances of people's homes being burglarized.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.800]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:07.800]  That's huge.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:11.320]  I mean, that's why with our Facebook, it's all our articles and stuff we want people
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320]  to see.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]  Yeah.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.480]  I think that's the main message.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:18.960]  Don't put anything on Facebook that you don't want the whole world to see because here's
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  the deal.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:23.680]  Just everybody maybe be aware of this and we just reinforce this idea.
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.960]  You don't have 500 friends, you don't have 700 friends, these are people that are just
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:31.960]  maybe acquaintances, people you've met once, especially feel sorry for attractive girls
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:36.000]  who just get friend requests after somebody says hello to them essentially and they can
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.240]  track them down because they know who one of their friends are, they just go to their
[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.440]  friend list, find their friend, send the friend request, then the beautiful girl feels rude
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.440]  and she denies them.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.480]  So they, they collect a thousand friends and then these, these people they don't even
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:52.280]  know, haven't met once maybe years ago, now know everything about them, where they live,
[01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:56.520]  where they work, what they do and there's countless aspects of people burglarizing people's homes
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.880]  because they'll just post on there, hey, I'm going to Hawaii for a week or they'll post
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:03.160]  pictures when they're there and then they have their address so that even their, their
[01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:07.040]  quote unquote friends know where they live and so they know that they're gone and go
[01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.760]  and break into their house.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.760]  It's absurd.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:13.400]  So just be careful and you know, it is a double X sort, it can be used.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:16.680]  I have an iPhone, I think it's fantastic for getting email on the go.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.880]  I have a, you know, a video camera with me, if anything happens, I can videotape something.
[01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:26.120]  It does have its use, but let's, let's just, there's also a lot of disinfo on the web.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:31.960]  I've talked to other Alex Joneses because there's probably last count over 15 in Austin
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:37.120]  and they're constantly writing me and saying, please tell people I'm not you, people come
[01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.400]  to my door at night, people, people come to my work, people go to my, my website.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:48.320]  You know, I've gotten calls from Alex Joneses in England and Canada saying, stop it.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:51.760]  You know, you know, tell people I'm not you.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:53.800]  It's incredible, Mark.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:59.240]  You know, there's this Orwellian nightmare is having such dramatic effects and it's
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:01.400]  just getting started because look what happened.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:04.760]  I mean, the iPhone's an incredible piece of technology that's just come out in the last
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:05.760]  few years.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:08.760]  So what's going to come down the road in the next 10 years going to be utterly scary.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.360]  There's instances of gang members, I've seen on the show Ganglamp on the history channel
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.120]  back even before the internet.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:20.800]  Now they're using Facebook and South America to carry out in some cases, multiple hits
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.800]  per day.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:25.440]  Well, what these gang members are doing is they're paying corrupt cops.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.240]  They would get a license plate number of a drug dealer, a competitive drug dealer.
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:33.560]  They'd pay a corrupt cop to run the plates, get their address, they'd go and assassinate
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:34.560]  them.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.520]  So this is just, this is before Facebook.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:41.000]  This just goes to show what can happen when you just tell the world what it is that you're
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:42.920]  doing and you don't even have to be doing anything wrong.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.440]  You could just go on vacation and just post the video.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:48.000]  And the globalists sell this idea if you don't have anything to hide, what are you afraid
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  of?
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.440]  Well, a tyrannical government like Nazi Germany will use that to suppress me.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.600]  Criminals will use that.
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.400]  That's why privacy is so precious.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.440]  It's why we have the Fourth Amendment.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.320]  It's very scary and these Orwellian ideas, we need to confront them right at the run
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:07.120]  in the head as soon as they come up with these ideas, like putting in the scanners and the
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:11.200]  microphones in the EU planes and we need to debunk them for the ridiculous ideas that
[01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:15.120]  they are and show why, even if there were terrorists out there trying to get on these
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.120]  planes, that it wouldn't even work.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:20.440]  Anyway, what's going to happen when, if they put these scanners in these seat planes and
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:24.600]  start listening to us and recording us, somebody's going to have a conversation about the scanner
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:28.000]  themselves and then all those key words are going to be starting to be detected.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.040]  So you're going to be sitting next to somebody and you're going to say, oh, there's the scanner
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.040]  looking for...
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:36.720]  We admit that then goes in the data mining database, the government's keeping all of
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:37.720]  that.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.960]  They're so used to listening to our phones and everything, without warrants, they're
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.640]  like, okay, we're going to record you on the street, we're going to record you in the
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:43.640]  airplane.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.280]  Mark, I've got four callers.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:52.680]  I've got Damon, James, Tim, and Roger, because earlier I said, call in, I'm going to hold
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:56.160]  you over to the next hour if you can do it, but I want to go to some of these calls right
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:01.960]  now on this issue of the mobile house scanners now, 500 of these driving around without
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:08.160]  warrants and bathing people in what is considerably, you know, 10 times or higher than what a
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:09.840]  chest x-ray is.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.720]  So let's go to Tim first, then Damon, James, and Roger.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:18.680]  Tim is a former, he got laid off, a TSA agent.
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:24.320]  Have they warned you guys about the backscatter radiation from the naked body scanners, Tim?
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.000]  Actually, no, sir.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.560]  I called in to tell you about how they laid me off.
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:29.960]  They were doing interviews.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:34.440]  They were telling us that it was for advancement and more pay.
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:39.240]  And they actually gave us a questionnaire on the body scanners.
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:42.520]  I told them that I refused to work around them.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:47.840]  They asked me if I was okay with people going through them, and I said no.
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.840]  Oh, so they're going to find some idiots who will record people's naked bodies and violate
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:56.480]  child porn laws and be bathed in radiation?
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.480]  Yes, sir.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:48:58.480]  I also have one question.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:00.000]  Well, hold on, this is breaking news.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.640]  Let me shut up, because I mean, my brain moves so fast.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.640]  Start over.
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:04.640]  So they get...
[01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.920]  Boy, I wish I could get a copy of that questionnaire.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.480]  Have you heard how they want to make 11,000 TSA with security clearances?
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:14.280]  So they can now, you know, give you disinfo, but then not let you spread it?
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:18.560]  Actually, yes, we have heard about that, too, about security clearances and levels and stuff
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:19.560]  like that.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:20.560]  Okay, well, let's go back then.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:21.560]  When were you given this questionnaire?
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:24.320]  This was back on August 14th.
[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:25.320]  Okay.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:29.840]  And basically, it wasn't a questionnaire, it was like an interview, it was like being
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.320]  interviewed for a job or something.
[01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:35.480]  They took you into the office, we're just letting you know that we're reviewing you,
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:40.920]  and it's for advancement and, you know, security clearance for higher pay, that type of thing.
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:44.440]  And they basically just look at the paper and go down the question, then you answer,
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:46.240]  you know, yes, and why and...
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:48.720]  What kind of questions?
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:59.600]  If you are okay with body scanning Americans, the other question was, was I willing to use
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:04.320]  the body scanners and stand near them and put people through them and stuff?
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.240]  And see, you're smart, but they're going to find morons that are willing to do it.
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:10.760]  And, I mean, they could find a certain percent that would shoot babies in the head if they
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.760]  were told to.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:12.760]  Please continue.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:18.560]  Basically, they just went down the questionnaire and said, okay, you know, we'll let you
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:23.040]  know if you're getting, you know, promoted or whatever.
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:29.520]  And basically, 14 days after that happened, they basically told me that our professional
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.840]  relationship was at an end and they had no more work for me.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:35.880]  I had a really quick question before you let me go.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:36.880]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:37.880]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:42.560]  I want to come back to Tim, then Roger, Damon, James, Mark, Dice of the Resistance is our
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:43.560]  guest.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:48.080]  All three of his great books, The New World Order, Facts and Fiction, The Illuminati and
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:52.920]  of course, The Resistance, the latest editions are available at infowars.com, so you support
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:53.920]  Mark and us when you get them.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.920]  And plus, they're excellent.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.920]  Stay with us.
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:51:02.320]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.280]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.920]  vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:11.960]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:12.960]  or gold?
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:16.320]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.520]  possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:22.680]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:23.680]  seeds.
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:29.000]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.840]  food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:35.040]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:38.660]  you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:22.000]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.080]  But now, many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:29.600]  that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:30.600]  SinoFresh.

[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:26.200]  Okay, finishing up with Chairman Nevada.
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.200]  Mark, we will, this is about 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:32.200]  Coming into the economy, the internet, a lot of other incredible information.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:37.760]  What's happening with the political realignment, the Democrats are cursing their electorate
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:40.040]  for not worshiping them.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:42.280]  So we're going to be discussing that.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:47.320]  But Tim got laid off, basically fired from the TSA.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:50.680]  That's big news if we could document this, I mean, I believe him, but that shows you
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.680]  how this works.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:55.040]  Oh, you don't want to stand next to a radiation system without shielding.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.240]  Oh, you're not an idiot.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:55:00.200]  You know, that's why they won't hire cops now with over a hundred IQ.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.000]  I mean, that's, that's mainstream news.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.080]  They want people that aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer, you know, whose elevator
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.680]  doesn't go all the way to the top.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.280]  And I've told you, we're going to be ruled by a bunch of people whose eyes don't point
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.280]  in the right direction.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.800]  Let's go back to Tim.
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:16.360]  Tim, what was your question?
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.440]  Sir, me and my wife are having a newborn baby and I'm so scared of all these vaccinations
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.760]  and stuff you guys talk about.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:26.320]  And I just wanted to know, you know, I try to talk to my wife and I try to make her
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.480]  listen to the show and stuff.
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:31.840]  And she really loves you, but you know, the thing she, you know, she's had, you know,
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.920]  a baby before and you know, I've had kids from a previous marriage and I really just
[01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:42.160]  want to know what I can give my baby or if there's any website I can go to where it
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.160]  says exactly what.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:46.240]  Well, sir, I mean, we've had Dr. Sherry, 10 pinning on.
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:50.680]  We've had Dr. Russell Blalock top brain surgeon on about how deadly vaccines are.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:51.920]  I have three children.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:53.120]  They've never had a needle in them.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.120]  Okay.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:55.240]  So that'll give you an idea where I'm coming from.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:59.360]  You make your own decision if you're going to put the kid in a daycare with 50 kids jumping
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:02.720]  around, you know, who knows, they might actually get something.
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:06.560]  But if you look at the cost benefit analysis, vaccines clearly cause more problems than
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:07.560]  they help.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.240]  Do I believe that you can get acquired immunity?
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:14.960]  I mean, I know the science of vaccines has some reality to it, but we, I don't just get
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:19.600]  up here and say the globalist are poisoning vaccines because it sounds scary.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:22.360]  I mean, it's all over info wars.com.
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.440]  It's all over prisonplot.com.
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:29.920]  Research Rockefeller foundation, you know, funded vaccines that sterilize.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:38.520]  Uh, I mean, we've got a video, uh, that's two part for sale at info wars.com by Dr.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:39.520]  Sherry 10 penny.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:41.880]  In fact, I'll go over and link to it right now.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.160]  Show that to your wife.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:45.320]  Uh, we've got Dr. Eisensteins.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:52.240]  Don't vaccinate before you educate, uh, book available at info wars.com.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:56.840]  But I mean, almost all of this is just free, uh, on the internet already.
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:02.960]  Uh, I mean, just search this term, England suspends flu shot after increase in fits and
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:07.160]  fits is the British name for convulsions.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:09.280]  And it's a 10 fold increase in convulsions.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.560]  Uh, sir, I mean, if you search info wars every day, you'll see this stuff everywhere.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.520]  It's flu and flu vaccines.
[01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:20.960]  What's coming through the needle, uh, two part DVD info wars.com.
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:23.720]  I mean, does that sound like something that, uh, would help you?
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:24.720]  Uh, yes, sir.
[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.200]  The only thing is that when I come, I, when I come at her with those, she says that it's
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:33.480]  not a needle and it's some kind of liquid or something that they swallow or something.
[01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:40.400]  I mean, I mean, all there is is the, uh, oral polio and you can search the term oral polio
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:42.680]  causes polio CBS news.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:46.760]  Tim, if you want to write us a report about what happened to you, but without using your
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:50.840]  name or if you just want to go public about it, I think that would be a lot of courage
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.520]  to, you know, write a five, 10 paragraph article.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.240]  We'll add research to it and send it to show tips and info wars.com or writers and info
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:57:59.240]  wars.com.
[01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:03.360]  Uh, I'd like the, you know, the news to get out that they're, uh, having internal purges
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:10.160]  within the NKVD T, uh, TSA God bless you, Tim, uh, let's, uh, we're about to go to break
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:11.960]  and I'm going to continue with calls when I want it.
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:16.280]  We got Mark Dyson as a guest, but, uh, I want to hear from him, but briefly, what would
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:19.880]  you say to Tim Mark on the vaccines?
[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:22.880]  You know, I don't, I haven't focused too much on the vaccines.
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:23.880]  That's a personal choice.
[01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:30.080]  I'm just kind of up to my neck and big brother and the secret societies, the police state.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:36.880]  So I would, uh, you know, what was it that Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, they've spoken
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:37.880]  out against them.
[01:58:37.880 --> 01:58:38.880]  There's a lot of other credible sources.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:39.880]  Stay there.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:57.680]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:02.680]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:11.480]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:18.680]  They so pride in every stitch guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:24.680]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:29.600]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:32.080]  We turned jeans inside out.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.400]  Diamond gusset jeans made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.960]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combined gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you could
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:43.120]  ride all day with confidence.
[01:59:43.120 --> 01:59:46.040]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:53.600]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:55.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:05.480]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:10.320]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-offs.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.320]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:13.480]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:17.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:26.600]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:29.360]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.320]  It is hour number three.
[02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.320]  Mark Dice is our guest.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:36.280]  I want to hurry through these calls so we can finish up with Mark and some of the other
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.520]  things he's working on, but I told folks to call in with their concerns about the naked
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:41.720]  body scanners.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:45.240]  The fact that the people running these are being exposed to high levels of radiation.
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:47.920]  That's top scientist on record, New York Times, you name it.
[02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:51.840]  But they just come out and say, that's just the way it is, now blasting your homes with
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:58.480]  mobile vans and mobile checkpoints on the highway, being reported today by WSB TV, counter
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.880]  tear operations, stops trucks on I-20, radiates them, got a key report by Paul Watson, feds
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:07.520]  radiating Americans at internal checkpoints.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.920]  So important to get this PrisonPlanet.com article out to everyone.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:15.880]  Damon, in South Carolina, Radiation Therapist, thanks for holding.
[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:16.880]  Tell us about it.
[02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:17.880]  Yeah.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:22.840]  I'm a medical dosimeters also, and I do treatment planning every day for cancer patients who
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:24.560]  get radiation.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:29.320]  And part of my training, I did take all sorts of radiation biology classes and learn about
[02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:37.840]  the current regs for it and the national counts on radiation protection and measurements.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:42.800]  They say that, as a person who works with radiation, you're only supposed to get an
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:50.920]  annual dose of 50 millisieverts, which is a measurement of both the radiation and then
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:56.600]  the biological effect of the radiation on what part of your body gets exposed or the
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.680]  whole body, for that matter.
[02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:08.200]  And then when you consider that, these are people who work with radiation, and the three-ceever
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:16.920]  okay, has a 50% chance, will kill 50% of all, 50% of people who get reserved receive three-ceavers
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.240]  of dose, will be dead within 30 days.
[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:26.480]  So that's how, I mean, dangerous this constant exposure to radiation is.
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:32.600]  And they admit the cell phones put off microwave radiation and it confirms gives you brain tumors.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:37.720]  This is really the globalist population reduction program is just in bed, radiation emitting
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.880]  devices everywhere and just kill us.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:46.360]  We get exposed to radiation every day from the sun, from, you know, radon gas and other
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:47.360]  natural exposure.
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:49.120]  And that's the main reason we age.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.440]  And that's why on average is about 10 feet of water in the first 30,000 feet of atmosphere.
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.040]  You can't even breathe about after 17,000 feet.
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:01.160]  And that's why it's so dangerous for airline pilots and stewardesses.
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:04.000]  That's why they all basically, even if they're good looking, look like they've been put
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.280]  through a microwave, is because they get the equivalent.
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.280]  What is it?
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:12.160]  Every flight during broad daylight is the equivalent of a chest x-ray.
[02:03:12.160 --> 02:03:15.360]  Basically, but listen to this.
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:20.000]  The number I gave you for someone who works occupational exposure, that's 50 millisieverts
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.500]  annually.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:28.880]  But the public is only allowed to get one millisievert, okay, a five millisievert annually.
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:29.880]  Excuse me.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:33.760]  And how many millisieverts are these naked body scanner technicians getting?
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:38.040]  Well, see, I've never gotten the specs on them, so I don't know what kind of energy
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:39.040]  they're using because it's super detailed.
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.560]  Well, they lied and said that it was one amount, but then even the New York Times had
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:45.640]  to admit 20 to 50 times depending on the machine.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:48.960]  And then you've got these mobile scanners that are just off the charts.
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:53.120]  We've had an engineer slash radiologist designer on.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:58.760]  They said at least 10 times, he knows the units that they're using, 10 times the chest
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:03:59.760]  x-ray.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.640]  Oh, that's not, I mean, that's crazy high.
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:04.760]  Hey, when they die though, they're going to love it.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:05.760]  There's a problem.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:07.720]  The public doesn't wear the badges.
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:12.040]  My coworkers and I, we all have to wear badges that get changed out every month that get
[02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.680]  a report done on them to say.
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:17.720]  There's not any badges and they don't have TSA wearing badges.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.920]  And listen, remember the Pentagon?
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:25.280]  The Pentagon took over 4,000 children, this is on record, and radiated them to death.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.520]  So we're just, they're just killing us.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:31.040]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, sir, you want to write a report for us and go pull up all
[02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.040]  the data.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:34.080]  In fact, I want to get some official radiologist on.
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.080]  That's a prime thing.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:38.720]  We'll get all the numbers on these and do an official report.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:40.880]  But very interesting, Damon.
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:41.880]  You know what?
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.720]  I want Mark Dice to be able to finish up because that's who we have on as a guest, but I want
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.760]  to put you on hold, if you can do it towards the end of the hour to come back and finish
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:51.760]  up talking about this.
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.760]  Okay?
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:53.760]  Absolutely.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.760]  All right.
[02:04:54.760 --> 02:04:55.760]  Mark Dice is our guest.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.760]  We're holding him into this hour.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:04:57.760]  He's sort of going to your calls.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:04:58.760]  We'll get Mark's take on what Damon was just talking about.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.480]  We'll go to James and Roger.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:05.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:09.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:13.800]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.120]  allows you to have.
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:16.120]  That's true.
[02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:20.820]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:25.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.160]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.640]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:36.360]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:41.040]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science.
[02:05:44.880 --> 02:05:46.240]  One of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:50.480]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:52.080]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:01.720]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:05.360]  You've heard me talk about Calden five star subs for years.

[02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:01.520]  Thank you.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:05.240]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:08.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:08.400 --> 02:07:12.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:13.760]  at home.
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:18.920]  We have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:19.920]  shots.
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:24.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:30.480]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:34.880]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.240]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:47.360]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:48.360]  of the Republic.
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:54.760]  Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[02:07:54.760 --> 02:08:05.840]  now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:10.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:11.640]  You want answers?
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:13.840]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:23.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.360]  You know, I could myself just pull up.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:37.240]  We can do it right now, guys, just search the term top, you know, scientist, top radiation
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:45.320]  scientist or radiation scientist says body scanners, serious cancer risk or headline
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:49.880]  body scanners 20 times the radiation previously stated.
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:53.320]  Well, of course, they lie and say they're not saving the image.
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:09:00.480]  Look, folks, they emit serious radiation and you don't see the TSA wearing a lead apron
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:01.480]  even.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:02.480]  Okay?
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:03.480]  You don't see them wearing badges.
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:05.000]  You know, my dad's a dentist.
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.440]  They hide behind a lead wall.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:12.040]  They've got a radiation officer that does it, that has to wear it.
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:13.920]  But notice, see, the globalists just don't care now.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:17.640]  They come out and say, 20 years ago, Army said DU would kill you down in a hammer.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:20.200]  One whiff of it would kill you a decade later.
[02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:24.560]  Now they just say, no problem, troops snored it, roll around in it, don't even wash your
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:25.560]  hands.
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:26.560]  It's great.
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:31.440]  I mean, you know, 10 years ago, even five years ago, they would roll people's trucks
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:32.800]  through the border scanners.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.520]  Now they have the families just go through them.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:40.160]  It's just like the government's gone completely nuts and they're, they're radiating you out
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:41.160]  in the open.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:43.440]  Mark Dice, was that not a chilling call, though?
[02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:49.080]  In fact, we just put the headline up, body scanners could give you cancer, airport body
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:52.920]  scanners that meant radiation up to 20 times more powerful than previously thought, a scientist
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:53.920]  is warned.
[02:09:53.920 --> 02:10:01.560]  And there's so many of these guys out there warning people, but I mean, Mark, I'm speechless.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:06.760]  We need a group of nurses and doctors, Dennis, some sort of, some group in the medical establishment
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:13.440]  to come out and denounce the scanner, to denounce the body scanners at the airport, the mobile
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:18.880]  van, because you know, obviously this guy knows who he's talking about, he's in the field,
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:22.360]  the designers of these things don't even know, don't care, probably don't even think about
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.600]  these sort of repercussions.
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:29.400]  Doctors are so busy, most people in the medical establishment work such long hours, they're
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.640]  not really aware.
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:36.800]  But why are there radiology rules for everything else, but the government's got cops on top
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:39.920]  vehicles going, I love this, I can look right through walls.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:47.400]  I mean, the thing is death star power compared to a pop gun, a regular x-ray is like nothing,
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:54.320]  this is like blasting power, and it's backscattering all over them, if you know about radiology.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:56.800]  Look at Madame Curie, it killed her, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.280]  Oh, there's got to be a way, if there is some sort of, I know there's the recommended amount
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:07.240]  that wants to exceed the certain amount of radiation that's going to be hazardous, there's
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:13.280]  got to be some sort of a law, or someone in a position of power and legal authority has
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:17.280]  got to be able to put forth some sort of a lawsuit in order to stop these, put a freeze
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.840]  to it, get this kind of information out.
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:24.200]  So people like that caller that are aware of things like this, that are aware of your
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:29.680]  show, that are going to be instrumental in the awarding his co-workers, so I don't know
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:32.600]  where people in the medical establishment, but that's probably the only thing it could
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:37.480]  take to get that out, get some authorities on the subject that work in that field to
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:40.360]  come out and denounce how dangerous these are.
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:50.920]  Well, Mark dies expanding on that, the issue here is they are breaking the law because
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:57.800]  they run the system, in fact, I searched the term, body scanners violate child porn laws,
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:03.040]  people get articles from the U.S. and from England, the one place they stood up in Denver,
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:09.640]  they had to stop X-raying, scanning 18 and under, because the point was made, this is
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:15.120]  illegal under state and federal law, so they know it's illegal just on that front.
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:20.280]  There it is, new scanners break child porn laws, London Guardian, they don't care, that's
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:25.000]  what I'm saying, have you seen these federal depositions of the Blackwater people with
[02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:29.800]  the running around naked, snorting giant amounts of cocaine and injecting drugs and smuggling
[02:12:29.800 --> 02:12:33.800]  armaments worldwide, I mean this is just lunatics running things.
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:39.000]  Yeah, I mean I've seen some of that thing, of course there's been some interesting sex
[02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.560]  parties going on with some of the contractors, there's been allegations of women being raped,
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:51.640]  abused, all sorts of these things, it's not that surprising, again, turning back to Orwell
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:57.280]  here, it says if there was hope that they'd lies with the Poles, because they are in those
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:13:03.400]  swarming disregarded masses, 85% of the population, and could the force that destroy the party
[02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:09.160]  ever be generated, but the Poles, if not the Poles rather, if only they could somehow become
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:14.320]  conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire, if they would choose,
[02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:17.720]  they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning.
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:23.200]  But the party sits up there in fancy suits and plays the part of the liberal and the
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.120]  conservative, gives the Poles the false paradigm and the Poles stay within it.
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:33.960]  Yeah, I mean we look at the snitch culture, the double think, the relationships, the foreign
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:40.160]  countries painted as enemies, power hungry officials, the erosion of the language, the
[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:45.680]  overwhelming big brother nanny state, the personification of the party, perpetuation
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:53.320]  of war, the control of information, the social hierarchy, it's all, it's interesting, it's
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:58.600]  all predicted in George Orwell's book, and we're making tremendous progress, and like
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:04.760]  I said at the beginning of the show, you know, it's a microcosm and a macrocosm, you as
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:10.160]  an individual are bettering your life, and then together we will benefit society.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:17.640]  You're absolutely right, Mark Dice, let's talk to James in Texas, former military,
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:20.160]  about these mobile radiation trucks.
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:21.160]  Go ahead, James.
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:23.160]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:24.160]  Pretty good.
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:31.040]  I've got something I wanted to say, I want to thank you for waking me up and been watching
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:37.280]  your show for about six months here, and I want to address the concern to your audience.
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:42.560]  These people that have woken up and they know what's going on with the globalist agenda,
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:48.880]  I want you to be aware that if you woken up to the globalist, they have woken up to the
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.680]  fact that you are awake and you know what they're planning to do, and they will target
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:59.320]  you to try and keep you from voicing your opinion.
[02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:03.760]  That's right, and once you're in the fight, you're in it for life, but the big secret
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:09.120]  is we're already under attack, this is a global attack against every cop, every military,
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:14.760]  every housewife, every surgeon, we're all under this, this is a scientific, tiny elite
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:22.320]  doing this who are beyond evil, and folks must understand we are in a fight for our
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.440]  lives right now.
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.800]  Anything else that you want to comment on about the radiation scanners?
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:36.160]  It doesn't have to do with the scanners, it has to do with the DU, I have problems with
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:41.080]  my urination tract, and I'm having problems too.
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:47.680]  I'm paralyzed by a tetanus shot that I received in the army upon my discharge.
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:51.520]  Well we've got the Rockefeller Foundation says they did it, it's public, and people
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:15:56.080]  call in saying where is it, we've written like 15 articles or something on it with links
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:00.800]  to the Rockefeller Foundation, and people don't even, I mean are you mad that they did
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:01.800]  that to you?
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.560]  I mean it's like the government assaults us and it's kind of like well that's the government.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:11.440]  I am extremely angry, because I know if they would do that to me, someone who wanted to,
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.880]  you know I wanted to go and fight terrorists, when I found out there were none, I was kind
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:21.040]  of shocked, you know, and then when I found out they would do this to an American who
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:27.120]  would stand up for other Americans and willingly give his life for those people, and they would
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:28.680]  do that to me.
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:32.920]  You guys better believe that they will let you walk through a naked body scanner, and
[02:16:32.920 --> 02:16:34.600]  they don't care if it gives you cancer.
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:39.160]  No they wanted to, but here's the deal, they know you joined because you're good, and they
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:43.120]  know they're destroying what you think you're defending when you're actually helping build
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:48.520]  their empire, so when they're done with you, they're gonna hit you with soft kill vaccines
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.760]  and DU and the rest of it to debilitate you down the road, and when you get upset about
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:56.120]  it, they're gonna put you on a mentally ill list and come take your guns.
[02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:58.320]  When they're done, what do you do with an old battleship?
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:16:59.840]  You blow it up and sink it.
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:00.840]  What do you do with an old cannon?
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.760]  You spike it.
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:06.920]  They're trying to spike you, but let me tell you something brother, you're not spiked.
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:09.840]  They're not, your spirit, your soul's there.
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:14.360]  It's hard to get rid of DU, but Dr. Doug Rocky, former head of the Army's Radiology Program,
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:17.440]  you know, he could tell you what they did to him.
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.880]  And he watches them now, tell the troops, no problem with the DU, it is, let's get Doug
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:22.880]  Rocky back on.
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:26.760]  I mean, for anybody listening, cops, military, you better get it through your head.
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:29.800]  They want one group dead and hurt more than anybody else.
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:30.800]  That's you.
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:34.320]  When they're done with you like an old tire, they don't, you know, they want to burn you.
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:38.960]  I appreciate your call, James, very touching.
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.000]  Closing comments, Mark Dice, it's been great having you on, you know, a year ago you went
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.520]  out with the gold coins and tried to give them to people for almost nothing and they
[02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:49.840]  wouldn't take them, just showing what idiots they are.
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:53.400]  Yeah, you know, and then people said that they thought that the coin was fake, so they
[02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:56.920]  don't want to, yeah, I tried to, instead of trying to sell it to them for $50, I offered
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:59.960]  it to them for free if they had any idea how much it was worth.
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:06.080]  And one woman guessed that just a few cents, a 38 cents, I believe was her answer.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:07.840]  Maybe the highest one was a few hundred dollars.
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:11.880]  So yeah, just try to, you know, just be thankful that you're on the right path.
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:15.080]  People listen to this show, people that are aware, you know, you can become more aware
[02:18:15.080 --> 02:18:17.240]  once you find out the system.
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:24.880]  And if we don't, the consequences are horrific as the main bad guy in 1984 says, quote, never
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:28.640]  again will you be capable of ordinary human feeling.
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:30.920]  Everything will be dead inside of you.
[02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:35.240]  Never again will you be capable of love or friendship or joy of living or laughter or
[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:38.040]  curiosity or courage or integrity.
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:39.540]  You will be hollow.
[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:44.680]  We shall squeeze you empty and then we shall fill you with ourselves.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:51.160]  So I just say, as Orwell concluded his book, down with Big Brother.
[02:18:51.160 --> 02:18:55.160]  Well, that's spoken like a true terrorist.
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:19:01.480]  Yeah, and the interesting thing is once we can get our numbers up enough, we can become
[02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:02.480]  the norm.
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.600]  I mean, look what we've done for 9-Eleven Truth.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:08.700]  It went from being virtually unknown to being an internet conspiracy theory to spilling
[02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:14.160]  over into the mainstream with the few Hollywood people to now, and we have world leaders
[02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:21.040]  around the world in Germany and England and everywhere is just right on board with us.
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:26.640]  So if we can just get the word out about their big brother system, their nanny state, their
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:31.200]  social engineering plans, instead of us being looked at as the fringe, we're the norm and
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:32.200]  we can win.
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:33.280]  Well, yeah, I agree with you.
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:38.120]  But also just getting people to realize there is evil in the world and it's running the
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:39.120]  government.
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.040]  I mean, people have got to really get it to their head.
[02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:44.320]  They don't just care if the radiation hurts you or don't care.
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:45.840]  They want to hurt you.
[02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:52.080]  Yeah, they're inhuman, inhuman social Darwinist, and so, you know, hijack the culture jam,
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:56.240]  the social network site, you know, use it, use the system against the system to crack
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.240]  it open.
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:19:58.240]  Absolutely.
[02:19:58.240 --> 02:19:59.240]  Great job, Mark Dice.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:05.400]  If your handgun is loaded and easy to get to, it's also dangerous.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:10.040]  What if you could reach your loaded handgun instantly and still provide a margin of safety
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.560]  for your family?

[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:31.480]  Invisible Empire Chronicles, how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:21:31.480 --> 02:21:42.400]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:22:04.480]  Gold isn't for you, Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:06.760]  gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.360]  I get it, you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job that
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:15.840]  the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security
[02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.200]  would be there for you.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:21.800]  That's not what's happening, you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:25.880]  fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:26.880]  be secure.
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:30.360]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:34.680]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:40.600]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:43.960]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:44.960]  You should too.
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:48.520]  Find out what they know, call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very
[02:22:48.520 --> 02:22:59.760]  well, free 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.

[02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:34.640]  Folks, you need to get the same desperate spirit of resistance that I've got.
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:38.240]  You need to realize this is real, this is really happening.
[02:24:38.240 --> 02:24:43.360]  Mark Dice was talking about people coming up to him and saying, are you for real?
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.640]  Do you really mean this?
[02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:47.080]  Every time on an airplane, people ask me that.
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:51.520]  I have troops come up to me when I was with Jesse Ventura flying around the country and
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:54.000]  asking us both that we really meant what we were talking about.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.600]  Of course, I mean what I'm talking about, but it's 90 plus percent of what we cover,
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:05.960]  probably 95 or more, is open source, it's there, it's there.
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:13.760]  You think I'd get on the air 10 years ago when gold was $265 an ounce and say, I think
[02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:17.680]  you should buy gold and silver because they've passed the derivatives law and they're going
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:24.760]  to deflate the value of the dollar and historically, 100% of the time, metals go up.
[02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:29.240]  I mean, I sleep good at night, folks.
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:30.640]  I feel good about what I do.
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.200]  I believe what I'm saying, but I don't just believe it.
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:34.200]  I know it.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:39.640]  I've got the Pentagon and the National Security Council saying they're setting up a collectivist
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:43.320]  world government.
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:44.320]  It's real, okay?
[02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:49.800]  It's real, real, real, real, real, real, real.
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:52.160]  And I just want my children to have a future.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.360]  I want to beat these people.
[02:25:53.360 --> 02:25:57.000]  They're so horrible and they win because they're so ruthless.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.880]  The average person cannot believe they're this evil.
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:06.200]  Oh, heaven help me.
[02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:11.800]  I want to go back to your calls and the radiologist and my biggest frustration is I can't do it
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:12.800]  all.
[02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:17.080]  I can't warn everybody and I've got to spend my time on petty things like making sure
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:18.840]  the internet works or taking the trash out.
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:19.840]  I'm not complaining.
[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:22.200]  It's just I've got so much work I want to do.
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:24.080]  So many things, so many things.
[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:26.560]  We've got to stop these people.
[02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:31.160]  You've got to go to the next level in the fight against them and I appreciate everybody
[02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:35.560]  supporting our sponsors and our operation because we wouldn't be here without you, but
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:40.080]  I need you and everybody listening to, to become your own leaders in your own area and
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:42.040]  just wake up one person a week.
[02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:47.160]  That'll bring down the globalist, but that's poor caller who's been sterilized and in the
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:52.480]  military and the DU, you know, he said, yeah, if you, you know, if they didn't care about
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.360]  me, they don't care about you going through a body scanner and he's, he's wrong.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:26:58.880]  See the poor guy, he's a great guy.
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:01.440]  He can't even get it through his head.
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:02.920]  It's not that they don't care.
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:04.000]  They do care.
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.120]  They care about hurting you.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.120]  They love it.
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:17.220]  It's their whole stinking goal shifting gears into the economy, anti austerity protests
[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:21.360]  sweep across Europe as they raise taxes and cut pensions and just totally rob everybody
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:23.360]  to give all the money to the banks.
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.440]  Golds stayed up above $1,307 today.
[02:27:26.440 --> 02:27:31.000]  World grip by international currency war that's ongoing.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.800]  Bank of England deputy Charlie Dean says spend to save the economy means give them more money.
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:42.960]  Gold to go taps into gold fever with gold ATMs.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:44.880]  And I've got all these news about gold exploding.
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:49.040]  I wanted to briefly bring Ted Anderson up because he's the owner of this network.
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:52.480]  He's the guy that made so much of this possible and he's got gold and silver at the lowest
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:53.480]  prices.
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:55.360]  I've ever seen it anywhere in this market.
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:58.440]  And Ted, where's gold right now?
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:02.640]  Well, gold currently right now is trading at 1310 40.
[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:07.800]  It's seen a high today of 1313 20 silver one over $22 an ounce today.
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:10.200]  That's a high that it hasn't seen for over 30 years.
[02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:12.760]  It's been a big day for silver.
[02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:13.760]  Unbelievable.
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:18.440]  Ted, tell us the gold and silver you've got because again, you keep selling out of what
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:21.000]  you bought two months ago, a month ago, three weeks ago.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.680]  You've still got gold and silver in the market lower than it currently is.
[02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.760]  That's how you can have such good deals.
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:28.400]  What do you have in the silver half dollars?
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:29.400]  What do you got in gold?
[02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.880]  Well, I'm still holding that silver half dollar price.
[02:28:31.880 --> 02:28:38.200]  I don't know how long I can anymore now, but that $10 and 50 cents or 210 per roll of 20
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:40.000]  is not going to be seen.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:47.400]  I know that my market prices on the internet have gone over $12 and just, you know, the
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:50.360]  small amount of inventory that I have left, I don't think I'm going to be able to do it
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:51.360]  for much longer.
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:57.360]  283 on Frank's, I know those have already gone up to 288 355 22 on British sovereigns
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:59.800]  are more like 358.
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:03.880]  I mean, just the whole, the whole market is going upward and you know, it's just one
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:05.600]  of those things.
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.040]  The U.S. Eagles right now are at a great buy.
[02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:13.640]  You know, if you can pick up those under under 1300 under $1400 an ounce now, I mean, everything
[02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:20.440]  is just, you know, Alex, it's, it's just amazing to me how cyclical the gold prices
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:21.440]  are.
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.240]  I mean, we're heading into October and that's when we're going to see our highs.
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:27.360]  It's just amazing what we're at here.
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:29.320]  800 686 2237 800 686 2237.
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:35.360]  I want to come back into some more economic news briefly with you, Ted.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:38.000]  Then we're going to go to phone calls and a bunch of other news.
[02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:41.200]  But when I tell the listeners, my head is spinning.
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:45.160]  I mean, it's just all moving so fast right now.
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:48.120]  And I hope people protect themselves financially with gold and silver.
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:51.400]  These are great deals.
[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:55.440]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.440 --> 02:30:00.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:01.720]  Listen up friends.
[02:30:01.720 --> 02:30:03.640]  This is Alex Jones with key information.
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:07.600]  The mainstream media is now admitting that we're going into a depression.
[02:30:07.600 --> 02:30:10.360]  Don't be dependent on the government for you and your family.
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:15.760]  You need to get your own supply of high quality, storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.

[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:21.680]  food to choose from.

[02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:27.360]  you like some of the other guys.

[02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:36.200]  It comes with all the equipment you need to prepare it with open talk of a strike on Iran
[02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:37.440]  the next three months.
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:42.520]  The crisis in the Gulf and possible evacuations, get yourself and your family ready today.

[02:31:00.280 --> 02:31:04.600]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:09.600]  The tyranny is here, the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:12.240]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:16.760]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:18.000]  on earth.
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.800]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:24.640]  expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:28.680]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:30.760]  old powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:35.160]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:39.240]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:39.240 --> 02:31:44.320]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:45.320]  corner.
[02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:48.560]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:50.600]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.600]  It's here.

[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:04.600]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:08.920]  Not detergents but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:10.920]  owned and operated American company.
[02:32:10.920 --> 02:32:15.720]  My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:18.360]  these products for bath, air, laundry and dishes.
[02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:22.400]  There is nothing like these factory direct big money saving triple concentrated soaps
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:23.400]  anywhere.
[02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:30.440]  You can find free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com

[02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:35.920]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:42.720]  As founder and owner for over 63 years people keep asking me how's business?
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:46.840]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:32:46.840 --> 02:32:58.120]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying a 1 to 2 month soap
[02:32:58.120 --> 02:32:59.120]  sampler.
[02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:00.120]  Thank you.
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:08.680]  Big brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:10.840]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:12.840]  Well so does he.
[02:33:12.840 --> 02:33:26.480]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.480 --> 02:33:32.840]  This issue of them bathing TSA workers and then homeland security workers with these
[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:39.280]  super high power x-rays on the highways and our homes, that they would do it knowing it's
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:46.480]  dangerous, knowing it's going to hurt people, especially the idiots that are operating these.
[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:48.080]  It's just outside of federal law.
[02:33:48.080 --> 02:33:54.480]  There's federal law and international law and x-rays and people that work as radiologists
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:57.440]  throughout their lives have way higher cancers.
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:01.600]  That's not denied and this stuff is way off the charts compared to that.
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:08.520]  That's why we have this article, Feds Radiating Americans and Internal Checkpoints at PrismPlanet.com.
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:10.080]  This article has got to get out to everyone.
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:14.280]  Send it to your doctors, especially nurses, because Mark Dice is right.
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:19.240]  We need a movement like we have architects and engineers from 9-Eleven Truth, medical
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.440]  people, we're radiologists against body scanners.
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:27.120]  It's so incredible in the search term today, I hope people will keep entering this end
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.120]  to keep it up there.
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:31.200]  Hopefully it'll hit number one, I'm sure it will.
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:35.760]  Feds Radiating Americans, please put that into Google over and over again.
[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:37.080]  Feds Radiating Americans.
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:41.080]  So the top link will be our article, so hundreds of thousands of additional.
[02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:42.080]  We'll see it.
[02:34:42.080 --> 02:34:45.200]  This is the type of report that the Drudge Report tends to link to as well.
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:51.040]  They link to one of our stories yesterday about Obama can shut down private companies
[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:52.440]  under the new Cybersecurity Act.
[02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:57.480]  It's just a total dictatorship, briefly, because I want to go to Damon and some of
[02:34:57.480 --> 02:35:01.160]  the other callers that are dealing with this radiology stuff.
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:09.040]  Coming back to the economy, gold at $1,313 today, silver above $22, isn't that an all-time
[02:35:09.040 --> 02:35:10.600]  high for silver, Ted?
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:11.600]  It is.
[02:35:11.600 --> 02:35:14.160]  I mean, we hit that just a little bit a while ago.
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:16.720]  So silver has hit its all-time high?
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:21.480]  With the exception of 1980, silver hit $50 an ounce in 1980.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:26.040]  It's a high that's never been seen within the last 30 years.
[02:35:26.040 --> 02:35:28.720]  So we're still not at the peak with silver yet.
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:34.000]  When the Hunt Brothers were pushing silver up in 1980, they pushed it over $50 an ounce,
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.520]  and then it dropped down to about $3 an ounce.
[02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:41.080]  And I've got all these reports with all these top analysts and former Bush administration
[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:45.600]  top economists saying, we're in a depression, total implosion.
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:48.320]  You've got all the economic numbers coming out.
[02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:55.400]  Paper money and derivatives are not worth the paper they're printed on.
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:59.320]  Teds need to move into gold and silver, and I cannot think of a better place to start
[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:02.400]  than with those silver half-dollars at $10.50.
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:06.240]  I mean, they're $16 a lot of places, 12 everywhere else.
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:10.160]  That's a dollar and a half under any, I mean, you cannot find them at $10.50, folks.
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.160]  I challenge you.
[02:36:11.160 --> 02:36:13.440]  And Ted's got bags of them, but he's running out.
[02:36:13.440 --> 02:36:17.640]  And then you've got the Franks, you've got the Sovereigns, you ran out of the Buffaloes,
[02:36:17.640 --> 02:36:23.680]  you've got the Eagles at a great price, $800, 686, 2237, Ted.
[02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:24.680]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:28.680]  Well, just pay attention to what's going on in the economy and take a real serious look
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:32.960]  at your traditional investments, because I think they're going to be in trouble.
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:38.720]  Well, Ted, what does this mean for Bloomberg reporting a month ago that the majority of
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:44.400]  the futures in December are at $1,500?
[02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:46.960]  I mean, do you think it could really go that high?
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:51.560]  Well, yeah, actually, yeah, I think it could easily at $1,500 an ounce, and I don't think
[02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:54.800]  people will be too surprised when it gets there, considering the fact that we're already
[02:36:54.800 --> 02:36:57.240]  at $1,300 an ounce now.
[02:36:57.240 --> 02:37:02.560]  And to go another $200 is really just what happened the last few years.
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:06.920]  We've seen these $200 increases in the fall, almost four years in a row.
[02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:09.560]  So why wouldn't it happen this time?
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:15.120]  We're here, we're knocking on the door of $1,500, okay, maybe it might hit $1,490.
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:16.120]  But you know what?
[02:37:16.120 --> 02:37:17.680]  It's heading upward.
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:22.000]  It's September, October, November, December have always been better months than September
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  and the gold market.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.200]  Yeah, and I don't buy gold and silver as an investment.
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:29.040]  I buy it as a hedge against inflation and depression.
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:33.360]  But now more and more people, it is for investment because it's trading at four times what it
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:34.680]  was just a decade ago.
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:39.760]  Well, Alex, I mean, just simple as this, it's so much better than holding on to fiat currency.
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:42.680]  When you know that our government is sitting on a printing press and they can turn it on
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:47.360]  at any speed they want to, and at any time they turn it on, it's going to devalue what
[02:37:47.360 --> 02:37:48.360]  we have.
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:49.360]  What do you think is going to happen in the future?
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:53.480]  Well, that's one of the headlines today is that the world is in horror as the Federal
[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:56.280]  Reserve turns the printing presses on high.
[02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:00.440]  I mean, they are just flooding things, but it's not even getting to the public.
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:02.080]  They're flooding it to the banks.
[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:05.680]  Yeah, that's because there's not enough credit where the borrower is out there and the banks
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.320]  are just buying, you know, they're playing it safe, they're buying U.S. government securities.
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.360]  But you know, I mean, come on, you can't just keep doing good.
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.560]  So their so-called bailout and stimulus is just giving more money to the banks that
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:18.120]  engineered the implosion.
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:22.360]  It does, and it gives them great big fat profits that come directly out of taxation
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:24.800]  from us, though we the people of the United States.
[02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:28.200]  And that's why worldwide they're raising taxes everywhere and calling austerity.
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  Here's a headline.
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:31.600]  Gold price could hit 4,000, says Paulson.
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:36.240]  The gold price headed to over 1,313.
[02:38:36.240 --> 02:38:38.680]  On Monday it was $1,295.
[02:38:38.680 --> 02:38:45.680]  The price of gold, all-time high, finished higher, and it goes on to the speech of the
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:50.360]  University Club of New York City, Paulson, provided his broad outlook on several areas
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:53.640]  of financial markets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, the Federal Reserve, the price
[02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:54.640]  of gold.
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:58.960]  Paulson reiterated his bullish call on stocks, noting the historically large discrepancy
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:03.240]  between the equity earnings, and he went on to say that gold could hit 4,000.
[02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:09.000]  And that's John Paulson, the hedge fund magnate, who rose to fame after shorting securities
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:12.800]  tied to the housing market prior to the financial crisis of 2008.
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:13.800]  That's what he's doing.
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:16.680]  Yeah, you're right about that.
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:18.960]  And just take a look at the dollar index right now.
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:19.960]  It's slipping.
[02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:23.360]  There's so many foreign nations right now that are looking at the U.S. dollar as being
[02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:24.360]  doomed.
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:27.440]  I mean, it's just, it's sad, but that's the way that it is.
[02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:32.720]  We're losing our economic power status, and we're slipping into the second world nation
[02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:33.720]  thing.
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:37.960]  And it's just, it's sad that we've let it happen.
[02:39:37.960 --> 02:39:41.040]  We shouldn't be taking it down this road, but you know what, the United States is doing
[02:39:41.040 --> 02:39:45.440]  it, and the people in the United States have to buy insurance, and I mean, you know, no
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:49.760]  parachute is perfect, but the gold and silver really are the parachute, and it's better
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:53.880]  to jump out with a parachute if it's about to crash than with no parachute.
[02:39:53.880 --> 02:39:55.800]  And we just hope the shoot's been packed correctly.
[02:39:55.800 --> 02:40:01.880]  Here's Bloomberg, dollar trades near five months low before U.S. housing sentiment reports.
[02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:03.040]  I mean, there it is right there.
[02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:05.280]  The dollar is just tumbling right now.
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:10.400]  Yep, it is, and what would you rather have if you're sitting there with money in the
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:14.520]  savings account, would you rather have that money positioned in gold and silver, which
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:19.960]  has a 6,000 track record, 6,000 year track record of being money, or would you rather
[02:40:19.960 --> 02:40:25.160]  have this fiat currency that's only been separated from gold since 1971?
[02:40:25.160 --> 02:40:32.080]  I mean, seriously, in 1971, you could have purchased a home for about $24,000.
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:38.360]  You could have purchased a car for $1,500, a gallon of gasoline for $0.24.
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.840]  Where do you think the dollar's going to go from here?
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:47.520]  You just can't afford to stay into fiat money, and it's instruments like, you know, annuity,
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:53.400]  stocks, bonds, I mean, all the paper investments that you can think of, I mean, at least diversify
[02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:57.280]  your portfolio, maybe a minimum of 20% at this time.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:03.720]  I mean, the earthquake is happening, the storm is coming, I mean, batten down the hatches,
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:04.720]  get some gold and silver.
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:10.640]  Well, the storm's already here, but it's the leading edge, 800-686-2237, folks, I believe
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:13.560]  these are great deals, I know they're great deals, and I think this is a great place to
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:17.360]  start investing in gold and silver, or have you already bought them over the years?
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:20.840]  You know, when gold was 800 an ounce, it looked like a lot to pay for it, and now it looks
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:22.800]  like nothing at all.
[02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:26.480]  Imagine if it does hit $1,500, $2,000, $4,000 down the road.
[02:41:26.480 --> 02:41:32.400]  I mean, this is serious, 800-686-2237, tell them it's the radio special to get the lowest
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:34.240]  prices available anywhere I've seen.
[02:41:34.240 --> 02:41:35.240]  Ted, thank you.
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:36.240]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:37.240]  You bet.
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.800]  I want to go to Roger, ex-military, wants to comment on radiation DU, then we're going
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:46.320]  to finish up with Damon, who's a radiologist, a radiation therapist, but let's go back
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.000]  to, well, let's have Roger speak who's been holding.
[02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  Thanks for holding, Roger.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  What's on your mind?
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.520]  Yeah, you was talking about the radiation.
[02:41:55.520 --> 02:41:56.520]  Yes.
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:02.240]  Well, I'm ex-military, and I got to tell you, when you're in the military, you get to watch
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:06.720]  mainstream news, like when you're in the barracks and stuff like that, but that's really all
[02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:07.720]  you get.
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.840]  Most of the time, you're not even watching any TV, and being, if you're on active duty
[02:42:12.840 --> 02:42:14.240]  all the time, that's all you get.
[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:18.440]  Well, the only time, the only people that actually get, like, to really listen to your
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:24.240]  program and stuff like that, that are those of us that are in and out, in and out.
[02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:25.240]  Do you know what I'm saying?
[02:42:25.240 --> 02:42:26.240]  Yes.
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:27.240]  Okay.
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:37.080]  You know, it's just like before I was an E5, and because of the unit I was in, I had
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:42.200]  top-secret clearance on a couple of things, and one of the things that has happened is,
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:49.520]  you know, I've been, you know, I'm out now, and I got medical problems, and it's all
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:51.040]  because of the military.
[02:42:51.040 --> 02:42:55.800]  I got to catharize myself four to six times a day.
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:59.720]  You know, that doesn't happen all the time, but I have to do that probably within a month,
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:04.080]  maybe two, three times, where it would last, you know, like up to three days to get things
[02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:06.320]  working again.
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:10.400]  And it's just like you heard, and you even made a comment about how the military and
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.560]  Obama was saying that we would have to buy our own insurance, but then they backed off
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:15.560]  of that.
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:18.240]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:26.840]  Even though my stuff is combat-related, the only way, I'm at 80% disability, and the
[02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:33.560]  only way I can get 100% disability is if I would claim to be PTSD, and I'm not doing
[02:43:33.560 --> 02:43:34.560]  that.
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:36.840]  Yeah, they make you, you can have your legs blown off and not get taken care of, but if
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:40.560]  you'll say you're mentally ill, then they can take your second amendment away.
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.880]  Yeah, exactly, the right to carry arms, but they don't tell you that.
[02:43:44.880 --> 02:43:52.000]  Well, I said no, so I had to go and buy medical insurance to help cover my medical expenses,
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.560]  even though I go to the VA, which is ridiculous.
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:05.160]  I mean, my medicine bill every three months was like over $10,000, just for my pills.
[02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:06.160]  That's my pills.
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:09.200]  What do you think got you a DU, the vaccines?
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:10.200]  Both.
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:15.560]  And I'll tell you something else about the DU, the depleted uranium.
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:22.360]  Those ammo boxes, because I had to work to help the supply sergeant, because he was down,
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:24.320]  so I went in and helped.
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:30.200]  It's marked on the wood crates that the ammo boxes come in, but it's not marked on the
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:34.600]  ammo boxes, so the soldiers don't know what they're getting.
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:40.360]  And you know, we wear gloves, but the thing about it is, it's awkward loading your magazines
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:44.560]  and things like that with gloves, so you take your gloves off to load it so you don't know
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:45.560]  what you're actually getting.
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:53.720]  And worse than that, once a 50 cal round or an Abram Sabo goes into something, it aerosolizes.
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:56.840]  It turns into tiny particles, and that's when it's really deadly.
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:04.480]  Yep, and it becomes right after your chamber when you discharge the round.
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:10.040]  But here's the thing, when it comes to those scanners, we're told that you're not close
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:13.360]  enough, so you don't have to worry about it.
[02:45:13.360 --> 02:45:19.400]  So we're supposed to be on Alkspurts, like helping and things like that.
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:31.440]  And I will tell you this, you said, you were talking about, oh shoot, you talked to a guy
[02:45:31.440 --> 02:45:35.720]  I said to where they used to wear the badges, and I think years ago they had like little
[02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:40.240]  pens that you could carry in your pocket that would show how many rads you've taken
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:41.240]  in.
[02:45:41.240 --> 02:45:42.240]  You don't have any of that no more.
[02:45:42.240 --> 02:45:43.240]  Oh no, no.
[02:45:43.240 --> 02:45:49.520]  Listen, I've had the head of the DU program on probably 15 times or more, probably 20
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:50.520]  times.
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.520]  I want Doug Rocky back on.
[02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:54.280]  We've got to have him on at least a few times a year because he's pretty sick, and it's
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:57.720]  important to hear what he has to say while he's with us.
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:00.840]  But I mean, they knew it was deadly, totally deadly.
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:05.480]  He was just involved in the cleanup of it, and it killed most of his team in 1991 from
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:06.920]  the highway of death.
[02:46:06.920 --> 02:46:08.440]  Now it's official.
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:09.440]  They tell the troops.
[02:46:09.440 --> 02:46:12.920]  They don't even tell them they're being given DU, as you just said.
[02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:19.240]  And then they attack facilities and have them roll right into the facilities when they
[02:46:19.240 --> 02:46:24.000]  should be in full gear and even getting out of it, they can get enough to kill them.
[02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.000]  But again, it takes time.
[02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:26.520]  That's why the globalists love it.
[02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:31.080]  They love stuff that bioaccumulates and takes time to kill you because by then you're out
[02:46:31.080 --> 02:46:32.480]  of the military.
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:36.080]  And see, they don't want you, an old piece of military equipment.
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:38.360]  That's what you're called by the Pentagon.
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:39.840]  They don't want you out there.
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:41.720]  They want you debilitated.
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:44.120]  And or they want to say you're mentally ill.
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:45.120]  Go ahead.
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:52.520]  Well, and the other thing too is, is we are told that the Posse Comitatus Act doesn't
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:57.040]  pertain to us for a plain simple reason, and I looked it up.
[02:46:57.040 --> 02:47:01.120]  You know, I don't know, and I imagine for more who I talk to, different military people
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:04.720]  I talk to, they actually look it up just to see if that's true.
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:10.320]  Well, two things came up was, one was the Military Commissions Act of 2006 and the John
[02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:17.000]  Warner National Defense Authorization Act, 2007, yeah, where they say that the military
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:23.080]  that we can be used to help the police, you know, for like civil unrest or in case of
[02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:30.600]  national emergency and stuff, but what they did was, is they took that away from Congress
[02:47:30.600 --> 02:47:36.120]  and gave the president the authorization to, you know, dispatch the troops.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:42.640]  And he more or less said that whenever anything comes up, that the troops are to be dispatched.
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:44.280]  So as far as the cost.
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:47.400]  And that's why they're in regular shootings, that's why they're everywhere.
[02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:49.440]  No, it's dictatorship.
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:51.640]  You really know what you're talking about, Roger, good to hear from you.
[02:47:51.640 --> 02:47:52.640]  God bless you.
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:57.320]  Now, we cut him off earlier because I wanted Mark Dice to be able to finish up, but so
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:05.840]  sad to hear what's happening to Roger, but they, they, they do soft kill you so.
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:08.680]  But young military is not going to listen and cops aren't going to listen.
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:11.240]  They, a lot of them are on too big a power trip.
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:12.240]  Okay.
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.360]  So TSA workers, the ones that are smart and don't want to be radiated, they'll just fire
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:17.360]  you.
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:24.080]  They'll find plenty of idiots, not, not just idiots, people who are so trusting, so trusting.
[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:27.640]  Well, this false trust is going to get us all killed.
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:31.520]  You just remember that.
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:32.520]  Damon was calling in.
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:33.520]  He's a radiation therapist.
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:37.840]  He was talking about how many rads they're allowed to get every year on their lifetime
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:43.000]  as a radiologist, and then there's just no controls on these body scanners, these truck
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.760]  scanners, these house scanners, and it shows them on the news, cops driving around with
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:52.600]  no shielding with a giant radiation gun on the top, uh, finish up any comments you had
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:53.600]  on that.
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:54.600]  I appreciate you holding Damon.
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:55.600]  Yeah.
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:00.000]  Well, the most important thing I want to get out to the public is that the rule we're
[02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:09.960]  taught in school is that you have to, um, the goal is as low as reasonably achievable.
[02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:12.840]  It's allara is the acronym we use.
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:16.960]  And what they're always saying is the less radiation, the better, not the more the better.
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:22.160]  And you know, even when we're treating cancer patients, we try not to give any radiation
[02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:23.320]  to the rest of their body.
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:25.360]  We only want to give it to the tumor.
[02:49:25.360 --> 02:49:30.400]  So the fact that they're just, you know, shooting up, um, these truck drivers and their trucks
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:36.600]  and us in our houses and whatever else they're doing, I mean, the possibilities are endless.
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:40.960]  And I want to go back to the fact that, you know, if we could find out, the seabirds, there's
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:46.520]  an equation to determine it, and it's basically one joule per kilogram.
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:49.680]  And that's the, you know, the energy of the radiation they're using will determine the
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:57.200]  biological effect on the species, the substance, the biological, um, uh, well, we've got hundreds
[02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:00.000]  of mainstream articles where they admit that's what's even crazier.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:05.160]  They just admit, yeah, this is, uh, criminally, highly deadly and, uh, it's horrible, but
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:06.160]  we're just doing it.
[02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:09.360]  Well, here's the problem too, though, Alex, is that I've got family members.
[02:50:09.360 --> 02:50:14.200]  I got four brothers and I got folks and, and friends and I tell them, I'm like, you know,
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:18.280]  when, when, after Christmas with the painy bomber, the underwear bomber, whatever.
[02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.160]  I told people, I'm like, don't go through those body scanners, you know, and they're
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:24.200]  just like, well, you know, how am I supposed to get anywhere?
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:27.960]  I'm like, look, if you, one of my brothers works for a pharmaceutical company, he travels
[02:50:27.960 --> 02:50:31.880]  everywhere and I'm just like, you understand that you won't have to worry about whether
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:35.120]  you have a job and you know, four or five years, because if you get enough radiation
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:38.600]  exposed to you, you're going to have a lot more things to worry about than whether you
[02:50:38.600 --> 02:50:39.600]  get a job or not.
[02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:44.720]  I mean, why don't they see themselves as saying, no, no, I mean, they lied and said they weren't
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:48.080]  saving the images, Europe's pulling them out.
[02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:52.960]  And so our government's trying to make them keep it because it's not about stopping terrorist.
[02:50:52.960 --> 02:50:55.960]  It's about getting a biometric scan and giving you cancer.
[02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:56.960]  Stay there.
[02:50:56.960 --> 02:50:57.960]  I want to finish up with you.
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:58.960]  Damon on the other side.
[02:50:58.960 --> 02:51:15.040]  Thanks for watching, everybody!
