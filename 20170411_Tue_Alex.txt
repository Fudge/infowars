[00:00.000 --> 00:16.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's April 11th, 2017 on this Tuesday global edition.
[00:16.640 --> 00:19.720]  Trump has ordered the military to prepare plans to strike North Korea.
[00:19.720 --> 00:21.480]  That's mainstream news.
[00:21.480 --> 00:23.560]  South Korea is in a full panic.
[00:23.560 --> 00:27.480]  The Chinese are sending 150,000 troops to the North.
[00:27.480 --> 00:31.520]  North Korean ships are headed home from China as China starts sanctions against North Korea.
[00:31.520 --> 00:34.080]  So Trump did have an effect in that meeting.
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.560]  We have the CIA caught staging false flag attacks in the United States.
[00:37.560 --> 00:38.560]  That's mainstream news.
[00:38.560 --> 00:41.880]  Of course, you heard it here a month ago, but it's now breaking in the hill.
[00:41.880 --> 00:46.400]  And so much more, but first Paul Watson was right about Sweden.
[00:46.400 --> 00:51.240]  Remember when the media and all those lefty, lovey celebrities laughed at me for warning
[00:51.240 --> 00:53.400]  about mass immigration and Sweden?
[00:53.400 --> 00:54.400]  Yeah.
[00:54.400 --> 00:55.880]  Well, it's not so funny now, is it?
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.960]  Four people were killed and 15 injured when a rejected asylum seeker drove a truck into
[01:00.960 --> 01:02.880]  a crowd of people in Stockholm.
[01:02.880 --> 01:08.920]  The culprit, a 39 year old ISIS supporter, was ordered to be deported four months ago,
[01:08.920 --> 01:10.440]  yet remained in the country.
[01:10.440 --> 01:15.120]  If not for this hero who forced the terrorists to crash by driving into his path, hundreds
[01:15.120 --> 01:16.600]  more could have been killed.
[01:16.600 --> 01:21.880]  Acknowledging the total disaster that allowing in hundreds of thousands of refugees has been,
[01:21.880 --> 01:25.840]  Sweden's prime minister said, Sweden will never go back to the mass migration we had
[01:25.840 --> 01:27.640]  in autumn 2015.
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.640]  Never.
[01:28.640 --> 01:30.520]  Well, it's too frigging late now, isn't it?
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.280]  Everyone's virtually forgotten about this already because terrorism is the new normal
[01:35.280 --> 01:36.280]  in Europe.
[01:36.280 --> 01:40.880]  The terrorists have won, leftists think that going on with business as usual and allowing
[01:40.880 --> 01:44.600]  in untold millions more migrants is courageous.
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.960]  It's not courageous, it's cowardice.
[01:46.960 --> 01:52.800]  It's normalizing terrorism because they'd rather be dead than, God forbid, be called
[01:52.800 --> 01:53.800]  a racist.
[01:53.800 --> 01:58.920]  Strange, isn't it, how people aren't being mowed down by lorries in Japan, in Hungary,
[01:58.920 --> 01:59.920]  in the Czech Republic.
[01:59.920 --> 02:05.200]  Only in countries that have imported huge numbers of migrants that share certain beliefs.
[02:05.200 --> 02:09.480]  Some kind of connection there, can't quite put my finger on it, Sweden.
[02:09.480 --> 02:14.760]  The most progressive, pro-refugee, pro-Islam country in the entire West, a country that
[02:14.760 --> 02:20.200]  isn't involved in any Middle Eastern wars, and it's still got attacked by an Islamic
[02:20.200 --> 02:21.200]  terrorist.
[02:21.200 --> 02:24.200]  Progressives, your submission will not protect you.
[02:24.200 --> 02:27.320]  I was right about Sweden, Trump was right.
[02:27.320 --> 02:33.000]  Sweden, they took in large numbers, they're having problems like they never thought possible.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.520]  The migrant residents of Rinkeby pelted police officers with stones while they were trying
[02:38.520 --> 02:40.800]  to arrest one of the terror suspects.
[02:40.800 --> 02:44.440]  Oh, but no Gozones don't exist, they're a conspiracy theory.
[02:44.440 --> 02:48.400]  Is that why Post-Nord just announced that they were going to stop delivering mail in
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.200]  Holster, just down the road from Rinkeby, because it's quote, not safe?
[02:53.200 --> 02:54.200]  Rinkeby.
[02:54.200 --> 02:59.240]  The same suburb journalist, Tim Pool, was told by police to leave, or he'd be attacked.
[02:59.240 --> 03:04.440]  The same suburb where an Australian film crew was attacked, and notice how the media treats
[03:04.440 --> 03:09.560]  victims of Islamic terrorism compared to how they treat victims in other situations.
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.160]  How many times did they show you the picture of the dead boy on the Turkish beach?
[03:14.160 --> 03:18.080]  How about the child victims of the chemical weapons attack in Syria?
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.080]  Lots of times, right?
[03:19.080 --> 03:23.240]  Okay, how about the dismembered child victim of the Stockholm attack?
[03:23.240 --> 03:25.320]  No, they didn't show you that, did they?
[03:25.320 --> 03:29.000]  Did they show you the bodies of the 10 dead children after the NIS attack?
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.440]  No, did they show you the dead children after the attack on Christians in Egypt?
[03:33.440 --> 03:34.440]  No.
[03:34.440 --> 03:38.960]  Isn't it an amazing coincidence how we only see the bodies of dead kids when there's
[03:38.960 --> 03:40.640]  an agenda to be sold?
[03:40.640 --> 03:45.080]  CNN's really keen on giving a platform to a seven-year-old girl who's being used as
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.000]  a mouthpiece to sell the invasion of Syria.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.640]  Banna, do you blame President Assad for this?
[03:51.640 --> 03:54.240]  Yes.
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.760]  What is your message to President Assad?
[03:58.760 --> 04:00.560]  I am very sad.
[04:00.560 --> 04:03.280]  Jake Tapper wants you to follow her on Twitter.
[04:03.280 --> 04:07.920]  Are they going to give a voice to the children of parents massacred by Islamic terrorists
[04:07.920 --> 04:09.360]  on the streets of Europe?
[04:09.360 --> 04:10.920]  Yeah, don't hold your breath.
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.240]  Sweden's new feminist leader wants to ban deportations altogether, even of rapists.
[04:17.240 --> 04:19.240]  Because Sweden is a racist society.
[04:19.240 --> 04:25.240]  Yeah, so racist that she, a black woman from Uganda, was just elected to lead a major political
[04:25.240 --> 04:26.240]  party.
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.200]  But don't worry, because left-wing newspaper Afton Bladder has a solution.
[04:31.200 --> 04:34.280]  Stop importing hundreds of thousands of Muslim migrants?
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.400]  No.
[04:35.400 --> 04:40.240]  Men cause from big cities, and the mayor of Stockholm says Sweden will defeat terrorists
[04:40.240 --> 04:43.400]  by thinking of kindness and openness.
[04:43.400 --> 04:51.400]  Oh, you mean like the openness that allowed 150 ISIS terrorists to cross back into Sweden?
[04:51.400 --> 04:57.800]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[04:57.800 --> 05:01.600]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, for an incredibly important broadcast.
[05:01.600 --> 05:07.360]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs, and today Vladimir Putin says U.S. preparing to bomb Syrian
[05:07.360 --> 05:12.920]  capital and will blame devastation on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[05:12.920 --> 05:16.200]  Sounds like someone's been watching MSNBC.
[05:16.200 --> 05:20.400]  Seriously, guys, we should be Putin our differences Assad.
[05:20.400 --> 05:25.320]  Either way, Vladimir Putin has sensationally claimed that the U.S. preparing airstrikes
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.840]  on the Syrian capital and will pin the blame on Bashar al-Assad's forces.
[05:29.840 --> 05:32.400]  You hear that?
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.400]  That's right.
[05:33.400 --> 05:34.400]  Those are owls and crickets.
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.160]  Because the left doesn't have any more Russia, Russia, Russia.
[05:38.160 --> 05:42.600]  The story that's been dead for a long time, but really died last week when Tomahawk missiles
[05:42.600 --> 05:44.080]  hit Syria.
[05:44.080 --> 05:48.160]  The Russian leader made the astonishment claim that the U.S. is planning to fake chemical
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.440]  weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian President Sergio Mattarella.
[05:53.440 --> 05:57.520]  Well, you can find more reports like this at infowars.com.
[05:57.520 --> 06:02.440]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[06:02.440 --> 06:03.800]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:03.800 --> 06:08.160]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid
[06:08.160 --> 06:09.160]  products of 2017.
[06:09.160 --> 06:12.280]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[06:12.280 --> 06:15.920]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from
[06:15.920 --> 06:18.200]  Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[06:18.200 --> 06:22.360]  The PPX is so small, you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful, you can run some
[06:22.360 --> 06:27.240]  110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.

[08:24.200 --> 08:30.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[08:30.480 --> 08:37.120]  A passenger getting beaten up for not getting off the plane on United Airlines is the top
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.160]  story right now in the United States and their stocks are down.
[08:41.160 --> 08:42.160]  You know what?
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.160]  I'm not going to cover it.
[08:43.160 --> 08:45.120]  It's their private property.
[08:45.120 --> 08:46.960]  He didn't get off the plane.
[08:46.960 --> 08:49.480]  I think it was handled wrong.
[08:49.480 --> 08:51.160]  He wouldn't get off the cop taser thing.
[08:51.160 --> 08:52.360]  That was excessive probably.
[08:52.360 --> 08:57.920]  But it's not as important, ladies and gentlemen, as Trump orders military to prepare plans
[08:57.920 --> 08:59.640]  to hit North Korea.
[08:59.640 --> 09:02.000]  That's mainstream news.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.840]  Government tries to calm South Korean's fear of imminent war.
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.400]  Reuters, North Korea ships head home after China orders coal returned.
[09:11.400 --> 09:14.400]  That's showing that they're punishing North Korea as Trump demanded.
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.680]  That is a very good sign that the Chinese and North are about to back down.
[09:18.680 --> 09:20.040]  Thank God.
[09:20.040 --> 09:24.720]  North Korea paper reports China has deployed 150,000 troops to North Korea border.
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.320]  Still, tensions are very high, folks.
[09:26.320 --> 09:30.400]  This is one of the most dangerous times in world history.
[09:30.400 --> 09:34.560]  Unusual Navy patrol sparks fear of foreign sub-Othcalia coast.
[09:34.560 --> 09:38.240]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com, a hit Daniel's story.
[09:38.240 --> 09:40.840]  So that's just some of the news on that front.
[09:40.840 --> 09:45.320]  Then something ultra-huge.
[09:45.320 --> 09:52.160]  North Korea has come out and threatened back and saying, we will nuke your aircraft carriers.
[09:52.160 --> 09:55.520]  And Trump saying back, we'll nuke you as well.
[09:55.520 --> 09:58.640]  So this is really deteriorating quickly.
[09:58.640 --> 10:01.320]  The stories are up on infowars.com.
[10:01.320 --> 10:06.040]  They're also on drudgereport.com and prismplanet.com.
[10:06.040 --> 10:11.240]  North Korea state media warns of nuclear strike have provoked as U.S. warships approach.
[10:11.240 --> 10:17.520]  Again, that is Reuters on Yahoo News.
[10:17.520 --> 10:23.600]  Expert in infowars.com, U.S. could be planning strike on North Korea nuclear reactor, worst
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.280]  case scenario, nuclear war.
[10:27.280 --> 10:34.440]  That is today, April 11th by Paul Joseph Watson.
[10:34.440 --> 10:40.120]  And it's normal, it's some crazy government god who's a total little weakling with a bunch
[10:40.120 --> 10:42.520]  of slaves under him.
[10:42.520 --> 10:46.480]  And as usual, our government under Clinton gave him the reactors, gave him the materials,
[10:46.480 --> 10:47.480]  gave him everything.
[10:47.480 --> 10:50.280]  ABB was allowed to do it.
[10:50.280 --> 10:56.280]  U.S. could be planning strike on North Korean nuclear reactor, worst case scenario, nuclear
[10:56.280 --> 10:59.880]  war.
[10:59.880 --> 11:01.080]  That's all coming up today.
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.280]  And I'm going to go over the clips in details.
[11:06.280 --> 11:09.400]  That ties into a new story from Steve Watson.
[11:09.400 --> 11:11.440]  Now you think this is beyond mainstream news.
[11:11.440 --> 11:13.160]  I haven't seen it.
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.960]  Vladimir Putin on national Russian TV said Syrian chemical attack was a false flag, a
[11:18.960 --> 11:21.560]  stage event, and that more are coming.
[11:21.560 --> 11:29.120]  They plan to plant chemicals in Damascus and accuse the Syrian government of an attack.
[11:29.120 --> 11:33.320]  Pentagon cast doubt on AP report claiming Russia knew about Syrian chemical attack.
[11:33.320 --> 11:35.920]  That's good news, the Pentagon didn't push in war with Russia just yet.
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.120]  Tillerson, Russia must choose between Assad and the U.S. Well, why did our government
[11:40.120 --> 11:43.560]  start trying to topple Assad?
[11:43.560 --> 11:49.320]  And then every time Russia goes along with an attack on Iraq or an attack on Libya, the
[11:49.320 --> 11:52.920]  U.S. only starts more wars with Russia and then overthrows Ukraine.
[11:52.920 --> 11:59.600]  So Russia gets the fact that they've already tried appeasing for the last 15 years and it's
[11:59.600 --> 12:01.960]  not working.
[12:01.960 --> 12:08.160]  Now, let's get into the real meat potatoes because I'm going to go back into this in
[12:08.160 --> 12:12.160]  just a moment and the false flag situation and the proof.
[12:12.160 --> 12:15.360]  But first off, look at this.
[12:15.360 --> 12:27.040]  The Hill is reporting on something we told you the day Vault 7 came out months ago.
[12:27.040 --> 12:30.520]  But now it's in mainstream news, the very same Hill newspaper that criticizes yours
[12:30.520 --> 12:32.920]  truly constantly.
[12:32.920 --> 12:35.960]  Security firm links CIA to a series of past attacks.
[12:35.960 --> 12:41.160]  You read the article, it's what's already in the leaks, the two different Vault 7 dumps.
[12:41.160 --> 12:47.320]  The CIA has a bunch of tools and they engage in operations to frame Russia hacking into
[12:47.320 --> 12:54.480]  computers and launching attacks on Congress, on the CIA, on the NSA, on the cyber command.
[12:54.480 --> 12:59.080]  So they can go back to Congress and get more money so that when the generals retire they
[12:59.080 --> 13:04.240]  can get $10 million a year paychecks from the big telecoms that are putting in the hundreds
[13:04.240 --> 13:11.560]  of billions of dollars per every few years of equipment to spy on the American people.
[13:11.560 --> 13:18.560]  So here it is, April 11th being reported by the Hill.
[13:18.560 --> 13:24.160]  Here it is being reported back in March 31st by the Daily Mail.
[13:24.160 --> 13:29.320]  These WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA use computer code to hide the origins of its
[13:29.320 --> 13:32.200]  hacking attacks and disguise them as Russian or Chinese.
[13:32.200 --> 13:36.480]  I wonder where they got that in here.
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.040]  Oh, was it zero hedge?
[13:40.040 --> 13:47.000]  WikiLeaks reveals marble, proof CIA disguised their hack attacks, Russia, Chinese or Arabic?
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  No.
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.840]  Is it the March 31st RT?
[13:51.840 --> 13:53.160]  No.
[13:53.160 --> 14:01.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's March 7th, infowars.com, and we get articles before this, Vault 7 CIA
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.720]  can stage fake Russian hacking to undermine Trump, CIA kept Russian cyber attack techniques
[14:06.720 --> 14:09.200]  handy for false flags.
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.080]  Infowars.com, they did a 30-second search and found that one.
[14:13.080 --> 14:18.720]  I know we reported it before March 7th, but there's infowars.com first, yet again, why
[14:18.720 --> 14:24.560]  we're first among being attacked, why we're first being demonized, why Google, Facebook,
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.280]  Twitter, all of them admit they're strangling us, shutting off our advertising, not letting
[14:28.280 --> 14:36.160]  us advertise on Google, blocking us, our revenues down 75% on Google ads, on YouTube, even though
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.440]  our traffic's way up.
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.240]  WikiLeaks comes out, we read it, we tell you, we break it down first.
[14:44.240 --> 14:49.000]  Another March 7th article, WikiLeaks, Vault 7 release confirms infowars, decades of research.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.640]  Then we have articles going back over 15 years, giving you the specifics.
[14:52.640 --> 14:58.480]  Oh, by the way, Wired came out today and said that your thumbprint is not a good passcode
[14:58.480 --> 15:03.160]  for your iPhone, and that it can easily be hacked, and that it is even worse than a signature
[15:03.160 --> 15:07.680]  or a personal ID code, told you that 20-plus years ago.
[15:07.680 --> 15:11.800]  Not bragging, you should understand, we're under attack as fake news because we're the
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.480]  opposite.
[15:15.480 --> 15:18.840]  We told you Trump was going to win, we told you there was fake polls, we told you the
[15:18.840 --> 15:22.640]  WMDs were fake.
[15:22.640 --> 15:25.640]  All the New York Times is telling you that fingerprints aren't safe to get into your
[15:25.640 --> 15:28.720]  phones, and they're very easy to hack, and that if there's a digital signature that they
[15:28.720 --> 15:36.520]  can steal, and they told you last year, cover up your camera on your computer because it
[15:36.520 --> 15:39.480]  can watch and listen to you and that they are doing it.
[15:39.480 --> 15:45.680]  Oh, I told you that in Libya now that Al Qaeda took over, they're selling people as sex slaves.
[15:45.680 --> 15:49.360]  Oh my gosh, it's an international business times today.
[15:49.360 --> 15:54.040]  Oh my gosh, April up, let's give them a Pulitzer Prize.
[15:54.040 --> 15:57.080]  Migrants are being sold at open slave markets in Libya.
[15:57.080 --> 16:04.080]  But a month ago, Stephen Colbert played clips of me and so did others where they said, oh,
[16:04.080 --> 16:09.160]  they sell women on top of slave blocks, and they made jokes about what's a slave block?
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.120]  Well they put you up on a pedestal, somebody gets a look at you, and they have the women
[16:13.120 --> 16:18.600]  take their clothes off so they can see it, then they sell you.
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.360]  But all these different shows attack and make jokes that I claim Muslims are selling sex
[16:23.360 --> 16:24.360]  slaves.
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.240]  Oh, but I'm right again.
[16:28.240 --> 16:33.720]  Everything I'm saying is easily verifiable, but this is what we're facing.
[16:33.720 --> 16:38.040]  And so if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[16:38.040 --> 16:41.560]  They say Info Wars is under criminal investigation by the FBI.
[16:41.560 --> 16:45.640]  They have Congressional Armed Services Committee hearings with no proof and say that we get
[16:45.640 --> 16:48.240]  our directives from the Russians.
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.920]  And so we need to be shut down and that they've set up a Ministry of Truth that Obama signed
[16:52.920 --> 16:59.560]  in the law, December 6th of last year, a month before he left office, month and a half.
[16:59.560 --> 17:06.480]  And it says the State Department and CIA will shut down independent media in America that
[17:06.480 --> 17:09.760]  is blocking their operations.
[17:09.760 --> 17:12.560]  And now they're going to call me a Russian agent again because Vladimir Putin has come
[17:12.560 --> 17:16.200]  out and said clearly the chemical attack was a false flag.
[17:16.200 --> 17:17.200]  We never do that.
[17:17.200 --> 17:19.920]  Just like they did a few years ago, they got caught.
[17:19.920 --> 17:23.000]  And then we have Ron Paul saying it and we have the British Ambassador saying it.
[17:23.000 --> 17:24.200]  Are we all Russian agents?
[17:24.200 --> 17:26.720]  I guess Putin is.
[17:26.720 --> 17:30.040]  So let's go ahead and play Vladimir Putin.
[17:30.040 --> 17:32.280]  Is Darya going to read the subtitles or am I?
[17:32.280 --> 17:34.280]  Oh, Darya, you're there.
[17:34.280 --> 17:39.080]  Okay, we've got an evil Russian working here, US Army veteran the whole nine yards, but
[17:39.080 --> 17:40.080]  she can't be trusted.
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.840]  But here, she's going to read what Putin had to say.
[17:41.840 --> 17:42.920]  Here it is.
[17:42.920 --> 17:49.280]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.800]  anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including
[17:53.800 --> 17:59.840]  the southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again prepared to release some similar chemical
[17:59.840 --> 18:04.280]  substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them.
[18:04.280 --> 18:10.680]  But we regard that any such incident would be reason enough for a thorough investigation.
[18:10.680 --> 18:15.880]  We are preparing to make a formal call to the relevant UN agency in The Hague and call
[18:15.880 --> 18:21.160]  on the international community to investigate thoroughly these incidents.
[18:21.160 --> 18:27.000]  And depending on the results of the investigation to make informed decisions and take meaningful
[18:27.000 --> 18:28.000]  action.
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.880]  Alright, let's go to the former British ambassador to Syria, Peter Ford, two days ago, saying
[18:34.880 --> 18:39.720]  that they've now given them plenty of excuses to stage more false flags.
[18:39.720 --> 18:47.040]  And based on previous experience, including Iraq, we can see that we cannot take at face
[18:47.040 --> 18:53.440]  value what the so-called intelligence experts tell us, not when they have an agenda.
[18:53.440 --> 18:59.080]  But come back to the main point, it's not going to end here, and we are likely written
[18:59.080 --> 19:07.200]  to be dragged into it, because Trump has just given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage
[19:07.200 --> 19:09.960]  fake flag operations.
[19:09.960 --> 19:18.960]  Seeing how successful and how easy it is with a gullible media to provoke the West into
[19:18.960 --> 19:24.960]  intemperate reactions, they will very likely stage an operation similar to what they did
[19:24.960 --> 19:29.680]  and this was documented by the United Nations in August last year.
[19:29.680 --> 19:36.200]  They mounted a chlorine gas attack on civilians and they tried to make it look like it was
[19:36.200 --> 19:37.800]  a regime operation.
[19:37.800 --> 19:44.920]  This marked my words, you're hearing it here, and it will happen, and we'll get all the
[19:44.920 --> 19:50.480]  warmongers coming to tell us that Assad is defying us and we must go in more heavily
[19:50.480 --> 19:51.480]  into Syria.
[19:51.480 --> 19:54.160]  This will be fake flag.
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.160]  Fake flag, a new term is coined, better than false flags, the public can actually understand
[19:58.160 --> 19:59.160]  what that means.
[19:59.160 --> 20:03.280]  Meanwhile, I have the report I'm going to play in a few minutes, CNN attacked myself and
[20:03.280 --> 20:09.800]  others for saying that this was a false flag and they always say that we have no proof.
[20:09.800 --> 20:14.040]  They don't actually show us with the proof, I don't play Ron Paul first, but it just
[20:14.040 --> 20:19.960]  illustrates the fact that the rebels have been caught red-handed once and at least three
[20:19.960 --> 20:26.080]  other times partially launching attacks on themselves once it blew up on them as they
[20:26.080 --> 20:32.640]  were preparing to launch it inside a city area and they've done this before so Putin
[20:32.640 --> 20:37.440]  rightfully is saying they'll probably detonate it in Aleppo or somewhere like Damascus in
[20:37.440 --> 20:40.920]  a suburb and then say it's ours.
[20:40.920 --> 20:46.640]  And this is Obama and now Trump's red line and the Syrians are winning the war, why in
[20:46.640 --> 20:48.480]  the world would they launch it?
[20:48.480 --> 20:53.520]  Well, they say they have the track of the planes flying from that base over this village.
[20:53.520 --> 20:59.520]  The Russians say they bombed Al Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nusra and that it was chemicals on the
[20:59.520 --> 21:00.720]  ground that killed them.
[21:00.720 --> 21:03.640]  The media is also saying that we say no chemical attack happened.
[21:03.640 --> 21:09.200]  No, I believe 80-something people died from a chemical attack, but I want to ask again
[21:09.200 --> 21:11.360]  why were we all shown the images of dead kids?
[21:11.360 --> 21:15.080]  When we never see the images of dead kids, when it's shahadis running over people in
[21:15.080 --> 21:24.080]  London or in Luxembourg or in Stockholm, Sweden or in Brussels, Belgium or in Paris, France
[21:24.080 --> 21:29.200]  or in Nice or in Berlin or in Cologne.
[21:29.200 --> 21:33.720]  You never see that, but you saw it here, didn't you?
[21:33.720 --> 21:38.800]  And when our missiles goes astray and hit a village and killed four people, do we see
[21:38.800 --> 21:43.520]  images of those dead kids?
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.400]  This is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:47.400 --> 21:52.200]  So Ron Paul came out first, we came out first, we had an article day one with our sources
[21:52.200 --> 21:58.080]  in Syria with the jihadis celebrating, let's show Syrian girls article, if we can, that
[21:58.080 --> 22:02.080]  it was a false flag, we had the first article and then we showed the jihadis celebrating
[22:02.080 --> 22:07.080]  that they'd done it because see, they get paid by Saudi Arabia for this.
[22:07.080 --> 22:11.360]  So they want to show they did it and just hope our media covers it up for them.
[22:11.360 --> 22:15.320]  Report Soros link group behind chemical attack in Syria, it is a group he funds.
[22:15.320 --> 22:17.400]  Chemical attack has all the hallmarks of a false flag.
[22:17.400 --> 22:19.720]  The media makes jokes about that.
[22:19.720 --> 22:25.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, George Soros admittedly funded the Arab Spring, he admittedly funded
[22:25.280 --> 22:31.160]  the overthrow of Ukraine and their elected government.
[22:31.160 --> 22:35.080]  He's hardcore, he's crashed major government's currencies.
[22:35.080 --> 22:39.560]  He's a James Bond villain in the real world.
[22:39.560 --> 22:44.400]  But the media makes jokes, all the little sweet Soros, he says he would be behind it.
[22:44.400 --> 22:49.080]  George Soros at age 15 was rounding up Jews by the thousands.
[22:49.080 --> 22:51.560]  He's a famous Nazi collaborator.
[22:51.560 --> 22:54.960]  If you're rounding up people, your own people by the thousands and marching them off to
[22:54.960 --> 23:00.080]  death after your album when you're 15, what do you do when you're 87 or whatever it is?
[23:00.080 --> 23:09.240]  But the media again makes jokes, oh, Alex Jones says it could be a false flag.
[23:09.240 --> 23:16.200]  I mean Soros was demanding February 2nd that Trump overthrow Assad.
[23:16.200 --> 23:19.520]  The good news is Trump's coming out as I told you yesterday and saying I don't want to know
[23:19.520 --> 23:23.320]  Flowzone, I don't want to widen this, I don't want to topple Assad, it's his surrogates
[23:23.320 --> 23:25.360]  that are doing it and they've proven they're out of control.
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.160]  I don't believe it's a double message like we've been hearing from Pachennik.
[23:29.160 --> 23:31.200]  I think Pachennik's right on most things.
[23:31.200 --> 23:35.760]  But Trump's told confidants and others that no, he doesn't want this as he always said,
[23:35.760 --> 23:40.880]  but he wants to say nobody better use chemicals because we don't know who did it either way.
[23:40.880 --> 23:45.400]  And that's now what the Secretary of Defense has come out and said.
[23:45.400 --> 23:47.240]  And so has the Secretary of State.
[23:47.240 --> 23:50.600]  We're doing this to deter chemicals, they were supposed to give up the chemicals and
[23:50.600 --> 23:52.240]  the chemicals were at that base.
[23:52.240 --> 23:53.240]  Now is that true?
[23:53.240 --> 23:57.440]  We don't know 100%.
[23:57.440 --> 24:01.120]  But I know from inside the White House what Trump believes.
[24:01.120 --> 24:06.000]  I told you first that he believes he's sending a message on chemical weapons and now that's
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.000]  what they've said.
[24:07.000 --> 24:10.760]  They've come out again last night today and said do not use chemicals anybody.
[24:10.760 --> 24:15.840]  Well, how do you deter then the rebels from staging false flags, fake flags as the British
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.840]  Ambassador called it.
[24:16.840 --> 24:21.120]  But notice MSM won't show you Putin, the British Ambassador, Iran Paul.
[24:21.120 --> 24:23.480]  I guess Bill O'Reilly did a few nights ago and made fun of Iran Paul.
[24:23.480 --> 24:24.480]  That's it.
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.120]  But no one else is showing serious statesmen that are respected.
[24:29.120 --> 24:30.120]  Say what you want about Putin.
[24:30.120 --> 24:38.120]  He's respected when the President of Russia says that they think it was staged and they
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.800]  think more is coming.
[24:39.800 --> 24:41.600]  That should be on our news.
[24:41.600 --> 24:45.400]  Let's go ahead and play Ron Paul from his own show last week and we've got Ron Paul again
[24:45.400 --> 24:46.400]  on RT.
[24:46.400 --> 24:51.040]  In fact, I want to play both clips, but here's Ron Paul on his own program.
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.640]  And who would benefit?
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.480]  It makes no sense that even if you were totally separate from this and take no sides of this
[24:58.480 --> 25:03.120]  and you were just an analyst, it doesn't make any sense for Assad in these conditions to
[25:03.120 --> 25:06.600]  all of a sudden use poison gases.
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.920]  I think it's a zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[25:11.920 --> 25:16.520]  We've got one more clip of him on RT that's a lot longer, but we'll just play part of
[25:16.520 --> 25:18.680]  it right now where he basically says the same thing.
[25:18.680 --> 25:20.560]  So this is not kooky.
[25:20.560 --> 25:23.840]  This is what most people geopolitically believe and know because you have a group that's been
[25:23.840 --> 25:25.240]  caught doing it before.
[25:25.240 --> 25:28.240]  They have the motive to do it again because it will bring the United States in to kick
[25:28.240 --> 25:29.840]  out their enemy Assad.
[25:29.840 --> 25:36.560]  You have al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Nezra all celebrating day one since last Thursday of the strikes
[25:36.560 --> 25:41.280]  and giving them hope now and they've had more attacks on U.S. camps inside Syria in the
[25:41.280 --> 25:47.880]  last few days as they get oxygen in their lungs in this civil war that we've now been
[25:47.880 --> 25:52.680]  injected into and I support it because I wanted to end it by kicking al-Qaeda and al-Nezra
[25:52.680 --> 25:56.760]  and these groups out, but that's not happening now it looks like.
[25:56.760 --> 25:58.720]  So things are spiraling out of control.
[25:58.720 --> 26:02.600]  I'm going to cover China in the next segment, which is really the big enchilada, but right
[26:02.600 --> 26:05.560]  now let's get back to Ron Paul's clip.
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.280]  They needed a so-called excuse.
[26:08.280 --> 26:09.720]  They worked real hard.
[26:09.720 --> 26:15.320]  That is our government and their coalition, an excuse to go into Iraq so they can talk
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.280]  to stories, all kinds of things and that's what this is part of.
[26:19.280 --> 26:24.840]  I don't know why, if any of it is true, why they couldn't wait and take a look at it.
[26:24.840 --> 26:31.840]  A few years ago in 2013 there were these similar stories that didn't go anywhere because with
[26:31.840 --> 26:36.600]  a little bit of a pause there was a resistance to it built up in our Congress as well as
[26:36.600 --> 26:37.600]  the American people.
[26:37.600 --> 26:43.360]  They thought it was all a fraud and that nothing like that was happening and right now I just
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.360]  don't see how it could conceivably, but what they claim because it's helping ISIS, it's
[26:48.360 --> 26:53.560]  helping al-Qaeda, it's helping the enemy that we're supposed to please be fighting.
[26:53.560 --> 26:58.320]  That's right, bingo, total bingo, everything there's total veritas who can deny it.
[26:58.320 --> 27:01.640]  Now I'm going to play this and really try to not start it and stop it because I want
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.040]  to come back and get into the North Korea situation with China that's probably 10 times
[27:05.040 --> 27:08.400]  bigger than this, but this is all illustrative of how our media deceives.
[27:08.400 --> 27:14.760]  For CNN, trying to drive a wedge in Trump's main popular support base, trying to give
[27:14.760 --> 27:18.680]  us attention hoping we do it more, I could care less about being on CNN, trying to get
[27:18.680 --> 27:25.840]  us all to throw the baby out with the bathwater and be mad at Trump, went overall he's doing
[27:25.840 --> 27:29.480]  a great job domestically and I understand why he did this to look strong and he couldn't
[27:29.480 --> 27:36.680]  tell either way and they also wanted to send a message to North Korea and it seems like
[27:36.680 --> 27:39.800]  it's happened.
[27:39.800 --> 27:42.880]  And so we're going to start the clip now and then we're going to come back with the rest
[27:42.880 --> 27:45.080]  of it on the other side.
[27:45.080 --> 27:49.040]  You know what, I'll go to the clip when we come back on the other side just so we have
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.520]  plenty of time to get to it and then I'll get into all the other big issues that we're
[27:53.520 --> 27:59.720]  facing but alt-right turns on President Trump will detail exactly what's happening there
[27:59.720 --> 28:00.840]  when we come back.
[28:00.840 --> 28:08.200]  First off, I talked earlier about how Google, media matters, the Democrats, Facebook, Twitter,
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.760]  YouTube, they're all bragging, hey, we've demonetized InfoWars 75%, Paul's got all
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.720]  the graphs, he's broken that down last week, they're bragging how they kicked us off Google
[28:17.720 --> 28:24.520]  ads via AdRoll, they brag how they're age-restricting us and just mild videos that we covered that
[28:24.520 --> 28:30.040]  would never be age-restricted on CNN, they are strangling us in 100 different ways basically
[28:30.040 --> 28:35.720]  and admitting it, understand, they've sold this to the left that, oh, it's cute and fun
[28:35.720 --> 28:41.600]  if we shut up the nationalists, the patriots, what they call the alt-right, that's a form
[28:41.600 --> 28:47.200]  of dehumanization, I'm not the alt-right, I'm a libertarian who really wants prosperity
[28:47.200 --> 28:53.480]  and freedom for everybody, I fight real racism, I fight real classism, I want prosperity,
[28:53.480 --> 28:57.240]  that's why I'm against this war expanding and all the rest of it and that's why I'm
[28:57.240 --> 29:01.320]  critical of Trump, when Democrats wouldn't be critical of Hillary doing this, you can
[29:01.320 --> 29:06.080]  bet your bottom dollar, I have integrity, I have credibility, I don't get my funding
[29:06.080 --> 29:10.040]  from political parties or big corporations, I get it from listeners that support us and
[29:10.040 --> 29:15.360]  by the products at InfoWarsStore.com but we're able to finish funding ourselves without advertising
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.080]  what they're trying to kill, now the good lords open a lot of other windows to us to support
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.080]  us so I'm very thankful but if you're not spreading InfoWars.com articles, if you're
[29:24.080 --> 29:28.320]  not telling people, hey, this is the forbidden site, this is the cutting edge, this is the
[29:28.320 --> 29:31.920]  guy they want to arrest as a Ruski because he actually cares about the country and really
[29:31.920 --> 29:36.240]  is moral, this is the guy they physically attack, this is, you know, if you want us
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.440]  to win, understand we're fighting for you and we need you to spread the word, to pray
[29:40.440 --> 29:46.480]  for us and to financially go to InfoWarsStore.com and buy some of the great products you need,
[29:46.480 --> 29:49.760]  sign up for auto-ship and get 10% off and that way you know you're committed and get
[29:49.760 --> 29:52.200]  a big discount, we'll be right back.
[29:52.200 --> 29:54.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.200 --> 29:55.200]  Round of Stop World War 3 right now.
[29:55.200 --> 30:22.200]  We're going to come up there and do something.
[30:22.200 --> 30:26.240]  Any possible chance whatsoever just to even get outside of their country.
[30:26.240 --> 30:29.760]  I mean, China might have to worry or maybe South Korea but I really don't think anything
[30:29.760 --> 30:33.880]  is going to get that far out of there so I think we're doing okay but either way tensions
[30:33.880 --> 30:39.320]  are high and their warning of a nuclear strike if US aggression continues with the Navy moving
[30:39.320 --> 30:40.320]  towards them.
[30:40.320 --> 30:44.160]  US President Donald Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its impoverished neighbor
[30:44.160 --> 30:48.760]  said in a tweet North Korea was looking for trouble and that we would come and solve that
[30:48.760 --> 30:49.760]  problem.
[30:49.760 --> 30:53.240]  The Americans have escalated sharply on the Korean Peninsula with talk and military action
[30:53.240 --> 30:56.920]  by the United States gaining traction following the strike last week.
[30:56.920 --> 31:00.200]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[31:00.200 --> 31:01.700]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[31:01.700 --> 31:05.600]  It's not just our water we need to filter, it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned,
[31:05.600 --> 31:08.480]  it's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:08.480 --> 31:14.520]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:14.520 --> 31:19.480]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[31:19.480 --> 31:24.440]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:24.440 --> 31:29.560]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:29.560 --> 31:31.280]  you can to purify your air.
[31:31.280 --> 31:36.320]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:36.320 --> 31:39.280]  or avoid most toxic effects to themselves.
[31:39.280 --> 31:45.440]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:45.440 --> 31:49.080]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:49.080 --> 31:52.640]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more
[31:52.640 --> 31:55.840]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.840 --> 32:02.360]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWars.com.
[32:02.360 --> 32:07.280]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:07.280 --> 32:10.640]  before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[32:10.640 --> 32:15.880]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[32:15.880 --> 32:22.040]  bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[32:22.040 --> 32:23.520]  great tasting formula.
[32:23.520 --> 32:24.520]  Caveman.
[32:24.520 --> 32:28.400]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:28.400 --> 32:32.400]  superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:32.400 --> 32:35.040]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:35.040 --> 32:40.240]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[32:40.240 --> 32:44.560]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.200]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[32:48.200 --> 32:52.560]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:52.560 --> 32:56.160]  to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[32:56.160 --> 32:59.680]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[32:59.680 --> 33:18.560]  and ForrestLive.com today.
[33:18.560 --> 33:22.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:22.920 --> 33:37.280]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:37.280 --> 33:41.800]  Last week, the Charlotte Size regime killed even more of its own people using chemical
[33:41.800 --> 33:43.640]  weapons.
[33:43.640 --> 33:48.500]  Our missile strike in response to his repeated use of banned weapons was necessary as a matter
[33:48.500 --> 33:51.640]  of U.S. national security interest.
[33:51.640 --> 33:55.880]  We do not want the regime's uncontrolled stockpile of chemical weapons to fall into
[33:55.880 --> 34:02.080]  the hands of ISIS or other terrorist groups who could and want to attack the United States
[34:02.080 --> 34:09.000]  or our allies, nor can we accept the normalization of the use of chemical weapons by other actors
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.880]  or countries in Syria or elsewhere.
[34:12.880 --> 34:17.400]  The U.S. is grateful for the statements of all of our partners who have expressed support
[34:17.400 --> 34:20.640]  for our timely and proportional response.
[34:20.640 --> 34:26.520]  As events shift, the United States will continue to evaluate its strategic options and opportunities
[34:26.520 --> 34:31.240]  to de-escalate violence across Syria.
[34:31.240 --> 34:35.440]  Many nations look to the Geneva process to resolve the Syrian conflict in a way that
[34:35.440 --> 34:41.640]  produces stability and gives the Syrian people the opportunity to determine their own political
[34:41.640 --> 34:48.000]  future, and our hope is that Bashar al-Assad will not be a part of that future.
[34:48.000 --> 34:53.680]  If the Astana ceasefire negotiations become effective towards achieving a durable ceasefire,
[34:53.680 --> 34:57.640]  then the Geneva process has the opportunity to accelerate.
[34:57.640 --> 35:00.880]  To date, Astana has not produced much progress.
[35:00.880 --> 35:05.560]  It is also clear Russia has failed to uphold the agreements that had been entered into
[35:05.560 --> 35:09.840]  under multiple UN Security Council resolutions.
[35:09.840 --> 35:15.760]  These agreements stipulated Russia as the guarantor of a Syria free of chemical weapons
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.360]  that they would also locate, secure, and destroy all such armaments in Syria.
[35:21.360 --> 35:27.320]  Stockpiles and continued use demonstrate that Russia has failed in its responsibility to
[35:27.320 --> 35:30.600]  deliver on its 2013 commitment.
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.720]  It is unclear whether Russia failed to take this obligation seriously or Russia has been
[35:35.720 --> 35:42.200]  incompetent, but this distinction doesn't much matter to the dead.
[35:42.200 --> 35:46.200]  We can't let this happen again.
[35:46.200 --> 35:51.000]  I'm really proud of Info Wars and our team and our sources, because you notice I said
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.280]  on Thursday and Friday I didn't know exactly what was going on, but we laid out the best
[35:54.280 --> 35:59.200]  info that was out there, and then over the weekend I filed reports telling you exactly
[35:59.200 --> 36:06.040]  what was happening, and on Monday Paul Watson put a report out that President Trump is resisting
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.840]  neocon calls for a no fly zone and a wider war, we can put that article back up on screen.
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.640]  Some of that article is word for word what the president said in meetings, I had that
[36:18.640 --> 36:25.720]  from one source, and then it was what was said in a telephone conversation with another
[36:25.720 --> 36:29.920]  person who I called and checked with.
[36:29.920 --> 36:33.920]  I mean I have my White House sources, we get White House memos, we get a lot of stuff
[36:33.920 --> 36:39.200]  that the rest of the media doesn't get, and so the president by the weekend understood
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.720]  that some of his surrogates and others were running wild pushing a war narrative, so he
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.200]  began to put out the narrative that we're not doing a no fly zone, we're following the
[36:47.200 --> 36:52.120]  old plan, Bashir Assad was supposed to step down after we kicked out Al Qaeda and ISIS,
[36:52.120 --> 36:55.720]  we've got a force there to let him know that he should open up what he said he would do
[36:55.720 --> 37:02.480]  four years ago to have elections once Al Qaeda and ISIS is out of the area, and it was also
[37:02.480 --> 37:07.120]  a strong message that nobody better be using chemical weapons and why weren't those weapons
[37:07.120 --> 37:13.000]  still shipped out of the country, and it was an even bigger message to China and of course
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.440]  to North Korea who were threatening everybody and it was serious threat 50 times worse than
[37:17.440 --> 37:21.400]  what's happening in Syria, Syria is not a threat to the United States, having a war
[37:21.400 --> 37:29.760]  with Russia over it is, so again who started the war?
[37:29.760 --> 37:38.880]  The Clinton controlled Obama-Neocon run Obama White House, that's fact, and so it's our
[37:38.880 --> 37:43.880]  mess and I get Trump says he owns it now, he wants to fix it, and I believe the president,
[37:43.880 --> 37:48.200]  he wants prosperity, he doesn't want a bunch of wars, but we have to have peace through
[37:48.200 --> 37:56.400]  strength, Syria could become a US Russian proxy war, absolutely that's what the experts
[37:56.400 --> 38:00.960]  are saying, it's already been a proxy war for six years, and Russia has the moral high
[38:00.960 --> 38:07.600]  ground, I'm not a lucifile, I'm not an anglophile, I'm not an EU file, I'm an American file,
[38:07.600 --> 38:14.280]  I'm an Americana guy, I love America, I want our sovereignty, I want our taxes cut, I want
[38:14.280 --> 38:21.920]  better deals, Trump has crippled Russia by saying colds back on the table, that dropped
[38:21.920 --> 38:27.920]  down their natural gas prices by half in one day, we're not against Russia, one of the
[38:27.920 --> 38:32.920]  few things Nikki Haley said that's true is Trump strengthening our military and driving
[38:32.920 --> 38:41.040]  down energy prices in Europe, we've got these new super ships that are giant gas tankers,
[38:41.040 --> 38:46.400]  one of those ships loaded has enough gas for a major city like London for a year, it's
[38:46.400 --> 38:53.280]  just insane the amount of liquid gas we've got, so again ladies and gentlemen putting
[38:53.280 --> 38:57.960]  coal back on there, drove down the prices of natural gas, quite frankly it hurt American
[38:57.960 --> 39:04.800]  consumers as well, but sorry coal outweighs all that for our overall energy prices, so
[39:04.800 --> 39:13.080]  that's, when I say consumers I mean people selling gas, I should say producers, but that
[39:13.080 --> 39:17.320]  wasn't enough when Nikki Haley was at the women's world group, bad-mouthing Russia,
[39:17.320 --> 39:22.160]  they booed, they want more, they're liberal women that listen to NPR, and you listen
[39:22.160 --> 39:32.800]  to NPR it's like the anti-Russia channel, it's crazy, okay, but what Rex Tillerson said
[39:32.800 --> 39:40.560]  is very, very encouraging and is word for word what I told you in a memo Sunday on
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.080]  the live show, and one I told you on Monday in Paul Watson's article, that is a transcript
[39:45.080 --> 39:51.480]  that article he wrote that I gave him, and a good three paragraphs are directly out of
[39:51.480 --> 39:57.560]  the president's mouth, and I'm going to stop right there, now Michael Savage believes Trump
[39:57.560 --> 40:03.000]  has made a mistake, I respect Michael Savage, he's one of the smartest people on talk radio,
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.880]  maybe he's right, Savage certainly knows his audience is against it, my audience is about
[40:07.880 --> 40:14.360]  80% against it, all I'm saying is let's not drive a wedge, let's not let the left come
[40:14.360 --> 40:19.440]  in and make Trump think he's lost his base, so that he has to compromise with the globalist
[40:19.440 --> 40:27.000]  and give in when on trade and borders and security and free speech and killing TPP,
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.320]  he is doing amazing things, he's bringing Glass-Geagle back, banking regulation, so
[40:32.320 --> 40:37.840]  the big banks can't sit there and create derivatives, and now let's go to the CNN piece I mentioned,
[40:37.840 --> 40:50.240]  alt-right turns on President Trump, the alt-right deplorable crowd who voted in literally Hitler
[40:50.240 --> 40:55.920]  are turning on Trump because he punished a leader for using chemical weapons on innocent
[40:55.920 --> 41:07.000]  civilians, okay, where's your proof, you have rebels caught doing it, you have ambassadors
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.960]  and former congress people and world leaders saying that it's a false flag that Russia
[41:11.960 --> 41:17.040]  would never be involved in this, you have the neocons and the warmongering liberals
[41:17.040 --> 41:28.800]  calling for war with Russia, how's that for peace, and then you've got CNN taking snippets
[41:28.800 --> 41:33.320]  out of context to make it look like everybody's turned on Trump, when Cernovich has been on
[41:33.320 --> 41:38.000]  air since Friday saying no, he supports Trump, he just doesn't support the people giving
[41:38.000 --> 41:46.880]  him bad info, just like our other guests have said, and Paul Watson is off the Trump train
[41:46.880 --> 41:51.040]  when it comes to geopolitics, not off the Trump train completely, and I never said I
[41:51.040 --> 41:56.760]  was off the Trump train, thank God for Trump, let's just celebrate that globalism is being
[41:56.760 --> 42:00.520]  exposed all over the world, LePen is in the lead to win, she was against this strike by
[42:00.520 --> 42:05.920]  the way, and that great things are happening worldwide and that Trump already got a good
[42:05.920 --> 42:10.280]  Supreme Court justice in, and let's just thank God for how we move the ball down the
[42:10.280 --> 42:17.120]  field, and we don't know everything Trump knows, it'd be so easy for me to just sit
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.640]  here and go oh yeah, Trump's horrible, he sold us out, he's all bad, and then we all
[42:20.640 --> 42:25.640]  turn away from politics, turn away when we've got critical battles on more Supreme Court
[42:25.640 --> 42:29.880]  nominees, on getting the tax cuts we want, on getting Obamacare repealed that now Rand
[42:29.880 --> 42:35.400]  Paul's haunt showing, and all these other great things when he's done so much, three
[42:35.400 --> 42:39.560]  trillion in the stock market, 300 billion in new jobs announced, hundreds of major companies
[42:39.560 --> 42:45.160]  coming back, do I need to announce all this, shing that the extremist bureau of the FBI
[42:45.160 --> 42:49.060]  isn't going to target Americans and patriots and only focus on radical Islam, exposing
[42:49.060 --> 42:54.080]  the fact that they won't expose radical Islam, trying to block people from seven unvetted
[42:54.080 --> 43:01.320]  countries who don't even have real passports, failed states like Libya and Sudan and Somalia
[43:01.320 --> 43:08.200]  where they sell women on slave auction blocks, and where we have, who's that Oliver guy,
[43:08.200 --> 43:12.960]  and I forget all their names, the late night guys, and co-bear, they've all made jokes
[43:12.960 --> 43:19.000]  like what's a slave block, and Jones claims that slavery's still going on, it's sick,
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.720]  it's sick, when I have it in the news today, International Business Times, there's video
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.600]  coming up, migrants are being sold at open slave markets in Libya, I'm just informed
[43:27.600 --> 43:33.560]  folks, I know so many men that are as smart as I am, but you go to their house, they've
[43:33.560 --> 43:36.960]  got all these footballs, all these baseballs, all these jerseys, all they want to talk to
[43:36.960 --> 43:41.280]  you about is football games, and do you want to go to the World Series with them, do you
[43:41.280 --> 43:44.840]  want to go play golf with them, and I go, I'm going to spend time with my children,
[43:44.840 --> 43:50.880]  or I'm going to hike, I'm going to swim, I'm going to barbecue, I'm going to be involved
[43:50.880 --> 43:55.920]  in charities because that makes me feel good, just an instinctive level, be giving back,
[43:55.920 --> 44:04.320]  and I can't live in a fantasy world, you know what Babe Ruth hit in 1937, you know what
[44:04.320 --> 44:14.560]  Strawberry hit in 1972 or whatever, I mean, you know what Nolan Ryan did in 1991, I'm
[44:14.560 --> 44:18.700]  sorry, it's not that I don't like baseball, I start watching it and I'll end up being
[44:18.700 --> 44:24.360]  obsessed with it, I played baseball, we're about to have nuclear war with North Korea,
[44:24.360 --> 44:30.960]  I've got children folks, I'm a normal man that, men are designed to understand factoids
[44:30.960 --> 44:37.400]  and information and stats and topography and all this knowledge we have to build things
[44:37.400 --> 44:43.560]  to create a civilization, but also to analyze threats, and so that's what I do, and I built
[44:43.560 --> 44:48.440]  info wars to take on the globalist that I knew we're trying to take over our country
[44:48.440 --> 44:54.560]  and destroy our freedoms, and look what one man did in 22 years interfacing with other
[44:54.560 --> 45:00.440]  men and women and listeners who cared, look what we built with this little focal point,
[45:00.440 --> 45:04.400]  that's why they're so scared of what we do, that's why we need your prayers, we need your
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.320]  support because the enemy knows we're the tip of the spear, they know we're walking
[45:08.320 --> 45:15.720]  point, and I'm here telling you, do I have any respect with anybody out there, that Trump
[45:15.720 --> 45:21.360]  overall is good, they hate him, he would never have done the things he did, it's irrevocable,
[45:21.360 --> 45:25.680]  his defeat of the media discredits them, they totally hate him, the things he's able to
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.400]  do, the things he's gotten done are seismic, I'm getting the biggest chills in my life
[45:30.400 --> 45:41.360]  right now, I know in my gut that Trump's for real, can he be compromised, can he be manipulated,
[45:41.360 --> 45:48.920]  can he be killed, absolutely, can he go sideways, can he get confused, is he 70 years old,
[45:48.920 --> 45:53.360]  absolutely, but it isn't about Trump, it's about us, and we can't sit there whether
[45:53.360 --> 45:57.480]  he goes forward or sideways or backwards and make it all about him, we gotta make it about
[45:57.480 --> 46:01.480]  what are we doing in city councils, what are we doing in legislatures, what are we doing
[46:01.480 --> 46:05.640]  on air, have you started a YouTube channel, have you started your own blog talk radio,
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.880]  have you started your own local access show, maybe used to be in radio, have you gone and
[46:09.880 --> 46:15.640]  just told local stations, I wanna do a show and I'm gonna get some sponsors, where's
[46:15.640 --> 46:20.840]  your hunger, don't just say thank God Alex Jones is there and then not stand up, I need
[46:20.840 --> 46:25.880]  you, no matter what you got, black skin, brown skin, red skin, pink skin, I don't, you got
[46:25.880 --> 46:31.480]  red blood, don't care if you're a man, a woman, whatever, to have some energy and to take
[46:31.480 --> 46:37.360]  action and to focus on the globalist and what they're doing, Trump's not the enemy, Trump's
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.720]  imperfect but he's already moved the ball down the field and won some major victories,
[46:42.720 --> 46:49.880]  we don't rise and fall with him or LePen or Farage or Matt Drudge or Alex Jones or anybody
[46:49.880 --> 46:57.040]  else, we rise and fall on you and your relationship with God and your will to take action against
[46:57.040 --> 47:01.480]  evil, so here's singing in celebrating, oh the alt-rights mad, oh the alt-rights, you
[47:01.480 --> 47:06.800]  know, well you know what, at least we have a conscience, let's play the club, here it
[47:06.800 --> 47:07.800]  is.
[47:07.800 --> 47:12.320]  President Donald Trump ordering a military strike in Syria was like a punch to the gut
[47:12.320 --> 47:17.640]  for the alt-right, a group of Trump's most loyal supporters who in part voted for him
[47:17.640 --> 47:24.360]  because of his anti-war stance, the alt-rights anger on display in a storm of online tweets,
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.960]  Trump's base of support is gone if he goes to war with Syria, wrote blogger and author
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.880]  Mike Cernovich, just as the strike on Syria was beginning, these people are totally turning
[47:33.880 --> 47:40.000]  on Trump. Alex Jones, founder of the conspiracy-driven info wars website, said after the strikes
[47:40.000 --> 47:44.840]  he'd give Trump the benefit of the doubt, but still tweeted, we are closer to the start
[47:44.840 --> 47:51.360]  of world war three than we have been in decades, along with the hashtag, no war in Syria.
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.760]  In a separate tweet he asked if Trump's strike on Syria was a sign of betrayal, and then
[47:56.760 --> 48:03.880]  this question, Trump train headed to destination disappointment, hashtag, Syria strikes. I asked
[48:03.880 --> 48:09.920]  the question, why would Trump get a chemical weapons depot with thousands of tons of chemicals?
[48:09.920 --> 48:15.680]  Infowars editor Paul Joseph Watson also railed against Trump, tweeting, I guess Trump wasn't
[48:15.680 --> 48:21.000]  Putin's puppet after all, I'm officially off the Trump train. Right-wing commentator
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.600]  Ann Coulter, who campaigned for Trump, tweeted her dismay, those who wanted us meddling in
[48:26.600 --> 48:32.400]  the Middle East, voted for other candidates. And this reminder, Trump campaigned on not
[48:32.400 --> 48:38.480]  getting involved in mid-east, said it always helps our enemies and creates more refugees,
[48:38.480 --> 48:45.720]  then he saw a picture on TV. Even as far back as 2013, Trump said he was against US involvement
[48:45.720 --> 48:51.280]  in the Middle East. He tweeted then that Obama should save his powder, pleading with him,
[48:51.280 --> 48:57.560]  to not attack Syria. This tweet from a veteran to Donald Trump was a clear sign his supporters
[48:57.560 --> 49:03.960]  had lost patience with his predecessors, and perhaps him too. It reads, no more regime
[49:03.960 --> 49:10.360]  changes, no more American dead, no more nation building, it's what you ran on.
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.800]  Even before the US strike, some of Trump's alt-right base were even selling the idea
[49:14.800 --> 49:20.080]  that the chemical attack on the Syrian people was a hoax. Blogger Mike Cernovich started
[49:20.080 --> 49:23.360]  a hashtag Syria. It paused back in a second. Michael Savage just
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.320]  come out with a post on infowars.com. Michael Savage turns on Trump, says Syrian gas attack
[49:28.320 --> 49:33.400]  was a false flag. Well, I love Michael. Notice we said it last Wednesday, and we had the
[49:33.400 --> 49:36.640]  first article out on it. To want to point out, we're the trailblazers. That's why we're
[49:36.640 --> 49:41.560]  under attack, just like we exposed the CIA planning evidence of Russian stuff. We told
[49:41.560 --> 49:45.440]  you that months before, it was in the hill today. Let's go back to the piece.
[49:45.440 --> 49:50.800]  The idea that the chemical attack on the Syrian people was a hoax. Blogger Mike Cernovich
[49:50.800 --> 49:55.800]  started the hashtag Syria hoax and info wars began referring to the attack as a false
[49:55.800 --> 50:00.880]  flag, suggesting it was only meant to draw the United States into a war. The hashtag
[50:00.880 --> 50:07.680]  Syria hoax was reportedly an attempt to convince Trump to stay out of Syria. When he didn't,
[50:07.680 --> 50:13.720]  to make his point, Blogger Mike Cernovich stayed live online for 11 hours, slamming
[50:13.720 --> 50:18.600]  Trump's decision. If we're going over Syria, I'm moving to Argentina. If Trump is going
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.320]  to bring us to war, then that means there's no hope for America. No hope for America or
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.960]  no hope for alt-right Trump supporters who may suddenly be wondering if their president
[50:28.960 --> 50:35.120]  is a dove or a hawk. So now the most demonized group in America,
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.640]  coined by Hillary Clinton and my dark heart, remember dark heart speech or alt-right, what
[50:39.640 --> 50:45.200]  was the dark heart speech? Now the worst people in America are against World War III and we
[50:45.200 --> 50:49.600]  made up false flag, even though Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin, the British ambassador, everybody
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.640]  else are coming out, Michael Savage saying it's a false flag. We're all evil and you're
[50:53.640 --> 50:58.960]  all the good moral Democrats that want war. Yay, you can watch your white helmet shows
[50:58.960 --> 51:04.040]  on Netflix. They say you can't take on the man and win.
[51:04.040 --> 51:07.640]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their

[54:27.320 --> 54:33.160]  the world and the situation in Korea or Syria, whatever area you'd like to get to, what you
[54:33.160 --> 54:38.440]  think of Trump, but also what you think we should, you know, push for in the agenda,
[54:38.440 --> 54:41.880]  the lower taxes, controlling our borders. We should also talk about the things we're
[54:41.880 --> 54:46.000]  thankful for. If we're going to attack Trump, then let's also talk about what he's done
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.240]  that's good. Because believe me, if Hillary was in right now, they'd already had their
[54:49.240 --> 54:52.960]  new Supreme Court justice in and they would have their way with the American people on
[54:52.960 --> 54:57.760]  the second amendment, on taxes, on everything you can imagine. So let's thank God for the
[54:57.760 --> 55:02.760]  reprieves we've gotten. We have come so far from where we were just five years ago. Just
[55:02.760 --> 55:06.120]  five, six years ago, the public didn't know the Federal Reserve was private. They didn't
[55:06.120 --> 55:11.320]  know about global government. All of it's admitted now. And once it's out in the open
[55:11.320 --> 55:15.680]  that a foreign world government's running things or the EU's not elected, then they
[55:15.680 --> 55:21.960]  are forced to go to force with the head of the EU, Yunker, the Nazi air, saying, I will
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.360]  invade you. I will take you over. I will break up America. I am in charge. You will submit
[55:27.360 --> 55:36.440]  to me. Good. Go ahead and try it. So that's all. That's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:36.440 --> 55:41.320]  I'm going to kick the next hour off with the huge news in China. It is so over the top
[55:41.320 --> 55:44.920]  with North Korea threatening to nuke our carrier task force. They're the ones taken
[55:44.920 --> 55:48.600]  over the South China Sea. They're the ones boarding ships. They're the ones threatening
[55:48.600 --> 55:53.640]  to attack countries. Under international law, the United States could nuke China and Korea
[55:53.640 --> 55:58.800]  right now. The media says I'm calling for that. No, I'm not. But we have a first strike
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.480]  doctrine of somebody aims missiles at us and says they may add us first. You point a gun
[56:03.480 --> 56:07.880]  at somebody, you put your finger on the trigger and you say, I'm going to shoot you. I have
[56:07.880 --> 56:12.640]  every damn right in the world to pull my gun and shoot you. I don't want to have a nuclear
[56:12.640 --> 56:21.800]  war. CNN, right wing watch, all you other liars. There it is. Reuters, Fox News, recent
[56:21.800 --> 56:26.160]  developments surrounding the South China Sea. Let's go back and show them that headline.
[56:26.160 --> 56:30.800]  With North Korea threatening to nuke the task force. There it is. North Korea, state media
[56:30.800 --> 56:34.520]  warns of nuclear strike and provoked as U.S. warships approach. We ought to arrest Hillary
[56:34.520 --> 56:39.160]  and Bill right now. They're the ones that signed off and got personal money for transferring
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.720]  the nuclear reactors to them in the mid-1990s. That was all over the news at the time. But
[56:43.720 --> 56:54.640]  because I have a memory that's 22 years back from 1995, 96, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[56:54.640 --> 56:58.400]  We told you before it was in the WikiLeaks, the CIA was staging fake cyber attacks on
[56:58.400 --> 57:02.760]  the U.S. How do we know? Cyber command six years ago admitted they were launching fake
[57:02.760 --> 57:07.560]  cyber attacks to get agencies to go along with it. That's how arrogant they are. All
[57:07.560 --> 57:12.000]  right, let me just stop there. We need your support. We need your prayers. We're running
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.720]  a special I've never seen. I saw this today. I don't know who came up with this because

[58:19.480 --> 58:28.920]  day. That's 40% off the regular price. It's superdeal at 216 smackers, okay? At $129,
[58:28.920 --> 58:34.000]  nothing is even close. I happen to know. I think we're buying those for like $120. So
[58:34.000 --> 58:40.280]  this is a Lost Leader 5-Star review, a perfect 5-Star review. InfoWarsStore.com, a bunch

[58:51.680 --> 58:57.520]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLive.com, Biotru Selenium. We've had so many requests
[58:57.520 --> 59:03.560]  over the years for selenium. And just recently, we were able to source a certified organic
[59:03.560 --> 59:09.440]  bioavailable selenium from Mustard Seed Extract. When you take selenium in the body, it actually
[59:09.440 --> 59:14.840]  benefits the detoxification systems in your body. It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[59:14.840 --> 59:19.880]  It helps detoxify. Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves. The highest
[59:19.880 --> 59:23.880]  concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the
[59:23.880 --> 59:29.720]  body. As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon
[59:29.720 --> 59:36.320]  selenium. So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs. I'm taking it
[59:36.320 --> 59:42.120]  now every day. This is so key. Biotru Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we
[59:42.120 --> 59:45.520]  could bring you. We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price. Exclusively
[59:45.520 --> 59:54.360]  available at M4WarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[59:54.360 --> 1:00:03.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:03.160 --> 1:00:09.600]  They took my saddle and years to broke my leg in the Santa Fe.
[1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:11.080]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:13.080]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend.
[1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:20.080]  Well, I sure did. In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:23.080]  I'll be looking afraid when they pull that in.
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:27.880]  You know all the bad stuff happening in my life? I look back on it. Oh, maybe who I am.
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:32.480]  You could hear that when I was a kid and rolled my eyes at it. You could hear how great Texas
[1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:36.960]  was and how great America was and rolled my eyes at that until I actually traveled the
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:41.440]  world. We got a lot of problems, but the elite want to shut us down for a reason. Let's
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:48.440]  listen to George Strait for a moment. Put the American flag up front for a second.
[1:00:48.440 --> 1:01:07.440]  Up from San Antonio, everything I got is just what I've got on. I ain't got a dime. I ain't
[1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:16.440]  got a dime, but what I got is my time. I ain't rich, but Lord, I'm free.
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:23.760]  My oldest daughter years ago, she likes George Strait. Who wouldn't? She said, Daddy, George
[1:01:23.760 --> 1:01:32.880]  Strait, I read it in Texas Monthly. He's rich. More records than the Beatles. And, you know,
[1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:38.600]  he doesn't have a dime, but he's super rich. That's a song about a poor rodeo or sweetheart.
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:44.160]  She goes, oh, I thought he was lying. I said, no, it's a story to illustrate something,
[1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:52.320]  but the richer you get, if you're still tied into God, you realize that you are poor financially.
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:59.120]  Money means nothing. More money, more problems. It is so satisfying in my life to take 95%
[1:01:59.120 --> 1:02:04.600]  of the money comes in and to put it back into studios and crew and people and to change
[1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:08.360]  the world. I mean, I would be embarrassed. And I'm not against guys that do it because
[1:02:08.360 --> 1:02:12.200]  they're beautiful, cool cars. And I'd love a black Ferrari. I'd love to drive around
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:18.480]  in a car that can go 250 miles an hour. And they're really cool. But see, so many jerks
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:23.360]  drive it to look cool and to make themselves look like they're the most powerful people
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:29.320]  on earth that I couldn't be associated with that. Plus, what's the point of that? Not
[1:02:29.320 --> 1:02:36.400]  saying you're bad if you have that. Because there's so much going on in the world. Why
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:41.000]  wouldn't you put that money towards changing the world? That's what I'm saying. A lot of
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.720]  folks have old cars, classic cars. It's art and people make money off of it and it's
[1:02:44.720 --> 1:02:48.960]  a living. That's totally cool. I'm not a class envy person. I'm all about people having
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:52.760]  wealth to be self sufficient, independent, help themselves and others. It's just that
[1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:56.640]  things can't be your God. I'm going to come back with the big North Korea news, but I
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:01.120]  can't cover it in the short segment. News so big, I can't believe we're even reporting
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:06.440]  it. I mean, quite frankly, if I was a selfish man, I would be on an airplane with my children
[1:03:06.440 --> 1:03:15.200]  out of this country to the South Pacific. I'd literally be trying to move somewhere
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:23.800]  as far south as you can get. Do you know what? If we run like that, bad stuff's going to
[1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:27.680]  happen. I started plugging last hour and I really don't plug enough because I meet with
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:31.560]  the accountants and stuff and I'm just transparent about it. And the media and David Brock and
[1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:35.640]  all of them celebrated and they've got more tricks up their sleeves and I understand that.
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:39.680]  We really have never really even pressed the accelerator financially. We always just want
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:45.440]  to bring in enough to expand as we, you know, grow properly and the God's working in mysterious
[1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:52.200]  ways here. But you donate by taking care of yourself, taking care of us and getting products
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:56.400]  you need. Quite frankly, we have lost leaders. I've told them to do it, but I've never offered
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:04:02.080]  40% off that I can remember on a pro pure system. So that's just unprecedented. So quite frankly,
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:08.320]  we don't make money on that. So I mean, just look at this review. I loved it from the beginning,
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:12.360]  looks real fancy in the kitchen. I use it whenever I want great tasting room temperature
[1:04:12.360 --> 1:04:16.120]  water. You put it over ice too. I use it for me and make your ice cubes with it. I use
[1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.880]  it for all baby bottles and food filters fairly quickly. It takes a little while because it's
[1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:27.000]  a real filter with the five filters maintenance is easy and first use prep is quick and simple.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.440]  That's Tony in Massachusetts. Yeah, if you're not filtering your kids water and it doesn't
[1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:33.600]  mean sometime they're not going to drink something that didn't filter, but just as much as you
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:37.040]  can cut back and filter the water, it's number one thing you can do other than putting a
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:42.320]  gas mask on your kids. A lot of particular x2 is is selling out. We're running out of
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:46.040]  the deep earth crystals. That's just a fact. And we're going to be out for a while. And
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:50.920]  this run is out. We got a new small run that came in the great halogen. I would stockpile
[1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:54.200]  that if I was you and support the broadcast. And we have a lot of other great products
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:59.120]  caveman's back in 33% off the brownboth tumeric B pollen formula.
[1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:07.880]  Hey, this is Joe Biggs. And today, Vladimir Putin says us preparing to bomb Syrian capital
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:14.080]  and will blame devastation on Bashar al-Assad's forces. Sounds like someone's been watching
[1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:22.400]  MSNBC. Seriously, guys, we should be Putin. Our differences Assad. Either way, Vladimir
[1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:26.400]  Putin is sensationally claimed that the US preparing airstrikes on the Syrian capital
[1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:32.920]  and will pin the blame on Bashar al-Assad's forces. You hear that? That's right. Those
[1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:38.080]  are owls and crickets because the left doesn't have any more Russia Russia Russia Russia.
[1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:42.520]  The story that's been dead for a long time, but really died last week when Tomahawk missiles
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:48.060]  hit Syria. The Russian leader made the astonishing claim that the US is planning to fake chemical
[1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:54.000]  weapons attacks during a joint press conference with the Italian president Sergio Mattarella.
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:02.880]  You can find more reports like this at infowars.com. I'm Joe Biggs. After being sold out for months,

[1:08:16.280 --> 1:08:22.920]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex
[1:08:22.920 --> 1:08:49.760]  Jones show. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of a massive fight for the future,
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:56.120]  not just of this republic, the United States of America, but the entire world hangs in
[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:05.200]  the balance. Powerful forces of evil, communist China, the EU unelected dictatorship and the
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:11.560]  globalist combine are attempting to start a war between the United States and Russia,
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:20.320]  their two main adversaries. The globalist are allied with radical Islam and have been
[1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:30.120]  staging events to destabilize Europe, Google, Facebook, Twitter, the EU governments have
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:36.560]  banned showing jihadis raping, stabbing, shooting, murdering and running over citizens every
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:43.000]  week on average. There are car attacks, but you saw the images of the dead kids from the
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:50.600]  chemical attack was not a sarin attack. The people treating them were not wearing equipment.
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:55.000]  Two days after sarin, you get near somebody that's been hit with it. It'll kill you.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:00.640]  There's some type of chlorine gas, ladies and gentlemen, and that's the type of gas used
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:08.520]  by the rebels. Were the rebels cooking it up? Were the rebels preparing it? Was all that
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:15.480]  going on? Absolutely. Chlorine gas, you just wear a mask. You're not wearing full gear
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:23.120]  and you touch somebody that's been hit with sarin, you're going to die or wish you had.
[1:10:23.120 --> 1:10:26.640]  They're there washing them off with water hoses and not even wearing rubber gloves,
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:37.280]  ladies and gentlemen. Why would the Russians or the Sarians hit themselves?
[1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:48.080]  And now Michael Savage has joined Info Wars, yours truly, Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin, the
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:57.560]  British ambassador, Peter Ford, and countless others that have the anti-gold fish complex.
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:04.080]  It's called a memory. Everybody else should remember that they have one.
[1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:10.160]  Up on infowars.com, Steve Watson has an article detailing it with a video. Putin says that
[1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:19.360]  the first attack is a false flag just like the one a few years ago and that it's not
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:24.400]  sarin but chlorine. Any idiot can see that? And that he believes there are going to be
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:29.600]  more provocations to suck Trump in and that's where Trump's been caught. I get saying, don't
[1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:33.000]  use chemicals. I get shutting off the talk that he's a Russian agent. I get looking
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.760]  strong for North Korea and China. I know what McMasters told him, but what did the British
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:42.560]  ambassador tell you? Let's go to him first. What did he say? He said, you've given the
[1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:51.560]  jihadis a thousand percent reason. Everybody calls them al-Nusra al-Qaeda. The British intelligence
[1:11:51.560 --> 1:11:57.960]  calls it right. They're called jihadis. So they're called in England. You've given, by
[1:11:57.960 --> 1:12:03.160]  the way, England set the jihadis up 100 years ago, they know, out of Saudi Arabia. The ambassador
[1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:09.280]  is telling you, you've given the jihadist a thousand reasons to now stage false flags
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:13.800]  when they're famous for doing it, blowing up other people's masks, blowing up their
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:19.360]  own, blaming it on people to cause civil wars. They've been caught. Let's go back to the
[1:12:19.360 --> 1:12:26.680]  BBC, finally telling the truth once. Here it is. And based on previous experience, including
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:34.760]  Iraq, we can see that we cannot take at face value what the so-called intelligence experts
[1:12:34.760 --> 1:12:40.440]  tell us, not when they have an agenda. But come back to the main point, but it's not
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:46.720]  going to end here. And we are likely written to be dragged into it because Trump has just
[1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:55.520]  given the jihadis a thousand reasons to stage fake flag operations, seeing how successful
[1:12:55.520 --> 1:13:05.280]  and how easy it is with a gullible media to provoke the West into intemperate reactions.
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:10.800]  They will very likely stage an operation similar to what they did. And this was documented
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:17.800]  by the United Nations in August last year. They mounted a chlorine gas attack on civilians
[1:13:17.800 --> 1:13:24.240]  and they tried to make it look like it was a regime operation. This marked my words. You
[1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:30.800]  are hearing it here. And it will happen and we'll get all the warmongers coming to tell
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:37.120]  us that Assad is defying us and we must go in more heavily into Syria. This will be fake
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:41.440]  flag. And again, I've talked to chemical weapons
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:45.080]  experts. We should probably get some of them on here. They've emailed me. They've called
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:48.800]  me, people that I've interviewed many times. And they've said, look, Alex, you're not wearing
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:52.680]  gloves. Look, it dissipated quickly. Sharon, you can't go around there for days. And if
[1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:55.720]  people have been hit with it, you can't even touch them. You've got doctors and people
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:58.360]  that's in there. That's chlorine gas that you can make. I'm not going to tell you how
[1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:02.920]  to make it, but it's easy to make. You can go to the hardware store and in one hour
[1:14:02.920 --> 1:14:06.040]  make chlorine gas. And let me tell you, it'll make you wish you were dead and it'll kill
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.360]  you. Houston's had chlorine gas get out before and kill a bunch of people. Chlorine gas is
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:13.880]  one of the biggest problems you see at refineries. This is a derivative of some of the refining
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:20.240]  processes. But what I'm getting in here is, before I get into Korea, the big enchilada
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:29.320]  about the numbers is that we had the jihadis putting out stuff saying, tomorrow we're going
[1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:35.680]  to start a major campaign claiming we're being hit by gas. And then the base that had the
[1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:42.680]  gas got hit. The problem is the Russians won't talk about what they're up to and what they're
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:46.200]  doing. They don't tell anybody. It'd be nice if the Russians announced right when they
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:51.240]  hit it. By the way, we had a chlorine gas facility, but they didn't do that because they probably
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:54.080]  weren't involved and probably didn't even know they were getting ready for this big
[1:14:54.080 --> 1:14:57.840]  attack. They just saw a bunch of movement. The Russians did with the surveillance and
[1:14:57.840 --> 1:15:00.720]  said they're getting ready to do something to hit that compound and had chemicals in
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:08.000]  it. And that's just what happened, folks. It wasn't Saren. It was chlorine gas. Somebody
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.400]  gets hit with Saren. You touch them. You get it on you. You're going to die. You get one
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:21.000]  little piece of it on your skin. You're going to either have major brain damage or be dead.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.560]  And again, they got caught last year doing it. They got caught in 2013 doing it. They'd
[1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:29.040]  been caught over and over. Let's go ahead and go to Vladimir Putin saying the same thing
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:32.480]  and that they're getting ready for another bigger provocation. So what does Trump do
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:36.400]  when the next provocation comes? That's why Michael Savage is saying he's wrong and others.
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:39.760]  He's painted himself into a corner and we're not saying that because we're out to get the
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:46.120]  president or we think he's a bad guy. He's been trapped by McMasters. Here it is.
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:52.520]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:57.080]  anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including
[1:15:57.080 --> 1:16:03.160]  the southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again prepared to release some similar chemical
[1:16:03.160 --> 1:16:09.240]  substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them. But we regard that any such
[1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:15.480]  incident would be reason enough for a thorough investigation. We are preparing to make a formal
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:20.960]  call to the relevant UN agency in The Hague and call on the international community to
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:27.480]  investigate thoroughly these incidents and depending on the results of the investigation
[1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:33.520]  to make informed decisions and take meaningful action.
[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:37.880]  The world is at the greatest point of World War III threat since the Cuban Missile Crisis,
[1:16:37.880 --> 1:16:45.440]  but it's not just in Syria. That's as bad as the Cuban Missile Crisis. We are now witnessing
[1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:51.080]  a major care and task force group, Nukes being moving to South Korea and open calls by North
[1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:55.520]  Korea for nuclear war. This is an incredible crisis point and come back from break. I'm

[1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:32.840]  gotta cut you down. Sooner or later gotta cut you down. Go tell that long-tongued liar. Go and
[1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:39.960]  tell that midnight writer. Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back fighter. Tell them that God's
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:50.360]  gonna- Ladies and gentlemen, tell them that God's gonna cut them down. Well, my goodness,
[1:24:50.360 --> 1:24:59.800]  communist China holds the title for the most people ever killed by a government. According to
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:07.400]  the communist Chinese themselves, Mao Zedong killed 84 million people during the Cultural
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:15.080]  Revolution and the Great Leap Forward. The CIA says it's 66 million. Then another 20 plus million
[1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:21.160]  are believed to have been actually executed or put into forced labor camps till they died.
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:26.280]  Another 10 million or so are thought to have just been starved to death
[1:25:26.280 --> 1:25:30.200]  since Mao went out of power. So you do the numbers. We're talking well over.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:37.880]  Any way you slice it, 100 million dead people. Back in the 60s and 70s, China would threaten the
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:42.280]  United States publicly. I remember my dad reading the newspaper when I was like six years old and
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:46.440]  they'd say, let us have a nuclear war. We got too many people. That's why they signed on with
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:50.680]  the Rockefellers and eugenics to have the one-child policy and kill almost all the baby girls.
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:57.800]  Just 50 million, they're saying, just the last decade. Nobody knows the full number.
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.080]  Now, there's one independent Mao's great leap forward. Just one of his projects killed 45
[1:26:03.080 --> 1:26:10.280]  million in four years alone. Yeah, that's four years. He was in power from the 1930s to 1949
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:16.520]  when he got full power over China right through to when he died in late 70s. So you think about that,
[1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:21.880]  45 million in four years, baby. So that's why they're so dangerous. And by the way,
[1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:28.680]  the Chinese will fight like the devil if you get in a war with them. The problem is they run out of
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:36.600]  food real quick. Now, North Korea is this horrible demon state run for three generations by Chinese
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:43.000]  puppets. It's a redditary dictatorship, completely psychotic. They believe they're God. Kim Jong-un
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.800]  actually believes he's invincible. His father believed he was invincible. They are the essence
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:54.600]  of pathetic scumbags. And they look at the South, probably the richest country per capita in the
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:27:02.200]  world for technology, you name it. And they just get completely jealous and hateful.
[1:27:02.200 --> 1:27:07.720]  They, the elites of North Korea look at Japan and all its wealth and they get completely absolutely
[1:27:07.720 --> 1:27:13.960]  hateful. And there's an anti-Japanese hatred because the Japanese obviously occupied Korea
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:21.160]  and killed a lot of people and forced labor to everybody. So there's a lot of ancestral
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:26.280]  and cultural beefs here. It's like a gang fight. It's like the Crips versus the Bloods or whatever.
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:36.840]  I mean the Hancocks versus the McCoy's. This is lined up and never since the July 27th, 1953
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:45.320]  ceasefire on the DMZ between the North and South has there ever been this much of a crisis. You
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:52.840]  have North Korea threatening when the carrier task force arrives in the next four days to
[1:27:52.840 --> 1:27:59.000]  launch a nuclear weapon into the South China Sea on board one of the missiles that they claim they
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:06.760]  can load an atomic warhead on. Now they're telling the superpower with over 50,000 nuclear weapons.
[1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:11.720]  It's not 10,000. Let me give you a news flash. Space-based weapons, particle beams, meteor guns
[1:28:11.720 --> 1:28:18.760]  with DU Sabos. And that's the stuff that's leaked they've got. That's 1980 stuff. They're telling
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:23.800]  the most crazy elite on the planet, the Anglo-Americans. The ones GMO-ing everything. The
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:27.800]  ones, I mean, you know, just super sophisticated breakaway civilization group.
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:34.520]  You've got this guy. They can't even produce automobiles in South Korea. They can barely feed
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:39.000]  themselves. But thanks to Clintons and the globalists, they wanted this done as the trigger.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.080]  In the 1990s, 95, 96, 97, they gave them the reactors to create the weapons.
[1:28:43.080 --> 1:28:50.280]  They are now threatening and have been every week in the last few months launching a medium-range
[1:28:51.320 --> 1:28:57.720]  missile into the South China Sea with 900 kilometer ranges right off the coast of Japan.
[1:28:57.720 --> 1:29:02.360]  I mean, the coast, people on the coast of Japan can see a big rocket come in and blow up in the
[1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:07.880]  ocean. Imagine the Russians were off our coasts or somebody or the Mexicans and shooting something
[1:29:07.880 --> 1:29:14.920]  up in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of, you know, let's say Galveston. I mean, how upset you'd
[1:29:14.920 --> 1:29:19.560]  be as the Japanese are. And they want to be peaceniks, believe me. They got A-bombs dropped on them,
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:25.560]  but they're ready to go to war. You have this crazy little fat guy, the essence of government
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:32.600]  worship. What a poster boy for big government and how it doesn't work. You've got him calling for
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:35.400]  all this. I'm going to roll through it and go to your phone calls on the other side and look at
[1:29:35.400 --> 1:29:40.440]  how this could go down. But here's the headline. Trump orders military advisors to prepare plans
[1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:45.800]  to hit North Korea. And our media is making fun of South Korea panicking.
[1:29:48.600 --> 1:29:53.640]  The capital, CO, is only 30 miles from the border. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.520 --> 1:29:57.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:57.320 --> 1:30:07.640]  North Korean dictator fling flang flume. I mean, Kim Jong-un warns of a nuclear strike. It provoked
[1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:13.160]  as US warships are now approaching the Korean peninsula. So tensions are heating up right now.
[1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:17.240]  Little man's going to decide to come out and pop off a few if he thinks that we're going to come
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:21.880]  up there and do something. I actually think it's kind of funny. I don't think that North Korea has
[1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:27.000]  any possible chance whatsoever just to even get outside of their country. I mean, China might have
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:30.920]  to worry or maybe South Korea, but I really don't think anything is going to get that far out of
[1:30:30.920 --> 1:30:35.480]  there. So I think we're doing okay. But either way, tensions are high and their warning of a
[1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:40.840]  nuclear strike if US aggression continues with the Navy moving towards them. US President Donald
[1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:45.720]  Trump has urged China to do more to rein in its impoverished neighbor said in a tweet North Korea
[1:30:45.720 --> 1:30:50.440]  was looking for trouble and that we would come and solve that problem. Tensions have escalated
[1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:54.520]  sharply on the Korean Peninsula with talk of military action by the United States gaining
[1:30:54.520 --> 1:31:00.040]  traction following the strike last week. You can find more reports like this at info wars.com.

[1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:43.560]  But it wasn't because I didn't see enough. I knew too much. Does that make me crazy?
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:48.440]  Yeah, it does for those that aren't informed. Does that make me crazy?
[1:33:48.440 --> 1:33:56.200]  It's made me crazy that I told you a month before anybody else did that it was in the
[1:33:56.200 --> 1:34:01.080]  vault 7 that the CIA was spying on the American people and then staging cyber attacks on the
[1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:07.400]  American people. Of course I told you about that years ago. Does it make us crazy? We told you
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:14.440]  that all evidence pointed towards a false flag last week with a nerve gas in Syria. Now everybody
[1:34:14.440 --> 1:34:21.160]  else is saying it. Putin waited five, six days. We told you minute one.
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:31.160]  Bless your soul. You think you're in control?
[1:34:31.160 --> 1:34:43.480]  Well, I think you're crazy. We're not bragging here. We're telling you the reason we're under
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:51.400]  attack. Our information warfare is based in the truth and it's on target. And so we are your
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:58.840]  champion. We'll make something clear here. Why are we the champion? Because of you.
[1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:03.320]  You are the people that support us that spread the word that give us the intel.
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:07.960]  You're the reason we're here. You're the reason info wars got built.
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:14.840]  So you are the champion. Think about that. All right, I want to go to your phone calls
[1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:18.520]  pretty quickly here and I can go over more of these articles and clips as we take calls from Dan
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:23.960]  Russell, Patrice, Dominic, Matthew and others. As soon as you hear somebody hang up, you can call
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:33.080]  triple. That's the other number. You can call 800-259-9231-800-259-9231. We're teleprompter free
[1:35:33.080 --> 1:35:38.040]  TV slash radio coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas. So let me just read these headlines.
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:45.080]  Trump orders military advisors to prepare plans to hit North Korea.
[1:35:47.640 --> 1:35:51.000]  Government tries to calm South Korean's fear of imminent war.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:58.360]  That only makes the public get more concerned. They're 30, it's actually 30 kilometers. It's
[1:35:58.360 --> 1:36:07.320]  like 22 miles or whatever, 23 miles from the North Korean border. Think about how crazy that is.
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:14.920]  And they've got 100,000 pieces of artillery that Kim Jong-un claims and our government says he has
[1:36:14.920 --> 1:36:23.320]  pointed at Seoul to level it in a matter of hours, one of the most popular cities in the world.
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:27.480]  I forget how many people are in Seoul, South Korea. Can we look that up? It's like eight million or
[1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:35.160]  something. Meanwhile, Reuters exclusive North Korean ships head home at Regina orders coal return. This
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:48.520]  is good news. Now I'm told we have him on the phone right now.
[1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:52.920]  Sure. Does he want to talk to me?
[1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:56.200]  Sure.
[1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:02.600]  You know, we already played Paul Watson's report. I want to go to these phone calls,
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:08.920]  but I need to do this too. Let me just get back to this for a moment. North Korean ships head home
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:15.160]  after China ordered coal returned. A fleet of North Korean cargo ships is headed home to the
[1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:19.960]  port of Nampo. The majority of it fully laden at Regina ordered its trading companies to return
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:25.240]  coal to the isolated country following repeated missile tests. And it goes on to say this is
[1:37:25.240 --> 1:37:30.840]  China doing economic sanctions as they promised our North Korea saying stop threatening to New
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:35.560]  Japan. Stop threatening the new South Korea. Stop threatening to nuke the fleet. Stop it.
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:40.520]  This is really good news. The problem is the word is China doesn't completely control North
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:45.560]  Korea and Kim Jong-un is crazy. He thinks Dennis Rodman's cool. What does that tell you? North
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:49.160]  Korea state media warns of nuclear strike and provoked as US warships approach.
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:58.040]  You can ask is Trump establishing the war party? We've got all that. I'm going to go right to
[1:37:58.040 --> 1:38:06.360]  your calls after we play this short report. It's John Bowne. One of Assad didn't gas his own people.
[1:38:06.360 --> 1:38:10.200]  Well, I think you've got everybody in the world saying that that's the case. We've got all the
[1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:13.960]  evidence and the rest of it, but I'm going to play this John Bowne report. Then I promise
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:19.400]  when we have guests next hour, I cleared the tables, cleared the decks today. We might have a
[1:38:19.400 --> 1:38:23.400]  special guest popping in, but we'll see. And we're going to play this John Bowne report,
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:27.000]  one of our great investigative journalists. And then we're going to come back and I promise to
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:33.480]  write to Dan Russell, Patrice Dominic, Matthew and others. But here is John Bowne's report.
[1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:40.600]  The Pentagon released this map hours after 59 Tomahawk missiles were unleashed on the Syrian
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:48.440]  airbase where the chemical weapons carrying plane had reportedly originated from. There is no doubt
[1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:55.960]  in our minds and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syria regime,
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:39:00.760]  and the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad are responsible for this attack.
[1:39:01.880 --> 1:39:07.880]  And I think further it is very important that the Russian government consider carefully their
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:14.040]  continued support for the Assad regime. Russia is supposed to have removed all the chemical
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:20.440]  weapons from Syria, but obviously that has not happened. As innocent Syrians continue to be
[1:39:20.440 --> 1:39:26.200]  murdered in chemical attacks. Let's think about the possible reasons for Russia's failure.
[1:39:27.240 --> 1:39:32.760]  It could be that Russia is knowingly allowing chemical weapons to remain in Syria.
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:38.360]  Now officials are taking it one step further as they look into whether the Russians may have
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:43.240]  played a part in the chemical attack. The Boston Globe reports on Friday,
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:49.960]  senior U.S. military officials said a drone belonging to either Russia or Syria was seen
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:55.240]  hovering over the site of the chemical weapons attack after the assault earlier this week.
[1:39:55.240 --> 1:40:01.560]  Of course, anyone paying attention to the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime's opposition
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:08.280]  is leery of the Pentagon's evidence, especially since previous evidence points yet again to
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:15.400]  American ally Saudi Arabia. Foreign Policy Initiative reported as early as June 2012,
[1:40:15.400 --> 1:40:21.480]  the New York Times spoke with unnamed U.S. and Arab intelligence officials who said that Saudi
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:27.560]  Arabia along with Turkey and Qatar was paying for weapons being funneled through secret channels
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:34.200]  to Syrian rebel fighters. In February 2013, the Times reported sizable small arm shipments
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:41.000]  that Saudi Arabia financed and through third parties provided to anti-Assad fighters in Syria.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:47.800]  Notably, this material support was directed towards nationalist, moderate, Islamist or secular
[1:40:47.800 --> 1:40:53.960]  groups largely under the banner of the free Syrian army. We might not have much of a job here today
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:59.320]  because I looked at the New York Times to find out to get the explanation and they said,
[1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:05.640]  worst chemical attack in years in Syria. U.S. blames Assad. It's all over and done with.
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:13.800]  But not quite so easy, is it? What happened four years ago in 2013, you know, this whole thing
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:19.320]  about crossing the red line. And ever since then, the neocons have been yelling and screaming,
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:25.640]  even part of the administration is still yelling and screaming about Assad using poison gases on
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:30.760]  his people four years ago. Not quite true. Who would benefit? It makes no sense, even if you
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:36.440]  were totally separate from this and take no size of this and you were just an analyst,
[1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:41.560]  it doesn't make any sense for Assad in these conditions to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:48.600]  I think it's a zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately.
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:53.560]  Saudi Arabia was connected to a nerve gas attack using mortars. Their Wahhabis wanted to be rock
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:58.920]  stars, though, so they videotaped themselves, launching the chemical attacks, jibbering about it
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:06.040]  and uploaded it the same day. We have a number of instances where ISIL has used chemical munitions
[1:42:06.040 --> 1:42:12.440]  on the battlefield. In 2012, the Syrian government was warning that the rebels could resort to chemical
[1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:20.200]  attacks after Al-Nusra stole 200 tons of toxic chlorine from a factory in Aleppo. In 2013,
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:26.920]  12 members of Al-Nusra were arrested with two cylinders of sarin gas. A lot of the reports
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:33.640]  are coming from the so-called White Helmets NGO, which is door source funded. It's receiving UK and
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:42.280]  US tax dollars and they've been filmed carrying al-Qaeda flags around, taking part in executions,
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:50.600]  hanging out with the child beheaders of the Nur al-Zinqi group, one of the rebel groups that
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:57.400]  the CIA vetted and gave weapons to, which ended up beheading a child. The White Helmets, as we
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:03.800]  now know very clearly, are the same individuals that are with al-Qaeda. They just put on a White
[1:43:03.800 --> 1:43:09.960]  Helmet and suddenly they're no longer al-Qaeda. In 2014, the US and Russia implemented an agreement
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:16.200]  to destroy the Syrian government's stockpile of chemical weapons. The BBC writes the destruction
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:24.040]  of the arsenal began on 6th of October, overseen by the OPCW, the organization for the prohibition
[1:43:24.040 --> 1:43:30.520]  of chemical weapons. On the 31st of October, the international watchdog confirmed that Syria's
[1:43:30.520 --> 1:43:36.360]  declared equipment for producing, mixing, and filling chemical weapons had been destroyed.
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:42.280]  The full blown reality is the chemical weapons attacks in Syria aren't going to stop,
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:48.600]  even if Assad is ousted, ignoring the well-known role of Saudi Arabian support for a network of
[1:43:48.600 --> 1:43:55.080]  anti-Assad rebels capable of stockpiling their own chemical weapons is equivalent to a dog
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:44:00.520]  chasing its tail. So let's say we get Assad and they get regime change and Assad's gone and now
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:04.760]  there's going to be a new government. Who will that government be? One of the leaders of the
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:09.880]  Islamic army, which was one of the many, many different groups fighting against Assad, trained
[1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:18.360]  in Damascus at a Wahhabist radical Islamic preacher infested university funded by the Saudis. Do we
[1:44:18.360 --> 1:44:23.960]  really think he was going to be better than Assad? There are two million Christians in Syria
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:31.400]  protected by Assad. In fact, the Christians that were in Iraq so hated the war and so hated the
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:36.520]  government that we helped institute upon them, they all fled went to Syria. But now that you've
[1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:42.440]  got Donald Trump, they can kill two birds with one stone. One, if they can get Donald Trump to
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:48.680]  start World War Three, then they can blame him for it. And suddenly it's not a globalist puppet
[1:44:48.680 --> 1:44:53.240]  that has to take the blame, that has to get up on television, explain away this. Yes. They know
[1:44:53.240 --> 1:44:58.680]  that they can destroy Donald Trump and his entire supporters and label them as the people who started
[1:44:58.680 --> 1:45:07.480]  World War Three. And of course, as Vladimir Putin has said, as the British ambassador has said,
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:12.200]  and as I've said, and as Ron Paul said, and as everybody said, I said a month and a half ago
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:15.800]  when McCain went over there secretly and came back, I said, is he getting another fake chemical
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:21.640]  attack ready? They've had at least four. One that the UN totally confirmed happened.
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:27.800]  Others that the rebels admitted they did. What's going to stop them from staging more stuff?
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:33.800]  This only encourages it. This is all one-on-one game theory, folks. It's not even very hard.
[1:45:34.680 --> 1:45:37.400]  But being a critical thinker is called being a conspiracy theorist.
[1:45:38.200 --> 1:45:41.720]  We're going to go to Russell, Dan, Patrice, Dominic, Matthew and others right now.
[1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:44.200]  Russell from Alaska. Russell, thanks for calling.
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:51.880]  Hi, sir. Just real quick, I wanted to say this is more of a message towards the president himself.
[1:45:51.880 --> 1:45:58.440]  Over the years we were in Iraq and Afghanistan, I'm an army veteran myself. I spent almost 12 years
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:06.680]  in the military. We lost almost 7,000 soldiers over there alone. That's not counting the guys
[1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:11.160]  that came home but actually died over there already.
[1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:15.480]  That's right. From all the chemicals and the biologicals and the and the DU,
[1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:17.320]  not to mention 22 suicides a day.
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:28.440]  Exactly. And for what? We left. Nothing changed over there other than the fact that
[1:46:29.720 --> 1:46:35.240]  you have a radical Islamic terrorist over there that are killing people daily.
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:39.000]  We can't make the same mistake again.
[1:46:39.720 --> 1:46:43.560]  I just don't know how Trump goes along with the story that's obviously fake.
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:47.560]  And then we have the very Al Qaeda people celebrating what he's done.
[1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:51.000]  And I don't want to criticize the president. He's doing good on a lot of domestic stuff.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:56.200]  It's just that, you know, I'm sorry, every veteran I know, everybody I know basically is against this.
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:01.880]  No, and sir, and I agree with you. I don't, I disagree with what he did, but
[1:47:01.880 --> 1:47:05.560]  he's still the president and I will support him and back him because I voted for him.
[1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:11.320]  Let me raise this next point. I've studied the Korean War, looked at it in depth,
[1:47:11.320 --> 1:47:16.280]  talked to all the experts. They agree. This is the biggest crisis ever since 1953 in the ceasefire.
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.840]  What do you make of this? This, this craziness because that's China and that's Korea starting all this.
[1:47:22.200 --> 1:47:25.960]  Yes, sir. I did two tours in Korea. I'm one in 2006 and one in 2009.
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:36.040]  And 2006 and both 2009 he launched rockets. I believe in 2006 he sank a South or Kim Jong-il,
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:41.560]  I believe it was, shank of Korean fishing boat. And in 2009 they murdered one of the islands
[1:47:41.560 --> 1:47:49.080]  off the South Korean shores. I don't know his son. I know that Kim Jong-il, he was a lot of flair,
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:53.880]  but I don't know his son. And you know, it worries me because I still have friends there.
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:48:02.200]  And I just, I just don't know. Well, listen, I mean, this will quickly escalate in a nuclear war.
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:08.200]  Kim Jong-un saying he will use the nukes he has in the missiles to hit the U.S. fleet that's out
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:12.040]  there. Obviously we've got aircraft that can shoot those missiles down, but if he shoots a missile
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:16.120]  in the South China Sea near our ships, what is Trump supposed to do at that point?
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:21.160]  Well, at that point, you don't have, he doesn't have a choice, you know.
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:26.520]  So I tend to agree. I think, I think Tillerson came out today and said,
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:29.400]  we don't want war with Syria. Al Qaeda is the main issue. ISIS.
[1:48:29.400 --> 1:48:34.440]  And I think that's going back to his campaign promises. So I think we're seeing some positive
[1:48:34.440 --> 1:48:38.840]  things out of Trump right now. And that's what I was told this weekend and on Monday by White
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:42.200]  House sources that are absolutely as close to Trump as you can get.
[1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:46.280]  Yes, sir. And so like I said, the whole point I'm calling is, look,
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:50.520]  we don't want another situation like Iraq and Afghanistan with Syria.
[1:48:51.080 --> 1:48:53.240]  We didn't make any ground there. We're not going to make any ground
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:59.320]  in Syria. North Korea, look, if they started, you know, I'm always wanting to say,
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:03.400]  if you're going to start it, I'm going to finish it. And that's what has to happen.
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:08.360]  That's what has to happen. But I support our president, even if I don't agree with everything
[1:49:08.360 --> 1:49:13.960]  he does. Well, we better support him now exactly because we've got China and North Korea threatening
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:19.800]  war and just crazy behavior going on. So what's happening is our president's being tested.
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:23.960]  And folks, we're not in the position he's in. If he was trying to put bad justices in,
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:27.960]  if he'd have put a bad justice in a liberal justice, or if he wasn't trying to cut our taxes,
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:32.280]  or he wasn't getting all these factors to come back, I'd say he was a fake. He's doing so good on
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:38.520]  the domestic front that I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt while I criticize issues I see
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:44.120]  with Syria, hoping he gets better advice. Do you see what I'm saying? Yes, sir.
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:50.040]  Yes, sir. God bless you, Russell. I appreciate your call. Yeah, it's a serious situation
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:54.840]  to say the least. I mean, we don't want war with Russia. And Russia says more missiles get
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:59.240]  fired at their bases, their troops, they're going to respond. And the Russians tend to do what they
[1:49:59.240 --> 1:50:06.120]  say they're going to do. So I can go to Matthew, Dominique, Patrice, and others, but I've got to
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:10.600]  go to break. When I come back, I'm going to talk to Dan and Indiana. And then we're going to talk
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:15.400]  to Patrice, Dominique, Matthew, and others right into the next hour. And we may have some surprised
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:19.160]  guests today. We'll see what happens with that. There's an article up on info wars.com that just
[1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:26.280]  went up by Jerome Corsi. Dr. Jerome Corsi. Why AG Sessions must stop charges against Arpaio?
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:33.560]  Total kangaroo court garbage against Arpaio, illegal spying on him, a guy doing his job,
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:42.600]  an admitted Obama UN witch hunt. And they haven't even dropped the fake federal contempt charges
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:47.080]  that put him in jail for three years against our pile of former federal officer with no criminal
[1:50:47.080 --> 1:50:53.640]  record and a great record. But it gets worse than that. They won't even get rid of the IRS chief
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:58.040]  that openly went after patriots and people for no reason. I mean, it's just just Trump has full
[1:50:58.040 --> 1:51:04.440]  meeting against him. Sick and tired of being sick and tired, family health and education

[1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:15.080]  I know our clock's weird. It's because I never wanted to do news and air mainstream news on
[1:54:15.080 --> 1:54:18.680]  the show. So I said, well, let stations have their news and we'll air our ads and we'll come
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:22.520]  in at eight after. I'm going to change the clock soon back to regular talk radio clocks,
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:28.120]  going to let the stations know about that and get that all set up. But that eight after next hour,
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:32.040]  they have a very, very special guest joining us to break down what's currently happening in the
[1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:41.000]  world. Right now, let's go back to your phone calls. Let's talk to Matthew in California around the
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:47.400]  year. Hey, Mr. Jones, how are you doing, sir? I'm telling you, I'm just thinking about my kids
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:54.200]  here and seeing how dangerous the world is. Yeah, you know, I totally understand. I'm going to
[1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:59.800]  jump to my perch really quick. I'm very disappointed with this whole serious situation. Point number
[1:54:59.800 --> 1:55:05.880]  one, it's unconstitutional. It's one thing for him to, you know, just bomb one little facility
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:10.120]  because supposedly there's chemical weapons in there. But now I'm hearing that we got boots on
[1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:16.280]  the ground and we have no approval from our Congress, which is a break on his promise not
[1:55:16.280 --> 1:55:20.600]  to get involved in international conflicts that have anything to do with us. No, I agree, but
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:24.840]  he's been tricked into that. And now you, like I told you on Sunday and Monday, he's going to come
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:29.320]  out and say, I don't want war. I want the old deal. I want my old campaign. He was told we need
[1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:33.400]  ground forces to take out Al Qaeda and ISIS, which is true. But now the joint chiefs are
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:37.800]  turning around saying, let's get rid of Assad. Now, Tillerson's come out to the old deal and said,
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:42.040]  no, we're not wanting to topple him. We want to get rid of Al Qaeda, ISIS, then we'll get him to
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:46.920]  move towards doing that on his own. But, but I totally agree with you. Listen, here's how dumb
[1:55:46.920 --> 1:55:51.160]  down the public is. The media is making fun of me saying there's not boots on the ground,
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:55.560]  even though I have thousands of articles the last two months admitting massive U S troops
[1:55:56.280 --> 1:56:03.480]  are moving in Marines, artillery, army, all of it is moving into Syria and into Western Iraq. So,
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:09.960]  so it's on. Well, who's he listening to with this stuff? Because I, because I remember back when
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:16.120]  Obama was in, and he wasn't allowing our military to, to actually effectively go after ISIS in
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:21.800]  Syria, that our military was secretly or, you know, covertly giving information to the Russians
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:26.680]  so that they could actually go at them because our military knew that the Russians and the Assad
[1:56:26.680 --> 1:56:31.880]  regime were going after the. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Six years ago,
[1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:35.720]  our military said told Obama, and in five years ago was when it came to a head, we're not going
[1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:40.280]  to back Al-Qaeda and ISIS, they staged Benghazi to get weapons in their five years ago. That was
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:45.800]  all of that. Our military finally woke up said, no, we're not doing this. And then Trump comes in
[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:50.280]  and then the military starts trying to back out of its deal. And that's, it's pretty much
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:54.760]  McMaster from what I've been told. A lot of folks are blaming Tillerson. Tell us or Tillerson,
[1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:57.560]  Rex Tillerson is the one that's backpedaling right now. What do you think?
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:57:07.080]  Well, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, basically one of two things is Donald Trump
[1:57:07.080 --> 1:57:11.080]  not paying attention to what's going on. Does he honestly believe that it was?
[1:57:11.080 --> 1:57:16.280]  Sir, he's ordered him to do all this stuff and the bureaucracy is ignoring him. And then he's
[1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:21.080]  hiring people that say they'll do what they say. And then they go on the news and say,
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:24.920]  we're going to take a sought out. And Trump says, I didn't say that. They come out the next day and
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:29.800]  say Trump doesn't want that. They're doing what they want. There's a whole mutiny against Trump.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:43.080]  He already had his first national security advisor that orchestrated this whole deal with Russia
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:49.480]  to not back Al Qaeda removed. Then he, three guys he asked said, no, he was stuck with McMasters.
[1:57:49.480 --> 1:57:55.400]  I'm not trying to demonize McMasters, but he says radical Islam isn't Saudi Arabian and stuff like
[1:57:55.400 --> 1:58:01.000]  that. So I've got some serious issues with him, Matthew. Personally, Matthew, I'm just glad that
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:07.480]  all this stuff is getting de-escalated right now because China and North Korea are the big problem.
[1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:12.440]  That's what can end our world. You could wake up during a nuclear war. You could be driving on the
[1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:17.480]  highway and here, you know, emergency alert system on the radio. And 10 minutes later,
[1:58:17.480 --> 1:58:23.320]  ICBMs detonate at 2000 foot air burst. And then guess what? You're playing a heart, brother.
[1:58:24.920 --> 1:58:33.880]  Pushing daisies. You are. You are. Big target is the main Pacific Navy space there.
[1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:38.920]  You are right. So am I. Central Texas, Fort Hood. There's probably hundreds of nukes pointed at me
[1:58:38.920 --> 1:58:48.440]  right now. They'll be back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today.

[1:59:49.800 --> 1:59:56.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:25.240]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Pepper Pavlovsk, turning south out of North Cape,
[2:00:25.240 --> 2:00:31.320]  bearing 095 degrees. Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[2:00:32.360 --> 2:00:38.840]  From the front lines of the information war. Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[2:00:38.840 --> 2:00:47.880]  We are at DEF CON 1. Are you prepared to destroy the enemy? You bet! Defending the Republic from
[2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:53.320]  enemies, foreign, and domestic. We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:13.800]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. All units confirm weapons targeted and ready,
[2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:19.560]  awaiting launch codes. We are in launch mode. Do you really believe that the enemy would attack
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:25.800]  without provocation? If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. We're in.
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:31.080]  Russians are still denying everything, sir. We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[2:01:31.080 --> 2:01:45.400]  I wish I didn't know about any of this. I wish I was like everybody else. There's a certain type of
[2:01:45.400 --> 2:01:52.120]  person like Adolf Hitler that thinks they're invincible and wants to start big wars. And
[2:01:52.120 --> 2:01:58.040]  clearly we've got some people in the neocon and top democratic echelons that just think they're
[2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:02.440]  invincible. And they want to dominate Russia, they want to dominate China, and there's other
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:07.480]  crazies like them on the other side, like North Korea, and they're the type of people that will
[2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:11.560]  destroy our world. We have another big global war. It's going to be nuclear, and then we're all by.
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:18.040]  And people say, oh, well, it hadn't happened since the nuclear weapons proliferated by the 1950s,
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:25.800]  so it's not going to happen. Statistically, and they've got algorithms that show this,
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:32.200]  the bigger the population, the more they proliferate weapons. It's like my dad was born in 1950.
[2:02:33.160 --> 2:02:36.600]  Now, is there a lesser or higher chance he's going to have a heart attack or get cancer as he gets
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:44.360]  older? As he approaches 70 years old, same thing with my mother, born the same year. No, there's
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:50.200]  a bigger chance they'll get a heart attack or cancer. God forbid. Well, as you get more degenerate
[2:02:50.200 --> 2:02:54.920]  leaders and more nuclear weapons and more craziness and more and more, and we don't have these nuclear
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:02:59.960]  wars and there's no racial memory of losing 21 million Russians or 21 million Germans. Funny,
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:04.280]  both sides killed the same number. That's why C. Pachinik said, quite frankly, America won in World
[2:03:04.280 --> 2:03:10.440]  War II. Both my grandfathers were, both of them almost got killed. Yeah, it was real, but 600,000
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:17.240]  dead Americans ain't 21 million dead Russians. The truth is, World War II was between the Russians
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:24.120]  and the Germans. We fought the Japanese, but they were a formidable adversary, but just different,
[2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:30.360]  different. Now, if you were going up Iwo Jima, if you were going up a hill and you know, 10,000
[2:03:30.360 --> 2:03:35.880]  Marines die going up one hill, damn right, that's a war. I'm not lessening any of that. I almost
[2:03:35.880 --> 2:03:41.480]  don't exist. One grandfather, a fighter pilot crash landed and almost died. The other one
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:45.000]  flew his missions and then got heat stroke. Thank God, because three missions later, he went on the
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:52.920]  plane and blew up over Germany. That isn't what traumatizing was being in Italy. They put him
[2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:59.080]  over supply stuff, seeing all the starving kids and everything else. He never went to restaurants
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:02.200]  and ordered food again. I remember when I was a little kid, he wouldn't order food. Everything
[2:04:02.200 --> 2:04:06.120]  people didn't eat, he ate it. Kind of a good sister though. He got a little pizza with everybody
[2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:13.880]  at. He saw starving children. See, there aren't people alive right now that have seen the big
[2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:19.560]  wars. Yeah, our veterans have seen it. And every veteran I talked to, including super right-wing
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:27.000]  people, super anti-Islamic folks, they say this Syria thing stinks bad. We need to stay out of it.
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:33.640]  We're on the wrong side. Obama started it. The neocons are for it. Come back with your calls.
[2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:38.040]  We have a special guest joining us on the other side of this break. Kind of the man of the hour
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:43.480]  right now. And then we will continue with your phone calls throughout the transmission. And then
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:48.920]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from her botanic majesties London. By the way, he's going to be here
[2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:54.440]  next week co-hosting with me and David Knight. So that's all coming up. I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:58.040]  is the most sinister side on the internet because it's so accurate. Spread that link.
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:09.480]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false flag and more are
[2:05:09.480 --> 2:05:16.280]  on the way. We have information from various sources that are similar to provocation. And I
[2:05:16.280 --> 2:05:20.920]  can't call it anything other than a provocation is being prepared in other parts of Syria,
[2:05:20.920 --> 2:05:25.880]  including the southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again prepared to release some
[2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:31.960]  similar chemical substances and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them. Putin went on to
[2:05:31.960 --> 2:05:38.680]  compare the situation in Syria to Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction,
[2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:45.480]  which may indicate that he believes the U.S. is either behind the false flag or actively pushing
[2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:51.800]  the propaganda. Meanwhile, the Russian government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons
[2:05:51.800 --> 2:05:58.120]  and any further attacks in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable. And you can learn

[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:20.200]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[2:07:20.200 --> 2:07:23.960]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows

[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:25.480]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:33.080]  It's Alex Jones. Well, Ron Paul has come out and said it was a false flag chemical attack. The
[2:08:33.080 --> 2:08:39.560]  former top British ambassador has come out and said that it was a false flag attack. Peter Ford,
[2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:42.680]  he said now the jihadis will launch more false flags and draw Trump in.
[2:08:42.680 --> 2:08:48.360]  Vladimir Putin has come out and said it, but it hasn't gotten any attention like Michael
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:53.160]  Savage, best-selling author, probably the number one or number two talk show host in the United
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:58.120]  States, coming on the broadcast right now exclusively in about an hour. He hosts his own
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:09:03.800]  broadcast despite the fact he's under the weather. His new best-selling book, Trump's War, warns on
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:09.800]  page 233, Trump's War Against the Deep State, and he warns in the chapter, I read the book a month ago,
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:14.760]  of them trying to get him into war. So that's why they call him Dr. Savage. I won't go into all his
[2:09:14.760 --> 2:09:20.680]  degrees, medical degrees, you name it, but exclusively it joins us here, Zero Hedge.
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:26.040]  Roger Port has it. Michael Savage turns on Trump. It says Syrian gas attack was false flag.
[2:09:26.040 --> 2:09:31.320]  I don't think it's turning on Trump. It's warning Trump. Maybe I'm wrong, but CNN's saying he's
[2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:35.160]  turned on Trump. I don't want to put words in his mouth. I haven't gotten his total view on this,
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:40.600]  but Dr. Savage of michaelsavage.com, am I wrong to say you haven't turned your desk Trump?
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:45.960]  That's the vermin in the left, trying to divide and conquer once again. It's the garbage of,
[2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:53.000]  the garbage of the world in the media. Absolutely. The trash, the filth, the sludge,
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:57.320]  I never turned on Trump. Now, I don't know whether we can reach Trump. That's the problem.
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:00.200]  I don't know who he's listening to. Well, I did talk to, let's just say,
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:04.360]  I did get what the president thought this week, and I'll tell you later. I know you just had dinner
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:07.640]  with him a few weeks ago, but let's, let's just, you've got the floor, sir. So,
[2:10:07.640 --> 2:10:10.120]  so just roll this out. Why are you so concerned?
[2:10:10.120 --> 2:10:15.160]  The old ones who see this. Let's start with all the people you mentioned, but let's go the other
[2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.560]  way. Who is supporting this? The worst people on the planet are saluting Trump. So, Reed Zachariah,
[2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:26.600]  Mr. Crazy Eyes, Lindsey Graham, the weirdest man in the history of the Senate,
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:30.680]  Sean McCain, the psycho when he, when he speaks, you could see insanity.
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:35.240]  They're all saluting Donald Trump. These are the people we hated before the election.
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:40.120]  These are the people we rejected during the election. Now they're on Trump's side,
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:46.040]  along with these, the crypto pseudo conservatives in the radio business who hold themselves up
[2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:51.240]  as great conservatives or were screaming for war. Alex, the world is upside down.
[2:10:52.120 --> 2:10:55.640]  If you can keep your head while all those around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:10:59.480]  then you'll be a man, my son. Greatest, one of the greatest lines ever written,
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:04.200]  something I've carried with me since I'm 18 years old. If you can keep your head and all those
[2:11:04.200 --> 2:11:07.800]  around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, then you'll be a man, my son. Alex,
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:12.360]  we are being tested like we have never been tested before. I don't know how we've come
[2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:15.800]  out of this because I don't know if Donald Trump is listening to a word anyone is saying to him,
[2:11:15.800 --> 2:11:23.240]  other than this, this inner cadre around him, somebody has turned him. Now let's look at the
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:30.440]  big picture. In the period of only one week, because of a few propaganda photos of a terrible
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:37.400]  tragedy conducted by, we don't know whom, the president has now launched wars and threatened
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:44.680]  wars against three nations, China, Russia, North Korea. But more than that, Alex, here's
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:50.920]  the strangest part of it all. For a smart man, why would he conduct these absurd,
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:56.520]  limp-wristed missile strikes while the Chinese guests are sitting with him at Mar-a-Lago?
[2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:01.720]  Does anyone not understand protocol? Do they not understand diplomacy? Do they understand
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:05.400]  that's probably one of the greatest breaches of diplomacy I've ever seen in my lifetime?
[2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:09.800]  This was like saying to the Chinese, hello, small, stupid men with shiny heads.
[2:12:10.600 --> 2:12:14.760]  Are you enjoying my meal? Well, F you, because I've just launched missiles. Now what do you
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:21.000]  have to say about it? What kind of presidency is this? I will agree. I'll agree. It's very,
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:26.600]  very, very provocative. Well, you're being more diplomatic than I, which is saying an awful
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:29.960]  lot. Maybe it's because I have the flu and I have the fever and I'm not thinking clearly.
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:35.240]  No, you're thinking very clearly. In fact, every veteran I talk to, every person I talk to, I say
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:40.440]  85% of the audience is absolutely freaked out about what's happening. And I'll tell you who
[2:12:40.440 --> 2:12:44.280]  you know who he listens to. I'll tell you who Trump listens to. Late at night, they've taken
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:48.440]  his phone away. They only let negative stuff go on Twitter. He doesn't get any positive comments
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:52.920]  there. He would do feedback there. He listens to Michael Savage. He listens to info wars. He looks
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:58.360]  at drudge report, probably more than us combined. Let's just say it. So how does he listen to me
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:04.520]  if I'm off of the air? He, he goes and finds clips on YouTube. I know for a fact the point is,
[2:13:04.520 --> 2:13:09.880]  the point is, is that he, he does listen to you. I got a phone call this weekend from somebody.
[2:13:09.880 --> 2:13:13.240]  I'll just leave it at that saying we're not going to do it. No fly zone. We're not going to have
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:17.880]  war. Rex Tillis is going to come out and dial this back. Some people have been speaking on their own
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:21.320]  and notice Tillis has now done that. I said that Sunday. I said that Monday. It's now
[2:13:21.320 --> 2:13:25.240]  happened. I don't want to sit here and brag and try to sound big, but just he is listening to you.
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:30.600]  So speak directly to the president. Go ahead. Oh my God. Well, hello, President Trump. You said
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:35.320]  I should live another 25 years when you put your arm around me at Mar-a-Lago. I hope you mean it
[2:13:35.320 --> 2:13:41.800]  because I can use another 25 minutes the way I feel. My feeling is this, Tillis and his misleading
[2:13:41.800 --> 2:13:48.440]  you. I have no idea why people don't see through that man. It seems to me that it's so plain that
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:54.920]  you don't have to be a genius to see what happened here. What does ExxonMobil gain if they cut Syria
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:59.560]  out of the gas lines that are running out of the Middle East to Europe? What does ExxonMobil gain
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:06.760]  by that, Alex? That's the whole story to that channel. It's another war for oil. It's all over
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:12.680]  again. It's the same thing as 1999. Remember when Bill Clinton was mercilessly bombing the
[2:14:12.680 --> 2:14:19.560]  Serbian people? Yes. For the Muslim. In 1999, the oilie tracks run through Kosovo. It was a little
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:26.840]  noticed article. My heart was broken because Bill Clinton engaged in 78 of the worst days of my life
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:35.480]  until now. Where Bill Clinton mercilessly bombed Serbia. He blew up hospitals. He blew up train
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:41.960]  stations. He blew up every bridge on the Danube River for one reason, and that was to steal Kosovo
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:49.080]  from the Serbs to permit an oil pipeline to run through Kosovo. What's even worse about that story
[2:14:49.080 --> 2:14:55.320]  is the same exact elements that are now on the side of war were on the side of war then, and the
[2:14:55.320 --> 2:15:00.920]  same same people and rational people who cared for the stability of the earth, for the stability of
[2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:07.720]  their families were against that insane act by Bill Clinton. I have not changed my position. It's
[2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:14.760]  the same exact thing. We cannot let crazed businessmen who put their bottom line ahead of the survival
[2:15:14.760 --> 2:15:21.400]  of the planet. I'm talking about Rex Tillerson to rule this nation. Did you vote for Rex Tillerson?
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:27.560]  No. What's his name on the goddamn ballot? No. Did you ever hear of that chrome magnet? No.
[2:15:27.560 --> 2:15:35.400]  Who ever heard of that throwback? Where did he come from? Where the hell did that throwback come
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:42.120]  from? That lowbrow looks like he crawled out of a pit somewhere. Any monster? We can say all the
[2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:47.960]  things we want. I did not elect him to the presidency. I didn't kill myself for a year. I
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:53.160]  have total faith in Donald Trump, and I'll repeat right now what I said to him. I would do anything
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:58.840]  for that man. I have total faith in him. But I don't understand how he cannot see through
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:04.120]  all the president's men. They're misleading him. They're taking him down a road. He cannot come
[2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:09.160]  back. Absolutely. That's what my... If he loses you and he loses me, tell me what happens next.
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:14.600]  That they'll destroy him and he has to know that his base is upset. But let's expand on that.
[2:16:14.600 --> 2:16:18.200]  The British ambassador, I want to ask you this question, to Sirius said, listen,
[2:16:18.920 --> 2:16:22.360]  he's not to the side. It's perfect. We're on the side of Al Qaeda and ISIS. They're celebrating
[2:16:22.360 --> 2:16:27.080]  this. They're going to stage more stuff they got caught in 2013. They got caught last year.
[2:16:27.080 --> 2:16:33.000]  It's official. They videotaped that these jihadis want to be rock stars. They videotaped launching
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:37.080]  the chemical attacks. It wasn't sarin. It was chlorine gas because the doctors are taking
[2:16:37.080 --> 2:16:41.960]  care of them without gloves. Putin has come out and said it's a false flag, and he says more is
[2:16:41.960 --> 2:16:46.840]  planned. And that's what the British ambassador and Putin who are smart are saying is, we don't
[2:16:46.840 --> 2:16:51.480]  want war. We want to de-escalate this. What are you going to do now, Trump, when the jihadis stage
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:56.920]  more stuff this time in Aleppo or in the suburbs of Damascus, and then the right wing, you know,
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:17:01.880]  left wing neocons, whatever you want to call them, rhinos, the war mongers like McCain and Graham,
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:05.960]  say, President, you've got to do something. They have painted him into a corner.
[2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:13.560]  What more do you need to know than the crazy eyes of him? Let's look at the man with the craziest,
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:19.480]  most beset, deceitful eyes in me. Zarkarius. Zachariah, one of the sickest looking faces I've
[2:17:19.480 --> 2:17:24.920]  ever seen. If you were to create a puppet of deceit and hatred for America, it would be Fareed
[2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:31.240]  Zarkariah. Now, Fareed Zarkariah. Gradulating Donald Trump. Lindsey Graham, one of the most twisted
[2:17:31.240 --> 2:17:38.200]  sisters in the history of the Senate, a totally twisted Nancy, is now encouraged by the Trump
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:46.920]  administration. John McCain, who looks like what he is, a totally sad, broken man walking around
[2:17:46.920 --> 2:17:52.440]  like the puppet of the defense establishment, saluting him. And listen to this, Alex. Again,
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:58.040]  you don't have to be a genius to add up the pieces. All of the never-Trumpers, the weekly
[2:17:58.040 --> 2:18:05.800]  standard crowd, all the never-Trumpers are now saluting him. How is that possible? How did this
[2:18:05.800 --> 2:18:14.520]  happen? Who was advising our great president? I killed myself. I sacrificed my career to help
[2:18:14.520 --> 2:18:20.760]  the people go out, to help motivate the people who were nice. The other thing is, I got people who
[2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:26.440]  sat out elections to go out and vote for him. That's the whole point. And so did you. These
[2:18:26.440 --> 2:18:31.480]  are the people who gave up on the system a long time ago. We saw an outsider. Why did I push so
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:38.120]  hard for Donald Trump? I defied it in one of my books by saying, life with Trump, death with
[2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:44.840]  Clinton. I said, one thing alone, amongst all, is why I'm pushing for Trump. And that is, we will
[2:18:44.840 --> 2:18:49.960]  not have a war with Russia. Well, I'll say this, Mr. Savage of michaelsabbage.com and World Net Daily.
[2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:54.680]  Whatever happens here, you have children, angry children, I have children. We've proven we're
[2:18:54.680 --> 2:19:02.440]  moral. Look at the left, cheerleading and Pelosi and all the usual suspects coming out, not just,
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:09.080]  you know, Farid Zarkaria, not just George Soros, but all the usual suspects, the worst people like,
[2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:14.680]  like Chuck E. Schumer and all them are praising him, sitting there when they want to destroy him.
[2:19:14.680 --> 2:19:20.680]  He's delivered on jobs, delivered on the border, delivered on three trillion in the stock market
[2:19:20.680 --> 2:19:25.880]  and all these great things. And then his enemies come out and say this and do this. And I know you
[2:19:25.880 --> 2:19:30.280]  don't want to get into it and talk about it, but I read your book in full. I only read two
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:35.000]  chapters. I got it the day before you came on a month ago. Trump's war against the deep state,
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:39.400]  you called it. I mean, it's true. You said it'll be them trying to start a war,
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:44.120]  them trying to block him. That'll be his greatest test. That's the last chapter in your book,
[2:19:44.120 --> 2:19:49.320]  Trump's war that everybody should read. Shame on the left, because if the left was really, you know,
[2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:53.320]  cared, they're criticizing you and I, I don't know if you know this, I'm seeing in last night
[2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:59.480]  today, actually attacking us that we don't want a war and saying we're a bunch of un-American crap.
[2:20:01.560 --> 2:20:06.200]  Well, let me say this to you. I have a chapter called Trump's war against the war machine in
[2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:14.200]  Trump's war. And I call him not a man of war. And I described the liberal war mongers, the neocons,
[2:20:14.200 --> 2:20:18.760]  the war profiteers, and I give a battle plan. I was afraid this day might come.
[2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:25.080]  But it takes a strong man to make peace and a weak man to make war. It is not a mark of strength
[2:20:25.560 --> 2:20:31.000]  to go to war, especially when our military is depleted. Now, let's look at that. We all know
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:37.160]  the military is depleted. The president knows that. And now what, with threatening China and Russia
[2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:45.160]  and North Korea at once, when half our planes on aircraft carriers are inoperable, what in the
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:52.600]  hell is going on here? Who is leading here? Who is making these decisions? I want to say something
[2:20:52.600 --> 2:20:59.000]  on a strictly commercial level. My book, Trump's war became number one on the New York Times best
[2:20:59.000 --> 2:21:05.880]  cell list, Alex, with zero appearance on Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. Never mind all of the other
[2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:10.680]  channels. That shows the decline of their power. Not only the decline of their power, Alex, I went
[2:21:10.680 --> 2:21:18.600]  on your show, drudge linked it. That was all I needed. Why? I don't need a new car. I'm not
[2:21:18.600 --> 2:21:23.240]  looking to buy a new car. I'm looking to save the nation. You want to change the world. You
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:26.760]  want, you love your children just like I do. It fundamentally pisses you off. Exactly. And what
[2:21:26.760 --> 2:21:30.840]  does that tell you? I go on Fox. They still have me on a few times. They wanted me to do a show
[2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:35.640]  and stuff. No response. I go on your show. You play a clip of my show. You have Paul Watson
[2:21:35.640 --> 2:21:40.040]  and on. We get millions of people visiting the site. I know you get that with us because we're
[2:21:40.040 --> 2:21:45.000]  the real median. Here's the problem, Dr. Savage. Google has banned us off Google ads. David Brock
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:48.600]  is bragging that they've got only people boycotting all our sponsors. We've lost almost all of them.
[2:21:48.600 --> 2:21:52.120]  We'd say, God, we sell our own products and I'm not bitching the audience, but here's the deal.
[2:21:52.120 --> 2:21:57.160]  Just like your book on China got banned from distribution, we are under attack. Do folks
[2:21:57.160 --> 2:22:02.280]  know that we have the big audience? We're fighting and the listeners need to know we're not the
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:08.680]  types to whine, but my God, are we getting censored? Alex again, talking commercially because a lot of
[2:22:08.680 --> 2:22:14.360]  people listening who don't know these things. The ratings just came out in streaming radio shows.
[2:22:14.360 --> 2:22:20.920]  My show is number one in the country, beating the great Rush Limbaugh by a huge number.
[2:22:20.920 --> 2:22:26.120]  On a bunch of platforms. Rush Limbaugh. Let's talk about him for a minute. How in the world
[2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:32.680]  does this man not understand what he sounds like? It's very sad. Well, I tuned into the day and I
[2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:36.040]  thought he was saying he was against it. Then he said, oh, I'm playing devil's advocate. Then he
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:40.120]  did an hour for it. And I just, I just, I don't want to see him. Go ahead and say.
[2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:44.920]  Let's not even talk about him. It's sad to watch a clown like that fall off the high wire.
[2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:49.720]  Alex, what are we going to do to get our message across to Donald Trump? Does he even care what
[2:22:49.720 --> 2:22:54.520]  we have to say? Let me tell you, he listens. The problem is. Well, why don't we ask him if you
[2:22:54.520 --> 2:23:00.840]  have access? I don't. I live out in Nowhereville, way on the West Coast. No one cares what I think.
[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:05.880]  I guarantee you, if I tell Trump you want to meet him in Mar-a-Lago next weekend,
[2:23:06.760 --> 2:23:09.640]  quite frankly, I was with a family trip in Hawaii. I don't want to get the media
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:13.240]  goes crazy with this. I'm not going to get into it, but let's just say I could have gone. I just,
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:19.080]  I just literally was family and I just, I couldn't do it. But believe me, sir, he absolutely loves you
[2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:23.080]  and you know that you already had dinner with him. If you want to go visit Trump,
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:26.840]  I mean, you can snap your fingers. I'll make a phone call and it'll happen.
[2:23:26.840 --> 2:23:31.400]  Well, I don't want to snap fingers. I would. I don't mean that arrogantly. I'm just saying he'd
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:35.720]  love to meet with you. I would love to visit him, not in Mar-a-Lago, but in the White House. That's
[2:23:35.720 --> 2:23:40.840]  what I would like to do. And I would fly across the country. I'm getting over the flu right now.
[2:23:40.840 --> 2:23:46.120]  I fought it off with my own nutrients, by the way. I haven't had the opportunity of taking yours.
[2:23:46.120 --> 2:23:49.160]  I'll tell you the truth. I could use some of that selenium right now. Pretty depleted.
[2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:54.440]  I think you like it depleted, depleted uranium. You're working hard at 75.
[2:23:54.440 --> 2:24:02.440]  Depleted uranium, Shell, Alex. Look, people think this is a joke and they think we do this just
[2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:07.960]  for effect. Yellows. For books, Alex. I know listening to your show that your heart's in it
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:13.560]  and anyone listening to me knows that my heart is in this. I don't know how to rescue the president
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:20.680]  from his, from his advisor. Something went wrong and it happened last week. There must be some way
[2:24:20.680 --> 2:24:28.600]  to sit down with him and say, please, Mr. President, please, in your vast array of people who you
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:34.040]  listen to, please listen to those who help make you what you are. We're not wrong. We're not crazy.
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:38.280]  We're not against you. Why are you listening to the never-trumpers that we're pretending there
[2:24:38.280 --> 2:24:44.280]  for you now? They're leading you into a blind out of which you'll never return. And that's key.
[2:24:44.280 --> 2:24:48.920]  We're not asking for anything but freedom and not having war and lower taxes. We're not the
[2:24:48.920 --> 2:24:53.080]  sick of fans that tried to destroy him, that he's tried to co-opt by giving power and instead
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:56.920]  they're beginning to co-opt him. In fact, that's a key point, Dr. Savage, for we, in this segment
[2:24:56.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  I know you've got to go, is that he's just surrounded. They have all this national security stuff.
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:07.480]  They took his phone away. They did all this other stuff I'm not liberty to get into. And he is
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:11.640]  going to take his phone away. They took his cell phone away claiming it would be a violation national
[2:25:11.640 --> 2:25:15.640]  security. And I don't know why he let him do it because that's what he used to call me on.
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:19.960]  Now he calls people up. Priebus is on the phone. When Trump calls you now, Priebus goes,
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:24.920]  this is Renz Priebus. Alex, will you talk to Trump? Or Roger, it's Priebus. Will you talk? And then
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:29.320]  they sit there on the phone because he's the president. So sir, we have to do this to make
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:34.040]  sure Russians aren't doing it. And they even tried to keep me from the inauguration telling Trump
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:39.640]  he's a Russian. They bully him with this. So I think he struck Syria so they stopped saying the
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:45.240]  Russia thing. I can't go into what he did, but there's always a way out of something you do
[2:25:45.240 --> 2:25:50.600]  once you realize that it's not required to go down the road a hundred percent. In other words,
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:55.320]  let's say it's done. What's done is done. But God's sake, stop beating the war drums. There are
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:01.080]  consequences to it. What I'm afraid of is, Alex, I could go on for another hour, which I will do
[2:26:01.080 --> 2:26:06.040]  when I'm on my own show. But World War II is very telling. We all hear that Japan attacked
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:11.000]  Pearl Harbor precipitously and without warning that it was a sneak attack.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:17.160]  People don't know the prelude to that. Japan had been starved for natural resources. Cutting off
[2:26:17.160 --> 2:26:22.920]  the oil. Cut off their oil. Pushed them up against the war. They had been our ally before that.
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:27.960]  Now what do we want to do now? Turn Russia into our greatest enemy once we hit them with
[2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:33.560]  more sanctions and cut off their revenue supply, revenue source from oil. When they're reforming.
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:38.840]  Well, what do you think Russia is going to do for God's sakes? That's why the left is
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:42.520]  so angry. They're now a Christian nation. I hate it. In closing, since you said it,
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:46.360]  you're an astute guy. Obviously, Michael Savage, Dr. Michael Savage, MichaelSavage.com,
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:49.800]  joining us. Let me ask you this question. What is it that happened last week?
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:54.920]  I know his daughter and others did come and put pressure on him. They said, you know, you've got
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.560]  to do this to show you're strong. I think Tillerson and others have kind of backed off the day off
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:03.480]  war drums. I think what you're saying and others are saying is having an effect. But what do you
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:07.960]  think it was happened a week ago, Dr. Savage? Oh, goodness, you're asking me. I don't know.
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:13.880]  I wasn't there. The president is a goodhearted man. That's the problem. I'm a softhearted man
[2:27:13.880 --> 2:27:18.520]  and a goodhearted man. So you show me a picture of two babies or three babies who were dead.
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:23.480]  Of course, I'm going to have compassion for them. But now you're connected to someone who didn't do
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:30.040]  it. You might hit the wrong target. So before we act again, for God's sakes, let's look at
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:35.160]  the pictures all over again. Who did it? We don't know who done it. You know, I was the first one
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:41.640]  in the media to say it didn't look like Sarangas. I do have a PhD, by the way, partly in epidemiology
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:46.360]  form, one of the great universities. A real doctorate. I'm the only one in the radio business
[2:27:46.360 --> 2:27:50.360]  who has any background in science. That's right. Speak to that. I don't have degrees like you do
[2:27:50.360 --> 2:27:54.920]  in medical degrees, but you're right. I mean, it does come in handy when you're dealing with
[2:27:54.920 --> 2:27:59.000]  science and literates in the media. We don't even put two or two together. I was the first one to
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:04.200]  say, for God's sakes, wait a minute, all of these people, the first responders are there without
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:10.040]  gloves, some of them in sandals, and it's supposed to be a Sarangas attack. They would be dead within
[2:28:10.040 --> 2:28:16.120]  minutes. That's number one. Number two, it didn't look like it was Sarangas. It did not look like
[2:28:16.120 --> 2:28:21.000]  a nerve agent. It looked like a chlorine-based agent, which doesn't make it any less ugly,
[2:28:21.720 --> 2:28:27.800]  but that means the whole story is alive. From top to bottom, one last point, and I know we both
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:35.080]  have to go. On my show today, I have both Pat Buchanan, who is brilliant, agrees with us. I also
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:45.160]  have another man who agrees with us, who was one of the chief, his name is Lawrence Wilkerson.
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:50.440]  No one ever heard of him. He was part of the United States Army Colonel, but he was chief
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:58.520]  of staff to Colin Powell during the 2003 false flag invasion of Iraq. The fake anthrax reports.
[2:28:58.520 --> 2:29:04.600]  Thank you. Wilkerson says this is another repeat of Iraq all over again. The same exact story.
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:09.080]  Oh, Michael, we got 30 seconds left, but they already have ground troops on the ground in Syria.
[2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:12.920]  The media then says that's a conspiracy theory, even though a month ago they admitted marines,
[2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:17.480]  artillery, army. This is crazy. In 20 seconds, closing comment, Michael Savage.
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:25.400]  I pray for Donald Trump. He's our only chance. It's why we all work so hard for him. I pray to
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:30.600]  God he understands that we're all fighting the same war as he is, but his greatest war right now
[2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:36.440]  is a war for the truth. And I hope to God if he hears this message, Alex, he will listen to Alex
[2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:42.280]  Jones and Michael Savage to stop the war before it gets worse. He is doing your live in 30 minutes
[2:29:42.280 --> 2:29:46.200]  at michaelsavage.com and stations across the country. Michael, let me say bye to you in the
[2:29:46.200 --> 2:29:49.240]  break. I know you have the flu. Thank you for the explosive. We'll be back with calls straight
[2:29:49.240 --> 2:29:57.400]  ahead. Stay with us. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.640 --> 2:30:09.320]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says the Syria chemical attack was a false flag and more
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:16.600]  are on the way. We have information from various sources that a similar provocation and I can't
[2:30:16.600 --> 2:30:21.640]  call it anything other than a provocation is being prepared in other parts of Syria, including the
[2:30:21.640 --> 2:30:28.840]  southern suburbs of Damascus, where they're again prepared to release some similar chemical substances
[2:30:28.840 --> 2:30:34.200]  and accuse the Syrian authorities of using them. Putin went on to compare the situation in Syria
[2:30:34.200 --> 2:30:41.000]  to Saddam Hussein's non-existent weapons of mass destruction, which may indicate that he believes
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:47.240]  the U.S. is either behind the false flag or actively pushing the propaganda. Meanwhile,
[2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:53.080]  the Russian government says Syrian forces possess no chemical weapons and any further
[2:30:53.080 --> 2:30:59.320]  attacks in Syria by the United States will be unacceptable. And you can learn more right now

[2:33:14.520 --> 2:33:25.240]  you are the resistance, you're listening to Alex Jones. Is this some conspiracy? Who's the
[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:44.920]  fad for no sin? Where is the pathetic evil warmongering left? As myself, Michael Savage and others,
[2:33:45.720 --> 2:33:51.320]  Ron Paul, Drudge Report to a certain extent, try to stop World War Three. Not because we're heroes,
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:56.920]  we like our kids out in the future. And you sit there and you call us warmongers, you call us
[2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:07.640]  racist, all this made up crap. They call me anti-Semitic in the forward. And all these other
[2:34:07.640 --> 2:34:14.520]  big Jewish publications, whenever I talk about George Soros being a Nazi collaborator,
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:20.200]  what's crazy is they even show clips of what I say in the article, like I did something wrong.
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:25.960]  It's not against George Soros, it's because I'm not against Israel. It's like they think they have
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:31.080]  authority because of the New York Times, the Washington Post or the forward or Vanity Fair
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:37.080]  because they're mainstream media, that if they just say it, it is. I learned a long time ago
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:40.360]  with bullies, they'd sit there and punch me in the face and think I was gonna fall over.
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:43.640]  Well, I didn't fall over. Like you didn't fall over. I was like, no, and now you're gonna fall over.
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:52.120]  Truth is, I wish well on everybody, whether they're in Israel or Iran or Japan or Venezuela.
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:34:58.200]  When I see somebody falling down and somebody not doing well, I don't feel good.
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:04.920]  And I have a soft side that tends to get me then to sell out my own personal freedom,
[2:35:04.920 --> 2:35:09.960]  try to save somebody. But you learn you can't save a drowning person if they're trying to
[2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:15.240]  claw you under and push you down. I was a little kid, we had a German shepherd,
[2:35:15.240 --> 2:35:17.960]  he was a great dog named Nunk, got hit by a car and I was a little kid.
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:22.120]  But you couldn't take that dog to the lake.
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:31.960]  In fact, you couldn't take him to a friend's house with a swimming pool because the dog was
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:36.600]  in the house, he'd bust down the screen door to get to you and would claw you thinking you were
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:41.160]  drowning. Kind of the reverse of someone trying to push you under when you save them, it was the
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:47.160]  other way around. And look, none of us are perfect, none of us have all the answers, but I just want
[2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:56.440]  prosperity and to see a future for humanity. And I see CNN going, oh, look at the alt-rights all
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:36:03.480]  upset, Trump's starting all these wars. How dare you not be for wars? And I'm just like, you people
[2:36:03.480 --> 2:36:11.560]  have no soul, you're corporate shills. Fox News is like the World War Three channel right now.
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:19.320]  At least China and North Korea have threatened people. Syria didn't start this war, didn't do
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:24.280]  jack diddly squat, except be a place where Jews, Christians and all sex of Muslims could live in
[2:36:24.280 --> 2:36:31.000]  peace and women went to college and could be doctors and I talked to all the ambassadors and
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:38.520]  CIA people that have been there. They tell me after Jordan, it's the best place in the Middle
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:45.400]  East other than Israel, we're having some basic freedom. People want to bash Israel all day,
[2:36:45.400 --> 2:36:56.040]  so I just weigh Israel like I weigh other countries and I go, okay, Israel is just tiny piece of land
[2:36:56.040 --> 2:37:02.600]  and then Saudi Arabia has more wealth than any other country probably for their elite, not per
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:07.000]  capital wealth, for their elite per capital wealth to be like South Korea, overall wealth to be
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:12.840]  something like Switzerland, United States after that. But for wealth of elites, I mean Saudi Arabia's,
[2:37:13.400 --> 2:37:19.560]  they are like 30,000 princes or something. I'm going to your calls in a moment.
[2:37:19.560 --> 2:37:24.360]  And the average one is like $5 million a year, the big ones get billions a year.
[2:37:25.880 --> 2:37:29.960]  Hundreds of princes get billions a year. Oh, you're a prince, here's billions of dollars.
[2:37:30.520 --> 2:37:34.600]  They've got whole cities for whatever reason, we don't know that are air conditioned.
[2:37:38.280 --> 2:37:42.520]  Big plastic tents that are like three bedroom houses that can house millions of people
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:48.280]  and they don't take one refugee and then they sit there and they lecture Israel how they should
[2:37:48.280 --> 2:37:52.360]  take quote Palestinians and that just means Arabs getting out of their countries and going to Israel.
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:38:01.400]  It's not that I'm even against Israel or for Israel. I don't say that like I'm on some fence.
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:06.040]  I get to see the Jewish newspapers in Israel attack me all day and make cramp up
[2:38:07.160 --> 2:38:11.320]  because I'm not anti-Israel like George Soros. I mean, I get it. I can't be allowed to have any
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:22.040]  credibility. I'm not George Soros. I mean, I understand. I just know Israel is running the
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:27.800]  world, the globalists around the world. I just get so sick of the pseudo-intellectual sitting back
[2:38:27.800 --> 2:38:33.800]  going, hey Alex, tell us how Israel runs your life or the Vatican or Lutela runs my life. My conscience
[2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:40.360]  runs my life. My conscience is so strong that even though some things probably aren't good for my
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:47.080]  family, I do the right thing no matter what's going on. And that's not because I'm some wonderful
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:53.000]  person. I've got an operating system that I'm not a dirtbag psychopath. When I do things that aren't
[2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:58.040]  perfectly right, but I want to do because of the flesh, I'm guilty for that.
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:07.000]  I don't want to talk about myself all day, but you know, when you're being attacked in 100 plus
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:13.720]  newspapers a day, every day, sometimes 1,000 newspapers, sometimes 5,000, sometimes every
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:20.520]  paper in the country they're so controlled and every major NBC, ABC, CBS, NBC affiliate will
[2:39:20.520 --> 2:39:26.440]  attack me and lie about me and I've got to sit there and I got to take it and I got to take
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:30.920]  weak-minded people on the street that don't know that's a lie and I got to sit there and watch
[2:39:30.920 --> 2:39:37.800]  them disdain me and hate me and it doesn't hurt me when they're hating me because of my ego. It
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:44.920]  hurts me because they're deceived and I think about what it'd be like to be them because they're
[2:39:44.920 --> 2:39:57.880]  slaves. You know how I get over it? Austin, Texas is a big side of homeless people because the city
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:02.680]  doesn't run them off and they've gotten rid of the mental institutions the last 20, 30 years so
[2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:08.840]  there's schizophrenics and people all over the streets and almost every major four-way stop
[2:40:08.840 --> 2:40:14.360]  in downtown Austin but way out 20 miles outside the city has got schizophrenics begging for money
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:18.760]  and they're so whacked out of their brain half the time they're not even asking for money.
[2:40:19.880 --> 2:40:23.640]  I don't give money to the con artists that are out there but I see somebody missing their legs
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:28.920]  or whatever a diabetic I give them some money but I see those schizophrenics they're having
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:32.040]  arguments with themselves they're talking to them they're talking to the wind
[2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:46.120]  and I realize here I am conscious aware of geopolitical systems tied into things no probably
[2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:49.960]  nobody else is very few let's just put it to you that way not on a power trip to say that
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:55.800]  but because I followed this path this far down and then every now at deeper I go
[2:40:56.760 --> 2:41:02.200]  the connections the discernment the trust I have with people only intensifies
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:12.360]  now look at the public and they're like mentally ill schizophrenics talk to themselves
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:15.720]  somebody makes fun of me in a restaurant or comes over and knocks my drink over with my family
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:19.800]  or somebody slaps me in the back of the head and I'm at the beach with my kids
[2:41:20.440 --> 2:41:23.080]  says hey racist beat your ass you drunk sport
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:31.000]  I cannot get up now and take them down because I realize they're a victim
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:37.400]  and I don't take any pleasure in that but I'll tell you this
[2:41:40.360 --> 2:41:43.000]  before we go to Dominique and everybody else has been holding like patriots
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:50.600]  I realize something that is fundamental our species of this planet and this great experiment
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:42:00.360]  we're part of if the species is destroyed through war genetic engineering natural disaster
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:07.240]  everything our species did before us everything our ancestors did to survive is destroyed and
[2:42:07.240 --> 2:42:14.920]  so for me we're in a long-term war for humanity to escape the planet
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:20.920]  planet's beautiful I love it just like I love my mommy when I was six years old
[2:42:22.360 --> 2:42:26.520]  when I was about six years old she kicked me off her lap and said like you can't be a mama's boy
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:29.320]  now you don't get any more love because you're gonna be a man
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:35.560]  and that's what it comes down to
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:42.600]  we're gonna leave this planet we're meant to
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:54.920]  and our destiny is right there in our hands right now the whole future unlimited humans
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:43:02.280]  cannot even imagine what is in store for us our our progeny will look back and we're successful on us
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:11.000]  as the heroes that laid the cornerstone for everything we do after this that is unlimited
[2:43:12.040 --> 2:43:13.720]  we have to escape this test
[2:43:16.760 --> 2:43:18.040]  if we destroy ourselves
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:21.960]  there'll be other tests
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:29.160]  the people like Leslie Lindsey Graham people like
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:38.680]  John McCain they want temporal power now they want control they want to show the planet they're in
[2:43:38.680 --> 2:43:45.560]  charge instead of chivalry and honor and building something true not because others won't stab you in
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:50.360]  the back but because you're going to trailblaze the path the path to the future
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:59.160]  you look at China you look at North Korea you look at the things that are happening
[2:43:59.160 --> 2:44:02.280]  and you can see how much danger this planet is in
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:17.880]  that's why i get guilty when i get angry or say things tongue in cheek or my dog dies
[2:44:18.840 --> 2:44:24.840]  my dog had just died the night before blood pouring out his nose and mouth
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:29.400]  my complaining i'm telling the story my dog had just died the night before i've been up all night
[2:44:29.400 --> 2:44:32.920]  long buried in the next day at my parents they were on vacation it was their dog that used to be
[2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:37.720]  my dog staying with me blood was pouring out he was dying he chased the cat around for hours playing
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:41.160]  that heart attack died aneurysm whatever it was blood was coming out
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:48.360]  and i shouldn't have gone to work that day and i shouldn't have been up that night the
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:53.000]  tighter i am the more i work at like 11 o'clock at night saying you call me a russian agent i'll
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:58.040]  punch you in the nose and all this stuff that was me just sad about my dog just the truth is
[2:44:58.040 --> 2:45:00.600]  somebody calling me stuff i'm not that didn't really make me that mad
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:10.200]  but the reason i get it all this is that
[2:45:14.840 --> 2:45:20.280]  there's a very good chance we're going to destroy ourselves there's a very good chance we're going
[2:45:20.280 --> 2:45:23.640]  to have a nuclear winter and that six billion people are going to die
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:31.720]  and i guess the meek in the south pacific if the war isn't too intense might live
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:36.440]  they'll have radiation poisoning deformities but they're going to survive so i guess the
[2:45:36.440 --> 2:45:40.120]  meek will her at the earth and i guess like the bible says you know two-thirds of the planet will
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:51.400]  be killed and i'm just a little guilty that i don't have a strong enough flesh to convince my family
[2:45:51.400 --> 2:46:01.080]  to leave but here i am just a normal guy believes in humanity a throwback trying to stop nuclear war
[2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:07.560]  like michael savage because we like going to restaurants we know we like going out on boats
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:11.720]  in the water and we like seeing our kids and we like having friends and we just we don't want
[2:46:11.720 --> 2:46:22.200]  to kill the russians we don't want to kill the chinese we don't want anything
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:23.880]  and then we look at those that are seeking power
[2:46:28.040 --> 2:46:38.200]  who never even had power they're like functionaries and a big blind beast a corporate hungry
[2:46:38.200 --> 2:46:46.200]  seeking creature directed by millions of souls that are unconscious just looking for salvation
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:54.040]  and believing if they dive down some rat hole into hell they might find absolution and nirvana
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:47:03.720]  or valhalla and all they'll find is a twilight of the gods which is the end of humanity
[2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:10.920]  i'm gonna go to your phone calls i'm gonna make this very brief if you want to see us grow in
[2:47:10.920 --> 2:47:16.760]  the face of enemy attacks i mean there we are you know on the stage in the arena under attack
[2:47:16.760 --> 2:47:23.480]  water filtration systems 40 percent off we've never done that uh x2 super good halogen out there

[2:47:54.040 --> 2:48:00.760]  call i just want to say the niece and i had nine thanks for that sale and and then also the bubble
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:06.120]  gum the bubble gum toothpaste i can't believe them both of my kids absolutely love it and we're
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:13.720]  going to definitely become consistent customers with that right now i believe that we're at a fork
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:19.480]  in the road with with president trump and um and you know he's done a lot of great things like you've
[2:48:19.480 --> 2:48:25.320]  said uh the the best thing that i've seen i've seen him do is you know the takedown of the
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:31.480]  the petal gate and we we need to stay on that topic that that's uh that's an amazing thing about
[2:48:31.480 --> 2:48:37.560]  trump he won't brag about military operations petal gate anything he does uh he'll say silly
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:41.480]  things like oh what a great crowd what a great ratings but he won't he really is that's the
[2:48:41.480 --> 2:48:46.200]  paradox what do you say about that he's doing so good domestically so good on our jobs that i
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:52.760]  can't believe he's done so good and then on the other side now this war i mean i just what do you
[2:48:52.760 --> 2:48:59.800]  think that's that's what that's what's strange is that he's doing so many great things domestically
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:05.480]  but i think that if he continues with this war if he if he continues and then puts troops on the
[2:49:05.480 --> 2:49:11.960]  ground and and and then starts an actual war with them where there's more syrian lives lost
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:19.320]  you know our uh mutual enemy is isis and al-qaeda in that area so we should be we should be helping
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:24.200]  that's right syria didn't start the war saudi arabia did i'll be i'm not a warmonger but if
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:29.240]  trump i woke up he'd launch strikes on riyadh taking out the royals i was i mean i would just
[2:49:29.240 --> 2:49:33.560]  be like you know what it's the right thing to do we shouldn't be doing it but i mean i want to i mean
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:37.320]  but no we're going to take out the regime that's tolerant that didn't start a war
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:43.320]  yeah they're you know they're they're they protect christians over there one of the only
[2:49:43.320 --> 2:49:48.040]  countries in the middle east muslim countries in the middle east i do that and you know why
[2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:53.080]  they're crypto christians more than half they're crypto christians bro that's why the elite want
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:57.640]  to go on they're crypto christians they all secretly operate churches asad's a christian
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:50:03.560]  that's why they hate him it's ridiculous but you know i was thinking we were talking last night
[2:50:03.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  with a friend of mine online and he was uh he said you know oh i think that trump's being blackmailed
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:14.440]  and i said yeah but he was talking about some kind of you know prostitution thing i said come on man

[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:53.480]  all about exposure he has a hundred days from the day of the inauguration well he's only got
[3:02:53.480 --> 3:02:57.960]  the that's like 18 days left man let me say this he's being blockaded at every level of government
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:03:03.480]  we've had triple or more of the arrest i mean he is going after him he is delivering domestically
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:07.480]  i mean i'll tell you he wasn't i mean it's it's happening so he's just blocked he they can't even
[3:03:07.480 --> 3:03:12.040]  get them to drop charges against our pio so well you know let's see he's not samson here he's not

[3:03:16.920 --> 3:03:23.640]  us god bless you uh let's go ahead and talk to uh hawns hawns and pennsylvania then jason
[3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:32.760]  and germany go ahead hawns yes good afternoon um as far as uh nepotism is concerned in politics
[3:03:32.760 --> 3:03:38.040]  it's never a good idea and i think the president needs to send his kids back to trump towers
[3:03:39.480 --> 3:03:45.080]  and also i was thinking about his 180 degree reversal on policy when he attacked syria
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:50.520]  and i have to ask myself it may be uh the people that are surrounding him aren't conducting some
[3:03:50.520 --> 3:03:55.800]  sort of a psychological operation against him and softening him up so that he's more susceptible
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:04:00.200]  to their influence oh they admit they've got his daughter everybody and they're all weak-minded
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:05.080]  you know let's just face it i mean if you haven't been in politics for i mean i i see myself as
[3:04:05.080 --> 3:04:09.480]  weak-minded imagine they're super weak-minded they haven't been doing this for decades they're
[3:04:09.480 --> 3:04:15.000]  not used to it i'm thinking in terms of sleep deprivation and maybe putting something in this
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:19.960]  this coffee and maybe you know they drug you know they drug they did it to reagan they drug reagan
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:26.600]  yeah and they can pipe in uh this subliminal stuff while he's asleep in his bedroom up there too i
[3:04:26.600 --> 3:04:30.600]  mean they can soften him up well that's why he's smart that's why he doesn't stay in the winehouse
[3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:33.320]  and i'm not going to give away anything but believe me trump knows what's going on
[3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:39.800]  to try and get his phone back to obama had his blackberry for eight years and nobody took it away
[3:04:39.800 --> 3:04:44.600]  from him hey i know the president's number because i've been called on it many times that's when we
[3:04:44.600 --> 3:04:48.760]  got that nsa league i saw like well that's his number well that's his marlago apartment

[3:05:31.080 --> 3:05:37.800]  putin went on to compare the situation in syria to sedam hussein's non-existent weapons of mass
[3:05:37.800 --> 3:05:44.760]  destruction which may indicate that he believes the us is either behind the false flag or actively
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:51.160]  pushing the propaganda meanwhile the russian government says syrian forces possess no chemical

[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:57.720]  trumps doing all the things that the globalists don't want he's hitting all the right buttons
[3:08:57.720 --> 3:09:02.680]  he's done everything on the economy everything on sovereignty free speech that's why i'm giving
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:06.920]  the benefit of the doubt on syria but this north korea situation i want to go to paul watson right
[3:09:06.920 --> 3:09:09.960]  now i promised that a few more calls we'll take them together right now and then let
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:15.480]  paul take over it got it's hard to get on air anyways paul i've totally backed you and your
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:20.840]  criticism of trump i agree with you but you know i called you sunday and i told you what the president
[3:09:20.840 --> 3:09:27.160]  had said and i you noticed now tillerson has all said that and they've reiterated it there's there's
[3:09:27.160 --> 3:09:32.520]  a real war going on here that the president's not putting out multi versions he's being ignored
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:37.720]  he has a rebellion against him where he can't hire anybody that'll actually carry out his will
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:44.920]  what do you make of this paul watson it's in a snapshot of where we are historically
[3:09:46.920 --> 3:09:52.920]  well i mean it's strange times alex i mean sean spicer just went out and said that hitler
[3:09:52.920 --> 3:09:59.240]  never gasped anybody very strange statements what the hell is that from sean spicer
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:04.280]  yeah it just happened half an hour ago pulling up was he being sarcastic
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:11.080]  no he said hit he was comparing hitler with a sad and he said even hitler didn't stoop to this level
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:15.240]  hitler never gasped i think he meant like didn't drop gas on people they'd use chemical weapons
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:21.880]  in world war two yeah but he didn't anyway he's getting attacked over that strange statement
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:27.320]  but the uh chilling thing for me i like it shows how historically ignorant his crew is
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:32.120]  it was like what schwarzenegger said i want to shove carbon monoxide
[3:10:32.120 --> 3:10:35.960]  tubes everybody that doesn't agree on carbon taxes and kill them it's like dude your dad was a famous
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:42.440]  nazi he just they just don't have any historical sorry go ahead hey guys i'm chiming in real quick
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:47.320]  um aside from that sean spicer thing about gassing hitler gassing people uh it's really
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:52.920]  interesting that the mainstream media has been pushing this parallel of auschwitz uh they push
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:57.880]  it with against rand all this Lindsey Lindsey Graham is saying that that he denies auschwitz
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:02.680]  happened when auschwitz obviously was a death cam a forced labor camp and death cam and then we also
[3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:12.360]  have um them coming out saying syria is like japan isis is like hitler so that's a great point matt
[3:11:12.360 --> 3:11:19.160]  paul yeah things are getting crazy alex i've got a guest coming on at 33 after who you know
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:24.600]  his sources closer to trump administration told him syria would be struck it was struck within
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:29.720]  hours now that same source is telling him it's 50 likely they're going to attack north korea
[3:11:30.440 --> 3:11:36.680]  imminently basically so we're going to get into that china has now come out and said that they will
[3:11:36.680 --> 3:11:44.040]  attack north korea's nuclear facilities if it crosses a red line so now china is basically
[3:11:44.040 --> 3:11:48.360]  betraying its own ally saying that they will create a red line let me stop you that's because
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:53.480]  trump told him he's ready to go to war and he's serious here's roiders they turned back uh north
[3:11:53.480 --> 3:12:00.280]  korea's main export is coal and slave labor to china they turned back four ships five ships that had
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:04.840]  coal on them going back so it looks like china actually bought into what trump was saying it looks
[3:12:04.840 --> 3:12:09.720]  like trump's breakmanship is working let's talk about your source that's huge paul uh your source
[3:12:09.720 --> 3:12:15.400]  has been accurate who was this source uh saying this what happened and now it's happened well it's
[3:12:15.400 --> 3:12:21.080]  jack posibiek who is coming on at 33 after and like i said you know he was told 75 percent
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:26.600]  certainty they would strike syria hours before when nobody expected it it happened same sources
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:30.920]  telling him they're going to go into north korea imminently so we're going to get into it he's
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:35.880]  got the source i'll be clear i mean i'm not knocking him and he's a good guy i know he is
[3:12:36.600 --> 3:12:39.960]  we said hours before they probably hit it right with the chinese president met i mean
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:45.240]  he had signaled that the you're the expert on the source this source way before said this was
[3:12:45.240 --> 3:12:51.080]  going to happen now this this just came out today with the north korea issue so you know
[3:12:51.080 --> 3:12:55.240]  i'm going to get into it at 33 after well let's talk about that because trump says he's prepared
[3:12:55.240 --> 3:13:02.440]  the military to hit uh china seems to be i agree with your source uh i mean well i didn't see that
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:08.680]  where did china say they're ready to hit uh north korea it's uh headline china threatens to bomb
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:14.120]  north korea's nuclear facilities if it crosses beijing's bottom line so now they've got a bottom
[3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:18.360]  line they came out in their official global times which is like the communist mouthpiece is
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:23.560]  basically straight from the government and said i can quote it china has a bottom line
[3:13:23.560 --> 3:13:27.960]  that it will protect at all costs it goes on to say china will employ by all means available
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:33.240]  including the military means to strike back it's not an issue of discussion whether china acquiesces
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:39.720]  but the chinese people's liberation army will launch attacks against dp rk nuclear facilities
[3:13:39.720 --> 3:13:45.240]  on its own so that's so this shows trump literally throw that that's what i was told trump said look
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:49.400]  i'm ready to go they've got everybody in place well let's just point this out everybody says
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:53.720]  china runs north korea that's not the intel i get it sounds like north korea is out of control
[3:13:53.720 --> 3:13:59.400]  that's the way to do this let china strike north korea then well i mean it's interesting i
[3:13:59.400 --> 3:14:04.600]  i did a poll it's 50 50 amongst trump supporters trump voters whether they endorse an attack on
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:10.680]  north korea i mean at least you could say north korea is directly threatening the u s on a weekly
[3:14:10.680 --> 3:14:16.040]  basis if not more they're belligerent they're aggressive they're threatening a six and a
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:21.400]  nuclear test they're lobbing ballistic missiles into the sea of japan on an on an almost weekly
[3:14:21.400 --> 3:14:27.160]  basis now so you could at least make the argument i guess constitutionally that they represent a
[3:14:27.160 --> 3:14:32.200]  threat to the united states sure let me be clear do that if i'm pointing a gun at you and i say my
[3:14:32.200 --> 3:14:36.440]  fingers on the trigger i'm going to shoot you you have a right then to shoot me because i'm
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:41.320]  threatening to do it kim jong-un is ready for war as china moves 140 000 trips to support
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:46.040]  repert donald trumpson's warships north korea they're threatening north korea is to nuke the carrier
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:53.560]  task force they understand the united states has 20 to 1 superiority over china no exactly but of
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:15:00.040]  course the threat is the escalation as soon as the u.s attacks north korea they will lob missiles
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:04.760]  into south korea they will attack south korea and it could be the start of world war three
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:08.280]  that's why people are concerned about i don't think it could be i think of a shooting war
[3:15:08.280 --> 3:15:14.840]  starts nukes will be used now i agree and we need to have room for that debate the most concerning
[3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:21.080]  thing to me alex is a lot of trump supporters and not on info wars you probably notice this
[3:15:21.080 --> 3:15:26.120]  they're completely on our side in terms of being against a military escalation in syria
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:30.760]  against toppling is sad because it's proven completely disastrous every time we've done it in
[3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:36.760]  the past but then if you look at the polls for example 86 percent of republicans support the
[3:15:36.760 --> 3:15:44.280]  attack on syria 86 percent uh roughly the same number of democrat support as supported an attack
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:51.400]  on syria under obama back in 2013 but his actual approval rating hasn't moved it's basically stayed
[3:15:51.400 --> 3:15:57.240]  the same the general approval rating so well those numbers are saying was the approval ratings are
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:02.040]  totally fake but i totally agree with you this is a crisis here's the deal north korea is threatening
[3:16:02.040 --> 3:16:06.760]  to attack everybody china has been backing all this belligerence so they're the ones starting
[3:16:06.760 --> 3:16:12.360]  the fight that's why here i'm supporting the president being strong syria didn't start the
[3:16:12.360 --> 3:16:17.320]  war syria didn't do anything we're backing the wrong people in syria that's why i'm against it
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:22.680]  it's all moral standing paul yeah and we're just maintaining the principle that we've had for the
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:28.360]  six year long syrian civil war the other argument they've got i mean i'm concerned because i'm seeing
[3:16:28.360 --> 3:16:33.880]  a lot of trump supporters you know basically turning it into a cult of personality where they say
[3:16:33.880 --> 3:16:38.360]  i will support anything if trump says it's the right thing to do well they're gonna support him
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:45.080]  if he starts barbecuing babies on the white house lawn you know 400 000 syrian people both
[3:16:45.080 --> 3:16:50.440]  military and civilians have died in the six year war as sad didn't just suddenly start killing his
[3:16:50.440 --> 3:16:56.680]  own people it's the civil war the jihadists are killing their own people that's what it is so what
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:17:03.480]  changed from march 31 when rex tillerson said a saddest part of the future of syria to now we
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:09.000]  must have regime change in syria something changed because it wasn't the chemical weapons attack
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:13.160]  there've been attacks on both sides they've killed each other and that's what michael sabbage
[3:17:13.160 --> 3:17:17.640]  asked last hour i'm skipping this breaks we have more time why what do you think it is the change
[3:17:19.320 --> 3:17:23.400]  i think it was the demotion of bannon from the national security council and the fact that
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:28.600]  trumps being surrounded by neocons and you know i've gone on record opposing that i think it's a
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:35.240]  very concerning development and it's concerning that a lot of trump supporters start not our base
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:40.520]  not the info wars base alex if you go on info wars you read the comments these are high information
[3:17:40.520 --> 3:17:46.920]  readers but a lot of the low information trump voters will just go along with whatever he says
[3:17:46.920 --> 3:17:52.360]  not knowing that it's because he's he's come under pressure from the people who are surrounding him
[3:17:52.360 --> 3:17:59.480]  you know back on march 11th i said i went through his foreign policy advisors one by one you know
[3:17:59.480 --> 3:18:06.040]  25 30 of them half of them at least were cfr members back then it's like well yeah some of them
[3:18:06.040 --> 3:18:10.600]  absolutely it's the same people and what we care about is him getting policy done if he hires
[3:18:10.600 --> 3:18:15.400]  goblins investigate mordor that's fine just don't become mordo we don't want to catch them in bed
[3:18:15.400 --> 3:18:22.600]  with the goblin but but but looking at this if china is now threatening to attack north korea
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:28.040]  to stop them if china just turned back north korean coal their main funding it looks like
[3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:32.760]  trumps brinksmanship and mcmasters brinksmanship might actually be working again i'm not defending
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:38.840]  this type of brinksmanship but it looks like it might be working well i mean you know but we have
[3:18:38.840 --> 3:18:44.360]  the korean war which killed like 1.2 million people that's going to be child's play compared to a
[3:18:44.360 --> 3:18:49.960]  nuclear escalation in that part of the world you know 33 000 dead troops in the korean war
[3:18:49.960 --> 3:18:55.960]  but what risk are they putting the i agree i've got children i don't want this risk poll i'm just
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:01.560]  saying yeah preliminarily it looks like this brinksmanship in the korean peninsula is going
[3:19:01.560 --> 3:19:08.200]  the way of trump china is signaling all over the place that they're they are now doing the uss
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:15.880]  well we're going to have to wait and see we know that basically south koreans are panicking their
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:21.320]  government had to come out and quell their fears that there's going to be imminent war you have
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:26.440]  an expert we just got the article up on inform us a couple of hours ago he says that there's a plan
[3:19:26.440 --> 3:19:33.080]  to strike the north korean main nuclear reactor what will that lead to environmentally but there's
[3:19:33.080 --> 3:19:39.160]  i said earlier this this source has told jack possibly i'm going to get him on that it's 50
[3:19:39.160 --> 3:19:43.480]  percent likely that there's going to be an imminent strike on north korea well trump's already said
[3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:47.880]  that escalating quickly and they've already got everybody ready to they're also going to kill kim
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:52.840]  jong-un so he better be in a deep deep bunker right now because let me tell you they got the
[3:19:52.840 --> 3:19:57.480]  space space weapons trained on his ass uh what do you think overall about the situation paul
[3:19:57.480 --> 3:20:03.800]  i think there is more support amongst trump voters for an attack on north korea than there
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:08.840]  was syria because even amongst yeah because they're threatening everybody yeah well he's
[3:20:08.840 --> 3:20:13.960]  threatening everybody you can make the argument from that angle you know they've got 200 000 people
[3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:21.000]  in gulags political prisoners um this this is a dictator armed with nuclear weapons nobody
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:26.280]  can deny that i think it's very different to the situation in syria but more trump supporters
[3:20:26.280 --> 3:20:31.880]  support an attack on north korea than they did on syria that much is clear i think on syria
[3:20:32.520 --> 3:20:38.440]  um this paul said 86 percent support it 51 percent of americans overall support the trump
[3:20:38.440 --> 3:20:44.520]  strike on syria i think that would be higher in the case of north korea oh absolutely i mean i don't
[3:20:44.520 --> 3:20:48.920]  we didn't start this with north korea the clinton's gave them the reactors to create the weapons
[3:20:48.920 --> 3:20:53.560]  here's the deal paul uh nobody's behind that camera so i can do this is unloaded as well of course
[3:20:53.560 --> 3:21:00.440]  but i mean if i'm pointing a gun right at you okay like north korea threatening japan to nuke
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:06.440]  tokyo they're threatening uh to attack seoul south korea they say they have the missiles
[3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:11.000]  are shooting them every week they say they're going to nuke the u.s task force don't they understand
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:15.960]  that the united states japan everybody russia quite frankly is threatened to nuke china before
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:20.360]  they were doing this don't they understand that we have a right when they're threatening us
[3:21:20.360 --> 3:21:26.920]  and pointing right at us for us to pull the trigger preemptively to stop them paul well it
[3:21:26.920 --> 3:21:32.360]  it's a better argument for it can be made than what's happening in syria and you know on that
[3:21:32.360 --> 3:21:38.520]  subject putin came out today and said what we said an hour after the strike which is yeah they put
[3:21:38.520 --> 3:21:43.560]  not just that they could just stage a chemical weapons incident in demascus and if the new
[3:21:43.560 --> 3:21:49.880]  standard is now set that you know any atrocities met by a us missile strike an attack then that's
[3:21:49.880 --> 3:21:55.640]  by by Assad and it's the obliteration of demascus and syria and that's the point there's all this
[3:21:55.640 --> 3:21:59.720]  talk about oh we're going to have a political solution where Assad is going to politely step
[3:21:59.720 --> 3:22:06.200]  down no that's not going to happen he's fought a brutal civil war for six years he's being under
[3:22:06.200 --> 3:22:11.800]  intense international pressure for that six years to step down he's not going to do it without a
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:16.120]  fight so let me ask you this question right like convincing it's not going to happen let me ask you
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:20.440]  this question we're gonna go a few calls i'm turned over to you here but i promise go these calls
[3:22:20.440 --> 3:22:25.800]  gut level what do you think's happening with trump i think they said look north korea is
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:29.960]  threatening china threatening you've got to look strong we don't know whose chemicals these are
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:34.520]  send a message that's what i was told by the white house sources i know the president told folks that
[3:22:35.160 --> 3:22:40.120]  and now tell us and is backing off all this war talk with syria today i mean i think that's
[3:22:40.120 --> 3:22:47.240]  overall encouraging china cutting off commerce with north korea it looks like things are
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:51.640]  deescalating i mean every other talk show host wants to escalate all this right now i'm trying
[3:22:51.640 --> 3:22:58.200]  to deescalate but i'm being honest about all this so paul what is your gut tell you well i don't
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:02.600]  think we're going to know until a week or two's time you've got a lot of mixed messages you've
[3:23:02.600 --> 3:23:07.960]  got tillerson basically with a different message each each day it's like yes we have to take out
[3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:13.480]  isis first but eventually a sad has to go then he said oh the syrian people have to decide whether
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:18.200]  i said has to go or not so they can't get the script right then you've got nicky hailey at the
[3:23:18.200 --> 3:23:24.520]  un who is holding up photographs you know like colin powell held up the vial of anthrax or whatever
[3:23:24.520 --> 3:23:30.200]  or the baby that's proof of some better shit it just smells bad alex you turn on fox news it's like
[3:23:30.200 --> 3:23:34.760]  pre iraq war invasion kind of rhetoric oh i agree they're they're foaming at the mouth
[3:23:34.760 --> 3:23:40.280]  and these aren't muslims with no weapons were attacking this time this is major powers with
[3:23:40.280 --> 3:23:45.400]  nuclear weapons i promise to go to calls let's take a few then i'll let paul take over jason in
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:51.000]  dutchland uh you're on the air go ahead hey first of all i want to say it's a pleasure to be on
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:57.320]  what paul's on i love paul if all i'm on twitter uh just a note on the uh the opening that you came
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:24:02.920]  in with uh melania trump and lord's prayer i'm jack christian at best uh and i've never prayed for
[3:24:02.920 --> 3:24:08.680]  our leaders before until trump came in and uh i do pray for trump uh i don't know how how far my
[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:14.040]  prayers make it up to the mount stairs but i do do that couple couple pieces of advice for trump
[3:24:14.040 --> 3:24:18.520]  just practically speaking i don't know why nobody in the government has to you know
[3:24:18.520 --> 3:24:23.480]  tool up some factory to make their own phones why are we worried about android devices or blackbird
[3:24:23.480 --> 3:24:28.840]  devices when we could easily tool up a factory with the best experts in the world and create a
[3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:33.800]  fricking phone that that trump could feel secure on so that's one thing second thing i don't know
[3:24:33.800 --> 3:24:40.920]  why trump hasn't organized a parallel uh maybe secretive uh intelligence group that he can trust
[3:24:40.920 --> 3:24:45.960]  rather than relying only on the intel that he's getting from the deep state um as far as the
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:51.480]  north korea thing why am i feeling like this is the ghost of false flags past uh you know with
[3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:56.200]  with how we got into the vietnam or with the gulf of tonkin i agree and now there's all these
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:25:01.240]  nuclear weapons it just goes from from bad to worse uh matt in oklahoma you're on the air with
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:07.480]  paul joseph watson oh man what's going on alex and paul at the same time man what am i up man
[3:25:07.480 --> 3:25:13.000]  i'm glad i held as long as i did um i had three uh real quick things to touch on one you guys were
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:20.040]  segueing into first thing north korea um we all know kim he is crazy yes and he's got nukes okay
[3:25:20.600 --> 3:25:26.120]  nobody likes him but let's talk about why we want to actually attack the country for a moment
[3:25:26.120 --> 3:25:33.320]  uh that north korea and i ran and i believe cuba was the last three countries that did not get
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:38.840]  taken over by central banking system i.e. you know the federal reserve and and all of their lackeys
[3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:44.200]  and and and their their banking cartels if you will but uh you know this is the only real reason
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:48.680]  we want to go into north korea and we're being provocative to them so that they throw the first
[3:25:48.680 --> 3:25:53.800]  punch so we can just knock them out with the next swing but that let me just stop you the fact
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:59.400]  that yeah go ahead i mean the fact that for the first time ever china is threatening officially
[3:25:59.400 --> 3:26:05.000]  in their people's daily to nuke north korea and turning their ships back shows they were told
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:11.800]  we're ready to go to war we're crazy do what we say whatever trump said got the chinese dictators
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:17.720]  attention i gotta say this is crazy i've never seen the chinese roll over like this uh china
[3:26:17.720 --> 3:26:21.000]  threatened to bomb north korea's nuclear facilities it's also an enforce dot com we'll show that
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:25.720]  version if it crosses beijing's bottom line and that is starting a war with the united states so
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:32.040]  wow i gotta tell you trump's brinksmanship uh at least so far has has has really had an effect
[3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:35.800]  i'm gonna go back to you call her but paul watson what do you make of this
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:41.960]  well i mean what concerns me alex is if you take that position you're siding with
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:47.640]  john mccain lindsay grayham hillary clinton nancy polosi and a lot of them that makes me i'm not i'm
[3:26:47.640 --> 3:26:53.480]  not in syria but north korea has been asking for it i'm not saying i want war well if if you read
[3:26:53.480 --> 3:26:58.920]  um what the wall street journal wrote today which is quote some trump fans are unhappy with this
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:04.840]  drift towards the conventional meanwhile the off-derided establishment is breathing a bit easier
[3:27:04.840 --> 3:27:10.600]  so conventional to them is obliterating countries and toppling secular leaders and allowing jihadists
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:15.880]  to come in and you know hundreds of thousands of people dying that's conventional that pleases the
[3:27:15.880 --> 3:27:21.160]  establishment and the establishment is very pleased at developments over the past 10 days or so
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:28.520]  that's what worries me i hear you it's on screen right now we're gonna punch it up and put it up
[3:27:28.520 --> 3:27:34.040]  there for folks uh china threatens to bomb north korea's facilities if you scroll down that's in
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:38.360]  the people's daily they have a link there we'll uh scroll down and then link through the actual link
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:44.280]  in the story uh that is just wild right there to show where we've gotten to but i mean why does
[3:27:44.280 --> 3:27:48.040]  anybody care about north korea anyways i mean it's a bunch of poor slaves we've got to turn
[3:27:48.040 --> 3:27:51.720]  this around i i know this paul every night i go to bed and i wake up in the morning we're
[3:27:51.720 --> 3:27:59.480]  out in nuclear war i'm very very happy exactly and there's also a lot of hypocrisy going on
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:04.360]  you know tillerson came out and said us will hold to account any state or group that targets
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:10.120]  innocence that commits atrocities saudi arabia has been committing atrocities in yemen for about a
[3:28:10.120 --> 3:28:16.360]  year now you know you got 5000 civilians dead the us sold them the weapons to do it they're not going
[3:28:16.360 --> 3:28:23.320]  to confront saudi arabia this line that they're just going to attack anyone who commits any atrocity
[3:28:23.320 --> 3:28:30.520]  it's complete bs alex and like i said a lot of the rhetoric sounds like 2002 2003 if you switch
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:37.960]  on fox news and listen to these talking heads they're salivating paul i'm sorry to jump in it's
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:41.800]  hard to get you to an hour a week i wish you do hours every day you do a great job and then

[3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:27.160]  the world is just entering crazier and crazier times that's why it's more important than ever
[3:29:27.160 --> 3:29:32.520]  that you be engaged and you be involved seeing and criticizing us for not wanting war in syria
[3:29:32.520 --> 3:29:37.960]  and their peace alt-right terms on president trump we didn't turn on trump we turned on a policy
[3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:43.320]  and we're having a big effect right now backing it up paul joseph watson straight ahead from london

[3:30:07.560 --> 3:30:16.040]  flag and more are on the way we have information from various sources that a similar provocation
[3:30:16.040 --> 3:30:20.920]  and i can't call it anything other than a provocation is being prepared in other parts of syria
[3:30:20.920 --> 3:30:26.600]  including the southern suburbs of damaskus where they're again prepared to release some similar
[3:30:26.600 --> 3:30:31.880]  chemical substances and accuse the syrian authorities of using them putin went on to
[3:30:31.880 --> 3:30:38.920]  compare the situation in syria to saddam hussein's non-existence weapons of mass destruction which
[3:30:38.920 --> 3:30:45.640]  may indicate that he believes the u.s is either behind the false flag or actively pushing the
[3:30:45.640 --> 3:30:51.800]  propaganda meanwhile the russian government says syrian forces possess no chemical weapons
[3:30:51.800 --> 3:30:58.120]  and any further attacks in syria by the united states will be unacceptable and you can learn

[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:38.680]  with big news he is jack persobeck hope i'm pronouncing that right at jack persobeck on twitter
[3:33:38.680 --> 3:33:45.160]  navy intel veteran founder citizens for trump jack welcome to the show how's it going paul and you
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:50.600]  got it perfectly right uh you know it's it's crazy to say that uh you know they say may you want not
[3:33:50.600 --> 3:33:55.160]  live in interesting times and so i've just started up working with rebel media here in
[3:33:55.160 --> 3:33:59.160]  washington dc and you couldn't have asked for two more interesting weeks that we find ourselves in
[3:33:59.160 --> 3:34:04.920]  right now it's absolutely insane now we've got china saying that they would consider striking
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:10.440]  north korea's nuclear facilities you've got south korean citizens panicking that war is imminent
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:15.320]  they're having to be reassured by their own government your sources close to the trump administration
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:21.720]  who were accurate on the serious strike are now telling you what about north korea so they're
[3:34:21.720 --> 3:34:27.240]  essentially telling me this that a a strike is being planned and it is being discussed at the
[3:34:27.240 --> 3:34:32.360]  highest levels of the national security council uh essentially they are passing intelligence
[3:34:32.360 --> 3:34:37.960]  reports summaries or assessments as they call them to the president saying that they believe
[3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:44.360]  that kim jong-un is preparing to use his nuclear arsenal to prevent regime change and that the only
[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:49.640]  way and that kim believes the only way to stop himself or from losing power is to use those
[3:34:49.640 --> 3:34:54.280]  nukes so they're telling trump this this is people like h star mcmaster people like dina paul that
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:34:58.360]  are giving this information to trump the same way they gave him information regarding the chemical
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:06.120]  weapon strike last week uh which may have a a influence on him ordering a strike of north korea
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:10.920]  either uh striking one of their ballistic missile delivery systems or possibly even the nuclear
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:17.640]  facility itself and this source was as he said proven correct with the serious strike you tweeted
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:22.760]  earlier you know he said he was 75 percent sure of the serious strike that happened you're saying
[3:35:22.760 --> 3:35:28.200]  50 percent sure that this will happen do you have any kind of timescale and indication of how imminent
[3:35:28.200 --> 3:35:35.880]  this may be they're talking soon uh he told me about 10 a.m. on last thursday morning uh that the
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:41.720]  u.s. would be striking serious 75 chance and it was about 14 hours later that that strike actually
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:48.120]  took place uh there were eight hours later then uh so today this morning he texted me uh essentially
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:54.760]  as they texted to as a as a phrase i'm not divulging any sources or methods here but he basically
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:58.920]  got it across to me that it would be looking at either today or tomorrow possibly by the end of the
[3:35:58.920 --> 3:36:06.040]  week absolutely incredible and as i said earlier with alex you know the polls that i've run amongst
[3:36:06.040 --> 3:36:11.320]  my audience who aren't normally that militaristic uh you know 70 30 opposed the military strike in
[3:36:11.320 --> 3:36:18.040]  syria they're now saying it's running currently at 50 50 supporting an attack on north korea you
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:22.680]  could make the argument that you know he is belligerent he does have nuclear weapons he has
[3:36:22.680 --> 3:36:27.240]  threatened the united states it seems there'd be more support for this than there would for the
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:33.880]  syria attack even though there is uh i'm unhappy to say broadly quite a consensus of support if
[3:36:33.880 --> 3:36:39.640]  you believe the polls uh for the syria attack do you think that trump voters will get behind this
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:45.800]  north korea attack the political situation would definitely be a little different with a north
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:50.600]  korea attack because there are indications that china's seems to be pulling away from supporting
[3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:55.640]  north korea but at the same time as you said north korea has not done anything belligerent
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:37:00.760]  there has been no situation where they've used uh or chemical weapons have been used in north korea
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:05.400]  there are no current hostilities going on in north korea like the the current civil war situation
[3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:11.720]  in syria so to find people saying that uh if anything this seems like it would turn essentially
[3:37:11.720 --> 3:37:16.680]  what's a cold war into a hot war and i think that from the political thought that from that could
[3:37:16.680 --> 3:37:22.120]  be very disastrous for trump as he loses a lot of his base that voted for him for the specific
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:29.400]  reason that he did not want us get involved in more wars you have nuclear experts in south korea
[3:37:29.400 --> 3:37:34.360]  also saying that there is a plan to strike that main nuclear facility in north korea things are
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:39.080]  getting hot in a hurry but you know we had this whole military escalation and you touched on it
[3:37:39.080 --> 3:37:44.840]  there immediately after steve bannon who according to reports and people have contested this with me
[3:37:44.840 --> 3:37:51.000]  but according to reports was opposed to the syria strike he was demoted from the national security
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:57.880]  council of course this came what six weeks two months after flin general flin who predicted the
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:05.800]  rise of isis opposed destabilizing Assad was replaced with mcmaster to cut to the chase jack is
[3:38:05.800 --> 3:38:12.280]  everything we've seen over the past week a reflection of the fact that neocons are taking over or have
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:19.320]  taken over the trump administration at least in the sector of foreign policy so i'm in agreement
[3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:24.600]  with you on that paul i've broken down a couple of videos on rebel media getting into this it seems
[3:38:24.600 --> 3:38:29.560]  that the balance has shifted and at first people were talking about the trump administration
[3:38:29.560 --> 3:38:34.520]  particularly the national security council with bannon and flin there but also bringing people
[3:38:34.520 --> 3:38:39.800]  from goldman sacks people from the bush administration like gary kohn and dina powell
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:44.280]  bringing them on there it seemed as there was a balance between some of the more neoconservative
[3:38:44.280 --> 3:38:51.400]  wing and the nationalist wing but once flin was gone and once uh bannon was removed through a lot
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:55.480]  of these leaks a lot of these deep state tactics a lot of the spying that was going on that was
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:00.040]  definitely illegal involved with the obama administration suddenly that balance has shifted
[3:39:00.040 --> 3:39:05.560]  and we're seeing a major major shift in u.s policy because now you don't have anyone in the national
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:10.680]  security council that's essentially providing another option for trump they're saying this is
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:15.560]  the way to go they're putting generals in there and they're basically created an echo chamber of
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:19.480]  saying we need to attack we need to punch out we need to use violent military force and there
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:24.120]  isn't anyone saying hey maybe we can look at diplomacy maybe we're looking at clandestine
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:29.400]  operations intelligence situation solutions anything else that could be done it's no no no it's
[3:39:29.400 --> 3:39:33.480]  got to be strikes it's got to be big it's got to be loud and you don't have anybody else out there
[3:39:33.480 --> 3:39:38.440]  uh you know like bannon would have said to say well maybe there's other things we can do maybe
[3:39:38.440 --> 3:39:44.200]  we can cut deals with Assad maybe we can cut deals with putin if we can cut deals with china
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:48.920]  in order to bring this to a solution peacefully by putting everybody in a box rather than launching
[3:39:48.920 --> 3:39:56.360]  racy on tomahawk missiles at every issue and i mean it comes down to this you know 400 000 syrians
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:40:02.040]  have died in this civil war over the past six years before the chemical weapons attack a sat
[3:40:02.040 --> 3:40:08.200]  had been killing his own people for six years the jihadist rebels had been killing their own people
[3:40:08.200 --> 3:40:14.920]  for six years it's a civil war that's what happens so i don't think the big change was this supposed
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:21.560]  chemical weapons attack you know you had tillison even tillison on march 31st saying that Assad was
[3:40:21.560 --> 3:40:29.720]  part of syria's future that was the line just what 11 days ago you know how what changed one week later
[3:40:29.720 --> 3:40:36.520]  the only thing i can see is bannon being demoted right what i mean what else changed there's it's
[3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:41.720]  a fundamental shift within the administration and it's a fundamental shift basically with him
[3:40:41.720 --> 3:40:47.320]  out of the picture and with hr mcmaster now there hr mcmaster is tied to david betray us so we all
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:52.520]  know from the iraq war and and his subsequent uh demotion or sort of a basically resignation in
[3:40:52.520 --> 3:40:58.600]  disgrace he then became a hillary clinton's uh campaign advisor dina power herself she's on the
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:04.040]  national security now council now she's under mcmaster she is close personal friends not only
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:09.080]  with avonka trump but also valery jarrett and a lot of people that are involved with the bahama
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:13.800]  administration and the bush administration so having these people in there it allows for them to
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:19.880]  create a way where they can feed trump any assessments any intel they want without any
[3:41:19.880 --> 3:41:26.120]  conflicting views there's now information out that says mike pompeo director of cia uh was
[3:41:26.120 --> 3:41:31.080]  actually in disagreement with the assessment on syria with in disagreement with the assessment
[3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:35.640]  on the chemical weapons and paul i know you've seen that picture of everyone sitting there
[3:41:35.640 --> 3:41:40.120]  they're watching the screen on marlago when the when the strikes took place mike pompeo the cia
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:45.560]  director is not in that in that room so for whatever reason the person who is dissenting
[3:41:45.560 --> 3:41:50.760]  about these strikes dissenting about the chemical weapons and how exactly they were employed wasn't
[3:41:50.760 --> 3:41:57.160]  even invited to the party it's amazing and what really concerns me is we're seeing this kind of
[3:41:57.160 --> 3:42:03.960]  jingoism which reminds me of pre iraq war invasion we're seeing anyone that questions this narrative
[3:42:04.600 --> 3:42:10.840]  being shamed now by a significant portion of trump supporters um you go online you look at the polls
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:17.560]  you know i've run polls we have a cult of personality we've got people saying prominent people i trust
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:23.800]  trump whatever he says or does i will follow and support him whatever he does that that's not
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:28.840]  acceptable you can't have a cult of personality where you will follow someone off the edge of
[3:42:28.840 --> 3:42:34.840]  the cliff we have to still have hope you know as happened with romney that trump will listen to his
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:40.520]  base there was a huge rebellion against romney his secretary of state they listened to us that
[3:42:40.520 --> 3:42:45.560]  appointment didn't happen you still think there's some hope there's some space where we could have
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:52.200]  an influence and try and de-escalate this rush to war you know and i think the best thing for all
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:57.800]  info wars viewers to understand is that social media is and this is my stern of itch's line
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:01.960]  i'm thoroughly stealing it from them social media is a direct conversation between you and
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:06.600]  president trump if you have a feeling about a certain situation about a certain policy that
[3:43:06.600 --> 3:43:11.160]  you don't like moving in a direction you can take the social media you can use things like
[3:43:11.160 --> 3:43:17.720]  periscope like facebook live like hashtags flash mobs get out there let your voice be heard and he
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:23.560]  will absolutely see that he will absolutely see it i know from from channels that team
[3:43:23.560 --> 3:43:29.640]  trump absolutely was looking at the massive massive schism that took place over the weekend
[3:43:29.640 --> 3:43:34.280]  between trump supporters and they were looking at it very very closely so you're seeing now
[3:43:34.280 --> 3:43:40.920]  in the past one option that operatives would use or staffers would use was leaking to
[3:43:40.920 --> 3:43:44.760]  the press and you know play it plan a story in politico plan a story in washington post from
[3:43:44.760 --> 3:43:49.640]  new york times to disgrace somebody get fired well now we're seeing that social media we all
[3:43:49.640 --> 3:43:55.800]  know how much the trump won in in part of because of social media how that can be used as an interactive
[3:43:55.800 --> 3:44:00.760]  dialogue with trump to let him know whether you think he's a perceived but this or not and i think
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:04.840]  also that that's why you're seeing people like tillerson go out there and say things like oh we
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:09.800]  want regime change but you're also seeing people like sean splicer recently said saying that well
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:14.440]  this was just a limited strike um not sure how much they're sticking with that line it really
[3:44:14.440 --> 3:44:18.520]  does seem like they're trying to drive home the idea that they don't want to sod and power any
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:22.840]  more and if that is the case that's certainly something that's very different than what trump
[3:44:22.840 --> 3:44:29.160]  campaign on just a few months ago i mean we're seeing mixed messages every day they say we want
[3:44:29.160 --> 3:44:33.960]  to get rid of sad first then they say the ultimate goal is regime change the point i've made over and
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:41.400]  over again jack is a sad has fought a brutal civil war for six years under intense international
[3:44:41.400 --> 3:44:47.720]  pressure every single day to step down he's not just going to politely step down if the united
[3:44:47.720 --> 3:44:53.080]  states asks him to if russia asks him to it's not going to happen they're going to have to completely
[3:44:53.080 --> 3:44:58.440]  obliterate demascus to get rid of that regime and then what will come in in the aftermath what
[3:44:58.440 --> 3:45:05.240]  happened in libya you've now got slaves on the streets of libya being sold this was a prosperous
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:11.080]  country this was a tourist destination now it's a complete ruin refugees are streaming out of
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:16.200]  there into europe that's what caused the problem in the first place was foreign intervention yet
[3:45:16.200 --> 3:45:21.960]  we're seeing it again and we're seeing this cult of personality where you just you can't even question
[3:45:21.960 --> 3:45:27.080]  it you're off the trump train even if you say well now we're just criticizing we're trying to influence
[3:45:27.080 --> 3:45:32.040]  the other thing that concerns me jack is we have these reports circulating again today that
[3:45:33.160 --> 3:45:39.720]  trump was influenced to launch the strike on syria because evanke was sad at seeing some pictures
[3:45:39.720 --> 3:45:46.200]  you know is it wise for potentially war starting decisions to be made on the basis of how much
[3:45:46.200 --> 3:45:52.840]  something upsets trump's daughter you know i think during the campaign revanke trump mostly came out
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:58.440]  there she gave very scripted very crafted statements she mostly stuck on public policy issues she
[3:45:58.440 --> 3:46:02.760]  talked about women's issues she talked about children's issues she talked about child care i
[3:46:02.760 --> 3:46:09.880]  remember that was popular with a lot of voters there was no um discussion of evanke trump or her
[3:46:09.880 --> 3:46:15.960]  husband jared kushner being involved in military decisions in military policy and uh everybody
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:20.920]  saw the the pictures of jared kushner traveling through iraq uh over the weekend and that started
[3:46:20.920 --> 3:46:26.440]  the the hashtag kushner at war and just a lot of people looking at this and saying it was that what
[3:46:26.440 --> 3:46:31.320]  we voted for uh we voted for somebody who was going to come in that was going to listen to sound
[3:46:31.320 --> 3:46:36.760]  advice that was going to campaign on the ideas of america first rather than you know have this
[3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:41.720]  this family idea but it seems and what i'm seeing within the trump administration and my sources are
[3:46:41.720 --> 3:46:47.800]  confirming to me that evanke and kushner are siding more with gary kohn with dina powell people that
[3:46:47.800 --> 3:46:52.360]  they have personal relationships with a lot of these folks have spent a lot of time in manhattan
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:56.600]  a lot of the time they have spent in uh and a lot of them are registered democrats gary kohn
[3:46:56.600 --> 3:47:02.360]  is a registered democrat um a lot of them it's it's personal manhattan social aid relationships
[3:47:02.360 --> 3:47:08.680]  and it may be that they're putting that ahead of um of where they are and it's hard to say it's
[3:47:08.680 --> 3:47:14.280]  hard to say who then is influencing evanke who then is influencing jared kushner because they
[3:47:14.280 --> 3:47:18.760]  know that they have the ear of president trump so it may not be something where evanke wittingly
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:22.920]  was doing this but she may have been put up to it by people that she is associated with
[3:47:22.920 --> 3:47:26.920]  who then get into deeper and deeper nefarious connections it's very swampy it's very swampy
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:31.800]  that's the situation basically and and one good point here is that steve bannon early on in the
[3:47:31.800 --> 3:47:37.960]  campaign didn't or in the election did not do very much to bring in those campaign supporters
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:42.600]  those people who are out there supporting trump that supported the america first gender to put
[3:47:42.600 --> 3:47:46.760]  them into the white house the white house office of personnel management is being completely run
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:50.680]  by never trumpers right now and so they're basically taking staffers from congress they're
[3:47:50.680 --> 3:47:54.520]  taking staffers from goldman sacks they're bringing all these people in that weren't
[3:47:54.520 --> 3:47:59.000]  associated with trump that didn't want anything to do with trump early on and they can work to
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:04.280]  undermine him all day long and set the agenda to what they want and that is what what it means
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:10.760]  when people talk about the deep state it's incredible i mean i'm looking at this and i'm
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:17.960]  seeing on social media on twitter probably 50 50 support the escalation militarily whether it be
[3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:25.240]  syria or north korea 50 opposed but then you look at the polls you look at gallup 86 of republicans
[3:48:25.240 --> 3:48:31.880]  presumably almost all of whom were trump supporters supported the strike on syria i reckon it's a
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:36.440]  difference between low information and high information people if you look at all the prominent
[3:48:36.440 --> 3:48:42.440]  trump supporters whether it be angkul to michael savage you know people on youtube stephan mollin
[3:48:42.440 --> 3:48:48.200]  you very prominent people with large audiences russia limbaugh as well from what i recall
[3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:54.360]  are opposed to this military escalation opposed to the strike on syria and yet 86 percent of
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:49:00.360]  republicans according to gallup support it i reckon it's high information and low information a lot
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:05.880]  of people have just been hud winked into going along trump says it's good so it must be good
[3:49:05.880 --> 3:49:11.800]  they don't have a grasp jack of this deep state tug of war that's been happening for the past three
[3:49:11.800 --> 3:49:17.960]  months and it's turning into a cult of personality what do you think well i think uh we definitely
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:22.680]  learned through the election campaign exactly how much we can trust polls when the same organizations
[3:49:22.680 --> 3:49:27.320]  were saying on the morning of november 8th that hillary clinton had a 90 chance of winning the
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:32.040]  presidency we've seen that these people have used the polls in the past as a way of of basically
[3:49:32.040 --> 3:49:37.000]  creating a psychological operation by essentially putting false information out to make it look
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:40.920]  like something is popular when it's not to prop up one side or the other and these polls have
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:45.160]  frequently been used to craft and condition opinion public opinion out there say oh you
[3:49:45.160 --> 3:49:48.760]  must believe it you have to go on with everybody else i mean that's that's a human psychological
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:53.560]  condition uh that that it seems it's it's easier to go with the flow than it is to stand up and
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:57.800]  be a voice like people here at info wars too and that's why i love this station so much
[3:49:57.800 --> 3:50:02.200]  and that's what rebel media does and we do the same thing we stand up there and we ask questions
[3:50:02.200 --> 3:50:07.800]  and when the media and these polls were so wrong throughout the entire election campaign why all
[3:50:07.800 --> 3:50:13.240]  of a sudden if you support trump on this do you also agree with the polls and these media
[3:50:13.240 --> 3:50:18.600]  organizations like new york times which is owned by mexico like the washington post which we know
[3:50:18.600 --> 3:50:24.040]  is financed by the cia through jet jeff bezos and amazon why are we now supporting the people
[3:50:24.040 --> 3:50:30.520]  that we all said don't listen to because they're putting out fake news and also why are we trusting
[3:50:30.520 --> 3:50:35.800]  an intelligence community that was 100 percent wrong when they talked about trump colluding with
[3:50:35.800 --> 3:50:40.680]  russia you know everybody said where's the evidence this is just a claim but yet suddenly
[3:50:40.680 --> 3:50:45.400]  oh they're totally believable when it comes to blaming us out for the gas attack with no independent
[3:50:45.400 --> 3:50:51.480]  investigation whatsoever the disconnect is amazing we've got the next segment coming up with jack

[3:54:20.200 --> 3:54:24.440]  russian-adortment team bus in germany that's the soccer team in germany has been
[3:54:24.440 --> 3:54:31.880]  hit by an explosion after three bombs were hidden in a roadside hedge thankfully only one person
[3:54:31.880 --> 3:54:36.760]  one of the team members was slightly injured they're looking at that as a terrorist incident
[3:54:37.400 --> 3:54:43.400]  over in sweden of course we had the stock home attack last week the truck attack basically
[3:54:43.400 --> 3:54:47.800]  everybody's already forgotten about it because it happens on an almost weekly basis in europe now
[3:54:47.800 --> 3:54:53.560]  because we're being culturally enriched jack you visited sweden recently to produce a documentary
[3:54:53.560 --> 3:55:01.000]  um sweden democrats now are the most popular party in sweden no surprise they're the anti-immigrant
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:06.440]  party after the attack in stock home their approval rating has shot up do you think sweden
[3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:12.840]  another european country still have time to reverse these disastrous policies or is it too late
[3:55:13.880 --> 3:55:17.960]  you know i absolutely think they do paul uh when i was there producing documentary
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:23.400]  the sternovich media we called it invasion how sweden became the rape capital of the west
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:29.880]  and we saw that uh the attitudes and the opinions of the people in sweden were still even at that
[3:55:29.880 --> 3:55:35.160]  time this was back in january so even prior to trump's sweden comments that that really brought
[3:55:35.160 --> 3:55:40.120]  this issue to the forefront we were actually ahead of that we saw opinions and attitudes
[3:55:40.120 --> 3:55:46.920]  were only undergoing already a bit of a shift people were waking up after so many years and keep
[3:55:46.920 --> 3:55:51.560]  in mind this has been going on since the 1970s in sweden it's only been in the last two or three
[3:55:51.560 --> 3:55:57.800]  years that it's really turned on at such a high clip after this current uh migrant crisis so people
[3:55:57.800 --> 3:56:03.560]  with so many so quickly flooding into uh into sweden from the third world from the middle east
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:08.040]  at this time sweden already is one of the least populated countries in the world i think it ranks
[3:56:08.040 --> 3:56:13.240]  like 120th out of that and people are now looking around saying our our country does not look like
[3:56:13.240 --> 3:56:19.640]  it was before now sweden is being uh overrun with these rapes there was a live stream rape
[3:56:19.640 --> 3:56:25.640]  of a swedish girl by three afghans uh the same week that we were there filming the documentary
[3:56:25.640 --> 3:56:31.000]  facebook it was on facebook live streamed it's actually not even being so facebook won't allow
[3:56:31.000 --> 3:56:35.320]  the live stream that video to be released to the swedish authorities because they're saying it's
[3:56:35.320 --> 3:56:40.760]  someone's private property and they should they shouldn't allow uh this evidence of a crime a
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:45.320]  three hour crime i should bind you to be released because it was their private video on a private
[3:56:45.320 --> 3:56:49.640]  facebook page and i think that the swedish people at this point have finally realized that between
[3:56:49.640 --> 3:56:55.800]  that uh between the horrific attacks in Stockholm that it's it's got to stop it's absolutely got
[3:56:55.800 --> 3:57:01.000]  to stop and whether or not they have a chance left i think that they do i think that if sweden
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:05.960]  starts to roll back some of these the main drivers of what's bringing people there that they will
[3:57:05.960 --> 3:57:10.840]  start going away sweden is handing money hand over fist to these people for absolutely nothing
[3:57:10.840 --> 3:57:14.440]  that's the reason they're there you talk to these people they're not from syria they're not fleeing
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:19.640]  some sort of uh refugee humanitarian crisis they're from all across the middle east and they know
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:23.480]  that the average swede can't tell somebody apart they say if you're arab you're arab if you're brown
[3:57:23.480 --> 3:57:27.800]  you're brown to an extent and they're putting in fake ids there's no vetting going on and they're
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:33.320]  getting free money if sweden starts to turn that off you will see an immediate shift the same way
[3:57:33.320 --> 3:57:38.200]  in the united states here we're already seeing an immediate drop off in illegal immigrants crossing
