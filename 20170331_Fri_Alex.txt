[00:00.000 --> 00:28.880]  Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.520]  you know I've had the general Flynn scoop
[00:36.000 --> 00:41.440]  since before he was even named as the national security advisor to the president when the president
[00:41.440 --> 00:52.560]  was president-elect uh back in December of 2016 and they had lawyers look at it and it was decided
[00:52.560 --> 00:58.880]  that it was just a paperwork issue uh lobbying for turkey after he retired four years ago five years
[00:58.880 --> 01:07.280]  ago or been sacked by obamas what really happened and so that's the issue they're going to bring
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.800]  up and that's why they've targeted Flynn and the reason they've targeted Flynn is he led the group
[01:13.760 --> 01:15.680]  of retired and current military
[01:19.040 --> 01:25.200]  and was the point guy to say no to backing radical Islam and the whole Obama triple cross of America
[01:25.200 --> 01:30.000]  and of course we told you about that with Senator Paul at the time and Senator Cruz
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.080]  but of course Colonel Shaper first broke it here the week of Benghazi that was when the
[01:34.080 --> 01:38.800]  military said that's it we know what the plan is and we're not going along with it and since then
[01:38.800 --> 01:43.360]  that's all come out that's not a theory it's not speculation that's now accepted known fact and the
[01:43.360 --> 01:51.200]  congress knows it and so Flynn was told at the time we're going to destroy you and so Dr. Corsi
[01:51.200 --> 01:57.200]  I know Dr. Corsi's source I'm obviously not going to say Dr. Corsi's source but I separately
[01:57.920 --> 02:02.240]  have that same source so leave it at that of course everyone listening to my phone
[02:03.040 --> 02:07.600]  when I'm having these phone calls knows exactly who our sources are but it's highly respected
[02:07.600 --> 02:14.000]  bipartisan highest level retired general just as high as it gets just I'll leave it at that
[02:14.000 --> 02:20.240]  there's only maybe living maybe six or seven of those guys okay so I'll just leave it at that
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.800]  the enemy knows exactly who it is but all the documents everything of course he has it
[02:25.920 --> 02:29.680]  in fact this headline isn't even strong enough on full wars dot com
[02:29.680 --> 02:35.760]  US senior retired military dims scapegoating general Flynn circulated email it reveals
[02:36.400 --> 02:42.720]  what the media won't tell you and then he can then be pointed at an email that's been put out that
[02:42.720 --> 02:51.360]  basically gets into the secretive info you know happening behind the scenes but the headline
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.240]  should be and by the course he's amazing or it's like three articles a day three time number one
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.760]  New York Times bestseller author we all know that it's just that Paul him they all tend to water
[03:01.760 --> 03:09.200]  down the sensational stuff that's going on I'm in the top Democrat official comes out and says
[03:09.200 --> 03:14.960]  we were spying on Trump on MSNBC and we say did she just admit it Farkas no I mean she said it
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.480]  but there's no question mark needed she just did it but Paul knows what he's doing I guess
[03:20.480 --> 03:23.840]  you get more people to read it if there's a question mark I just it's it's it's it's not a
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.600]  question mark but I don't know how to like put a headline on this because of course he gets the
[03:27.600 --> 03:34.000]  best info but then the headlines just US senior retired military dims scapegoating general Flynn
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.800]  circulated email reveals what the media won't tell you and I guess then you read the article but
[03:42.800 --> 03:51.360]  but I mean what it really is is you know top military sources of dims targeting Flynn
[03:55.040 --> 03:59.600]  or dims targeting you know top insider would be the headline top insider
[03:59.600 --> 04:03.280]  dims targeting
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.440]  or general Flynn being targeted because he did not back
[04:10.720 --> 04:17.120]  Obama's al Qaeda slash ISIS takeover the Middle East or Saudi Arabia's ISIS takeover I don't
[04:17.120 --> 04:21.840]  know how you want to say that that's what he did that's why the guy's a hero that's why the media
[04:21.840 --> 04:29.840]  demonizes him that's why they're going after him it's why all this happened and I know for the fact that
[04:29.840 --> 04:35.120]  of course he was working at the Jones group which is one of the biggest private groups out there now
[04:35.760 --> 04:39.360]  with the former head of the national security council I mean the former head of the US
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.760]  you know national security council of general Jones and Jones was actually originally offered
[04:45.760 --> 04:49.680]  the job and said I'm not doing I can do more good outside of this thing so they sent Flynn
[04:49.680 --> 04:53.040]  and he's basically ordered into this again he didn't want to do it and so now you see him
[04:53.040 --> 05:21.280]  crucifying him we'll be right back folks stay with us that's exactly what's going on
[05:21.280 --> 05:23.360]  Key
[05:44.880 --> 05:46.880]  This is my first time
[05:46.880 --> 05:52.320]  is revoked as a precautionary measure due to concerns that they were becoming radicalized.
[05:52.320 --> 05:57.600]  According to the report, at least one had access to runways and had been the subject of a police
[05:57.600 --> 06:03.920]  investigation. Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its
[06:03.920 --> 06:08.800]  benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk. We are now introducing
[06:08.800 --> 06:15.040]  Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root,
[06:15.040 --> 06:21.680]  chaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula. Caveman, it's
[06:21.680 --> 06:26.080]  those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior
[06:26.080 --> 06:30.960]  ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that. Everyone knew that you used
[06:30.960 --> 06:35.280]  all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used
[06:35.280 --> 06:41.200]  the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and kiko factors to the marrow
[06:41.200 --> 06:46.480]  that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence. I'm a long way from
[06:46.480 --> 06:51.360]  the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made
[06:51.360 --> 06:55.120]  us what we were and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out Caveman

[07:53.520 --> 08:18.640]  infowarslife.com. It's the win-win infowarslife.com. If you are receiving this transmission,
[08:18.640 --> 08:26.400]  you are the resistance. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:30.640 --> 08:36.560]  March 31st, 2017 on this Friday edition. Thank you so much for joining us. I am your host Alex Jones.
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.400]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[08:41.200 --> 08:44.560]  We have Dr. Jordan Corsi with Big Breaking News joining us the bottom of the hour.
[08:44.560 --> 08:51.360]  Greg Sawyer, very famous Navy SEAL and of course even more famous in the Navy SEALs
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.920]  groups he's led. And then of course we also have Leanne McAdoo going to be joining us to cover a
[08:57.920 --> 09:03.920]  host of issues in the third hour. David Knight will always kick butt in the fourth hour.
[09:05.600 --> 09:12.160]  You know I think it's important to correct things when we're wrong and to come out and
[09:12.160 --> 09:17.520]  point it out because if you start telling yourself you're not wrong about things and you get arrogant
[09:19.040 --> 09:25.680]  that way leads obviously into destruction. But I also have to hype myself up energy wise to
[09:25.680 --> 09:33.360]  continue on at this level against these people and you know then it makes me behave on air sometimes
[09:36.320 --> 09:41.920]  worse than I would do in private. I think there's a fine line of showing people I don't care what
[09:41.920 --> 09:45.600]  the globalists do and trying to get people to build their confidence and take action I don't do
[09:45.600 --> 09:54.320]  any of it on purpose. I just when I get nasty or I never cussed on air in 20 years of broadcasting
[09:54.320 --> 09:58.720]  and now they've got to delay me on a routine basis so I don't just say this as a I'm sorry I just
[09:58.720 --> 10:02.880]  said that I'm going to quit and the station's having a complaint as we delay it all out.
[10:04.320 --> 10:10.640]  I'm going to stop it and be more professional because the but give me a little bit of slack too
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.720]  because man I'm really sick of these people and I just quite frankly
[10:19.680 --> 10:22.400]  I don't know how they're so evil but it hit me this morning
[10:25.600 --> 10:32.800]  it hit me this morning that this is directed evil and I'm not the first person that would say
[10:32.800 --> 10:39.760]  directed evil I'm sure but that's everything you need to know it's a directed willful conscious
[10:39.760 --> 10:44.800]  giving yourself over to evil and people that aren't given over to evil
[10:49.840 --> 10:54.320]  we just can't understand why people do the things they do
[10:57.600 --> 10:58.640]  but let me tell you something
[10:58.640 --> 11:08.800]  um you look at the leadership of the democratic party and you look at the leadership of the
[11:08.800 --> 11:15.680]  EU and they look like villains out of a Hollywood movie and then you will research their backgrounds
[11:16.240 --> 11:23.760]  into a man into a woman they come from swindlers and killers and scammers and that's the
[11:23.760 --> 11:28.960]  that's the that's the low level it's I spent probably four to five minutes yesterday on
[11:31.920 --> 11:33.840]  John Claude Junker
[11:39.760 --> 11:46.240]  whose family were in the top three richest Nazi families
[11:46.240 --> 11:54.160]  he basically the Nazis captured Luxembourg the richest place in the world per square mile
[11:56.240 --> 11:58.400]  and he is the basically the king of it
[12:00.400 --> 12:04.720]  and now he's the head of the EU we have these squatting degenerate
[12:05.280 --> 12:07.920]  politicos tax exempt above the law
[12:07.920 --> 12:16.560]  the Nazis didn't get gotten rid of at the end of world war two the rich ones all just got phased
[12:16.560 --> 12:22.800]  in to the whole globalist system and then they hung a few of them for you know show
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.640]  you know the ones that were known in the newsreels like Hermann Göring or Heinrich Himmler knew
[12:28.640 --> 12:34.960]  too much they gave him cyanide right away and of course Rudolf Haas who died in the tower of
[12:34.960 --> 12:44.960]  London decades later the vice fuhrer who landed he parachuted out of his fighter bomber in the
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.680]  middle of world war two and like came down in one of the main palaces David had intelligence
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.000]  where the where the king was going to be at and he comes down landing or this parachute runs up
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.840]  because I have the treaty treaty the plan they said no you're going to the tower jack bye bye
[13:10.400 --> 13:11.360]  talk about amazing
[13:15.760 --> 13:21.520]  talk about incredible that's just one little piece of absolute fact history
[13:21.520 --> 13:29.360]  that Edward VIII was going to be the king of Europe and set over the European Union devised
[13:29.360 --> 13:39.920]  by Adolf Hitler people say well why would a Brit be the king of the EU because he was he wasn't
[13:39.920 --> 13:52.240]  he was German slash Hungarian and that's what's so crazy is you look at it and you see the
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.320]  alliances with the Nazis and Islam and all the rest of it and you just pull back and you're like
[13:56.320 --> 14:02.640]  oh my god it was all run by British intelligence the whole time which isn't even British intelligence
[14:02.640 --> 14:08.720]  it's it's families that go back over a thousand years in all the giant wars in Europe that figured
[14:08.720 --> 14:15.520]  out how to run the most duplicitous operations and then the world is basically run by a mindset
[14:15.520 --> 14:19.680]  developed by medieval Transylvanians
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.320]  and then they tell you in all the literature and you know oh the you know the the elite
[14:30.320 --> 14:33.360]  you know they're into grabbing kids they're into drinking blood they're into doing all this stuff
[14:33.360 --> 14:39.920]  then becomes legend and oh and they live forever and they you know fly around like bats no they're
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.960]  just into whatever they want ladies and gentlemen and it's hiding in plain view
[14:48.320 --> 14:54.960]  and it's so ridiculous that it's just hard to even believe isn't it look at drugsreport.com right now
[14:54.960 --> 15:06.320]  WikiLeaks release shows how the CIA uses computer code to hide the origins of attacking attacks
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.760]  and disguise them as Russian or Chinese activity you know I told some of the crew here and I love
[15:11.760 --> 15:16.880]  them to death I told them about a week ago I said we need another article about how in the vault
[15:16.880 --> 15:23.200]  seven from a month ago that nobody hardly covered it says that they can plant stuff on your computer
[15:23.200 --> 15:28.800]  but also have computer programs they call it marble or in real time you can even pose as
[15:28.800 --> 15:34.640]  your Russians or Chinese or Bangladeshis or whoever you want Mexicans whatever Germans
[15:36.160 --> 15:40.320]  and in real time sit there and type it all out and then frame people
[15:41.840 --> 15:46.800]  and we have a clip of that we're going to plan a moment but I'm not complaining about my great
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.280]  crew but they looked and they went that's already been in the news and I said but no one noticed it
[15:51.280 --> 15:56.160]  so we have to rewrite a story and I want to cover it and of course we didn't
[15:56.960 --> 16:00.800]  I guess we have covered some of the reporters have so they've done a great job I'm not complaining
[16:00.800 --> 16:06.080]  this is just what I deal with all day knowing what we're saying is all true there's total proof
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.520]  and then it never even gets any attention so thank god drudge now because this is pertinent
[16:11.520 --> 16:24.160]  with all this stuff about oh they have Russian computers trying to get into Trump tower and all
[16:24.160 --> 16:29.760]  this crap most people have different types of spyware on their computer that could be made by
[16:29.760 --> 16:35.840]  Chinese hacker a year ago five years ago Russian who knows and then they say oh that's the proof
[16:35.840 --> 16:43.840]  and then Marco Rubio comes out and says I was a victim at least two of my staff in the campaign
[16:43.840 --> 16:50.160]  when he had like 300 people working for him oh my gosh two of their computers had some spyware on it
[16:50.160 --> 16:53.760]  associated with the Russians I looked it up four years ago
[16:58.160 --> 17:00.560]  and then of course it comes out that most of this is being produced
[17:01.760 --> 17:05.680]  by western intelligence agencies because let's face it we've got the biggest brain trust
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.680]  and it's out there spoofing all this but that's all they talk about that's all they push that's all
[17:11.680 --> 17:19.440]  they do and now general Flynn the article's up on info wars.com huge bombshell directly from
[17:22.800 --> 17:25.920]  the highest levels of the recently retired military I'll just leave it at that
[17:26.880 --> 17:31.040]  but as high as you get and then the government knows the source I don't even know why we don't
[17:31.040 --> 17:38.560]  give the source but I mean I get it the point is US senior retired military dim scapegoating
[17:38.560 --> 17:43.040]  general Flynn okay great let's change the headline let's change it here because
[17:45.600 --> 17:46.800]  it's so much bigger than that
[17:50.640 --> 17:55.520]  you know top general that'd be the headline
[17:55.520 --> 18:03.120]  Obama targeting Flynn for blocking Saudi Islamic invasion
[18:04.800 --> 18:09.840]  and by the way Flynn blocked it through Turkey into Europe
[18:13.040 --> 18:15.680]  that's what you're supposed to do when you're in the military and over the defense intelligence
[18:15.680 --> 18:19.680]  agency is say no and then go to the joint chiefs and the chairman of the time Dempsey
[18:19.680 --> 18:24.160]  and say go to Obama four plus years ago and say we're not going to be the air force for al-qaeda
[18:24.160 --> 18:30.800]  now known as ISIS that was all Obama that was all the Arab spring that was all Google
[18:30.800 --> 18:35.920]  at all bragging remember Anderson Cooper on TV saying yay Libya we're freeing him yay
[18:35.920 --> 18:42.560]  overthrowing hazy mubarak yay the freedom fighters in Egypt in Syria and HBO movies
[18:42.560 --> 18:49.120]  and Netflix movies about how great the liberators are and you know fighting the evil Syrian
[18:49.120 --> 18:56.080]  government of Assad because he's let's Jews and non-radical Muslims and Christians and
[18:56.080 --> 19:00.080]  people live there in peace oh no can't have the second oldest Christian settlement the world
[19:00.080 --> 19:04.800]  still survive blow it up for sure so
[19:08.960 --> 19:13.360]  I'm not bitching about course his headline I'm just simply saying we've got to actually take
[19:13.360 --> 19:22.800]  the magnitude of what this is top general whistleblower you know dishes this top insider
[19:22.800 --> 19:29.520]  Dems targeting Flynn because he spoke out against ISIS that's pretty good it's not exactly what I
[19:29.520 --> 19:32.560]  said and this kind of a fun game here because not that I have all the answers I'm that's what
[19:32.560 --> 19:45.360]  we're wargaming this on air top insider Dems targeting Flynn because he blocked
[19:47.280 --> 19:50.400]  pop insider Dems targeting Flynn because he spoke out against ISIS
[19:52.800 --> 19:55.760]  I would just say al-qaeda slash ISIS invasion
[19:55.760 --> 20:02.640]  or Dems targeting Flynn because he blocked Obama's backing
[20:04.640 --> 20:09.360]  of al-qaeda slash ISIS that that would be the headline and then circulated email reveals
[20:09.360 --> 20:17.200]  what the media won't tell you and then see course he puts that in there because he legally
[20:17.200 --> 20:22.000]  he's always wants to win something classified coming out he wants to throw out that they
[20:22.000 --> 20:27.680]  made a mistake and open source put some of it out I had like a 20-minute conversation just
[20:27.680 --> 20:31.280]  to try to get this right so that I didn't say stuff I wasn't supposed this morning and
[20:33.280 --> 20:40.720]  I don't even know if it's just it's like trying to sit here I'm not complaining it's just this
[20:40.720 --> 20:46.880]  is such complex work I would just say info wars has obtained a copy of an email being circulated
[20:46.880 --> 20:51.840]  among retired US senior military officers regarding his request to be granted immunity as they
[20:51.840 --> 20:56.480]  condition of the testimony from prosecution exchange for his testimony before the house
[20:56.480 --> 21:01.120]  and Senate intelligence committees the body of the email is reproduced here without editing
[21:01.120 --> 21:06.240]  except for clarifications added in the text with brackets the email discussed appeared in
[21:06.240 --> 21:14.240]  parentheses in the original email so I guess we do make it about this
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.280]  but that's what I don't like you know I'll have the total proof with people that were there and
[21:21.280 --> 21:25.760]  witness at all and then I can't come tell you all that because it sources and then we have to
[21:25.760 --> 21:38.560]  sheep dip it and run it through some email okay I am so so sick of the evil people run in this
[21:38.560 --> 21:43.680]  country and then the good people are trying to block all this takeover and then I don't even know
[21:43.680 --> 21:51.520]  the American people to serve them I don't mean you or myself or my family your family I mean
[21:51.520 --> 21:59.200]  the snot noses out there that'll walk up to me on the street and almost always white people
[21:59.200 --> 22:04.240]  and say oh look it's the racist Alex Jones I got some magic word and hurts me when I'm the opposite
[22:04.240 --> 22:10.400]  of a racist trying to actually bring humanity together and they don't even care no it's like
[22:10.400 --> 22:17.360]  they're lobotomized ward hogs or something and they've got some magic word they're gonna use on me
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.520]  because they know that I am a prominent person so they want to feel big and powerful and just attack
[22:23.520 --> 22:28.400]  me and what I've learned is this a phenomenon is I don't follow Hollywood or the star stuff at all
[22:28.400 --> 22:35.440]  okay I did some in the past but just none I just can't stand it it's revolting almost all of it
[22:35.440 --> 22:39.760]  but now I guess there's this phenomenon Anthony was showing me the other day in the news he
[22:39.760 --> 22:45.200]  was oh that's a phenomenon where you could be a TV person or even a weather whether man or woman
[22:45.200 --> 22:52.640]  or you could be anything and people get really pissed because it's not just about money and class
[22:52.640 --> 23:03.040]  envy it's about like oh my god you're known so if I can say something bad to you I've elevated
[23:03.040 --> 23:08.400]  I've elevated myself and see it's almost like a wake up for these people though because I'm sick
[23:08.400 --> 23:12.720]  of celebrities that are just celebrities because they've got yachts or a hundred persons like Jim
[23:12.720 --> 23:18.640]  Kardashian all those other ridiculous crap so I guess with them that's kind of how they're waking up
[23:18.640 --> 23:26.400]  in a way because you know they're not celebrities so Madison Avenue and Wall Street and the culture
[23:26.400 --> 23:32.480]  makes them feel small by design so they've kind of just mutated now politically and they just hate
[23:32.480 --> 23:37.520]  everybody because you can't call Trendy's liberals we're talking about this this morning Austin
[23:38.400 --> 23:42.000]  has been colonized by the people that went to California trying to be famous
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.240]  and then now they've come here to colonize Austin they're not all bad but but most of them are
[23:48.240 --> 24:00.560]  the most vile hateful shelf-centered stupid stupid people and just guys walking around
[24:00.560 --> 24:07.680]  you know bumping into people trying to start fights and women you're sticking their lips out you know
[24:07.680 --> 24:13.040]  with a duck face you see everywhere taking selfies and you're just like I see it now in culture but
[24:13.040 --> 24:18.720]  on the street and it's like nauseating and let me tell you something 15 years ago I saw a beautiful
[24:18.720 --> 24:24.400]  woman who was arrogant I still think they were attracted if they're arrogant now it's revolting
[24:24.400 --> 24:31.680]  no matter how good-looking they are I don't know how to describe it anymore it's spiritual evil
[24:32.160 --> 24:35.120]  but then it mutates in with this holier-than-thou liberalism
[24:36.240 --> 24:39.440]  where they just want to run around like the new priest class
[24:41.520 --> 24:48.560]  and look for witches but they're little witch hunts but notice what the great qualifying thing
[24:48.560 --> 24:54.560]  about them is anything truly degenerate anything truly dangerous they're apologists for the most
[24:54.560 --> 25:02.240]  radical forms of orthodox viral spreading Islam population doubling every 20 years right as we
[25:02.240 --> 25:11.680]  speak or more and they're apologists for pedophilia all over the place and then we see references to
[25:11.680 --> 25:16.400]  pedophilia we see it pushed and we see it happening and we see sexualization of children all over
[25:16.400 --> 25:19.440]  Nickelodeon everywhere else and then they look at you and they go we don't know what you're talking
[25:19.440 --> 25:25.520]  about there's no such thing there's no such thing as radical Islam there's no such thing as pedophilia
[25:26.560 --> 25:33.200]  there's no such thing as any of this there's no world government there's no the Obamacare is free
[25:33.200 --> 25:46.000]  but again on some fronts they're capitulating on some fronts they are admitting okay we got a
[25:46.000 --> 25:52.160]  global government but it's good and it's not racist and so you should be for it nation states are
[25:52.160 --> 26:02.400]  racist so let us conquer them or you're a racist and then it's Jean-Claude Yonker the literal Nazi
[26:02.400 --> 26:16.080]  heir of the Prussian royal house who wears the black tuxedos with the red
[26:17.040 --> 26:23.760]  vest with the iron cross around his neck i mean literally wearing a count Dracula outfit you
[26:23.760 --> 26:29.360]  can't make this up because he is a vampire not a literal one but a literal one when it comes to
[26:29.360 --> 26:39.680]  culture and he was given Luxembourg the richest place in the world tax exempt where a Coca-Cola
[26:39.680 --> 26:45.120]  $100 a can because they don't want any poor people there and well known for every degradation
[26:45.120 --> 26:51.360]  and the Saudi princes in there flying in the little kids all of it i mean it is just beyond
[26:51.360 --> 26:58.880]  anything you can imagine he's the king of it sitting there where's the Nazi money there's no
[26:58.880 --> 27:06.000]  real Nazi hunting there were a few Jewish Nazi hunters that wanted to go after klaus barbie
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.480]  who was just a Gestapo officer he worked for the CIA and is it latin america so they told him
[27:10.480 --> 27:16.880]  you're not even allowed to have him he was mid-level does it mean gala and everybody else
[27:17.680 --> 27:25.440]  reportedly related to yonker of course more royalty more little counts gotta love a little
[27:25.440 --> 27:31.040]  counts just don't go out in the village at night near the castle or you know they told the kids
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.680]  they grab you when they drink your blood and the kids said what are they go they're vampires
[27:37.760 --> 27:46.560]  and they don't live forever but they're programmed us and everything they do is psychopaths
[27:46.560 --> 27:52.880]  inbred psychopaths interbreeding to create the ultimate psychopath super genius 200 IQs you
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.880]  name it oh they're smart you look what we're facing what we're battling here ladies and gentlemen it's
[27:58.880 --> 28:12.320]  hardcore we could beat them a guy that dresses up in count Dracula outfits that rules luxenberg
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.400]  owns it because the Nazis in took over luxenberg invaded it
[28:16.400 --> 28:24.240]  it with threat of force took it and then oh here yonker you get it here yonker you're royal
[28:25.520 --> 28:31.520]  and now you rule the unelected e you and threaten military action against countries that want to
[28:31.520 --> 28:34.880]  pull out that never voted to enter and then you threaten america with break up and that's what
[28:34.880 --> 28:44.880]  i'm saying if we can't say no to yonker then i guess we deserve to be sliced you've got a
[28:44.880 --> 28:55.760]  true nazi heir who has a the richest country in the world per capita as his and that's not enough
[28:55.760 --> 29:02.160]  now he's the e you had of the unelected bureaucracy that countermans everybody and threatens england
[29:02.160 --> 29:11.840]  that if they try to leave they'll destroy them financially and now they've got the muslims
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.480]  warmed up and urgun saying we'll burn down europe if you don't go along with merkel once
[29:17.120 --> 29:25.680]  and merkel smiles and goes good and then i get to have uneducated half-wit want to be tough guys
[29:25.680 --> 29:30.640]  wandering around the street going oh look it's alec jones screw you racist it's like some white
[29:30.640 --> 29:37.200]  twerp i'm just like somebody in a restaurant give i'm not going to eat here that racist is here

[30:07.040 --> 30:12.720]  fbi director james comey planned to write an op ed early last summer making the case that russia
[30:12.720 --> 30:18.560]  was meddling in the u.s election but other top obama administration officials vetoed the idea
[30:18.560 --> 30:23.280]  now that's according to a report from newsweek magazine the white house shut it down when
[30:23.280 --> 30:28.800]  source told the magazine of comey's op ed offered they did their usual nothing the revelation if
[30:28.800 --> 30:33.520]  accurate would appear to suggest that the obama administration did not take russia's meddling
[30:33.520 --> 30:38.640]  in the presidential campaign as seriously as many democrats would have liked comey who just took the
[30:38.640 --> 30:45.040]  fbi in 2013 proposed the op ed during a meeting in june or july in the situation room of the white
[30:45.040 --> 30:49.360]  house in which secretary of state john carrey attorney general loretta lynch and national
[30:49.360 --> 30:54.720]  security adviser susan wright and secretary of homeland security jet johnson were also present

[32:57.920 --> 33:19.200]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones secretary of defense
[33:19.200 --> 33:25.520]  mattis says north korea must be stopped absolutely talk about a false flag bill clinton
[33:25.520 --> 33:31.440]  hillary clinton publicly helped transfer the reactors to create the fissile material for atomic
[33:32.080 --> 33:37.920]  warheads that's all on record in the 1990s i covered it all but of course he covered it
[33:40.480 --> 33:45.280]  and we gave the communist chinese the entire icbm systems
[33:48.160 --> 33:53.520]  from launch to the boosters to guidance to separation to reentry to multiple warhead reentry
[33:53.520 --> 34:01.440]  devices everything and then i get to sit there and watch him say general flin is a trader
[34:03.600 --> 34:11.120]  for some turkey lobbying years after he was a general big story up on him for wars dot combat
[34:11.120 --> 34:18.800]  dr drone coursey dim's targeting flin because he blocked obama backing al qaeda isis invasion
[34:18.800 --> 34:22.240]  and of course we have more than just his email being circulated amongst top generals we're going
[34:22.240 --> 34:27.680]  to give our source but uh you know even more in telling why flin was told you will be destroyed
[34:27.680 --> 34:32.160]  for blocking the isis al qaeda operations four years ago and then you had colonel schaefer
[34:32.160 --> 34:37.760]  come out and everybody else but it was flin behind the scenes and again shape shaver just
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.000]  kind of like a spokesperson for the good folks in the military good people in the army and marines
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.360]  for that matter but he's like an authorized conduit by the resistance in our government
[34:47.360 --> 34:54.240]  to the globalist there's a true civil war here people in government happening the campaign
[34:54.240 --> 35:02.000]  was fun as as as hard fought as they you know it was this is the real war now i want to dr
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.600]  coursey here in a moment but just look at dr coursey top insider dim's targeting flin
[35:07.600 --> 35:12.640]  because he blocked obama backing al qaeda isis invasion here's another one this is from
[35:12.640 --> 35:22.640]  dr coursey march 7th so that's 20 plus days ago but 24 days ago cia can stage fake russian hacking
[35:22.640 --> 35:26.880]  to undermine trump now let's go to drudge report dot com and i'm glad drudge brought this back up
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.880]  because they're claiming oh there's these russian you know hacks going into uh marco rubio two
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.040]  computers out of hundreds had some software associated with russian hackers what the hell
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.720]  does that mean most computers have been hit by viruses from everywhere we have a war with
[35:44.080 --> 35:46.240]  nigeria because they create a bunch of viruses
[35:48.720 --> 35:53.680]  but they're creating fake russian ones and they're spoofing it and it's all broken down
[35:53.680 --> 35:57.360]  we're getting to that in a moment we have a clip of it but but notice a month ago he had the
[35:57.360 --> 36:05.360]  podesta situation about podesta getting russian money in exchange for uranium not that he declared
[36:05.360 --> 36:10.720]  it wrong notice we didn't get the season assist from john podesta daily caller did but but regardless
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.840]  they always change the subject their need deep under russian chinese and other foreign control
[36:15.840 --> 36:20.160]  they're like slot machines in my view hillary clinton the foundation is ongoing completely
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.480]  criminal did she get in trouble for all the illegal stuff no no flin asked for immunity
[36:27.680 --> 36:32.160]  because they want to put him in prison they want him to be the sacrificial lamb then bring down
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.880]  trump this is preposterous so we're going to go to dr corcy in a moment but again in in four wars
[36:38.880 --> 36:43.680]  dot com go to drudge report dot com you can see the daily mail about them spoofing getting into
[36:43.680 --> 36:48.160]  your computer posing as any country they want in live time with software that doesn't just
[36:48.160 --> 36:54.720]  show the fingerprints or or just spoof a foreign country but the text that's going on can be done
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.960]  in whatever language they want to further frame whoever they want of course it's the russians
[36:58.960 --> 37:04.400]  it's amazing and and how do i know this is all bull well number one they say i'm being
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.240]  directed by the russians i'm under criminal investigation people are like how you handling
[37:08.240 --> 37:13.840]  analex how am i handling it's like saying i'm under investigation for crucifying jesus
[37:13.840 --> 37:20.560]  two thousand years ago it's ridiculous but it shows how desperate they are and their master
[37:20.560 --> 37:26.800]  projection everybody knows it was the democrats who were literally under the control of the russians
[37:26.800 --> 37:32.960]  probably half the democrats were actual card carrying you hooked into the kgb you name it
[37:32.960 --> 37:36.800]  because it was encouraged by the big foundations here in the us that had gone and helped do that to
[37:36.800 --> 37:42.240]  russia it was actually foundations through russia back attacking america but but i'm gonna go back
[37:42.240 --> 37:49.520]  to the corcy here the point is that's the reality the very people they must be enjoying it now because
[37:49.520 --> 37:52.560]  they lost russia and they hate the fact that they don't have that as a godless you know totally
[37:52.560 --> 37:56.960]  controlled you know in place they can teach five-year-olds how to be trainees or whatever show
[37:56.960 --> 38:01.120]  and hollywood mixed their piss so now they're like we're gonna get russia and america but believe
[38:01.120 --> 38:05.600]  me the globalist hate america even more than russia we're gonna go to corcy here in just a moment
[38:05.600 --> 38:14.800]  of first off we have our deep cleanse products we have our liver cleanse we have uh the deep
[38:14.800 --> 38:19.680]  cleanse and the reason deep cleanse was out for eight months was because we were getting a shilligy
[38:19.680 --> 38:25.840]  from to bet that was just over harvested i mean i'll be honest that's the stuff that you know the
[38:25.840 --> 38:32.080]  special lichen moss that you know grows on certain rocks but actually there's oil of ancient forest
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.640]  and things is how it's explained in the rocks so it actually kind of bleeds out and then stuff
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.880]  grows on that and it's like the highest level of a bunch of heat detoxifying nutrients and things
[38:40.880 --> 38:45.040]  i just get the top experts to do it our products are rated five stars tens of thousands of ratings
[38:45.040 --> 38:51.840]  on major third-party sites the reason i raised that is we couldn't put it out for six eight
[38:51.840 --> 38:55.920]  months whatever it was because the shilligy was gone we had to get another one that was organic
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.160]  and would pass and it doesn't pass many places oh my god started getting it from russia we must
[39:00.160 --> 39:05.920]  work for the russia see you must work for the debatons before that well we run the same problem
[39:05.920 --> 39:10.080]  with iodine when we started popularizing the fact that it's the good halogen and you need it for
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.560]  yourself and your family and that uh the bad halogens like fluoride philip your glands and
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.360]  things when you don't have it and showed folks all the mainstream news about it it became a very
[39:19.360 --> 39:24.080]  very popular product we're getting a really clean one from seaweed but it was still going from memory
[39:24.080 --> 39:32.000]  like 99.9 and that sounds like really pure but it's not because iodine is like a it is a gaseous
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.400]  crystal form and when it's in nature it tends to bind to whatever it's with if you don't get the same
[39:36.400 --> 39:44.960]  absorption well this is we have to have a dea license for this and it's in a locked vault
[39:44.960 --> 39:48.480]  i'm not going to even say where and i'm not allowed to say where but i'd go through a major
[39:48.480 --> 39:55.760]  manufacturer to actually get pure iodine when i say pure with electron microscopes and spectrometers
[39:55.760 --> 40:01.360]  i'm not the expert they just tell it's like 9999999 whatever it eats through the ground one drop of
[40:01.360 --> 40:05.920]  it is like you know for the movie aliens that lead to the ground i mean it's just incredible that's how
[40:05.920 --> 40:12.720]  powerful it is but then it's put into a gaseous form injected into palm oil everybody wants this
[40:12.720 --> 40:19.920]  well we get it from natural gas drilling rig but only a few places actually extract it for other
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.200]  projects and pharmaceuticals that's why it's so controlled folks as you can not with what we sell
[40:25.200 --> 40:29.440]  it's it's been denatured and put into the palm oil but with with the pure stuff you know it's
[40:29.440 --> 40:35.520]  basically one one procedure it's methamphetamine and or a bunch of other stuff it's a key precursor
[40:35.520 --> 40:43.120]  but you're allowed to have it as an element so we had folks go in and buy us out of the best
[40:43.120 --> 40:47.920]  seaweed we were getting this is light years better and then we did deep research and found oh my gosh
[40:47.920 --> 40:52.480]  there's pharmaceutical grade we have a distributor in a manufacturer that has pharmaceutical grade
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.440]  licenses and people and so we're gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go to our guest this is key we have a
[40:57.440 --> 41:02.640]  big breaking news but this is important so we've been selling it for years it's super popular it's
[41:02.640 --> 41:06.240]  amazing it does a lot of things for people you should consult your physician before you take
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.760]  it that is you already have some issues it might you know well just consult your physician it's very
[41:09.760 --> 41:15.040]  powerful so if you don't have vitamin c you'll die what's the same thing with with with uh with this
[41:15.040 --> 41:20.560]  to them with b12 something with anything so for the first time in four years we are facing a major
[41:20.560 --> 41:26.320]  deep earth iodine shortage and basically i just think it's people want more money from us and they're
[41:26.320 --> 41:31.040]  like oh yeah you know you want to buy more of this because when they hit like 7 to 12,000 feet they're
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.640]  going 15,000 feet down to get natural gas this is right here in america there's only a few big fancy
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.720]  companies that do this and then it's all part of the intelligence ops they're running on us taking
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.920]  us off google taking us off ad role openly saying in the news they want to shut us down they know
[41:45.920 --> 41:49.440]  they can't target our sponsors because we don't really have sponsors the network does i really
[41:49.440 --> 41:54.320]  don't for all of these purposes we're pretty much supportive of the products we sell so what do they
[41:54.320 --> 42:00.560]  do well oh you might not get your iodine now but okay we're now looking for getting from brazil
[42:00.560 --> 42:03.920]  off the coast if we have to whatever we're gonna get the iodine and you got to get it into the
[42:03.920 --> 42:09.040]  country but they're behind the scenes and a lot of chicanery is going on uh and this is one of our
[42:09.040 --> 42:14.960]  best-selling products of course it's been targeted and it and and so yes um i'm told they have enough
[42:14.960 --> 42:20.160]  to run a certain amount we're about to sell out then we have one more big run and dr grip thinks
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.440]  we're not gonna have a problem it's just that we're gonna be charged more for it's a magical
[42:23.440 --> 42:28.080]  open price there's just a lot of issues uh going on here obviously because there's only two places
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.640]  in the u.s that and i can even say where because this is all proprietary secret stuff okay it's
[42:32.640 --> 42:38.320]  what we do we know we traffic in the key intel well this is the key intel so it funds their
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.160]  operation everything we're doing they're attacking us every front i'm actually proud of this but
[42:43.520 --> 42:46.880]  if you want to get your nason iodine um it's about to sell out
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.280]  info wars life dot com and four store dot com or triple a two five three three one three nine
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.560]  we've got one more big run we can do and i i i think we're gonna make it through this hurdle um
[42:56.560 --> 43:01.360]  it's just that you should know that i'm like what an incredible sales angle well let's turn
[43:01.360 --> 43:06.720]  lemons and eliminate here uh you know people are really gonna need this they're gonna enjoy it we're
[43:06.720 --> 43:10.720]  not going to raise the price in fact it's 30 off right now we're gonna do the opposite of what folks
[43:10.720 --> 43:14.880]  do we're gonna we're gonna you know just do it to the end and just i think if i treat the listeners
[43:14.880 --> 43:18.800]  right they'll treat us right and i think we'll be able to do this and i and i know what it is
[43:18.800 --> 43:23.200]  there's some big pharmaceutical companies that are getting into shampoo and things like that and
[43:23.200 --> 43:26.240]  some other things and you know it's just like they want to make fish oil illegal basically
[43:26.240 --> 43:29.600]  and make you get a prescription and then it really is great they just they just come in
[43:30.640 --> 43:34.400]  when i started pushing iodine six years ago nobody had was pushing in stores they got these
[43:34.400 --> 43:39.440]  crap versions everywhere this is it folks this is the real deal info wars life dot com info wars
[43:39.440 --> 43:50.560]  store dot com now dr. Jerome Corsi dr. Jerome Corsi is our guest and again dr. Jerome Corsi is a
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.160]  new york times number one bestseller three times and of course is a great investigative
[43:56.160 --> 43:59.920]  journalist and formerly worked in international banking has been friends with Donald Trump for
[43:59.920 --> 44:05.680]  more than 40 years and of course worked for the state department in other areas as well as a consultant
[44:05.680 --> 44:12.240]  and he has major sources inside the pentagon former and current i have one of the same sources
[44:12.240 --> 44:15.760]  instead of putting out the source we're putting on an email they're sharing that way we don't
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.120]  put the name on the general but i i think everybody should just go public at this point
[44:19.680 --> 44:25.280]  but i'm sure the general knows more than i do and i separately have connections and i'm able to
[44:25.280 --> 44:29.840]  communicate uh with some of those folks so i'll just stop right there but the enemy knows exactly
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.200]  who we're talking about so i don't know why we're hiding sources but it's still important to do i get
[44:33.200 --> 44:39.200]  it this is a big deal on flint this is punishment for the military not backing al qaeda and ices and
[44:39.200 --> 44:45.360]  obama's jihad and then we've also got the big news on roger stone we've got the big news on google

[45:00.720 --> 45:05.440]  it's dangerous to be the best they just try to hope to ignore us like our info two weeks ago
[45:06.320 --> 45:11.280]  with the documents on nsa spying on trump notice they never said those were fake those are all
[45:11.280 --> 45:15.920]  real numbers folks my private number my private office nobody ever knew about everything trump

[45:38.560 --> 45:42.880]  holding while i went through that plug uh but dr. coursey big things happening my friend thanks for
[45:42.880 --> 45:52.320]  joining us a great pleasure to be with you thank you um this article on flin we we have a email
[45:52.320 --> 46:00.640]  it's being circulated uh by top us military retired and uh essentially we've got all the points here
[46:00.640 --> 46:07.520]  exactly as they are in the memo uh the military is thinking that flin is being scapegoated by the
[46:07.520 --> 46:15.040]  democrats uh basically flin criticized the obama administration as not properly estimating or
[46:15.040 --> 46:22.480]  underestimating the isis threat of essentially not equipping the libyan militias you know basically
[46:22.480 --> 46:29.280]  not the libyan army but equipping the the terrorist militias that overthrew and murdered qaddafi
[46:29.920 --> 46:38.640]  uh a criticism here of uh flin was very critical of um obama and secretary of state clinton
[46:38.640 --> 46:45.520]  for not protecting ambassador stevens and our embassy personnel in libya uh then he's fired
[46:45.520 --> 46:51.520]  by james clapper with the support of uh john brennan and if you read this you can see what the
[46:51.520 --> 46:58.000]  u.s military thinks i mean they're they're basically saying uh that clapper did the dirty work for
[46:58.000 --> 47:06.720]  obama and had the buy-in by john brennan branded muslim here who according to one of his contract
[47:06.720 --> 47:16.560]  staff the worker bees the cia spies that that's brennan so flin um gets even he retires he backs
[47:16.560 --> 47:24.080]  trump and then he really one ups obama clapper and brennan when trump gets elected let's just
[47:24.080 --> 47:29.040]  back up though i mean you're just going off but the generals are putting on the email but let's go
[47:29.040 --> 47:36.880]  further flin went on al jazeera and said we were ordered to back al qaeda slash isis purposely by
[47:36.880 --> 47:42.400]  obama that's treason and he led the military saying no and our classic military does not get
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.080]  political we're on a banana boat republic the problem is the globalists are overthrowing the
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.160]  country so our military is now having to get involved because the country is in such dire
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.520]  straits and it is let's just say the u.s military that got the intel the american people that got
[47:55.520 --> 48:01.360]  trump elected and that is now standing against total globalist dictatorship in america let's just
[48:01.360 --> 48:06.000]  tell it like it is the u.s army is standing right in front of the globalist right now
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.480]  the final domino to fall that's the only reason we're still here well and uh the obama and you
[48:12.480 --> 48:21.360]  know all of the hillary people hate flin because flin dared to stand up to obama and clinton
[48:21.360 --> 48:28.400]  and expose to the american public that you know we were backing al qaeda affiliated terror terrorist
[48:28.400 --> 48:34.880]  in libya i've been writing about this for years i mean that it's it was a change of size what's
[48:34.880 --> 48:40.240]  to say along with colonel schaefer you broke it all five years ago you had to pee until
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.920]  on the ground you broke it all and you know now what's happening and the way the retired
[48:45.920 --> 48:54.640]  military in this circulating email are saying is that now the democrats the radical democrats
[48:54.640 --> 49:00.400]  and of course remember they're led now today by tom perez who is head of the dnc and he's
[49:00.400 --> 49:06.720]  la rosa and uh they've got keith ellison who is a muslim brotherhood these are the leaders of
[49:06.720 --> 49:11.360]  the democratic party right you won't be sworn in the bible yet so so bottom line they're planning
[49:11.360 --> 49:16.080]  a coup they're planning to make a run at the president they're openly saying you cog to overthrow him
[49:16.960 --> 49:23.280]  i don't have dreams of some war with these idiots i i want stability but we're going to the president's
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.920]  going to have to move on very quickly they're involved in sedition they're the outside threat
[49:27.920 --> 49:34.160]  they're the globalist you've got this uh this junkered air to the entire nazi system uh that
[49:34.160 --> 49:38.880]  owns luxembourg through fraud i mean he owns it because his parents invaded it i mean you can't
[49:38.880 --> 49:45.040]  make that up threatening to overthrow the united states i mean i'm done man and the generals are
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.400]  saying here in this that basically uh flinn is under so much attack from the democrats it's
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.960]  coordinated attack that's why i say they don't know who's shooting at him it is six o'clock
[49:54.960 --> 50:01.360]  you know the bandits unknowns they're all the democrats trying to take down flinn in order
[50:01.360 --> 50:07.680]  to de-legitimate the trump presidency that's what's going on here and that's why president trump
[50:07.680 --> 50:15.760]  today uh tweeted that trump you know he believes flinn should get um immunity in order to be able
[50:15.760 --> 50:20.880]  to testify and defend himself this is scapegoating it's what the democrats are doing they they can't
[50:20.880 --> 50:27.040]  stand the the radical left can't stand the u.s military that's yet defending the united states
[50:27.040 --> 50:33.600]  of america and flinn was part of that group so they're going to find any way they can to put him
[50:33.600 --> 50:39.600]  in prison to you know essentially over leaks remember all this they want to send a message
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.840]  they want to send a message that if you're loyal the united states of america you have
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.800]  courage like general flinn who who isn't the heir to the nazi fortune like yunkers who comes from
[50:48.800 --> 50:53.760]  you know persecuted irish people is a tough guy and a patriot and smarter than all these comebacks
[50:53.760 --> 50:59.040]  it's again elites trying to burn real americans and you couldn't have a more you know a serious
[50:59.040 --> 51:03.680]  dichotomy of yunkers threatening to overthrow america while our government run by criminals
[51:03.680 --> 51:10.880]  tries to put a patriot in prison and and the message here is that the elite the leftist elite
[51:11.520 --> 51:16.400]  are going to come after you when lawyers they're going to lawyer up they're going to come after
[51:16.400 --> 51:23.200]  you and try to destroy you whether it's you know fighting president obama in the courts on trying
[51:23.200 --> 51:26.960]  to let's just tell folks behind the scenes we're all getting the phone calls it's i mean and it's
[51:26.960 --> 51:31.120]  it's the biggest names it's real they're on a jihad and that's what i was told by a high
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.280]  level republican who is a good republican he said no it's happening everywhere behind the
[51:35.280 --> 51:39.840]  scenes now they're going on a jihad and then everybody just says let's man up let's go i mean
[51:39.840 --> 51:44.560]  we're going to double triple down let's go let's go well i think the clean case shows that again
[51:44.560 --> 51:52.480]  it's more confirmation that the the left is on a determined effort to shut down any conservative
[51:52.480 --> 51:57.760]  views they are not interested in the free period of first amendment the left wants to criminalize
[51:58.560 --> 52:04.480]  the alice jones show that's what this is about left by the way they're now officially saying that
[52:04.480 --> 52:10.800]  in a democratic party organs by name saying the president doesn't deserve to have a twitter alice
[52:10.800 --> 52:16.160]  jones must be shut down i mean they it's just out where's the instinct in the old left that had
[52:16.160 --> 52:21.600]  problems but but i i didn't hate right or left i was just an americana guy the instinct to defend
[52:21.600 --> 52:28.480]  free speech this is flaming authoritarianism and it's the it's the hard left democratic party is a
[52:28.480 --> 52:37.280]  hard left today of osala linsky this is bill ayer's carl marx this is radical ideologues of the far
[52:37.280 --> 52:44.160]  left who are not interested in anyone disagreeing with them they they want to have thought reform
[52:44.160 --> 52:50.480]  very much like in the you know chinese revolution exactly now the now is their main is all these
[52:50.480 --> 52:54.800]  college groups everything literature mal mal mal they see that as the only communist success
[52:54.800 --> 52:59.920]  yeah 80 million people dead they see that as their god it's they are trying to bring in a mal system
[53:00.880 --> 53:04.960]  and anyone who disagrees with them is going to be criminalized and that's why
[53:04.960 --> 53:10.800]  there's an attempt to call fake news i mean we've written about uh david brock of media
[53:10.800 --> 53:17.760]  matters who is funded by soros really putting on the father of the fake news so they can brand
[53:17.760 --> 53:23.760]  all news that that is conservative uh in a while during the election 20th century fox creates over
[53:23.760 --> 53:29.040]  a hundred fake news sites to attack trump might you all of us have been attacked trump obviously
[53:29.040 --> 53:33.120]  nine nine percent of it and then it's like oh it's still a big deal it was to promote a movie no it
[53:33.120 --> 53:38.480]  wasn't it was you know real looking newspaper saying trump hates mexicans blah blah blah
[53:38.480 --> 53:44.000]  and they're so crazy now like i said cobert will have me say i'm not anti-gay and they'll edit it
[53:44.000 --> 53:51.200]  it and then say i'm anti-gay i mean again it's next level deception what have they gone insane
[53:51.200 --> 53:56.720]  or is there a method of their madness dr corsey well the method is that it is the democratic party
[53:56.720 --> 54:02.720]  has become a leftist socialist democratic party communist party on the european model and they're
[54:02.720 --> 54:10.240]  happy to use soviet disinformation techniques in order to discredit their opponents and the left
[54:10.240 --> 54:14.880]  is running disinformation campaigns constantly every day oh yeah they've got one behind the
[54:14.880 --> 54:20.160]  scenes where they send letters supposedly written by me to people threatening them and saying horrible
[54:20.160 --> 54:24.960]  things and then i have to like call these probably go no that i didn't send that i just it's it's
[54:24.960 --> 54:31.200]  unbelievable and they the and the next thing is it's i'm pointing out google facebook they're
[54:31.200 --> 54:38.320]  all into this i you're gonna find the californians introduced a law now to criminalize anyone who
[54:38.320 --> 54:44.240]  does fake news on the internet well who's to determine what's fake news it's going to be california
[54:44.240 --> 54:50.720]  criminalizing the alex jones show me anyone else who dares to i have a conservative point of view
[54:50.720 --> 54:56.720]  and point out your truthful position from a conservative or my conservative free private
[54:56.720 --> 55:01.840]  property right to religion right to not practice religion right to travel all the basic americana
[55:01.840 --> 55:06.960]  things which were the most liberal thing ever compared to the old tyranny so we are the classical
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.400]  liberals even political scientists call paleo conservatives classical liberals so now we have
[55:12.400 --> 55:20.080]  these conned masses of people that think they're part of the power structure serving modern liberalism
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.200]  when they're serving the most vicious evil imaginable yes and i'm pointing out in the
[55:25.200 --> 55:31.120]  other article i wrote today in terms of what's going on with google that you know the truth is
[55:31.120 --> 55:39.200]  is everyone's all upset oh so the the g.o.p ruled down our internet privacy now that's not what the
[55:39.200 --> 55:48.560]  vote was about the vote was about returning the regulation of the internet to the f t c remember
[55:48.560 --> 55:54.240]  it was obama who wanted to have this was google for wanting to have the internet defined as broadband
[55:54.240 --> 56:01.040]  under title two of the communications act so that they couldn't act rules on net neutrality
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.000]  and by the way these are no more disinformation for the left net neutrality doesn't mean that neutrality
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.840]  it means more power to google facebook and the other major players and then the internet privacy
[56:11.840 --> 56:18.880]  rules the fcc which again are not internet privacy rules google onto these rules if you read the rules
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.600]  was able to continue to collect data on individuals mine itself i'm glad you raised this because
[56:25.600 --> 56:29.840]  speaking of david brogd and their sight doesn't get a lot of traffic but it literally is the admitted
[56:29.840 --> 56:35.120]  talking points that came out wiki leaks of msm from the democrats from george soros so it's like
[56:35.120 --> 56:41.360]  george soros's notepad they said i'm a liar because i reported on your article that that they're not
[56:41.360 --> 56:46.000]  really the republicans really didn't pass something to allow all your browser data to be shared and
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.200]  then i went research the other thing they said last year was they were claiming oh uh trump's
[56:51.200 --> 56:56.400]  going to end net neutrality no obama called it net neutrality to bring fcc and federal elections
[56:56.400 --> 57:01.760]  commission total control over the web saying they were going to shut drudge down that was the main
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.160]  group you know for every hundred articles they'd mentioned we us once as well so saying they want
[57:06.160 --> 57:12.400]  to shut us down too uh so it's just crazy they admit this so so navigate folks briefly or in
[57:12.400 --> 57:19.760]  the next segment into how that's a deception well it's a deception because the basic what president
[57:19.760 --> 57:27.040]  trump is trying to do is to get the regulation of the internet out of the fcc it's not a common
[57:27.040 --> 57:33.360]  carrier it's not going to be regulated like you know the the fairness rule over radio which is
[57:33.360 --> 57:40.480]  where the democrats and google were headed and these rules are written always so google facebook
[57:40.480 --> 57:46.880]  all the big giants don't have to follow what the isps and the smaller players in the internet
[57:46.880 --> 57:54.720]  are are blocked from doing so president trump said look we're going to turn back all these
[57:54.720 --> 58:00.800]  obama google regulations on the fcc we're going to take regulations out of the hands of the
[58:00.800 --> 58:07.200]  fcc for the internet put it back in the hands of the ftc where the rules to protect privacy
[58:07.200 --> 58:13.280]  are actually much greater and historically that's where privacy has been protected now
[58:13.280 --> 58:20.080]  where this google does behind the scenes google now angles to get a candidate that google thinks
[58:20.080 --> 58:24.320]  will be fair to google in other words exactly there well let's come back at 70 seconds here's the
[58:24.320 --> 58:29.200]  deal everything's being shared they're all sharing it they're all giving it to the nsa and back and
[58:29.200 --> 58:35.440]  forth it's all and then they turn around and say that the house republicans are taking your rides
[58:35.440 --> 58:40.800]  away it just it's it's it's ridiculous when google's constantly lobbying to flush your
[58:40.800 --> 58:46.160]  privacy down a commode immediately and they're all working with communist china and the muslims now
[58:46.160 --> 58:50.240]  to arrest people to criticize islam so they can be killed in pakistan not a group you developed
[58:50.240 --> 58:55.200]  living defense for us it took you over a year to do it why is this so good because people are actually
[58:55.200 --> 59:01.280]  waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most i mean i try to make sure that i don't
[59:01.280 --> 59:07.280]  put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system but right now we're dealing with massive
[59:07.280 --> 59:12.800]  parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now
[59:12.800 --> 59:18.800]  with all the refugees uh spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere
[59:18.800 --> 59:22.560]  these are all parasites tell us about all the stuff that there's so many things that are in it
[59:22.560 --> 59:27.920]  you have the neem in there you have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood i recommend doing
[59:27.920 --> 59:32.240]  the parasite cleanse at least twice a year all right well i'm glad we've got some back in because
[59:32.240 --> 59:36.400]  i'm going back on it today it just came back in yesterday living defense info wars life dot com
[59:36.400 --> 59:41.520]  and folks you can't lose it's full of stuff that's great for your body period and uh you support the
[59:41.520 --> 59:46.080]  broadcast info wars lives dot com thank you doctor group from the global healing center thank you so
[59:46.080 --> 1:00:06.080]  much for all your work sir on this great product you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:16.080]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:00:17.760 --> 1:00:24.480]  all right doctor in course is our guest we have a retired navy seal patriot
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:33.200]  joining us uh there are a lot of military groups activity contractors you name it that are aware
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.600]  of the globalist child trafficking um when they when they even try to speak out against
[1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:43.920]  that they're getting blocked on the internet or things are happening to them and their families
[1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:50.400]  but that's that's making them only get even more aggressive now so there's just a total war going on
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:55.760]  i can't even believe at this point i'll be honest i just feel guilty constantly that i'm not doing
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:00.960]  enough i'm serious i just there's so many good people in this world there's so many good people
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:08.080]  in america but there's also just so many asleep people and they just empower predators to do horrible
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:17.040]  horrible things and not of course we got four minutes left i appreciate your tireless work three
[1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:22.640]  four articles a day and you guys are so prolific you and kit daniels and don salazar and you know
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.320]  all the rest of the great crew in there folks i can't even mention all the great riders like
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:30.960]  paul watson and of course rachel taylor and everybody else i i need to mention them all i
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:36.960]  mentioned any of them so many great people but um to be living in such incredible history
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.160]  you know i'm gonna hold you a little bit we have a guest come up he can wait five minutes he's great
[1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:44.800]  but because i'm gonna have a little more time on this but just just just getting into this
[1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:50.800]  google wants its own puppet the ftc chair to block any trust action then they turn around and act like
[1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:55.680]  the republicans in the house are trying to take your privacy with them when these people
[1:01:55.680 --> 1:02:00.800]  literally gutted it and danced in our ashes and then i have to go actually read bills myself and
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:05.680]  it's very nuanced i gotta call you know communications lawyers high level ones they confirm what you
[1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:10.000]  told me yesterday because you said it i read your article i believed you then people said i was a liar
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.080]  tried to make phone calls yesterday you know and other ones and it's just they're like you know
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.600]  that's dead on and so i just i get why the public's uninformed because this stuff is so complex i do
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:26.640]  this for a living and i can't keep track of it i mean what do we do well see the key here alexand
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:31.200]  understanding what the democrats want to do they want to get the regulations of the internet and
[1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:36.480]  the fcc put it under title two of the communications act so they have a great reason why they want it
[1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:43.440]  but what it means is control and what it means is that all these rules internet neutrality internet
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:51.680]  privacy it were designed in the fcc to treat the internet service providers the isps differently
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:57.600]  than the edge providers the big players like google and facebook so the isp and most people don't
[1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:03.360]  they're technical issues but and the democrats know that most people don't understand these issues
[1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:10.720]  so they're using disinformation what the fcc privacy rule did was it basically didn't prevent
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:18.160]  google and facebook from collecting and using your data on the internet what you click facebook
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:24.240]  google could even if you're not even on a google site you're on some other site google tracks you
[1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:30.960]  and can record as long as you're using the google web browser it can track everything google pled guilty
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.760]  to having thousands of cars drive around with key software hacking in and stealing your damn passcodes
[1:03:35.760 --> 1:03:42.480]  i mean ah and so under this internet privacy google could continue to do that but the internet
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:48.880]  service providers had to ask your permission now the internet service providers don't typically
[1:03:48.880 --> 1:03:55.280]  have your user data they they they tie you into the internet and then where you go is not traced
[1:03:55.280 --> 1:04:04.000]  by the isps so the law the privacy rule was written to sound like uh no one was going to be able to
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:10.400]  use your browsing data unless you permitted it but that's not what the rule said the rule applied
[1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:16.640]  that to the isps it didn't apply it to the edge providers like google and facebook and this point
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:22.640]  was made yesterday by shawn spicer and the white house briefing who said basically and by the way
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:26.800]  i totally get stuff wrong sometimes and i noticed drudge was kind of going with this because that's
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.560]  the headlines and the wash and post and there are times i noticed you know that suddenly drudge pulled
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:35.680]  that so i mean i was i i was really questioning you and others as well but i was spicer came out
[1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:41.120]  and corrected that so and and and again anything can be done via regulation the way they project it
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:45.120]  it's just that we really saw this happen with the whole net neutrality deal where they call it net
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:50.720]  neutrality it's at the end of the day i'm free internet and then and and yeah the clue to picking
[1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:55.440]  this up and well what i'm we're started writing i'm gonna do more next week well come back and
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:59.600]  finish up if you can doc the home doctor course and then we've got our special guest hey this is

[1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:54.640]  to concerns that they were becoming radicalized according to the report at least one had access

[1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:33.200]  you know we had craig soyer on a few weeks ago and obviously he can't get into any of the classified
[1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.720]  stuff he did in won't even say the name of the most elite seal team that he was in and also
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:43.360]  was a leader and we'll just leave it at that uh not a lot of folks in the military a lot of war
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:49.520]  heroes a lot of guys gel to force navy seals army rangers you name it and they you know say craig's
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:54.080]  craig's one of the you know greatest out there but he's a very humble guy but behind the scenes uh
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:59.200]  talking to people that are involved internationally and in different countries they talk about all
[1:08:59.200 --> 1:09:04.000]  the child sex trafficking that that comes out in the news and it's being done by large defense
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:08.320]  contractor multinationals and then you have the military they're seeing it happening over the
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:13.200]  decades this has been all their bbc ap Reuters and the media just hopes you don't look at that just
[1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:22.240]  like there was 474 rest last month you know in um they're in la alone with 28 kids and like dungeons
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:28.880]  and cages never saw the news again and then when these guys start trying to even speak out against
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:35.840]  it privately then stuff starts happening and i don't know how much of this i can get into but
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:41.840]  i've personally experienced it as well i've always exposed the globalists in their pension to use
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:48.000]  child sex crime to blackmail and control people it's well known that england's almost the capital
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:52.800]  of this or maybe luxembourg places like that i mean this is what this is kind of your entry card
[1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:57.360]  into wahhabism i guess that's why the british intelligence put the wahhabist in control
[1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:02.400]  in syria because that's just part of their religions pedophilia in that particular form of
[1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:07.920]  islam that is now the dominant form by the way syria runs sunni islam is trying to turn it over
[1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:14.640]  to this new really sickening thing that was like the operating system of people that rob caravans
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:21.040]  so they took the caran and kind of adopted it into caravan robbing and sex slave so that's kind of
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:26.000]  who runs islam today is sex laborers uh who were just a few hundred i'm running around the desert
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:31.600]  now they run everything and you know buying hollywood china you name it but i wanted to ask
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:35.520]  dr corse just in closing we just got this breaking news who knows if it's true because in nbc and
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:39.760]  them lie so much but michael flin's immunity request rejected by senate intelligence committee
[1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:45.280]  two congressional sources and i just this is being handled so so bad and that's why you've
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:49.040]  had some of the top generals come out in the articles on m4's and say this is because he stood
[1:10:49.040 --> 1:10:55.120]  up against obama selling us out to radical islam and the whole big islamic jihad they got launched
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:01.840]  five years ago that's seeing it and all of them backed because if you look at this
[1:11:03.440 --> 1:11:07.920]  flin knows that they're going to go after him for some turkey lobbying and i knew about this
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:13.680]  a year ago i was already hearing about stuff going on in turkey and flin and things trying to work
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:19.280]  for this country but paperwork things like that it was seen by lawyers when he's brought on as the
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:23.760]  national security advisor it's not that big a deal kind of not down i don't cross the t okay whatever
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:28.640]  because that was domestic lobbying that trump didn't want to you know anybody of all this was
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:36.720]  military stuff going on and it was all very moral but you see they put it out there like oh for the
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:44.240]  russia stuff no they they they're threatening to put flin under the jail for other exaggerated
[1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:49.760]  made-up stuff if he doesn't roll over and all this while the democrats are knee deep in russians
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:56.560]  and podesta we broke it a month ago it's all over the news now massive amounts of russian stock
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:02.400]  russian uranium transfers hillary servers the chinese communist runners so i want to just put a
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:06.880]  bookend on this with dr. germ corsie about where we are historically because people say oh he's the
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:11.200]  president let's be confident let's move forward with his agenda he's got the neocons he's got the
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:16.800]  rhinos after him he's got the democrats he's got the eu meddling again saying we're gonna overthrow
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:21.440]  your country i mean why wouldn't all americans rally behind the president if he hadn't put up the
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:26.480]  stock market what moving to cut taxes hadn't got the best small business numbers since 1984 hadn't
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:32.240]  got 300 billion of investment announcements coming here wasn't obviously americana as it gets then i
[1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:37.200]  wouldn't be worried about defending trump but he they're pissed because they're not selling america
[1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:40.880]  out anymore doesn't mean he'll execute stuff perfectly i'm surprised he'd get anything done at
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.680]  this point uh they call it a big failure it took him years to pass obama care in 60-something days
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:50.160]  he fails to get rid of it the first time so it's a big failure so so just putting bookends on the
[1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:53.280]  stock of course and we're gonna our other guests i appreciate your time and all the big breaking
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:58.240]  news info wars dot com that they just don't even counter your articles now they just totally ignore
[1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:01.600]  them that's why it's up to the audience to get these out then you see other publications
[1:13:01.600 --> 1:13:05.520]  reporting on it months later again because we really are the fount of so much of the resistance
[1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:09.200]  i don't say that on a power trip it's actually scary i don't actually want to keep being the
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:13.440]  folks that break you know half of the key intel but that's a dangerous position to be in
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:20.240]  so just just just bookends on where we are historically well this is going to be now
[1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:26.880]  guerrilla warfare from the democrats the democrats are playing a solowinsky game disinformation
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:33.040]  constant disinformation uh lawyered up threatening to sue everything tie up every action distorting
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:39.600]  every story no matter how nunas went over to the white house or got the information which by the
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:46.400]  way the substance that information shows that uh trump was under electronic surveillance and
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:51.120]  his key people certainly in the transition period and notice as soon as we're proven right they just
[1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:58.000]  stop saying trumps crazy and they change the story it's all disinformation no matter what trump does
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  no matter what we do we're fake news we're going to be attacked by lawyers it's going to be disinformation
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.440]  and smear campaigns but last point i really want to make here is that you know where i got what
[1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:14.480]  want people to get into this idea of the fake news that it's the gop who's against internet
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:20.880]  privacy is i've been publishing and started to publish that george soros has put 72 million dollars
[1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:28.160]  with his open society institute of the ford foundation since 2006 into this net neutrality
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:35.280]  issue into getting the regulation of the internet under the fcc that was the whole thing and so if
[1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:41.520]  the left is the one who's trying to portray that the gop is against internet privacy where what
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:50.800]  soros and google wanted were rules for instance in the fcc on internet privacy where google
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:55.360]  could collect all the data it wants just still does well even if you're down on the google site
[1:14:55.360 --> 1:15:01.200]  anywhere you go on the internet but the isps by the way this isn't your opinion we have thousands
[1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:08.480]  of pages of wiki leaks of him saying when the un takes over the internet i want it to shut down
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:14.400]  all the nationalist media drugs report info wars he says i want them shut down and only my news
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:22.720]  pushed i mean good god but i really understand that c the fcc rules on internet privacy were
[1:15:22.720 --> 1:15:29.520]  written not to block google from collecting all the user data they had it they was designed so
[1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:38.080]  that the isps had to ask permission to collect it well the isps are small players who'd never had
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:44.480]  your user data your click data anyway they just connected you to the internet so google wrote the
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:51.200]  privacy rule so that they could violate your pop your privacy at will and have a quasi monopoly
[1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:57.760]  on it and then did anybody who objected to this they could say you're against internet privacy
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:03.200]  which is what they did to the gop trump is moving it back regulation of the internet back into the
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:10.480]  ftc the ftc has much more robust rules to protect consumer privacy and under these google is going
[1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:17.120]  to have to bear the price of giving up its data searching everybody's history and google knows
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:24.320]  it it's why google is trying to pick a ftc cherubin who is going to be favorable to the google
[1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:30.800]  and not do an antitrust action because he google understands the difference between the fcc and
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:36.880]  the ftc and trump understands it too and trump's going to get the internet back into the control
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:44.320]  of the ftc where it belongs so these screwy google favorable rules financed by soros with millions
[1:16:44.320 --> 1:16:51.040]  of dollars and lying disinformation can't be promulgated on the american people as disinformation
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:56.320]  attacking the gop what's the gop who's trying to protect privacy that's the truth that's the
[1:16:56.320 --> 1:17:00.080]  total inversion of reality that there's such masters of i come out and say george soros
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:05.760]  is a horrible nazi collaborator and is a mafia head feeding on jewish people which is an admitted
[1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:11.840]  fact he admitted to on 60 minutes and they say oh jones is anti-semitic it's a total inversion i
[1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:15.840]  don't want to destroy israel george soros is in the wiki league saying he wants to get rid of israel
[1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:21.760]  so the adl gives him awards what is going on at the adl well again it's you've got all these
[1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:28.800]  leftist organizations we're ideologically driven so if you're for instance you know google and you're
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:34.480]  you're offering to give all this data you've got in everybody's search habits to hillary clinton to
[1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:40.160]  be your main advisor for her you know get out the vote in her donor list which eric schmidt offered
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:46.480]  to do it's in the wiki leaks documents fedesta emails then anything you want to do is okay
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:52.640]  because the left decides you're you're with us you're google you hate conservatives you hate
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:58.640]  america you hate the constitution so you get a pass and that's the way the ideological left
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:05.680]  plays is the same way the communist played in the cultural revolution in china in the 60s and if you
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:10.000]  disagree with them you're either going to be criminalized or you go to thought reform school
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:15.520]  because your views as a conservative or libertarian are not going to be tolerated here's the deal that
[1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:19.360]  came out in the weatherman trial and of course we had the great green beret that infiltrated them
[1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:23.280]  and exposed they were there they said we're going to malice camps we're going to put 50 million
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:28.640]  americans in we're going to kill half of them and he's in the meeting with phd's from columbia harvard
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:33.840]  coldly talking about how they're going to murder us and i just want all these guys to know alex by
[1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:40.320]  the way that work came out i did i was going in the 60s i was working on contracts at universities
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:46.560]  with the ad clearances and i was part of it infiltrating getting the information out of the
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:50.720]  vietnam veterans against the wall i know i know you've done a lot of secret stuff and you never
[1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:54.480]  you never talk about it on air so when do you want to talk about all the stuff we got that
[1:18:54.480 --> 1:19:01.120]  information from attending vietnam veterans against the war meetings and recording them
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:06.240]  and that that that information we put out when i wrote co-authored with john o'neill unfit for
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:11.200]  command we showed in detail of the vietnam veterans against the war working with the
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:14.960]  communist chinese now i know you were part of that but i want to get into all the other other stuff
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:20.480]  because it's just uh it had one of those moments who was the great guy that he died a few years
[1:19:20.480 --> 1:19:24.480]  ago that we've had on so many times who was the guy that was in the meetings and testify what was
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:29.520]  his name oh i know there was a lot of what was against a guy named hubbard i'd have to pull
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:35.520]  down the uh book unfit for command remember his name but there was uh we was one of the guys who
[1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:40.960]  infiltrated well the point is i go out to the to their events and we sent people to the local
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:47.440]  communist events as well and they're like the police review boards you name it we're they're not even
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:53.760]  hiding it they're like at ut uh lecture halls openly how they're going to take over it and and and
[1:19:53.760 --> 1:19:59.440]  tell us and stuff i mean i'm like i just as a man i don't know why i'm not calling for violence i
[1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:03.120]  did a certain point though how do we just sit here and put up with this thank you so much
[1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:09.920]  dr. Jerome coursey god bless you thank you all right i appreciate uh our next guest uh patiently
[1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:14.640]  holding the last 15 minutes i ran over earlier they'll be with us a little bit in the next hour
[1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:20.800]  then leon macken is going to be joining us in studio and david night craig soyer uh again i already
[1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:26.800]  knew craig soyer was and then of course i have some friends that um worked as contractors in other
[1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:32.080]  clandestine areas obviously the cia and things uh overseas and they said no craig's a really great
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:36.480]  guy he knows exactly what's going on and also he's a listener of yours uh and of course he told the
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:41.360]  story last time he was on about the cia guy years ago in country and see her operation saying he
[1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:44.800]  want to know what's going on here listen to this well wish i'm always honored to hear and i've
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:48.560]  been told that story quite a few times about a lot of folks but that's just as we have all these
[1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:52.160]  guys on over the years and and people i mean i remember used to have the chairman of the joint
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:57.840]  chiefs of staff uh adriel morrow on i used to have uh the former head of the air force uh
[1:20:57.840 --> 1:21:02.240]  bet and t part and i mean i've just had hundreds and hundreds of these great people many of which
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:07.680]  aren't with us unfortunately anymore and a lot more behind the scenes we talked to so it's not like i
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:11.600]  came up with any of this i've done my research and i've got the sources and we're willing to
[1:21:11.600 --> 1:21:16.960]  put it out but i haven't pre-interviewed craig for the second time we went we went out and had
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:22.400]  dinner and stuff before i ever had him on there i never talked to him before um but obviously a
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:26.400]  lot of the stuff he seems classified i talked to a lot of other folks it's come out in the news you
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:31.840]  can just search engine uh u n caught running child sex slaves or big corporations doing it and the
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:36.720]  military sees this then tries to blow the whistle but then even when they don't even do it publicly
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:40.800]  all the sudden they start getting shut down on the internet on their social networks if you do it
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:44.400]  then they really shut you down he's been through that we're gonna talk about it today and of course
[1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:51.120]  craig's the type of guy that i'm guessing so i want you to come on let's go on the offense uh since
[1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:54.880]  they're trying to shut us down openly that's what i announced last week that's what he's saying he's
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:58.800]  doing i bet he didn't even hear the show we're just all on the same page and i can't get into a lot
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:03.040]  of it because it's it's quite frankly the media would run crazy with it and it sounds unbelievable
[1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:08.160]  because that's how truth is stranger than fiction uh but tacticalinsider.com is his website
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:14.480]  craig our uh sawman Sawyer is a marine veteran former navy seal sniper and combat instructor
[1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:18.960]  he's the owner of tactical insider which brings tactical advanced weapons and combat to hollywood
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:25.440]  films and actors and i'm not going to go through his whole bio and the rest of it but um he he's
[1:22:25.440 --> 1:22:29.600]  joining us here here on here i know off record i've talked to some of his folks he was with
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:34.240]  some of the crazy stories and things they've seen uh but the reason he's here is i don't know how
[1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:40.240]  far he can go into this but sex crimes in america are just exploding and the feminists all say it's
[1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:44.960]  western culture no it's not it's islamic culture it's third world culture that are admittedly
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:52.080]  more more more uh readily uh accepting this and it's getting crazy and crazier where our
[1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:56.800]  militaries told let the muslims rape children it's their culture well now in europe they're saying that
[1:22:56.800 --> 1:23:02.720]  and then i don't know how far he can go into things but uh you know this stuff really hits close
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:08.000]  to home for everybody and if it hasn't burned you yet or people you know then just wait it's
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:13.680]  gonna happen and so it's like evil's coming out of the nest it's coming out of the cave it's it's
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:18.320]  like the devil walking around roaring seeing who he made of our and so none of us have all the
[1:23:18.320 --> 1:23:21.440]  answers i don't know exactly what to do i just know i'm gonna get the word out move forward we're
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:27.520]  going to beat these people but um we're dealing with very very very very wicked people trump has
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:32.960]  arrested it was 1800 a few weeks ago it's over 3000 uh alleged pedophiles but a lot of times it's
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:38.000]  not child porn it's with the kids in cages okay and the big telltale sign is like california on
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:46.080]  february 2nd ktla biggest tv station l a 424 arrested 28 kids in bondage some of them in cages
[1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:50.560]  nothing about the kids nothing about where they are now nothing about what was going on this network
[1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:56.800]  and i've seen this type of article thousands of times over the years and so this is the real
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:01.440]  currency of the global so i don't know where we're even going here today other than a brainstorm
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:06.720]  session about what we can do and i know a lot separately uh people are sick of this in the
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:10.800]  military they're tired of the islamic takeover the globalist takeover the head of the uu threatening
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:15.280]  to break the united states up yesterday when he's the leading nazi heir yunker even you can't make
[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:19.680]  this up the basically the nazis took luxembourg he rules it now and he's the head of the uu it's
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:26.880]  like some royal weasel on an unelected uu thing so so i'm ranting the point is is that they want us
[1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:32.080]  to shut up about pedophilia they want us to shut up about what's going on and look we're just
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:36.560]  investigating sometimes we're right sometimes we're wrong we're correct when we are the point is is that
[1:24:38.080 --> 1:24:42.240]  why is there the demonization why is salon saying pedophilia is no big deal why is the
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:46.000]  un trying to legalize it's saying it's just a sexual preference why are they trying to lower
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.480]  the age of consent for kids all over the world what is going on why are they allowed to guess
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:55.760]  we had yesterday thousands of girls being raped and everything by muslims and the police say it's
[1:24:55.760 --> 1:25:01.280]  okay it's their culture in england that's mainstream news so what's happening here why and now we see
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:06.480]  orthodox radical obvious islam pedophilia's attendants in the korean merging with these
[1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:12.000]  pedophile networks so again i haven't talked to the sawman since way by two when i walked out of
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.400]  the steakhouse a few weeks ago here in austin every did a great job on the show tacticalinsider.com
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:20.960]  but i'm he's a polite guys he'll pause a lot so just take over tell folks about your idea i know
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:25.520]  other people are launching similar ideas already have i know special lots people that are currently
[1:25:25.520 --> 1:25:29.840]  actually doing raids all over the world saving people out of sex slavery we probably can't get
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:34.880]  into that because uh it's it's obviously being funded by some patriots and who knows the government
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:39.040]  even knows it's going on but the point is craig you're gonna know more about the stuff than i do so
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:43.040]  i don't know how much we can talk about but you've got the floor thanks for joining us yeah no thanks
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:50.480]  for having me on alex well in in short i am inclined to go public with this because this whole
[1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:55.680]  pedophile business has been really suppressed by the media i know people that have done good
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:26:04.400]  investigations been part of the great uh roundups and and uh networks of arrests in this field and
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:09.440]  they just say man it just doesn't hit the light of day it just goes away because there is so much
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:14.160]  influence a lot of these pedophiles are very connected they're very wealthy and they own a
[1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:21.200]  lot of the media and uh things just get swept under the rug and i have decided to go independent
[1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:26.480]  we were supposed to have a television series to kind of show this two years ago and it keeps
[1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:32.960]  not happening because uh those involved in the media apparently uh don't want to still see this
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:40.800]  come to life so my heart breaks when i imagine uh the the visual of what i'm learning from my friends
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:47.600]  that are deep into these investigations and saying you know craig this is turning out they're revealing
[1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:52.320]  itself to be the front lines between good and evil and the united states this is really kind of what
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:59.280]  my friends are seeing as the the front lines of the fight for the soul of our nation because it's
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:03.920]  so sick and so depraved what they're learning with these arrests in the bus and what they're finding
[1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:12.480]  it's it's hard for us to believe as decent you know morally decent citizens what's going on and
[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:16.880]  well i don't mean to interrupt you after my ten minute intro i should also add you're also a
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:21.040]  veteran federal law enforcement officer and we probably can't even get into all those classified
[1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:25.840]  areas have been involved in so you have federal law enforcement connections you have also obviously
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:30.320]  in the cia navy seals everything you've been in at all of it and so the point is you this is what
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:34.080]  you're getting back from everybody and we see it in the news three thousand plus reported pedophiles
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:39.600]  arrested many times with the sex slaves and then it goes totally dark that that shows total proof
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:45.520]  the total control yeah absolutely it's being suppressed and that's where i think the fight
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:51.360]  really is is in in shining the light on it i always say sunlight is the best antiseptic for
[1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:55.920]  corruption and that is exactly what's needed here that's what the doctor ordered that's what i feel
[1:27:55.920 --> 1:28:02.480]  like i can do with my background and my connections man i've got a team with uh senior veterans from
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.800]  virtually every intelligence and law enforcement agency out there as well as the highest end of
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:15.600]  counterterrorism for for operators so we can do a lot of good with this and it's really all about
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:19.840]  for for our organization and we're gonna launch when we come back from break i want to drumbeat
[1:28:19.840 --> 1:28:24.880]  you're launching a new national organization uh this is gonna really scare the scumbags and but
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:29.600]  i want you to really take your time we come back walk through everybody having this come to jesus
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:34.960]  moment and just seeing it and like you said the fight for the soul of the of the world not just
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:40.000]  america this is really going on it's a pedophile empire is how it was described to me by a senior
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  retired general and and they just say this is the one thing you touch they come after you well you
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:50.640]  know what it's time to say fill your hand didn't it yeah man it is it is it is i can't look away
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:54.320]  alex now there there are a lot of things i'd rather spend my time doing then i'd rather be
[1:28:55.120 --> 1:29:00.880]  you know um at the beats with those that i care about or doing anything else recreational but i
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:05.920]  with my background i feel like i have the ability to make a positive difference in my heart breaks
[1:29:05.920 --> 1:29:11.840]  for these children and i cannot look away and i will do what i can i think my best impact is to
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:17.040]  expose it so that we can clean it up let me launch it right now everybody needs to tweet it facebook it
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:20.000]  you the reason you're doing this again we talked about this probably last week but we're gonna
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:23.840]  get more into when we come back if we haven't talked much since then or haven't talked since then
[1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:28.160]  you were just saying i gotta do something i want to do something and we're gonna talk about when
[1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:34.160]  we come back but it's vets4childrescue.org and just since he was sort of talking about it privately
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:39.280]  they shut off his twitter facebook you name it won't let him spread anything because again folks
[1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:43.520]  everything's prevailed by these people that's what's so scared is we got a pedophile network in
[1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:51.280]  control basically the NSA we'll be back stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:54.960]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:59.280 --> 1:30:05.680]  the mainstream media was added again pushing a fake news hoax that trump's former national security
[1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:12.560]  advisor michael flinn offered to testify before congress in exchange for immunity this hoax was
[1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:19.840]  debunked shortly after twitter users began posting the actual letter which stated no reasonable person
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:26.400]  who has the benefit of advice from counsel would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:33.600]  witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution so its protection from unfair
[1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:40.400]  prosecution not immunity to state wrongfully that flinn is seeking immunity in exchange for
[1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:47.360]  his testimony is a way for the divisive mainstream media to imply that flinn is guilty to ask for
[1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:54.800]  protection against unfair prosecution is completely reasonable and doesn't imply guilt for more reports
[1:30:54.800 --> 1:31:00.960]  go to info wars dot com this is millie weaver reporting it's not just our water we need to filter
[1:31:00.960 --> 1:31:05.440]  it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially for our
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:11.440]  children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune
[1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:17.040]  systems the same team based right here in america that brought you the alexa pure groundbreaking
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:22.640]  water filtration systems have now developed alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office you
[1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:28.000]  owe it to yourself your co-workers your family your children do the best job you can to purify
[1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:33.200]  your air the elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that
[1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:39.440]  mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves the general public doesn't the alexa
[1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:43.760]  pure breeze would be a steal at three hundred four hundred five hundred dollars one of these systems
[1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:48.160]  can keep eight hundred square feet incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally putting in
[1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:53.760]  throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job find out why
[1:31:53.760 --> 1:32:01.440]  this system is so revolutionary today then fourwarstore.com we're selling a product dna force that is
[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:07.680]  the very best nutraceutical that we can produce about a group you took years for you to develop
[1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:12.320]  dna force for us it's been something that i've been working on for a long time alex because i
[1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:18.560]  think it's very very important what the aging process is is when the cell replicates we lose
[1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:24.240]  a little bit of our telomeres telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes but when
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:30.320]  it runs out you start dying we chose a pqq because it has over 175 different clinical trials it's one
[1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:36.560]  of the most effective substances in the world it works like an antioxidant it works to repair nerve

[1:32:55.040 --> 1:33:08.720]  our call toll free 888 253 3139 defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex
[1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:14.960]  jones uh i'm gonna come back and and i want him to start at the beginning and just lay it out as
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:22.400]  much as he wants to tell you but i was told trump's going after the pedophiles when he got in
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:26.080]  number something we mentioned on there but it's like wow that's an interesting campaign
[1:33:26.080 --> 1:33:31.360]  promised to people behind the scenes the military and and other folks that i talked to and then you
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:35.360]  see his tweets from years ago saying you know we just kill these people when they get convicted i
[1:33:35.360 --> 1:33:40.000]  want them executed because he's in new york he knows about the elites and it's just trump just
[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:45.760]  other people that own him 50 years not just like roger 40 he hates people that abuse children
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:53.280]  and and and trump is it just he's a neat freak a lot of the things you may he just can't stand
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:59.120]  pedophiles and so trump just says roll him up because law enforcement gets persecuted people go
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:06.720]  after him stuff happens to their families and trump's just say he's told the agencies everybody
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:11.600]  roll him up and that's why trump looks a little more serious when you even see him now it's not
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:17.200]  the old happy trump because he now knows way more than he did before vets for child rescue.org we're
[1:34:17.200 --> 1:34:22.000]  talking about launching this other groups are doing this behind the scenes you're seeing i mean the
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:27.120]  number is over 3 000 now arrested in just 16 nine days that trump's been in and and it's not the
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:32.160]  old-fashioned just some child porn it's people with four-year-olds with two-year-olds in cages it's
[1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:38.080]  it's legislators it's it's judges it's high-powered people it's bad folks and i want to be clear i'm
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:42.720]  not saying most judges are involved in this or you find it though because they've got controllers
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:47.840]  in key positions and they're trying to take our system over that's why they're doing that you
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:52.560]  can see in the news their agenda and their publications even promoting it like pedophilia
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:58.240]  is okay they're gonna take that aside and say that that's salon magazine uh you know all this other
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:03.840]  crap uh oh you know let me have access to this and that so we're gonna go back to crager in a moment
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:10.400]  just see just so you know and i'm not complaining this is my job quite frankly it's it's not gallo
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:16.160]  humor it's it's it's more than that i know when they're nationally saying shut off my advertisers
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:23.040]  kick me off google kick me off head roll shut me down arrest me gack it's in the news that i must
[1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:26.160]  be really hurting these people and boy when i go into the pedophile stuff they just go completely
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:32.560]  insane so i realized but you need to know though kind of like the alamos said in a letter out hey
[1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:37.760]  we're here we're gonna stay at the end they are chopping our tentacles off art you know the the
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:42.320]  different legs of our stool here all the time we and we're growing other ones fast we're moving
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:46.880]  forward and we it feels good we're in a war though this is an information war with people out there
[1:35:46.880 --> 1:35:50.960]  actually have to deal with it on the ground like these law enforcement people and military veterans
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.960]  have to go in and see the kids in the cages okay okay okay okay because i won't even in these
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:01.360]  investigations look at the stuff okay i just can't do it i've never seen it i won't see it
[1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:05.760]  i've seen some stuff investigating islamists that i couldn't believe so i just i guess i have seen
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:11.040]  them killing kids but the point is is that this stuff's meant to kill your soul imagine the guys
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.280]  that have to deal with it and then nothing's done on top of it that's one reason you see all the
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:19.120]  suicide with veterans people because they they understand that nothing's being done to fight
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:26.480]  real evil so now with our iodine we have to get it from gas drilling there's only a few big companies
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:30.800]  that go that deep to get it we all were the only company putting out deep earth crystal stuff you
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:34.720]  got to get dea approved because you do all sorts of stuff with us not what we sell you because it's
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:39.360]  put into palm oil but the the pure crystals that's why it's so good it's the good halogen it's helped
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:43.680]  me so much it's helped so many other people we're selling out of it and we've been selling us four
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:48.320]  years and i've never sat there and said oh by the way we might not be able to get the crystals
[1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:55.280]  anymore but now it's running into issues oh well you know when we go in it costs a lot to extract
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:01.120]  it when we hit 12 000 feet so you need to pay more and either we're not gonna we're either we're
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:06.160]  gonna get a new source or it's gonna go up in price because it already cost me a lot i mean we're
[1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:11.600]  talking there's like seven bucks of the iodine alone that goes in the bottle and then then the
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:16.560]  palm oil and the packaging and the marketing and everything else uh you know it's so so so the
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:23.120]  point is we've got but but we're running special 30 off and selenium from mustard seed needed in
[1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:27.280]  all electrochemical activity they go together like a horse and carriage super charging i mean
[1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:31.920]  i've lost 60 70 pounds folks i'm no beach body but you know the point is i work out less than i did
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:37.200]  but i'm trying to lose it because of the selenium because of the x2 supermail but it if you want it
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:41.360]  you better get it now because it's about to sell out then we've got one more big run we can do with
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:47.440]  what we've got left in our dea approved vault uh in a let's just say western state and we're supposed
[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:50.960]  to say where these where these factories are when you have this stuff because it's a big trusted
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:55.120]  company that makes it but they also are connected to pharmaceutical manufacturing but you just don't
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:01.200]  have precursors to stuff like many drugs you see because iodine's a key element folks so they can't
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:05.680]  stop us from having and giving it to you but there are rules how we get so support the point is we
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:10.800]  jump through a lot of hoops to get you this and now these oil companies know some big wheels
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:16.960]  are coming around trying to buy it up and so the squeeze is on us so it's just and then the word is
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:20.400]  that's the type of intel they're getting though they're they're just working around the clock i'm
[1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:25.360]  not sure that's what this is but the last month all hell's breaking loose so get your iodine support
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:30.320]  the broadcast i'm gonna still keep the price low uh even though uh we're probably to solve it so we
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:36.480]  got like 25 minutes 30 minutes left with our guests i appreciate him uh uh putting him with me
[1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:41.600]  while i'm trying to fund our operation but craig recap what you said earlier some of your background
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:47.200]  for new listeners that just tuned in craigsawyer uh tattoogleinsider.com the the sawman famous
[1:38:47.200 --> 1:38:50.800]  navy seal even more famous for folks that don't know what he actually did the seals for a former
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:56.800]  federal officer uh you know host of major tv shows i can't go over all of it you know history
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:02.560]  channels uh most deadly missions uh you've got of the program top shot all five seasons
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:06.720]  well as you're a prominent super respected guy you're coming out saying you have all these other
[1:39:06.720 --> 1:39:10.640]  colleagues that say they're covering up mass pedophilia we see the roundups happening we see the
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:16.480]  stories being killed that is all these should just be giant number one stories so take it over
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:22.400]  yeah well i do have a an eclectic background a kind of a white scope of a personal experience and i
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:31.120]  think that's what's allowed me to assemble this team of experts that are senior veterans of of so
[1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:37.520]  many different units law enforcement intelligence counterterrorist units that are very very very
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:43.360]  capable to spend their lifetimes solving very difficult problems internationally and there
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:49.360]  and all my colleagues are very good people and in this case we just want to rally around the
[1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:56.400]  innocent babies of children who are being tortured and their little lives and psychics have been
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:02.080]  shattered by pedophiles and learning what's going on and you're right uh president trump
[1:40:02.080 --> 1:40:06.480]  has this doj after these guys and they're they're making hundreds and even thousands of arrests
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:13.120]  now so thank god that's a great thing and what i have been frustrated in watching and others as well
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:20.320]  is how suppressed this issue has always been and it just seems like no matter how much good work is
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:25.920]  done trying to clean this up the american citizens don't really get to learn about it just just kind
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:31.840]  of goes away because quiet so when i was in the federal air marshall service i blew the whistle
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:38.160]  on a guy that was eventually taken down for gross mismanagement and retaliation and he was at the
[1:40:38.160 --> 1:40:44.640]  top of the las vegas field office for a while he'd come from there yeah so i saw how the government
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:50.160]  you know puts puts a damper on things that it doesn't want to get out and i saw what government
[1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:54.400]  crooks do what they look like when they can't control things in the case of the air marshall
[1:40:55.360 --> 1:41:01.200]  service the the those who are guilty of gross mismanagement at the top the air marshall service
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:07.280]  were very very rattled visibly shaken when they had air marshalls who were going to the press
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:11.520]  because these managers had their federal system wired and they could get away with whatever they
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:17.040]  wanted because they had come up through the ranks with their colleagues and other mspdb
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:23.760]  and different aspects of the federal government oig and so forth that are supposed to intervene in
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:29.120]  the case of mismanagement they had it all wired and and they were arrogant about it but they couldn't
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:34.720]  control those who are going directly to the media undercover while at the time i didn't agree with
[1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:41.120]  those going to the media i saw and observation how it rattled those who were crooked and that's
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:46.000]  what they could not control that's what they feared most and i think that's what i'm going to apply
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:52.080]  to this pedophile reign crisis and that's what i can do alex i'm not afraid i've got a unique
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:57.600]  background that allows me to have colleagues they're very connected very powerful and gathering the
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:02.480]  information cooperating with federal and local law enforcement being part of these investigations
[1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:09.760]  and busts and most importantly for us is sharing uh i'm getting over circumventing the gatekeepers
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:16.080]  of the big hollywood and the so-called news media who would keep this suppressed and getting it out
[1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:22.480]  there anyway against all odds so that we the american people can be informed and the the ultimate
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:30.400]  objective of my effort on this alex is to create a non permissive environment for this this scourge
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:36.240]  against our the very soul of our nation which is our children and again let's talk about what you
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:44.320]  just launched today vetsforchildrescue.org i know that that just across uh the patriots
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.280]  they're in law enforcement but also in the military you name it and also internationally
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:54.000]  people know this is real it keeps coming out the british police chiefs come out and say the whole
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:58.480]  government's run by pedophiles basically in the uk i mean most of the dominant positions
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:02.960]  they keep catching them in europe in huge rings and then it gets covered up and then i've talked a lot
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:07.680]  of people they say alex don't you get it they're not just mad at trump about trying to return
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:13.200]  power to america and make us great again it's the pedophilia that's and it's true when you
[1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:22.160]  hit on this all hell breaks loose for myself you um and again we're not trying to intimidate people
[1:43:22.160 --> 1:43:27.120]  for these groups it's just people you understand the old saying world war two bomber policies
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:30.640]  you know kreg you're over the target you're getting the flag they used to steer into the
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:36.400]  flag clouds throughout their bombs i mean this is like the flag on this is just incredible and i see
[1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:42.000]  msm because you know we come out and you know correct some statement we made on some issue or
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.320]  whatever about a larger topic and they go oh my god alex jones says pedophilia doesn't exist or
[1:43:46.320 --> 1:43:53.280]  whatever it's like so crazy to see major publications sexualizing children saying it's no big deal
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:44:00.400]  promoting it uh you know trying to sexualize children in the schools clearly they're obsessed
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:05.760]  with this and those of us that aren't like them just don't get it so from your sources and i've got
[1:44:05.760 --> 1:44:11.200]  a stack of news here i can show tv viewers just every day massive arrests of prominent pedophiles
[1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:15.120]  found with the kids it's not like you know it's just some child porn i put on a computer or something
[1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:21.280]  that's a classic setup how deep it goes how big it is and what your sources are saying from the
[1:44:21.280 --> 1:44:27.280]  things they're saying what i am learning alex is that some of the biggest names families and
[1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:34.080]  foundations anywhere um are complicit in this it's it's part of their culture it's a ritualistic
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:41.280]  thing that uh apparently they feel like they get power from doing these unspeakable unthinkable
[1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:47.520]  things to the infants i just i can't wrap my mind around it i've seen a lot alex but this seems to be
[1:44:47.520 --> 1:44:53.440]  the worst and whatever it is uh we're we're gonna expose it we're gonna we're gonna show the people
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:58.240]  a lot of people are taking advice from me craig you can't you can't show this american public
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:06.400]  can't can't stand it they can't you know they can't deal with it and i'm thinking men it's happening
[1:45:06.400 --> 1:45:14.240]  we we as a nation have to be at least strong enough if these children can endure this can't we
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:20.720]  pay enough attention to help correct it i mean that's the least we can do is at least tune in
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:28.800]  long enough to go hey look all right this is this is unacceptable we can group together we can unite
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:34.400]  just to create stronger legislation against this not to allow it to be normalized and say that it's
[1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:40.000]  okay because it's not okay for the infant that's that's tortured or murdered it's not okay for the
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:46.480]  child whose whose emotions or shatter their psyche is just absolutely devastating traumatizing
[1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:51.200]  and a lot of times they never recover they're never right even if they survive it physically it's
[1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:58.240]  unthinkable it it is evil the guys that are in on the closest part to the investigation alex are
[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:07.040]  calling it evil just due to how destructive and how deranged and perverse it is and my
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:13.760]  concern is how pervasive it is how many are involved and how wide it goes and i think the
[1:46:13.760 --> 1:46:21.120]  longer in my opinion the longer it stays quiet the longer these perverts and predators who are
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:28.880]  attacking the soul of our nation and our kids are allowed to to to enjoy the the fail of secrecy
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:38.320]  though the the more depraved and the larger this this thing grows this this beast so i think we've
[1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:44.880]  got to unrip the the lid off of it shine some sunlight on it in order to create a non permissive
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:49.840]  environment for this in the future that's right because there's nothing they censor more than us
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:56.800]  even trying to i mean that that ktla article where they admit kids found in cages and all this and
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:47:01.200]  you know 474 arrested and all the rest of it and the police finally doing this because they've
[1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:04.160]  got the green light from the president you know that at least we're gonna get some backing
[1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:10.560]  meanwhile we try to share that on facebook they won't let us do it and i guess we talked a few
[1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:13.040]  weeks ago at dinner we haven't really talked since then or wherever it was we can have a go
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:17.280]  i i guess not put words in but that's what finally pushed you over the line
[1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:21.760]  pissing you off that you'd try to even share links and they'd ban you and then personally
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:28.320]  seeing stuff going on in your town uh it's it's just this is a spirit uh so so can you
[1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:34.720]  i mean speak specifically uh to why you've launched and what's what's gonna happen with vets for
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:40.800]  child rescue dot org because if we get america's finest veterans and patriots and law enforcement
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:44.640]  speaking out openly by the way this is the most powerful radio we've ever done i'm gonna send you
[1:47:44.640 --> 1:47:49.200]  an external mic those the audio is better this is powerful craig and you know i talked to all
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:53.600]  these other guys and they just say that it's all well known it's documented it keeps coming out the
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:58.720]  un seems like people join the un to do this i got the un seems to be a cult that does it so it's
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:02.720]  i guess contractors you guys have seen this you know going on or heard about it and so it's just
[1:48:02.720 --> 1:48:07.360]  coming to a head it seems like there's an attempt here to just take over culture and kind of come
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:14.000]  out of the closet with the with the pedophilia and the satanism well if you look into the history
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:20.880]  of how the perversion in the united states has been incorporated into our our medical system
[1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:26.640]  into our educational system and into our laws it's been a very deliberate and systematic
[1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:33.280]  twisting of the truth and i know you you're aware of it alex but a lot of the other
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:37.760]  people aren't it i would encourage anyone to to research it if there are a lot of
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:42.800]  documentaries that have been put together investigators put together the history of
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:50.640]  that but it's it's a systematic campaign to break down the basic moral decency of the united
[1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:57.280]  states and one at a time normalize these these different types of perversion and and i say
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:02.800]  men you know whatever you do between considering adult adults is not really my concern what i'm
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:10.320]  concerned about is a child who can't say no child who has no say enduring the unthinkable child
[1:49:10.320 --> 1:49:17.600]  doesn't understand why these you should say it not because we want to act tough but but because
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:21.600]  it's true i must buy the streets my mouth off about violence but knowing what i know from
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:28.480]  behind the scenes and what's confirmed as a man i you know i i mean seriously i want the people
[1:49:28.480 --> 1:49:33.760]  tried convicted and and listen i'm happy to sit up there at the public square and hang their ass
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:37.360]  i'll sit there all day and flip those levers after they get a jury of their peers they want
[1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:42.880]  to mainline this crap they keep pushing they think they can dominate us i mean what is it like you
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:46.560]  are trained you know like you said a sheepdog a lover not a fighter but someone that's ready to
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:51.600]  you know kill bad guys how do you handle that animal energy because the reason i never focus on
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:57.760]  this too much over the years is when i do i get so pissed that i i just i i can't handle it i mean
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:05.040]  i get physically pissed off listening to this well i am angry about what i see alex but i find
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:12.960]  it having had a very sincere and devout pastor for a father who did so much good that it love is
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:21.360]  more powerful than it really is you want to rock something you want to devastate a campaign that
[1:50:21.360 --> 1:50:27.360]  is that is damaging you you do it with love and you stay within the lines of what people can
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:32.240]  can accept as is good and that's the most powerful thing i think i've heard in in
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:35.920]  in twenty two years of broadcasting let me say this i was having that feeling this morning
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:42.880]  that i was actually on my knees praying like five a.m because i hate these people so much that i feel
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:47.360]  like i'm becoming evil i hate them so much and i was just asking god to give me the strength to
[1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:50.880]  do this through love because that is what the strength is that's what i mean i do what i do
[1:50:50.880 --> 1:50:56.240]  because i love people but at a certain point it's just like i guess well how do you think i guess
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:00.640]  we just love it when you move forward but at the same time i guess we lovingly once they're convicted
[1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:08.000]  flip that switch well i i feel like i have to do this so i am unafraid this isn't about me i don't
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:13.840]  do this in my own space i'm doing this because i feel you're a tv host you make you doing a great
[1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:17.440]  job with the top guys in hollywood for training undoubtedly we talked about this off record
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:20.800]  i don't want to say it but we all pay a price for telling the truth like who cares we're telling
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:24.960]  the truth that's what really matters but yeah you're doing this despite the fact it'll probably
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:29.600]  hurt your career because you know what hollywood's packed with yeah i'm past that i'm past that they
[1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:39.600]  have no idea uh what's coming from me and mine i know i yeah look i know they i know enough to
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:44.800]  know the game of what's going on and the struggle for power of the united states and the rest of
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:50.400]  the globe but i'm focused on the united states and this is our home this is our nation and i am not
[1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:57.200]  afraid and i what i have seen really really makes the biggest difference is when someone who is not
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:01.920]  afraid takes it to the crux and a lot of people and this is what what i started to touch on before
[1:52:01.920 --> 1:52:08.640]  i didn't get it all out uh before alex is about overcoming fear it is it is those of us who do
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:15.280]  not fear that bring the fight to the crux that rattles them and shakes their cage and and brings
[1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:21.040]  their house of cards tumbling down it's not that i'm so brilliant and i'm so capable by myself
[1:52:21.040 --> 1:52:26.720]  again this isn't about me this is the fact that i feel that i've been called to to tear the lid off
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:32.320]  of this trying to sunlight on it and i am not afraid and so i am coming for them and yes i do
[1:52:32.320 --> 1:52:36.880]  have all the deadliest skills anyone's ever had us government thank you alex for your tax dollars
[1:52:36.880 --> 1:52:42.480]  and everyone else uh spending millions of dollars teaching me and training me to do so many things
[1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:47.440]  and all of the college that i've assembled to bring this fight forward and it's not about how
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:53.840]  spooky and deadly we are although we are but that allows us not to be afraid and not by our strength
[1:52:53.840 --> 1:53:00.160]  to do this but we carry the good fight forward to expose that which is unacceptable and simply
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:06.400]  clean it up i do not hate those as as despicable and harmful as their actions are against these kids
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:13.680]  i hate the i hate the act i hate the spirit on the victims that's what i hate if there's any hate
[1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:20.160]  it's that i love the children so much that i want to go and change this and i i fear not and i will
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:26.320]  not stop and let's be clear when they kill patriots or take us down or set us up or destroy us
[1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:32.400]  we chose this the enemy always celebrates it when when patriots fall people that love god fall god
[1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:36.400]  loves that that's an example the tree of liberty so let's be clear whatever happens to us in this
[1:53:36.400 --> 1:53:42.800]  mission and clearly now they've let us know this is the mission we chose we're not running away
[1:53:42.800 --> 1:53:48.160]  escapes on our plan we're we're here we're facing it we have victory by making the right choice
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:52.720]  that's what it's all about is the spiritual decision yep i watched my father do the right
[1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:58.880]  thing no matter what it cost him he was singularly focused on his relationship with god with his
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:05.360]  creator and nothing deterred him nothing distracted him he understood he was all about he was tuned
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:13.600]  in and i saw that that positive model was so impactful so powerful it's the most beautiful
[1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:21.920]  thing i've ever seen in my life and so i i use that as kind of a model to emulate if he can make
[1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:28.800]  that sort of impact what can we have and his and his under his influence and his guidance his his
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:37.920]  role model i tend to i intend to honor my father in in what i do in one day see him again hope that
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:45.840]  he's proud i know he will be but um pardon me it's it's an emotional thing because anytime i talk
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:51.360]  about my father there's a lot of good stuff but um talk about your father that's where you get the
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:58.400]  honor from talk about that it's okay go ahead yeah well again it's hard because it's so so close to
[1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:04.560]  home but i when i went off to the seal teams i couldn't come back home to houston texas and
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:10.400]  take my father anywhere without people coming up and hugging them and thanking him for all of the
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:16.880]  things that he did you know he would go to the prisons and you go to hospitals and you know the
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:24.480]  main streets and and and this helps people turn a lot of good stuff well the good news is goods
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:28.720]  coming back into the world and we're going to come after these evil people i think they're
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.560]  offensive against humanity is a sign of their actual weakness i think it's their battle the
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:39.120]  balls what do you think well again uh and let me continue on my fear thing i i have have seen
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:45.600]  that those who abuse their authority those that have abused their wealth those who abuse their power
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:55.360]  are the weakest among us so many americans the citizens feel disempowered and they feel afraid
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:56:02.160]  of those behind the curtain because of a big fancy title a big fancy name and and a picture
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:09.280]  that has been painted but what i have done by bringing bringing uh by blowing the whistle
[1:56:09.280 --> 1:56:15.920]  against high ranking crooks i have seen how rattled they were when somebody dared stand up to them
[1:56:15.920 --> 1:56:22.720]  and i saw how powerful that was and i and i learned who people are close to them how afraid they were
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:29.440]  of me and and how they were shaking in their shoes and visibly turning white at the mention of my
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:37.200]  name and again i don't think i'm i'm some sort of particular genius or or or a super spooky guy i
[1:56:37.200 --> 1:56:42.800]  think it's just i i will tell the truth and i will not be stopped with the spirit there to do that
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:48.160]  and and and the spirit of of doing what's right and i think that's what crooks fear most and i would
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:53.760]  i would encourage every american to feel empowered you are not as small as you would be led to believe
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:59.040]  you are not as insignificant as you are led to believe you are more powerful you have elected
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:03.680]  officials that you control whether or not they get into office at the local level let me just
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.920]  say this for the sourance because you're launching this and i'm glad you're doing it but people need
[1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:13.600]  to support it what is vets for child rescue dot org how do folks get that past the censors how do
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:18.720]  they support you and what are you guys planning to do with the support well first of all because
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:24.160]  they can't really see it on the screen i want them to know that the the website is vets vts and the
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:30.960]  number four and then the world child at the words child rescue dot org so vets for the number four
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:36.960]  child rescue dot org they can go there there's a way to donate we're starting a non-profit
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:42.160]  organization to do this independently so that we can get past the gatekeepers who would tell us no
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:48.400]  and suppress what we're doing and before we can get all the bureaucratic red tape done of

[2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:26.080]  nothing if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance we now take you live
[2:00:26.080 --> 2:00:42.000]  to the central texas command center it's alex jones
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:50.880]  don't believe the church and state and everything they tell you
[2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:58.640]  believe in me i'm with the high command big lawyers our guest tattletaleinsider.com is his
[2:00:58.640 --> 2:01:06.640]  main site that's for child rescue dot org and he's been trying for years to make films on tv about
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:11.120]  this he's just going direct to the public now to fund this and of course that's the overall
[2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:15.840]  media operation to then do other investigations and get the intel out from all his sources
[2:01:16.880 --> 2:01:21.200]  and you see the proof uh you can see what you want about trump on a few issues like this health
[2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:26.160]  care thing not being the best repeal of obama care but it's better than nothing whatever i'm
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:30.240]  surprised he didn't even get anything down there's total rebellion against him by the system and i
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:36.240]  just have stacks every week of literally like a hundred articles of like democrats republicans
[2:01:36.240 --> 2:01:41.280]  legislators judges being caught with children they've kidnapped i mean it's just it's just like
[2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:46.960]  look at the stack this week why is the msn ignoring trump sex trafficking bust that's town hall
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:51.840]  so this stuff's starting to come out but it's never been this big and it's not just child porn
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:57.760]  it's the actual traffickers people and filming it doing it and then the police and folks and
[2:01:57.760 --> 2:02:01.520]  believe they bring in military obviously or contractors and others that are contracting
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:07.040]  in to fill in these raids because a lot of these places are obviously heavily defended or whatever
[2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:10.880]  heavily armed and then then people see it and then they ask nothing ever happens where's the rest
[2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:16.320]  of the case it just gets shut down but we're almost there we're almost breaking through that bubble
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:23.760]  so vets for child rescue dot org go there spread the link spread the article donate uh again i'm
[2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:28.560]  personally going to give ten thousand dollars to this uh and that's a lot of money for us i'm going
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:32.880]  to give it today because i want to support what you're doing uh we got three minutes left i want
[2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:37.840]  to invite you back to studio to really break all this down soon craig but very exciting want to
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:43.200]  salute you and all the unsung heroes out there behind you well thank you alex i don't know if
[2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:50.720]  you guys have time to pull it up but that's that about us um icon on our page if your guys can
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:56.880]  pull that up yes we have it up it shows who all we've got involved in this team so we have a
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:04.720]  capability that we can do what we need to do we just need to fund it because by by keeping it
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:11.440]  independent and private like this we can circumvent the gatekeepers if we tried to do it officially
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:16.880]  it would be suppressed and and nobody would ever see or hear of it but if we want to rip the lid
[2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:22.400]  off of this we've got to maintain control and do it independently so that's that's what we're doing
[2:03:22.400 --> 2:03:27.520]  that's the model and we're going outside the lines and i think we're gonna we're gonna shake a lot
[2:03:27.520 --> 2:03:33.200]  of people up but that's exactly what has needed to happen for us far too long now because it's not
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:40.400]  just uh you know the british special forces or the german police or mi6 or cia or national
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:46.640]  security agency or navy seals or army and all these great folks i mean again they already know
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:51.040]  about it because they're on the inside they're ready to go this is one of the greatest forms
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:55.200]  of resistance against tyranny i've ever seen and look our own military said no four years ago about
[2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:59.840]  the arab spring and told obama no one that had checkmated him so you guys have already i gotta
[2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:05.200]  say it uh you guys have already led the way i'm really impressed well uh so many of these guys
[2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:11.680]  that have that have agreed friends of mine to be part of this are our big names on their own right
[2:04:11.680 --> 2:04:16.640]  and they've done they've got big careers behind them and it's that experience that's together
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:20.960]  is going to allow us to make a big difference and they're putting their name like john handcock on
[2:04:20.960 --> 2:04:26.400]  the declaration of independence against these damn pedophiles yes sir this is our way of doing it
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:30.400]  it's our way of doing it i've got leah magna coming in if you can do five more minutes i want to come
[2:04:30.400 --> 2:04:33.760]  back and just ask you about the decision to finally do this i know you have new other folks
[2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:38.240]  were getting involved starting to get ready there's just this all over the place people are moving
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:41.600]  they're not waiting for orders from headquarters are going to the sound of the guns let's come back
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:45.600]  and talk about how this came together and and like you said of this about page i had no idea you
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:51.280]  guys had like mi6 and uh special air services and the german special forces and i mean these
[2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:56.160]  folks are pissed folks and uh this is big we'll be right back with craig soyer who's helping bring
[2:04:56.160 --> 2:05:02.080]  all this together he's so respected stay with us the mainstream media was added again pushing a
[2:05:02.080 --> 2:05:07.760]  fake news hoax that trump's former national security advisor michael flinn offered to
[2:05:07.760 --> 2:05:14.720]  testify before congress in exchange for immunity this hoax was debunked shortly after twitter users
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:21.280]  began posting the actual letter which stated no reasonable person who has the benefit of advice
[2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:27.680]  from council would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized witch hunt environment without
[2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:35.920]  assurances against unfair prosecution so it's protection from unfair prosecution not immunity
[2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:42.000]  to state wrongfully that flinn is seeking immunity in exchange for his testimony is a way for the
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:48.960]  divisive mainstream media to imply that flinn is guilty to ask for protection against unfair
[2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:55.840]  prosecution is completely reasonable and doesn't imply guilt for more reports go to info wars dot

[2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:19.840]  now just because we defeated these tyrants for now does it mean we've won the war the war
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:26.400]  this happened within our hearts within our souls and our minds we have to be good we have to be pure
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:31.200]  we have to be strong we have to build prosperity we have to bring every one of every race color
[2:08:31.200 --> 2:08:37.040]  and creed together if we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believe we were going to fail
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:43.520]  who believe their divide and conquer would work yes we've won the first phase but the battle
[2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:50.960]  for the soul of humanity has just begun but obama and hillary and soros
[2:08:50.960 --> 2:09:15.760]  he were losers from the day you were born it's also what happens when you listen to the radio
[2:09:15.760 --> 2:09:29.040]  host alex jones we pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the american flag info wars
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:34.880]  helped fuel the rumor that president obama is an icis supporter it's been a cozy relationship
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:41.520]  from the beginning i will not let you down you'll be very very impressed i hope and i think we'll
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:48.960]  be speaking a lot no trump and alex jones this means that donald trump will be the 45th president
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:57.760]  of the united states waging war on corruption is alex jones all right correct soyer is our guest
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:02.080]  well i wish he was in studio for this is the stuff he's laying out it's just so powerful
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:07.600]  and it dovetails with all the sources i've got top retired generals i don't mean retired 20 years
[2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:14.480]  ago i mean retired like two years ago uh just intel people patriots law enforcement we can be
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:18.560]  critical of the government does some things and and and he gets given orders that aren't good but
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:23.520]  the point is they're not pedophiles and they stand up for innocent people and i got to say i've been
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:28.320]  a big critic back in the day of of the military because i saw it as the power of the globalist
[2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:33.760]  but i see it now is what's biting him in the ass was never anti-military because that's who leaked
[2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:38.320]  the info to get trump elected that's who's fighting it's not the russians and they're so pissed that
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:43.200]  patriots in our military in our intelligence agencies got the info the american people like
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:51.200]  this new vault seven stuff that's from the cia and i just look how it's crazy is like almost
[2:10:51.200 --> 2:10:57.440]  everybody in the actual work in government is actually good at doing a good job and they're
[2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:02.080]  run by a bunch of scum one little layer above them and then now trump said they're trying to totally
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:07.680]  ignore him and then trump is actually going after the pedophiles i was like it's like 10 times the
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:12.160]  average monthly arrest it's just they're rolling them up and they're catching them with the kids
[2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:20.320]  people actually producing it and so again you ask 186 arrested here 4 and 74 arrested there 200
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:25.600]  arrested here 25 rest there caught with the kids caught in some cases you know they're killing them
[2:11:25.600 --> 2:11:32.800]  satanism is is the they don't just rape them and a lot of them they use abused kids it's like the
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:39.040]  procurers to go out like the renfields for the metaphysical draculas and get the kids and it's
[2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:47.680]  just what's crazy is they've gotten emboldened so they're just running wild right now and it's
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:52.080]  like a algae bloom or something in your pool i mean we've got to dump some bleach in here or
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:56.880]  something show uh we're leon you've got a ton to cover on this you got a bunch of big breaking news
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:02.400]  we got so much to get to but uh craig soyer everybody technical insider dot com i'm personally
[2:12:02.400 --> 2:12:07.200]  going to donate ten thousand dollars because i know this guy's not about the money this is a
[2:12:07.200 --> 2:12:11.760]  hundred percent about jewel what's right he has top discovery history channel shows we had private
[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:15.920]  discussions all he wants me to repeat the things he said but obviously you do this you're you're off
[2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:20.480]  tv the guy's in giving him hundreds of thousands of dollars he doesn't care because he's got all
[2:12:20.480 --> 2:12:24.400]  the sources that are on these raids and they're seeing it and it's being covered up and i'm not
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:27.680]  just getting it from craig i already are getting this from all my sources so i'm at dinner with
[2:12:27.680 --> 2:12:34.080]  them hearing all this and i know all these other sources including family that just recently got
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:39.440]  out of the army and and so it's just like they're like you won't believe how widespread it is it's
[2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:43.760]  like seven elevens i'm gonna say seven eleven's bad i'm saying it's like it's all over the place it's
[2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:48.880]  like these people are so emboldened they're so arrogant that's why they're pushing all over the
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:54.240]  news the pedophilia is okay and liberal publications saying what's wrong you know if they want to date
[2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:59.040]  your five-year-old daughter and i'm just looking at these guys you know on these videos on salon
[2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:04.320]  i can't help it i got daughters i'm just thinking i'm not gonna shoot this mouth off i'm like kill
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:09.920]  kill kill i mean i at a certain point it needs to stop it needs to stop and like craig said it was
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:15.680]  so powerful it's love of the children is why you do it because looking at these people infects me
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:21.280]  with with just rage that i i i just and i'm praying to god to control it because
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:25.920]  and sure some of the rage is across the listeners so this is my other trans but i don't do this on
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:30.320]  purpose point is i can't handle it anymore so i'm gonna ask craig and then just other key points
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:34.400]  you want to make and and just your sort just some of the other stuff your sources are telling you and
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:37.840]  some of the other things that are happening here why you think the elites are so scared right now
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:41.920]  just other little points but getting back to how you control i guess you have no problems you just
[2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:46.720]  love your dad was a great well-known preacher and patriot so you cheer will do it for loving
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:51.120]  reasons i do things for loving reasons too it's more like i'm psychoanalyzing myself right now
[2:13:51.120 --> 2:13:57.920]  because i just get so angry at these people it's it's it's it's become an issue craig yeah well i
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:04.800]  mean the book when spending a career in counterterrorism it's easy to get angry at the behavior at
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:11.120]  the destruction at the at those who would just make the world a lot worse place but uh if you
[2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:17.200]  i've found that i i just focus on what is it that i care about what is it that i'm defending
[2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:24.320]  and that's helped me really really stay focused on what matters and and and make the most the
[2:14:24.320 --> 2:14:30.320]  biggest impact you know i i've always in service of the of my country in the military i've been
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.280]  focused on the american citizens that i was defending that which i cared about the sanctuary
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:40.480]  but i wanted to provide for them and ensure i was maintained into the future that's what was in
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:45.280]  my mind i didn't hate the terrorists i hated what they were doing and i was willing to kill
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:50.960]  you know tens of thousands of them in order to stop uh their negative impact and keep them from
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:56.880]  coming here and i think it's the same thing with these pedophiles i i don't i don't i don't think
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:15:02.320]  it's it's best to just let this seething hatred overwhelm us because i think it's counterproductive
[2:15:02.320 --> 2:15:08.560]  in the long run i think we stay focused on on the innocent children and what we want for them
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:14.960]  and how many of them we can prevent from being rolled up into this horrible horrible situation
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:21.200]  in the future and how many we can free who are in bondage right now and uh if we stay focused on
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:28.080]  that i think we'll have our best impact that's that i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:32.720]  saying that will help us keep our sanity along the way in this fight because it's it's dark
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:39.200]  what we're discovering and uncovering is not thinkable it's not it's it's a sick mind that would
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:45.280]  torture an infant to death sexually for some sort of ritual um because that is the end of the rabbit hole
[2:15:45.280 --> 2:15:51.600]  is is satanic torture of children to death yes sir yeah that's what we're learning so and the argument
[2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:56.800]  is oh we can't tell the public because they'll get too freaked out exactly and return the republic
[2:15:56.800 --> 2:16:02.800]  and go after these people uh vets4childrescue.org uh again i mean i noticed the last few months
[2:16:02.800 --> 2:16:07.360]  you've been aware of where this for years but it's coming to a crest trump leading the fight
[2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:13.280]  against it but wow wouldn't you decide to do this and how did you so quickly get this unprecedented
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:21.520]  array of patriots uh from every major uh in you know western intelligence operations special forces
[2:16:21.520 --> 2:16:27.680]  uh you name it i'm the sas the model the whole special forces system well each of these are
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:33.920]  close personal friends alex that i have either protected in harm's way or have worked with
[2:16:33.920 --> 2:16:41.280]  closely and and really really uh dangerous places or have been on job joint operations with or have
[2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:47.440]  come to know um by being like minded and so these are these are fantastic people i'm so proud to
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:54.640]  know every one of them and so over time this team has kind of uh just assembled itself by being
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:17:03.360]  like minded every individual has a wealth of expertise to bring so um it it's a formidable
[2:17:03.360 --> 2:17:10.240]  task force if you will and so i look forward to us getting that in into motion uh under this new
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:17.600]  org and having a power impact there so again it's about exposure that which has been suppressed there
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:22.640]  are those doing great investigations and and arrests and that's that's outstanding that's
[2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:27.040]  fantastic but that never gets on the news so you're going you're going to go cover all the stuff that
[2:17:27.040 --> 2:17:33.520]  the enemy doesn't want covered yes exactly that that's it that's it it's an info war you realize
[2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:37.520]  that they're shutting down all the real stuff that's happening we're stopping a lot of it but
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:42.400]  they're they're covering up the light you're bringing the light and that's why people want men
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:46.640]  and women to there's some great women involved in this as well to march out and take action
[2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:50.800]  people need the funding i mean i i look at police chief saying when coming out and saying yeah
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:54.880]  pedophiles run everything here they are we caught you know you have to show when that when that police
[2:17:54.880 --> 2:17:59.760]  chief comes out that everything they're they're under attack but the good news is is more of us
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:05.440]  stand up pretty soon the intimidation doesn't work and i'm like again they try to pull stuff on us
[2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:10.400]  whatever just i'm committed that's why they're so scared you're committed craigsawyer a tactical
[2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:14.720]  insider.com is your main website vetsforchildrescue.org we're going to skip this break so we have more
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:17.920]  time he's going to leave in a minute leon you i know we've got other topics to cover but i know
[2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:22.640]  this is something you've covered and focused on as well and and we we've committed now the national
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:27.120]  media has come out and said said that you know pedophilia doesn't exist and we're all insane
[2:18:27.120 --> 2:18:31.600]  need to be shut down that okay you don't like this we're going to triple down right now uh leon
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:37.120]  well it's just so incredible because it makes you realize how high up the chain this goes
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:44.080]  and how very high level people are protecting this type of perversion and so they're really the
[2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:48.720]  only stories that you'll ever hear about are the the families who are on drugs and they try
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:53.680]  to sell their little kid on craigslist they try to make it seem like it's just this seedy you know
[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:57.760]  why is it almost always a homeland security deputy director flying to rape the two-year-old
[2:18:57.760 --> 2:19:02.720]  exactly i i mean that's they had a like the human trafficking report they put out every
[2:19:02.720 --> 2:19:08.080]  a few years it says they're expressly that the way that this is allowed to happen is you have your
[2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:12.080]  board of patrol you have your high level people in politics who are able to
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:17.520]  keep the channels going they're the ones that are kind of you know who you you go to report
[2:19:17.520 --> 2:19:22.400]  to the police chief but if the police chief is involved he's going to say and let's be clear
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:25.680]  most the board of patrol most the military the police are the best people out there
[2:19:25.680 --> 2:19:30.480]  it's key people in key positions exactly who can shut down investigations and then they have the
[2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:35.360]  media attack the patriots that's why the military and police are so ready to expose this because
[2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:40.160]  they've been sitting there watching is is that accurate correct yep you're absolutely right
[2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:45.360]  so many people out there are great fantastic in and doing their jobs in good faith with all their
[2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:50.800]  heart and soul but it is those that are in key positions that have been bought out or are complicit
[2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:57.120]  anyway who are are suppressing it and that's to finish answering your questions that that's why
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:20:03.280]  i've gotten so agitated and so determined and so vocal is because i got sick of the suppression i
[2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:10.800]  got sick of out of 152 thousand facebook followers only five or ten thousand people ever see a lot
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:15.840]  of my posts now after they change their algorithms and and i've got people actively following let's
[2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:20.400]  be clear as soon as you started exposing pedophilia they cut you by 90 percent let's talk about your
[2:20:20.400 --> 2:20:28.560]  facebook as well so well it's uh facebook i can't i can't attach that one to the pedophilia but i
[2:20:28.560 --> 2:20:32.960]  think it's more of just being a conservative to be honest with you because that was about a year ago
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:39.440]  that uh that that one dropped off and now that i've mentioned the pedophilia the the blue
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:47.040]  verification check on twitter went away so twitter's got my government issued id and i've had a blue
[2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:53.200]  check there for years and so now everybody's very angry on twitter going hey this is bs why they
[2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:57.840]  do this to this veteran man what's what's really going on there at twitter they should be ashamed
[2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:03.360]  you know why why you know why mess with a guy who's just telling truth so twitter made me like six
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:08.880]  years ago when i first got on it i came to a light shinned in my id and i got a little blue check that's
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:13.200]  i didn't people's then know it's you because he's like well why do you care let's say craig or i leave
[2:21:13.200 --> 2:21:18.480]  or you leave twitter they'll have all these imposters saying they're us saying horrible stuff on purpose i
[2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:22.960]  have to be verified right you almost have to be on it because it is like the internet to then
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:28.480]  counter the bs right craig yep yep so you know i want to speak for myself i don't want anyone
[2:21:28.480 --> 2:21:34.480]  else speaking for me and uh that's been a strange situation so all that's kind of really just agitated
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:39.200]  me and put me over the top i'm like you know what if if i want to be suppressed and beat up and shut
[2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:42.960]  down and all these doors are going to close in my life when i'm trying to do good things and things
[2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:47.440]  are just kind of mysteriously keep going quiet i'm just going to go straight into the to the fight
[2:21:47.440 --> 2:21:52.240]  i'm just going to roll up my sleeves and and give a big up yours to those who want to silence good
[2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:59.280]  decent americans and suppress this this pedophile nonsense i'm coming at them so they they can thank
[2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:04.320]  themselves for that with their meddling and interfering in an attempt to suppress a good
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:10.080]  patriot well now now you've done it now i'm coming that's my philosophy yeah the crazy thing is i'll
[2:22:10.080 --> 2:22:14.400]  be tired and and and then they try to shut me down and attack me and it's like all of a sudden all
[2:22:14.400 --> 2:22:18.400]  this turns right and it's weird they're like they keep like threatening me and doing stuff and like
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:23.040]  do you not understand i but i don't get it because i don't play any mr badass or anything but it's
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:27.360]  fundamentally as a human and as a Texan as an american people try to push me around
[2:22:29.040 --> 2:22:33.360]  that they like find like my legs that's like then i'm alive when that happens right it's
[2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:38.080]  i and i think they think i'm like them they think like threatening me is going to make me run off
[2:22:38.080 --> 2:22:42.560]  well that's something i've really learned by working here is to you have to channel that
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:22:48.880]  anger and the the the depression just the disgust when you learn about the things that are going
[2:22:48.880 --> 2:22:54.320]  on in this dark underbelly it can really paralyze you with anger fear and you have to channel it
[2:22:54.320 --> 2:23:00.480]  into positive uh organizations like this where you can say let's use our skills and our talent
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:05.440]  that we have to take the bad guys out and then do this investigation let's channel this into
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:09.920]  something positive or we can actually help rather than you know they just want you to be silent sure
[2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:13.760]  and i don't want to moralize people we're just little little info wars now is attacked second
[2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:18.320]  only after trump and they the enemy hates us it's because we're just doggedly never stopping
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:23.760]  all right craig soyer we salute you for your work vets for child rescue dot org i don't we've got
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:28.000]  you've got children i've got children we're all in this together and i will just leave it at that
[2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:32.080]  but uh we really appreciate all you've been through i don't we're going to get into that but
[2:23:32.080 --> 2:23:37.200]  thank you so much for but i guess all they've done is piss you off worse right that's it
[2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:42.960]  that's it you know um i'm just going to amplify my positive efforts after having been stifled
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:50.400]  initially uh well stand up and that's why i've i've assembled a team of those who are particularly
[2:23:50.400 --> 2:23:56.320]  skilled and deadly so that uh we don't we're not the kind that you intimidate we're the kind that
[2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:01.200]  when you you come after us at backfires on you things go horribly wrong on your end so it's uh
[2:24:01.200 --> 2:24:06.160]  uh there's a there's a reason there's a method to what i'm doing here all right god bless you craig
[2:24:06.160 --> 2:24:11.680]  we'll talk soon amazing vets for child rescue dot org and i want to make sure accounting is
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:15.920]  ten thousand dollars right now i want to see that uh on the donate button i want to see that go up by
[2:24:15.920 --> 2:24:19.520]  the end of the by the end of the hour next hour the day of the night host i want to see it go up
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:23.920]  ten thousand dollars uh because you could not give money to a better uh thing and again this is all
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:29.040]  about funding people to go out and do hardcore stuff and believe me they are so upset threatened
[2:24:29.040 --> 2:24:33.840]  by this so upset see i noticed i got some contacts not just talking to him and a bunch of other people
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:40.000]  as well in the last month they're particularly pissed off not about what i was saying on air
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:44.560]  but that they're already so scared of the military and law enforcement that's a way and then they
[2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:49.360]  realized they're linking up with info wars and i mean i've had state department high level cia all
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:52.800]  of them they're not saying hey you better stop they're like oh my god they've you've really got
[2:24:52.800 --> 2:24:56.240]  people scared right well because they know you're not going to back down you're not afraid to put
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:25:01.920]  the truth out there you're not i mean i'm even afraid i can't not stand up to people kidnap
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:06.560]  the kids i it's like i can't help it i mean you know right i mean i couldn't be one of these cops
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:10.560]  so if i went to some places kids in cages i mean well we saw what happened i catch people in there
[2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:14.880]  you're you're you know we saw what happened with ben swan and i don't i haven't followed up on that
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:18.480]  so i don't he did nothing he did a milk toast report they banned him over everything with stuff
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:24.480]  that was verifiable he's a great journalist but took totally memory hold him from the internet
[2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:29.440]  and all of his youtube channel everything so that's that's the kind of power which is really crazy
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:35.280]  because something like this with with child uh pedophilia human trafficking that's like a huge
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:40.240]  you've got hillary's main lady doing it and hey he being convicted you've got epstein there's just
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:45.520]  so much it takes hours to go over and the media goes alex retracted himself he's he made up hillary's
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:50.960]  killing kids in the basement i never said that my reporters never said that i talked about syria
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:56.720]  they edit they edited together down again but we did follow the media focusing because it was all
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:01.040]  about pizza code words on a pizza place pizza code words is not a pizza place i said no we
[2:26:01.040 --> 2:26:05.600]  can't prove that these people are probably you know nice folks whatever because the media was
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:11.360]  making it a distraction by focusing in on internet reports that we covered too on an organization
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:15.280]  that's probably completely innocent or whatever and then i clicked remember i came in like december
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:20.560]  first i said shut this down i said nobody's covering the podesta stuff his brother in in
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:23.600]  it because it's all about being out in the open with it oh we have pictures of naked kids on our
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:28.720]  walls you know they're they're in the washington post saying it they were pulling all that see
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:33.440]  they because they were kind of having this moment where it was all out pushing it and salons like oh
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:37.280]  yeah you know let us have your kids and then notice they pulled all that now they're like it doesn't
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:42.320]  exist it doesn't exist right when they were just pushing that it was the next sexual thing right
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:47.360]  so i don't know how far the rabbit hole goes with these people i just know obama didn't order
[2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:52.640]  65 000 with the hot dogs at a party and i know they're like well we'll have the kids for entertainment
[2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:56.320]  you know they're pretty well behaved you know they are kids it'll be in the hot tub waiting for you
[2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:01.360]  and you know like what is this i mean i've had lawyers that are looking at this go at first
[2:27:01.360 --> 2:27:04.640]  you're like you know when i'm getting threatened and stuff they're like top lawyers are like yeah
[2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:09.680]  this you might have like wow i didn't know all this reviewing was this is crazy what's this right
[2:27:09.680 --> 2:27:15.360]  and it's like yeah i mean how dare you allister crowley stuff and like little kids at parties
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:20.960]  and like vats of blood and what the hell man this is what they put the new york times it's it's art
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:25.840]  you know take your little girl to a vats of blood and then like you know podesta i'll be there
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.080]  we're gonna have the semen and breast milk ready for you the spirit cooking that's like and then you
[2:27:30.080 --> 2:27:35.840]  realize people out in hollywood that old allister crowley crab that's what sharon tape murders and
[2:27:35.840 --> 2:27:41.760]  all that helter skelter was well this is i mean this has been around for a long time and and here
[2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:47.600]  in the united states people really suppress their perversions and so when you have to suppress your
[2:27:47.600 --> 2:27:55.280]  your your shadow self it emerges in a darker way absolutely and it's just you know i found because
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:28:00.480]  my shadow self got expressed a lot when i was younger that now it's like my good sides i think
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:04.640]  there's really something to that because they take a period in society i'm not demonizing
[2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:08.800]  christian i'm a christian but extreme forms of it just like islam you sit there and it
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:13.200]  suppresses everything so then the good things become bad and the bad things become and then
[2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:17.440]  you don't know anymore what's good and bad and then you gravitate towards the worst thing because
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.920]  most of these people that are into this crap are the most suppressed people ever right right that
[2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:26.720]  i have not been allowed to express themselves at all and that the thing with this story is like this
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:33.200]  should be the juiciest i mean they cnn did 24 hour news coverage of a missing plane for more than a
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:38.320]  month because they when there's one mother they think might have kidnapped her kid it's it's on
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:44.960]  news for months top ratings you have kids in cages mass arrests ktla and then nothing after nothing
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:51.520]  the cops put it on the line they go they catch them right when you have exposed in california
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:57.280]  that a thousand foster homes a thousand foster homes out of the you know hundreds of thousands or
[2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:03.040]  whatever a thousand of them were in the sex offender registry foster care parents a thousand
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:08.080]  that's what i see over and over again it's like one county in california how does that happen and that's
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:11.760]  not all over the news that's not a huge story that's not a massive investigation and then
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:17.120]  we're bad and weird to say pedophilia exists and investigated and then if we're not absolutely on
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:22.000]  target on somebody else's report they say oh we're sorry that's a correction like oh my god
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:29.520]  alexa mr. so pedophilia america thank god yeah yeah it's just incredible oh tell your children not to
[2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:37.200]  walk my way tell your children not to hear my words what they mean what they say on my low

[2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:04.960]  the mainstream media was added again pushing a fake news hoax that trumps former national
[2:30:04.960 --> 2:30:12.240]  security advisor michael flinn offered to testify before congress in exchange for immunity this hoax
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:19.280]  was debunked shortly after twitter users began posting the actual letter which stated no reasonable
[2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:25.040]  person who has the benefit of advice from council would submit to questioning in such a highly
[2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:31.840]  politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution so its
[2:30:31.840 --> 2:30:39.440]  protection from unfair prosecution not immunity to state wrongfully that flinn is seeking immunity
[2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:45.520]  in exchange for his testimony is a way for the divisive mainstream media to imply that flinn
[2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:52.560]  is guilty to ask for protection against unfair prosecution is completely reasonable and doesn't
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:31:00.480]  imply guilt for more reports go to info wars dot com this is millie weaver reporting the reason

[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:04.240]  and did he talk to russians or not and oh he wants immunity because they want to go after
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:09.200]  him for lobbying for turkey which is you know what what generals do and those are some paperwork
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:16.800]  not filled out right and you just watch how the media puts it all on the patriot movement
[2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:22.080]  and then and for all trumps intelligence and spicer and the rest of it they still sit there
[2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:27.040]  and only kind of partially shut the new york times and see in an office sit there they respond
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:31.840]  to all their crap like asking you know when's the last time you raped your wife or when's the last
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:37.840]  time you sold pcp to five-year-olds in ten buck two and i'm like i never sold pcp to anybody
[2:34:37.840 --> 2:34:42.080]  much less than buck two or never raped my wife see that i mean that's what i'm talking about here
[2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:46.800]  is that they just change the subject they know they don't have any credibility they know they
[2:34:46.800 --> 2:34:53.200]  have a seven percent approval rating but they can still kick off bs and have us respond because i
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:58.320]  mean i gotta respond when they say alex jones senate investigation is under fbi investigation
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:04.160]  from being directed by the russians no one directs me i wish i directed myself i'm interrupting

[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:12.720]  the top he got a bunch of other news to hit we got a bunch of clips to go to david night's coming
[2:35:12.720 --> 2:35:16.560]  up but it is just it is just an incredible time to be alive like well like you were saying during
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:22.640]  the break the hottest topic is satanic networks pedophiles we know what's going on it's confirmed
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:29.200]  all the time he had swept him the rug the media again ignores it huge arrest happening of the
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:35.360]  most sensational stuff i mean 28 kids in bondage sex slavery in an organized pedophile network
[2:35:35.360 --> 2:35:41.440]  that's just one thing ktla of hundreds i have last month hundreds of articles 3000 plus arrest
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.240]  total nationwide biggest ever and this isn't again just child porn this is the people that
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:50.480]  grabbed kids out of backyards little joey was grabbed two years ago he's been rescued little
[2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:55.840]  jenny these each of these stories would be top news stories right and there's zero coverage leon
[2:35:55.840 --> 2:36:00.640]  well they're so desperate for ratings why would they not want to speak about this topic all
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:06.240]  i was pointing out this is their religion they can't how much the fundraiser has gone up in
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:11.360]  in donations just in the few moments that you were speaking with vets for child rescue.org
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:17.360]  like 19 000 i mean it jumped up great job people really care about this topic they're really concerned
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:23.040]  they really want to change things and as desperate as cnn or rachel maddow or all these people are
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:28.880]  for ratings because they're totally failing why would they not want to cover this topic that people
[2:36:28.880 --> 2:36:35.280]  really care about it makes no sense unless you understand how high profile how high up the
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:39.920]  chain it goes and that they they want to shut this down that's right let's put vets for child
[2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:45.680]  rescue.org back on screen and again this is literally just a pay for the air flights and then the cruise
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.400]  look at that i mean it's already gone up a few thousand just since the last time she

[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:36.640]  put out i mean it is traumatizing to just think so you can imagine that was confirmed out on
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:44.240]  nebraska yeah i mean it's just what was the guy's name sandusky and so how he's kind of funneling
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:50.640]  these kids out of i remember i remember john the camp the state senator and people on my show 20
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.680]  years ago saying they're running kids through penn state and boys town i remember delaying them
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:39:59.920]  just back then i didn't really want to get sued how sick are you at the point was this is like
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:06.800]  15 years before it came out exactly and of course the camp was cia because they know they were like
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:11.520]  literally exposing this and they poisoned people i mean i've been talking to people behind the scenes
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:16.160]  i don't want to tell people what's up what's going on i just i can look at people like the camp
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:21.520]  you have to be to set up a child rescue center oh you're gonna help the troubled teens because
[2:40:21.520 --> 2:40:25.760]  they've been that's what they always do they've had such a hard life they've had you know everything
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:30.640]  thrown against them i'm gonna help them out and then you go and pimp them out to your
[2:40:30.640 --> 2:40:37.360]  elite friends i mean sick you know they the media will attack me the media will attack me if i say
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:42.400]  i'm not making a threat i'm saying i had a gut level i would enjoy beating jerry sandusky's
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:47.440]  brains out with a baseball bat okay and i don't say that's act tough i i have to be honest that's
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:51.040]  all i do is tell you what i'm really thinking when i look at sandusky and all the little kids he
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:54.720]  raped now he was right next to a playground and all the and i know it's way beyond that he's a
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:41:01.360]  procurer folks sandusky 100% siren field and i i literally i want to go into a room of the
[2:41:01.360 --> 2:41:06.080]  renfields and the draculas and i want to pull out a big sword i don't want to say to all them pull
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:12.320]  your weapons let's get it on because i am just so sick of them i am tired of them i am sick of
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:17.360]  their crap and if they want a war they're gonna get one i'm not called for violence i guess and
[2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:24.000]  again we people need to be convicted i'm saying at a fundamental level with all this going on
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  and then trying to sexualize our kids in the media and all of it and nicolodian it's like
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:34.160]  we should all reject these people lianna absolutely and you know just listening to mr
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:39.760]  soyer in the vets for a child rescued dot org and just it gives me hope i mean it's still very
[2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:44.880]  scary but there really is nowhere to hide these days with thanks to the internet and if people
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:50.400]  putting this information out there not backing down not being afraid to get all of your videos
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:55.040]  taken off youtube in order to get the story out there's nowhere to hide and i think that's what
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:42:00.480]  they say on their main page there it's sunlight is the best disinfectant yes some media has
[2:42:00.480 --> 2:42:04.240]  come out and said you know what is alex jones flipping out again about pizza gate it's not
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:09.440]  pizza gate the media made that they focus they focused on groups either they're innocent or you
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.320]  can't prove stuff to make it all then go oh look the catholic church never did anything oh sandusky
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:18.640]  never did anything they're literally in the news now i'm going oh yeah and then you ask yourself
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:24.480]  who the hell is the mainstream media to sit there and know this is an epidemic admittedly even in
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:30.400]  the courts with convicted people and just make a joke out of it wow i'm i'm just glad i'm not those
[2:42:30.400 --> 2:42:37.040]  people because you know well i i mean i think the good thing you can say about this is that
[2:42:37.040 --> 2:42:44.160]  their time is nigh for them to be the exposure is that why they're freaking out so bad absolutely
[2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:49.360]  and that's why they are circling what is your female intuition tell you well i mean i saw
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:53.680]  i could sense that it was a little we see how they're shutting down all the different avenues
[2:42:53.680 --> 2:42:57.840]  all the different revenue streams uh you know here at info wars they're trying to just kind of
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:43:03.680]  hit you from all angles so that at some point they can just take you out at least or really
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:08.960]  try to take one of the legs out because we're one of the only places that is going to be able to
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:14.480]  put the truth out there on a mass scale honestly i wouldn't pull a stunt like going off air to show folks
[2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:17.840]  if they actually kill me or shut us off to them any idea what's going to happen
[2:43:18.560 --> 2:43:24.320]  they're so dumb sorry leah interrupted no it's just i mean it we see what they're doing and i
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:27.840]  think everyone out there can see what's going on as well which is why a lot of people are kind of
[2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:33.040]  confused and then wondering well why is he backing off okay no he's not backing off i mean you got
[2:43:33.040 --> 2:43:38.240]  to understand these are really sick very scary we're not playing games folks we're not we're not
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:41.600]  just i'm not bashing people that are just only internet posting comments that's important
[2:43:41.600 --> 2:43:46.080]  we're out here with our names our kids our family it's all up front right people don't know the stuff
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:50.320]  you've gone through i've gone through i mean it's it's real this is not a game yeah and it doesn't
[2:43:50.320 --> 2:43:55.040]  intimidate us it makes us stronger you think they're gonna create a cia sock puppet accounts just
[2:43:55.040 --> 2:43:59.280]  to troll people on the internet because you're talking about hillary clinton's health you don't
[2:43:59.280 --> 2:44:04.320]  think they're gonna go to an even greater extreme if you're someone who's really acting well they go
[2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:09.920]  off your family edithalia that listen i can't say it but some of these military guys they've
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:13.760]  they've had their families targeted and these military guys i love it they're just like now i'm
[2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:19.760]  really going that's like yeah i like that spirit i mean we're all gonna die i mean it's the truth
[2:44:19.760 --> 2:44:24.080]  here in the u.s and within the west we're afraid of that we we kind of put it off like it's not
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:29.760]  even gonna happen we're all gonna die so you've got to put yourself all the way out there in this one
[2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:34.880]  life that we've got something has got to really drive you and make make it worth it yeah what
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:40.560]  defines you going along being a trendy believing media that hates you i mean i'm not even saying
[2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:47.600]  follow what i say just be real folks stand for something exactly absolutely you know we have
[2:44:47.600 --> 2:44:52.800]  just this one life who gives a crap if you have a hundred million dollars and you're 88 years old
[2:44:52.800 --> 2:44:58.640]  what did you live for what did you stand exactly money is only a tool to do great things who cares
[2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:03.840]  if you have all that money in the bank what'd you do with your life what'd you stand for it's a paradox
[2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:08.560]  i don't even want to live in an upper middle class area the people on average are so obnoxious but then
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:14.160]  if i live in a blue color area then i'm kind of seen as a myelitis living there like why am i there
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:23.440]  i just want to like be invisible but we have to be visible to defeat the evil that's so true
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:29.360]  it's very true it's like a it's the 22 you know i hate being on social media and having to put
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:34.960]  myself out there but at the same time if you use it wisely and you're able to put out a good message
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:40.560]  and reach a lot of people that's powerful that's why they're so afraid of info wars because we're
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:45.760]  putting people like well you hate google so much and facebook why are you on it we we have to be
[2:45:46.400 --> 2:45:51.440]  that's we have to be until they shut it down we've got to reach as many people as possible
[2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:55.520]  that's why you have got to share the articles and share the links and do your part because
[2:45:55.520 --> 2:46:00.320]  they're shutting down our reach just with their algorithms so we can defeat them if everyone
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:05.440]  kind of gets in it and the thing is they're celebrating imagine in america the democratic
[2:46:05.440 --> 2:46:14.080]  party nazi collaborator funded organizations like media matters are celebrating victories to shut us
[2:46:14.080 --> 2:46:19.440]  down and shut drudge down and we just and it's just like oh well that's just how it is the left
[2:46:19.440 --> 2:46:23.360]  just shuts people down they just beat people up at demonstrations because they're the liberals
[2:46:23.360 --> 2:46:29.760]  they have the moral high ground and i'm just sitting here looking at them going you understand
[2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:35.360]  your next plan is shut us down and then physically come after us and then our plan is
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:44.240]  game over dumb butt and it's not like it's not like i'm saying things that i can't cash it's like i
[2:46:44.240 --> 2:46:49.760]  know you're gonna lose a physical confrontation right that's why they run around squealing and
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:53.520]  yelling you know all day about all we want physical stuff they're the ones that are physical
[2:46:53.520 --> 2:46:58.560]  they don't have i mean i just they just can't help it i've seen so many times like
[2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:03.920]  some thug will come up punch you in the nose and as soon as you got their head going down on
[2:47:03.920 --> 2:47:08.800]  the concrete you're like crying for mommy i'm like listen man you asked for this this is what
[2:47:08.800 --> 2:47:13.600]  you wanted see so now you're gonna get it i don't understand why they just have to get run over
[2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:17.680]  they just keep hitting hitting hitting because they know that if you're the piece you're you're
[2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:22.240]  gonna be the peacemaker you just want to let's just have a civil conversation let's talk this out
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:26.960]  and they're violent they're trained on being violent to get what they were they're trained by a guy
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:34.320]  that pledged himself to lucifer yes yes so eliske what the very first radical that's what he says
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:38.320]  and notice it's all true not the fake christian church what god gave us we're given all this
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:44.720]  prosperity we're already made an image of god we already are the little g and the devil comes along
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:50.160]  it says i'll teach you how to do all this it gives us all this twisted weird fraud that's just designed
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:57.600]  to siphon and steal intellect and build crap and it's just it's all just ridiculous we already
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:03.120]  have all of that power within us we've done these pedophiles could go out as a the mainly men
[2:48:03.120 --> 2:48:07.840]  we've got a real male bashing wire most of psychopaths and killers men there's women too
[2:48:07.840 --> 2:48:10.880]  though now but it well there are some that's like nine percent male from our criminology
[2:48:10.880 --> 2:48:14.720]  being crippled wrong but the point is you could have had a wife you could have had kids you could
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:18.160]  have had like a guard in your backyard you could have looked up at the star has been part of it
[2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:24.000]  you chose to be cancer in the universe that's what evil is they chose to be cancer and not just
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:30.400]  go with it right they're not with us we have to understand they're not with us right they're not
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:34.800]  we don't want to destroy them we think they're with us they're not they've got to be cut off
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:40.160]  and separated and that's hell we don't make hell god doesn't make hell they are hell they're with
[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:45.040]  themselves Liam no i agree with you that that there comes a certain point where you don't have
[2:48:45.040 --> 2:48:49.680]  to reach every single soul that's out there some people have already made their choice
[2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:55.680]  and that's okay we have to keep on moving forward growing evolving we bettering our own selves and
[2:48:55.680 --> 2:49:01.360]  not worried about all the little trickle down at the scum at the bottom of the barrel and the
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:08.320]  scum hates the very existence of the light because it sees its ugly face in and and wants to destroy
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:14.640]  an innocent child because that's that's their ultimate selfish act of a seed of a free will
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:20.320]  and a whole destiny and you can rob it and you can name it you can screw it over well and there's
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:25.760]  and there's actual transfer of energy there's an actual transfer transfer energy the ball
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:29.680]  being hammered upside their head but you have to do it again and again because that's the
[2:49:29.680 --> 2:49:34.400]  little power the little energy surge you feel is is fleeting in it the more you do it the less
[2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:41.680]  exciting the energy sphere is you losing your soul they think they think that tango is them
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:47.120]  getting power it's them being sucked down right i mean i i you know there's a lot of people
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:53.600]  that have like porn addictions and the more the more you watch it the and the deeper you go it gets
[2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:58.160]  less sensational so then you have to just keep going darker darker more perverse and there's just
[2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:04.240]  awful wicked stuff out there that even children are now being coming in contact with because of
[2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:10.560]  the internet and it's just you've got to stop and ask yourself whoa who who am i who do i want to
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:18.240]  be i'm headed down exactly but cnn said pedophilia is a conspiracy theory well that's because
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:23.760]  pedophilia is is they're trying to push this as a new sexual orientation a new gender identity
[2:50:23.760 --> 2:50:27.280]  and they want whether it's vaccines or whatever to get kids as young as six seven to be able to
[2:50:27.280 --> 2:50:32.320]  consent to vaccines they want to have the state come in be the mommy and daddy then con the kids
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:35.360]  do whatever i want to hit some other international news you've got there in your stack they have a
[2:50:35.360 --> 2:50:40.720]  night coming up as well well obviously jam packed news but there's a full on war to bring down trump
[2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:48.080]  by the most evil forces this planet has ever seen does that mean trump's perfect none of us are
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:53.120]  but he is not out to get you and he is rounding up the pedophiles and that is i think his greatest
[2:50:53.120 --> 2:50:59.200]  sin according to them that's why they are sworn to destroy him because they want your kids when a

[3:00:02.160 --> 3:00:21.120]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:25.360]  you know it's happened a couple of times in the tens of thousands of articles that have been written
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:34.240]  mainly demonizing me that they called me dog like dog like determination and in my life the dogs
[3:00:34.240 --> 3:00:40.320]  i've known are better than most of people their spirit is so real and it's it's so determined
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:45.520]  and it's so honest and that's why they're our best friends and i just think about that dog like
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:50.800]  determination and i am proud and i'm not bragging i'm just a listeners know that i always got brought
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:56.640]  up here in texas and i was thinking about texas lore but i do love the fact that in the white
[3:00:56.640 --> 3:01:00.480]  house they don't call me alex jones when they talk about what we're doing or when they give us
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:08.240]  call they say what is the texan doing the president says what is the texan up to and so i am just so
[3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:15.200]  honored that they see me as the ark type of a texan and that's what it's all about anyways leon
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:20.800]  looking at all this and it's not about me it's about the victory we've had by just standing up for
[3:01:20.800 --> 3:01:26.080]  what's right and the dog like determination the bulldog like determination in their face other
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:31.520]  points you've got i don't think it's a coincidence that the eu nazi connected dude wanted to uh
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:37.040]  take austin out he name dropped austin which is of course the central texas committee i notice
[3:01:37.040 --> 3:01:41.280]  what did he say about austin you know forgot that he was like threatening donald trump because he
[3:01:41.280 --> 3:01:45.440]  you know supported brexit well we're going to come in there and break up the united states we're
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:51.600]  going to take out austin in ohio like totally random that's all you know about our country is
[3:01:51.600 --> 3:01:56.720]  but then again it is the central texas command centers no but it's because austin is a un model
[3:01:56.720 --> 3:02:02.800]  city it's it's totally controlled they admit that it's the model of enslavement because like why
[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:08.240]  not separate why not california they want to exit they want to break up you know it's just
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:14.560]  it was weird i just took it as a little point of a little badge of honor that austin got a name drop
[3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:21.120]  but i want to just kind of point out here we're we're still hearing all about russia that's the
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:27.120]  top story again and again cnn has the top players in the russia gate saga however nothing there with
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:32.960]  the john pedesta and his connections but wiki leaks just released um the latest files today
[3:02:32.960 --> 3:02:41.120]  676 files part of vault seven and these are giving insight into the cia's marble software so this is
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:46.400]  software that can forensically disguise viruses trojans and hacking attacks and what it does is
[3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:52.480]  it changes the source code so that it makes it appear that it's chinese russian korean arabic
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:58.960]  and farsi which is the iranian language rather than english written code so they can blame a cyber
[3:02:58.960 --> 3:03:04.960]  attack on whoever they want which is very dangerous when you think um you know hillary clinton came out
[3:03:05.840 --> 3:03:11.600]  as she was campaigning saying how she would go to war over a cyber attack so they could just
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:19.040]  false flag set up any country that they want the perfect provocation false flag cyber attack attack
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:23.360]  russia attack anybody they've said that right i mean so what what constitutes a cyber attack they're
[3:03:23.360 --> 3:03:29.840]  actually uh now trying to lobby to restrict the term cyber attack because it's just kind of a loosely
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:36.320]  generalized term what constitutes a cyber attack because they're they want to be able to respond
[3:03:36.320 --> 3:03:40.640]  at the very highest level based on this so they're already kind of setting us up they're letting us
[3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:45.920]  know that our grid is uh very susceptible to a cyber attack meanwhile they full steam ahead
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:51.520]  they're putting everything to the grid uh out of zero hedge this facial recognition software
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:56.400]  couldn't snare millions of innocent americans for crimes they didn't commit so we now we know
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:01.440]  that police departments they're starting to move forward uh with this type of precognition facial
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:07.600]  recognition software and according to their own research it's wrong a lot of the time there's a
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:12.560]  one in five chance of recognizing the wrong person so you could be charged with the crime you didn't
[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:16.720]  commit and then you're already ensnared in the meanwhile with these databases they already know
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:21.600]  who all the criminals are that's there's not allowed to move on them so here's the thing i used to
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:25.920]  bash the tsa and they do a lot of bad stuff let's not divert them to them it's congress that did
[3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:30.880]  it let's end it the problem cops do a lot of bad stuff too let's change it instead of right well
[3:04:30.880 --> 3:04:35.280]  and uh judge napolitano that was one of the key things that he mentioned when he was brought back
[3:04:35.280 --> 3:04:40.080]  on fox news says he stands behind his story the sources stand behind it trump was surveilled
[3:04:40.080 --> 3:04:45.360]  and what's so important is that in october all of these surveillance things are up for kind of
[3:04:45.360 --> 3:04:51.520]  renewal so the american people really need to be concerned and focusing on well how how much
[3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:58.240]  surveillance are they allowed to do leon macdo you are on fire leon macdo's are florida corresponded
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:03.920]  debonite's coming up the mainstream media was added again pushing a fake news hoax that trump's
[3:05:03.920 --> 3:05:10.080]  former national security advisor michael flinn offered to testify before congress in exchange
[3:05:10.080 --> 3:05:17.040]  for immunity this hoax was debunked shortly after twitter users began posting the actual letter
[3:05:17.040 --> 3:05:22.960]  which stated no reasonable person who has the benefit of advice from council would submit to
[3:05:22.960 --> 3:05:29.120]  questioning in such a highly politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against
[3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:37.520]  unfair prosecution so its protection from unfair prosecution not immunity to state wrongfully that
[3:05:37.520 --> 3:05:43.440]  flinn is seeking immunity in exchange for his testimony is a way for the divisive mainstream
[3:05:43.440 --> 3:05:51.040]  media to imply that flinn is guilty to ask for protection against unfair prosecution is completely
[3:05:51.040 --> 3:05:57.280]  reasonable and doesn't imply guilt for more reports go to info wars dot com this is millie weaver

[3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:40.640]  they told me to uh to say that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable

[3:10:43.120 --> 3:10:50.080]  David Knight here on this fourth hour but we've got some breaking news Alex shows us staying
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:54.400]  along uh for a little bit longer here to break this down also we got a Don Salazar
[3:10:54.400 --> 3:11:00.480]  who has the story Alex tell us this breaking news i talked about this earlier i've exposed
[3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:04.960]  pedophilia before it's well known british police chiefs for coming out it's in major news that
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:09.280]  basically runs that government the EU's run by it it's it's like a dark cult they get you into
[3:11:09.280 --> 3:11:14.400]  that's well documented pedophilia is the fact it goes on nsm's trying to mainline it
[3:11:14.400 --> 3:11:19.600]  Craig Sawyer is a former leader one of the major seal teams yeah he won't get into it but he's one
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:25.280]  of the most elite seals ever and he also has been a federal officer and we see trump i think that
[3:11:25.280 --> 3:11:30.880]  a folder not your fault guys but bringing in with just the 3000 plus arrests of pedophiles kids or
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:35.760]  reported pedophiles kids in cages so they're not pedophiles just little kids in cages their houses
[3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:42.720]  and how it ties into government and i talked about how we start covering this now and trump
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:51.920]  is going after them that they're just we're off ad roll uh they're saying ban is on google uh
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:57.600]  they're going after our suppliers for supplements in the iodine i mean it let me tell you this
[3:11:57.600 --> 3:12:02.080]  isn't like dealing with law firms and stuff this is intelligence agency stuff but separately i'm on
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:07.440]  the phone with top retired generals as high as it goes i'm on the phone with you name it it's not
[3:12:07.440 --> 3:12:11.440]  bragging it's just there are a lot of patriots in the government i'm actually surprised how
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:16.000]  many more aware of this and they understand this is what welds it all together and so i go give during
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:22.960]  a break ten thousand dollars to exposing pedophile rings in docu series by spec ops vets with a guy
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:32.720]  craig soyer who's the host of five seasons of top shot and uh a bunch of other top tv shows
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:39.120]  soyer again history channels most deadliest missions i mean i've watched that show he's a
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:44.320]  he's got clothing lines he's you know author top trainer one of the main guys in hollywood
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:49.200]  training people and of course he's been told shut up about this you'll be you'll be shut down
[3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:53.040]  then he wouldn't shut up over a month ago i don't think we're doing this privately
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:57.040]  separately how to talk to some other special ops guys current informer and they said they're just
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:01.920]  all over you know in this trump deal that the military is actually involved in this in task
[3:13:01.920 --> 3:13:06.400]  forces and i already learned about this when he was just president elect they got green lighted
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:11.360]  from separate green berets delta force people i mean trump literally has tweeted you know he
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:17.520]  wants to go for pedophiles three years ago well he is so that's why we got to be careful about
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:21.200]  you know who we're covering who we are because there's so much real stuff we don't want the
[3:13:21.200 --> 3:13:27.680]  media to put out fake stuff have us focus on discredits so craig soyer is on and i and so
[3:13:28.800 --> 3:13:32.560]  it was like 20 something thousand dollars got donated while he was on another 15 20
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:36.640]  thousand got donated and by the time they shut it down it was like at 50 grand so it was it was

[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:34.800]  and we had a un whistleblower come in and and blew the whistle had to resign because he couldn't get
[3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:38.160]  the un to do anything about it finally he got somebody in the french government to do something
[3:16:38.160 --> 3:16:42.640]  about it because they were involved in this peacekeeping operation in england we've got we
[3:16:42.640 --> 3:16:47.040]  reported articles about how they're saying don't name streets after these politicians because we've
[3:16:47.040 --> 3:16:50.880]  been embarrassed too many times find out that the pedophiles afterwards former prime minister
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:56.960]  heath edward heath they had i was told and then they had they had a couple of dozen people come
[3:16:56.960 --> 3:17:00.880]  forward and say we were molested so what they did was they they had to back that back it was an
[3:17:00.880 --> 3:17:05.200]  embarrassment for them so they said don't name this after any people anymore because we got too
[3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:10.320]  much and by the way i had a former bbc broadcaster top bbc broadcaster their main morning show on
[3:17:10.320 --> 3:17:16.240]  years ago and he started saying edward heath didn't just rape little girls he'd they put plastic out
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:20.400]  on the floor and then he'd slit their throats i was delaying and kicked the guy off the show
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:26.080]  ten years later it came out rape little girls confirmed and the word is with jimmy savel satanic
[3:17:26.080 --> 3:17:30.240]  rituals this is because they found the dungeons yeah so i get it we're not into raping little
[3:17:30.240 --> 3:17:35.280]  girls or killing them but but listen but they forget all that for not named streets after them
[3:17:35.280 --> 3:17:38.080]  exactly you're going to take over men i'm sorry to barge into your hour day we'll have his own

[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:44.880]  as straightforward as it gets you know we want to prevent children from from being um abused by
[3:19:44.880 --> 3:19:49.280]  pedophiles that's that's that's pretty honorable stuff no matter how you slice it so this is concerning

[3:20:11.600 --> 3:20:16.000]  within one hour normally if something's a fraud razor it takes days to shut it down
[3:20:16.000 --> 3:20:20.880]  they let jihadi's raise money everywhere all over line to kill people you are seeing as a
[3:20:20.880 --> 3:20:27.120]  producer i want to do a show on sex trafficking and again they want to make it about prostitutes
[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:31.520]  that are 20 or something being brought in from on duras okay great stop that that's what the news
[3:20:31.520 --> 3:20:36.160]  does you know at nfl games or whatever you're literally have the sources that's why they're
[3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:43.040]  so scared this is absolute like proof of how you're on target so i want david to jump in here
[3:20:43.040 --> 3:20:47.280]  and i've got a don salazar ready to come in uh who got the screenshots and contacted them but just
[3:20:47.280 --> 3:20:55.280]  look i've gone from like you know being concerned about this to totally obsessed with it this they
[3:20:55.280 --> 3:20:59.360]  are they are running scared and what do you think happened to you caring one of the big crowd
[3:20:59.360 --> 3:21:05.360]  sourcing sites when when a celebrity known veteran super patriot with two tv shows on
[3:21:05.360 --> 3:21:10.560]  astral cable cannot do a fundraiser for children being uh for investigations of the pedophilia
[3:21:10.560 --> 3:21:18.800]  yeah says it doesn't look good does it um you know again they they've yet to contact me back
[3:21:18.800 --> 3:21:23.920]  and answer my question on on what's wrong there what what violation are they claiming i don't
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:27.840]  even think that they can come up with a violation that that that they're they're hanging their hat
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:34.480]  on uh this is really really but you know we knew this would be an uphill battle and a hard fight but
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:39.680]  what starts straight out of the gate they don't want this out there and so it's it's disgusting
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:45.120]  to me if this is part of it if it's not just a technical glitch this is pretty uh pretty sickening
[3:21:45.120 --> 3:21:53.440]  to see that whoever at you caring um has a problem with us you know exposing pedophilia so is is you
[3:21:53.440 --> 3:22:00.000]  caring involved are they complicit we have no way of knowing um until they get back to us and articulate
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:05.840]  what what sort of um violation they're they're claiming because i don't i can't imagine for
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:10.800]  the life of me what it what it would be this is as straightforward as it gets and to be clear
[3:22:10.800 --> 3:22:14.560]  i did my retraction last week we do retractions all the time we make a mistake but we're proud
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:19.920]  of our retractions we want to be accurate you have pedestrian emails come out spirit cooking
[3:22:19.920 --> 3:22:24.480]  allister crowded stuff talk about kids at rituals i mean just thousands of emails i couldn't even
[3:22:24.480 --> 3:22:28.320]  read them anymore because it was like in between the rituals and like we're gonna have lots of
[3:22:28.320 --> 3:22:32.880]  blood and semen for you and breast milk it'd be like yeah we're gonna screw over our constituents
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:36.960]  and you're just reading the nastiness and then there's all these pizza connotations in the fbi
[3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:42.560]  manual they say that that's you know cheese pizzas child porn all that stuff then they they genius
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:49.760]  divert in the media off some 4chan comments they probably posted the mainstream on to a pizza place
[3:22:49.760 --> 3:22:52.720]  where we couldn't prove it one way or the other we kind of covered go oh no i think they're probably
[3:22:52.720 --> 3:22:58.240]  innocent then they turn it into oh alice jones recant pedophilia doesn't exist anywhere in the
[3:22:58.240 --> 3:23:03.120]  world and so i would imagine they probably just because that's what they're doing trolling everywhere
[3:23:03.120 --> 3:23:07.760]  they're trying to roll out that pedophilia doesn't exist they try to roll out that it's a good thing
[3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:14.800]  in salon and cnn and the trendies you know and all these advertisements for for for clothing
[3:23:14.800 --> 3:23:19.120]  they're all pedophilic none of that works so now they're back to we don't exist so
[3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:22.800]  david night we're bringing don salazar in on this i'm glad craig was able to
[3:23:22.800 --> 3:23:28.560]  pop back in stay there craig for more comments but this just smells like victory i mean again
[3:23:28.560 --> 3:23:32.480]  they're saying terms of service we shut your countdown we hope it's a glitch i'm sure they're
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:38.160]  great folks but i said this to him an hour ago to craig craig i said everything i do on this is
[3:23:38.160 --> 3:23:43.280]  instantly shut down in real time this isn't artificial intelligence this isn't bots this
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:50.720]  is people watching everything we do in live time trying to stop trump well it would appear that way
[3:23:50.720 --> 3:23:56.160]  you know i'm a federal criminal investigator and i i'm inclined to wait and sort through the facts
[3:23:56.160 --> 3:24:02.000]  and and and come to my conclusion based upon that but all i can say is meanwhile it doesn't look good
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:09.120]  until they'll come up with an answer they're they're claiming a their terms of service have
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:13.600]  been violated what is that violation we need that right now because they're saying a federal
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:19.600]  officer of former top navy seal national tv show host and a guy that saved the rhinos is not allowed
[3:24:19.600 --> 3:24:26.240]  to raise money to investigate pedophilia yeah yeah yeah i mean i think americans need to be um
[3:24:27.680 --> 3:24:32.640]  asking some hard questions what is what is this uh claim to violation well craig i'm gonna tell you
[3:24:32.640 --> 3:24:36.640]  what's about to happen i've already experienced it they've tried financial stuff i can feel it my guy
[3:24:37.440 --> 3:24:40.640]  they think we're cowards they're about to go physical we all need to be on absolute alert
[3:24:40.640 --> 3:24:44.640]  right now i can feel it this is destiny i think we're about to beat them and i'm not just saying
[3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:50.560]  i don't ever say that on air i am feeling a moment right now in my gut that i believe we've crossed
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:55.600]  a threshold with your courage and all our listeners courage i believe we're crossing a threshold
[3:24:55.600 --> 3:25:05.200]  that if we just stay stay strong hold fast those kids are crying out to god to be saved
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:11.760]  and we're doing that we don't want to be savers we're not it's got to be done and so as men we
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:16.880]  can't be intimidated by this we have to ask god to give us a guide just to have victory craig go
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:23.920]  ahead i'm sorry let me share this let me share this the reason i i went with uh you care is because
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:30.320]  go fund me but when i was wrapping up the campaign with go fund me it seized up they locked up my
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:35.360]  account before i was even finished writing it up and and attempted to launch they got ai that's
[3:25:35.360 --> 3:25:39.520]  what i said they've got everybody they've got ai watching what you wrote yeah that was my question
[3:25:39.520 --> 3:25:43.360]  is why didn't you use go fund maybe and that that's let's i'm elaborate i'm sorry i interrupted
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:48.480]  let me just paint the picture real quick i was in the middle of writing it up and never even i
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:54.480]  wasn't even gonna launch it for a few more days so i was i was in the middle of writing it up and
[3:25:54.480 --> 3:26:01.840]  then it uh notice popped up saying hey your account has been um locked or something to that effect
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:08.080]  and depending further uh review for three days and i'm like well three days i've i've i've done
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:11.840]  these kind of things before and if they have a question there's an instant help chat that pops
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:16.000]  up and they and they help you work through to fill you any of this is shut down and i know i just
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:21.120]  expand we have reporters like paul watson who has obviously reached 30 40 million people a week
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:26.560]  now so he's a superstar now we say like we're stars but he's you know he's able to meet with
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:30.880]  the top folks that nobody else has to meet with you know years ago matt drudge you name it like i am
[3:26:30.880 --> 3:26:37.680]  him he's been talking a lot of people i was leaving at that that are ready to move in england and
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:43.040]  uh they've just been waiting for people like this and i just want people to know this is this is game
[3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:47.680]  changing so craig uh we hope you caring is wrong it doesn't matter a hundred thousand dollars and
[3:26:47.680 --> 3:26:53.520]  i'm gonna tell the listeners um we we've been hit hard we've been and i'm not bitching about it i
[3:26:53.520 --> 3:26:59.760]  just want to win money is fuel in our coffers but i think we're just gonna have to go uh they'll
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:03.920]  even get into our mail to god i've had him do that before too we're just gonna have to directly get
[3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:09.440]  the money to this organization because they know how real craig is what a what a what a you know
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:14.880]  it's an insult to say rock star but just what a prime mover you know in the in the great success
[3:27:14.880 --> 3:27:19.840]  of the things he's done the spirit of christ they can't go from his father and everything he's done
[3:27:19.840 --> 3:27:24.800]  and the fact that these men are standing up and they already know what trump's doing it's just we
[3:27:24.800 --> 3:27:32.240]  need to pray for everybody and realize that this we are fighting pure satanism right now and and i uh
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:37.600]  you know i just if people knew what craig's gone through the last month the things i've gone through
[3:27:37.600 --> 3:27:41.920]  and i'm not complaining about it it's just these people are so bad and they've got to be broken
[3:27:41.920 --> 3:27:45.920]  we've got to break their backs for the children like you said not in a hateful way because i tend

[3:29:54.960 --> 3:30:04.880]  the mainstream media was added again pushing a fake news hoax that trump's former national
[3:30:04.880 --> 3:30:12.160]  security advisor michael flinn offered to testify before congress in exchange for immunity this hoax
[3:30:12.160 --> 3:30:19.200]  was debunked shortly after twitter users began posting the actual letter which stated no reasonable
[3:30:19.200 --> 3:30:24.960]  person who has the benefit of advice from council would submit to questioning in such a highly
[3:30:24.960 --> 3:30:31.760]  politicized witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution so it's
[3:30:31.760 --> 3:30:39.360]  protection from unfair prosecution not immunity to state wrongfully that flinn is seeking immunity
[3:30:39.360 --> 3:30:45.440]  in exchange for his testimony is a way for the divisive mainstream media to imply that flinn
[3:30:45.440 --> 3:30:52.560]  is guilty to ask for protection against unfair prosecution is completely reasonable and doesn't

[3:33:24.960 --> 3:33:29.680]  alex was talking to craig sorrier the man with a long distinguished military career man who has
[3:33:29.680 --> 3:33:36.240]  been an advisor doing films about security issues i sort of think they're setting up a crowdfunding
[3:33:36.240 --> 3:33:42.000]  and that they were talking about a crowdfunding film and they got shot shut down and immediately
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:45.520]  after this interview so we've got alex jones as well as craig sorrier talking about this
[3:33:45.520 --> 3:33:49.840]  award and adan solazar has been waiting for 30 minutes i'm sorry to bar jen on all this
[3:33:49.840 --> 3:33:54.080]  is there to he got the document he got the clip and craig's also talked to him you just
[3:33:54.080 --> 3:33:58.240]  violated our terms but it's cough to us they don't tell you what crime you've committed
[3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:03.120]  so you got a guy with two discovery and history channel shows you've got a guy that is known for
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:09.120]  wildlife conservation you've got a guy that led major seal operations and the most elite teams
[3:34:09.120 --> 3:34:13.520]  will just leave it at that and now they say he doesn't get to exist as i said an hour and a half
[3:34:13.520 --> 3:34:18.160]  ago when he was on air and we're going to add on a moment but craig did i not say this is the issue
[3:34:18.160 --> 3:34:23.840]  they shut us down in real time because trump is doing thousands of busts every month they're
[3:34:23.840 --> 3:34:29.840]  catching kids and like in dungeons they are so scared of this and let's go to your page
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:36.720]  vetsforchildrescue.org see that's not a third party site like you care where they shut him down
[3:34:36.720 --> 3:34:42.400]  you go to vetsforchildrescue.org you can see in live time the $50,000 that was donated when he was on
[3:34:42.400 --> 3:34:47.280]  they got pissed because they didn't want that or whoever made the call whatever sunlight is the best
[3:34:47.280 --> 3:34:52.880]  antiseptic for corruption well it's been shut down so uh we're going to go to adon just a moment
[3:34:52.880 --> 3:34:57.440]  and but but just what is it like to see this in real time for you uh craig?
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:04.640]  well it's upsetting i initially expected that maybe we crashed their server with such a positive
[3:35:04.640 --> 3:35:10.240]  result and then uh now see your your staff's interacting with the mask and what what's going
[3:35:10.240 --> 3:35:14.960]  on and they're they're claiming some sort of violation of terms of service my question is
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:20.320]  they should be able to immediately answer our question what is that violation we can we can
[3:35:20.320 --> 3:35:26.080]  satisfy violation of terms of service is pedophilia of the new protected class is pedophilia of the
[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:33.120]  new protected class that nobody's going to tell you that it is nobody's going to admit to it
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:36.880]  they're just going to pull like they're going to pull your stuff off the air they're going to
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:41.600]  undermine you behind the curtain because it's shameful it's despicable it's disgusting i don't
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:46.960]  want to own it they just want to do it and here's how it works you're not doing it behind the curtain
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:51.840]  so let's go ahead and go to adon salazar with craig adon jumping here you went made the calls to
[3:35:51.840 --> 3:35:56.400]  the comments you've got the screenshots this is just incredible how in lifetime they're
[3:35:56.400 --> 3:36:00.800]  he couldn't even get a go fund me you know because he was exposing pedophilia good god this is the
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:06.560]  new this is the new protected class of dawn yeah well basically i wrote the article x navy seal
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:11.840]  launches operation to expose pedophiles to promote mr soyer's operation veterans for
[3:36:11.840 --> 3:36:19.840]  child rescue and i was having uh i was enjoying going back and checking the uh the donations
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:26.560]  and they kept increasing exponentially and at certain at a certain point after 30 minutes of
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:32.720]  the article being up the donation page shut down and i couldn't figure out why so i tried
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:36.640]  very it was exponential it stopped at 50 grand it probably would have had a million oh definitely
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:41.440]  uh so i tried to reach out to these people through twitter and facebook and the only way
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:45.840]  i got to them was through the uh you caring website and i had a conversation with somebody named joey
[3:36:45.840 --> 3:36:50.720]  and she said that they had violated terms of service but they couldn't identify the particular
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:57.280]  issue so i'm reporting on pedophilia of violation of terms of service sorry craig go ahead david
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:02.800]  jump in no i didn't go there there there you go their non answer is our answer we can deduce
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:09.920]  from that if they cannot if they cannot state what their claim to violation is then that's how
[3:37:09.920 --> 3:37:18.800]  we know that it that's the shame on him and if you can ban craig soyer you can ban anybody
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:25.440]  yeah because craig is so respected in not just contractors not just delta force not just navy
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:30.000]  seals but everything i mean you can't talk about it but you've been in all the elite units you know
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:34.400]  the joint forces all the stuff you've done the big missions you've been there uh we can't even say
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:39.200]  what still team you're with which i don't get because it's public but uh fine and then you're
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:42.960]  just nothing of these people you're just you're nothing but your whole life online and they have
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:47.840]  no idea since you started planning this stuff that's happened to you that they just sit there
[3:37:47.840 --> 3:37:54.960]  living off what men like you have done pissing on you and it makes me mad yeah yeah yeah they are
[3:37:54.960 --> 3:38:01.280]  the weakest among us alex they're there the the lowest form no matter how much wealth or status
[3:38:01.280 --> 3:38:07.600]  they may enjoy what they do behind closed doors what they do to these children makes them evil the
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:14.720]  torment the shattered lives and the the trauma the emotional psychological trauma let alone the
[3:38:14.720 --> 3:38:21.440]  physical trauma and that they do to these infants and children is is unthinkable it's despicable so
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:27.920]  craig is it just me or do i smell victory in this though there's desperation in our free society
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:33.120]  censoring people with discovery channel shows and history channel shows from just doing it go
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:38.960]  fund me for make a film about sex trafficking i mean i mean because everywhere now you just
[3:38:38.960 --> 3:38:43.760]  sex trafficking your band it's like this is the new protected group because they're so desperate
[3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:47.840]  like the catholic church to block it well this is a hundred times bigger because they know the
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:52.000]  dam is breaking craig i smell weakness i don't just have to be confident but i feel weak i'll
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:59.040]  admit it i feel confidence right now well you know pedophilia cannot it can never be a protect
[3:38:59.040 --> 3:39:06.400]  or protected um group or practice because you have an unwilling victim it's not something
[3:39:06.400 --> 3:39:13.040]  like an incident something adults the the child or the infant has no ability to escape or say no
[3:39:13.040 --> 3:39:18.080]  so that's what makes this so so bad and so unacceptable and david has a key point the mass
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:22.720]  sacrifice is the babies and people being indicted for showing the babies being kept alive being
[3:39:22.720 --> 3:39:26.800]  harvested david yeah i wanted to talk about that but you know when you talk about they can never make
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:33.120]  this accepted because we have we do not have uh as you're considering adults okay that's what all
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:37.280]  of this stuff about transgenderism is as far as i'm concerned it's about saying that we can have
[3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:41.760]  five six seven year olds decide that they want to be the government can discuss the sex of your
[3:39:41.760 --> 3:39:46.560]  kid and do things you don't tell them they're 12 they're in your life at age five it's goddamn
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:51.040]  pedophilia well you can have the teacher you can have a psychiatrist or you can have the parents or
[3:39:51.040 --> 3:39:55.520]  whatever telling them no i think we want to change your sex or something so if they can do that and
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:40:00.640]  the kid can make that determination at the early ages that we're seeing now then the what what they're
[3:40:00.640 --> 3:40:05.680]  setting up down the road is the idea that there is no age of consent so therefore pedophilia goes
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:12.160]  california said age of consent on vaccines is 10 yeah yeah absolutely sorry i'm david keep going david's
[3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:14.720]  here i'm sorry but another thing too craig what was we just talked about the center for medical
[3:40:14.720 --> 3:40:21.040]  progress they were charged of 15 charges of violating people's privacy because they recorded
[3:40:21.040 --> 3:40:25.920]  these interactions with people that they were doing an undercover investigation they had information
[3:40:25.920 --> 3:40:30.400]  they believed that they were butchering these kids and selling the body parts for profit so they
[3:40:30.400 --> 3:40:34.560]  did this undercover investigation released this when these people made these confessions and then
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:39.760]  of course what do we see we see them coming after the whistleblowers as always now after this was
[3:40:39.760 --> 3:40:44.560]  initially done in texas they shut it down stem said stem explain they didn't expose any private
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:47.680]  medical stuff they showed them keeping babies alive that's right what what they did was they're
[3:40:47.680 --> 3:40:52.880]  going to start a prosecution here in texas then that quietly went away because the they weren't
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:57.840]  going to push it here but now months after this is starting it back up in california and so that's
[3:40:57.840 --> 3:41:02.640]  the key thing the tape that was released yesterday a new tape the woman said well have to be careful
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:07.280]  who's in the room when i do this because we have a law here in arizona if the baby shows
[3:41:07.280 --> 3:41:11.360]  any signs of life it has to go to the hospital so i have to be careful who is in the room
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:16.240]  so that i can get an intact baby talking about how she had to do training to get stronger so she
[3:41:16.240 --> 3:41:21.600]  could rip the child up before it comes out of the mother so this is a full spectrum that goes
[3:41:21.600 --> 3:41:26.080]  from abortion to the and by the way it's come out in federal court most these top partial
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:31.040]  where the abortionists are satanists and this is in the news who could kill babies that are eight
[3:41:31.040 --> 3:41:36.000]  months old they are god they are devil worshipers so so craig i want to bring it down so is our
[3:41:36.000 --> 3:41:39.600]  back end because you've been waiting don jump back and we'll get final comments from craig here but
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:45.520]  i mean just like you can have history channel and discovery channel tv shows you can be a famous
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:50.560]  navy seal probably one of the most four or five most famous super loved by everybody the military
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:57.600]  a patriot and you can't have a you caring funding deal to make a movie about sex trafficking to expose
[3:41:57.600 --> 3:42:05.760]  it good god they can't bear it they cannot bear to be exposed they can't understand it that is their
[3:42:05.760 --> 3:42:12.000]  greatest threat we'll come back to you for final comments in a moment craig but i'm gonna i just
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:17.600]  called you back look up on the dress you want us to give i've not made out of money but i only invest
[3:42:17.600 --> 3:42:21.760]  in the truth and i can tell this is the key so ten thousand dollars was given earlier they blocked it
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:28.320]  one hundred thousand is coming now and folks that's a whole employee we could hire for the year and
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:33.040]  all their taxes and and everything it doesn't matter i'm so committed please donate to us at

[3:43:09.280 --> 3:43:14.640]  you carrying fifty thousand dollars donated an hour so they shut it down as it goes viral to help
[3:43:14.640 --> 3:43:21.840]  children and sex slavery by respected federal law enforcement officers who have worked for the cia
[3:43:22.560 --> 3:43:29.760]  navy seal seam team leaders you name it they're not credible yeah i'm with you alex these pedophiles
[3:43:29.760 --> 3:43:34.720]  are really the lowest scum of the earth and i think what mr. sloyer was doing was pretty noble
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:40.000]  and for you caring to shut it down that's inexplicable and without them giving a reason for it is even
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:45.520]  worse i i don't know what the next headline i'm going to write is maybe uh protecting pedophiles
[3:43:45.520 --> 3:43:51.840]  why is you carrying shutting down a pedophile exposing network just famous navy seal or famous
[3:43:51.840 --> 3:43:57.120]  tv host navy seal banned from uh banned from reporting on pedophiles i mean yeah yeah that
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:44:01.280]  would be a good headline too i mean something has to be done the only power i have is to write about it
[3:44:01.280 --> 3:44:06.800]  and uh you can be assured that i'm gonna exercise that power to the fullest what i don't get is is
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:11.680]  that they think this intimidates us like when they threaten me and i want to go into all of it because
[3:44:11.680 --> 3:44:18.560]  people use it against me and there's a lot of stuff behind the scenes i've had confirmed and it turns
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:24.320]  out u.s government agencies who are always being demonized are actually the ones that later confirm
[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:31.680]  this but i've i've known that i had like foreign government agencies funding private corporate
[3:44:31.680 --> 3:44:35.680]  ops against me and my family i mean i'm not bitching about it but they did stuff that was just
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:39.440]  horrible and i know craig's gone through some of the stuff might not have been might have been but
[3:44:39.440 --> 3:44:45.360]  just stuff we can't even say unless he wants to say it on air but it's like they attack you and it
[3:44:45.360 --> 3:44:53.040]  doesn't make you feel weaker it makes you actually transcend even being strong it's like a everything
[3:44:53.040 --> 3:44:58.080]  just goes quiet and then you realize you've got to make it to the end of that you've got to defeat
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:03.680]  these people because you're in a death battle they've got their hands around your throat and around
[3:45:03.680 --> 3:45:08.080]  your country's throat and they're trying to strangle you they want you to be quiet about it while they
[3:45:08.080 --> 3:45:12.800]  do it i'm like i'm not going to be quiet and then i just think about and then the people that are
[3:45:12.800 --> 3:45:17.440]  enemies i would have no satisfaction taking a meat cleaver and chopping the top of their head off
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:21.840]  because they're like like craig said they're not even people we're doing it for the innocence we're
[3:45:21.840 --> 3:45:27.360]  not doing it to crush these scumbags so david night then craig go ahead if you just look at
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:35.280]  denise hasterd for example he was the house longer than any other republican maybe longer than any
[3:45:35.280 --> 3:45:41.280]  democrat i know it was longer than any republican this guy was hand selected by power because he
[3:45:41.280 --> 3:45:45.440]  was a pedophile this was a guy who was nothing but a wrestling coach at a high school but it shows
[3:45:45.440 --> 3:45:49.920]  there's a rebellion that he was brought down yeah exactly exactly that's the other part of it it's
[3:45:49.920 --> 3:45:55.280]  a rebellion against the pedophile rule yeah yeah absolutely sorry go ahead but isn't it
[3:45:55.280 --> 3:46:00.880]  interesting that here's a guy he he's not a he's not a great thinker he's hasn't accomplished anything
[3:46:00.880 --> 3:46:05.680]  he hasn't not a great orator he's an absolute zero when he saw denise hasterd i mean look at him and
[3:46:05.680 --> 3:46:09.840]  it's like how did this guy become speaker well we found out how he became and i bet he was what he
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:15.200]  is picked because he was a pedophile women don't want him so he only feels confident screwing a
[3:46:15.200 --> 3:46:20.480]  two-year-old baby yeah but he was so they put him forward he didn't get there by strength of character
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:24.720]  accomplishments or knowledge or anything or orator i want to explain some of these pedophiles
[3:46:25.520 --> 3:46:31.120]  the sexiest thing is a big powerful woman full of life and life force that's what a man wants
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:36.320]  not a kid guys you just i don't understand i'm sorry go ahead david i'm ranting well i'm just
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:42.960]  saying that shows the power of politics who who's there and this is something that just happened
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:46.800]  they weren't talking about something happened a hundred years ago or 50 years ago this just
[3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:50.560]  happened loves her i hit he was yeah i realized i'm going all out when he was the speaker of the
[3:46:50.560 --> 3:46:55.280]  house so this is an ongoing thing this is the world that we live in and she pointed out before
[3:46:55.280 --> 3:46:59.600]  alex you know we don't struggle against flesh and blood but against spiritual wickedness in
[3:46:59.600 --> 3:47:05.920]  high places denise hastert think of denise hasterd that's the gop establishment right now that picked
[3:47:05.920 --> 3:47:11.120]  him that's the kind of guy there are kids in cages all over this country right now
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:15.520]  they hadn't seen their mommy in two years and these pedophiles line up and torture the hell out of
[3:47:15.520 --> 3:47:21.520]  them and we owe it to humanity and our species to get out of this tv trans and say no and greg
[3:47:21.520 --> 3:47:29.520]  soyer is saying no and all these other people i know trumps got military operations wiping out
[3:47:29.520 --> 3:47:34.560]  al-qaeda bases in the u.s i should even i'm just gonna say it all he's wiping them out obama is
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:39.280]  at muslim they had set up leagues they had that's why trump is just ignoring their attacks he's
[3:47:39.280 --> 3:47:45.120]  just trying to wipe out their plan before they get it up and that trump is so selfish selfless it
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:49.920]  it makes me just it is such an epic time because i've been on there 22 years i don't normally
[3:47:49.920 --> 3:47:56.400]  sit here and cry on air for five minutes the energy is so high the battle for this republic is so big
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:02.080]  this is so real people need to know there's trump gotta do something about these missing children

[3:49:35.440 --> 3:49:39.920]  so this is this is part for the course here we go we're coming we're a humble guy but we're
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:43.600]  almost skipping the break just a few more minutes of like recapping what we talked about hours ago
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:48.880]  they banjure you caring trying to do money as a discovery channel history channel you know guy
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:55.600]  that does shows you're not allowed to cover sex traveling that stuff looks bad on you caring boy
[3:49:55.600 --> 3:50:00.640]  they are looking i i still am waiting for a phone call right now i'm waiting for them to to respond
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:09.760]  and they are not they cannot articulate what their claimed discrepancy is so uh that only leaves us
[3:50:09.760 --> 3:50:17.120]  with an assumption to make about their actions which looks very very poor looks very bad this
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:21.920]  is just this is a straightforward situation they should be no no discrepancy and if it is they
[3:50:21.920 --> 3:50:26.160]  should be able to come right out with it oh yeah you know you made a typo or this needs to happen
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:31.680]  or that we could you know if they'd articulate what their discrepancy claim is we could we could
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:37.440]  address that and move on i just don't get the intimidation power of the pedo networks god they
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:44.240]  got power man paul was is that a big report coming out soon that he says is so devastating and
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:53.600]  and i can't tell everybody i just got the stuff what yeah what are you know right now i'm wondering
[3:50:53.600 --> 3:50:58.240]  what is you caring hiding from what are they hiding from that they can't answer the question
[3:50:58.240 --> 3:51:02.560]  they're they're claiming there's a discrepancy and we're saying let us know what that is we'll
[3:51:02.560 --> 3:51:08.080]  satisfy that and rage on how's that work if fifty thousand dollars an hour got donated
[3:51:08.080 --> 3:51:12.000]  they shut it off because they can see it going viral facebook twitter they all got scared it was
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:16.720]  all over the place oh my god millions are about to come in to expose pedophilia as trump is exposing it
[3:51:18.560 --> 3:51:23.920]  so then it triggers and they block you does the money people donate it go back to him or does the
[3:51:23.920 --> 3:51:31.120]  ten thousand his mother ten thousand does that go to you or what happens if i don't know i i didn't
[3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:36.160]  anticipate them just shutting down the thing after people had already donated so they'd better
[3:51:36.160 --> 3:51:42.240]  give those back to the to the don't the people that donated it or you caring would sure so we
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:47.920]  need to put a panel box how do people register mail says a record give money to vets for child
[3:51:47.920 --> 3:51:55.760]  rescue dot org how do they do it right now well um i'd sent in an email or a physical mailing
[3:51:55.760 --> 3:52:00.240]  address but i'd rather not have that on the air right now so we don't understand we weren't ready
[3:52:00.240 --> 3:52:07.040]  for that we got to get this money in now i know for sure i'll i'll sell my house i i mean i want
[3:52:07.040 --> 3:52:11.360]  to give everything i've got to this i realize now i'm sure we'll be updating the article so they can
[3:52:11.360 --> 3:52:16.240]  put that information there where where people can fund us as well as what we finally hear from you
[3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:23.120]  caring all right yeah yeah let's let's hold you caring accountable for for this their claim let's
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:28.480]  let's find out what their answer is remember two hours ago right around half ago we were talking
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:33.760]  and i said we're censored in live time and you are too what what does this say to you
[3:52:33.760 --> 3:52:39.760]  as a any terrorism federal officer i mean what does this tell you well you know i think there's a
[3:52:39.760 --> 3:52:45.680]  perfect meme for it it shows a b-17 with flak you know exploding the air all around it and says hey
[3:52:45.680 --> 3:52:50.720]  if you're taking flak you know you're over the target so if they're this if they're willing to
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:56.880]  pull this sort of desperate antique to shut up a guy who's just straightforward and trying to tell
[3:52:56.880 --> 3:53:02.320]  the truth then it looks like it's very very like i'm shooting straight for the the medulla so to
[3:53:02.320 --> 3:53:08.560]  speak in sniper talk but um i'm not going to ask but as one of you're the most elite seal teams and
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:13.520]  all the things you've done that's why they demonize veterans is why they do all this they are so scared
[3:53:13.520 --> 3:53:19.040]  before they have the robots take over and all the automation they're so scared of that last line of
[3:53:19.040 --> 3:53:25.360]  patriots men standing up for humanity and so they are absolutely crap in their pants craig
[3:53:25.360 --> 3:53:29.520]  so i know we're on we're over the target he's about both my grandfather's with the army air
[3:53:29.520 --> 3:53:33.600]  corps and one of them never talk about it because he got shot down on a bunch of other stuff but
[3:53:34.160 --> 3:53:39.840]  it was a big story but the point was the other one was a b-17 pilot a north africa bombing
[3:53:39.840 --> 3:53:45.040]  italy and then he went into italy after that and did his missions and but he just said no it was
[3:53:45.040 --> 3:53:49.440]  the craziest thing he said before i ever heard that on the news he said we see the flak clouds and
[3:53:49.440 --> 3:53:56.480]  we steer into them and and i realized that that's what you're doing what we're doing and that the
[3:53:56.480 --> 3:54:03.520]  enemy thinks we're afraid of them we're steering right into their fire yeah yeah turn the ship
[3:54:03.520 --> 3:54:08.400]  straight into that iceberg and and throttle up i mean that's that's my that's my muscle memory
[3:54:08.400 --> 3:54:13.680]  that's where i'm at i already see that they're going to suppress anything that i try to do
[3:54:13.680 --> 3:54:19.280]  you know take care of my family feed my family or make a good life for myself so um i want to go
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:24.160]  straight after what it is that uh that i care about most and right here in the continental united
[3:54:24.160 --> 3:54:29.360]  states what i can do is is help the kids man and the more i learn about it though and the more
[3:54:29.360 --> 3:54:35.920]  pervasive i learned that this pedophile thing is the more i have to be involved so here we go
[3:54:35.920 --> 3:54:40.720]  let me ask you this question in all your missions in 25 30 years in special operations
[3:54:41.840 --> 3:54:48.480]  is it for me just as a citizen as an american this is the true defense of the republic and the
[3:54:48.480 --> 3:54:56.000]  world yeah i mean is this not the most important mission ever to secure the homeland it really is
[3:54:56.000 --> 3:55:04.560]  it seems to be like this whole dark society that whatever these people are into that are involved
[3:55:04.560 --> 3:55:11.040]  pedophile activity and abuse with these rituals it seems like some really dark stuff and it seems to
[3:55:11.040 --> 3:55:17.840]  be uh the people that are in in so many cases in positions of power and have a lot of control and
[3:55:17.840 --> 3:55:22.880]  ownership of media and it just uh the people that i know that are that are neck deep in the
[3:55:22.880 --> 3:55:29.280]  investigations or even if they're not christians or or spiritual kind of people they're not looking
[3:55:29.280 --> 3:55:34.240]  at it that way they're just saying craig this is evil what we're seeing is evil this is just
[3:55:34.960 --> 3:55:39.680]  so despicable it kind of goes beyond anything uh we've seen anywhere else on the face of the
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:45.040]  planet it's interdimensional it's these people are proving themselves to be rulers of the earth to
[3:55:45.040 --> 3:55:51.840]  kill it and these these these people are let's just be frank the bible says it's fallen you know
[3:55:51.840 --> 3:55:57.280]  it's interdimensional it's a it's an anti-human outside force that's creating an army of people
[3:55:57.280 --> 3:56:01.760]  that will prove themselves to hurt children because if you'll hurt children you'll hurt anybody
[3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:08.000]  this is an army they're forging and our human army is about to defeat it uh final comments here
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:13.280]  and that's the key the human army and when i look at craig uh here and i'm concerned what you
[3:56:13.280 --> 3:56:18.800]  mentioned alex about the future with autonomous killing robots or robots that are not necessarily
[3:56:18.800 --> 3:56:23.440]  autonomous but are under the control of just one or two people instead of having human soldiers
[3:56:23.440 --> 3:56:29.040]  who have a conscience who have a mind who have a sense of right and wrong like craig soyer it's
[3:56:29.040 --> 3:56:33.280]  great that we have people like that now what i'm concerned about is the future where they
[3:56:33.280 --> 3:56:38.480]  remove so many of our troops that were the human perfect final question quick comic craig
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:42.800]  story i come back on tomorrow so big controversy no tomorrow's saturday we gotta come on sunday
[3:56:42.800 --> 3:56:46.720]  four to six p.m. you've got to come back on craig this is a big deal we can't just drop this
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:49.840]  but yeah what about how they're trying to move humans out of the decision-making process
[3:56:51.600 --> 3:56:58.080]  well i i don't have a lot to say about that other than in the marine corps i remember they were
[3:56:58.080 --> 3:57:03.440]  they pounded into us we have the responsibility to refuse to carry out an unlawful order
[3:57:03.440 --> 3:57:09.440]  and it wasn't and that was that was going to man we it was like to do righteous stuff and uh
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:14.160]  and our leaders were all about you know um to protect in the constitution and carrying out
[3:57:14.160 --> 3:57:19.680]  lawful orders from from the commander-in-chief and that we were not and that's why the left
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:24.720]  always demonize the military while they were giving in unconstitutional orders they were claiming it
[3:57:24.720 --> 3:57:28.160]  was the enemy because it was the best people we had that's right and it's not going to be
[3:57:28.160 --> 3:57:32.800]  swarms of killing drones or robots on the battlefield are not going to be doing the
[3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:36.800]  right thing they're not going to see that they've got a duty they're just going to follow commands
[3:57:36.800 --> 3:57:40.960]  seamlessly as a robot i agree don tells our quick final comment you're sitting there go
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:46.400]  ahead final comment i was just making updates to the page saying that we were terminated by
[3:57:46.400 --> 3:57:52.160]  you caring but i do plan on writing a subsequent follow-up article documenting you caring and
[3:57:52.160 --> 3:57:56.800]  calling them out for basically uh terminating this page without any explanation and also where
