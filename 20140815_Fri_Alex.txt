[00:00.000 --> 00:11.660]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.660 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:26.620]  Texas Alex Jones everything is proceeding as I have for
[00:26.620 --> 00:33.040]  Stina quote Emperor Palpatine not really hard to do
[00:33.040 --> 00:41.360]  MSNBC is demonizing anyone that doesn't basically worship the Black Panther
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.840]  Party the new Black Panther Party in Al Sharpton and trying to create racial
[00:45.840 --> 00:51.680]  division and destabilize things with the whole Ferguson situation that has now
[00:51.680 --> 00:55.960]  spread across the US as we said back on Monday it probably would people said
[00:55.960 --> 01:00.280]  stop fair-mongering no I know how this stuff works anybody who pays attention
[01:00.280 --> 01:02.800]  does
[01:03.760 --> 01:09.600]  thousands margin Times Square and other cities and other town squares across
[01:09.600 --> 01:20.760]  the country that's the Daily Mail as new evidence emerges that Michael Brown was
[01:20.760 --> 01:31.360]  a thug who had just robbed the store minutes before being shot and there
[01:31.360 --> 01:35.440]  are now reportedly witnesses black witnesses that indeed he did it did have
[01:35.440 --> 01:41.040]  the officer on the ground again it doesn't mean that police don't discriminate
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.240]  against black sometimes or that there isn't a police state in this country the
[01:46.240 --> 01:50.120]  issue is we just go where the truth is does that say it's okay that the police
[01:50.120 --> 01:55.360]  attacked reporters and shot my reporters who were running away does that mean
[01:55.360 --> 02:01.920]  it's good to have paramilitary police aiming in force at my reporters who are
[02:01.920 --> 02:07.400]  staying there with press passes with flagged microphones completely
[02:07.400 --> 02:11.760]  non-threatening no that's horrible and see this is how they're gonna sell it
[02:11.760 --> 02:18.920]  they're gonna have MSNBC come out one-sided with Al Sharpton and Obama
[02:18.920 --> 02:23.960]  and they're gonna have the other side Fox News going everyone is there for Al
[02:23.960 --> 02:29.600]  Sharpton Al Sharpton is behind this meanwhile Gateway Punnett reports it
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.920]  my reporters have taught people on the ground on live you stream we need to get
[02:33.920 --> 02:38.440]  them to go out and do it in HD everybody's saying literally to you know
[02:38.440 --> 02:43.040]  what with Obama and Al Sharpton and that this is being used to create a police
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.680]  state and that all they want is the truth and that thugs came in out of
[02:47.680 --> 02:58.200]  St. Louis using Craigslist to organize looting on the backs of protest thugs
[02:58.200 --> 03:07.600]  taking advantage of it because in thug culture that's what you do is you loot as
[03:07.600 --> 03:14.640]  your form of protest aka LA riots so you got legitimate people that just want to
[03:14.640 --> 03:19.440]  know what really happened and then you've got the police descending in and I
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.520]  said this yesterday I said if you want nationwide demonstrations and then if
[03:23.520 --> 03:28.720]  the police attacking those demonstrations nationwide looting do
[03:28.720 --> 03:32.800]  exactly what the state police with Homeland Security involved up to their
[03:32.800 --> 03:39.600]  eyeballs and the local sheriff's department are doing what they're doing
[03:39.600 --> 03:45.200]  is inciting people the militarization is provocative and the whole world is
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.520]  seeing this this looks like Tiananmen Square or something now the SWAT team
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.720]  has come out now and said they were helping the Al Jazeera and info wars
[03:53.720 --> 03:58.120]  camera people because it was Washington Post Al Jazeera info wars.com all over
[03:58.120 --> 04:05.240]  there vice was HBO was down the street and picked up one of our reporters it
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.320]  was vomiting we appreciate that and they they're singing loudspeaker turn off
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.440]  your cameras they fire tear gas rubber bullets at them and then go over and
[04:14.440 --> 04:19.960]  dismantle the cameras well there's Fox to despite reports SWAT team helped Al
[04:19.960 --> 04:26.880]  Jazeera reporters did not take their equipment that's real funny so you got
[04:26.880 --> 04:33.360]  MSNBC lion with one perspective and you've got Fox News national and local
[04:33.360 --> 04:40.040]  literally putting out Joseph Goebbels level bull and I'm just sorry I the world
[04:40.040 --> 04:44.280]  is more sophisticated folks we're gonna really look at this and really find out
[04:44.280 --> 04:48.840]  what happened and if Michael Brown's a thug and he tried to kill the cop and the
[04:48.840 --> 04:53.720]  cop killed him then you know we're gonna report that and if military police
[04:53.720 --> 04:58.400]  aim guns at us for no reason we're gonna come report it and get angry about it

[09:33.720 --> 09:38.400]  happened yesterday last night and this morning since we last talked to them when
[09:38.400 --> 09:45.520]  we signed off at about 9 30 last night we did two hours of live television out of
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.760]  the new studios that prison planet dot tv viewers were able to see we had massive
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.440]  number of folks tuning in last night and then we did 30 minutes of pre-recorded
[09:56.440 --> 10:01.680]  world news that we shot between two and seven o'clock yesterday so again in
[10:01.680 --> 10:09.560]  fours nightly news is a mix of live and also tape to air analysis or something
[10:09.560 --> 10:16.840]  else like it five nights a week seven o'clock central six o'clock eastern that
[10:16.840 --> 10:23.200]  would be of course the one eight o'clock eastern seven o'clock central and then
[10:23.200 --> 10:28.960]  six o'clock mountain five o'clock pacific we are teleprompter free radio
[10:28.960 --> 10:34.600]  and tv news here and so occasionally I will drop the ball and getting my time
[10:34.600 --> 10:42.160]  zones correct again my friends it is friday we will be back this sunday four
[10:42.160 --> 10:46.800]  to six p.m. central standard time I'm going to be working over the weekend on
[10:46.800 --> 10:52.000]  some special reports that will air during the live broadcast with david night
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.680]  and myself on this sunday edition I'm going to have a special report on geo
[10:57.680 --> 11:06.680]  engineering that is declassified on record going on worldwide the specifics
[11:06.680 --> 11:11.560]  are classified but a lot of it is now declassified and so I want to put
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.360]  together the patents and the foreign news reports and the congressional
[11:16.360 --> 11:23.720]  testimonies where they admit that our atmosphere is being manipulated towards
[11:23.720 --> 11:31.760]  what end we're not being told just like I knew the NSA had put hubs into all
[11:31.760 --> 11:36.920]  telecommunications systems by the mid-1990s and kill switches into
[11:36.920 --> 11:44.600]  everything by october 1st 2001 and total control grids to be able to
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.360]  manipulate information not just block it we told you all that because a lot of
[11:49.360 --> 11:54.560]  it was decompartmentalized and declassified but no news media would
[11:54.560 --> 12:02.440]  pick it up now everything I told you in 96 97 98 99 2000 is mainline news not
[12:02.440 --> 12:09.840]  not some of what I said exactly what we told you but just like something massive
[12:09.840 --> 12:15.760]  like that could be kept secret even as it hidden plain view the world's
[12:15.760 --> 12:24.400]  atmosphere is being assaulted and the astrophysicist the meteorologist the
[12:24.400 --> 12:30.640]  the climontologist the planetologist that we have been interviewing of of the
[12:30.640 --> 12:36.320]  year say it appears that the atmosphere is being assaulted and that they're
[12:36.320 --> 12:41.120]  attempting to destroy it they've even have in college and high school
[12:41.120 --> 12:46.520]  textbooks that we've shown on air mainline textbooks use nationwide that
[12:46.520 --> 12:53.600]  the government is spraying barium salts aluminum dioxide and other isotopes to
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.520]  quote protect the earth as a sunscreen and the reason I'm going to stay late
[12:58.520 --> 13:03.160]  today and do this special report for Sunday is I woke up this morning looked
[13:03.160 --> 13:09.480]  out the window and there were chemtrails at 5,000 feet those aren't ice crystals
[13:09.480 --> 13:14.520]  at 10,000 feet ladies and gentlemen it's about 80 degrees I went and looked it up
[13:14.520 --> 13:22.720]  at this time of year in Texas 5 to 10,000 feet some of them were at 10,000
[13:22.720 --> 13:31.200]  some at 5,000 I mean they were right over my house this is insane and while
[13:31.200 --> 13:35.080]  we're busy worried about what's happening with the police state that's been
[13:35.080 --> 13:38.840]  openly building in front of us that they've been denying exist for the last
[13:38.840 --> 13:44.760]  20 years all this other scientific tyranny medical tyranny secret death
[13:44.760 --> 13:50.600]  list for the veterans it's death panels where people that have skin cancer or
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.320]  brain cancer or lung cancer or bone cancer who are operable who you can
[13:56.320 --> 14:00.520]  save a hundred percent of the time in some cases 90% of the time in other
[14:00.520 --> 14:05.680]  cases you can look it up are being put on list to not be given care some are
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.440]  25 years old some are 80 something years old and of course when it came out
[14:10.440 --> 14:17.720]  months ago in Arizona I said it isn't just Arizona and then it turned out it
[14:17.720 --> 14:26.200]  wasn't just Arizona because it's an order I don't care if you're in the
[14:26.200 --> 14:29.040]  military you're a cop whoever you are and you think you're working for the
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.320]  system and you think you're you know overall a good person so the system must
[14:33.320 --> 14:40.600]  be good no we're going to Jacarie Jackson Joe Biggs and Josh Owens here in just a
[14:40.600 --> 14:47.400]  moment for the balance of the hour them alive open phones in the second hour but
[14:47.400 --> 14:51.320]  I want everybody to get this through their heads we live in a mind control
[14:51.320 --> 14:57.000]  echo chamber but people think that there's a choice because the globalists
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.680]  create the perception of choices famously in England that the the the two
[15:03.680 --> 15:11.640]  biggest grocery store chains are on record owned by the same family they'll
[15:11.640 --> 15:17.440]  have motor miles in major cities where most the dealerships are owned by the
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.320]  same family or the same group but they'll put different names on them and act
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.680]  like they're doing deals against each other across the street just like a Don
[15:25.680 --> 15:31.040]  King heavyweight boxing match where he owns both the fighters and they make the
[15:31.040 --> 15:40.680]  money on when they're gonna stage the knockout Fox News this is bigger than
[15:40.680 --> 15:48.400]  Ferguson it's bigger than demonstrations all over the country that the Democratic
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.240]  Party and the Justice Department are behind it's bigger than just the system
[15:54.240 --> 15:58.440]  wanting to start a civil war that I've been warning you about every day for
[15:58.440 --> 16:04.600]  months and now you see it beginning and I said watch it's gonna be race war and
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.840]  open borders because I know what the globalists are up to so when I get up
[16:09.840 --> 16:14.040]  here and I get mad at the police and I get mad at the demonstrators throwing
[16:14.040 --> 16:22.320]  rocks at them and I criticize different angles it's to get people into the
[16:22.320 --> 16:28.960]  mindset of not just going with Ford or Chevy the Dallas Cowboys or the 49ers
[16:28.960 --> 16:34.680]  it's about getting outside the box outside the Coke Pepsi box outside the
[16:34.680 --> 16:44.160]  Democrat Republican Fox News MSNBC box and actually looking at the big picture
[16:44.160 --> 16:59.560]  clearly day one the police response was a good response to looters burning down
[16:59.560 --> 17:05.920]  businesses then demonstrators come out because they don't like their town
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.160]  being occupied and being told get off the streets and guns being aimed at them
[17:10.160 --> 17:15.000]  it escalates the police shoot a bunch of reporters tear down people's cameras
[17:15.000 --> 17:20.960]  lose the moral high ground the other big issue is America knows the armored
[17:20.960 --> 17:26.240]  vehicles the helicopters the surveillance the Boston police state people know we're
[17:26.240 --> 17:30.400]  living in a tyranny the cameras people don't trust the central government it
[17:30.400 --> 17:34.600]  has a six to seven percent approval rating so the police then are on the
[17:34.600 --> 17:40.560]  ground where the rubber meets the road so the untrusting nature of the people
[17:40.560 --> 17:47.240]  for good reason is expressed onto the police and the globalists know that so
[17:47.240 --> 17:52.560]  they're planning to then submit the police due to public backlash because of
[17:52.560 --> 17:57.760]  tactics that are designed to cause a backlash to compartmentalize the police
[17:57.760 --> 18:04.400]  further into an us against them mentality so the destabilization campaign
[18:04.400 --> 18:09.280]  can roll out and so the police can be scapegoated instead of the new world
[18:09.280 --> 18:14.360]  order and the globalist so the new order in the globalist are in there training
[18:14.360 --> 18:20.160]  the police giving them the hardware the tactics of an occupying force then when
[18:20.160 --> 18:24.840]  there's a backlash against that the feds come in as the saviors while
[18:24.840 --> 18:30.960]  exacerbating the racial tensions hoping it blows up nationwide to make that the
[18:30.960 --> 18:35.360]  big issue and not the faltering economy not the banker bailouts not the open
[18:35.360 --> 18:42.240]  borders and to not have the libertarians and republican party that's moving to
[18:42.240 --> 18:46.840]  demilitarize the police de-escalate the police state they don't want that to
[18:46.840 --> 18:53.440]  happen so they want to brand it as an ow sharp and thug thug life democratic
[18:53.440 --> 19:01.480]  party pants hanging down around people's ankles knockout game poster and
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.760]  that's what Fox News is doing Al Sharpton runs it all Al Sharpton's behind the
[19:06.760 --> 19:11.920]  unrest in Ferguson the people on the ground in Ferguson on video gateway
[19:11.920 --> 19:16.440]  pundit and info wars has it are saying we hate Al Sharpton we hate Obama this is

[24:07.920 --> 24:13.880]  Alex Jones here back live on this Friday edition I tend to call things like
[24:13.880 --> 24:18.200]  Ferguson a Rosetta stone a lot of listeners know what I'm talking about
[24:18.200 --> 24:26.000]  there but the Rosetta stone for thousands of years historians philosophers
[24:26.000 --> 24:32.720]  could not read ancient hieroglyphics until they found the Rosetta stone that
[24:32.720 --> 24:38.760]  had the symbols next to the words basically so that they could then decode
[24:38.760 --> 24:44.800]  it and if you look at how they're managing this Ferguson situation in the
[24:44.800 --> 24:50.480]  media you see the divide and conquer Fox News the police are a hundred percent
[24:50.480 --> 24:56.040]  on the right the first amendments bad attacking the press is good or they're
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.520]  saying that the press was never attacked rubber bullets were not fired at the
[24:59.520 --> 25:04.320]  press none of the press was arrested Fox News there's the headline despite
[25:04.320 --> 25:09.600]  reports SWAT team helped Al Jazeera reporters did not take their equipment
[25:09.600 --> 25:16.240]  now it's coming out that Ferguson cops say Michael Brown robbed store before he
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.960]  was killed and have released HD photos from the store of the shopkeeper being
[25:21.960 --> 25:31.560]  choked and attacked by a man that looks like mr. Brown and they've released the
[25:31.560 --> 25:35.760]  report well that's good they should have done that the day after or said hey
[25:35.760 --> 25:42.280]  we're going to release evidence stop it and then not started attacking people
[25:45.160 --> 25:50.360]  but when the police shoot your reporters the rubber bullets tear gas them and
[25:50.360 --> 25:56.840]  run up and dismantle mainstream media's cameras after saying turn your cameras
[25:56.840 --> 26:02.200]  off from hundreds of yards away and then now the police have come out and said oh
[26:02.200 --> 26:07.640]  no we were helping Al Jazeera and jacari Jackson's in the video running away we
[26:07.640 --> 26:11.480]  were shooting video from behind as the flashbangs go off and the police run
[26:11.480 --> 26:20.120]  over and dismantle the cameras and they have the nerve we have them in press
[26:20.120 --> 26:25.040]  conferences again we're showing for TV viewers the side shot and the back shot
[26:25.040 --> 26:29.800]  of jacari when the flashbangs and the tear gas and then the rubber bullets come
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.280]  and then the SWAT team runs and breaks down their equipment and they're
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.560]  calling this helping them look they're helping them when the Al Jazeera
[26:39.560 --> 26:43.840]  reporter there gets hit in the face with tear gas look that's helping them I
[26:43.840 --> 26:49.680]  mean we're being fed such manifest bull there is no NSA spying if you built a
[26:49.680 --> 26:54.760]  business you didn't build that obama care cuts the price of your care 80% down
[26:54.760 --> 26:58.480]  of the cost of a phone bill raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit
[26:58.480 --> 27:04.760]  I'm sick of this level of lying whether it's Obama or the police stop it stop it
[27:04.760 --> 27:14.280]  stop it you lose the moral high ground you play into the globalist hands they've
[27:14.280 --> 27:19.800]  got Justice Department facilitators the same ones we caught sneaking around in
[27:19.800 --> 27:24.360]  Florida with the Trayvon Martin situation didn't matter of witnesses came
[27:24.360 --> 27:29.280]  out and said that Trayvon Martin was on top of Zimmerman and the truth had been
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.880]  told turns out Zimmerman's kind of a nut to running around looking for trouble
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.320]  which is what I thought it was from the start they were both out of their minds
[27:37.320 --> 27:43.880]  but the media turned it into a big race deal and the Justice Department was down
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.120]  there and the police are all dressed up in paramilitary all ready for civil war
[27:48.120 --> 27:52.920]  don't play into the federal training the feds give them this training give me
[27:52.920 --> 27:57.680]  equipment then they act like this it blows up nationwide and Obama can play
[27:57.680 --> 28:01.400]  the part of the savior with Al Sharpton and now anyone who's against reporters
[28:01.400 --> 28:05.440]  being attacked on the other side or a police state oh now we're with Al
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.840]  Sharpton see how they do that Jack Spratt could eat no fat his wife could eat
[28:09.840 --> 28:16.400]  no lean between the two they lick the platter clean full spectrum dominance
[28:16.400 --> 28:23.120]  what do you think's going on here the globalist fund and support and protect
[28:23.120 --> 28:28.720]  Al Qaeda they changed the name to IS and ISIS or ISIS to confuse everyone turn
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.640]  them loose to murder Christians and non-radical Muslims everywhere and then
[28:32.640 --> 28:37.360]  they bomb a few artillery pieces claiming Obama is trying to save a Muslim
[28:37.360 --> 28:42.480]  minority on a mountaintop no the deal was to give Al Qaeda that's what it's
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.640]  called al-Qaeda in Iraq changed their name to IS okay that's a fact that's it
[28:47.640 --> 28:52.120]  mainstream news back of the paper I'm gonna throw up the people running our
[28:52.120 --> 28:57.280]  government stir it up they send in the Justice Department now Sharpton to stir
[28:57.280 --> 29:01.680]  it up we go out there to try to okay looks like the you know feds are
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.280]  stirring this up and there's a bunch of thugs we better get out there we get
[29:05.280 --> 29:08.840]  there on the side of the police on Monday basically I'm getting criticized
[29:08.840 --> 29:13.120]  for that then the police act like total monsters
[29:14.800 --> 29:19.200]  and they're all self-righteous and I said this is gonna blow up nationwide
[29:19.200 --> 29:22.600]  what do you think you're gonna get more armored vehicles and more power out of
[29:22.600 --> 29:26.680]  people burning down cities no we're all gonna lose the country and the globalists
[29:26.680 --> 29:30.640]  are gonna use this to bring in a police state that is mainly aimed at gun owners

[33:40.760 --> 33:47.360]  got to step outside of the left-right paradigm or the Fox News MSNBC either the
[33:47.360 --> 33:51.880]  police are God and totally perfect and can do no wrong and the NSA spying is
[33:51.880 --> 33:58.720]  good and blah blah blah law and order or all the police are the devil and
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.160]  Obama will save us race bait race bait MSNBC no we've got to have a larger
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.760]  debate about why they're militarizing why we're being surveilled and the truth
[34:08.760 --> 34:12.320]  is we've been taken over by foreign banking cartels who are hardcore
[34:12.320 --> 34:19.960]  totalitarians who follow a eugenics system our reporters Josh Owens at a
[34:19.960 --> 34:28.880]  hundred feet away had them pointing M 4 2 2 3 M 16 variants at them directly at
[34:28.880 --> 34:34.080]  their camera when they were standing there on the sidewalk and the mill and
[34:34.080 --> 34:37.640]  the militarized police would march over during the day and say get back on the
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.280]  sidewalk and then later get off the sidewalk and if you don't get off the
[34:42.280 --> 34:45.720]  sidewalk I'm gonna arrest you just because they didn't like them reporting
[34:45.720 --> 34:50.320]  and then firing rubber bullets at them and then having the nerve on video
[34:50.320 --> 34:55.320]  firing tear gas rubber bullets and flashbangs running up
[34:55.320 --> 35:00.360]  dismantling the camera equipment after saying turn your cameras off chasing
[35:00.360 --> 35:06.320]  reporters down the street throwing flashbangs at the car blowing up in
[35:06.320 --> 35:11.600]  front of the car that by the way could have blown the car up Josh Owens I
[35:11.600 --> 35:15.920]  wonder I should even be asking does vice have the video with that where he's in
[35:15.920 --> 35:20.360]  the vice car vice is huge you know HBO you name it started on the internet I
[35:20.360 --> 35:24.840]  think it got bought for like a hundred million dollars by HBO the point is is
[35:24.840 --> 35:33.800]  that they're there with the explosions going off in it chasing them and then
[35:33.800 --> 35:37.920]  the cops have the nerve to go we didn't chase any reporters we were helping you
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.200]  what that's like it you see Davis or the head cops spraying them with the
[35:43.200 --> 35:49.000]  pepper spray in the face I mean was he helping them there was he the sheriff's
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.560]  department says that they thanked the officers that's right that Al Jazeera
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.400]  thanked them a spokesman for St. Charles County says that the reporters
[35:59.400 --> 36:03.480]  thanked them that's right why not say that Joe Biggs thanked you for shooting
[36:03.480 --> 36:09.400]  him with a rubber bullet rubber bullets or how about Josh when you were trying
[36:09.400 --> 36:16.480]  to blow his car up for no reason the car he was in I wonder if you see Davis
[36:16.480 --> 36:21.000]  students thank the officer that did that that's the crazy disconnect you guys
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.400]  believing your own propaganda and this is designed you're being given orders to
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.440]  make the public hate you you're being set up for a civil war that is the plan

[36:56.280 --> 37:01.040]  wars.com in Ferguson Missouri no I do not thank the police officers for first
[37:01.040 --> 37:05.240]  telling me to basically shoving me to get me out of the street and then onto
[37:05.240 --> 37:08.120]  the sidewalk and shoving me on the sidewalk I do not thank the police
[37:08.120 --> 37:11.400]  officers for telling me to turn off my cameras I do not thank the police
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.960]  officers for teargassing me I do not thank the police officers for firing
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.200]  multiple flashbang grenades at me and making me run over a fence run into a
[37:20.200 --> 37:23.640]  yard and that's when I ran into Al Jazeera and I tell you Alex I was right
[37:23.640 --> 37:26.480]  there with Al Jazeera when all this went down well they shot the rubber
[37:26.480 --> 37:31.520]  bullets at them when they lobbed the the flashbang video from behind we have it
[37:31.520 --> 37:35.760]  from the side and behind and I don't think Al Jazeera thanks them either so
[37:35.760 --> 37:39.080]  just like you said they're drinking their own Kool-Aid they're believing their
[37:39.080 --> 37:44.200]  own propaganda nobody thanks them for that situation just a few days ago well
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.720]  it discredited them and now the police chiefs come out and said it was wrong
[37:47.720 --> 37:52.560]  which is a good thing and then they ruin it all by coming back out and having the
[37:52.560 --> 37:57.960]  sheriff's department say they were thanked oh yeah it's completely ridiculous
[37:57.960 --> 38:01.240]  just like the journalists who were arrested at McDonald's you know they
[38:01.240 --> 38:05.080]  were keeping them safe they I don't know what type of justification they have to
[38:05.080 --> 38:08.840]  think that other people will believe their lies anymore just because you put
[38:08.840 --> 38:12.160]  it on a press release press release doesn't mean that everybody is going to
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.720]  agree with it some people may report it you know this is what the the sheriff's
[38:15.720 --> 38:18.680]  department or the police department said but not everybody's going to believe
[38:18.680 --> 38:22.320]  that the people here don't appreciate that I talked to the police chief last
[38:22.320 --> 38:25.840]  night he was out here walking the streets and I said you know you pretty
[38:25.840 --> 38:29.720]  much your officers out here indiscriminately shooting rubber bullets
[38:29.720 --> 38:33.000]  into a huge cloud of smoke you can't make out who's in that cloud of smoke I
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.880]  didn't see anybody with any night vision goggles they just see as a form in the
[38:36.880 --> 38:40.840]  smoke and then they just open fire and keep in mind before they even open fire
[38:40.840 --> 38:43.840]  with the rubber bullets they're firing the tear gas they're firing the flash
[38:43.840 --> 38:47.160]  banger nades and we won't talk about the rioters and the looters and that was a
[38:47.160 --> 38:51.360]  very big issue earlier in the week but the police officers were the one who
[38:51.360 --> 38:54.160]  looked right lighting the fires a couple nights ago when they're shooting out
[38:54.160 --> 38:59.600]  these flash bang grenades and the big issue is in the neighborhood shooting
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.640]  them over houses when those things are activated by fire that's again what
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.080]  burned down the branch of it in the summertime in the summertime jacquerie
[39:08.080 --> 39:12.800]  I want to read the quote that's being put out nationally and locally by Fox News
[39:12.800 --> 39:19.200]  of what the sheriff's department had to say because and we're gonna pull that up
[39:19.200 --> 39:23.840]  and put it on screen because it is just ridiculous it says despite reports SWAT
[39:23.840 --> 39:27.920]  team helped Al Jazeera did not take their equipment and then I was reading the
[39:27.920 --> 39:33.400]  quote earlier we scroll down to that it says in fact a spokesman for the St.
[39:33.400 --> 39:37.440]  Charles County Sheriff's Department says the reporters thanks their officers
[39:37.440 --> 39:42.280]  really we have video that's not true in fact last night the SWAT team officers
[39:42.280 --> 39:47.200]  were assisting the media in moving their camera equipment and media personnel
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.200]  to a safer area with their consent so they could continue to cover the event
[39:52.200 --> 39:57.080]  the sheriff's department spokesperson said ladies and gentlemen they say turn
[39:57.080 --> 40:00.920]  your cameras off turn your cameras off we have the video from multiple angles
[40:00.920 --> 40:06.040]  then they fire tear gas then they fire flash bangs then they fire rubber
[40:06.040 --> 40:11.200]  bullets and you see people being hit with it and then running and then they
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.440]  start charging you and then tear down the equipment this is the most Orwellian
[40:16.440 --> 40:21.120]  statement I've heard since Common Core said 2 plus 2 equals 5 and Obama said
[40:21.120 --> 40:25.000]  if you've got a business you didn't build that I mean I don't even want to
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.880]  attack the police here because that ties into the psychology of compacting them
[40:29.880 --> 40:35.480]  into an us against them mentality but what world do they live in to shovel
[40:35.480 --> 40:42.320]  this type of great a Bravo Sierra at us jacari yeah that's a good question Alex
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.160]  because the narrative we keep hearing you know I talked to a couple police
[40:45.160 --> 40:48.600]  officers last night including the police chief and what you keep hearing from
[40:48.600 --> 40:51.920]  these guys well I wasn't there I didn't personally give that order so I can't
[40:51.920 --> 40:55.600]  really comment on that situation so for this this sheriff or whoever this guy
[40:55.600 --> 40:59.080]  is to come out and make this statement was he there with those guys if nobody
[40:59.080 --> 41:01.920]  else seems to know what's going on because they weren't here how can you
[41:01.920 --> 41:04.800]  make a statement saying that they thank them and that they were keeping them
[41:04.800 --> 41:12.920]  safe thank you I was listening to Rob do just brought me in news articles with
[41:12.920 --> 41:18.560]  the actual statements by Al Jazeera saying they were chased attacked to their
[41:18.560 --> 41:24.560]  cars and guns were pointed at their faces until they told them thank you so
[41:24.560 --> 41:29.960]  this is like Jeffrey Dahmer making little kids thank him for raping them I
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.600]  mean I mean this is literally getting bizarre it is bizarre and like you said
[41:34.600 --> 41:38.280]  we don't want to fall into this us against them parallel because the
[41:38.280 --> 41:41.400]  officers out here the state troopers they were very well behaved last night I
[41:41.400 --> 41:44.520]  even locked up to one of the the state troopers shook his hand I said thank you
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.640]  for coming out here and being professional not coming out here with
[41:47.640 --> 41:51.640]  the heavy armor not with the guns aimed at people none of that stuff just
[41:51.640 --> 41:54.920]  standing there peacefully in the blue uniform on the sidewalk I said thank you
[41:54.920 --> 41:57.800]  for being professional so we don't want to make it us against them we want
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.480]  everybody to be held accountable whether is the officers pointing the guns the
[42:01.480 --> 42:04.800]  officers shooting people with rubber bullets or if it's the looters out here
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.160]  or the people burning down buildings everybody who was a participant in the
[42:09.160 --> 42:12.760]  violence of this needs to be held accountable and I don't want to hear just
[42:12.760 --> 42:16.040]  oh we're sorry you made a mistake we'll try to do better next time no somebody
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.120]  needs to be held accountable somebody gave that order or at least somebody
[42:19.120 --> 42:22.480]  didn't tell the guys to stop pointing the rifles at people putting red dots on
[42:22.480 --> 42:27.160]  people's chest well this is the homeland security federal training that we as
[42:27.160 --> 42:31.080]  taxpayers pay for to send these departments to these facilities this is
[42:31.080 --> 42:36.720]  standard who gave them the m-raps who gave them the L rad sound cannons who
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.600]  gave them the money for all the riot control gear and the rubber bullets and
[42:41.600 --> 42:47.720]  the flashbangs this is homeland security standardization those uniforms they were
[42:47.720 --> 42:52.200]  wearing are one of two designs departments are allowed to pick out that
[42:52.200 --> 42:57.880]  the feds pay for jacari and so this is the feds and the globalist and the ran
[42:57.880 --> 43:03.480]  corporation national stabilization force training to federalize the police
[43:03.480 --> 43:08.360]  that's been going on since the mid 90s it's declassified we've read it on air
[43:08.360 --> 43:13.840]  it's public we know more about the police state than anybody else we we're the
[43:13.840 --> 43:17.200]  operation that made four films about it we're the people been covering it since
[43:17.200 --> 43:22.480]  96 I've been the police state guy and notice now everybody's really getting
[43:22.480 --> 43:26.840]  concerned even mainline conservatives libertarians you name it wall street
[43:26.840 --> 43:33.920]  journal New York Times because we're in trouble folks this is pointed at us it's
[43:33.920 --> 43:39.080]  beyond North Korea what they've set up and we don't want it to be used against
[43:39.080 --> 43:45.040]  us it's that simple we don't want to be a mix between a Guatemala third world
[43:45.040 --> 43:49.400]  police state with a bunch of high-tech robo cop stuff meshed together I mean
[43:49.400 --> 43:54.360]  anyone with half a brain can see how serious this is now listen jacari I
[43:54.360 --> 43:58.000]  want to get into what else you witness talk to Joe Biggs and Josh Owens here in
[43:58.000 --> 44:02.400]  a moment but I know you guys got the interviews I know it's in Gateway
[44:02.400 --> 44:06.720]  pundit I need you to go out and talk to that crowd because you told me that a
[44:06.720 --> 44:10.280]  lot of folks are saying they hate Obama they hate Al Sharpton he wouldn't dare
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.240]  come down there to the crowd people told him don't come down there the media is
[44:14.240 --> 44:18.640]  making this black versus white Democrat versus Republican and and and really
[44:18.640 --> 44:21.960]  using it to make all the the predominantly black folks out there
[44:21.960 --> 44:25.920]  but a lot other white people you name it not marching in solidarity they're
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.880]  trying to make this a racial issue purely and to project the you know the
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.920]  thugs that went out and looted the first night on to free speech and trying to
[44:34.920 --> 44:38.880]  sell the police state right now and trying to get a civil war going as
[44:38.880 --> 44:42.440]  demonstrations pop up all over the country thousands marching in Times Square
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.200]  in places you know like New York where they let gangs rape women in Central
[44:46.200 --> 44:50.880]  Park and do nothing we need to get on top of this as I said a few days ago I
[44:50.880 --> 44:54.720]  need you guys to go get the interviews with folks talk cuz you know you said
[44:54.720 --> 44:57.240]  they're telling you this I know you already have some of those you're
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.160]  working very hard we need to get those videos out ASAP jacari all right well
[45:02.160 --> 45:05.840]  we'll see what we can do that many people have varying opinions out here but
[45:05.840 --> 45:08.920]  yes like you said we have encountered people who have very strong opinions
[45:08.920 --> 45:12.720]  about the way this has been handled or addressed by the supposed leaders in the
[45:12.720 --> 45:16.760]  black community well it's key to get that out cuz we're watching Fox News here
[45:16.760 --> 45:22.400]  and they're basically saying you are a new black panther which is literally
[45:22.400 --> 45:29.440]  literally as bad or worse than the Klan as bad or worse as La Raza I mean these
[45:29.440 --> 45:33.600]  guys openly say kill all the white people openly try to intimidate voters at
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.760]  voting places the new black Panther Party is horrible horrible horrible
[45:38.760 --> 45:43.160]  horrible horrible horrible horrible major Justice Department connections to
[45:43.160 --> 45:48.840]  do to then project on to black people in general you know like they use the
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.240]  Klan to project on white people we need to have these folks to cry jacari
[45:53.240 --> 45:58.640]  because they're being used in the scyop to sell the police state to be used
[45:58.640 --> 46:04.000]  first against it or city blacks and then against everyone else jacari yeah
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.880]  they're not the the black Panthers that Larry Picney was a part of many years
[46:07.880 --> 46:11.920]  ago that's exactly right well you were there covering at the fire station great
[46:11.920 --> 46:15.920]  interviews with the police chief and others before I go to Joe Biggs other
[46:15.920 --> 46:21.040]  things you've witnessed here in the last 24 hours you're card Jackson well the
[46:21.040 --> 46:24.080]  thing I want to point out to everybody what happened last night if you see the
[46:24.080 --> 46:27.960]  videos that are on info wars.com one of the videos where I talked to the the
[46:27.960 --> 46:31.240]  Marine who was out here in full uniform when people were marching up and down
[46:31.240 --> 46:34.680]  this street several thousand I don't know how many people were here by the end
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.360]  of it but at that point it's probably a two to two thousand people or so but
[46:39.360 --> 46:42.720]  notice how peacefully all these people were assembled walking up and down the
[46:42.720 --> 46:45.760]  street trying to do what they were trying to or doing what they were trying to do
[46:45.760 --> 46:49.040]  just the day before when the police have the streets blocked off on both sides
[46:49.040 --> 46:53.600]  going either way all they wanted to do was peacefully assemble walked down the
[46:53.600 --> 46:57.640]  street they went to we went to apartment complex I assume it was Michael Brown's
[46:57.640 --> 47:01.480]  apartment complex and so we had a gathering there that we went up to a
[47:01.480 --> 47:04.800]  church and then came back here to our current location outside the quick trip
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.040]  so you know just showing people you can have a peaceful rally without aiming
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.360]  guns at people's heads you don't have to do that you can stand on the side if
[47:12.360 --> 47:16.240]  you're the police and just say hey well just here here to keep the peace we're
[47:16.240 --> 47:18.880]  here to make sure the streets are relatively clear so people can pass
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.320]  through but otherwise you guys can come out here have a fun time have a safe
[47:22.320 --> 47:25.920]  time and nobody got shot last night nobody got stabbed last night you know
[47:25.920 --> 47:28.920]  you always have to have a few hotheads you want to use the colorful language
[47:28.920 --> 47:33.880]  but nobody was hurt and everything went well well jacari you said it looked like
[47:33.880 --> 47:39.520]  about 1500 last night in your report the video we're showing the video we're
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.720]  showing looks like three four thousand people this just goes on and on forever
[47:43.720 --> 47:49.480]  I mean how many people do you estimate are out there now right now it's it's
[47:49.480 --> 47:52.760]  about four or five hundred at this moment yeah the video you referenced that
[47:52.760 --> 47:56.200]  was probably earlier in the day there are definitely more people here by the
[47:56.200 --> 48:00.200]  time we left later in the evening people were driving all the way up and down the
[48:00.200 --> 48:03.520]  street just like you see now people lined up all the way down the street for
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.800]  a good mile or so and people passing through in their vehicles you know people
[48:07.800 --> 48:11.560]  honking their horns people waving their signs so yeah by the time is all finished
[48:11.560 --> 48:16.640]  we probably had several thousand much much more than 1500 for those that just
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.200]  joined us jacari Jackson in full wars calm nightly news reporter and co-host of
[48:21.200 --> 48:24.280]  this radio show is reporting live from Ferguson Missouri outside
[48:24.280 --> 48:29.400]  shane louis and jacari we're going to come back from break and talk to joe
[48:29.400 --> 48:34.440]  biggs and then of course the josh owens this is a very complex issue of you're
[48:34.440 --> 48:39.840]  a new listener we are not against the police we are not against the protesters
[48:39.840 --> 48:44.200]  we're trying to show how this is being managed by the feds we have the head of
[48:44.200 --> 48:49.440]  the black panther party in Missouri the new black panther party and no
[48:49.440 --> 48:53.120]  relation to the original black panther party that were angels compared to these
[48:53.120 --> 48:59.840]  people and incredibly racist group and organization and they're they're
[48:59.840 --> 49:04.120]  thanking Eric Holder and Eric Holder got caught stirring up the Trayvon Martin
[49:04.120 --> 49:12.080]  business so again they want to sell more military equipment and all this to the
[49:12.080 --> 49:17.160]  public and so they want to try to get riots going while acting like they're
[49:17.160 --> 49:22.400]  trying to stabilize the situation this is what Obama wants that's why the
[49:22.400 --> 49:31.840]  police should not be running around doing things that will cause a provocation
[49:31.840 --> 49:36.440]  that's why we want the citizens to not go out and have provocations with the
[49:36.440 --> 49:40.440]  police and we want the police to not be involved in provocations because this
[49:40.440 --> 49:47.120]  country is sitting on top of a mountain of dynamite politically and again they
[49:47.120 --> 49:50.400]  sell the police state to fight al-qaeda after 9-11 notice it's for the tea
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.480]  party now they sell a police state for Al Sharpton and thugs with their pants
[49:54.480 --> 49:57.520]  hanging down around their ankles then they announce it's for veterans of the
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.960]  tea party the average police I know unless they're part of special revenue
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.200]  units the truck police the DWI police you name it are generally protecting and
[50:08.200 --> 50:12.120]  serving and have tough jobs the problem is they're being federalized they're
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.880]  being given unconstitutional missions if you go to info wars.com there's a
[50:15.880 --> 50:19.800]  graphic up there the curtain memo made he makes some daily does a great job not
[50:19.800 --> 50:24.760]  just a writer it says it's always dangerous to have an army stationed
[50:24.760 --> 50:30.480]  among them over which they have no control speaking of troops being drawn
[50:30.480 --> 50:35.280]  and quartered that's Sam Adams and of course it's in the bill of rights to not
[50:35.280 --> 50:40.040]  have paramilitary on the streets it's also in the 1878 law posse commentatus
[50:40.040 --> 50:44.080]  so they just federalized the police themselves and gave them federalized
[50:44.080 --> 50:48.760]  training then when they do this the feds come in as the savers I know it's fun
[50:48.760 --> 50:53.680]  to dress up like robo-cop and everything but this doesn't intimidate the public it
[50:53.680 --> 51:01.000]  makes the public hate you I just want to explain that to the police my magic mud

[54:10.040 --> 54:15.040]  have done more on this but part of me doesn't want to give it attention we've
[54:15.040 --> 54:22.280]  had real ISIS affiliated groups threatening info wars I mean obviously
[54:22.280 --> 54:26.800]  it came out in the British news London independent that Assad the president of
[54:26.800 --> 54:31.640]  Syria reads info wars.com and that his government gets a lot of their analysis
[54:31.640 --> 54:36.880]  from it so Al Qaeda doesn't like us because they've been attacking Assad and
[54:36.880 --> 54:42.960]  I point out there a bunch of scum that they need to be dealt with I support
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.880]  airstrikes on them real airstrikes because Al Qaeda is running around
[54:47.880 --> 54:54.440]  murdering Christians and mass but that's that's how bizarre all of this has
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.360]  gotten and now Secret Service says they're aware of ISIS flag photo in
[54:58.360 --> 55:04.360]  front of the White House and ISIS has promised to blow up the White House
[55:04.360 --> 55:08.920]  yeah and Obama and his controllers aren't beyond attacking the White House
[55:08.920 --> 55:15.640]  and they'll use real jihadis that are six or seven layers fenced or sheet dipped
[55:15.640 --> 55:21.160]  they won't know but they've got real crazy jihadis it'll do it and then make
[55:21.160 --> 55:26.760]  him a hero see when it comes out our government runs Al Qaeda they'll do
[55:26.760 --> 55:31.720]  something like that we learned this years ago three years ago at Bilderberg
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.480]  and again last year one of their main topics was the world knows that Al Qaeda
[55:35.480 --> 55:41.400]  is run by the West and they are freaking out so they renamed it they're doing all
[55:41.400 --> 55:44.840]  this oh they're bombing them because they're trying to kill some Kurds on a
[55:44.840 --> 55:49.040]  mountain they're pulling a bunch of scams right now because they know our
[55:49.040 --> 55:53.680]  military knows everyone our military by the thousands officers would cover their
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.040]  faces but put out tweets in uniform saying I won't fight for Al Qaeda and
[55:57.040 --> 56:00.920]  Ron Paul and Rand Paul and others talked about it we're gonna go to break and
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.600]  come back for about 20 minutes with Joe Biggs and Josh Owens we're gonna play
[56:04.600 --> 56:07.960]  some of the clips of the interviews that Jacari and others got last night in
[56:07.960 --> 56:13.160]  Ferguson but while this crisis is going on and the borders wide open they're
[56:13.160 --> 56:16.800]  legalizing all the illegals basically by Fiat and Obama's ruling by executive
[56:16.800 --> 56:25.200]  orders this is the bombshells up on info wars.com scores of Russian trucks
[56:25.200 --> 56:30.040]  aid trucks they say the Ukraine says armored vehicles were blown up on the
[56:30.040 --> 56:35.360]  road yesterday coming out of Russia into Ukraine NATO just announced in the U.S.
[56:35.360 --> 56:40.480]  Pentagon just announced U.S. sending 600 troops armored personnel carriers and
[56:40.480 --> 56:44.400]  tanks including Abrams to countries bordering Russia to quote reassured
[56:44.400 --> 56:50.280]  threatened allies I mean ladies and gentlemen this is hard core
[56:50.920 --> 56:54.600]  George Soros bragged two months ago that he was behind the overthrow of
[56:54.600 --> 57:01.240]  Ukraine we're starting it with Russia I had Ray McGovern on two days ago who
[57:01.240 --> 57:05.280]  fought the Russians for more than two decades
[57:05.280 --> 57:10.320]  fought them high-level CIA and he says we're totally in the wrong about to
[57:10.320 --> 57:16.160]  start World War 3. George Soros is a Nazi collaborator in fact I get when
[57:16.160 --> 57:24.040]  they put him on screen I literally get angry okay so do I I mean I'm getting
[57:24.040 --> 57:28.640]  sick of this okay the globalists are setting the world on fire because they're
[57:28.640 --> 57:33.600]  gonna pose as the saviors and consolidate control and we're busy with cops and
[57:33.600 --> 57:38.640]  black people fighting with each other and then we go out there supportive of
[57:38.640 --> 57:41.680]  the police because it did look like this guy might have been a thug and there
[57:41.680 --> 57:44.760]  were a bunch of thugs burning stuff and then the police treat us like absolute
[57:44.760 --> 57:53.360]  crap what do you do when just every side is a bunch of morons I mean why is the
[57:53.360 --> 57:59.840]  public so dumb why are the police want to attack reporters and then lie about it
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.720]  Al Jazeera thanked us I have the Al Jazeera statement saying they chased
[58:03.720 --> 58:06.320]  some of their cars and pointed guns at him after shooting on rubber bullets
[58:06.320 --> 58:13.800]  that's what happened not what you say you lie and you work for the globalists
[58:13.800 --> 58:17.720]  who are pure evil and want to destroy you and your family so join the Republic
[58:17.720 --> 58:21.480]  and I know most police actually have that's why it's such a sick thing to see

[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:12.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.480]  Alex Jones
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:33.640]  Ukrainian forces destroy Russian convoy I mean this is escalated so fast that
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:36.680]  we ought to queue up the end of the Raymond Irving interview a few days ago
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.720]  where he said it ends with thermal nuclear war this is beyond the Cuban
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:47.080]  missile crisis hope and change turns to rage shooting a black youth comes amid
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:56.160]  dire social disparities my my my concern is black-on-black crime is
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.360]  anywhere on the statistics from 5 to 12 to 14 to 7 to 9 I mean the numbers all
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.240]  vary but you look up just departments own numbers black-on-black crime no one
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.200]  gets upset in Chicago when three or four black people get shot a day by black
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.640]  people and killed more than 15 a day gets shot on average look it up don't
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.480]  believe me type in how many people get shot a day in Chicago about 15 about
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.680]  three or four died a day on average during the summer it's a couple less
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.200]  during the winter and other months I mean I know these numbers I see them
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.760]  every day the numbers come across the desk here well why is no one I mean it's
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.200]  like why aren't the black people upset about 52% of blacks being aborted
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:46.200]  before they're born no they only get upset when a cop shoots a black person
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:51.120]  even if it's a black cop shooting a black person and I mean yeah the cops do
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.560]  lie about it there was someone they shoot black people in the back and then
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:59.800]  lie about it like what we saw in San Francisco and it's the lying that then
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.520]  makes the public not trust police so what are the police doing I want to ask
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:11.080]  Joe Biggs this we're gonna have Josh Owens coming up Joe this is not how you
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.760]  win the hearts and minds like we said three days ago when you first got there
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:17.240]  this is gonna escalate things now we have demonstrations nationwide them
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.600]  attacking reporters and now sure enough they're saying that the reporters thank
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:26.440]  them Al Jazeera thanks them and that they were there helping them with
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.920]  rubber bullets tear gas and flash bangs and they were there helping them with
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.920]  their equipment when they told them turn it off and dismantling I guess they
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.000]  watched him post reporter eating at McDonald's who was arrested by
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  paramilitary and slammed into the wall I guess he was being helped as well Joe
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.200]  Biggs Joe Biggs here info wars.com Ferguson Missouri I agree with you I
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:52.960]  mean I I've never heard of protect and serve in that manner you know entering
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.160]  in McDonald's and then slamming a reporter that's just that's out of this
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.240]  world that let you know that things are starting to fall apart the other day was
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.800]  just complete and total lawlessness by the police officers here I mean they
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.280]  were looking for something to do they wanted to use that equipment they had
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.840]  they got that stuff from Washington and they were itching to use every single
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:17.920]  thing that they had what would happen with your tours in Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:23.280]  if you guys acted like this well someone would probably call into one of their
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.600]  Taliban buddies and then probably within 15 to 20 minutes we'd be ambushed from
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.560]  all directions and eventually die you don't you don't you don't treat people
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.440]  like they're animals you know the other day they had everyone cornered into an
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:42.320]  area and then pointing rifles at them how do they expect people to react when
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:45.720]  there's a sniper rifle at them and a lot of people are saying all these guys are
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.120]  thugs they're thugs tell me how you would react at home if someone points a
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:54.520]  sniper rifle at you at your chest or your child how would you feel I got to be
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:59.240]  honest I mean I don't think it's good what they're doing but as a man at a
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:05.800]  primitive gut level you've got to admire people that'll throw bricks or pieces of
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.120]  brick at police when they're aiming machine guns at you I mean I mean you
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.480]  got to actually say those folks are I mean I mean that's that's pretty
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:19.480]  ballsy well one of the guys told me something he's like if you're passionate
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:24.400]  about something enough you're willing to die for it he said we're willing to die
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.960]  for the justice that we want we're willing to die so we don't have police
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.880]  brutality in our in our town anymore he's like I'm willing to take a bullet
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.200]  from one of these officers so my daughter can grow up safely so we can
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.280]  make a change to get these corrupt officers out of here yeah for those that
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.720]  don't know we're gonna come back and talk to Joe on the other side for those
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.840]  that don't know there's been a lot of allegations of police brutality and out
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:54.720]  of control behavior and the force is like 60 people only three of them are
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:00.640]  black so I think that's the big issue here we'll be right back I'm David Hall

[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:19.200]  well I tell you it's really shameful on all sides here the looters the people
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.480]  calling for killing the police the police attacking Washington Post Al Jazeera
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:30.320]  info wars dot com reporters and then coming out on Fox News today we read
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:34.600]  the statement earlier and saying they were assisting the media when they
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:40.680]  overran us and tore down the TV equipment we have HD footage from both
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:46.600]  angles they said turn your cameras off charge hundreds of yards firing attacking
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.600]  there's video of all of it from the front and back and side just absolutely
[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:59.160]  ridiculous and then separately you've got locals saying that they saw Michael
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:04.360]  Brown with his hands up being shot in the back but then other witnesses said
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.640]  there was a scuffle on the ground with the officer by the police car and it's
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:16.240]  beginning to lean towards the police at least telling the truth partially but
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.800]  how do you know that when they lie so much folks I mean Al Jazeera said they
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:25.080]  were terrified shot chased their car guns pointed at their heads after being
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:29.080]  tear gas for no reason our reporters were there and they're saying that Al
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.280]  Jazeera thanks them Al Jazeera says that is not true I mean again this is just
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.480]  getting ridiculous but this is breaking up on info wars dot com Ferguson cops say
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:45.120]  Michael Brown robbed store before he was killed and now we're seeing some of his
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:50.320]  online photos and things that will put up on screen and he looks pretty pretty
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.160]  pretty thug life ladies and gentlemen but police release surveillance video
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:03.000]  stills allegedly showing teenager choking the shopkeeper you know I love how
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.840]  thugs always robbed these chains where this shopkeeper couldn't be armed they
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.320]  don't do that to the mom and pops because we tell you I mean I could fight
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.320]  but if somebody comes in sir trying to assault me I'm not going to get in a
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:17.560]  physical altercation in my business I'm gonna pull a gun out and say get out of
[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.920]  my store and they try to assault me I'm gonna shoot them and that's why the
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:28.000]  store got torched by the thugs who put snitch on it because it the word got out
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.800]  that they dared call that the guy came in and was snatching merchandise on the
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.280]  shopkeeper tried to stop them because they get fired if they don't he began
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.880]  choking them and you know basically because he was three times bigger than
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:47.360]  the shopkeeper and again we need to post in in Watson's article the photo of
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.480]  brown that's up on drudge can we put up a punch that up right now from drudge on
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.960]  the left hand side hope and chain turns the rage and it's the whole thug life
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:04.280]  you know f you to the world attitude MSNBC's done the regular deal of trying
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.120]  to show photos of when he was younger just like with Trayvon Martin again
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:15.320]  it's all part of each side lying and manipulating as much as they can I mean
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.400]  we can get up here on air on and lie as well I don't want to do that I want to
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:27.680]  really try to find the truth so what's the final equation here the globalists
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.920]  are manipulating this whole symphony and trying to get demonstrations going
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:38.040]  nationwide so Obama can be the peacekeeper and the referee and try to
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.120]  call for calm while his surrogates Al Sharpton the just department and others
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.440]  run around stirring up as much racial animus as they can because he hasn't
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.840]  delivered to the black community he had delivered to anybody but the offshore
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.880]  globalist so all they've got's race now and black folks are turning against
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:00.600]  Obama all over the country and white folks are turning against the political
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:06.320]  system and the Rhino Republicans so what do you do you get Fox News making it
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.560]  racial making it about Al Sharpton shelling the police state that
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:14.520]  everybody's waking up to as something that's well for those black people so
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:21.080]  it's okay no it's for everybody what you do the least to me you've done to me as
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.640]  Christ said you do this to poor people you can do it to anybody so that's what's
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:40.400]  going on here okay yeah we've beeped out some of that there but
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:44.280]  that's that's the type of stuff that's going on but that's not even the real
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.600]  criticism of they're saying we're sharped in it well he's hanging out and
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:53.240]  hardly walk back doing a press conference Obama is it has his just
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:59.520]  department there stirring things up while all this is happening Ukrainian
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:07.440]  forces have destroyed a Russian convoy and are saying it was military the
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.400]  Russians are saying it was aid and the US is sending 600 troops APC's and
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:22.480]  tanks to surround the Russians to quote reassured threatened allies this is
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.480]  really cruising towards military conflict they got missile cruisers off the
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.520]  coast there in the black sea menacing the Russians so that Russia can't respond
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:36.720]  to a first nuclear strike they're trying to push the Russians in to attacking
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.440]  us we have high-level intel that's the plan we have missing nuclear weapons out
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.200]  of Dias Air Force base you notice as soon as we reported that all hell broke
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.960]  loose and they said yeah there are nukes on the east coast Al Qaeda is going to
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.440]  bomb us with them if we don't attack Syria when Syria is the opposite group
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.120]  than Al Qaeda we are under nuclear blackmail folks we don't even know the
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.960]  full extent of what's going on but it's very serious the borders are down the
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:06.440]  dollars being devalued all these wars are starting the globalists are
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:10.400]  announcing our kids belong to the state the surveillance grids out in the open
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:19.920]  the NSA spying on the Tea Party it is getting crazier by the minute and we
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:24.000]  need cooler heads that prevail and not let the next shoe to drop be race war
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.720]  burning cities and Obama calling it homeland security as the referee while
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:36.080]  his surrogate stir it all up I really wonder who they're hiring as police
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:42.920]  officers though with the with the 70 man paramilitary team with the m-raps
[01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:49.640]  they're in Ferguson oh these are for Al Qaeda first chance they get they're out
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.000]  there in people's face as soon as they pull the tanks back suddenly people
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:01.800]  stop throwing bottles I may be lucky if some guy got in your yard all muscle
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.800]  bounds and come out here I'm gonna kick your butt for no reason I guess the cops
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.040]  think we're all the type of coward that would just cower inside I mean I'm not
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.880]  looking for trouble but I don't care how big the guy is the bigger the better
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.640]  quite frankly I get I get people that when they're faced with something big
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:22.860]  and mean getting really aggressive because I tend to fight not run and that's
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:28.520]  why quite frankly I can't go to these type of events because I mean I just
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.720]  can't I mean man the cops start aiming guns at my chest when I'm standing there
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:35.400]  with a video camera and I'm not doing anything I mean they're just all
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.640]  standard for hours and they look over in the cops aiming a two to three right at
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.280]  your chest smiling at you I mean I'm telling you folks we're dead inside of
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:47.880]  that doesn't make you angry I guarantee you both my grandfathers and they
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.440]  weren't like the meanest guys in town or anything would have climbed up on top
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.400]  of an armored vehicle and beaten the hell out of that cop when World War two
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:00.200]  vets came back to Athens Tennessee and a bunch of that stuff was going on they
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.960]  attacked the city hall police station basically blew it up and the state
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.680]  police stood down the state legislature endorsed it so of course that was white
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.440]  people mainly though the battle of Athens so I mean is it different when
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:19.640]  whites march up with guns that's another issue look look at what happened when
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.160]  it was predominantly a white crowd there were some blacks and Hispanics out
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:29.000]  there at Mundy Ranch and the feds knew there were military people ready for it
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.400]  to start thank God we were there trying to de-escalate the situation but see
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:37.120]  this is where all this is going folks tender boxes at every level as a
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:41.120]  military veteran who saw a lot of combat Joe Biggs do you disagree with my
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.680]  analysis do you agree with it you're out there in Ferguson reporting live from
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.640]  the street we're gonna go out and talk to some of the crowd coming up with Dr.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.080]  Jones as well you've heard my breakdown but what's your take on what I just said
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.000]  well I completely agree you know when someone points a gun at you you're gonna
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.080]  stand up for the most part most people don't they're not gonna be oppressed
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.200]  like that you know and the funny thing is they're trying to justify and then
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.920]  complete gassing and shooting up of a town because of one glass bottle and one
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.000]  Molotov cocktail the Molotov cocktail wasn't even thrown at the police that
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.240]  landed in a on top of a car wash away from them anyways and it was out in 30
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:26.560]  minutes so they try to justify basically turning this town of Ferguson into
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.080]  Fallujah from a one bottle hitting the ground they were threatened from that
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:35.520]  and they all had guns pointed at us and yet one bottle threatened them I just
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:39.040]  don't understand that and and that's it night when they attacked everybody
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.080]  during the day you're all just standing around we have the HD video and they're
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.240]  like go to the sidewalk now get off the sidewalk search seven people and aiming
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.680]  guns at you yeah there were women and children trying to get by because they
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.080]  needed to get home there were kids that needed to get home and they were fused
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.720]  to let people by there were elderly out here there are people who are crippled
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:02.120]  with walkers and canes trying to get home because they couldn't continue
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.720]  standing out here all day and the police refused and then once the police
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.200]  decided to attack this entire town all they did was push everybody another
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.480]  mile up the road to a combat zone and putting them further away from where
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.880]  they needed to be it was complete and total unprofessionalism on the part last
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.680]  night of the Ferguson police well the fans are giving these orders it is
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.480]  always the same now to get more funding and create the perception they need all
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:33.880]  these riot police to start the Civil War job they keep doing something like
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:38.040]  this the scary part is that might happen well that's the plan it's like
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.600]  putting two roasters in a pen together yeah and you know putting knives on
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.680]  their on their feet I mean it's gonna get violent somewhere down the road and
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:52.200]  they're just all sold and ready for the Civil War which is meant to be triggered
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:57.600]  using groups that it'll be seen as acceptable but the real targets the
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:02.160]  Tea Party don't the police and military get that that's officially in the
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.920]  Pentagon plan do they really want to go up against American gun owners I hope
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.680]  not I know for the most part like I've said in the past all my friends that
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.920]  are military there's no way they would ever pick up arms against US citizens
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.040]  they're not going to infringe on people's rights so they've got to find
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.640]  some very sick twisted individuals out there to be able to do that given there
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.320]  are some but I would hope that the masses would not do that well what about
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:34.280]  what we saw in Katrina I mean they came and took the guns there yeah that was
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:39.920]  that was that was a very crazy event right there I I still can't believe
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.580]  that happened well they ran the side off it was all a test in America past the
[01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.880]  test that we're ready to be disarmed and so the new order takes that as a chance
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.600]  to advance and now they're there playing the police and the citizens off against
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.080]  each other and Obama and the globalists are sitting back laughing I want to talk
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.440]  to the crowd when we come back then some of Josh Owens what good is a big
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.160]  Berkey water filter we get that question a lot here at big Berkey water filters
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.280]  calm and in a word the answer is protection protection from water main
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.600]  breaks E. Coli contamination environmental chemical spills pesticide
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.400]  runoff chlorine taste and smell and all forms of fluoride plus big Berkey
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.040]  water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.600]  the market for a reason tested by multiple independent NSF EPA certified

[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:28.200]  camera footage well maybe they couldn't because the place was burned down but
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:34.960]  they go into the report how they got it off a digital cloud backup footage of
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:42.040]  Ferguson citizen Michael Brown reportedly choking and robbing someone in
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:54.040]  the store the store owner and see how they use this destabilization as the
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:59.320]  pretext now I mean we always had stuff like this happening before in America
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:07.320]  why do we need armored vehicles now we've got Al Sharpton the reanimated
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.800]  corpse they're stirring it all up let's go back to Joe Biggs reporting from
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.520]  forewars.com then we're gonna come back in the next segment talk briefly to
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:21.960]  Josh Owens what else is coming up Joe what else is unfolding out there I'm
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:26.920]  told the paramilitary police are gone now it's state police in blue uniforms
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:30.920]  talking to the public the police chief came out talked to folks last night we
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.000]  were able to interview him what do you expect to happen tonight are things
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.280]  starting to deescalate yeah everything's calming down quite a bit Alex right
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.320]  now like you said the police that have been here that were here last night were
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.200]  way more professional they weren't treating people like animals and when
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.000]  they gave them the right to exercise their rights as an American and
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:58.360]  everything was peaceful and fine the highway patrol was very very professional
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.600]  they did an outstanding job but I have Andrew here with me he actually got to
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:07.160]  hear the chief of the Ferguson police this morning speak what did he have to
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.200]  say well the fact that the first and police chief came down here this morning
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:17.120]  and didn't release any information on the incident report of the murder of
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.160]  Michael Brown which is the main story here and began the whole process of
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.800]  starting to blame the guy who can't stand up for himself because he's dead so
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.240]  for him to come down here it was unbelievably unprofessional and
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.280]  provocative for him to come down here and only give information which suggests
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:39.960]  we're not really going to talk about the murder right now we're going to talk
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.920]  about the fact that Mike was a regular person maybe not a perfect person but
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.480]  he's dead he has families he deserves justice and the story continues to be
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:58.440]  and needs to be the death of Michael Brown and not about wrecking him not about
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.120]  wrecking him personally he is dead and he can't speak for himself and if the
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.040]  witnesses are born out what happened a couple streets away then it is not okay
[01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:12.840]  that the police chief of Ferguson comes down here and acts like the story is that
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.640]  Michael Brown might have gotten himself into some trouble he did not deserve to
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:23.280]  be shot down like a jaw sorry but it's upsetting what do you think about the
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.960]  events that have unfolded at night time around here with the police
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.040]  department the other night were you here when they started shooting tear gas and
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:34.880]  rubber bullets into the crowd I was not here I'm from North County and happy to
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.760]  be from North County but I'm from Hazelwood it was an unbelievable over
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.800]  reaction the militarization of the zone was ridiculous it was overkill and if
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.080]  you point guns at people bad things are going to happen it's going to provoke
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:52.440]  them and upset them for obvious reasons the feds leaned in and they said pull
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.840]  out the presence and people will act like people and that's what happened all
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.120]  the feds saved us all the more unbelievable this guy's an MSNBC listener on
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:06.560]  the police chief and say don't say this kind of stuff after we finally calmed
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.040]  the community oh hold on one second I want to ask him a question ask him if
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.800]  he's aware of where the training came from that got the police to act like
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.880]  this to begin with and ask him if he knows about the police report and video
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.880]  showing purportedly Brown robbing the store I mean isn't that pertinent are
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:31.280]  you aware of where the the police got their training from no that's an
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:36.040]  unusual question for me no I'm not I'm not and what was the other question
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.800]  Alex well I mean my point is they've been federalized so the feds can play the
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:44.120]  part of the savior asking if he's aware that they've released a police report
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.320]  and video stills purportedly showing Michael Brown robbing and choking and
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:54.600]  attacking the shopkeeper are you aware that they've released some footage and
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:29:00.600]  still saying that Michael Brown actually was involved in a robbery I'm very much
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.280]  aware of that that however after several nights of violence should not be the
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.160]  main story and the fact that he came down here to launch that along with
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:15.120]  nothing literally nothing about the murder suggests that they're beginning to
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.040]  circle the wagons and suggest that it's about who Mike was it's not about who
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.120]  Mike was we all have kids we all have kids that don't that aren't always
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.080]  perfect but you know what you don't get to gun them down and there's no
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.800]  indication at this point that the police officer was chasing him down like a
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.600]  robber if he was chasing him down like a robber then why didn't he take in his
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.320]  compadre his friend who was with him at the well I agree with that if that's
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.840]  true hold on I'm gonna come in with that guy finish up talk to a few more talk

[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:48.480]  and we just put an article up on screen where it shows they were given this
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.640]  federal training they were given the armored vehicles they were taught how to
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:57.400]  aim guns at people this is what the feds do and then i just love how they gave
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:03.560]  them the costumes the armored vehicles everything and then they get to sit there
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:10.000]  and criticize it when they got predator drones flying around so the police are
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.960]  playing right into it as usual newsweek how america's police became an army the
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:22.240]  one zero three three program well that's just one small part of it i don't
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:26.000]  mean to toot my horn but i am the expert on the militarization of police
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.200]  because i've been obsessed with it since day one when i found out the police were
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:33.920]  training with the military for gun confiscation all over the country look
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:40.440]  at katrina all right let's go back to the crew there i want to get josh owens
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:43.480]  the cameraman's take on what's happened i want to talk to a few more people but
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.360]  joe bigs is there finishing up with that gentleman anything else showers that guy
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.440]  have more to say is he gone those are the else you like to say sir about what's
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:56.080]  been happening out here well in the previous nights i think it was quite
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:00.640]  obvious that the the response was disproportionate and unbelievably
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:06.480]  provocative it was i think you can put any group of people on a street and if
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:10.320]  you bring military stuff and you pointed at them and there's plenty of reports
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:14.320]  of that you're going to have a problem because people are upset and it's not a
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:18.040]  fair fight and you know what it wasn't really a fight in the first place what
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.800]  it was is people in the small community really angry that it appears that one of
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.480]  their 18 year olds about to start technical school on monday maybe not a
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:31.840]  perfect guy they're going to reveal as much as they can about him but that they
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.320]  decided that they were going to make that the story instead of investigating
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.480]  and revealing the name of the police officer which they finally done and an
[01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:46.560]  incident report which would perhaps try to explain how he was shot repeatedly
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.080]  perhaps even after he turned around and put his hands up that's why the symbol
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.160]  is hands up because nobody can believe that a professional police officer would
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:03.600]  continue shooting since that means i give up well there you have it alex words
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:13.280]  from fergus in missouri ask him if if he thinks the feds are so good i mean is he
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.840]  aware they've given the police the training nationwide and the m reps and
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:21.320]  the rest of explain that to him like are you aware that the the federal
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.160]  government actually gave the Ferguson police department those militarized
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:30.800]  vehicles those sniper rifles those m4s and the equipment the body armor to come
[01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.720]  do this oh yes absolutely as part of the surplus military program that made these
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:40.360]  things available the problem is the cover are very very serious weapons they
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.200]  tend to be provocative just by the way they look when they roll down a
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:48.200]  community street and so there needs to be appropriate training to use these
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:52.080]  vehicles and even when the feds decide you think it's okay to have that kind of
[01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:56.840]  weaponry and vehicles moving up and down to towns in america
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:01.200]  i don't even with proper training i do not think that there's much of a place
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.760]  for it at all i think it happened because there were surplus vehicles
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:08.800]  available i don't think the training has probably been proper for the use of
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.280]  them as judging by the way it went down on wednesday night when they backed off
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.160]  and treated people like human beings everything went much better but just to
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:20.920]  make the point that you know tell them alex jones the host wants to tell you
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.480]  because everybody thinks this is just by accident army surplus it's ran
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:29.320]  corporation it's public the last 30 years accelerating the last 20 it is a
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:35.880]  plan to militarize the police to have a new market for defense contractors
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.800]  domestically this is not just them getting surplus gear the the the military
[01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:47.640]  bravada the endopostic common tautus all of this is being directed as part of
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:53.160]  the tautarian takeover and alex jones wants to know do you know that this is a
[01:38:53.160 --> 01:39:00.040]  plan by our government to militarize our police nationwide well i wouldn't go so
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.160]  far as saying that's anything coordinated i think actually of course i'm
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:08.120]  confident you think it's just random i think the inability to handle weaponry
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.440]  like this is because the feds couldn't be bad hands and then clearly they're
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.600]  still afraid to even say who was calling the shots on the bad nights that we had
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.200]  here in st louis they need to say who was calling the shots because the moment
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:25.160]  the highway patrol took over reasonable heads prevailed and they said okay we
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.520]  need to back away the military equipment so do i think that the
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.600]  government's involved in a conspiracy no not particularly that this was
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.280]  incompetent at the very least do you like to get groped by the tsa when you
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.680]  go to the airport i don't know i perhaps there are
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:45.560]  necessary evils in the world um but i don't know what happened here was
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:48.120]  avoidable asking him if he thinks the state should be bigger
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:51.640]  if they hadn't decided they were going to trickle out a tiny bit of information
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:54.920]  and that information was primarily going to be about how
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:58.360]  well the guy wasn't really such a great guy asking him what his favorite tv
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.960]  network is tv news what's your favorite tv news
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:06.040]  network you watch i just watch the news
[01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:10.280]  don't give that much thought tell him if he likes mr madel msnbc
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.800]  uh cbs cnn fox any of those which ones you like
[01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:19.560]  uh cnn's not what it used to be um probably nbc i guess you like rachel
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:22.840]  madel uh yes she's fine
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.680]  yeah i don't know what that would have to do with anything really
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.520]  um i don't necessarily have a lot of opinions on people on the news i know
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:34.280]  that the last day of news was what brought me down here asking me if
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.760]  if she could be the most handsome man gq let's not start
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:42.920]  pointing fingers at people he wants to know if uh
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.920]  if you think that rachel madel could be the most handsome man in gq
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.680]  no comment no comment seems like a nice nice lady
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.760]  all right i actually saw her here yesterday i mean uh chris hayes my bad
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:41:00.120]  yeah i confused them all the time yeah well you know she's actually a great
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:05.320]  actress she plays both that's the big conspiracy
[01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.840]  all right joe hey uh let me talk to josh in just a minute okay

[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.720]  to get his take on what he's witnessed overall
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.000]  i mean i love how all these democrats and msnbc viewers
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:48.680]  i could tell that guy was a rachel madow viewer when he was talking and he
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.560]  means well that's a that's a mainline liberal
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:55.720]  has no idea how he's being gamed oh the feds aren't shipping drugs in
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:59.400]  the feds aren't you know buying armored vehicles the feds aren't preparing for
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.800]  martial law we have all the documents uh you know the feds you know didn't do
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:07.080]  secret testing on black people they're so naive
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:10.600]  they think we should have asked them but that guy was a state or federal worker
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:15.880]  they literally are like one-year-old babies that think of the state as mommy's
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:21.320]  mommy's mommy's milky i mean i'm sorry that's what this comes down to
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:25.480]  and they just think that it's a big giant mammary gland giant udders in the
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.160]  sky hanging down like romulus and remus you know
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:34.040]  suckling from it makes you want to throw up to see the gaming of these people
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:38.040]  and then meanwhile you got fox news doing the right wing gaming
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:41.000]  you know up there saying if you don't want armored vehicles and choppers in
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.120]  your neighborhood and nsa checkpoints and cameras
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.040]  you know you're you're with al sharpton i mean it is just ridiculous
[01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:51.720]  josh owens uh josh owens first in missouri
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:54.600]  sometimes when i'm standing behind the camera and i hear guys like that talk
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.280]  and some other people we've talked to out here
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.480]  all i see in my head is a marionette show and there are the manipulators pulling
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:05.240]  the strings up up above and i guess the manipulators change with the media
[01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:08.920]  the feds every person i guess is different
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:12.920]  but sometimes i mean i honestly think that guy believes there's a room
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:18.920]  a surplus room where they the the military is just having a friendly yard sale
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:22.040]  giving all their equipment to the police putting it out on the street so that
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:25.960]  they can stand right over here be in their m wraps and point guns at people
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:30.360]  and it's just i don't want to say it's funny because it's not funny but
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.800]  sometimes you can't do anything but laugh they give them federal grants that's
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:37.560]  the standard uniform they were wearing they're being federalized
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.080]  it's called the ram corporation national stability force
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:45.320]  to convert us to martial law but see i'm not a pseudo intellectual speaking
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:48.600]  with a simpering voice i just read the last
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:52.600]  nine or ten versions of that updated the plan for america
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.840]  i'm a weirdo josh i know under us code title 50
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:02.120]  they authorized lethal secret testing on the american people
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:06.280]  well right and the fact of the matter is a lot of the times these people can be
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.720]  shown the documents and they still don't see it
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:13.720]  and i mean the the proof is in the pudding we were out here
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:18.280]  we saw what happened i mean last night there were uh i read reports there were
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:21.320]  hundreds no there weren't hundreds and there weren't even a couple thousand
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.600]  there were four or five thousand people here possibly even more
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:28.680]  i mean when we were marching down the street you couldn't see the end i was
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.360]  at the front and i couldn't see the end i mean it went on for miles it looked
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.200]  like and uh there were no m wraps out here there were no guns
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:41.080]  being pointed at people and um the world isn't over
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.480]  so you see when reporters are out here they're trying to show what's going on
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:48.040]  and they say turn your cameras off because they don't want the proof of
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.480]  what they're about to do they chase people in the neighborhoods
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.240]  they shoot flashbangs at cars they shoot people with rubber bullets
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:59.080]  they send tear gas out so people are throwing up everywhere
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:03.160]  and this guy is just worried about a surplus room
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.920]  and uh frown a little little garage well sure i mean look at waco
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:10.520]  under clinton with with bradley fighting vehicles and the rest of it burning
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:13.960]  into the ground and law and horiyuchi and the rest of them out there shooting
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:18.280]  men women and children i mean they literally think oh the feds would handle
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:23.320]  it different this is federal militarized law enforcement in our face
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.240]  and again i said this back on monday we're gonna and sunday
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:30.520]  we're gonna have to hear about the feds being our savior now
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.640]  as demonstrations start up all over the country
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:37.880]  and if local police don't back down and allow this to escalate
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:41.480]  cities will burn and then obama and the globalists get what they want
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.600]  it's that simple well like we've seen from fox news all it takes is
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.200]  for uh them to come out with a story saying that
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.040]  aljazeera was being helped by the police they were shooting at them
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:58.360]  in the video that you see that jacar got they were that aljazeera was screaming
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.800]  saying stop shooting at us and but that was loving i mean
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:08.120]  they were helping them i mean how do they think they can just lie
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:11.400]  they're like turn your cameras off or we will attack turn your cameras off
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.680]  boom boom boom boom they run up and throw all their equipment down like
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.520]  actually aljazeera asked for help and we were helping them
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:22.120]  i guess because there are a lot of people that will be out here and they'll
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:25.000]  literally get shot and then they'll go see on the news that they
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.680]  know no one was shot and they'll just immediately believe it
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.200]  well that's probably the answer is just for the cops to kill everybody
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.040]  and then just say that they were helping everyone yeah exactly well i mean if
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.400]  people believe that then i mean there's there's no end
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.240]  well what about two plus two equals five i mean obama says so i mean if obama
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:47.080]  says so then it's the truth i mean you're not racist are you
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:50.920]  i don't know i might be well do folks see how they have different management
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.920]  teams right wing management teams managing that fake narrative
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:59.000]  that's dumb down and simple and then left wing management teams
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.120]  there and if you're watching us on tv there are the reporters thanking the
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:05.960]  police as they roll around the ground being hit with tear gas and rubber
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:08.760]  bullets again they're they're thanking them josh
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.400]  well by the way you're being anti police josh claiming that that that that
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:17.240]  that aljazeera didn't thank them okay i mean they're they're rolling on the
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.040]  ground like a dog rows on the ground when it wants his tummy to be rubbed
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.640]  they're just so happy that they're being shot at that they're i mean you see the
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:26.520]  aljazeera reporter he can't even talk to jacari
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:29.080]  because he's blind just like what happened to me just like what happened
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:32.040]  well were you happy when you were in the vice car the reporters car they were
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:35.320]  flashbanging you i mean obviously you need to thank them
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:38.760]  i felt extremely safe and i'm just glad that they were keeping me
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:41.960]  from leaving the area by shooting flashbangs at the car
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.480]  while i was suffocating in the car because all we all we could see in the
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.360]  headlights was red all of these now i'm sure everybody in the
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:51.240]  neighborhood too i'm sure they were really happy when they walk out the
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.880]  next morning to go to work to go to school
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.920]  and their eyes are burning from the tear gas still in the air
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:02.120]  yeah that's what big was telling me is that the next day you guys are almost
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:07.880]  vomiting out there's so much of it yeah but that's good
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:13.080]  well but either they were assisting you yeah you know what's happened i saw a

[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.840]  stupid and they get treated like they're stupid and the departments want to hire

[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:42.600]  for apd to use against us and uh i mean
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:47.400]  all other issues going on in the world uh i mean this ain't too much but i mean
[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:50.600]  i mean they're holding havoc over there just over here so yeah if you look at
[01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.240]  albuquerque we've done a lot of reports on that
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:56.200]  it's one of the most dangerous police departments out there shooting homeless
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.200]  people for no reason and then celebrating and then letting a dog attack
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.920]  the body and shooting him more to make sure he's dead
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.680]  i mean it and it just keeps happening they are so whacked out
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.560]  and it's just there's no accountability but it's the same thing with the foreign
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:12.280]  banks loading the treasury it's a nightmare
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.640]  yeah they're putting mobile cameras up everywhere but don't want their officers
[01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.920]  to have cameras on now they only want them for the public
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:22.280]  in mexico is a giant narcotics trafficking command base
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:25.880]  ironhead in washington you're on the air go ahead
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.600]  either alex i don't know how i keep on getting through the picket fence but i
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.720]  guess i'm destined the providence gets me to well you're here you're on the
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:33.400]  air go ahead sir thank you for calling
[01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:37.960]  yep right okay problem reaction solution i think it's time that all the info
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.280]  warriors throughout the planet start going
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:44.200]  identify the problem and then stay the solution maybe you could have a solution
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:47.960]  that day we just ask people to call in give a solution
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:51.880]  my solution to what's going on up and down both sides of the border
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:55.400]  on this country is what would happen if one day starting
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:00.360]  next month we had an open carry day i guarantee you there would be no problem
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:04.280]  on either side of the fence they may use it as a provocative event
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.840]  but just think about the impact that would have
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:10.360]  open carry is great because it teaches people that guns are not illegal yet
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:13.720]  they want to have the perception with all the tv shows set in new york
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:16.360]  where you're going to jail boss on you with a gun
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:19.400]  to create the perception that all our guns are illegal
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:22.680]  so it is a key thing great point what's another solution
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:25.800]  that is the solution that is the solution set that i was uh wanted to
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:28.600]  illustrate we should have more solution shows god bless you

[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:17.560]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:26.840]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:32.120]  max geysers coming up in studio also la's moving to pay people to vote they
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:35.400]  can't get all the illegals and folks to vote they already got their welfare
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:39.720]  so they're gonna pay them and give them fake driver's license
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:43.960]  oh boy well you can't protest in america unless you're an illegal
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:48.280]  uh tiffany in texas you're on the air go ahead
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:52.760]  hey alex is tiffany um i'm a prison planet dot tv and this is my second
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.800]  time calling in um i was really just calling about
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:59.000]  everything going on in berguson how outrageous it is
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000]  i see they weren't too quick to paint us out as terrorists down there when they
[02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.520]  try to militarize the situation um also i wanted to call and talk about gaza
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:11.320]  and israel kind of about what's happening there
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:14.440]  um i just think it's really crazy that they got the christian genocide and
[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.880]  then they're painting people as religious terrorists now in this state
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:21.000]  and i think that's going to be a big thing that's going to be a threat to us
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.240]  as american public so we'll see how that unfolds
[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:29.240]  well i agree with you and again it's about getting outside the box and seeing
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:32.040]  how they're playing everybody off against each other
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:36.600]  it's not choosing a side it's figuring out what what's really going on
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:40.520]  and i just can't believe we can't get these msnbc viewers to understand
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:45.160]  the feds are the ones that set this all up
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:50.440]  and they're not the saviors anything else ma'am
[02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:54.200]  i saw that he was definitely you know kind of you know shrek when you kind of
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.640]  talked to him about rachel madal and everything like that and he kind of had
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:02.440]  no negative comments which i think is kind of hard not to say
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:06.200]  god bless you ma'am i appreciate your call let's talk to kimmy in tennessee
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:12.760]  thanks for holding kimmy hi alex it's kimmy great to finally talk to you
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:17.400]  i think i wanted to talk about obama's kill your mama care today
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:21.000]  and the back to indoctrination for our kids as well
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.560]  um i just two days ago i had my seventh stroke
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:32.600]  um sorry to hear that yeah well after the first one i was on medicaid
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:36.520]  and when obama care kicked in they railroaded me and made me get off of
[02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:40.760]  a medicaid and go through our federal whatever
[02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.920]  exchange and ended up with obama care and granted they
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:48.200]  subsidized it and i don't have to pay a big monthly
[02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:51.880]  payment but my deduction deductible is so huge
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:56.680]  and yeah so your health care let's be clear went from free to costing money
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:59.720]  yes well that's a little that that's reducing
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:04.840]  that's reducing your bill because obama said so and he never lies i mean
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:10.440]  exactly well also i used to go to the best stroke hospital in the state
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:14.920]  and now i get railroaded to the hospital that has
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:19.480]  a very large police presence with dogs do you have
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:22.280]  does your family have a big history of stroke or do you know why you're having
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.600]  all these strokes i don't know i'm adopted
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:28.040]  well yeah i think it was g and i was to begin with an aspartame
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:32.520]  and floor out i quit all that and not a regular i feel
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.240]  much much better than i have in years they had me on
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:38.600]  ten different pharmaceuticals for the longest time
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.600]  and my first stroke i had time to read about gmo's
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.880]  and then i was like wait a minute and then of course it keeps on peeling away
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:49.240]  the onion skins and you find out more and more and more yeah the gmo's
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.480]  literally eat the brains of the animal lab animals that eat them
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:57.560]  and just do incredible things but yeah i look a lot of people said just create
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.680]  medicare and medicaid for everybody have it through the federal system that
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:05.320]  doesn't have it game over people already get health care before free
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:08.600]  it's just the public didn't know that they would lie and say what do you think
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:10.840]  the illegals can come here and get everything free
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:14.760]  and so they actually got rid of that for everybody through obama care
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.800]  and you had all these people going i want my free health care
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:23.080]  when it was already there and so again it's worse than socialism
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:26.360]  because now it's social engineering health care god bless you give me i'll
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:30.680]  pray for you strokes are really a scary thing
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:33.960]  i've always had like 2015 vision then it was 2020
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:38.200]  now i'm 40 and i used to could look right at the head of a pin
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:42.040]  up close and now it's just blurred blurred about right here
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:46.120]  so i'm getting old and i mean i'm just not looking forward to it
[02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:48.760]  but in the future no matter how much money you got unless you're a globalist
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:52.440]  you're not going to get health care you're going to get a death panel and
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:57.000]  well if you're against it you're racist i mean rachel madow said so and she's

[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:11.720]  you know being at the headquarters of the info wars as a
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:15.960]  transcendent event it takes me to a new place a new level you know i've been
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:18.520]  watching it for years i've been listening for years but the
[02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:23.000]  to be right here ground zero the info wars is is exciting
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.840]  i know you were running around circles yelling in the grammar room for 10 minutes
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:31.000]  my and you just landed you are turbocharged i was up at 5 a.m this morning
[02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.280]  got on the flight came right here from the airport and here i am
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:38.840]  to talk with you and to discuss all matters that need to be discussed as
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:41.320]  only you can how is london right now
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:46.200]  well as usual it's raining this is a interesting culture of people that like
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:48.840]  to live within a rain cloud and worship
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:51.720]  mushrooms that's pretty much their entire cultural
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:55.720]  bearing being here now it's about being in the sunshine
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:58.920]  and it has kind of a you know great effect on the mind because all those
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:02.200]  sun rays are coming into my brain coming into my eyes and i
[02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:05.080]  and i'm so glad to be out of london i think that's the point i'm trying to
[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:09.000]  make are you going to go native and start buying 50 caliber rifles
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.960]  i try to buy a shotgun at the airport but they said they don't sell them at the
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:14.920]  airport anymore i gotta go to the bank and they'll give you a shotgun if you
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:17.080]  open an account but no more at the airport i guess
[02:10:17.080 --> 02:10:20.200]  because that's all you know 9 11 but nevertheless
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:23.720]  uh everyone seems to have got a hat and a gun
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.280]  so um you know that's all i need i'm ready to go
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:32.360]  and and the and the texas women what what gun would you recommend for a starter
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.120]  like myself being a yankee from up north what gun is a good one to start
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:40.520]  you have a big history of firearms uh i used to i used to uh i used to do a
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:44.360]  little sharp shooting in my day i bet so so what are you into now
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.280]  personal defense i mean this would just be for something to go to the corner
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:51.800]  donut shop what would i need like a 45 caliber
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.480]  you know you know just just to get from point A to point B
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.080]  just you know for my sure sure i mean i would go with something like this shows
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.520]  up for example what do i need to blow him away that's what i'm asking you know
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:05.480]  handgun something like yeah you want something to protect yourself like a

[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.960]  you know kind of tuck deluxe i guess would become of the family of a smaller
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:19.240]  little high-powered handgun six shots five shots
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:22.600]  just something that's there but it's got the energy you need to stick right into

[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.000]  rival striped her side she's got a rifle strapped that's enough to the side
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.280]  stop it exactly this is a family show i apologize we're talking about right

[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:46.280]  look if the granddaughter of usama bin laden if god comes back and it turns

[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:55.080]  promised land that's all i'm saying we're in good shape
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:01.240]  clearly what is wrong with you man i'm here i had as you
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:05.160]  hear we're now did you hear we're now accepting bitcoin
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:09.000]  of course after after me you know banging you on the head for years and
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.440]  years and years alex finally you've seen the light about bitcoin
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.920]  and i want to take full credit for that as i as i normally do for things that
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:19.480]  i deserve full credit i think you deserve a lot of credit
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:22.840]  i think full credit i'm not fully endorsing it but people have adopted
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:26.680]  it it's working pretty good the system's coming you know on on on youtube he
[02:13:26.680 --> 02:13:30.440]  didn't mention my name which i was surprised given the fact that
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.760]  should i have added at the end of my little cupcake max kaiser
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:39.240]  as i said max kaiser what is tacy's little little nickname for you
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:43.160]  terror terror just said that's all terror
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:47.400]  here comes the terror just a tiny terror or tt for short
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:51.160]  tiny terror that's it wherever i go terror follows if i if you see me in
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.360]  your town it usually means things are going to go bad
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.040]  so when i was in athens the country went bankrupt
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.800]  i went to ireland they went belly up now that i'm here in austin
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:05.560]  i mean it doesn't portend well for this town that's why i'm thinking maybe i
[02:14:05.560 --> 02:14:08.280]  should get i don't know that's very scientific you go to the places while
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.560]  they're hot spots well there's a cause and effect here
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:14.840]  you know there's it's not the jury's still out but that's why i'm anxious to get
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:18.920]  you know a gun just in case you know because i figure
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.120]  things pop off everyone else has got a gun wait are you talking about moving to
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:25.320]  austin well uh no i mean i'm here for the next
[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.360]  few days but i mean is that a good idea should i move to austin i think you
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:33.240]  should move to austin really it's supposed to be a fantastic
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:36.840]  growth town i've heard on your show you've got a lot of growth in austin
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:40.760]  a lot of new people moving to austin but um you got a lot of people coming from
[02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.120]  all over the country we need to balance it out because i think you're getting
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:49.320]  uh some influx from uh folks that are not maybe true to the true our origins of
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.360]  austin in its its texas back well yeah i know that they've already destroyed
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:56.680]  california so they're fleeing here but then immediately start doing the same
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.680]  thing they did in california more info warriors so i would clearly be an
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:05.800]  info warrior so it helped balance out the the the migration of what's called
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.880]  non-info warriors yes i don't know though if austin's enough of a mega city for you
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:14.280]  paris london austin yeah well it the thing is growing quite rapidly so you
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:17.160]  like to get in on these things while they're you know developing
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:20.680]  take full advantage you like to get into bubbles early i like to you know the
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:24.120]  bubbles are bursting i think the bubble is i think the bubble is quite large at
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:27.320]  this point here well london is a bubble you mentioned real estate bubbles london
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:31.480]  is clearly in in a bubble uh the bond markets in a bubble stock markets are
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.840]  clearly in a bubble because these central banks they do nothing but inflate
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:38.200]  these markets with all their their free money their easy money their quantitative
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.920]  easy easy money and it does nothing except make the top of
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.560]  the pyramid very very wealthy but everyone else at the bottom of the 99.9
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.160]  percent is getting shafted the wages are going down
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:55.400]  uh job market's drying up robots are taking over so the the whole monetary
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:58.760]  policy game that they're doing now for 10 i want to look at your
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:01.720]  perspective for the world because you didn't predict her last year that you
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:05.800]  would see this dollar devaluation and and a lot of the defaults and things
[02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:11.160]  that are happening but what about blowing up convoys of of russian
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:15.000]  trucks going into ukraine today and the pentagon announcing they're sending
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.400]  the army's first brigade first cavalry with abram's tanks
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:23.080]  to the border to prepare for basically battle with the russians
[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:27.400]  like there's a pipeline that has origin in that area
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:30.520]  i know but this isn't the iraqis we're robbing now it's the russians
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:33.560]  yeah because they did they do own that pipeline i mean right you got russia
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:37.000]  iran russia iran uh are now coming together in a way
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.520]  that they would potentially supply europe with 50 of their
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:43.560]  of their gas natural gas if this pipeline is completed
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:46.840]  uh the par s i think it's uh the shorthand for this pipeline
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.080]  and of course the us and um stat arabia doesn't want that to
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:54.760]  to happen so they're going to go to war they're going to go to war in in
[02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.720]  ukraine essentially and that's why i saw arabia is now
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:01.800]  attacking iraq which really means iran
[02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:06.520]  and then our media acts like obama is bombing isis when it is literally
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:10.520]  hatched from his loins i would agree with that i mean there's a proxy war going
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.280]  on and it's all about oil so russia is basically you know i've been
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:16.840]  saying doesn't russia have the right to defend itself
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.640]  you know basically to use the line but i don't have to intellectually have any
[02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:22.760]  facts or argue with you i'm just gonna call you racist
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:27.240]  um because i'm taking out the apart a line other than the party line
[02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:32.120]  homophobe racist mass murder well you bring up a good point in that there
[02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:34.920]  are code words that are used by mass media to
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:38.040]  marginalize people before that even they get their point out
[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:41.720]  so i mean in media in this country is extremely
[02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:45.640]  monolithic there's only one view it comes from the white house and it's
[02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:49.080]  repeated over and over and over again only info wars and a few other outlets
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:53.080]  have an opposing view uh but i i hear what you're saying it's
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:56.600]  very difficult to have a debate in this country because all debate is shut down
[02:17:56.600 --> 02:18:00.760]  fox news being the primary uh sensor of
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:04.360]  non-debate debates and this guy shon hanity who
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.760]  i think is is really become the worst example of
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:12.520]  media extremism where he's off over there you know he's trying to
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.760]  dry hump netanyahu like a chihuahua dry home okay stop family show no more
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:20.200]  did you see those no more no more
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:23.640]  but let's listen i was pants you can't you pull back though and see the whole
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:27.880]  palestinian israel thing is being it is a giant manipulation as well
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:31.560]  i mean look at fox news energy resources off gaza that they have they have
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:35.560]  some gas resources off gaza as well there's also an energy element to that
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:41.080]  conflict as well and uh it's it's in occupying force israel
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:44.760]  that is you know like a bad developer with nukes
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.400]  i mean a cent you know that's what they are they're they're a developer with
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.040]  nukes so they think oh we're just going to develop we're going to build
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:52.680]  wherever we want to build we don't care what the law is you're in the way we
[02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:54.760]  are going to bomb you we'll kill you we don't care
[02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:58.520]  that that's the israel policy uh the the u.s because there
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:02.840]  is all this news but i'm not defending israel but i want to be fair here
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:05.960]  i mean a bunch of the palestinians are dragging people who don't agree with
[02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:09.800]  them around behind motorbikes and who cares about the 300 000 christians
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:13.400]  being murdered by is see if the palestinians are defending their border
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:16.280]  against mexican white white white can't the palestinians be defending their
[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:19.480]  border against israel look i know i'm not defending the border against
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:23.640]  mexicans they're bringing in all these people from central america
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:27.560]  and then paying them to vote in california i'm coming across the border
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:30.280]  okay the palestinian doesn't want people coming across the border either
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:34.440]  building illegal uh settlements on their land it's their land
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:38.760]  well i mean it does look bad when the uh when that happens
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:41.880]  well that's what i'm saying so they're defending themselves they have the right
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:44.760]  to defend themselves but see i don't even have to debate i'll just call you an
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.760]  anti-semite well semite now means terrorists
[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:51.640]  thanks to what israel has been doing according to israel's definition of
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:55.000]  anti-semitism according to israel now that means you're anti-terrorist
[02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.240]  let's be clear i'm really confused now let's be i want to talk about terrorists

[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:41.080]  this capitalism or was jeffison correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:43.880]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:46.760]  standing army ted anderson on placing a free silver dollar in a book that
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:51.560]  explains our monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:24:18.920]  it's time to understand the system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:22.440]  by the way where are the firearms i wanted the 50 cows and stuff brought in
[02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:25.480]  here 15 minutes ago let's just start bringing those in
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:29.480]  we're bringing them in they're very heavy i understand during the
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:34.200]  perseverations of max keiser max let's get serious you're in your manic
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:37.640]  phase right now i prefer to use the term light-hearted
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:41.480]  hypomanic light-hearted please thank you i understand
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:44.440]  but but let's get serious just here for a moment because i know you're a smart
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:48.360]  guy and been here a lot of virtual trading technologies
[02:24:48.360 --> 02:24:52.600]  worked with george soros son talk about soon the new while you were
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:54.280]  i want to talk about a lot of stuff with you but
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:57.640]  what do you make about the crises in the world
[02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:00.920]  intensifying secretary defense hagel two days ago said
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:05.800]  the whole world is blowing up obama three weeks ago they said that we owe him
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:11.880]  for the world being the most stable ever so obviously i agree with hagel not him
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:15.800]  there's just more and more craziness going on what do you think the grand
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:20.280]  strategy is of the technocrats or is there not a strategy because
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.120]  every analyst i have on really smart top cia people you name it
[02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:28.040]  say this is insane with russia good chances can lead to a big war nuclear
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:30.760]  war our elites are doing things that were never
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:35.080]  done before what is happening max keiser
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:42.760]  well alex you have to look at it in terms of the fact that there is now
[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.080]  a global conflict over the remaining resources
[02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:51.640]  out there energy resources and food resources and how did we come to this we
[02:25:51.640 --> 02:25:56.840]  came to this point because over the past 30 years or longer
[02:25:56.840 --> 02:26:01.480]  there's been an attempt to grow the world economy using only monetary policy
[02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:04.680]  there's been an attempt to grow the world economy simply by
[02:26:04.680 --> 02:26:11.160]  on paper bs printing money and back 40 years ago for every uh for example a
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:15.240]  dollar of debt that was generated by the united states there was
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.720]  maybe a dollar 50 or two dollars of a debt for every
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:22.920]  dollar of gdp that was roughly the equation you
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.000]  you'd create about a two dollars a debt and you get a dollar's worth of gdp
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.680]  today it takes almost 12 dollars of debt to get the same
[02:26:30.680 --> 02:26:34.680]  dollar of gdp so what does that tell you it tells you that this debt
[02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:38.680]  um you know bubble is keeps expanding and we're at the point now and it will
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:41.560]  go zimbabwe well the point the what we're at the point
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:45.400]  though that the resources that are remaining for the world and we see this
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.360]  in ukraine because ukraine is agricultural and energy resources
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:53.160]  and because the monetary stimulus to generate
[02:26:53.160 --> 02:26:58.680]  doesn't generate gdp growth anymore uh it's coming to blows it's coming to
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:02.360]  war this is this is the europe wants to absorb a snack
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:05.400]  and they want to absorb russia's gas pipelines and bases that have been
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:09.480]  there for 600 years and so there has to be i guess a war
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:13.480]  because that just belongs to george soros well look at after world world war
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.560]  world war one and world war two all that money in europe ended up going to
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:21.400]  the us uh that was for safe haven so the us
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:24.360]  inherited a tremendous billions and billions of dollars with the cash
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:29.160]  uh and they created as we all know in the 70s a petro dollar with the saudi
[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.480]  saudi arabia but now we're in an interesting inflection point where if
[02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:36.920]  i ran in russia a successful building this gas pipeline
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:42.360]  into europe they could have 50 of the gas flowing into europe very soon
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:45.800]  that would completely undermine the dollar and completely undermine the us
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:49.880]  hegemony and us post world war two strategy but this is
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:53.160]  any they're going to go to war over this but it isn't even really us it means
[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:56.600]  the corporate interests that run the us okay fine i mean you can call that as
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:00.040]  well but the corporations that represent the us corporations
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.280]  the agriculture like monsanto is a big one or the big oil companies they are
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:07.320]  now understanding that the only way that they
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.520]  can protect their position is to go to war so they're going to war i think
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:14.600]  we're on now at the beginning of a major global war
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:18.840]  over the region that's in the past been the region that
[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:22.760]  where wars have started with players that in the past have gone to war with
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:24.840]  each other so i think that's where we're at
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:30.360]  ukraine is the staging ground for this this conflict i don't lie on eyes
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:35.160]  puti put is bush called him a man who's sold he could trust
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:39.000]  but i mean russia is not offensive right now they're not stirring stuff up
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.600]  they're trying to be free market our government's trying to overthrow them
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:47.080]  messing with them and i mean they just can't bully russia like they did iraq
[02:28:47.080 --> 02:28:50.280]  or syria i just can't believe the neocons and the
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:54.760]  democrats are trying to bite something off this big
[02:28:54.760 --> 02:28:59.240]  they're delusional we know from the victoria newland tapes that
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:03.640]  e you and in the u.s. and the imf and the western forces
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:06.360]  were anxious to put in a puppet government in ukraine
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:10.840]  and they succeeded in putting in a puppet government to put the interests of
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:14.200]  these corporations like monsanto and others forward
[02:29:14.200 --> 02:29:18.360]  and the people in crimea decided they didn't want to have
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:23.880]  any more to do with this they devoted a referendum referendum to leave
[02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:27.400]  they were then subsumed by russia the people in eastern ukraine are saying
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.720]  you know they're getting bombed every day by kia
[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:32.440]  eastern ukraine looks oh i know i know they voted
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.280]  did not be part of the e you so the cia over through the country
[02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.000]  right and then now they're trying to steal the part of russia that's always
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.520]  been part of russia and their gas pipelines and where's russia been
[02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:45.240]  aggressive so far i think russia is horrible and they're
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:48.760]  racist that's why they need to be bombed nuclear

[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:46.120]  as long as i'm not the prey i'm i'm up for it
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:48.920]  see there's this you are kind of a liberal you're like a fray we're gonna
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:53.560]  hurt you with these guns the city the size of these guns i mean what do you
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:57.480]  mean i i'm from new york we don't we carry pencils and pens
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:01.000]  did you know these guns have only been used in one crime and that was when he
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:05.640]  took over the studio no no no well no the 50 caliber barrett your wife
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.920]  no no was used to rob an armored car once
[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:12.440]  really not not these guns particularly but okay
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:15.560]  lowest crime rate these guns these guns don't go out and do stuff on
[02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:18.520]  actually i think i saw these guns in that movie heat
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:22.040]  they use a similar guns to these in the famous scene where they're
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:25.640]  robbing the bank in the end i could be wrong but it's a fantastic film well we
[02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:29.240]  were able michael man directed that's what you can buy armor piercing in
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:36.200]  january yeah b-52 rear gun radar directed uh gun ammo
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:39.960]  right and take down a commercial air no arm elasia
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:43.640]  airlines no no army army surplus i wanted if i wanted something like
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:47.000]  that one of those uh they go 30 000 i bought it from the police
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.040]  supply house three dollars around instead of seven dollars around for the
[02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:55.560]  regular you can buy a book buk anti aircraft ground to missile
[02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:58.600]  air launcher here in austin i know down a commercial air

[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:06.840]  from the old rear guns they had that four of them radar directed
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:09.960]  i bought a bunch of that surplus and it's really fun we can shoot it through
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:13.240]  half inch steel when it goes the other side there's a white flash
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:16.840]  where it detonates let's say i'm trying to get it to blow up gas tanks i'm trying
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.120]  to get into a hooters restaurant and there's a big line can i use one of
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:25.000]  these to get in no you can't we we we have firearms responsibly max
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.200]  well i don't know and we're here you know like when when people are scared of
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.120]  things they shouldn't be yeah i forgot the psychology term it's where you
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:35.240]  desensitize them running i think they call it running and and and show you
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:38.600]  that it's safe they they they run it's called running the
[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:41.720]  opposite it's gonna generally kicks in and you're running as fast as you can
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:44.760]  in the opposite direction that's it you can call it psychologically you can
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:47.160]  call it anything you want but which one of these guns do you like
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:51.160]  do you like the 308 reaper you like the 223 stag arms
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:54.360]  yeah uh these are the type of guns they were aiming at our reporters for no
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:58.360]  reason all right a few days ago in fergus in missouri right and then we
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:00.600]  have a good old-fashioned this is a former state police
[02:39:00.600 --> 02:39:04.680]  texas state police gun i bought a range rifle 223
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:08.120]  this is a good little fun flanking gun right here just like a home shopping
[02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:11.800]  network kind of what you got well i mean yeah with these huge guns i mean the
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.600]  one that's closest to me seems it seems lethal but easy to use you're
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:20.840]  right that would be the choice out of all these yeah i mean i i would probably
[02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:25.240]  need uh some training for these bigger guns this one looks like any
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:28.760]  yo-yo from new york could pick up something like this and sneak into the
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:33.240]  back entrance of a movie theater and uh you know have have a crazy time
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.320]  am i right well statistically mass shootings are flat overall shootings
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:41.320]  are down 52 percent from 1992 to 2011 the latest
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:44.440]  just department numbers and they usually only do that in areas that are
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:47.800]  gun-free zones because they know there's no one there to stop them
[02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:51.000]  uh but but yes if the media hypes enough
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.480]  that crazy people uh under pentagon darpa projects
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:58.280]  you know he was in a secret pentagon darpa project
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:02.760]  under a top pentagon psychiatrist control and then he's told everyone he was a
[02:40:02.760 --> 02:40:06.920]  patsy out there in aurora colorado well the culture in texas is
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:10.760]  clearly a gun culture also in georgia in atlanta it's clearly a gun culture i
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:15.160]  mean in america i think it's it's it's hard to get laws that work coast to
[02:40:15.160 --> 02:40:17.960]  coast because it's a very very different country in different states we got a
[02:40:17.960 --> 02:40:20.920]  document cam from up top guys just all these beautiful yeah i think you need
[02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:24.200]  the total 360 but it's almost like it's like
[02:40:24.200 --> 02:40:27.960]  looking at pin-up girls these guns i mean just look at just for some although
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:31.880]  i'm not getting a hard on right now uh i will not mean that i mean like others
[02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:33.960]  and no no no it's like looking at a beautiful helicopter
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.640]  nacey i or a Mercedes we're not talking like this doesn't give me you know
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:41.400]  stop sexually stop stop you know maybe that's part of the whole texas culture
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:44.120]  i'm missing this sexual arousal that comes with these large
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:48.200]  no no no you totally missed it like fallow some i was saying that as a joke
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:52.920]  uh what about the like a lot of term for associating a fallow it is fun
[02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:56.840]  with section a thousand yards to shoot an old truck
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:02.440]  is that what you're calling your girlfriend no no no max max i'm saying
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:06.360]  you can go out to an old junk paul yeah you can sit back yeah
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  yeah fire this i'm you know a thousand yards away and hate your target and
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:14.840]  actually i am a sharpshooter on but not uh qualified on these weapons
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.400]  on a rifle rifle i can i can hit bolt action
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:22.840]  yeah remington 700 308 i can hit a target um
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:27.560]  as qualified as as a not a sniper but as what is your shooter what did you
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:32.440]  qualify out of um quantico i was on the farm for a while
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:35.800]  you know it was my background you know little government work
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:39.640]  now i'm you know working the whole media thing i think we can break that story
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:43.080]  you know you like to get those news tell me you see you were in the fbi
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:47.800]  uh we're talking about um the other place oh really
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:51.560]  i'll tell me about that max are we wait where's the music are we going to break
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:54.680]  no no no tell no no of course i exaggerate but
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:58.920]  mike i actually learned how to shoot a gun in high school that's where we were
[02:41:58.920 --> 02:42:01.960]  all taught that in gym class are you really from like a spaceship we had we
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.520]  had gym class and we had uh up in um i went to the marinac high school
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:11.960]  in new york look and we had a part of gym class you got trained on bolt action
[02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:14.920]  rifles well i just want the viewers out there to
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:18.040]  understand that these firearms are not going to sneak out of here at night and
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:22.920]  go hurt anybody no of course not because guns don't kill
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:27.080]  people people kill people that's right that's
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.760]  right ah that's right now let's get serious
[02:42:30.760 --> 02:42:36.760]  yeah max keiser what do you think about them sending tanks to the russian
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:40.440]  border of sending the army's first cavalry division
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:44.120]  to the russian border is that a good idea from the russian side
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:48.120]  no no they're deploying they've announced that the russia are ukraine
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:51.720]  the united states is sending it to multiple baltic states
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:54.840]  including ukraine and poland to the russian border right there they're
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:58.520]  they're getting ready for an insane provocation so while liberals are
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:01.800]  shaking in fear that texans have firearms and are afraid of movie
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:04.280]  theater shooters that happen you know once in a blue moon
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:08.120]  and everybody hypes up and you know our our governments
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:12.120]  mess them with people with 20 000 nuclear weapons absolutely i know
[02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:15.560]  what do i think i think that they are getting ready for
[02:43:15.560 --> 02:43:18.680]  a major conflict they're in a major conflict because the global economy is
[02:43:18.680 --> 02:43:22.360]  shrinking the u.s economy is based on what i call the
[02:43:22.360 --> 02:43:25.240]  martin gale bedding system where they have to constantly double down on
[02:43:25.240 --> 02:43:28.200]  taking over these countries even though it's a failed strategy they think that
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:30.760]  they're going to next bet it's going to be the winning bet
[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:34.360]  they think that by doing what they're doing in ukraine and moving against
[02:43:34.360 --> 02:43:38.360]  russia that somehow this is going to make all of their bond markets
[02:43:38.360 --> 02:43:41.720]  profitable at the moment so let's be clear it's the financial people that
[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:45.000]  feel insulated who just make 40 to 1 bets like
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:50.120]  corezine are delusional well think about the pentagon takes up 50 cents of
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:53.800]  every tax dollar so 1.5 trillion dollars collected in taxes last year
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:59.480]  went to the pentagon the daily gasoline spend by u.s militaries 250
[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:03.800]  million dollars i could be i might it might be
[02:44:03.800 --> 02:44:07.480]  wrong on that it might be 250 000 but it's some enormous number
[02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:11.240]  of every single day that the u.s military needs to gas up all of its
[02:44:11.240 --> 02:44:15.000]  all of its vehicles so this is an enormously
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:18.920]  cash intensive business running an empire the same thing happened
[02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:23.160]  in empires of old you run out of cash eventually and then on the margins on
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:25.960]  the periphery it starts to collapse i think that's that's what's happening in
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.200]  the u.s but i don't have to intellectually listen to what you just
[02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:30.680]  said or the historical facts backing it i can
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:34.520]  intellectually trump you by saying you're racist
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:38.920]  as i as we've said in the media space in america today there are dog whistle
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:43.240]  words that you can say to get to to stop debate if you say racist
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:47.080]  if you say homophobic etc these are dog whistle phrases that have
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:50.040]  chauvinist stop the debate and it's chauvinist
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:53.480]  and and bring out a whole uh what are some of the others
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:57.480]  two plus two equals four that's a thought crime well i mean unfortunately
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:45:01.240]  you know in this country in my opinion you don't have enough
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.640]  of what i would call a shock left i mean you have like a rush limbaugh which i
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:09.480]  think is more of a shock right and you have yourself which i would
[02:45:09.480 --> 02:45:13.080]  consider more as a in the center you know believe it or not people always
[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:16.920]  associate your show with being uh on the right but i don't think so you have
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:20.520]  a guy it's more shock libertarian but we're not trying to be shocking
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:24.280]  there's shocking stuff going on everywhere right but i mean you have guys
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:27.560]  on from um black the black panther movement i mean you
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:31.320]  ask these guys on who were in in decades previous considered to be
[02:45:31.320 --> 02:45:34.600]  shocked left the black panther movement was considered well i have the real
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.400]  black panther party on who was not about racism
[02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.360]  and he was set up and gone after instead of working for the justice
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:43.800]  department as provocateurs the new black panther right but rush limbaugh would
[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:47.400]  never have him on his show uh they know because i want to bring people together
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:51.080]  right exactly so no i know the center the establishment left wants to keep
[02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:53.800]  people on their reservation exactly the establishment right wants to keep
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:57.240]  people on their reservation then i want to really get america then you have like
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:02.040]  a rachel madow who's considered to be liberal and on the left but she's not
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:07.240]  she's she's a right wing ideologue because she'll give lip service to people
[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:11.240]  like hillary clinton who is a warmonger who is a right wing
[02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.120]  ideologue who is wants to do exactly what barack obama has done and everyone
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:19.560]  has been in the white house for the past 20 30 years on bomb countries
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:24.280]  grab assets leverage the banking system etc so there is but she has a short
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:28.840]  haircut and is arrogant therefore she's smarter than us well who so who's on
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:33.240]  the left uh there is maybe amy goodman at democracy now is actually you could
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:36.120]  say is more on the left but but doesn't get the carriage doesn't get the
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:39.640]  distribution so who is on the left in this country
[02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:43.880]  nobody i if i were in this country i would go opposite rush
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:47.640]  and i would meet him in the ratings we would both be doing
[02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:51.080]  you know whatever he gets 20 million a day in in listeners
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:55.000]  but no one in this country would ever put me on the radio against rush lumbel
[02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:58.520]  because then the entire facade would collapse well here's the thing
[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:03.480]  there isn't a market for what you're saying there isn't the internet and and
[02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:06.520]  and and and and because i would even call it left but i get your
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:11.080]  perspective limbaugh is speaking to a certain niche crowd
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:15.720]  of am listeners that were listening when he came on air when they were 60
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:20.040]  now they're 85 no i mean i'm serious and so it's well known in the radio
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:24.680]  industry that as he declines yeah it's going to be a libertarian seat
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:27.320]  that's why i've had a lot of the big execs over the years call them say yeah
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:31.960]  you'll be the next fresh limbaugh uh and of course um
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:35.480]  could very well be i mean you've got the huge audience you've got the uh well i
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:38.920]  don't even care about that i don't want to have nuclear war with the russians
[02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:45.080]  well my point is that i uh don't see any real left wing uh as opposed to london
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:47.800]  where you do have actual left-wing newspapers you know they come out and
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:50.440]  they say they're left-wing and they present a left-wing
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:54.040]  um point of view and and there's no there's nobody saying
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:57.560]  that they immediately dismissed because they are left-wing because they're on
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:01.400]  the left they're in the in the uk they have a debate here in the u.s if you if
[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:05.080]  you were to come out and say i'm left-wing the only guy you have is bernie sanders
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:09.400]  who's a socialist and he says a lot of good stuff about problem he's so looking
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:12.920]  he's that this solutions are horrible the token socialist there's one guy let
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:17.960]  him let one guy you know talk he's the token socialist but there is no actual
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:21.800]  left-wing political party in the country yeah but here's an example about so
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:25.080]  called left-wing they all think the state's gonna save them
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:27.640]  and think obama's saving them with the stuff in
[02:48:27.640 --> 02:48:30.600]  missouri right now and then the demonstration is starting all over the
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.360]  country it's the training from the feds that did this
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.120]  here's what my point of view is that both
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.800]  the right and the left on this debate about state or not state
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:46.200]  have morphed into a new debate where both the left and the right believe the
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:50.360]  market is going to save everything both the left and the right believe in the
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.600]  market fundamentalism believe in how the and this is very true of the
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:57.320]  libertarian but it would work if the market wasn't rigged
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:00.680]  right if the market was they're saying market fundamentalism
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:04.920]  while the markets rigged seven ways to sunday that's why it's a load of crap
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:08.600]  i mean don't you read market fundamentalism works if it was free market
[02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:12.840]  if if markets were allowed to operate freely they would do
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:16.040]  most of what we need to get yes yes absolutely we don't have those free
[02:49:16.040 --> 02:49:19.160]  markets and then the state comes in but the lock up people like john
[02:49:19.160 --> 02:49:22.440]  corezine when they do reckless stuff to teach people a lesson
[02:49:22.440 --> 02:49:27.480]  the token arrests here and there but no no serious jail time no serious deterrent
[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:31.240]  like in the s and l crisis of the 80s where 1500 bankers went to jail we have
[02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:34.680]  none of that we have a couple of guys like corezine and they put melamine in
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.280]  the food here nobody gets in trouble in china they execute 20 people right so
[02:49:38.280 --> 02:49:42.840]  so to round this back to what i'm saying is that i my point of view
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:48.280]  is that it's would be to look at these markets and say look they're not the
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:52.280]  the end all and be all that both the left and the right seem to think that they
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:56.120]  are and this is what we talk about on our show we challenge the orthodoxy that
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:00.520]  markets are god and as such we we don't we we don't have
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:03.320]  courage against rush limbaugh because rush limbaugh is a market
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:05.960]  fundamentalist he believes that markets are are
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:10.360]  without without fault this type of thing and this is why
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:13.800]  the dynamic has evolved the way it has people heard about me
[02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:16.120]  we're going to skip this network break go ahead
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:19.800]  he feels safer in her now i've got my i've got my
[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:22.840]  you know bulletproof straightjacket on which we're going to marketing here on
[02:50:22.840 --> 02:50:28.200]  info wars for 2999 that's 299 dollars you get yourself a bulletproof
[02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:31.080]  straightjacket and you can walk the streets of austin
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:35.160]  knowing that you can be crazy and it would stand
[02:50:35.160 --> 02:50:38.200]  around from a 50 caliber but do you know enough about the gun understand
[02:50:38.200 --> 02:50:44.280]  they're not even loaded well um if i pointed at you
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:47.560]  uh and you don't flinch then i know it's not loaded
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:51.240]  you know enough about firearms know that they're unloaded you got the safety
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.800]  off so that's worrying nope it's on safe oh okay that's good to see it i'm
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:51:00.040]  that's on fire okay all right that's okay you're getting ready to moe me down
[02:51:00.040 --> 02:51:03.400]  here it's how we instead of just going to commercial he just but so you're not
[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:07.480]  really a leftist because the leftist i'm leftist would be scared of me having a
[02:51:07.480 --> 02:51:10.600]  gun but if they saw thousands of troops in black
[02:51:10.600 --> 02:51:14.040]  uniforms they would salute it i'm anti markets which makes me a left
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:17.320]  market left of market i'm i'm fanatically anti market
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:20.840]  rigging which according to cnbc makes me a leftist
[02:51:20.840 --> 02:51:24.600]  which would make me a socialist even though in it why do you let their
[02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:27.160]  definitions define things kaiser i'm giving your
[02:51:27.160 --> 02:51:31.240]  us audience appreciation for how this debate unfolds globally in the media
[02:51:31.240 --> 02:51:33.800]  space and talking about you as being in the center
[02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:37.720]  talking about russia being in the far right rachel madow being right of center
[02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:41.560]  who believes in market fundamentalism and hillary clinton and they're being no
[02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:45.320]  left they're being no hardcore left anti market rigging
[02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:49.080]  except rick santelli on the floor of the cnbc he's a guy who comes out and
[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:52.840]  screams about how these markets are rigged but he's shot down by the panel
[02:51:52.840 --> 02:51:57.960]  on cnbc as being you know uninformed and you know they and they use various
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:03.880]  epithets to shout him down alex alex jones okay you're obviously taking a
[02:52:03.880 --> 02:52:07.400]  mental break let me just step in and take over the show this is what people

[02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.960]  i said everyone dismissed alex jones saying that martial law would appear
[02:52:57.960 --> 02:53:01.560]  in america they who's laughing now i mean you've been talking about this for
[02:53:01.560 --> 02:53:04.120]  ages that was martial law they have it ready to go
[02:53:04.120 --> 02:53:07.720]  every town across america they've got what did you think of them
[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:11.400]  attacking tv crews gassing them chasing them shooting
[02:53:11.400 --> 02:53:14.520]  them bullets and then they said the no no they thanked us
[02:53:14.520 --> 02:53:18.040]  we were helping them you know you don't see that i mean see that moscow
[02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:22.680]  that is that is 1984 level baloney well i mean that is really
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:27.800]  what where are they getting off just just like trying to act like villains
[02:53:27.800 --> 02:53:30.360]  because i don't want to demonize the police that plays into the whole deal
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:33.720]  i don't want to do that they they're obviously doing exactly what they
[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:35.720]  criticize russia and other countries are doing by
[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:39.320]  killing or attempting to kill and journalism and getting out of any
[02:53:39.320 --> 02:53:43.960]  kind of uh record of what i know but announcing turn your cameras off
[02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:47.720]  then attacking throwing the equipment around and then saying
[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:51.240]  we were helping the reporters get to a safe area they chased them down shot on
[02:53:51.240 --> 02:53:54.360]  rubber bullets flash banged their cars right well your info
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:57.160]  works at a live stream and i think one other group that's like saying ted
[02:53:57.160 --> 02:54:02.440]  bundy was trying to help those young girls he'd pick up at the shopping mall
[02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:06.200]  the hitler was trying to help the jews well that's not true
[02:54:06.200 --> 02:54:11.240]  right or netanyahu is trying to free gaza that's not well he i mean
[02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:15.000]  hamas are pretty bad guys though but you defend yourself against somebody
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:18.760]  coming into your neighborhood and building sure my issue is is that hamas
[02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:21.640]  does a lot of bad stuff as well this is in palestine have the right to defend
[02:54:21.640 --> 02:54:24.280]  itself america had to defend itself against the british you know they stage
[02:54:24.280 --> 02:54:28.440]  a revolution and insurrection i mean that the my muck will have been
[02:54:28.440 --> 02:54:31.080]  said i'm not against the palestinian people
[02:54:31.080 --> 02:54:35.160]  my point is where are they talking about isis murdering everybody
[02:54:35.160 --> 02:54:40.680]  where's the big lobby for that they just a day-to-day struggle for survival
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:44.120]  right now against the occupying force of israel that's in there just killing
[02:54:44.120 --> 02:54:48.280]  kids and babies no but they had marches in austin a few weeks ago free gaza and
[02:54:48.280 --> 02:54:51.320]  airplanes flying around saying it and then people's call me i'm going we know
[02:54:51.320 --> 02:54:56.040]  you weren't for israel law which i don't so i don't like the vitriol and like the
[02:54:56.040 --> 02:55:00.920]  holiness like like like your god or something if you say free gaza or if
[02:55:00.920 --> 02:55:03.960]  you're part of that and it's just i'm sick of the whole thing we sent a
[02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:07.400]  journalist to gaza using start join my crowdfunding site i know
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:11.160]  script tonight is her name her blog her name she just arrived there this week
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:14.280]  thanks to listeners who listen to you and listen to me on your show
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:19.320]  we crowdfunded a few a thousand dollars to send this woman to gaza to report
[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:22.280]  directly from gaza i agree with you we need more information that's why we've
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:24.520]  crowdfunded a lot of folks on about the rachel
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:28.120]  quarry story you know with the bulldozer the caterpillar bulldozer yeah i mean
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:34.280]  caterpillar bulldozer the point is though no amount of gaza worship will ever reprieve me
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:37.000]  so that i so i just need to say i fully support israel
[02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.520]  and think they should nuke the entire region and i want to attack putin as
[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:43.320]  well i want to i want to have nuclear war with russia
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:46.840]  and i want to support israel with them to nuke all the surrounding areas
[02:55:46.840 --> 02:55:50.920]  think about the fallout though from the recent uh nuclear weapons don't hurt
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:54.120]  anybody it helps all the genocide you just saw the police say that that helped
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:56.760]  everybody that the recent you just saw the police say they were helping with
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:55:59.560]  db cameras when they shot my reporter with rubber bullets
[02:55:59.560 --> 02:56:03.560]  they were helping them my reporters thank them think of the fallout we've had
[02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:07.960]  now post gaza in the professors being fired and the journalists being fired
[02:56:07.960 --> 02:56:11.480]  because they said something that was remotely challenging of israel's
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:13.560]  position i think that's reasonable arrest anyone
[02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:17.960]  that doesn't worship israel chilling of speech and i think it's wonderful
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:21.640]  well it's leading to economic collapse because if without competition you can't
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:24.600]  have a vibrant economy i actually agree with you it's very that's my big
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:28.440]  criticism of israel being serious is is also part of competition
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.200]  i don't like the israel lobby manipulating our internal politics
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:35.720]  right and because it's anti-competitive in a lot of ways and just keep on that
[02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:39.000]  theme competition is good for the economy and when you have
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:42.440]  monopolists in the banking sector and across all the other sectors monopolizing
[02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:47.560]  sure you know hamas is isis al-qaeda affiliate
[02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:51.960]  you know they're there they have a right but i mean but i mean here's the deal
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:55.880]  let's say there's two car dealerships who is who is one's forward one chevy if i
[02:56:55.880 --> 02:56:58.920]  don't like either one i'm not working for four or working for
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:02.120]  chevy if i don't buy either one do you get i don't like a lot of stuff israel
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:04.280]  does but also don't like a lot of stuff amas does
[02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:07.960]  well that's who you get where like i don't like to go to
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:11.960]  baseball or football games you're equivocating instead of taking a strong
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:14.920]  position on this no i'm pulling back you're
[02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:18.760]  seeing the big picture you're you're punting as no i'm not punting terms
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:22.360]  no i don't as a talk show host i don't plan on hardly any punting on this issue
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:25.320]  you're saying i don't i don't like anybody in the region uh they're all
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:29.320]  killing each other you get rid of the no that's called reality
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:32.280]  well as you know i'm not i was not serious when i said nuka
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:35.400]  undead that was a joke no but you're saying i'm obviously
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:38.280]  don't want war with russia either no i'm sick of it
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:42.120]  i'm sick of the both sides the israel lobby attacking me if i don't get in
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:45.560]  lockstep with them and the palestinian lobby attacking me if only lockstep with
[02:57:45.560 --> 02:57:47.880]  them i'd quite frankly i'm irritated by both groups
[02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:52.120]  and i and i'll tell you right now the the more vicious group to me
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:56.680]  making crap up and harassing me has been the hamas crowd
[02:57:56.680 --> 02:58:00.680]  and i was against invading iraq and i was like all that stuff
[02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:04.040]  so i actually care about those people over there but at the same time i'm
[02:58:04.040 --> 02:58:07.080]  tired of their dumbed-down arguments understandably that you've been put
[02:58:07.080 --> 02:58:11.400]  upon by this lopsided debate in america but the children that have been
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:15.720]  slaughtered by israel have been suffered a lot more than exactly but
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:19.720]  convenience but the cause to live on the left is only to talk about the
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:22.840]  palestinian kids not the christians having their
[02:58:22.840 --> 02:58:26.760]  throat slit by affiliated groups with hamas
[02:58:26.760 --> 02:58:30.680]  i hear that i mean i don't accuse you jingle coming in no no no that would be
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:35.800]  like that's music leading us out here that music coming max keiser dot com

[03:00:31.080 --> 03:00:34.280]  programmed from birth to the ways of the left
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:37.880]  listen here's my issue yeah we're gonna go to 20 after and take all these calls
[03:00:37.880 --> 03:00:41.960]  frank lancet and chris steven others with max keiser and i'm gonna do have you
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:44.760]  on the news and i want to take some special stuff for the sunday show coming
[03:00:44.760 --> 03:00:47.480]  up they say max keiser dot com we're gonna talk about that
[03:00:47.480 --> 03:00:49.720]  i decided we're gonna talk about it all
[03:00:49.720 --> 03:00:53.720]  no after we take calls here in a moment okay seriously
[03:00:53.720 --> 03:00:58.120]  the only anti-war thing that the left is allowed to talk about
[03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:03.240]  is worshiping the palestinians because it's a political football like abortion
[03:01:03.240 --> 03:01:08.600]  or gay marriage or whatever to to divert from the rest of the highway robbery
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:12.280]  going on and it's always a litmus test you know do you want
[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:15.480]  israel blown up well then you work for them
[03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:19.320]  if you don't want israel blown up so my issue is there's so many other things
[03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:24.120]  going on max that i'm just saying i refuse to it's like
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:28.920]  ferguson i'm not pontificating or i'm not extricating myself out of it
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:32.920]  i'm not diverting out of it when i say it's a larger manipulation
[03:01:32.920 --> 03:01:36.360]  and that both sides are doing wrong things that's really what's going on
[03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:39.560]  there there's this there's this there's this primitive thought process
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:43.240]  where people shift to one side of the other and sometimes there are things
[03:01:43.240 --> 03:01:46.520]  that clear like i'm on the side against cancer
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:50.840]  or i'm on the side against child molesters but on a lot of issues
[03:01:50.840 --> 03:01:57.560]  it is complex max geyser um it is one a conflict amongst many around the world
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:00.840]  and there's a lot of propaganda on both sides
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:07.080]  and uh in my feeling is that israel is has been manipulating the u.s government
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:11.080]  in a way that's shameless oh i agree with that they're committing acts of
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:15.880]  atrocity uh that need to be answered for but do you understand how nasty the
[03:02:15.880 --> 03:02:20.840]  anti-israel crowd is not legitimate people that have real issues but i asked
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:25.000]  the same people like shon hannity at fox news i mean if somebody showed up at
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:29.160]  his backyard and started to chop down his house and move in to his into his
[03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:32.200]  house into his backyard and take everything he owns he's i'm sure
[03:02:32.200 --> 03:02:35.960]  shon hannity would do whatever he takes to defend his property so why shouldn't
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:39.400]  that right be extended to people in palestine people in gaza who are having
[03:02:39.400 --> 03:02:45.240]  their territory removed over the decades uh similarly so what
[03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:48.120]  we're showing on that point nowhere he goes over well that's
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:52.600]  i mean that's it though the israelis went into the country
[03:02:52.600 --> 03:02:57.000]  in the 40s after world war two they carved it out
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  they started blowing up government buildings and then they got the city
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:04.280]  basically divided and got part of it and then took over and have been expanding
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:07.160]  ever since so yes but from their perspective
[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:10.920]  they had the land before so it's theirs but from the palestinian perspective
[03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:14.440]  they had it before and the truth is well the rule of law
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:18.600]  goes back to the 19 resolution 181 in the un
[03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:21.960]  which divide the palestine from israel 1947
[03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:26.200]  1947 1948 you had the modern state of israel according to the rule of law
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:29.480]  uh this is where we mark the beginning of
[03:03:29.480 --> 03:03:33.080]  modern israel and we don't go refer back to the old testament or these other
[03:03:33.080 --> 03:03:37.000]  documents we say this is the post-war reality the situation
[03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:40.760]  and in that context they have gone into these territories
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:45.800]  illegally and they have imposed restrictions that you'd have to go back
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:48.440]  to nazi germany to find something similar by
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:51.960]  giving palestinians calorie counts on every single day by blocking their
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:55.080]  movements or keeping them essentially in a concentration camp in open-air prison
[03:03:55.080 --> 03:03:58.120]  sounds like the michelle obama lunch program
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:03.240]  well i mean coming back to the u.s you see a lot of these
[03:04:03.240 --> 03:04:08.520]  ugly truths in the u.s ferguson be an example the same forces that are driving
[03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:13.480]  this occupation in gaza from a well-armed well-financed israel
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:17.160]  are driving these incidents in some places like ferguson
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:21.160]  which are driven by the corporate agenda corporate media the same victims
[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:25.240]  you know the people in ferguson that who are being victimized by the sudden
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:28.920]  martial law being declared spontaneously and having the military show up
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:32.760]  on his announce essentially in just a small town with 21 000 inhabitants
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:35.720]  they've got essentially a militia ready to roll out at a moment's

[03:09:25.800 --> 03:09:29.720]  hello alex max uh i also watch your show
[03:09:29.720 --> 03:09:36.040]  um i'm calling in Omaha nebraska and i
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:41.320]  early in the morning uh wednesday morning
[03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:48.520]  or yesterday morning uh i saw a report on yahoo news and they're saying that
[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:53.320]  everything okay there's much chaos going on a whole bunch of people throwing
[03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:58.760]  molotov cocktails and all chaos was breaking loose so that the
[03:09:58.760 --> 03:10:03.320]  police force had to go in and disperse the rioters
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:07.080]  and then later i watched your show and it was like
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:11.240]  opposite of what they said well there was one bottle thrown in one mall off
[03:10:11.240 --> 03:10:14.120]  throne but very lethargically and we've caught
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:17.080]  the feds before staging things it may have been real
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:20.440]  the point is bringing all the force out attacking the reporters
[03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:24.600]  helped escalate it all and this just illustrates the police state we're
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:27.480]  you know getting in this country i mean remember they denied the nsa was
[03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:32.840]  listening to us but there were problems on both sides
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:36.120]  but i guess you what do you call that you call that
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:39.880]  punting for me to just say both sides it's equivocating i think is i don't
[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:43.400]  think it's equivocation to not take a side that was not in context with this
[03:10:43.400 --> 03:10:46.600]  question i mean you know but it's the same thing now
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:50.440]  you're teleporting now i'm catapulting with teleportation
[03:10:50.440 --> 03:10:53.560]  you're you're but let's get to the so the caller here's a point i think is
[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:56.600]  interesting to make when when they when the cops showed up in military gear
[03:10:56.600 --> 03:11:00.280]  it it made the violence worse the next day they showed up in cop gear
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:04.200]  and people were a lot calmer so they're they're very presence in this military
[03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:08.440]  militarization of the police is inciting riots is inciting violence
[03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:11.320]  yeah imagine if foreign armies landed like this and we're doing this people
[03:11:11.320 --> 03:11:13.960]  go crazy right is that the point of of wearing the military
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:17.000]  garb is it to put down the violence or is it to incite violence because they
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.960]  incited a lot of violence the next day they show up in regular cop gear
[03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:23.480]  and suddenly people were a lot calmer i think there's a good point a good
[03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:26.280]  question there well seems like they want in
[03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:29.720]  violence to ensue because as you point out you're shown how to agree with you
[03:11:29.720 --> 03:11:34.040]  there's there's a need to get people to buy into a lot of violence that needs to
[03:11:34.040 --> 03:11:37.560]  be put down and therefore authorizing more militarization more spending of
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:41.160]  militarization of the police and to bring in more martial law
[03:11:41.160 --> 03:11:46.200]  well if you look at the video of the man that was shot he's a big guy michael
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:49.160]  brown i've seen the video now it's up on info wars
[03:11:49.160 --> 03:11:53.880]  dot com i mean he went in there slowly wanted to ransacked you know
[03:11:53.880 --> 03:11:58.440]  attack the shopkeeper and that's why we have guns
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:01.800]  right but have you noticed the thugs always attack places but look let's
[03:12:01.800 --> 03:12:04.360]  put it in a broader perspective you know you had a big rap sheet i'm not going
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:07.480]  to say that this would apply specifically to this case but if you
[03:12:07.480 --> 03:12:10.680]  look at the broader economy people are really suffering from this i know but
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:13.640]  i'm we don't know what really happened with the shooting and i think it's sad
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:18.280]  if it was wrong the point is is that the people looting isn't a good response
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:21.080]  and then the police attacking reporters isn't a good response
[03:12:21.080 --> 03:12:24.280]  it's like everyone's acting like a bunch of jerks is my point right i mean
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:28.040]  here's the thing why didn't america act like this previously if this is so
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:31.320]  normal and so good max because the economy is shrinking
[03:12:31.320 --> 03:12:34.440]  because the economy is collapsing that's why they're the same thing in london
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:37.880]  the mayor just ordered four water cannons and he said that he expects
[03:12:37.880 --> 03:12:41.160]  riots this summer we've also got a hundred million people on welfare in this
[03:12:41.160 --> 03:12:43.800]  country and a lot of people are just lazy dumb
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:47.640]  down moron the opportunities are not there because all that wealth's been
[03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:50.440]  forced into the precipice of the very very
[03:12:50.440 --> 03:12:54.280]  oh i agree so those opportunities are not there it's not people are not
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:58.120]  being on welfare is not easy alex it's it's it's incredibly demeaning
[03:12:58.120 --> 03:13:02.920]  and it's incredibly uh intervene but if you're on corporate welfare like uh
[03:13:02.920 --> 03:13:07.160]  jp morrigan halliburton we're on the same page buddy you know they're taking
[03:13:07.160 --> 03:13:10.920]  all that free cash uh then they're sucking it up the economy
[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:13.320]  frank frank what's your bottom line you're saying you saw two different
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:16.920]  things watching the feed you read one thing saw another
[03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:20.040]  uh i mean i've i've looked at i think our reporting is the closest to the truth
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:23.640]  you're gonna find it's live it's on the ground there's hours of it every day
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:26.280]  i mean you can just decide for yourself what do you think of that
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:30.360]  anything i didn't mention anything about reporters being attacked or nothing and
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:33.000]  then after i watched your show i came back later
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:38.440]  and they took it off completely they had a completely different story posted
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:43.960]  in its place that censorship right after they found out that
[03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:48.040]  the it got leaked that the media was attacked
[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:51.720]  it changed their story interesting i appreciate your call frank well look
[03:13:51.720 --> 03:13:56.360]  washington post reporter uh a black guy got attacked and suddenly
[03:13:56.360 --> 03:14:00.280]  there were flowers and rainbows coming out of those militarized police
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:03.720]  buttholes they'll stop it over backwards to make this look like
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:07.240]  nothing was going wrong you see i'm saying once a once a washington post
[03:14:07.240 --> 03:14:10.840]  journalists was revealed that suddenly they got the word up
[03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:15.400]  from up high you know change everything we're getting national attention which
[03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:19.720]  this is no longer just a local example of us beating people up for no reason
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:23.080]  and everything changed in a heartbeat this is what happened this is what the
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:26.760]  caller is pointing out no i i'm i'm aware of what you're saying
[03:14:26.760 --> 03:14:30.440]  and that's the psi op them coming out now and saying they were helping everyone
[03:14:30.440 --> 03:14:33.960]  yeah when they were shooting our reporters yep for no reason
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:38.600]  it just shows the training they're getting from the feds this is federalized
[03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:42.200]  standard training the vehicles all of it came from the feds the uniforms all of
[03:14:42.200 --> 03:14:44.920]  it and it's because they're getting ready for
[03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:49.000]  martial law they're getting ready to take the pension funds
[03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.800]  and they're getting ready to use the giant welfare class that doesn't want to
[03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:56.440]  tie their shoelaces as the detonator to blow the country sky high max
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:00.520]  they've disenfranchised tens of millions if not a hundred million people
[03:15:00.520 --> 03:15:04.040]  in america who are it was very interesting when this attack went down
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:07.080]  remember what the police in the bullhorn was saying we are not
[03:15:07.080 --> 03:15:11.320]  upsetting your right to assemble as they attacked as they were screaming and
[03:15:11.320 --> 03:15:13.880]  this is very important to me because i've always said
[03:15:13.880 --> 03:15:17.080]  that the surveillance state would justify it they say if you have nothing
[03:15:17.080 --> 03:15:19.640]  to hide you have nothing to worry about i've always said
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:23.160]  the problem is not privacy and whether i'm hiding anything or not what i want
[03:15:23.160 --> 03:15:26.760]  and cherish in this country is the right to assemble the right to plan a
[03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:29.800]  counter attack you know if their tyrants take over the
[03:15:29.800 --> 03:15:33.400]  white house no that's it and and these are technologies used to bring in the
[03:15:33.400 --> 03:15:36.680]  ultimate tyranny they always do they don't want assembly they don't want
[03:15:36.680 --> 03:15:40.520]  people coming together to plan some kind of reaction to what is
[03:15:40.520 --> 03:15:45.160]  obviously a takeover by a police state and this is it was amazing to me that
[03:15:45.160 --> 03:15:48.840]  when the police got on the truck and with the bullhorn said we are not
[03:15:48.840 --> 03:15:52.120]  disturbing your right to assemble which is of course incredible max you
[03:15:52.120 --> 03:15:55.320]  understand the final piece of the equation
[03:15:55.320 --> 03:15:58.760]  they plan on us being us against them in a war with the police
[03:15:58.760 --> 03:16:02.920]  we've got to stop the civil war let them know it's part of a larger trap
[03:16:02.920 --> 03:16:06.280]  and try to educate them instead of playing into what the global is
[03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:09.480]  wanting i mean it's about financial sovereignty and
[03:16:09.480 --> 03:16:11.800]  financial independence as we've been saying on your show for a year
[03:16:11.800 --> 03:16:15.400]  look at how the police have been joining in idly and in spain and greece have
[03:16:15.400 --> 03:16:18.760]  been joining the protesters well you have cops on your show often how is that
[03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:21.880]  going are the cops in your opinion based on who you have
[03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:25.080]  conversations are the police in this country more
[03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:28.920]  um aware of the dynamic they are more aware in the general public
[03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:32.920]  that's that's why this is such a paradox is that they're a great hope
[03:16:32.920 --> 03:16:36.520]  they're also a great problem yeah that's why there's a tug of war
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:40.680]  between the globalist and the people to get the police to be
[03:16:40.680 --> 03:16:45.720]  good well in spain i think also or in well in spain and then in ukraine of
[03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:48.120]  course people are defecting the military is defecting
[03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:51.880]  to russia so therefore you have the orders come down from Kiev to take a
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:54.360]  stand against russia the more the military is defecting
[03:16:54.360 --> 03:16:57.160]  and over there in the russian border they've got thousands of passports are
[03:16:57.160 --> 03:17:00.520]  just handing them out like candy like hey come on over this is water it's great
[03:17:00.520 --> 03:17:05.080]  over here come on welcome so it's it's it's an incredible
[03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:08.920]  example of how stupid america's foreign policy is they're provoking
[03:17:08.920 --> 03:17:13.240]  russia into nobody likes a bully that's why israel was liked at first because
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:16.840]  israel was being attacked when like seven nations were gang up on them
[03:17:16.840 --> 03:17:19.960]  but then when it's a little kid throwing rocks at a tank and he gets shot
[03:17:19.960 --> 03:17:23.880]  or israeli bulldozer running over someone that's wrong
[03:17:23.880 --> 03:17:28.440]  and then you talk about it in the israel lobby attacks you israel is a victim
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:32.600]  also in that they've lost the moral high ground that any pretense at a moral
[03:17:32.600 --> 03:17:35.240]  high ground that they may have had up until this recent gaza
[03:17:35.240 --> 03:17:39.480]  incursion and now their brand if you will of israel has been shattered
[03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:43.560]  irreparably and the same thing for america
[03:17:43.560 --> 03:17:46.360]  around the country around the world on this show we've talked about it because
[03:17:46.360 --> 03:17:50.600]  i do reports all over the world and the idea of america as a beacon of hope and
[03:17:50.600 --> 03:17:53.160]  and freedom has now been completely shattered with it
[03:17:53.160 --> 03:17:56.680]  yeah we're losing the moral high ground and we need to stop that oh we're
[03:17:56.680 --> 03:17:59.640]  going to skip this network break go to the bottom of the hour max keiser

[03:18:37.080 --> 03:18:40.920]  realize what these people are doing to all of us
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:45.560]  it's not just some of us it's all of us we have got to get together
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:49.320]  and get the people around us to see what they have done
[03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:53.400]  there was an outstanding documentary called state of mind and alex you'll have
[03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:57.160]  to give them the more information so the listeners know where to go search for
[03:18:57.160 --> 03:19:02.120]  this but the second that you can identify their scheme
[03:19:02.120 --> 03:19:06.600]  and their procedure in making us believe and buy into their plan
[03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:11.640]  that instant you are free from that and we need to spread that across the entire
[03:19:11.640 --> 03:19:15.080]  world this is not a texas thing a north carolina thing a new york
[03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:21.880]  thing a california thing a us thing this is worldwide worldwide we cannot

[03:19:40.600 --> 03:19:43.880]  guys all the time who i don't know on the street or a restaurant where we're just
[03:19:43.880 --> 03:19:47.640]  blabbering trying to show off to each other about sports and statistics
[03:19:47.640 --> 03:19:51.160]  they're supposed to be showing off about the economy and the world and how they
[03:19:51.160 --> 03:19:55.000]  know fact toys they've replaced it all with mindless information that's one
[03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.640]  reason people are so dumbed down thank you lance
[03:19:57.640 --> 03:20:01.800]  it's part of the gulag casino meets the smoking mirrors
[03:20:01.800 --> 03:20:06.520]  bread and circuses what the caller said which i keyed in on there was that it's
[03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:10.200]  a global problem and that if you can't find people in your local community to
[03:20:10.200 --> 03:20:13.880]  rally around these points seek people out in other countries and other
[03:20:13.880 --> 03:20:17.400]  communities you know during when when when greece and athens was collapsing i
[03:20:17.400 --> 03:20:20.040]  suggested that the occupy wall street movement
[03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:23.320]  should open up a branch in athens because they had
[03:20:23.320 --> 03:20:26.520]  common cause but nobody in occupy wall street
[03:20:26.520 --> 03:20:31.160]  did this and they argued to me that no no our our points are the most important
[03:20:31.160 --> 03:20:34.600]  points their points are not as important as our points so ego
[03:20:34.600 --> 03:20:37.640]  played a role classic little socialist committees
[03:20:37.640 --> 03:20:40.920]  shitting around like debating the finer points we saw it happen
[03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:44.200]  lennon's toenails saw it right there whereas as an economist i'm saying the
[03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:48.600]  economies of scale suggests that if all of these groups
[03:20:48.600 --> 03:20:52.360]  were to band together and use their combined global economic power
[03:20:52.360 --> 03:20:57.560]  they could overturn the power in in ways that they
[03:20:57.560 --> 03:21:01.160]  would would they they're talking about that they want to do but they just have
[03:21:01.160 --> 03:21:03.160]  to break out of their little silos their little
[03:21:03.160 --> 03:21:06.680]  egocentric groups as you're calling them and get into a global basis reach out
[03:21:06.680 --> 03:21:09.960]  to the global audience the global group out there well that's what info wars
[03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:13.480]  is about is just talking about historical facts
[03:21:13.480 --> 03:21:17.000]  and liberty versus tyranny getting rid of all the terms we use all the terms to
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:20.920]  communicate with new listeners but you're absolutely right max thank you
[03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:25.000]  so much caller chris in north carolina you're on the air go ahead
[03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:29.160]  hey guys um i just want to tell you about a tv show that came on i think it was
[03:21:29.160 --> 03:21:35.720]  wednesday night um tnt called legends it was the pilot episode and um
[03:21:35.720 --> 03:21:39.320]  they were looking for a guy called the founding father and they said he's the
[03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:42.280]  most dangerous domestic terrorist in the country
[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:46.120]  yeah every major cop show i've seen the terrorists are patriots
[03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:50.280]  and this is the total brainwashing this is what homeland security and the tanks
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:52.760]  are for and so they're smart where do we use the
[03:21:52.760 --> 03:21:57.000]  tanks first oh use them on black folks the bubbles will go for it
[03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:03.240]  and then uh the president gets set i agree i put the clip on my youtube channel
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:06.760]  i was going to say give up my yeah we'd like to see that maybe do a story about
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:09.800]  another example of demonizing the liberty movement
[03:22:09.800 --> 03:22:13.960]  it's uh c a in newsroom like a can of soup
[03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:18.920]  c a in newsroom and i just want to thank max for standing up to the
[03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:24.440]  scientist of bbc all right now let's expand on something here
[03:22:24.440 --> 03:22:28.040]  the best way to plug your youtube video is to give the name of it
[03:22:28.040 --> 03:22:32.920]  what is the name of the video no the video is legends tv series premiere
[03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:37.480]  dash domestic terrorism scripting all right yeah it's a new cd show i saw
[03:22:37.480 --> 03:22:40.840]  on billboard it's a new show so that i guess what the in the in the plot of
[03:22:40.840 --> 03:22:44.440]  the show they've identified the the bad guy as a patriot
[03:22:44.440 --> 03:22:47.800]  a founding father type so which is a part and parcel of what we know who the
[03:22:47.800 --> 03:22:51.720]  bad guys are george washington right so there's another example of that as well
[03:22:51.720 --> 03:22:55.480]  of what i'm well i think uh this is gonna backfire on them and get
[03:22:55.480 --> 03:22:59.000]  already is uh but remember that folks thank you
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.480]  christ let me jump in here for a second because this
[03:23:01.480 --> 03:23:04.920]  also puts a lie to this idea that hollywood is liberal
[03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:08.280]  that's false hollywood is not liberal hollywood is
[03:23:08.280 --> 03:23:12.040]  cranking out this stuff and it's right wing trash
[03:23:12.040 --> 03:23:15.800]  and then you're still you're just projecting them on the term right wing
[03:23:15.800 --> 03:23:19.480]  they aren't liberals is the issue they're authoritarians
[03:23:19.480 --> 03:23:23.160]  it has nothing to do with the term left or right they're not the build as the
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:26.280]  progressives that people think oh hollywood they're progressive they're
[03:23:26.280 --> 03:23:29.880]  into uh something they're not they're they're hardcore reactionaries
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:33.640]  in hollywood and they put out shows like legends and these other show the new
[03:23:33.640 --> 03:23:37.320]  video games you shoot tea partiers we just showed an article about that
[03:23:37.320 --> 03:23:40.920]  games con shoot races tea partiers in battlefield
[03:23:40.920 --> 03:23:45.080]  hardline i mean this is in every tv show and movie i see now
[03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:49.160]  that i like guns that's why i'm gonna murder everyone
[03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:53.080]  or i love the founding fathers that's why i'm gonna nerve gas new york you know
[03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:56.520]  it is just that they are getting ready to blow stuff
[03:23:56.520 --> 03:24:00.280]  up max and blame on the liberty movement that's their answer
[03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:05.400]  uh i agree i that's why there's an interesting dynamic at play here because
[03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:10.520]  there's very room left to to go for for sanction first for
[03:24:10.520 --> 03:24:13.160]  sanctuary i mean here you are in austin texas with this
[03:24:13.160 --> 03:24:16.040]  show and you are kind of like holding down the fort
[03:24:16.040 --> 03:24:19.320]  i mean where do you go from here there's very few places to go because more and
[03:24:19.320 --> 03:24:22.280]  more the population more and more the country is being converted to this
[03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:26.600]  extremism that's anti-freedom it's an anti-freedom extremism
[03:24:26.600 --> 03:24:29.640]  because this is what the government is saying we need to do to protect ourselves
[03:24:29.640 --> 03:24:33.000]  against the quote unquote terrorists and this is setting these people don't like
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:36.200]  the nsa spying on them wait i thought you weren't doing that
[03:24:36.200 --> 03:24:40.120]  these people want freedom they're terrorists they like the founders
[03:24:40.120 --> 03:24:43.720]  i mean they indict themselves with those bizarre statements
[03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:47.080]  but they can sense they own the media there's very little there's no debate
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:50.360]  no they just exactly they say two plus two equals five you repeat it off and
[03:24:50.360 --> 03:24:53.880]  off and off and off as the propagandists of the uh you know germany said in the
[03:24:53.880 --> 03:24:57.320]  1930s you repeat the lie often enough and people believe it that's joseph
[03:24:57.320 --> 03:25:00.280]  gerbils yep uh steve in isle while you're on the
[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:05.160]  air with max keiser hi alex um just want to thank you for
[03:25:05.160 --> 03:25:09.160]  waking me up um my topic is kind of off topic i
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:13.640]  guess um my son is going to school this fall
[03:25:13.640 --> 03:25:17.400]  and they're requiring a vaccine for him to go to school
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:20.600]  and it's all a lie there is no law there's a waiver they have to give you by
[03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:24.280]  law yeah and i found that waiver online so
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:29.640]  then i went to my family doctor and he's pro vaccine so i can't get
[03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:32.600]  him to sign it go to you just just search engine
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:36.280]  uh doctors that don't vaccinate or doctors that do
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:39.880]  vaccine exemptions and you'll you'll find a hundred of them in your area
[03:25:39.880 --> 03:25:44.040]  okay um then i got another topic here um about a year
[03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:49.080]  about a year ago um behind my house there's a bike trail that runs through
[03:25:49.080 --> 03:25:55.080]  um our city and i noticed there was a kind of i think he might have been the
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:58.840]  national guard guy but he was in full combat gear
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:01.960]  and he's walking down the you know the bike trail it looked like he was
[03:26:01.960 --> 03:26:05.800]  measuring something but i i just found it kind of strange you know
[03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:11.320]  here the guy was in full combat gear you know walking down the bike trail
[03:26:11.320 --> 03:26:15.800]  yeah they've got military conditioning the public for full occupation
[03:26:15.800 --> 03:26:19.160]  outdoing all sorts of regular government jobs now
[03:26:19.160 --> 03:26:23.400]  to acclimate them the police and the public for full occupation during
[03:26:23.400 --> 03:26:27.720]  the collapse and they'll say they're helping with the collapse and of course
[03:26:27.720 --> 03:26:31.320]  the military will be helping but no one will point out it was all engineered
[03:26:31.320 --> 03:26:34.440]  and staged well once again you're not supposed to have the military on domestic
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:37.560]  shores as part of the yeah yeah and i would warn people that was coming and
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:40.680]  they'd say no you're insane it doesn't exist you're a terrorist
[03:26:40.680 --> 03:26:46.040]  now it's yes we're using 1984 as a playbook and you're a terrorist if you
[03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:48.680]  don't accept it i want to get to a bitcoin question but
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:52.280]  tell folks about some of the new projects you're launching and some of the new
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:56.600]  websites max right so startjoin.com is a
[03:26:56.600 --> 03:27:00.520]  crowdfunding website i started in london and we also started our own
[03:27:00.520 --> 03:27:05.480]  cryptocurrency called startcoin which is similar to bitcoin except that
[03:27:05.480 --> 03:27:09.320]  we have it in house to give away so people who have a project like there's a
[03:27:09.320 --> 03:27:13.320]  project right now called uh sean hannity is an idiot billboards
[03:27:13.320 --> 03:27:17.720]  okay regardless of what you think of the project it is trending on the site
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:20.920]  and people are putting money into the site they need seven thousand dollars
[03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:24.040]  in total to start putting a billboards up in
[03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:26.680]  la in new york with sean hannity's face and says
[03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:30.680]  sean hannity is an idiot now because it's trending on the site
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:34.600]  just this past week we were able to get give it away 500 bucks
[03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:38.680]  to the project because we've got millions of start coin
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:42.520]  on our own balance sheet to give away to projects that people are
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:46.120]  people are voting that they like so not only are people crowdfunding by putting
[03:27:46.120 --> 03:27:49.880]  in a buck or five bucks we track which projects are being
[03:27:49.880 --> 03:27:54.200]  voted up and then we give more money from the coins that we ourselves have
[03:27:54.200 --> 03:27:58.760]  that we created called start coin and it marries this crowdfunding site
[03:27:58.760 --> 03:28:02.440]  called start join and it creates a new economic reality as you know going back
[03:28:02.440 --> 03:28:05.800]  15 years i've been involved in creating new technologies and new financial
[03:28:05.800 --> 03:28:10.040]  platforms for 15 years and this is my latest creation after my last
[03:28:10.040 --> 03:28:12.600]  uh company hollywood stock exchange got blown out
[03:28:12.600 --> 03:28:16.200]  blown away at 9 11 you know i haven't done a lot of work in this
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:20.440]  in this area for a while this is now my next big idea
[03:28:20.440 --> 03:28:24.520]  very exciting max keiser.com has links to all of it real fast
[03:28:24.520 --> 03:28:28.840]  curtain or only got a minute and a half left what is your bitcoin doubt and then
[03:28:28.840 --> 03:28:33.000]  max can comment on that thanks for your dialogue guys
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:38.040]  a couple years ago i read wikipedia all about bitcoin it took me all day i'm a
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:41.640]  computer guy but not a math guy and not an economist
[03:28:41.640 --> 03:28:46.040]  the founder who no longer works on it said this should never be used as a
[03:28:46.040 --> 03:28:49.320]  currency and it is open source but i'm wondering
[03:28:49.320 --> 03:28:53.560]  who audits the open source because we would want to know what the algorithm
[03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:57.720]  is and you need a very sophisticated uh mathematician honestly to
[03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:01.000]  to look into it also i'd like to know full disclosure
[03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:07.720]  from max on bitcoin well okay so on the first first question first so
[03:29:07.720 --> 03:29:11.720]  talking about bitcoin should it be used as a currency or should it not be used
[03:29:11.720 --> 03:29:15.720]  as a currency it's not designed as a currency it's designed as a
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:20.280]  way to have an open ledger open uh sourced uh
[03:29:20.280 --> 03:29:24.360]  way to transfer value from around the network with
[03:29:24.360 --> 03:29:28.200]  with uh charging any money and say what i'm gonna ask you
[03:29:28.200 --> 03:29:31.400]  sir you'll have to watch it be used at right time
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:35.080]  we have to in it now we have to go tonight that's it i take it over
[03:29:35.080 --> 03:29:38.600]  i got the guns we're not out of time sir tune in to keep going
[03:29:38.600 --> 03:29:42.120]  tune in tonight he'll answer the question on out he knows seven o'clock
[03:29:42.120 --> 03:29:45.240]  central we'll bring up the bitcoin question we'll repeat his question and
[03:29:45.240 --> 03:29:48.440]  we can re-erick sunday so the radio audience can hear at four to six p.m
[03:29:48.440 --> 03:30:16.520]  great job group
