[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  Yeah, what happens if they catch me burning this building down?
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  No problem.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  We've got Soros operatives ready to bail you out and set you free.
[02:27.000 --> 02:28.000]  All charges dropped.

[02:32.000 --> 02:33.000]  No worries?
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.000]  No consequences.

[03:57.000 --> 04:25.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[04:27.000 --> 04:37.000]  F*** your Jesus.
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  and more importantly what they're actually doing,
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  that was a test to see if they could work in concert
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  to totally suppress information.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  Because they've also been on record saying
[05:17.000 --> 05:19.000]  coming up on election day and thereafter,
[05:19.000 --> 05:22.000]  they're not going to let anyone but quote authoritative sources.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  That means CNN, New York Times, what a joke.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  They come out and say who the real winner is.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  That way they can contest the election even though Trump's
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots,
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession,
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  and have the UN come in and declare the election for Biden.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  And so when you see them in concert,
[05:44.000 --> 05:46.000]  censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready
[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  but also to condition the public that Big Tech works in unison
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.000]  to suppress speech and information.
[05:56.000 --> 05:59.000]  This is election meddling 101, this is illegal.
[06:02.000 --> 06:08.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:08.000 --> 06:10.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  Well, so does he.
[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:17.000 --> 06:23.000]  Music
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday,
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  October 15th, 2020 Transmission.
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  Well, I'm sure you've noticed that absolute tyranny is unfolding
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  not just here but around the world.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  The headline for the live transmission that you're watching right now
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  or listening to is breaking Big Tech censorship
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  of Biden bombshell test for total internet takeover,
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  November 3rd.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Now, we've actually seen Big Tech,
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  led by Facebook, Google, Apple and Twitter,
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  say that they're not going to allow disinformation
[07:08.000 --> 07:10.000]  if the president challenges the election
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  even though there's evidence that Democrats are going to challenge.
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  That's going to be taken as completely normal and good.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  They're going to try to hold it up for months
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  and then implement the 20th Amendment.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  So that information is absolutely critical to understand.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  And then as we approach, I've said this for the last two months,
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  the election that's now in 18 days, 97 to inauguration,
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  they will then accelerate the purging, the banning,
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  the blacklisting, the shadow banning of basically
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  100 plus million Americans because they said themselves
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  they would do that.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  So basically everyone I know who are even just mainline Republicans
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  or my son Rex Jones all are banned off Twitter now
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  just the last week.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  Because Congress has sat there and let Big Tech,
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  mainly owned by foreign countries and companies,
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  tell us what to do and engage in massive organized crime
[08:08.000 --> 08:10.000]  and massive censorship.
[08:10.000 --> 08:14.000]  So Congress is the equivalent of Native Americans
[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  when Cortez arrived who'd never seen sailing ships
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  or never seen muskets and never seen horses
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  and didn't even know how to respond to it.
[08:25.000 --> 08:31.000]  Or Midwestern Native Americans when the big iron horse
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  arrived on the railroad, they are just totally flummoxed by it
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  and don't know what to do and are following its every directive.
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  It's Big Tech that ordered all the stores closed
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  and ordered the courts closed and ordered everyone to lock down
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  and only communicate over the Internet.
[08:47.000 --> 08:53.000]  It's Big Tech that dictates what you can and what you can't say
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  about your view on the forced inoculations
[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  that are now being announced.
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  It's Big Tech that is announcing its own courts
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  and its own systems, its corporate global governance.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  And this is a massive evolutionary jump in their words,
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  the takeover of all of society as we know it.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  And I talk to people on the street that are wearing their mask
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  and I say, you know, they've announced that the mask
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  are going to be permanent.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Bill Gates says 10 years and they go,
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  I don't care, I like them now.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  You see, they're habituated and they're going to be habituated
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  to their smartphones and their travel apps
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  and all the inoculations they'll have to take
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  to have the travel app.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  And Gates is saying no matter how many vaccines you take,
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  you still won't be able to travel unless they say you can.
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.000]  This is permanent corporate technocracy martial law.
[09:47.000 --> 09:50.000]  And it's got the public turned against each other.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Let me read you some of these headlines.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  This is on infowars.com,
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  direct link to the Pentagon transcript.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  Senior U.S. Army official says there'll never be a return to normal post-COVID.
[10:00.000 --> 10:02.000]  You'll never be free again.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  That person needs to be fired.
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  Meanwhile, Senate Judiciary Committee to subpoena Jack Dorsey
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  after Twitter suspends Trump campaign,
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  House GOP accounts over Biden's handle.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  Why not?
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter,
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  all in a concerted effort yesterday
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.000]  blocked the barisma emails.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  It wasn't just the crack pipes or the hookers or the sex.
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  It was the emails that we have up on infowars.com.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  So you have to have a site to be able to have the information.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  It can't be shared over these platforms.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  Even Google is going into emails now.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  We've learned, if you have Gmail and blocking it,
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  the crack pipes and all of that is nothing.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  It's the emails from the head of barisma saying,
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  thank you for hooking your dad up with me.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  We'll get you the money now.
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Just like Biden says, hey,
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  they had a prosecutor investigating me and my son.
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  There was a billion dollars supposed to be paid that day.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  I said, you won't get that billion dollars if you don't fire that prosecutor
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  and son of a bitch, they fired the prosecutor.
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  So this just confirms all of that,
[11:05.000 --> 11:08.000]  that what they said Trump did, they themselves had done.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  It's always total inversion of reality.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  So this is the come to Jesus moment,
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  but is it too late for Congress?
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  Is it too late for the average, what, 79-year-old lawyer?
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  The average person in Congress is a 79-year-old lawyer
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  who doesn't even know how their phone works.
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  They'll always ask in hearings, is it true the phone can track my location?
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  And son of a bitch, I says, no, it doesn't.
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  Because technically it's not the phone, it's the GPS app.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  They all use legal ways to manipulate and lie.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  Oh, no, we've never worked with the communist Chinese on artificial intelligence.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  We've never helped spy on their citizens, even though they do publicly.
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  These are authoritarian elitists that don't believe in freedom,
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  that think you're a schmuck, that think you're stupid, that are allied with the authoritarian regimes,
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  making their move.
[12:01.000 --> 12:06.000]  And so now the House and Senate Judiciary Committees
[12:06.000 --> 12:11.000]  try to send letters out and publish that they're announcing hearings
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  and that they're going to subpoena Jack Dorsey,
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  and they're going to subpoena Zuckerberg over this,
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  and Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey say, you're not even allowed to say that on my platform.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  We are the government now.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  And the old lawyers sit there and piss down their legs, because it's what they do.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  They're the same ones that sold us out to communist China,
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  the same ones that let pedophiles operate inside our schools,
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  the same ones that are all a bunch of cowardly, old, stupid lawyers.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  And the chai comms and big tech muscled in and just pushed them aside.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  And they pushed the FBI side and all these people being enslaved by China,
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  enslaved by big tech, enslaved by the culture of Hollywood.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  Oh, but who's the FBI worried about?
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  Right wing Christians and white people.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  What a sick ideology.
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  What a sick group of people having their own future destroyed,
[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  but they don't care because they pretend they're part of this big, wonderful winning team.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  Look at these headlines.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  Twitter blocks linked to Republican Judiciary website
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  and another attempt to censor Biden's scandal.
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  And what's in the letter?
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  The fact that Biden's campaign is confirmed and the reason it's confirmed,
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  these are real emails, paper play, quid pro quo, absolutely illegal.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  And it continues.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  Senator Hawley and Cruz accused Twitter of election meddling over censorship of New York post-exposé,
[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  but still do nothing, just like Jordan will do nothing.
[13:40.000 --> 13:43.000]  We've got the letters, we've got the articles, we've got the emails you're not supposed to see.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  They're at infowars.com. Oh, but nobody needed infowars.com anymore.
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  Nobody needed Bandai video.
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  Oh, you've all got your Twitter.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  You've all got your YouTube.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  But you don't.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Because now hundreds of thousands of minders,
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  trained by the Southern private law center in the ADL,
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  are in control of their programming,
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  AI that goes through in live time,
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  even your private messages, and stops you.
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  And Congress doesn't see that as racketeering.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  Congress doesn't see that as organized crime.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  Congress doesn't see that as election meddling.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.000]  We just talk about Section 230 and do nothing,
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  because the Republicans have been bought and paid for as well.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  And so Big Tech doesn't respect him,
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  and is now usurping their legitimate power as our elected representatives.
[14:24.000 --> 14:37.000]  Congress is more and more becoming vestigial, ceremonial, archaic, a remnant, a ritual,
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  a skeleton of what it once was.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  That's why I told you two and a half years ago, we got banned everywhere.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  I said, we're building our own video site.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  We're beefing up the sites.
[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  We're doing our own system.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  We need money to build it now.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  Saddle it up links.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  We need to get on more terrestrial radio stations,
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  now more precious than ever.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Because the new dark age is here.
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  The electronic Berlin Wall is lowering down on us now.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  And I don't know if it's too late for Congress,
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  and too late for Trump, and too late for all these people that listen to folks like Brad Parscales,
[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  that told him their targeted ads got Trump elected,
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  not his grassroots, that was cut off starting with info wars.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  And now the president himself has his tweets blocked,
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  and has his YouTubes blocked, and is gamed and scammed,
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  because Big Tech works with authoritarians like China,
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  and thinks we're weak, and has never gotten in trouble for what they've done.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  And so now Big Tech works with Big Pharma and the UN
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  to keep a UN lockdown going, and the end of our economy,
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  and says the mask never come off.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  And if you criticize the forced imoculations, you'll be banned,
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  and your bank account will be taken,
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  and they're going to put dozens of them in you a year.
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  It was two, then five.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  Now Gates says dozens a year, in your body, controlling your DNA,
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.000]  raping you, controlling you, coming for you,
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.000]  because you rolled over.
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.000]  2020ElectionCenter.com. Just type it in one time, you've got to save right there in your browser,
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms,
[16:08.000 --> 16:13.000]  but most importantly via text message, email, or by word of mouth,
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  because they have banned the links to banned.video,
[16:17.000 --> 16:22.000]  but 2020ElectionCenter.com is a clone of the site of the exact same links,
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  the exact same videos where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[16:26.000 --> 16:32.000]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  Trump has finally figured this out,
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  and since he's going to take action once re-elected, he gets big tech.
[16:37.000 --> 16:39.000]  I mean, he's a modern situation.
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry,
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  because he has to take an action.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing.
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  and checking out the new redesigned infomores.com and sharing that with you.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[17:25.000 --> 17:30.000]  They're taking up with the media. This is a digital psychological dictatorship in their own words.
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  This is a planetary takeover.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  They're then going to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague threats.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.000]  That's so the wireless system can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot takeover.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  How did I know all this would happen?
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  Because they've been saying they're going to do it.
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  You see, it's not that I'm psychic.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  I know how to read what these monsters are saying.
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  You have to understand, as crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from me.
[17:55.000 --> 18:24.000]  It comes from them.
[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, ever faithful to my family, to God, and to you.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  And very, very honored to be here in this position.
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  I'm exhausted from the long fight, but I've got strength like never before,
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  because I know that we are headed towards the summit and the main battlefield, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  Let me boil this down very, very calmly here.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[18:51.000 --> 18:56.000]  There is a scientific breakaway civilization that has decided to give up its humanity and merge with machines.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  That is the AI religion that they follow.
[18:59.000 --> 19:01.000]  I told you this 26 years ago from their own writings.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  Elon Musk has gone public the last two years, Bill Joy, and others 20 years ago.
[19:07.000 --> 19:13.000]  And I've had overtures from these groups trying to get me to join them many times.
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  The head of the Kissinger Group in front of my producer tried to get me to join them as well.
[19:17.000 --> 19:21.000]  That was not in confidence, so I can tell that story. That's one of many times.
[19:21.000 --> 19:26.000]  I know the New World Order is real because I have their own documents, their own research,
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  and because I research what they're up to and because I understand their larger plan,
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  better than most of their top executives, they've tried to get me to join them.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  Just like they tried to get my father to join them.
[19:36.000 --> 19:42.000]  So when I sit here and I explain this to you, this is not a game. This is not a joke.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  These people are going to kill you and your family. Do you understand that?
[19:46.000 --> 19:53.000]  They're going to do it once your brain damaged and filled with cancer viruses
[19:53.000 --> 20:00.000]  and out of your mind in an electromagnetic soup so that you are debilitated to the point of you cannot resist.
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  Think about how a spider operates and you'll have the enemy.
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  Now, we're being caught in the web right now.
[20:08.000 --> 20:15.000]  They're moving on from the web point to spinning us into a more tightly controlled position,
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.000]  teaching us how to be locked down, teaching us how to be slaves.
[20:18.000 --> 20:24.000]  And then the next mode in the next year to three years will be fangs going in
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  and that's the force inoculation that you'll, quote, accept. You're really being coerced into it.
[20:29.000 --> 20:36.000]  And then once you've been given that soft kill, that spiritually, culturally, and genetically
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  will begin to liquefy your genetics and overtake your genetics literally with the mRNA vaccines
[20:42.000 --> 20:50.000]  and other things they're doing so that you spiritually and physically will fall to your knees in front of Satan.
[20:50.000 --> 20:58.000]  And then the spider, the last light of your soul leaves, will plunge its fangs in and have a blood meal,
[20:58.000 --> 21:03.000]  sucking every drop of a sanguation out of your husk.
[21:03.000 --> 21:08.000]  Now, that's who Bill Gates is, is a hungry baby spider of the mommy.
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.000]  And that's why he rubs his hands together like a rat and gets very excited and smiles when he talks about global collapse and death.
[21:14.000 --> 21:21.000]  Because metaphysically, he's hungry and wants to get the fangs in now for the main meal.
[21:21.000 --> 21:31.000]  Mommy is explaining to him that it's going to be a slow process, dissolving us, aging us, liquefying our soul,
[21:31.000 --> 21:38.000]  having our children turned over to them, sterilizing our young boys, poisoning ourselves, denouncing God
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  so that we get all the little free goodies given to us by Satan that aren't free.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  They're at the price of our soul.
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  So I just want everyone to know the beautiful continuum they have for you and your family planned.
[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  And this is what you face.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  This is what I face.
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  This is not speculation.
[21:59.000 --> 22:06.000]  I've just given you an allegory of the spider and its prey.
[22:06.000 --> 22:12.000]  Well, I am not the prey of the spider.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  All right, now let's get scientific and talk about what's currently happening.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  I told you eight months ago because they admitted this in all of their public documents.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  Would you like me to list them again?
[22:22.000 --> 22:23.000]  I know you all know what they are.
[22:23.000 --> 22:36.000]  Lockstep, Event 201, a bunch of UN drills, Pentagon report, 2010, the Ministry of Defense, 2007, flash mobs, microchips,
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.000]  and the coming collapse that will bring it up for the exact name of the Ministry of Defense report, 2007.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  I mean, you can already see it before they announced it.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  People saw those reports and they said, this is what Jones is saying.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  How the hell do you know this?
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  They had Boris Johnson at the UN saying, you will accept nanotech.
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  You will accept microchips injected into your body next year.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  And why was he saying that?
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  Because he's been told that's what's coming.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  And he was letting the system know, hey, I screwed people with Brexit.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  I'm really a globalist operative.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  I'm Darth Vader to Emperor Palpatine.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  I'd betray the people.
[23:09.000 --> 23:12.000]  That clip's coming up next segment as well.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  So I'm not trying to frighten you because I think you're cowards.
[23:16.000 --> 23:21.000]  I'm trying to get you concerned that there's no way out of this without fully breaking with the system.
[23:21.000 --> 23:26.000]  And when you've got a maskie around you that refuses to listen to the facts, disassociate yourself.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  Because they're going to disassociate from us and they're going to literally starve people to death
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  that don't take the inoculations and don't serve them and then don't follow their political will.
[23:35.000 --> 23:40.000]  Because it goes mask, contact tracing, apps on your phones, controlling where you can go, what you can do,
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.000]  always new rules, always new humps to jump through.
[23:43.000 --> 23:46.000]  Then when you take the vaccine, you'll be celebrated as a hero.
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  Then when you criticize people that are getting sick from it, that's going to be blocked by big tech.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  And that's all an exercise in covering up the killing they're involved in.
[23:53.000 --> 23:59.000]  And then the social credit score is brought in over those apps that did you take your child to a drag queen story time?
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  Did you let them sit on their lap?
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  Did you let them babysit your child?
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  Did you let them rape your child?
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  I mean, like letting your five-year-old get raped by a pedophile, you're talking major cred.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  It's going to be put in your system.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  And then, of course, finally sterilizing your child, massive.
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  You'll get five years living wage off that.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  Chop your own balls off, same thing.
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  Join Church of Satan, bigger bonuses.
[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  Hurt yourself, take lots of psychotropic, say that you're debilitated, say that you're depressed.
[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  Again, and then they tell you you're weakling and they tell you there's nobody there for you
[24:34.000 --> 24:37.000]  and they tell you you're so bad so you shove a gun in your mouth and kill yourself.
[24:37.000 --> 24:46.000]  They're all there praying on you to debilitate you, get control of you, make you depressed, cut you off from God, and then kill you.
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  Because, again, the decision has been made.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  There's too many people.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  People are too dumb.
[24:50.000 --> 24:51.000]  They're too lazy.
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  But they've made it that way with the system so that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy,
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  so that those of us that aren't like that will join the spider in killing our own people
[25:01.000 --> 25:08.000]  because then he can eat us last, that makes us defenseless when we turn on our own species with the spider.
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  So if you work with these entities and you do this to your own people, you'll be damned.
[25:14.000 --> 25:15.000]  What does that mean?
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.000]  You'll be cut off from the creator.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  You understand?
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  And all of this is accelerating.
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  And the big tech is the surveillance grid, the big tech is the control grid.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.000]  It's the thing to force you to do all this, and then those that you see like Governor Newsom and Hillary Clinton,
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  they're all wanting to be at the global government level.
[25:34.000 --> 25:40.000]  They're all wanting to show that they enthusiastically merge with this spirit and accept the destruction of humanity
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  and celebrate it, and they're all trying to become one with the Luciferian-Satanic spirit
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  so they can transcend the destruction of the planet.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  And they believe they're doing this beautiful thing and that out of this destruction comes the birth of this new entity.
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  That is the marriage of Satan and humanity.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  But in truth, humanity is being destroyed and giving up its humanity in that process.
[26:00.000 --> 26:09.000]  So when you see a Jack Dorsey or you see a Governor Newsom, these are absolute adepth Luciferian-Satanists
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  that their whole mission is destroying you and your family with a total commitment,
[26:14.000 --> 26:22.000]  total commitment to annihilating you forever and taking your soul with them into the darkest reaches of the universe.
[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  Now, this is the reality, and you're going to see it all unfold.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  Write this down. Record it. Remember it.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  There'll come a time when none of this is available online.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  There'll come a time when you're starving to death and the robots are coming to kill you.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  Just remember, God's real at that point.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  Call on Jesus' name. That way your soul doesn't get caught by the spider.
[26:41.000 --> 26:47.000]  Because it's the last moment it wants to trick you to beg to it and to say you renounced God so it won't eat you.
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.000]  And as soon as you do that, you're gone.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  All that matters is your soul now.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  There's only five days left in the Info Wars total blowout mega-sale.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  Five days left. I want to thank you all for your support.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  Because things are so unstable and so crazy and the supply chains are breaking down.
[27:09.000 --> 27:15.000]  I made the decision a month ago to sell out of our inventory and then to readjust and even see
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  if we're going to be able to continue on in the future with this model of funding or operations
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  by selling high-quality supplements for their products.
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  And thanks to your support, we've gotten in enough money to reorder most of the best sellers.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  We still have a lot of our best-selling items available, but they're selling out very, very quickly.
[27:33.000 --> 27:38.000]  We still have 30 to 60% off free shipping and the big thing, triple-patria points,
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  that's 15% off on your next order.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  If you sign up for auto-shipping, additional 10% off. So some of these deals are so good,
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  we lose money on the products, but regardless, it gets money into our coffers in the short term
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  to continue the fight. Things are so critical right now with the election.
[27:53.000 --> 28:22.000]  Be sure to visit the site m4store.com.
[28:23.000 --> 28:29.000]  No more pesky lawn order. When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.000]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts, election fraud,
[28:40.000 --> 28:56.000]  cancel culture, taxes and more taxes. Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[28:59.000 --> 29:06.000]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  is going to be your most valuable asset. In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung is COVID-19
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.000]  and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication
[29:23.000 --> 29:28.000]  into total and complete dehumanization.
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[29:35.000 --> 29:41.000]  This is their stated goal. I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you,
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.000]  but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  We turn this around. You must study their own writings, you must face the facts,
[29:52.000 --> 30:07.000]  and you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[30:07.000 --> 30:25.000]  Welcome back for an incredible time to be alive. I'm your host Alex Jones. Only 18 days left the election.
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  Of course, that's just the beginning of the globalist attempt to take over.
[30:31.000 --> 30:37.000]  The New World Order has been built one step at a time, and we're going to have to dismantle it one step at a time,
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.000]  but we have to first recognize what the enemy is, understand it, and then take action.
[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  Now, if you just tuned in, you may have missed some of what I broke down earlier,
[30:46.000 --> 30:52.000]  the metaphor of the spider and we being its prey, but that really is how this works.
[30:52.000 --> 30:57.000]  I'm not literally saying it's a spider, but when I talk about who the globalists are
[30:57.000 --> 31:02.000]  and the model they believe in and what they're establishing
[31:02.000 --> 31:10.000]  and how they believe communist China is an example of what they want to establish on a planetary scale,
[31:10.000 --> 31:18.000]  could a movie describe 115 million people killed by a communist regime like the communist Chinese admit they've done?
[31:18.000 --> 31:25.000]  Could a movie or the most horrible science fiction nightmare horror illustrate that?
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  The answer is no, it couldn't. These are individuals. These are hopes. These are dreams.
[31:29.000 --> 31:32.000]  These are souls. These are women. These are children.
[31:32.000 --> 31:41.000]  These are people harvested for their organs for the crime of loving God or believing in God that wasn't the communist party.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  And Tim Cook goes to communist China. You can pull up transcripts and see his speeches in Chinese.
[31:46.000 --> 31:51.000]  He can speak it fairly well where he says, I believe in censorship.
[31:51.000 --> 32:00.000]  I believe in the model of the elite. I believe in what you've done. I will stand with you for censorship here and in the rest of the world.
[32:00.000 --> 32:09.000]  Communist Chinese said three years ago, they said give us the code keys to all Apple devices, which they won't even give the FBI.
[32:09.000 --> 32:17.000]  They shouldn't. And they gave it to them and when the media Reuters an article about it, the communist Chinese were quoted saying,
[32:17.000 --> 32:24.000]  God, and so was Apple. When you move here and when you set your main base there, they're not based in Seattle now.
[32:24.000 --> 32:33.000]  They're not based in Silicon Valley now in California. They're not based in the West Coast. That's their old base.
[32:33.000 --> 32:44.000]  They said the communist Chinese officials say in the article, they said when you move here, you become part of us and you have to put our intelligence agencies in control.
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  Remember, even the head of Alibaba got in trouble because he wasn't giving him enough control and he was Chinese.
[32:50.000 --> 32:57.000]  And so I was in DC about a year after that happened and I've been making a big deal about it. There's the article right there with TV viewers.
[32:57.000 --> 33:04.000]  And I met with some advisors of the president and they said, Jones, this is blowing us away. We're going to get this to the president.
[33:04.000 --> 33:12.000]  So the next time I was there, a few months later, a Fox News host came and met with me and he said, wow, I didn't know it was this bad.
[33:12.000 --> 33:19.000]  Reuters reported on this. You talked about it. Nobody else did. I'll get it to the president. And it got to the president and he had a fit over it.
[33:19.000 --> 33:26.000]  And they said, well, don't worry about this, sir. Worry about Huawei. But what that shows you is it's not that I'm that important.
[33:26.000 --> 33:33.000]  This is how scary it is. It's that the lawyers that run Congress and the lawyers that run the White House have lived in America so long.
[33:33.000 --> 33:36.000]  They think it's all free and the checks and balances will all be there.
[33:36.000 --> 33:43.000]  Like somebody walking out over the edge of a cliff, like Wiley Coyote, who thinks there's cliff under him, and then finally figures it out and drops.
[33:43.000 --> 33:51.000]  But the real world, you don't walk out over a cliff and then realize it and then suddenly drop. When you realize it, you fall off the minute you stumble over the edge.
[33:51.000 --> 34:01.000]  And we have stumbled over the edge of a cliff. We're in free fall towards the bottom and we have a parachute, which is realization and our connection to God.
[34:01.000 --> 34:09.000]  We can rise like the phoenix. We can claw back what's been stolen from us. We can turn the clock back. We cannot go headlong into this horrible tyranny.
[34:09.000 --> 34:18.000]  The worst the world's ever seen. Communist China and the UN running it through big tech. But it's going to take Congress realizing they got scammed.
[34:18.000 --> 34:26.000]  You know, whenever I get scammed or screwed over, I learn from it. I admit it. I want to get better. But I've learned that's one of my best attributes.
[34:26.000 --> 34:37.000]  It's one of the best attributes you can have. Is that a lot of people I know that when they get screwed or conned or cheated, they don't want to admit it.
[34:37.000 --> 34:49.000]  They get mad at you. And I've used this example many times. This is a true story. I know a talk show host and I have a distant cousin and I also have a friend who would never speak to me again.
[34:49.000 --> 34:58.000]  Because they got email scams, Nigerian scams. Back when those were huge 20 years ago and then 15 years ago when these cases happened.
[34:58.000 --> 35:06.000]  And they give them that first thousand dollars. You get the email. Have you just sent us a thousand dollars? The Prince Boo Boo or Haboo Boo will send you 15,000.
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  And once you've done that scam, you don't want to admit you got scammed.
[35:10.000 --> 35:20.000]  So in a couple of cases, I caught the friends when they were at like $10,000. The second round. Oh, the Prince wants to send you a million now. We're going to send a representative to meet with you as well.
[35:20.000 --> 35:31.000]  And sometimes they'll even send a car with guys in the Royal African robes because they got networks everywhere. And then sometimes they'll get 100,000 on the third round.
[35:31.000 --> 35:40.000]  Because people have already given them this money and they want to believe they're going to get this huge investment because Prince of Boo Boo's got the money in this bank. He's got 15 million dollars.
[35:40.000 --> 35:49.000]  And if you give him 100,000, he'll give you the 15 million. And once they do it, they don't want to know they got conned.
[35:49.000 --> 36:06.000]  And then in one case with the talk show host, he worked for GCN, he flipped out, went crazy and said, Jones messed up my deal when I was on air, not even saying his name, saying, I know this guy on the network being scammed by Nigerians.
[36:06.000 --> 36:16.000]  He was on air believing it was real. Or maybe he was working with him. I'm not sure. But, but, but, but Ted Anderson can tell you the story.
[36:16.000 --> 36:26.000]  He was involved trying to get the guy to stop it. I mean, folks, this is what's incredible. Once they screw somebody, once they get you to wear a mask, cozy 15 days, now it's eight months.
[36:26.000 --> 36:34.000]  Once you accept the total fear, once you accept you're a hero because you do it, well, now you're going to accept you're a hero because you have contact tracing and fill out a form to go to the park.
[36:34.000 --> 36:44.000]  Imagine you show up in a big park and sit in the middle of the field is a green stand with plexiglass and you walk over and say, hi, I'm Alex Jones.
[36:44.000 --> 36:53.000]  I want to go to the park. Sorry, it's full. You're like, there's barely anybody in the park. Giant, huge, you know, park. Sorry, you can't, and then you leave and they let somebody else in.
[36:53.000 --> 37:04.000]  It's all arbitrary. It's all evil. It's all mindless. Just to see if you'll put up with this and see folks, that's all this is.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  So everyone's freaking out now. Wow. Do you see Twitter and Facebook and all of them?
[37:09.000 --> 37:25.000]  In a concerted effort, they blocked not only these real emails that are confirmed to be real in these photos and the eyewitness and all this in a major news organization, but now they're blocking the House and Senate committees.
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  Because it's an exercise of raw power because Congress won't act.
[37:30.000 --> 37:39.000]  We already have a government. It's called big tech. It's called the Communist Chinese. It's called Hollywood. It's called the blue cities and blue states that already got bought out by them.
[37:39.000 --> 37:50.000]  They're already running the operation to collapse the United States and saying no borders, no wall, no USA at all. We have been completely turned over to our enemies already.
[37:50.000 --> 38:01.000]  And Trump's starting to figure it out and saying arrest the heads of the deep state and, hey, we're at war with China, but the public doesn't get it and thinks, oh, this guy's just fear mongering because of an election.
[38:01.000 --> 38:12.000]  And the mainstream media is pushing for the destruction of the economy and the destruction of the dollar, thinking you're so stupid when they do it, they're going to blame it on Trump.
[38:12.000 --> 38:19.000]  So they're going to make their move in 18 days. They're going to hold up the election. They're going to try to kill the dollar.
[38:19.000 --> 38:29.000]  And it's up to us to get the word out that they're trying to do this so we can stop them. But even more importantly, in case they succeed, everybody's got to know who did this.
[38:29.000 --> 38:37.000]  Because notice they blame Trump for the coronavirus. They blame him for the economy problems. They blame you. They blame Christians. They blame white people.
[38:37.000 --> 38:45.000]  This is the New World Order strategy. And so I'm here to tell you, we're in the fight of our lives.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.000]  And once things get really bad, if we fail at this juncture, oh, we're going to have a lot of folks awake.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  But by then everything will be shut down. And I'll talk about that when we come back. I'll get very technical next.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  I said I would. I have it because I'm very emotional right now. But I've already foreseen all of this, and they're now doing it.
[39:00.000 --> 39:08.000]  And I have their battle plans as well. But my foresight is even better than my analysis. But it's just always, you can see it too.
[39:08.000 --> 39:14.000]  It's all very clear now. Let's go out to break with the president, though, calling it like it is, saying China will run America.
[39:14.000 --> 39:23.000]  This isn't rhetoric. If Biden wins, America's fighting for its damn life against enemies and traders. Here's the president.
[39:23.000 --> 39:30.000]  If Biden wins, China will own the United States. And I turned it all around. And you know that better than anybody.
[39:30.000 --> 39:38.000]  In 2019, if you go back 10 years, everybody projected 2019, the economy of China was going to be bigger than the U.S.
[39:38.000 --> 39:45.000]  Except it didn't happen because I got elected and I turned it the opposite way. We were picking up much more than them.
[39:45.000 --> 39:52.000]  And then I did the no dumping steel and I did tariffs and I did everything on them. No, no, they want Sleepy Joe to win.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  And if he does, if Sleepy Joe wins...
[39:55.000 --> 40:03.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[40:03.000 --> 40:12.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfowarsStore.com.
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[40:20.000 --> 40:28.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[40:28.000 --> 40:39.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[40:39.000 --> 40:48.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[40:48.000 --> 40:55.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  For more than 100 years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states,
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.000]  dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[41:09.000 --> 41:20.000]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s. They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[41:20.000 --> 41:30.000]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being at a Planned Parenthood.
[41:30.000 --> 41:38.000]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[41:38.000 --> 41:48.000]  Bill Gates is in control. They have spent 100 plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[41:48.000 --> 41:56.000]  This is the holy grail of their operations, and now they're normalizing, putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[41:56.000 --> 42:06.000]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what Infowars understands, what our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[42:06.000 --> 42:19.000]  We're in a digital civil war. There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on on every major tech platform, and now they're doing it to the private apps.
[42:19.000 --> 42:26.000]  They're doing it to text messages. They're doing it to email. This is mafia-organized crime election meddling.
[42:26.000 --> 42:36.000]  Finally, when they blocked the Hunter Biden and the Burisma information and the Chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest of it, it's been confirmed to be real.
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.000]  Biden hasn't denied it. Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control. You've got to stop it now. We're taking action.
[42:43.000 --> 42:47.000]  Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, oh, it's a mistake. It's an accident. It's an accident.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff. Well, Infowars is calling their bluff.
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.000]  Thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[43:24.000 --> 43:31.000]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.000]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech, I mean, he's modern in the situation.
[43:37.000 --> 43:42.000]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.000]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.000]  and check out the new redesigned Infowars.com and share it that way. Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[44:18.000 --> 44:37.000]  Well, there's no doubt that Infowars was meant to be here, that you're meant to be here. This great crew was meant to be here for this time.
[44:37.000 --> 44:47.000]  And again, I'm your host, Alex Jones. I hate to get up here and say these horrible things, and just to say these disgusting things.
[44:47.000 --> 44:58.000]  But you know what? I hate more is lying to you. And when I say these things, I sit back and go, my God, you're saying this because it's the truth.
[44:58.000 --> 45:06.000]  Bill Gates is obsessed with killing children and old people. He says it all the time. We have the clips. His father ran Planned Parenthood.
[45:06.000 --> 45:19.000]  His mother was a famous eugenicist that ran IBM. I mean, this is the front man of the enemy. May he burn in hell.
[45:19.000 --> 45:26.000]  But let me just do it this way. Let me just talk to you like I'm giving a report to the president.
[45:26.000 --> 45:37.000]  A lot of this information doesn't give the president get to others. The blind spot good people have is that you're not like Bill Gates. You're not like Ted Turner.
[45:37.000 --> 45:51.000]  You're not like George Soros or David Rockefeller. You're not like Prince Charles. All of these men have said they want to kill 90% of the world's population.
[45:51.000 --> 46:01.000]  That's the number they settle in on. And that's their religion. And so I made all these films telling you global governments coming, forced inoculations,
[46:01.000 --> 46:08.000]  lockdowns, checkpoints, tracker passes on your phones. Then people go watch Endgame, which they took off Amazon, you notice.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  It was going to number one. You know, I made it 13 years ago because people watch it and they go, how the hell did he know this?
[46:14.000 --> 46:22.000]  I didn't know it. It was admitted. God Almighty. Yeah, there's Ted Turner put that up outside Atlanta.
[46:22.000 --> 46:29.000]  The Georgia Guidestones say they're going to keep the public at 500 million. That's even more than 90% reduction.
[46:29.000 --> 46:38.000]  So let's just get into it. We just had a bear trap to catch our leg.
[46:38.000 --> 46:46.000]  Communist China, the big health departments of the planet owned by these big corporations are involved in a power grab.
[46:46.000 --> 46:54.000]  Big tech is exercising censorship control right now. And they began to say in their own corporate admissions,
[46:54.000 --> 47:01.000]  affecting the battle space in the last three months that, oh, on Election Day, we're not going to let any Republicans say Trump won,
[47:01.000 --> 47:07.000]  including the president, and we're not going to let elected leaders say it either. We'll decide from authoritative sources.
[47:07.000 --> 47:13.000]  They listed those as singing in in the New York Times to watch some posts.
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.000]  And so then we began to see the acceleration of everybody being banned or shadow banned or blocked.
[47:20.000 --> 47:25.000]  Well, it's clear. You don't just flip everybody off and take them off in one day. There'd be a revolt.
[47:25.000 --> 47:32.000]  So you just start incrementally banning people starting with Alex Jones. But as you get closer to the election,
[47:32.000 --> 47:39.000]  you're banning more in a day than you used to ban in a month. And they say on Election Day, everyone will be filtered.
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  Everyone will be blocked with keywords. And you cannot say that you thought Trump won.
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.000]  The Democrats are going to say that Biden won. They're going to contest. They're going to say count the ballots.
[47:49.000 --> 47:55.000]  You simply counter them or show a Project Veritas video or show local news showing election fraud.
[47:55.000 --> 48:00.000]  That won't be allowed because that is not authoritative.
[48:00.000 --> 48:05.000]  So I warned Congress and I got messages of the president and I know you did as well.
[48:05.000 --> 48:14.000]  And I just said they're going to put the Internet kill switch in the selective kill switch with the AI control a few days before November 3.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  It will be fully in place within 15 days.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  And then I was over at a big podcasting studio they've built here in Austin, not Joe Rogan's, but another one.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  And they were showing me the emails before we went on air.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  Hell, they even did it on air. It was the Drinking Bros podcast. We should get them in the studio the next few days.
[48:35.000 --> 48:43.000]  And there was the emails from Facebook telling them, we'll pay you to not post and not say anything on Election Day.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  How much money do you want?
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  And they were doing this to anybody that was prominent.
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  See, they're not even hiding it, folks.
[48:55.000 --> 49:03.000]  They're reaching out to the conservatives and saying, hey, sit it out and we won't ban you and we'll give you some money.
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  How much money will you lose, do you think?
[49:05.000 --> 49:08.000]  Tell us how much money you want. These are the emails.
[49:08.000 --> 49:13.000]  How much money do you want?
[49:13.000 --> 49:17.000]  And when they didn't respond, and I even pulled up articles admitting, this is not even hidden.
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  This is going on. I didn't even know about it.
[49:19.000 --> 49:26.000]  When they send you a number and you don't respond, they go, well, tell me how much, how much do you want?
[49:26.000 --> 49:32.000]  Because see, they're just trying to find out your price, you see.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  But when you take that money, you don't just lose your soul, folks, which they didn't take the money.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  You're now under their control and they're gaming everything.
[49:40.000 --> 49:41.000]  So they're so worried.
[49:41.000 --> 49:48.000]  They know Biden's losing so bad, they're trying to pay prominent Facebook users money to just don't post
[49:48.000 --> 49:54.000]  because the AI and the sensors aren't strong enough to control it all.
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  I was in their studios a week ago.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  My interview with them just there the other day, it's good.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  Two hours long.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  That's some fun.
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  You got to see what happened to the villain from Halloween.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  But that's where we are.
[50:07.000 --> 50:15.000]  So we should be having a larger discussion about Congress and what is Congress going to do?
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.000]  I'm not in love with these old men and I'm not in love with these lawyers.
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  I'm just saying, you jackasses are into your power, right?
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  You're into how your gravitas and all your courtliness, you're idiots.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  You've had chai comms and big tech run circles around you and take all the power away.
[50:32.000 --> 50:37.000]  So now they're my unelected government over me with banks shutting down our bank accounts,
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  shutting down the NRA's bank accounts.
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.000]  We're all going into slavery and you old dumb lawyers won't even organize your legitimate power
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  which would make you heroes, save your grandchildren and make you more money.
[50:50.000 --> 50:59.000]  But instead you want to be China's bitch because you're scared of the media when it's a paper tiger.
[50:59.000 --> 51:02.000]  I mean, is Josh Howley okay? Yeah, I guess he talks a good game.
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  Is Jordan okay? Yeah, I guess.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  Where's the action, man?
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  Little less talk, little more action.
[51:07.000 --> 51:15.000]  That's what gives me satisfaction.
[51:15.000 --> 51:19.000]  Everyone's having circles run around them because we have a normalcy bias that we're the USA
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.000]  and will always be free, damn it, but we're not.
[51:23.000 --> 51:27.000]  So the Internet kill switch, I've looked at the numbers, okay?
[51:27.000 --> 51:34.000]  They hit us with a 96% ban on all the platforms the day after Hillary lost four years ago.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  Then when they totally banned us, it was complete.
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  We have all the metrics, the numbers.
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.000]  And I started looking at other people's numbers in the last year, they all, they have an algorithm.
[51:43.000 --> 51:44.000]  It's like 96%.
[51:44.000 --> 51:49.000]  Now they're even getting rid of that 4%.
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  And then I watched Congress like, is it censorship?
[51:52.000 --> 51:53.000]  It's not censorship.
[51:53.000 --> 52:00.000]  It's racketeering total takeover where Joe Biden gets caught in an FBI coverup.
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  His son gets caught in it.
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.000]  With the emails from the ministers, we're going to give you money for the bereavement deal,
[52:09.000 --> 52:18.000]  smoking gun, and it's so dangerous, they all work in concert to shut it down.
[52:18.000 --> 52:22.000]  But again, that's because the people put up with it.
[52:22.000 --> 52:26.000]  They don't respect the FBI.
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  They don't respect the Congress.
[52:28.000 --> 52:31.000]  They see you as little bitches.
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  I wish you'd man up.
[52:33.000 --> 52:38.000]  Because in your own stupid self-interest, you're going to be annihilated by this corporate takeover,
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  but you're, oh, you live off the idea of America and great men before you.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  So you still think you have all this power when you don't because you gave it up.
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  You advocated your responsibility.
[52:48.000 --> 52:49.000]  You pissed it away.
[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  You stood down, you little men, you little lawyers with people pulling your chairs out
[52:55.000 --> 53:01.000]  and kissing your ass and your chauffeurs and all of it and big techs laughing at you,
[53:01.000 --> 53:09.000]  telling you, oh, your Excellency, oh, Senator, oh, Congressman, oh, Mr. President, I don't do that.
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.000]  I've told Trump I don't need you to tell me how great I am and pat me on the head.
[53:14.000 --> 53:15.000]  I'm not a dog.
[53:15.000 --> 53:20.000]  I don't want to be a slave of these people and I want you to defeat Communist China and the Pedophile Rings
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  and the New World Order and take control of this and build a pro-human future.
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.000]  That's what I want.
[53:25.000 --> 53:31.000]  So don't call me back till you do it.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  That's where we need to be.
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  But these candy asses still want to play the game.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  This is a takeover.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  It's over.
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  You're not playing two sides anymore.
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  And Trump, God bless him, gets it and says, we're at war.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  Communist China is conquering the U.S.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  We have enemies that want to destroy your future.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  Emergency mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday.
[53:57.000 --> 53:58.000]  Choose America.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  Choose your own common sense.
[54:00.000 --> 54:01.000]  Choose reality.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.000]  Say no to this.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  And there's a good chance with election fraud he's going to lose in 18 days.
[54:06.000 --> 54:11.000]  And even if he wins, despite the fraud, they're going to say he didn't win and all hell's going to break loose.
[54:11.000 --> 54:18.000]  And the average man cares about complying to the media and the government and his wife and everything else.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  And so the women are all desperate and freaked out.
[54:20.000 --> 54:26.000]  And the children are alone and evil's taking us over because men are a bunch of damn cowards today.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  And they suck their thumbs and they put them up in the wind to see which way it's blowing.
[54:32.000 --> 54:33.000]  I'm not doing that.
[54:33.000 --> 54:34.000]  And that's what we built Bandai Video.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  What we built in FullWords.com.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  It's why we're here.
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  We are on the air fighting with our great affiliates.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  So spread the word now, you Paul Revere's.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  Now if you've got any common sense.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[54:49.000 --> 54:55.000]  We've confirmed from high level sources our own research that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  They're that crazy.
[54:56.000 --> 55:01.000]  They intend to not just shut down in FullWords but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[55:01.000 --> 55:02.000]  And here's the really bad news.
[55:02.000 --> 55:05.000]  They're coming after everybody and they're coming after the economy.
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.000]  And they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  But here's the really good news.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  The really good news.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  Humanity is awakening to this threat.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  We're no longer asleep.
[55:19.000 --> 55:22.000]  And we understand that the globalists are our mortal enemies.
[55:22.000 --> 55:29.000]  And we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[55:29.000 --> 55:38.000]  That's why we must come together now as Americans of a race, color and creed and repudiate the New World Order and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  But also the information war support independent media that tells the truth like info wars dot com.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  Thank you.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  We've confirmed from high level sources our own research that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  They're that crazy.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  They intend to not just shut down info wars but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  And here's the really bad news.
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  They're coming after everybody and they're coming after the economy.
[56:06.000 --> 56:13.000]  And they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  But here's the really good news.
[56:15.000 --> 56:16.000]  The really good news.
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  Humanity is awakening to this threat.
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  We're no longer asleep.
[56:20.000 --> 56:30.000]  And we understand that the globalist are our mortal enemies and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and our Judeo Christian roots forever.
[56:30.000 --> 56:39.000]  That's why we must come together now as Americans of a race, color and creed and repudiate the New World Order and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump.
[56:39.000 --> 56:44.000]  But also the information war support independent media that tells the truth like info wars dot com.
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  Thank you.
[56:45.000 --> 56:52.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  Well, guys, I guess it finally happened.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  It's been a year and two months that I've been on Twitter.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  And as of yesterday, my account is permanently suspended.
[57:11.000 --> 57:15.000]  I've known this day was coming for a very long time.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  I've known it was coming.
[57:16.000 --> 57:17.000]  I've dreaded it.
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  I've expected it.
[57:18.000 --> 57:19.000]  It's just my lot in life.
[57:19.000 --> 57:25.000]  You know, it's the son of the forbidden ones, the son of the goblin, the son of Alex Jones, the son of gay frog man.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  I was going to get banned.
[57:27.000 --> 57:31.000]  And we can whine and moan and complain about that.
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  We can whine and moan about me getting banned.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  But it really is just par for the course at this point.
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.000]  We've given up and we've lost the fight when it comes to social media.
[57:40.000 --> 57:43.000]  We have lost our ability to fight against technocrats.
[57:43.000 --> 57:44.000]  The battle has been lost.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  The war has been lost because President Trump won't do anything about it.
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.000]  These massive media tech monopolies won't be shut down.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  They won't be broken up.
[57:51.000 --> 57:58.000]  They should keep getting stronger and stronger and stronger because as long as the president himself isn't banned, nothing will get done.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  And I had two strikes.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  First strike wasn't legitimate.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  It was them targeting me for something stupid.
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  They locked me out for an hour.
[58:06.000 --> 58:07.000]  Wasn't I mad about it?
[58:07.000 --> 58:08.000]  Fine.
[58:08.000 --> 58:09.000]  One strike.
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  There's this happened less than a month ago.
[58:12.000 --> 58:15.000]  Then I get my second strike.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  I'm locked out for a week.
[58:17.000 --> 58:20.000]  I'm locked out for an entire week.
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  Now, what I said wasn't a call to violence or called action.
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  It wasn't slander or defamation.
[58:26.000 --> 58:27.000]  It was under free speech.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  I could have said what I wanted to say.
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.000]  And under U.S. law, these companies are supposed to operate under the First Amendment, under free speech.
[58:33.000 --> 58:34.000]  They are free platforms.
[58:34.000 --> 58:36.000]  They are not publishers.
[58:36.000 --> 58:40.000]  But what I said was rude, so they cut me off for a week.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  I was mad about that, but I expected it.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  Now, I go to my computer.
[58:44.000 --> 58:47.000]  I think this is, yeah, I think this is Monday.
[58:47.000 --> 58:51.000]  I go to my computer and try to log on to Twitter.
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  Your account's been suspended.
[58:53.000 --> 58:54.000]  Okay, when do I get to log back in?
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  Oh, you don't get to log back in.
[58:56.000 --> 58:58.000]  You got zero followers and zero subscribers.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  Boy, you're gone.
[59:00.000 --> 59:01.000]  You're gone, son.
[59:01.000 --> 59:02.000]  You're out of here.
[59:02.000 --> 59:05.000]  You violated our community guidelines.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  That doesn't tell me anything.
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  Let me put it to you this way.
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.000]  You violated our community guidelines.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  My video wasn't hurting anyone.
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  I don't understand why you would censor me.
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.000]  Oh, right.
[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  It says here you violated our community guidelines.
[59:22.000 --> 59:27.000]  Now that I am banned on Twitter and I am a ghost with zero followers and zero subscribers,
[59:27.000 --> 59:34.000]  I must make the trek, the journey, the pilgrimage, the exodus, to gab and to parlor.
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  There are two places on the internet where I can exist anymore.
[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  I must go to Dlive and start a new show.
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  I must expand and innovate.
[59:43.000 --> 59:49.000]  I must escape the gravity well, the black hole that is mainstream media and mainstream big tech.
[59:49.000 --> 59:50.000]  I must escape Twitter.
[59:50.000 --> 59:51.000]  I must escape Google.
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  And how do you escape Twitter and Google?
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  You move somewhere else.
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  I'm Rex Jones and I'm moving to gab and parlor very soon and I'm moving to Dlive even sooner.
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  For more updates on my upcoming show and for more updates on my upcoming media platforms,
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  stay tuned to banned.video.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  I'll be coming out with a video tomorrow explaining in detail what exactly I'm going to be doing,
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  where you can find it, and more importantly, how we can all be a part of this fight together.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  These people want to take our free speech rights.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  They want to take our ability to talk.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  They want to take our ability to fight.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  If you cripple your enemy before you even fight, before even the battle, then how is he supposed to win?
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  How are you supposed to beat someone when you're in a wheelchair?
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  You can't.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  You die.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  You lose.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  And these people, they're so weak.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  They know that the only way they can beat you is to cripple you.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  And that's what they've done with literally every conservative and libertarian voice.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  Anyone right away, anyone right at Ben Shapiro gets banned because these people can't have an argument with those guys.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  They can't have an argument with Alex Jones.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  They can't do it because they'll lose.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  So what do you do when you can't beat your opponent?
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  You get rid of them.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  You ban them.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  You cripple them.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  You make sure that they can't fight back.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  That's what's been done to me.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  That's what's been done to hundreds of other people.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  All right.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  The full reports at banned.video.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  But that's why we have banned.video, which is banned on Twitter.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  You can share the link.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  It's 2020electioncenter.com.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  It's a clone of the site.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  The exact same videos, same view counts, same comments.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  It puts URLs over it.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  They banned that.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  We've got another URL.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  But that's what this is all about, folks.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And it's about total control.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  And then once you submit to them, there's always something else you've got to submit to.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  It's a global social credit score.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  It's an electronic straight jacket.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  It's turning you into a robot.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Say no to it.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  I'm going to come back.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Give the number out.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Take calls to the rest of the transmission.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  I am Alex Jones.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  This is your info war.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  You built this for the very time we're in.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Beyond Epic.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  I salute you.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  A major life lesson just took place last night.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  The top story in the country was that Hunter Biden's laptop information had come out.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Him with hookers and shooting porno movies and crack pipes.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  But the real news was how he had indeed been bought off by Barisma and had done so at the
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  best of his father, who was getting large parts of the money.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  But you see, Twitter and Facebook and others totally censored the info and even censored
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  major news publications and even censored the president.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  But when the president and Congress said they were going to take action, suddenly Jack
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  of Twitter said he didn't know what had happened and it was wrong.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  And that's the big life lesson here.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Standing up and saying no to organized crime, rapid caring, is the way to stop it.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Grobbling to it and letting Big Tech lie to us about it.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  Grobbling to it and letting Big Tech lie to us about it is the way to make these tyrants
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  continue to go absolutely crazy.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Remember, they support Communist China and its death camps.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  What will they do to us, will we now know?
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Saturday there was a big demonstration of a couple thousand people, the governor's mansion
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  in downtown Austin, Texas by the Capitol saying we want the lockdowns to end, we want the
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  face masks to end, we want all businesses to be essential.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  It's causing the third world to starve to death.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  The United Nations admits it's killing hundreds of times more what it's actually saving.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  The UN had just said that the night before.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  No one had covered it then.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  Of course, the president covered it Monday.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  It's now a big story.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  But we're there reporting this really important news, the governor, and they banned my son's
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Twitter.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  They said that violates community guidelines against dangerous COVID disinformation.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  I've got stacks of articles here where members of Congress have medical doctors in hearings
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  about if you have enough vitamin D and vitamin C in zinc, you cannot get any of these COVID
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  viruses because they can't replicate inside the cells.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  I mean, that's on the damn NIH website, but now Twitter, I've got a stack of articles
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  here is censoring CDC and NIH and national health service as well in the UK when that
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  stuff's published, including 10-year-old studies.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  So big tech is publicly wedded to big pharma.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  If you look at these big companies, they're all co-invested.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  And whereas you used to be able to have a consumer report site and comment about what happened
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  when you took a drug or took a vaccine, they're saying, no, no, no, you don't do that.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  And so my son, on Saturday, he said, I bet if I post this, it'll be my third strike because
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  you're criticizing the lockdown.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  And he said, I'm going to put it up anyways.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  And they banned it.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  But he made that step.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  That's good.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Because Congress is now seeing the House and Senate committees put out reports about, hey,
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  the media's wrong to be censoring these confirmed emails and photos and porn videos and, more
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  importantly, emails of Hunter Biden talking to the head of a risma about getting paid
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  off for his father.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  And they blocked the committees now, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  That's government.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  They're involved in something if the government came in live time through AI.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Imagine if the NSA was coming in at the National Post Office, which I've said should have its
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  own social media network.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  It's a counterbalance.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  It should have its own video network.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Taxpayers already pay for it.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  There's post offices communication.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  And then have the First Amendment over it.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  Everyone would use that post office system.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.000]  It would work as good as Twitter or Facebook.
[1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  And if it wasn't illegal, you couldn't do it.
[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:04.000]  You're like, well, Jones, you're a libertarian.
[1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  The corporations are bigger than government now.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:08.000]  They've got more power.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  And we see them as corporations that have had invincible rights when we have no rights.
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:18.000]  It was one thing for the Supreme Court ruling 200 years ago to say that corporations are
[1:06:18.000 --> 1:06:20.000]  individuals that have rights.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  That was dangerous enough.
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:26.000]  But now they have all these rights and we real people don't.
[1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  So this is a big wake up call.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  And Jack of Twitter, Jack Dorsey came out last night and said, oh, and a lawyer statement.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Oh, this is unacceptable.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  We shouldn't be taking this down when Congress finally said, that's racketeering.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  We're going to shut you down for censorship.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  He went, oh, we don't know what's happening.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  But now he's being subpoenaed for who made the orders, who did the what exactly?
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  Because they're acting as a government.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  They're acting as like a Soviet slash communist government.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  They're watching what we do.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  They're controlling what we say.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  And now they came out and said, I'm up to go.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  If lawmakers or anybody else says that Trump wins and an authoritative source has not said it, we will ban you.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  We will block or ban you.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  And again, they said, well, what's an authoritative source?
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  They said ADL.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  So they're probably law center, DNC, CNN, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, Associated Press, Reuters.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  So, oh, those are the authoritative sources.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  If Trump's got 97% of the ballots in and you count all the ballots that are out and say all those are for Biden, but still it means Trump's going to win.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  With the numbers, you say, OK, he's won.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  They say, no, we're going to hold it up until every ballot's counted.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  And that's their admitted strategy.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  John Podesta in a phone call with the New York Times, with a bunch of Democrats in the line during a war game admitted that's their strategy to never concede, hold it up, use the 20th Amendment to remove Trump.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  And so they're rolling this battle plan out.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  And they said a month ago, Big Tech said, anyone that doesn't go against, you know, anyone that says something other than what the establishment says, authoritative sources will be banned.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Will be banned.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  Will be banned.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  Will be banned.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  Will be banned.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Will be restricted.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Will be blocked.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  And I said, they're going to just start banning everybody up to the election.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  And then by the time we're there, a few days before everyone's accounts are going to be locked down.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  And finally, the day of they're going to lock the president's down once all of his support's been locked down, once all the Congress has been locked down.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  I said a month ago, you heard me.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  I said, they're going to start censoring committees.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  They're going to start censoring C-SPAN.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  They're going to start censoring TV feeds.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  They're going to censor the president when he gets up there at 2 a.m. on election night on November 4th and announces he's won.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  They're going to block that feed.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  And holy hell, they just said they're going to do that exactly because if they've got unlimited power and no one's going to stand up to them, it's easy to extrapolate and say, OK,
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  past behavior is the most indicative of future performance.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  What are they going to do?
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  Plus, they're telling us what they're going to do.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  And I sit there and watch Josh Hawley.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Well, gee, Jiminy Crickets.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  This is, we finally got you, smoking gun.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  And then Jim Jordan, I sent you a letter.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  Explain yourself.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  We might have to look at Section 230, Jiminy Crickets.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  Oh, Jeepers Creepers.
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  Oh, and Senator Cruz.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  This looks mighty bad.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  What you did, are you going to stop it?
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Because they're all scared.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  And they're doing nothing.
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  We're being sold out.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Communist China isn't conquering America.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  It just provided the financing.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  Big tech and the multinational corporations have, and they want to get rid of it, and they're pissed that Trump wants to make decisions.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  They don't care that Trump made them all this money.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  They don't care that they want to piss on America's grave.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  And they're mad that Trump makes decisions.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  They just want him out of the way because he makes decisions.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  That's why they hate him.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  And all these other guys just want to survive.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  They're just jockeying to get in a position to power down the road.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Because they know they're going to flip-flop power between Republicans and Democrats.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  And so they're not going to do too much.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  They're going to demand answers.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Answers.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  I walked up, hypothetically, I never do this.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  I like Senator Cruz.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And hit him in the head with a baseball bat.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  And his teeth are knocked down.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  He can barely talk.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  Blood's pouring.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  He goes, why'd you do that?
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  I want answers.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  And I'll be like, well, I'm trying to kill your ass.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  What do you mean you want answers?
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Here, I'll give you another answer.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  How about some break your ribs?
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Boom.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  Oh, how about your collar bone?
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  Ha.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  How about we'll just go ahead and knock your brains out?
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  Which I don't want that.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  It's hypothetical.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  And he's sitting there on the ground like, ribs broken, dying.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  I'm like, do you got any questions for me?
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Do you know what I'm doing?
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  It's like the Alamo.
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  You're being overrun by 5,000 troops bayoneting you.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  I mean, was Colonel Travis asking what Santa Ana's intent was?
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  I mean, you walk out in the parking lot.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  You got a case of beer in your hands.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Some dude pulls a gun out and says, give me your beer.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Give me your money.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  It's like asking him, what is your intent?
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  I'm like, here, take my beer.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  You're right.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  There's so these people going along with it.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  See, with his gun, takes the case of beer, hit him in the side.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  Get him with an elbow.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Get him down.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Break those ribs.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  Just racket.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Get my beer.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  Get my car.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  Roll out.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  Roll out.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  See, I don't need him to tell me his intentions.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  As soon as he pointed that gun at me, I just instinctively went here.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Have your beer.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000]  And when he took it, he was hurt real bad.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  That's a true story.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  I try to act tough.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  That's just how the real world works.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  But I guess I'm a throwback.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  I'm a caveman.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  I'm not one of these people that just rolls over and rolls over and rolls over and rolls
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  over.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And now we're going to find out that rolling over over and over again doesn't get us somewhere
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  good.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  It's just somewhere bad.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  In 18 days out, they plan on destroying this country during the contestant election
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  for civil war with massive big tech media ganged up on America doing this to us.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And the average person at the Pentagon, the average police chief is just going to wait
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  it out because they're winners.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  They're smart.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  They never commit to anything.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  They just sit back like little followers and wait to see who's going to win.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  We all lose under this dumbasses.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  Look right back.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Stay with us.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  infowars.com.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Look at the number.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I hope the phone's up straight.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  Stay with us.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  GPS location.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Now, the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids,
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying just like
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  systems to be saved forever.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  Your phone is spying on you, and companies are generating secret surveillance scores
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  based on information.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarsstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  hands.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  You know, there's some good news in all this, our affiliate relations director has been a producer and worked on this show, I don't know, 17 years, John.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  He said he's never been flooded by stations, wanting to pick up more of the show, wanting to help us, and realizing that all these things, Alex gets people awake, but he's a little crazy.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  He goes too far.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  Now, they turn on the news.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Pentagon says, horse inoculations coming.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  You'll never take your mask off.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  A local pedophile group to speak to your children about pedophilia, granted it is.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  I mean, it's just out in the open.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  Believe me, folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  I'm not happy about this.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  This is real.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  When I tell you these stories and I tell you these things, this is not made up.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  None of this is made up.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  Believe me, I wish it was every damn day.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  And it's not fun to stand up against these people.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  But I got to do it because it's going to be worse if we don't.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Let me give the number out and they start getting the clips. I've got like 30 something incredible clips and I want to take your calls.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  I had a bunch of big guests today that we're going to reschedule, but I wanted to just open the phones up and I'm pontificating here.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  But it's just such an epic time to be alive.
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  When the House and Senate committees are being banned on Twitter.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  We're in a lot of trouble.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  And that is election rigging.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  And again, we knew was coming.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  The logical extension of Congress doing nothing is this.
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  So again, I say the libertarians, I get your libertarian idea.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  I've been a libertarian when it comes to civil rights and our private lives.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  But when corporations become bigger than government and act like a cross between Hitler and Mao Zedong and we go, oh, well, the Heritage Foundation, it's free market.
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  No, it's not.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  They're tyrants.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  And our Republic is there to block the organization of such tyrannical operations against the people.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  And I don't ask, I demand President Trump and Congress take action.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  But then you look at Trump and he's on fire.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  Santa rest him.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  World government, the communist Chinese are running this vote for me or communist China.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  That's exactly what we said he should say because it's true.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  Does it sound crazy that we let ourselves get to this point?
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  But that's like CNN.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:54.000]  Oh, he's insane.
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  25th Amendment.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  He's saying China is backing Democrats.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  Pelosi said China wants Biden.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  China owns almost all Hollywood.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  They own almost all the debt.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  There's right to blow up our aircraft carriers for going through the South China Sea that's been open forever.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  It's never been under China's control.
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  China just runs along it.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  It's like saying Gulf of Mexico.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  Does that mean Mexico controls Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi and Florida?
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  It's called Gulf of Mexico.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  It doesn't mean that Mexico controls the whole Gulf.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  It's the same crap.
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  But it's much bigger than the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  You imagine the Mexicans had battleships going around threatening to blow stuff up if you enter the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  They would never even do that.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  It's insane.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  The Mexicans want your business.
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  But China wants control, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  It's like the English Channel.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  It's called the English Channel.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  Does England then say that the Netherlands and Germany and France and all those countries can't use it?
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  No.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  It's like you're going to Death Valley.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  They got Death Valley Pass because you're going to Death Valley.
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  It's the same thing.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  English Channel.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  You're in France.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  It's called the English Channel because on the other sides, England.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  Doesn't mean England owns the water.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  I'm going off on a jag.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  I see CNN and MSNBC like China owns the water from the north of Japan and Russia from the Arctic Ocean all the way down to the Philippines.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  No, you don't.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  You don't own 2,000 miles of water, you jackasses.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Let's see.
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  I'm informed.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  To me, it's not even smart.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  It's like cool to know this stuff.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  It's cool to study history.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  And then I know all this stuff and other people think I'm like making it up.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  I was with a medical doctor yesterday.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  Smart guy.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Nice guy.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  He was putting a post in for an implant because I clenched my teeth and finally, you know, lost few of these teeth.
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  Clenched it and he's like, yeah, no, I know.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  Most deaths for the nursing homes.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  Why do you think that is?
[1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  And I go, well, dockets because they're not getting any sunlight.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  Vitamin D3 and a lot of their food is debilitated and have a lot of leafy vegetables.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:08.000]  Vitamin C.
[1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:12.000]  Plus they have a lot of malabsorption in the lower and upper intestines.
[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  Once someone's above the age of 75, there has to be a higher level of supplementation to be able to offset the malabsorption issue with those type of disorders that we tend to see over and over again, unless a few disorders.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  That's just what they really need is a regiment like they did during the Spanish flu, about an hour of sunlight a week and boost a vitamin D and vitamin C and vitamin N.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  And the guy's mouth was hanging over.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  He's like, well, my professors didn't talk like that.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Well, I mean, well, why didn't they then dude?
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  I mean, it's not like I'm snap, dragging and pop here because I know all this.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  What happened to people?
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  The viruses cannot replicate after insertion of their RNA strain into the DNA in a high zinc vitamin D C environment.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Replication is impossible by reprogramming the mitochondria.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  That's simple viral reproduction information that you learn in seventh grade.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  But people don't know that they don't know seventh grade in formation.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  All right, I said I'd give the number up.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  Pull free number to join us eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine first time callers eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine.
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  If you're calling from outside the US sometimes one hundred numbers won't work.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  You can dial your country access code and five one two six four six 1776.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  I'm just so fired up with 18 days out.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  I mean, they're going to contest.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  They're going to try to break the country up.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  They've got riot teams.
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  They've got assassination teams.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  You heard caputo come out a month ago and got in trouble for it saying they got hit teams.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  That you know the cover for the hit teams is anti for their decoys.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  All this is real folks.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  And I'm not glad the fights here, but it is sick level.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  I am because people aren't going to sit on their hands while babies get aborted and devil worshipers run around with their tongues hanging out without now you paying something.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Everybody sitting on the fence that thought they could sell the fence.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  You got what do they call it skin in the game skin in the game.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  You got skin in the game now people are about to figure out that there is no spectators in this.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  There is no sitting on the bleachers that being in the middle of the roads the worst place to be.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  There's no sitting on the fence here.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  You're going to have your ass your black ass your pink ass your white ass your red ass your yellow ass.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  I guess one of these go in the dark, anti fill your green ass.
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  You're going to have your ass in the game.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  It's all the delusion all the fake crap.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  Everything's going away folks the next few years.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  You think stuff's bad now.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  You're going to look back on this time like it's good.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  Here's what's going to happen.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Trump is reelected.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  He's going to try to fix stuff.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  They're still going to implode things.
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  It'll be a lot better, but it's going to be bad.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Oh, but let me tell you they get rid of Trump.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  They're going to blame everything they do on him forever.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  And you just get ready for the left to bully the living snot out of you till you finally start standing up to their ass.
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  That's you.
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  I can be for Vendetta.
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  He says the inspector says, well, why didn't you do something before this?
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  He said, I was waiting for you, inspector.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  I was waiting for you.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  Why didn't I do something?
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  I tried to do something.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  I did you.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  I've come to you many times and asked for your support and you've always come through and info wars has come through.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  We've never sold out.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  We've never backed down.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  We've always told the truth.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  We've made mistakes, but 98% of the time or so, we're dead on and the enemy knows that info wars is a thought leader, not just here, but around the world.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  And that's why the chai comms, Hollywood, the globalist want us off the air because their global plan of total tyranny and a post human world will not succeed if we stay on air.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  If you don't support us, ladies and gentlemen, now they're going to shut info wars down and shut everybody else down as well.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  You already know that it's out the open.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Again, count the cost, focus and realize how critical you are with your word of mouth spreading the word that overrides the sensors, your financial support, getting the products at info wars store.com and your prayer.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  I'm praying for you.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  Please pray for us.
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Let's do this together.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  We're going to win.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  We are winning, but it's not going to be easy.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  The enemy is trying to take it all from us.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Let's not let them succeed.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  There's only five days left in the info wars total blowout mega sale.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Five days left.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  I want to thank you all for your support because things are so unstable and so crazy and the supply chains are breaking down.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  I made the decision a month ago to sell out of our inventory and then to readjust and even see what I'll be able to continue on in the future with this model of funding our operations by selling high quality supplements for their products.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  And thanks for your support.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  We've gotten in enough money to reorder most of the best sellers.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  We still have a lot of our best selling items available, but they're selling out very, very quickly.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  We still have 30 to 60% off free shipping and the big thing triple patriot points.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  That's 15% off on your next order.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And you sign up for auto shipping additional 10% off.
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  So some of these deals are so good.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  We lose money on the products.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  But regardless, it gets money into our coffers in the short term to continue the fight.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Things are so critical right now with the election.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Be sure and visit the site info wars store.com.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  History is now history is taking place in front of us.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  We are at the crossroads.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  We are now only two weeks out from the most historic and important election in world history.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  I've been saying that for over a year, but now people really understand I wasn't exaggerating.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  This is so critical.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  The new world order wants to repudiate the nation state that will repudiate the idea of America.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  They want to repudiate the idea of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and bring in their technocracy.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  So they are throwing everything they've got and not just the American people, but the people of the world.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  That's why your word of mouth is beyond king.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  It is paramount.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  When you spread the articles, when you spread the videos, when you shoot your own video or write your own article
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  or knock on your neighbor's door and talk to them or call your friends and family and tell them to vote for Trump.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  When you speak out against the system, when you do things that seem little, together it adds up into giant things.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  Many hands make life work.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  This brings happening now. Take action now while you still can. Please, for all of our futures.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  This is the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  This is their stated goal.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  You must serve us around. You must study their own writings. You must face the facts.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  And you must come to grips with it. You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  I was looking for you. Join the fight. I need you to win the fight. You're the key to winning the fight.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  It has, in fact, been contaminated.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Authorities are attempting to control its deadly spread.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  Set a wave of destruction throughout the underground.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Filled by the media, fear and panic spread quickly, fracturing and dividing the country until at last the true goal comes into view.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  Before the St Mary's crisis, no one would have predicted the results of the election that year, no one.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  And then not one after the election, low and behold, a miracle.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  Some believed it was the work of God Himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:29:02.000]  A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims.
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  But the end result of the true genius of the plan was the fear.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  The fear became the ultimate tool of this government and through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of high chancellor.
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:20.000]  The rest is they say in this history.
[1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  Can you prove any of this?
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  Why do you think I'm still alive?
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  All right. We'd like to take you into protective custody, Mr. Rockwood.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  Oh, I'm sure you were.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  But if you want that recording, you'll do what I tell you to do.
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  Put Creedy onto 24-hour surveillance.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  When I feel safe that he can't pick his nose without you knowing, I'll contact you again.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Until then, cheerio.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Rockwood, why didn't you come forward before?
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  What were you waiting for?
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Well, for you, inspector, I needed you.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  You have to quit waiting for somebody else to do it now.
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  During epic times like this, my blood gets up, I get really excited and I tend to not be intellectual and not get to the meat potatoes.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  I had an article here in my stack that I was going to leave the show with today that the man in Delaware that Biden was such a drug addict, he left it there.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.000]  He forfeited it, didn't pay for it.
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  So the guy's reformatting the hard drive.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  He pulls it up.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  It's Hunter Biden, Robert Biden's his real name, banging hookers, snorting cocaine, smoking coke.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  Talking about business deals and he got scared.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  He said, well, they later learned I've got this. They'll kill me. I got to give it to the FBI. That's what I would do.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  The guy talks about, he found child porn before he called the FBI. They did a good job.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  That was regular FBI agents, not the special politicals.
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  So the media focuses on the crack pipe and the hooker videos.
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  And we've got this stuff linked up on infowords.com.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  That's why we're here.
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.000]  So this stuff can get out. It's all on infowords.com. Go read it.
[1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  Your discretion, advice, the photos, videos, it's all up there.
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Well, Giuliani, because the FBI wouldn't do anything with this, got it.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  He's definitely got some wavos.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  And he said last night, they played it on the war room.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  In fact, guys seem to queue that up so you can find that.
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  Giuliani said, hey, a lot worse stuff's about to come out.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:40.000]  We're just basically waiting to see what Biden does.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  Well, you saw the massive censorship, the panicking.
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:46.000]  The Biden campaign said, well, the fact that it's censored shows it's fake.
[1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  Oh, wow. Even though they earlier admitted it was real.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  But now they've released new emails from Robert Biden, Hunter Biden in 2017.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  And it talks about payoffs and what you get for the payoffs.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  This is so, like the regular mafia would be smart enough not to spell stuff out when,
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  hey, you give me this, I give you that.
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  This is what they queued Trump with in Ukraine and quid pro quo.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  My understanding is that the original agreement, this is from Burisma,
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  with the director was for consulting fees based on introductions alone.
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  This is from Hunter Biden to them.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  My understanding is the original agreement with the director was for consulting fees
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  based on introductions alone, the rate of 10 million per year
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  for a three year guarantee of total of 30 million, 30 million dollars to introduce him to his daddy.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  Hunter Biden demanded 30 million from Burisma to be introduced to his father.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  There's your headline.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  But Jack Dorsey and Jeff Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook,
[1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:10.000]  Tim Cook that runs death camps, but it's okay, he's gay.
[1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  They literally are trying to block this information.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  You imagine what's going to come out next, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  Let's start over on the email.
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  My understanding is the original agreement with the director was for consulting fees
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  based on introductions alone, the rate of 10 million per year
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  for a three year guarantee total of 30 million.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  The chairman changed that deal after me in Miami,
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  we in Miami to a much more lasting and lucrative agreement, all caps by the way,
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  to create a holding company 50% owned by me in all caps, me and 50% owned by him.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  Consulting fees is one piece of our income stream,
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  the reason this proposal by the chairman was so much more interesting to me is that
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  my family is that we would also be partners in like a hotel,
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  the equity and profits of JV's investments.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  And he goes on to demand the money.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  Folks, this is the most open and shut smoking gun craziness with this crack head son
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  who got kicked out of the Navy for being a crack head.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  And what did Trump say two months ago?
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  He said, I found out China isn't the one ripping us off on the drugs,
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  they get about 20%, it's a fair deal.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  The middlemen are the ones that charge us three times what it's worth,
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  the highest in the world, I'm ending that, you're getting a good deal.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Trump didn't step in and go, I'm the new boss, I get the trillion dollars.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  He went, it's over.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And he said, they're going to come after me now, they may kill me.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  You remember he said, I may be gone.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  He said, that's okay, God put me where I am and he looked up.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  He said, this is Providence, I've got a mission.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  I mean, folks, the American people ought to be literally throwing rose petals at Trump.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Because I mean, he's literally like, how would you like your prescription drugs going down on average 70%?
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  And Trump's like, I can't believe it, these middlemen are making billions of peace
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  off getting between you and these drugs.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  He goes, I think I've got a better idea though.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  How about we make the drugs that are safe, if they are safe, here in America,
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  and then we hire the factory workers, pay them well, build an infrastructure and have a fair price.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  How about that?
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  Who bought them TV, bitch, tell me that?
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  To quote Ludacris, I mean, move, bitch, get out the way, move out the way, bitch, get out the way.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  I mean, you got this whole new world order, literally, that sold off America,
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  and that screws us at every level, and you've got these pieces of crap that run it and do it,
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  and they think it's funny and it never stops.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  Yeah, $3,000 plus for the first round of rendezvous here that Fauci and China invested in,
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  it doesn't even help you.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  God almighty.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  These people make me sick.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  To be like $50, they say.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  That still makes some money.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  I'm sorry, I'm going to go break them back with your calls.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I mean, that's just one of these stories, it's up on infowars.com.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  Zero had just got it to latest cash of email to tell us how Hunter Biden earned millions in China for introductions.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  I mean, that's quid pro quo, baby.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  It's obviously on there, and the same thing with Hillary and her deal.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  Should have just shared a subpoena Jack Dorsey at her Twitter suspense Trump campaign.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  House GOP of Councilor Biden's channel.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:01.000]  G.G. Ping tells elite troops prepare for war after U.S. destroyer sells through Taiwan Strait.
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  Screw you, you piece of commie crap, man.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  God, I just want to see the Chinese agents in this country.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  Let me tell you, I'm not a violent person.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  They've killed 100 million of their own people.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  But if the people are squeamish about this once they're found convicted of the new Nuremberg trials,
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  I will not wear a black hood.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  I will sit up there 12 hours a day.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  I'll put the hoods on their heads, I'll put a noose around their neck,
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  and I'll pull that switch all day long.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  You got my absolute commitment.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  I'll sit there and I'll take part in the eradication of this trash.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  I am so sick of these murdering filth of 3 million Muslims and death camps,
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  a million Christians and Buddhists and death camps.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  Burn it, hell, commies!
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Burn it, hell, sorrows!
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Burn it, hell, Biden!
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Burn it, hell, Bill Gates!
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Burn it, hell, media matters!
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Burn it, hell, murderers!
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Band Dot Video
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band Dot Video on your iPhone.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Simply go to Band Dot Video with your Safari browser.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  I suggest Band Dot Video.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  You will now have Band Dot Video app on your Home Screen,
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  The globalists think you're lazy,
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  but by taking a little bit of action,
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  you can override them, have the app,
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech,
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  and click the Share buttons below.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  On your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube,

[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  Infection Supervillains are known as Supervillains
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  because they have gigantic, huge, global plants
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  And I might have told you a year ago, back in October of 2019,
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  would roll out a global hysteria,
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  and a lot down the planet, start millions of people,
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  and would be pushing a forced inoculation
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  to even be able to leave your houses,
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  and that this same billionaire would say,
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  we're all going to work from home now,
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  and that this was good to lower the carbon footprint
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  and the human population.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  You tell me that's crazy. You tell me that's a dystopia.
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  But in reality, it really did happen.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  His name is Bill Gates,
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  the head of a major eugenics consortium
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  Until we start saying, no, we are Bill Gates's property,
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  it's time to expose Bill Gates.
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  If you pay close attention to what Big Tech is actually saying,
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  and more importantly what they're actually doing,
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  when they shut down the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  that was a test to see if they could work in concert
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  and totally suppress information,
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  because they've also been on record saying,
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  coming up on election day and thereafter,
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  they're not going to let anyone but, quote,
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  authoritative sources, that means CNN, New York Times,
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  what a joke, come out and say who the real winner is.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  That way they can contest the election,
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  even though Trump's declared winner,
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  hold everything up with the ballots,
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  then cause a constitutional crisis,
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  call for secession, and have the UN come in
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  and declare the election for Biden.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  And so when you see them in concert,
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  that is a drill, that is a test,
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  to get all their systems ready,
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  but also to condition the public
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  that Big Tech works in unison
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  to suppress speech and information.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  This is Election Meddling 101, this is illegal.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  The system is censoring
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  because of the power of the people
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  overrode them four years ago.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  Trump has finally figured this out,
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  and since he's going to take action,
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  once re-elected against Big Tech,
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  I mean, he's modern in this situation.
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now,
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  so we're going to sit here and cry,
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  because he has to take an action.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  We the people are taking action now,
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  and you can do it very, very easily by sharing,
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  by watching out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  and sharing that link.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  And the chauffeur drives your cars.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  You let everybody know.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  But don't play with me,
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  because you're playing with fire.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  The globalists know they're losing control
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  of the United States, so they're doubling down,
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  revealing themselves at such a dangerous time.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  But my spirit's on fire, I feel victory.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  We've said this a thousand times.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Trump needs to say it's a fight between America and China,
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  and a fight for our survival and America
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  will rally and understand the threat.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  And now, every speech he gives in the last three days,
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  he says this.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  In fact, he's speaking, giving a speech as we speak.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  We paused it a few minutes ago,
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  but here is the president talking about
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  who we're really fighting against. Here it is.
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  Steals were made at the same time
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  that Joe Biden was letting China steal your jobs
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  and take away your factories.
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  If Biden is elected, the United States will be owned by China.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  But we don't have to worry about it, because I can't believe.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  I can't believe it's going to happen.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  He's shot, just so we understand.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  We cannot have a leader that's just about half shot.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  Can we believe we're even fighting against this guy?
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  But you know what? They're a powerful party.
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  They're a very corrupt party.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  They're in bed with the media, the fake news, right back there.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  Good pause. This is so powerful.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  I just want to cry.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  We say this is truth. We don't talk to each other about this.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  It's what you see. How are we letting globalists do this?
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  Totally screw us. Sell our birthright out.
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  Why would any Democrats support this?
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  I mean, Trump literally does not do stuff for his own money entrance.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  He does it for what's better for everybody.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  I study each damn topic.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  I knew when he did the vaccine thing, he was taken away from Gates
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  so he could kill that whole thing.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  Now you see Gates is pissed.
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  Doesn't mean I agree with the Machiavellianist,
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  because I'm not as sophisticated as Trump.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  I just don't delve in those areas.
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  But Trump is mopping the floor.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  But you can see in his eyes, though, he's concerned.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  He's like, I can't believe we're even having to do this,
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  but God, he knows they're going to contest
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  and he's totally freaked out because he understands
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  this is the big epic contest.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  He's not worried about Donald Trump or his family.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  He is in a spiritual war now.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  As he said, he was always a Christian,
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  but it was never a big deal to him.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  He just knew God.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  Once he got into this, now he has energized
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  and can see this stuff.
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  And he just is absolutely on fire right now
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  because he is seeing the enemy.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  He has discernment.
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  It's through the fire, folks. It's like a video game.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  Your discernment goes up and up and up and up.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:12.000]  To a certain point, you're just like,
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  oh my God, why would anybody go with the devil?
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  This is ridiculous.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  But see, they don't have that sight above the mountains.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  They're down in the valley, man.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  They're down in the mine. They're down in the hole.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  They don't have the sight, Trump.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  They've not gone through the fire yet.
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:32.000]  That's why they try to keep you subordinate
[1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  and never informed and never engaging in a victim.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  Because if you fight, you get stronger.
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  You see, it's like muscles.
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  It's like breathing.
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  So, let's go back to president in your calls.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  But here he is.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  And totally protected by Big Tech.
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  If I said what he said,
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  they'd be calling from me out of there in 24 hours
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  what this guy has said.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  Two days ago, he said,
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  I'm running for the United States Senate.
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  That's the third time he said,
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  I'm running for the...
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  Look, that's not like a regular, like, mistake.
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  You can make a mistake.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  He said that, and he said other things,
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  but we won't even get into it.
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  This is crazy.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  This is the craziest race.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  You know what?
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  I'm running against the worst candidate
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  in the history of presidential politics.
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:24.000]  And if I lose, it puts more pressure.
[1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000]  I wish he was good.
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  I wish he was good. I'd have less pressure.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:30.000]  I mean, how do you lose to a guy like this?
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  How do you lose to a guy like this?
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  Aye-aye-aye.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:36.000]  And by the way, we're leading in North Carolina.
[1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  Paul just came out.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  I think we're leading everywhere
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  where people are intelligent, actually.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  And you actually, we just got to report
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  the lines are through the roof
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  on areas that would more typically vote for us.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  Trying to be diplomatically...
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  I said I go to the calls, but that's so powerful.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  We'll back that up three minutes, guys, we can.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  And we'll play it next hour.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  But I mean, there he is saying,
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.000]  I can't believe they're going with China.
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  I can't believe they're going against their own self-interest.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  It's all been a tilted playing field
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  to not even give the Chinese power.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  The globalists just use that as a place,
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  use their people as slaves.
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  It's like Trump said, it's the middleman.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:22.000]  That's what Trump told G.G.P.
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  He said, hey, we'll give your workers a 10% raise.
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  But the middlemen are cut out.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  And G.G.P. has got deals with them.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  He's like, no, we're not doing it.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  I said, we're going to war then, buddy boy.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  We're not going to send hundreds of billions
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  of dollars a month
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  to a bunch of jerks that sold out America.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  I don't care the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  the Clintons, who they are,
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  they're not getting that money.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  You know what they say about those Scots?
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  They can turn a piece of coal up their ass into a diamond.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  I mean, he's got that German genetics
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  with that Scott on top of it.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  What a mix, man, with Trump.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  I mean, he literally cannot stand us being screwed.
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  And with him, it's not even about us.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  I mean, it is, but it's about,
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  he just cannot stand bad business deals, one-sided deals.
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  I don't have people that know Trump well.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  I mean, he'll like give his employees huge bonuses
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  or be really nice to certain people
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  and like pay some black couples a mortgage
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  that fixes his black, you know, his attire or whatever.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  But when it comes to other billionaires,
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  Trump is obsessed with dominating them and defeating them.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  And thank God we've got Trump in there.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  All right.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  We got Jared Indiana says,
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Trump can stop big tech and China takeover.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  I want to hear what Jared has to say.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Jared, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  Yeah, Alex, I was just wanting to know if you think
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  there's any kind of laws that he could put in place
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  to stop after he's not president anymore,
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  to stop the censorship all over
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  because as you were talking about earlier.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  Yeah, it's not just section 230.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  It's racketeering, it's organized media,
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  blocking certain groups, it's total discrimination.
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  It's illegal on every front.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  Just the Justice Department is filled with a bunch of baby,
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  darling, leftist, brainwashed, club kids
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  that they put in there that literally hate America.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  The average Justice Department prosecutor,
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  not the FBI agents, is literally
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  a America-hating leftist libtard.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  So you understand their whole ethos is hating the country.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  Yeah, and like you were saying earlier about the discernment
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  as a Christian, I think that we fill it
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  in God's spirit stirring in the church
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  and in people who believe in God
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  that the evil is revealing itself now.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  It's coming out in the open.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  Yeah, and my discernment is God is like literally ordering me
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  to attack, just to take action, win,
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  and then all these ideas are pouring in.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Because I mean, I've always had a drive.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  It's 100 times whatever it was.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  It's just like, it's just overwhelming.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  It's like, you will stop this, boy.
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  Get your ass up.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  Are you not feeling that?
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  Oh, yeah, 100% agreed.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  And I try to tell everybody, you know,
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  tell them what the Bible says at the end,
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  what's going to happen in the revealing
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  and what the letters to the churches were saying
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  what it would be like.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  And you could see it.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  Maybe it's not fully blown yet,
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  but it is definitely, you could see
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  that it's going to be blown in.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  Well, let me explain space-time continuum.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  We are all psychic and we're all in God's will.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  So we're bouncing forward time,
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  and the big event bounces back waves
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  that are smaller events of the same thing.
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  The Bible says there's many antichrists.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  There's one big antichrist,
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  but time-space, it's bouncing back like sonar or radar,
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  and it's so powerful in the future.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  It's creating ripple effects
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  that create microcosms of the same thing.
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  You understand?
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  Yes. Yes, I 100% agree.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  I'd like to say, too, I ordered a couple.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  We got some of your shirts in, too.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  I ordered some of your shirts.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  Awesome shirts, as well.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  I love your shirts that we got in high quality.
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  Well, brother, thank you so much, and I love you.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  And I haven't even plugged the last two hours.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  I've been so wound up.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  I hate coming on here and saying,
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  hey, better buy my videos, better buy my books,
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  better buy my supplements, better buy what we're here.
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  But literally, we're just barely here.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  And I hate to give the enemy that nose.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  That makes them all happy and everything.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  But you know what?
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  We've held through, and most people failed,
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  so I'm proud of what we did.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  They'll have part of me just once some time.
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  They'll just smash me and get rid of me,
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  so I'll keep fighting hard.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  But that's just one side of me.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  Let's just say this.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  It's all God's will now.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  We got Baby Lives Matter shirts,
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  Terry Response Teams.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  These are all pieces of history.
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  Jared, thank you.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  All right, I'm going to be a good boy now.
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  I took one call this hour.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  You got my absolute commitment to take every caller on the board.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  Matt, Brock, Austin, Jared, Steve, John, Kevin, Patrick,
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  and many others.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  We're going to go to break.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  We're going to come back and take your calls.
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  I mean, it's just so, I mean, the new emails they just released,
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  Giuliani just released, which they're not even denying
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  are real emails.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  These are real emails where, hey, you give me money,
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  30 million, you get stuff done.
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  I mean, it's like, put the handcuffs on.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  You can have a week-long trial.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  They're convicted.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  The full new information is on infowarstore.com.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  And all I can say is, damn, Giuliani's definitely
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  Trump's big asset, because he's risking his life doing this.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  I mean, if I was Giuliani, I wouldn't be getting on
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  airplanes any time soon.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  That guy's got some way of us.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  But so do we.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  That's a good part about this fight.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  We got the balls.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  All they got is their Satanism.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  are supposed controllers and bosses.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  The great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  has come out and said, nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  You get a lot of sunlight.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  It's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  And it's almost impossible to get viral infections
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  because you're getting plenty of vitamin D3
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  if you have zinc and vitamin C as well.
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  That's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Now, I've pointed this out.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  And the media has called me a scammer for saying
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  that there's hope that people should have their vitamins
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  and their minerals.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Well, now Fauci's been forced to come out
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  He should have also added zinc because the NIH website
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  says you die without zinc.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  in reality because so many doctors and nurses
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  We've confirmed from high level sources in our own research
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  that if Joe Biden's able to steal the election
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy.
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  They intend to not just shut down in full force
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  Now, here's the really bad news.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  They're coming after everybody
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  and they're coming after the economy
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  for supporting Donald Trump
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  But here's the really good news.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  The really good news.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Humanity is awakening to this threat.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  We're no longer asleep
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  and we understand that the globalists are our mortal enemies
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  That's why we must come together now as Americans
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  of erased color and creed
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  and repudiate the New World Order
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  but also the information war
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  support independent media that tells the truth
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  like Infowars.com. Thank you.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  I have to tell you, this is very sensitive.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  The stuff that we're in possession of contains
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  a thousand, maybe more photographs
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  that are highly, highly
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  anywhere from inappropriate to illegal
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  and have to be possessed by the Chinese government.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  If the Chinese government doesn't have these photographs,
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  they're not really a rival.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  I mean, I did intelligence work.
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  I helped to start the flies the court.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  I know this business and I know
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  the Cold War people better than I do the people now.
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  All my flies are warrants who are against China and Russia.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  They have got everything the American people
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  are going to look at in the next five days.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  China's been looking at for a long time.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  And you heard that. They're going to roll this out over five days.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  So we're into day two now.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  The new emails are on Infowars.com.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  I just covered them.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  And it's
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Honor Biden saying, look, you agreed to 30 million for me to introduce you to my dad.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Now, part of the deal of us, given what you want is a percentage of the money as well.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  So it's open and shut. It's bombshell.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  And that's why the criminals
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  are involved in obstruction of justice,
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  aiding in a betting, giving soccer.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  It's just organized crime.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  By big tech.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  But, you know, the FBI will do nothing and Congress will do nothing,
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  but probably stick their thumbs up their air ends.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  And I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what I expect.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  Okay, who's been holding the longest? Is it Matt?
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  Is it
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  John? Is it DJ? Is it
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  who's been holding the longest here?
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in New York.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Steve, welcome.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  Hey, what's up, Alex? Thanks for taking my call.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Man, we're living history, brother.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Is this not incredible?
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  There is an incredible moment in history.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  And what we need to do now that big tech
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  is completely shadow banning everything
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  on Twitter, on Facebook.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  We need to politically attack more than ever
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  we have before starting right now.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  We are controlling the narrative as of right now.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  With mainstream media, big tech in the leftist control of the narrative,
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  we have to keep fighting in a harder way.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  But now that we are on the attack,
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  we have the headline of Hunter Biden
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  and possibly the Bengali thing that's going on.
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  We have to attack. We cannot be silent anymore.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  An attack on every platform imaginable.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  No, I totally agree. That's why we've got man.video.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  That's why we've got infowars.com.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  They're shutting everything else down.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  And this is why this is so serious, brother.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  They're shutting you down since...
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Oh, it's usually the first platform to be shut down.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:47.000]  I have a big following on Instagram,
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  on TikTok, which is a conservative app.
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  And I've been shadow banned.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  Nobody sees my videos and it's everybody.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  It's all two centers and every platform.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:59.000]  And it's time to attack big techs like we've ever had before.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.000]  I mean, I agree. Listen, I'm not a fascist.
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  I'm not an authoritarian.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:07.000]  They're the ones shutting down info,
[1:58:07.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  blocking the government, blocking Congress.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  George Washington would just order troops to occupy these facilities.
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  It would be a no-brainer.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  He'd just sign the order. That'd be it.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  America would back it because they'd know.
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  And if they didn't see the controlled information,
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  it was him freeing information.
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:24.000]  But they're trying...
[1:58:24.000 --> 1:58:26.000]  I don't think they think Trump will do it.
[1:58:26.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  I think they'll roll over immediately.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  I think they ought to have special operations from the Army
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  take over big tech right now.
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  I'm serious.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  I completely agree. I think some sort of way
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  the military needs to get involved
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.000]  and we need to shut this down.
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  People go, oh, you want... No, no, no.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  We already have big tech operating as a government
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  because of the chicoms. So my military better protect me now.
[1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  Yep. And then they're going to try and attempt to call Trump a dictator
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  while he does this. But what other ways to do it?
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:58.000]  We have to break up big tech. It's just a monopoly.
[1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  It's way bigger than the government.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:02.000]  It's surveilling more than...
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  If the NSA was doing this, I'd say arrest them.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  Yep. It's everybody gets their information from it.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:09.000]  No one... You know, this is...
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:11.000]  It's just time to break it up altogether.
[1:59:11.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  It's time to arrest these people.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  That's right. The courts are controlled. You can't do it that way.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  I mean, I'm serious. The FBI won't do their job.
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  The U.S. Army needs to do it.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  By the way, that's historically who deals with stuff domestically in the United States.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  You've got Posse Commentaris. They claim the Marines can handle it.
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  I don't think the Marines are big enough force to do this.
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  I mean, they could be attached to the Army if they want.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  And folks, I don't just say this. I really mean this, okay?
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:39.000]  I mean, the Chinese government is literally attacking us
[1:59:39.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  and threatening to blow our ships up right now
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  in the name of the Democrats.
[1:59:44.000 --> 2:00:13.000]  Stop it! Stop it now!
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  No more pesky law and order.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  But wait. Vote for Democrats now and bill include rolling blackouts,
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  We're even fighting against this guy. But you know what? They're a powerful party.
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  They're a very corrupt party. They're in bed with the media, the fake news, right back there.
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  And totally protected by Big Tech.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  If I said what he said, they'd be calling for me out of there in 24 hours,
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  what this guy has said.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  Two days ago, he said, I'm running for the United States Senate.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  That's the third time he said, I'm running for the...
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  No, that's not, look, that's not like a regular, like, mistake.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  You can make mistakes.
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  He said that and he said other things, but we won't even get into it.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  This is crazy. This is the craziest race.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  You know what? I'm running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  and if I lose, it puts more pressure.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  I wish he was good. I wish he was good. I'd have less pressure.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  I mean, how do you lose to a guy like this? How do you lose to a guy like this?
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  And by the way, we're leading in North Carolina.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:15.000]  And the same speech he said, communist China wins if I lose.
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  They've done one-sided deals with middlemen. They're screwing you over.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  We're going to fix those and he's got a plan to do it.
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  That's what he said just an hour ago.
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  Here's what he said last night as well. Here it is.
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  China wins. China will own the United States.
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  And I turned it all around and you know that better than anybody.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  In 2019, if you go back 10 years, everybody projected 2019,
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  the economy of China was going to be bigger than the U.S.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  except it didn't happen because I got elected and I turned it the opposite way.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  We were picking up much more than them.
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  And then I did the no dumping steal and I did tariffs and I did everything on them.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  No, no, they want Sleepy Joe to win.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  And if he does, if Sleepy Joe wins, China will own the United States.
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  And that's literally what's happening.
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  Someone explained a threat continuum. I don't want to kill somebody breaking into my house.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  I don't want to deal with the cops. I don't want to kill somebody.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  There's a little bloody dead body, blood around their mouth.
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  They look pathetic. It's a problem.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  A crap on your floor a lot of times.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  You know, you got to clean them out of your house.
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  But if you come to my house, well, my family's there.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  I'm going to kill you dead in a hammer.
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  And you know, it's the same message as the global.
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  It's like Catherine Austin Fitz was using the analogy from Yellowstone.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  I've only watched a few episodes because one of my buddies is on their steiner brother and dad are on the show.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  But they got like these bad guy lawyers trying to take their ranch over and they've done all this violent stuff and finally they've gone.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  They're about to kill them.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  And the ranching family says, why'd you make us kill you?
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  I like we didn't want to kill you, but we're going to kill you now.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  They go, well, no one ever stood up to us before.
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  And you know what? That is such a deep statement.
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  It seems so simple.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  Like no one's ever stood up to these people.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  And so I'm Mr. Anti-Police State.
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  I'm Mr. Anti-Surveillance.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  But that doesn't mean I'm against the police and military.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  We have that when big organized groups attack us, they're supposed to do something.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  And China is all over their major news saying, we're going to blow up US bases in Asia.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  We're going to nuke the United States.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  They've got flyover threatening to bomb Hong Kong.
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  And they're literally owning our media threatening us.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  And I'm just sick of it, man.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  But let me tell you, China would give up real quick if Hollywood and the Democrats were not so arrogant,
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  but they've never gotten in trouble.
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:57.000]  You know, if I was working with the foreign power trying to overthrow the US, trying to kill the dollar,
[2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:07.000]  I would expect in the old days I'd walk out to my car and a former person associated with the Green Berets would break my neck.
[2:05:07.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  Wouldn't be somebody in the Green Berets, somebody formerly associated with it.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  They'd break my neck.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  That was back when the country was free.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  Because if I worked for a foreign power, if I tried to actually overthrow the government,
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  I wasn't a citizen then, I would just get my neck broken.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  Or I'd commit suicide in the garage with, you know, the car on.
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  I wouldn't really commit suicide.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  They'd kill me.
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  But see, we don't have that anymore.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  That's all been gotten rid of.
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  And instead, we just have chai comms in the left killing people and pissing and pedophiles running everything.
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:41.000]  And it just goes on and on and on and no one respects us.
[2:05:41.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  And we're a big joke.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:45.000]  And China's got this 5 million man army.
[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  And they're taking the whole planet over and big tech grovels to them.
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  They have respect for them.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  They have no respect for us.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:01.000]  But I guarantee you, if one of the heads of big tech tonight fell down their stairs and broke their neck,
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:03.000]  and I'm not calling for that.
[2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:17.000]  I'm just saying, if Tim Cook or Bill Gates or Jack Dorsey or Sundar Pichai or Eric Schmidt fell down their stairs tonight
[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  and bounced their little head up against the wall and broke their neck,
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  there'd be pissing themselves tomorrow stopping what they're doing.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  But our weakness has opened a channel up for them to then screw us constantly, eternally, ongoing.
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  And then we wonder why we're on the edge of nuclear war.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:47.000]  And it's because we've got a bunch of weirdo tech people running everything.
[2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  Just saying.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  So I'm not a general, and I'm not up here calling shots.
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  All I know is I call what I see going down.
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  And I said, I'm going to your phone calls.
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  I said, I'll take them all the stars.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  I'm going to shut up now.
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  But 18 days out from the election, big tech works with China.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  They're screwing the country.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  They literally want a civil war.
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  They're out of control.
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  And it's going to cause millions of dead, probably, if this keeps going this way.
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  And I just want to stop.
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  I just want to see that the president doesn't have a few good men.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  The truth is, we're a soft country.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  I'm soft too.
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  People can't keep their mouth shut.
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  And instead, we've got all these leftists walking around out there going to kill this person.
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  Oh, yeah, you're not going to kill anybody, fat ass.
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  And, you know, all these big, in fact, let's play the Democratic Party Chairman or whatever in Denver.
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  Let's play him and go to Brighton.
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  Come back with the calls.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  Let's play the latest Project Veritas I didn't get to yesterday,
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:51.000]  where he's got all these dreams of guillotines and the rest of it.
[2:07:51.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  And, you know, actually, we're so weak, we'd probably all give them our kids here.
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  Put them in a guillotine, sir.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  But here it is.
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  2020 is a political revolution.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  I am going to do everything morally acceptable to win.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  I will lie.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  I will cheat.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  I will steal, because that's morally acceptable in this political environment.
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  This is Chris Jax from Our Revolution,
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  a radical-left 501c4 organization bent on creating a, quote,
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  political revolution in the United States.
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  Jax represents the Democratic Party here in Colorado.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  And Jax says a Biden administration will be used to advance his political objectives,
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  or else there will be violence.
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  He's going to take a stricter kit against the 21% of those who try.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  Because that's who it is.
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  It's killing random Nazis in the street.
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  Random shit.
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  Blue liquors.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  So you want to do some versatile shit.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  You want to do some anti-pissed shit.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  You want to change this country that way with violence.
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  That's the only one way to do it.
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  You got to get people that are close to dying groups
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  and start just random billing or start turning them down.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  I mean, Bezos at the top of the list.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:03.000]  Hi, Paul.
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  Bezos funds this guy's actual group.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  Let's just continue.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  You always have to have somebody that's willing to hold up the flag
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  and say, no, this is the line in the sand,
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  and we're the ones holding that line.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  But they ain't stabbing motherf***ers like they used to.
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  They don't have to though, because they used to stab them.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  Oh, I hit pause.
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  I don't want to act tough, but for charity,
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  I will get in the ring with this guy with baseball bats.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  Mr. Jax is so tough.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  Hey, Jax, let's get in the ring three rounds with baseball bats.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  You won't survive 30 seconds.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  In fact, your baseball bat can have nails in it.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  I would love to get in the ring with that guy, man.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  I mean, he's such a full of it piece of crap, man.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  He wants to go out.
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  He wants to kill people.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  He wants blood.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  He wants power because he's never done that.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  He has no idea what that's all about.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  And all I'm saying is we're doing OK.
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  I'm going to be a good boy.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  I'm going to stop now.
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  You've been holding a while.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Austin and Kevin.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  Been holding the longest at DJ Tim, Patrick, Mel, Jared, Brooke, everybody.
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  What a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  What a time to be alive.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  What a time to be alive.
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  What an incredible time to be here.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  Remember, remember, remember, remember.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  They hate it when you share the live links to the show on your private email,
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  your private texts with a few areas not totally censored.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Now do it while you still can.
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  Jam it up the globalists.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  You know what?
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  And tell folks about those local radio stations.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrated.
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  Some like bodies better.
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  and so much more.
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  And they fund the InfoWare.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  So get our new Liquid Timerick Extract exclusively.

[2:12:15.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  Bill Gates or vaccines or adverse reactions will be allowed.
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  And of course, they've passed a law saying that when you get sick from the inoculations,
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  they will have liability protection.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  The perfect storm.
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  Oh, of course, if you look at Alphabet, the parent company of Google and, of course, YouTube,
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  they just so happen to be heavily invested in hundreds of big pharma companies
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  and over a dozen big vaccine makers.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:41.000]  And they're invested with, you guessed it, Billy Boy Gates.
[2:12:41.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  So the electronic straight jacket and gag is going on us right now.
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  I suggest we take action and Congress take action now.
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  All right, let's go to your phone calls right now on this October 15th global transmission.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.000]  Let's talk to Kevin in Iowa.
[2:13:23.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  Yes, I'm an electronics technician engineer.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  And one way to keep the internet going, I think would be to make sure that they can't get their propaganda out.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  And how do we do that?
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  We have to take out the STLs that go to the transmitter.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  And it's pretty basic.
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  Instead of shooting people shoot the STLs out.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  What this will do, and I'm talking about all stations that don't carry out the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  This will pretty much ensure that they can't get their propaganda out.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  You're talking about the repeater systems.
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  Pardon?
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  The repeaters.
[2:14:09.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  The local emergency station repeating systems.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  The STLs are the studio to transmitter link for the local reporting.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:24.000]  If they can't.
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  I was going the backwards way.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  I know those are connect, at least in the past, those are connected to a emergency response national emergency hookup.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  I'm not an engineer.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  Explain exactly what you're saying.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  If they can't get their, the STL, if the STL goes down, they'll just say I used to work for KCRG Cedar Rapids.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  I understand.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  So you're saying it's the local station link to the main station that's broadcasting the satellite link.
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  That's taken out.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  They've got to do local programming.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Located on the tower about halfway.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  Okay.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.000]  You're talking about the EAS takeover uplink.
[2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  No.
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  Yeah, it's like that EAS system is at the studio.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  I understand.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  So you say take out the interface at the tower.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:13.000]  Yep.
[2:15:13.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  And that way, and if that doesn't work, go for the transmission line right in the center of the tower.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  And what this will do, it'll buy us a little bit of time.
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  It'll take a long time to fix that.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  And those guys make $250 an hour getting up there.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:37.000]  Maybe more now because that was in the 90s, they were making $250 an hour.
[2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  But if that's done, they can't get their information to their little squads on the ground through their, whatever, what they've talked.
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  And also, that'll keep people from not watching TV and be watchful for other things.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  And they won't be able to take the internet down because...
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  I was about to say then, they're going to see radio and TV as secondary.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  Wouldn't it be cell towers as the primary target?
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  I mean, hypothetically, I would ever do this, but just five gallons of gasoline will take out any cell tower.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  But I just had my phone line cut and I was using the phone line to listen to your program.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  And that's pretty dastardly.
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  And then they did it right at the end of the billing cycle, magically.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  Brother, I know everything's a scam. I appreciate your call.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  I want to be clear. I don't want to cut any communications.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  But they are taking communications over and blocking Congress as Twitter and Facebook are doing.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  That's an act of war.
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  So I get the public's thinking about, oh, they're going to use communications.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:58.000]  We'd rather just have a station owner that just goes in and bypasses the EAS and tells the truth.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  And then no one ever even knows how EAS works.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  There's no enforcement. They have no power.
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  We just need good people at the radio stations to tell the truth during a crisis or to laugh at whatever comes down the EAS.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  You can tell that wasn't engineer folks.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  We're getting into engineer talk and stuff here that I've tried to study, so I don't mean to get us off on a side issue.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  I'm glad to call our call, but it is somewhat of a rabbit trail.
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  Okay, holding the longest now would be done, done, done.
[2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  Austin and DC. Austin, thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  Alex, it's great to speak with you.
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  I wanted to just kind of throw out there that, you know, us conservatives really need to organize more.
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  I don't know how we would do it, but I mean, we see BLM and Antifa, they're so dang organized.
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  And we've got to be able to compete with that.
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  But besides that, I wanted to mention that I think our high ranking military officials are still operating under this U.S. Army field guide,
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  field manual that was put out in 1979, and it's basically a PSYOP operation.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:09.000]  They declare it as obsolete now, but I believe our high ranking military officials are still operating under that.
[2:18:09.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  And it details, you know, PSYOP and support of prisoners of war and civilian interneed programs here in the U.S. with U.S. civilians.
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And it's, and it's crazy stuff.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  So you're talking about a precursor of X-84?
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  Yes. Yeah, it was put out in 1979.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:32.000]  Yeah, that's an operating manual we'll talk about for emergency COG during times of nuclear war in 1979.
[2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:36.000]  I'm familiar with that. That's a founding document of FEMA.
[2:18:36.000 --> 2:18:41.000]  So that, do you believe our high ranking military officials are still operating under this?
[2:18:41.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  I know they are, and that's how they artificially created the COG, which itself is connected to the State Department of Random 7277
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  and other Carnegie agreements, where they sent the generals to these brainwashing facilities to teach them about world peace
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  and to see who would believe it, who wouldn't, to then stack the deck and that goes back to the bigger problem of how many of the military leadership is actually globalist,
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  like this top army official saying, we'll never take off the mask and we'll never, you know, all this is going to happen.
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  These people have been chosen because they follow orders, not from the president, but from the permanent bureaucracy, which the trilateral commission has put in place.
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  Exactly. I mean, and it talks about augmentation and cellular organization of shadow government.
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  It's absolutely insane to take over our current government and to replace it with a socialist state.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  It more comfortably merges with the Soviet Union.
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  I mean, that was never, it's not the Soviet Union doing it.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:45.000]  The argument was disarm America to merge the Soviet Union to end war.
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  But now today it's like in the patriarchy, in men, in conflict, see how it's the same story.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  In fighting, let us be in charge. Give up your guns, only we'll have the guns. See how that works?
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Yes, sir. And they'll never take our guns. They'll have to take them by force because we'll never give them up freely, buddy.
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:08.000]  I hear you. God bless you, Austin. Great points. All right, up next hole in the longest would be...
[2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Brock in Florida. Brock, welcome.
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  Hey, Alex. I'm on the air.
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  All right. I just wanted to call in and, you know, reinforce that people are waking up to all this.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  I work at a restaurant in Orlando, Florida, which everybody knows is a fairly liberal area.
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  And I get guests coming in every day and they start talking about the election.
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:40.000]  And, you know, I start going into like Bill Gates and Fauci and they'll cut me off and they'll take the words right out of my mouth in your mouth.
[2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  And they're like, yeah, I know he's under investigation in India. He's corrupt. He's banned out there.
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  He's a eugenicist. And I'll be like, whoa, I mean, do you watch Info Wars?
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  They're like, no, but like, look at what he's up to. And they're taking the words right out of mine in your mouth.
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  And, you know, I've got friends and family calling me too.
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  And they're asking me about Bill Gates and what he's been up to.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  And, you know, it's really inspiring to me and about how alert people are becoming to it.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  And I just wanted to share that with you.
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  Brock, don't hang up. I want to come back to you. I want to hear more about this when we come back.
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Because absolutely, again, my dentist is my dad just retired a year ago.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  My new dentist doesn't know who I am. He knows I'm a radio host and he's literally sitting there yesterday
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  putting an implant in, you know, a post for it on my teeth broke apart.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  And he's like, yeah, Alex, I don't like Bill Gates when he's doing it.
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  I'm like, do you know who I am? No, he's telling me about how Bill Gates is bad.
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  He doesn't know who I am. And this is the good news is the pushback is beautiful.
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  Stay there, sir. We'll come right back to you.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack. And I'm really bummed out about that.
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and sort of reordering it.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:06.000]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown, because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack,
[2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  we are unable to secure it anymore. This is the highest in AMPM pack system you're going to find
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  where you take half the pills in the morning, half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  It's amazing. I don't have time to go into everything that's in it,
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:24.000]  but this gets people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  So it's your last chance to get a power stack at InfoWareStore.com.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  It's 60% off and free shipping. That is at cost for all of you that already support InfoWare.
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  We're passing these savings on to you to your APAC power stack now or you still can.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  The last chance to get it, InfoWareStore.com.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  APAC power stack, 60% off and free shipping.
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:53.000]  Finally, the stagnant Republican establishment understands what InfoWare understands,
[2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  what our listeners understand, what Donald Trump understands.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  We're in a digital civil war. There are giant filters filtering out 99% of communication going on
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  on every major tech platform and now they're doing it to the private apps.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  They're doing it to text messages. They're doing it to email.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  This is mafia-organized crime election meddling.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  But finally, when they blocked Hunter Biden and the barisma information
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  and the Chinese information and the photos and the crack pipes and all the rest of it,
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  it's been confirmed to be real. Biden hasn't denied it.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  Finally, Congress got pissed and said, this is out of control.
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  You've got to stop it now. We're taking action.
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  Oh, and Jack Dorsey went, oh, it's a mistake. It's an accident. It's an accident.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  But they keep pushing and pushing because no one ever calls their bluff.
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  Well, InfoWare is calling their bluff.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  Thank you all for keeping us on the air.
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  The system is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  Trump has finally figured this out and since he's going to take action,
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  once re-elected, he gets big tech. I mean, he's a modern situation.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now,
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  so we're going to sit here and cry because he has taken action.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:35.000]  We the people are taking action now.
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  You can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com,
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  with weElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new redesigned InfoWare.com and share that link.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  Oh, that really upsets them. Oh, yeah.
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  You can hear it.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  You can hear it.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  The stronger it gets.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  Frank this up.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  You can face it.
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  You can take it.
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  I always get into it right now.
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  Your balls are amazing.
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  Rock in Florida.
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  Some of the awakening service industry worker.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  What he's saying, and the most beautiful thing is,
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  they've tried to turn brown people against white people,
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  and it's actually had the opposite effect with everybody I know,
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  and had people come together.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  It's a beautiful thing.
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  Yeah, we got countless videos of racist black people,
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  you know, killing white people,
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  but that's statistically manipulated.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  That's not the average black folks doing that.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:19.000]  It is way more often than whites do it.
[2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  People go, well, then look, the blacks are bad.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  You don't judge somebody off what individuals do.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  You judge them off what they do.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  You don't judge somebody off a group.
[2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  You judge them off what they did.
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  And statistically, it's still very rare to be killed by a black person
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  or a white person, even though it's 10 times more likely
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  than a white person killing a black person.
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  Just like a cop killing a black dude in wrong, I mean, like 14 a year,
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  out of 370 million people, I'm not here to defend police.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  I'm here to defend reality.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  And again, the idea that the police are out hunting blacks,
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  the average white cop, black cops afraid to even respond to a black person
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  because they know the media is watching them.
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  And think about that lawlessness and what that does to black communities
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  when cops won't respond to black communities
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  and cops won't stop a black guy attacking his wife
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  or cops won't respond to a drug dealer attacking a family.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  Who's that hurt?
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Well, we know in Chicago, 2,000 black men a year on average die from other black men
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  and there's no response.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  That systemic racism.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  That the cops are so paralyzed.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  But that Florida footage, the black lady calls the white cop,
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  she knows she was calling, she called 911.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  Like three white cops, one black cop show up.
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  Cops walked in, guy shoots a cop right in the chest.
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  Black lives matter rioted because they shot the guy that shot the cop.
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  That's crazy.
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  Because they want to take over our government, folks.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  And it's not black people taking our government over.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  It's George Soros.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  Now there's the footage.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:08.000]  Black lady calls a white cop.
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  He gets shot in the chest and he's the bad guy.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  When he gets shot and gets up and kills the guy that attacked him.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  That's called being retarded, folks, that people are mad about that.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:22.000]  And again, it's not about the fence of the police.
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  It's about the fence of reality.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  I'm finishing up your point from Florida.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  You're making a great point about the big awakening you're seeing.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  Just one more thing I wanted to press on about the election.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  Attorney General Barr needs to go on the attack right now.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  If he's not going to attack, we need to start calling him out on it.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  Conservatives, liberals, whoever just believes it and right and wrong.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Well, his argument is he's not making it political with all the crick.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  He's killed a bunch of cases.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  Let me give the inside baseball and I'm not defending Barr.
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:28:59.000]  But this is the truth.
[2:28:59.000 --> 2:29:02.000]  This is what really is going on in his head.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  The Democrats have 15 cases against Trump.
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:08.000]  And I shouldn't even give this out, but the truth is the truth.
[2:29:08.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  Because media matters will get this, but they already know this.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  There's a 15 cases against Trump in one district alone.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  There's a bunch of other cases.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  They've killed those saying it's political way to last the election.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  And so they've got to kill the others.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:23.000]  So does that make sense?
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  And, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not a fly on the wall in the White House.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  And so, I mean, like, I really don't know what's going through his head.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  I'm just believe me.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  I am.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  But then you see Trump pissed at Barr, not doing anything.
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  Trump does nothing.
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  Trump's like, I don't care if they're investigating me in the Southern District.
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  I don't care.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  And Barr's like, oh, no, no, because he's, you know, they've stopped all the investigations
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  until after the election, not just the ones against Trump.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  They've killed them all.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  That's a fair point.
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  You know, I really, you know,
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  Well, no, no, I'm telling you, I actually, I want to get into it.
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  Just I got it from a very high level source is below the president.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  But I don't have this.
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  You have.
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:03.000]  I guess I'm not that brother.
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  You got your own common sense.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  That's 30 thing I got.
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  I love you.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:07.000]  And I appreciate you.
[2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  No, I hear what you're saying.
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  Absolutely.
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  What you're saying, I just, I'm in a level of information that I get what's really going
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  on from their perspective.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  And these people don't BS me.
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:17.000]  I mean, believe it, they BS me.
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  I'll come after them so fast to make your head spin.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  They get the only currencies being honest.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  They're like, uh, there's like a hundred investigations of Republicans high level
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  right now and we're killing all those and we're killing the investigation on Democrats.
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  So that's what's going on.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  Everybody gets so pissed off about it.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  I mean, I agree with Trump.
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  Trump says, Hey, bar, you're wrong.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  I don't care if they're investigating me.
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:48.000]  Let them have their charges.
[2:30:48.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  I'm just telling you what's going on.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  All right, let's take another call here.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:56.000]  Let's talk to Matt in Oregon.
[2:30:56.000 --> 2:30:57.000]  Matt, you're on the air.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  Thanks for holding.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:30:59.000]  Go ahead.
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:03.000]  Hey, Alex, I am a Bible believing preacher here out in Portland, Oregon.
[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  And I appreciate the truth that you are pumping through that station every single day.
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  Praise Jesus, brother.
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  Amen.
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  I, I agree with what you're saying.
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:14.000]  And I think there's some good news coming in my opinion.
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  I do think Trump is the man that God has brought for this country.
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  So there's no doubt about that.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  Is Satan not upset?
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  Yep.
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  And he hasn't even gotten started.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  I really think that the Lord is going to give him four more years.
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:28.000]  I think he's going to take out the deep state.
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  I think Q is going to take the credit for it.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  And it's probably a arm of the deep state in some way that's going to try to bring a
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  bunch of people on their side.
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  But here's the thing in the Bible.
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:42.000]  Heyman, he built the gallows that he was going to hang Mordecai on.
[2:31:42.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  And he ended up getting hung on his own gallows.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  And I think that's what's happening with the deep state right now.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  And you'll remember that when Heyman was preparing this whole thing, the Lord made a total idiot
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  out of him.
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  You know, he had Mordecai riding on the horse and all that whole story happened in the,
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:00.000]  in the story of Esther in the Bible.
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  And it's incredible to me just how the deep state is, the Lord is just making these guys
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  look like total idiots.
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  They picked Joe Biden, the worst possible.
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  They're all total clowns.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  They're just, God certainly gives us a choice.
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  Doesn't he like these total lying clowns or total victory?
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  Like what do you choose?
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  The only difference is Satan's rebellious.
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  Satan goes, Oh, join me.
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  I'll give you freedom.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  But Satan totally controls you.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  Yep.
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  I think the Lord's going to give Donald Trump four more years and we can thank God for that.
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:34.000]  I think the Lord is positioning the nation of Israel for what's to come in the future as
[2:32:34.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  outlined in the book of Revelation.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  But I think it's incredible.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  No, I agree.
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  You talk about that.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  This is all pre positioning for the next big move.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:42.000]  I agree.
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:45.000]  But if you look back on these times, it's easier right now.
[2:32:45.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  Right.
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  Yeah.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:48.000]  There's a lot of bad stuff coming.
[2:32:48.000 --> 2:32:51.000]  I do think there's a bit of, maybe a bit of a golden age in a way coming.
[2:32:51.000 --> 2:32:54.000]  I think, like I said, if you're going to take out the deep state, these people are criminals.
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  I think he's going to do it.
[2:32:55.000 --> 2:32:59.000]  And I think the church is going to go into apostasy because in addition to a deep state,
[2:32:59.000 --> 2:33:04.000]  we have a deep church and that's the, I believe the Roman Catholic system and that thing has
[2:33:04.000 --> 2:33:05.000]  to be addressed.
[2:33:05.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  That thing is covered top to bottom with pedophiles.
[2:33:07.000 --> 2:33:12.000]  You know, Pope Francis is a total globalist ecumenist and I think eventually Trump's going
[2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  to have to go toe to toe with Pope Francis as well.
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  Well, there's no doubt that the leader of the Catholic church is trying to destroy the
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  Catholic church and set up world governments.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  You can say whatever you want about whether it was good or whether it was bad.
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  There's no doubt that it's evil right now.
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  Thank you so much.
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  Russell in California.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  Thanks for holding Russell.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  Go ahead.
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing?
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  Man, I'm just, I get wound up.
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:37.000]  It's such an epic time, brother.
[2:33:37.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  Yeah, I know.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  Hey, I'm one of the subjects I wanted to bring up was that, you know, everybody seems to
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  be under the spell of the white privilege of social media saviors, the Zuckerberg in them.
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  They are not that smart to be orchestrating everything that's going on right now.
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  I point the finger at the CIA and the NSA because they're the only ones who could pull off the
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  assassination of JFK.
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  They're the only ones who could stage 9-11.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  They're the ones that are behind the scenes directing them with the Obama's and the Bush's
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  and the Clinton.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  You know, you talk about Roy X-84 and the shadow government.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  I honestly believe they are not in our best interest.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  I agree with you, Russell.
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  So let's be clear, Russell.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  I get everything you're saying since the very start, but right up front, I miss what you're
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  saying.
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  So explain to me your view on this when we come back.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  Russell, straight ahead, stay with us.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  Stay with us and spread those links.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  We've confirmed from high-level sources in our own research that if Joe Biden's able to
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  steal the election, and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy, they intend
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  to not just shut down info wars but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  And here's the really bad news.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  They're coming after everybody, and they're coming after the economy, and they want to
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  all the trash.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  But here's the really good news.
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  The really good news.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  Humanity is awakening to this threat.
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  We're no longer asleep, and we understand that the Globals are our mortal enemies, and
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  That's why we must come together now as Americans, every race, color, and creed, and repudiate
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  the New World Order and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump, but also the information
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  war, support independent media that tells the truth, like infowars.com.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  Thank you.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  There's only five days left in the info wars total blowout mega sale.
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  Five days left.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:57.000]  I want to thank you all for your support because things are so unstable and so crazy, and the
[2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:59.000]  supply chains are breaking down.
[2:35:59.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  I made the decision a month ago to sell out of our inventory and then to readjust and
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  even see we're going to be able to continue on in the future with this model of funding
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  or operations by selling high quality supplements for their products.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  And thanks to your support, we've gotten in enough money to reorder most of the best sellers.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  We still have a lot of our best selling items available, but they're selling out very, very
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  quickly.
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  We still have 30 to 60% off free shipping and the big thing triple patriot points.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:31.000]  That's 15% off on your next order.
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  And you sign up for auto shipping additional 10% off.
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  So some of these deals are so good, we lose money on the products.
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  But regardless, it gets money into our coffers in the short term to continue the fight.
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  Things are so critical right now with the election.
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  Be sure to visit the site infowarstore.com.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  A major life lesson just took place last night.
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  The top story in the country was that Hunter Biden's laptop information had come out.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  Him with hookers and shooting porno movies and crack pipes.
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  But the real news was how he had indeed been bought off by Barisma and had done so at the
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:12.000]  behest of his father who was getting large parts of the money.
[2:37:12.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  See Twitter and Facebook and others totally censored info and even censored major news
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  publications and even censored the president.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  But when the president and Congress said they were going to take action, suddenly Jack of
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  Twitter said he didn't know what had happened and it was wrong.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  And that's the big life lesson here.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  Standing up and saying no to organized crime without the caring is the way to stop it.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  Grobbling to it and letting big tech lie to us and run over us is the way to make these
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  tyrants continue to go absolutely crazy.
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  Remember they support Communist China and its death camps.
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  What will they do to us?
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  Well, we now know.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  is going to be your most valuable asset.
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  The world being built by the technocrats.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  The trap they've now sprung is COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  2050.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  This is their stated goal.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  We turn this around.
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  You must study their own writings.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  You must face the facts.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  And you must come to grips with it.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:17.000]  We'll talk about stay behind networks, CIA controlling the game.
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  Go ahead.
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  Give us your view.
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  Thank you for your time.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  And this brings up a subject of mine that I need to, let's say, keep confidential.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  I knew some gentlemen who were in Afghanistan trying to track down Osama bin Laden.
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  According to them, by the time they got there, all the stories they heard was that Osama
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  bin Laden had left the country to either back to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  Now that being said, there was also other Saudi Arabian operatives there building madrasas
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  and they were basically pedophile type.
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  And some of the stories they told me were just outright gassed.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  They were soon commissioned by the CIA to participate in this Torah Bora exercise where
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  Osama bin Laden was supposedly hiding in Torah Bora.
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  And it was for the benefit of the CNN and also Geraldo Rivera that they were propagating
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  this myth that he was hiding in Torah Bora.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  Now, I remember they were dropping like Moab bombs on caves.
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  Yeah.
[2:40:52.000 --> 2:41:00.000]  And so just to reiterate, you know, Mr. Steve Pachennik, I don't know much about the March
[2:41:00.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  on kind of thing.
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  But according to them, they knew full well that he wasn't there now.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  Great, great guys.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  You're talking to Russell.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  I appreciate you.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  We love you.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  All right.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  Let's go to another caller here.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jared in Florida.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  Jared, come on down.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  Amazing.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Mr. Jones, sir.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  Thank you for taking my call.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  Thank you, brother.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Go ahead.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  All right.
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  So first, I want to say I totally agree with you that action is all that matters.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  And that's why Jesus Christ said that you judge a tree by the fruit it bears.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  You don't judge it by what it says or what it thinks.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  You judge it by what it bears.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  So I totally agree with you on that certain action is what we need.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  Also, I want to comment on something you said earlier about lawyers.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:51.000]  I am a practicing lawyer and it really disturbs me that in my profession, the more elite and
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  the more prestigious you are, the more cowardly you are.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  It's always bothered me.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  Well, yeah, I'm not demonizing lawyers in general.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  That's part of our system.
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  But I'm just saying these lawyers get circles run around in my big tech who grovels to them
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  verbally, but screws them in the real action.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  So I'm just like really sick of these lawyers in Congress.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  And the reason, I'm sure you know this because I'm sure you've dealt with lawyers, but for
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  your listeners, I haven't.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  I used to work at a very prestigious firm in Texas actually.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  I have no doubt you'd recognize the name.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  And the issue is that to high powered lawyers, this is going to include AG Barr, their reputation
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  and they would rather amputate their own arm than quote unquote look unreasonable.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  And that's why these people.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  Exactly.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  They always want to look reasonable, but when they're fighting chai comms or devil worshipers,
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  there's no way to look reasonable.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  That's right.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  That's right.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  It does not look reasonable to charge a machine gun nest.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  There's nothing reasonable about that.
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  And that's why a lawyer.
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  I hate to say this because the founding fathers were lawyers, but the modern lawyer.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  Strapping a nuclear bomb on your back and going into a demon nest is not reasonable.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  No, but that, you know, lawyer will never do that.
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:08.000]  Yeah, they always play it safe.
[2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  And that's why they're banning pools.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  So they're banning dodgeball while they're banning diving boards.
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:15.000]  It's why they're now banning the family.
[2:43:15.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  They're banning vaginal birth, even though statistically the other way is more dangerous.
[2:43:19.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  It's all about how do we take control of a process?
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  Yes, sir.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:26.000]  If you got 30 questions, 30 seconds, I actually have a question for you.
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  I want your opinion on something.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  Um, I've been, uh, watching your documentaries.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  I watched in game recently and I watched your, uh, I think it was your first documentary,
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  uh, America destroyed by design.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  And something I noticed is that there were.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  Particular schemes at work that tyrants were trying to bring the fruition like, uh, the
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  trans-Texas corridor and also the, uh, the giant naval base, the deep water port in
[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  Long Beach, California that they literally tried to lease to the communist government
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  in China in the late nineties.
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  And what I noticed is that both of those things were stopped.
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  And my question for you is you were around and you saw these things.
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  What did the Patriot movement do that was able to stop those things from happening
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  and how can we apply that in the future?
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  Well, that's a great question.
[2:44:14.000 --> 2:44:18.000]  Um, anything we targeted got defeated.
[2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:20.000]  But then they said, well, why don't we even need highways?
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  We'll just take control of their governments.
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  So I appreciate your call.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  Um, you know, I made the films.
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  We exposed it.
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  I think the answer is when we fight, we win.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  When we don't fight, we lose.
[2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  Let's go to DJ and Virginia DJ.
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  Thanks for holding.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  Okay, man.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  I feel like I'm talking to my four star general, man.
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:40.000]  It's really good to talk to you.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  Well, I wish we had four star generals that are alike, brother.
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  You're the four star general.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  You called in, you held, you cared.
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:49.000]  You're in command now, Admiral.
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  Oh, awesome.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  Uh, all right.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:54.000]  Yeah, I got a few things I'd like to touch on, but if you, if you have a little time.
[2:44:54.000 --> 2:44:55.000]  Go ahead.
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  Um, I see a lot of people getting down with what's going on today and,
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  and how things are, are, are, are starting to unfold.
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  But I got some really good news.
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  Um, if you believe in Christ, we,
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  the communion prophecy has to happen in revelation.
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  There are seven different church stages.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  We are at the very last two in between the Laodicea and the Philadelphia church stage.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  Okay, nothing else has to happen for Christ's sake to make a comeback.
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  But when it says in second Timothy, when we are sorry, I was running right for it.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  I mean that we wore and entangled ourselves with not the affairs of this world.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:40.000]  So he calls for us to be a soldier that he tells us to endure.
[2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  Um, so in this time, I believe that he is right.
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  He's, uh, he's rising all the soldiers right now for the fight, which is the final fight.
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  And in my heart, I believe I'm so happy that this is happening.
[2:45:56.000 --> 2:46:01.000]  I see people getting sad and getting down, but this is prophecy that has to happen.
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:09.000]  Everything that is happening is God's will for it to happen for us to move on to the pearly gates.
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  DJ, I hear you that it's all being manifest.
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  God's words being proven true, but we've got to be politically involved and be part of the solution.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  Thanks for all.
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  I really appreciate you.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  All right.
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  Up next, Patrick in Vegas.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  Go ahead.
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  Thanks for calling.
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you doing today?
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  Man, I am wound up.
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  I mean, 18 days out, huge, the hunter stuff breaking that they're like paper play right in the emails.
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  Wow.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  That's, that's open and shut.
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  I don't know.
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  I don't know how they cover that up.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:41.000]  They can't.
[2:46:41.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  Yeah.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  Hey, I got a question.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  Uh, why doesn't Trump call out the last in the deep state about the COVID hoax?
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  Well, he's come out and said it's been over exaggerated.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  Take your mask off.
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  We should end it.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  Uh, he knows that a lot of people believe in the whole COVID deal.
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:03.000]  I mean, it is a real virus for my research that does kill a small percentage of folks.
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  So I've been a critical of Trump going along with the COVID thing, but I think lately he's been take your mask off.
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:10.000]  We've defeated COVID.
[2:47:10.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  The pandemic's over, which is true.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  Didn't kill millions of people.
[2:47:13.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  Like they said, I mean, uh, actually you asked why hasn't he come out against it?
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  I think he has.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:28.000]  Well, we should keep repeating it so everybody will understand it during his, uh, you know, his, uh, uh,
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  commentating and totally agree with you.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  But you, you know, I watched five Trump speeches since last night.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  He says it in every speech, but it's not in the news.
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  He is saying it.
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  It's being blocked.
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  We have to get it out.
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:52.000]  Well, you should, you should do it at his, uh, um, every time he stops in every state, you should say to everybody.
[2:47:52.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  No, I agree.
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:56.000]  I think he should from the Oval Office address.
[2:47:56.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  They said 2.5 million died, 200,000 died.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:01.000]  Most of those died from something else.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  They're making it political or not a bunch of cowards.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  He should call it out from the Oval Office.
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  Go ahead.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  Yep.
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  You should call it out and just get it over with.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  Well, he is.
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  I appreciate your call, but, but, but I hear what you're saying.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  He should do it even more.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  I just won't, I'm not disagreeing with you caller, but act like he hasn't done it.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  Like, oh, I could have done better with a strong man's tumble.
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  I mean, he's been, he's saying we're at war with China.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  They're working with traders.
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  They're trying to destroy us.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  I just want one sided deals to end.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  I'm trying to bring jobs back.
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  They triple charges on the drugs.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  I'm going to end that.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  Help me.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  I need you.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  I mean, he's doing that.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  So as the internet is censored and as all this garbage goes on, what are we doing on
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  the street at live news feeds or the rodeo or the baseball game or the football game
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  or the basketball game or the lacrosse game or the soccer game or the horseshoe game
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  or the video game or the whatever.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:10.000]  I mean, just everywhere you've got to decide you have power and you're saying,
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  no, male in Costa Rica.
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  You're up next on the other side as we start our number four.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  And then tonight we're going to have two different live feeds.
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:28.000]  Oh, and Shroy are covering one of the town halls.
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:33.000]  Our other great reporters covering the other, the dueling battle of town halls, two live
[2:49:33.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  feeds at band.video.
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:58.000]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  I suggest band.video.
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  tried to stop it.
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them,
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  Be sure and share band.video.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  Info Wars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  against tyranny.
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  You built Info Wars.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  You spread the word.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  You prayed for us.
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  You bought the products.
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  You called in.
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  You made recommendations.
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that, under the de-platforming, under all the
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:09.000]  With band.video, redesigned Info Wars, with all of our great crew, with documentary
[2:51:09.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  films, and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day, we are the resistance.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  You are the resistance.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  it, and to continue for you to support, because this is something we built together.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  It's not just a national treasure.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:32.000]  It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants, and they know it, and they can't stand it.
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  That's why I salute you all.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  Thank you.
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  Thank you.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:26.000]  Thank you.
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  Thank you.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  Thank you.
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  Thank you.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  Thank you.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  Thank you.
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  Thank you.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  Thank you.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  Thank you.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  Thank you.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  Thank you.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:58:14.000]  Thank you.
[2:58:14.000 --> 2:58:40.000]  Thank you.
[2:58:40.000 --> 2:59:06.000]  Thank you.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  Thank you.
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:42.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on your guest host, Jay Dyer, for this last hour.
[2:59:42.000 --> 2:59:46.000]  I want to maybe pick up where I left off in my last hosting segment.
[2:59:46.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  You can find that, of course, at 201020electioncenter.com or at band.video.
[2:59:52.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  And in that talk, I covered the relationship between the Acuminous Movement, the Ukraine, the CIA, the Jesuits, all of that.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  And I tied it into what's going on with the deep intelligence state, the military industrial complex, the paper play scheme, and Ukraine.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  And lo and behold, this week has been nothing but a bunch of vindications of everything that I talked about in that last stream.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  I remember years ago talking about the Vault 7 WikiLeaksLeaks, if you recall that, that dealt with the ability of the CIA to spoof addresses,
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:36.000]  which would then, of course, call into question the claims that these hackers had bought all these little tiny ads on Facebook.
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:38.000]  And that was what got Trump elected.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  And of course, everybody knows that that is not the case.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  It was the organic groundswell that was behind what got Trump elected.
[3:00:47.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  And in the last week, we saw, last time I was on last week, there was the DNI memo, which covered the admission that Hillary's campaign colluded to basically concoct the whole Russia hoax.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  And we saw that she was doing this to distract from her own email servers.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  And lo and behold, what comes out the last couple of days, the smoking gun in regard to Biden, Hunter Biden, and the Ukraine, right?
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  And the Ukrainian operation that was set up as a result of the coup.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  So if you remember, if we zoom out, we can put this into context.
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  There was back decades ago, billions of dollars that George Soros said the State Department helped him put into the overthrow of the Ukraine.
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  The Ukraine was then overthrown.
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  There was the Western sort of puppet guy that was put in.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  And what is this about?
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  Is this really about humanitarian operations?
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  Is it really about humanitarian cover, NGO stuff?
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  It's not really about that.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:02:00.000]  Remember, as we said last time under, I think Reagan, 80s-ish, the shift from what the CIA would do with old regime change operations went into more of a privatized operation under Reagan.
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:12.000]  So they would sort of farm that out to these humanitarian organizations that would have a new technological sophisticated way, especially now that we have Twitter and all that, to do regime change.
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  And overthrow.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  Remember, the Egyptian regime change.
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Remember, that was all fostered by Twitter, hashtags, Google, right?
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  They even bragged about the fact that they had the ability to overthrow governments now through hashtags.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  It was a big part of it.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  That smart power, soft power operation that goes on for many, many decades takes a lot of money, a lot of agitation, a lot of education.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  Then you get that key kickoff moment when you do the coup, right?
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:44.000]  When the timing is right, then you put in your puppet guy.
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  That's what happened with the Ukraine in 2013.
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  That's what that was really about.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:54.000]  Now, it wasn't really about humanitarian reasons, right?
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:56.000]  We think all the way back to Iraq.
[3:02:56.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  We think back to Desert Storm.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  We've been hearing the humanitarian clarion call, right?
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  Oh, these dictators have got to be taken down.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  Yet, magically, there's all these other dictators that we don't take down.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  So this is just obvious propaganda, right?
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  They're throwing babies out of incubators, right?
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:14.000]  This stuff.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  So we know that that is war propaganda, right?
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  But what is the war really for?
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  What is the regime change really for?
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  What is the covert operation really for?
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  It's for these pay-to-play schemes.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  Just like I said last time, remember, there was a Brookings Institute article that Hillary wrote some years before Libya.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  And Hillary said, oh, we've got to take down Gaddafi for humanitarian reasons.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  And then what comes out in the emails?
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  She's talking about Gaddafi's gold.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  I want the gold.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  Show me what a gold egg.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  Give me the gold, right?
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  That's what I thought when I first read that.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  It was Hillary.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  Hillary was thinking of the leprechaun clip and the gold.
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:58.000]  And so that's what these are really about.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  And it's no different with any other color revolution location.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:06.000]  Anyways, as you said, there have been many of these all the way back to the 90s,
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  and the first one kicking off, I think, in 2000 in Serbia with Odpor.
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  So the Orange Revolution in Ukraine involved this sort of leftist, global, deep state, operative situation
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  where they would put in their people, their guys would go in,
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  and they would be the heads of these corporations.
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  They would have the government at their disposal to just kind of divvy up the country.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  And again, the same thing happened back at the time of Serbia.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  They did the exact same thing when the West comes in.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  The West says, OK, we're going to come in.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  We're going to give you freedom now.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  You're going to get vaccines.
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  You're going to get Pepsi.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  You're going to get abortions.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  All of these things that we mandate that you get along with these big IMF loans
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  so that now your future generations are in debt to the World Bank and IMF.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  And then they have your country by the testicles for the next several decades.
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  That's how the scam works.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  But the politicians are the ones that kind of play the point, man,
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  of making the deal for the foreign governments and operatives and international entities
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  that want a piece of the pie.
[3:05:14.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  And that's exactly what pay for play is.
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:20.000]  Once you understand that, then you understand this whole geopolitical chess game.
[3:05:20.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  It's not that sophisticated.
[3:05:22.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  It's just a situation where the idea is if you donate to this campaign, you'll get a chunk of the pie.
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  Oh, you want these mines over here that produce rhodium or something.
[3:05:33.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  Oh, you want these mines over here that do the gold mines.
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  Oh, you want access to this natural resource in Ukraine.
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  OK, we'll give that to you.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  You just donate, I don't know, a million, 10 million, whatever, to this campaign fund.
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  That's how it works.
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:50.000]  It's that simple.
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:54.000]  It's just kind of a mafia tactic, but it's using the US government like a mafia.
[3:05:54.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  That's what the politicians are doing.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:02.000]  They're just using the force of the state kind of like their own privatized mafia.
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  And that's why they prostitute themselves out for that vote,
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:10.000]  not because they have any interest in the populations that they represent,
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:19.000]  but rather so that they can occupy this mobster office and sort of divvy up the spoils with their cohorts.
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  So that's what has come out with this smoking gun.
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:29.000]  We know that the deep state, especially deep state Democrats and some of those sort of McCain style Republicans.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  Remember John McCain?
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  Remember he went over to the Ukraine and he was seen on stage lecturing for this nationalism, right,
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  on the Ukrainian platforms and podiums.
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  And he's standing up there with all these, you know, so-called right-wingers,
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  which are actually right sector neo-Nazi groups that were all fake.
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  They're just operatives, right?
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  They're run by Western intelligence agencies, in my view.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  And so that's why it was so easy for McCain to do that,
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  just like when McCain would go and appear with the jihadis.
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Do you remember he did the same stuff?
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  He would just go, yeah, he would go to Ukraine.
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  He's up there on stage with all these right sector people.
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  I thought we were against neo-Nazis.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:12.000]  I thought all the John McCain can go up here with them, right?
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  He'd be up on stage talking about how Ukraine needs freedom.
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  Ukraine needs jihadis, right, and it's all for the cronies.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  There's nothing to do with these ideologies.
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  So get that in your head first, that this is not an ideological battle first and foremost,
[3:07:27.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  because remember, these are the same people that say nationalism needs to go away,
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  but they're in Ukraine agitating for Ukrainian nationalism.
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:41.000]  What? You see, it's useful to the regime.
[3:07:41.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  So Jay Daryl will be back in just a second.
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  COVID rollout has been extremely well planned, very well thought out,
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  and it's been incrementally orchestrated.
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:54.000]  First, it's 15 days to keep the hospital's empty, that's all right.
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  Then it's two months, then it's six months, then it's a year.
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  Now Bill Gates says 10 years, and people are not saying, I like my mask.
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:04.000]  I like my face diaper. I like my beaky.
[3:08:04.000 --> 3:08:07.000]  And so getting into the fear, getting into the hysteria,
[3:08:07.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  getting into all the exaggerated death numbers,
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  this is our new neurotic control freak society,
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  overseen by robots, overseen by AI,
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  and all of it is designed to make humans non-essential.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  I put out of the gates, they tell us, you are non-essential.
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  You are non-essential.
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  Your company, your restaurant, your job, your profession is non-essential.
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:41.000]  This is so incredibly authoritarian, premeditated, and Bill Gates sits on top of it.
[3:08:41.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  Come on folks, let's reject this.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:11.000]  How are you taking it? I said, I'm taking it just fine, they're coming for you next.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:14.000]  This is a technocracy, they're emerging with big pharma, they're taking it up with the media.
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  This is a digital psychological dictatorship in their own words.
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  This is a planetary takeover.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:24.000]  They're then going to start locking us in our houses using supposed plague threats.
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:29.000]  That's so the wireless system can come into place with the driverless cars and the robot takeover.
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  How did I know all this would happen?
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  Because they've been saying they're going to do it.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:38.000]  You see, it's not that I'm psychic, I know how to read what these monsters are saying.
[3:09:38.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  So you have to understand, as crazy as all this sounds, it doesn't come from me, it comes from them.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  Welcome back to our show.
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  I'm your fill-in guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  We want signed copies of my books that go deep into Hollywood.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  I've got two really, really in-depth books on Hollywood, hundreds and hundreds of five-star reviews.
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  You can go to jasonalsus.com in the shop and get signed copies of my books.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  You can also support my work by subscribing to my website, which covers in-depth lectures on geopolitics,
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  masterful tomes by Quigley, like Tragedy and Hope.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  I go and read those for you.
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  So I go and read those 1,200, 1,300 page books, and then I give you the distilled lectures.
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  All right, so I was talking about the recent news with Biden and Ukraine and his campaign suffering this huge exposure there.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  We kind of knew this was going on.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:02.000]  This is not new.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  It was rumored, it was talked about.
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  And now there is, again, documentation.
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  So big evidence, big documents coming out this last week.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  I want to tie this, though, into the bigger picture with what I talked about last time I was on,
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:26.000]  which was the usage of Jesuits, the usage of ecumenism, and how this relates to the big shake-up this week also at the Vatican.
[3:11:26.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  About a week ago, Pope Francis released his latest big encyclical, and it's about the length of a book.
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  It's a small book called Fratelli Tutti.
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  No, this is not about the Goonies.
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:39.000]  It's not about the Fratellis.
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  It's about brotherhood.
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  But what's weird about this encyclical is how brazen it is in terms of what he has planned for the future.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  Now, early on in the text, he cites his meeting last year with the Grand Imam.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  And when they got together last year, they had this special document that they signed.
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:04.000]  And this document discussed
[3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:12.000]  in sociology, global ecumenical dialogue.
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  And in fact, it even made these controversial statements like God desires there to be all of the different religions out there.
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  Now, I'm not here to attack anybody's specific religion, but rather to just point out in what sense the deep state, the global elite, the bankers, et cetera,
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  are using these religions as kind of a tool to gradually move people into a one world religion.
[3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  And this is going to tie in directly to the Ukraine, right?
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  Remember, Biden is a Catholic.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:51.000]  I'm not saying that that means that he's a bad guy because he's supposedly a Catholic, but rather the Ukraine was also achieved.
[3:12:51.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  That operation was achieved by the aid of Jesuits.
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  So we saw last week in ex-Jesuit talking about how Jesuits had gone into the Ukraine and they helped foment the ecumenical relationships that would help divide the country religiously.
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  So remember, from the perspective of the global elite, religions are tools.
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  You just use these little chess pieces and move them around to divide and conquer.
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  And so keep that in mind as we listen to what Francis, himself a famous Jesuit, writes about in his new encyclical.
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  And now what's mind-blowing is how brazen this new encyclical is in taking things to the next logical step in terms of this global religion.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:43.000]  So a year ago, not just the meeting with the Grand Imam about how all the world religions are basically all valid in a sense,
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  there was another meeting that happened that the Vatican put on called the Amazon Synod.
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:51.000]  And this dealt with indigenous peoples.
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  It dealt with the Amazon region and how the Roman Church needed to recognize and validate their conceptions of things like Pachamama.
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  Now, if you don't know what Pachamama is, I suggest looking it up.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  Pachamama, believe it or not, is a human sacrifice goddess.
[3:14:26.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  When people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine, and this always gets blown up in the media, one should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are.
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  But in most cases, there's some obfuscation at that level, and therefore there's less and less trust then in the system.
[3:14:47.000 --> 3:14:56.000]  It was the UN back in December last year said, hey, vaccines are killing people. They're untested. We need to pause vaccines. The public doesn't believe in them. The doctors don't believe in them.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  But they said, but we're just giving them by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told what to do.
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  So even the UN, the global government system itself is just a puppet. And what they say is God.
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  Halting funding for the WHO during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. The world needs them now more than ever. Well, the truth is the group actually needs Gates more than ever.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  With the U.S. taking a pause, he'll now be their largest active donor. That's right. One out of every 10 bucks that the WHO gets is from the world's second wealthiest man.
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  Again, my name is Dr. Tapper, and I'm no stranger to you as this is my third time here addressing regulations and mask mandates.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  Imagine a virus so deadly and severe that you have to have a test done to find out whether or not you've had it.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  You guys are basing these numbers on positive cases and not hospitalizations or deaths. That's what you should be basing those off of.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:16:04.000]  The numbers are hyperinflated by false positives and the never ending doom and gloom from the mainstream media. If the mask mandate turns into a vaccine mandate,
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:12.000]  you will not be allowed to go back to work, earn a paycheck, renew your driver's license or function in everyday society without proof of the vaccination.
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  We had draconian bills sweeping the nation last year coming after our medical freedoms. And then the coronavirus came. The Trojan horse to implement this tyrannical agenda.
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  They say you don't need vitamin D, then you can't say as a medical doctor you need vitamin D. They say you don't need vitamin C, but the FBI will swat team you.
[3:16:32.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  It was a special setup for this raid with the FBI putting on PPE as they went inside this medical clinic with a search warrant seeking medical records and physical evidence.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  The investigation includes allegations that the clinic provided fraudulent treatments for COVID-19 and that the clinic did not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.
[3:16:56.000 --> 3:17:04.000]  The FBI spokesperson would not say what specific treatment they were investigating except to say it was on the clinic website. We found this posting.
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  We have been using intravenous vitamin C therapy to treat COVID-19 and non-hospitalized patients with great results.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:17.000]  We've been told our whole life that vitamin D correlates with a strong immune system.
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:24.000]  Growthman points to studies that suggest vitamin D can reduce your chances of contracting COVID or the severity of your symptoms.
[3:17:24.000 --> 3:17:33.000]  He says he's tried for months to get the CDC and other experts to talk about it. Then this week, one of the nation's leading infectious disease experts did.
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:39.000]  Dr. Anthony Fauci mentioned vitamin D during an Instagram live with actress Jennifer Garner.
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  If you are deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection.
[3:17:46.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  But now Fauci said, oh wait, okay, we'll drop the charges. Fauci's God. So Fauci's God, Bill Gates's God, the UN's God, none of us have any rights.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:04.000]  But now even the UN's head envoy for global COVID-19 response comes out and says we've got to stop this.
[3:18:04.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  This is causing millions to die already. Hundreds of millions are going to die. And it's already going to be devastating, devastating to our economy.
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  It's going to put millions of people out of work. It's going to bankrupt tens of millions in the Western world.
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:27.000]  But the third world, it's already a death sentence. Millions are already dead. And I want the left and the Democrats and Fauci engaged to know we know they're behind it.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  So they can be discredited and exposed for the progenitors of the Nazis. They're not sons of the Nazis. They're not neo-Nazis. They're not Nazis.
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  They're the eugenics global scientific control freak cult that the Nazis were just a spinoff of.
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:47.000]  I've got some bad news for you. Then I've got some really bad news. Then I've got some good news.
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  The bad news is, even if Trump gets reelected, they're going to still trigger attempts at martial law, medical lockdowns, race riots, and a depression.
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  That's the globalists. They're trying to bring America to our knees.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  Now, if Trump doesn't get elected, they're still planning to bring us to our knees and really try to break our will and bring us into a super intense depression, total control,
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  and like Australia is already doing, rounding up and arresting people that criticize what the left are doing.
[3:19:13.000 --> 3:19:22.000]  That's the really bad news. The good news is, this has triggered people out of their sleep all over the world and the resistance is mounting and the globalists are panicking.
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:26.000]  So, bottom line, we're in the fight. We're starting to win, but it's serious.
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  So, pray to God for a global awakening, support InfoWars, spread the word, and buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  Literally, we're having an emergency keep InfoWars sale happening right now. Please visit InfoWarsTour and keep us on air. Thank you so much.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  I've got some really important and quite frankly bad news for you.
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:55.000]  We've confirmed from high level sources in our own research that if Joe Biden is able to steal the election and they're going to really try to do it, they're that crazy.
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  They intend to not just shut down InfoWars, but have yours truly Alex Jones arrested.
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:11.000]  And here's the really bad news. They're coming after everybody and they're coming after the economy and they want to totally gut it and punish Americans for supporting Donald Trump and repudiating Hollywood and all the trash.
[3:20:11.000 --> 3:20:18.000]  But here's the really good news. The really good news. Humanity is awakening to this threat. We're no longer asleep.
[3:20:18.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  And we understand that the globalists are our mortal enemies and we fundamentally understand that they're trying to end our nation and the free market and our Judeo-Christian roots forever.
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  That's why we must come together now as Americans of erased color and creed and repudiate the New World Order and stand firm and vote for Donald Trump, but also the information war support independent media that tells the truth like InfoWars.com. Thank you.
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying.
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  And so when you see them in concert, they've been on record saying coming up on election day and thereafter, they're not going to let anyone but, quote, authoritative sources.
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  That means CNN, New York Times, what a joke. Come out and say who the real winner is. That way they can contest the election even though Trump's declared winner, hold everything up with the ballots, then cause a constitutional crisis, call for secession and have the U.N. come in and declare the election for Biden.
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  This is what John Podesta and others are on record saying. And so when you see them in concert, censoring something like the Hunter Biden laptop story, that is a drill, that is a test to get all their systems ready, but also to condition the public that big tech works in unison to suppress speech and information.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  This is election meddling 101. This is illegal.
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that are on Apple and Androids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information. This is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit score. Get your protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks, infowarstore.com.
[3:22:46.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  I want this to sink in on this Tuesday, September 22. And it's just a time to have our head screwed on straight and get on our knees to God, because this is the big one, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  We are not living in normal times. We're living in the year 2020. But I'll tell you this, we're living in such an incredibly amazing and thought provoking and dangerous time that there was a film made in the early 1990s that described exactly what's happening, but it condensed it down to something very simple.
[3:23:42.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  Something that happened very quickly was a real weapon. It takes it to time so you never know what hit you. That way you don't see it creeping up, because we knew this was coming down.
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  We knew what they were planning. And now we're sure of it. They are going to scuttle the whole country and bring it down. It's just that simple.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  Because where this AI is taking us is a nightmare situation. But they are going to try, execute their operation, even though we're aware of it. They don't care. This is a doomsday scenario.
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  By the way, you know what the Pentagon back in the 70s called this satellite grid, hooked into the internet, tracking everything you do? They called it Skynet. And we cannot sit here and let them do it, because this country is two minutes from destruction, total annihilation, and war on the streets and everything we've built flushed down the toilet.
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:18.000]  There is red fire in the sky. To try to exterminate humanity, the technology that they have deployed and developed to replace us, we're accepting Skynet and the AI system in.
[3:25:18.000 --> 3:25:35.000]  I've said it before and I'll say it again. Resistance is victory. That simple, initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action is the most important decision you can make in the fight for freedom and human dignity.
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  Do you understand that, Soros? You think you're going to have this fight and have robots win it? No! I say to you, your technocracy is down in the limo. We are in charge of the planet.
[3:25:50.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  You pathetic maggot!
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:32.000]  You are that reaction. So understand, you are not supporters of the Info War. You're not calling it a thank me. You are the Info War. You are the Resistance. You are the future.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  So now, with 25 days out from the election, spread the word about the broadcast. Buy the products that support us to stay on air in the face of the enemy. You kept us in attack formation and pray for us. You do that trifecta. Nothing can stop you. You control your destiny. You are a victory. Take action now!
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer. A bit of a tech issue, but we're back. I was discussing the new encyclical by Pope Francis Fratelli Tutti. That's the real name. It's not a satire name.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  It has nothing to do with the Goonies, but we were talking about how the pay-for-play situation in Ukraine, it's all coming out. It's all in the mainstream now and being censored and being deleted.
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  It relates to the new Pope and the Catholic Church due to the fact that the CIA has used the Jesuits as an arm of their power structure ever since the time of Vatican II. I covered that with the Wim Hof book on John Courtney Murray and how they utilized the Jesuits for a long time.
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  This is very evident in the Ukraine where the Jesuits were agitated in concert with what we're talking about in terms of overthrowing the previous regime and putting in a new amenable to Western interest regime.
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:32.000]  This relates then to Biden. How does this relate to Francis? Well, as we saw, Francis is, of course, from the Jesuit order Pope Francis.
[3:28:32.000 --> 3:28:44.000]  In his new encyclical, he's taken the previous actions that you see in the video, Pachamama, this pagan deity that references directly to human sacrifice.
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  In fact, if you remember in Indiana Jones, when he's putting the bag of sand onto the booby trap and grabbing the gold idol, that's actually in the narrative of a gold idol of Pachamama.
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:09.000]  So they're literally worshiping, saying, Mola Ram, right? Is the Pope going to do like an acumenical meeting with Mola Ram, right, from Temple of Doom?
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  If you remember the guy wearing the big headdress and grabbing hearts and eating them, right, Mola Ram.
[3:29:16.000 --> 3:29:28.000]  So what is in, yeah, there you go. There's Pachamama right there for you, Indy's, grabbing that, taking it back to the Vatican to put in the Vatican basement, I presume, for who knows what.
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:48.000]  But Francis lays out a new path for ecumenism, which is really just the logical conclusion of the Amazon Synod and Pachamama in the last year's meeting with the Grand Imam, which is a global brotherhood of man around a new social gospel, right?
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:59.000]  The social gospel, which we saw a couple talks back when I was on, directly out of the Rockefeller's biography, they put all this money into creating the ecumenist movement and the social gospel.
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  And then here, Francis says, it's time to move into a new stage of brotherhood of humanity. Get this, he even says, no borders, no walls.
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  What? No borders, no wall. Excuse me. There's this gigantic wall called the Leonine wall around the Vatican. It's a fortified ancient wall that's like 100 feet tall.
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  But you can't have self-defense. He even calls out self-defense in this new encyclical, right?
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  So here we have a specific change in the traditional Christian understanding of self-defense.
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  All denominations, a century or two back, would have affirmed the right of self-defense, the right of even the state to exactly the death penalty, for example.
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  But Francis goes after both in this encyclical and says, really, it's time for this idea of barbaric self-defense to go away.
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  And it's connected, he says, to this idea of borders.
[3:30:53.000 --> 3:31:02.000]  Now, I don't know if you've ever looked at what they call the Pope Mobile, but Francis rides around on a golf cart that has bulletproof glass.
[3:31:02.000 --> 3:31:06.000]  And he's surrounded by about 30 Secret Service security detail people.
[3:31:06.000 --> 3:31:12.000]  I'm not talking about the Swiss Guard, the guys that wear those goofy costumes who are the traditional papal guardians.
[3:31:12.000 --> 3:31:15.000]  I'm talking about the security detail that he actually has.
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  And I would venture to think it's safe to assume that those security detail are strapped, right?
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:30.000]  What would be the point of having security detail and having a big bulletproof golf cart, right?
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  There you see a couple.
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:36.000]  But if you find other pictures, if you look up the article, there's one called the Pope Security Detail.
[3:31:36.000 --> 3:31:37.000]  You'll see him with about there.
[3:31:37.000 --> 3:31:38.000]  There you go.
[3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  There's the guys.
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:40.000]  There's your security guys.
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  They look just like Secret Service people for the president.
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:49.000]  But now you're not, you see, allowed to have self-defense.
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:52.000]  You're not allowed to have personal security.
[3:31:52.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  You shouldn't even have walls, no borders, no walls.
[3:31:56.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  And what does Francis throw into this groundbreaking encyclical in a bad way?
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:04.000]  He even talks about fake news and he doesn't mean it in a good way.
[3:32:04.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  He says drumming up drama, right?
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:10.000]  Causing hate over so-called fake news.
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:12.000]  We know who he's talking about.
[3:32:12.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  This encyclical is half written against Trump.
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:18.000]  I mean, it's mind-blowing really, right?
[3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:22.000]  That you've got the Pope basically writing an encyclical that has now shaken out.
[3:32:22.000 --> 3:32:23.000]  Yeah, look at all the security detail.
[3:32:23.000 --> 3:32:24.000]  You're not allowed to have there.
[3:32:24.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  Shaking up the whole Catholic world is now divided over this really controversial, almost Marxist encyclical.
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:38.000]  Really, if you look at the roots of this and we're going to go into some of the quotes from Francis here in a second when we come back after this break.
[3:32:38.000 --> 3:32:40.000]  I'm Jay Dyer, Jay's Analysis.
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:42.000]  We're watching the Alex Junction.
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  There's only five days left in the Info Wars total blowout mega sale.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  Five days left.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  I want to thank you all for your support because things are so unstable and so crazy and the supply chains are breaking down.
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  I made the decision a month ago to sell out of our inventory and then to readjust and even see if we're going to be able to continue on in the future with this model of funding or operations by selling high quality supplements for their products.
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  And thanks to your support, we've gotten in enough money to reorder most of the best sellers.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  We still have a lot of our best selling items available, but they're selling out very, very quickly.
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  We still have 30 to 60% off free shipping and the big thing triple Patriot points.
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  That's 15% off on your next order.
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  If you sign up for auto shipping, additional 2% off.
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  So some of these deals are so good, we lose money on the products.
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  Regardless, it gets money into our coffers in the short term to continue the fight.
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:40.000]  Things are so critical right now with the election.
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  This is the site infostore.com.
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:11.000]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old fashioned stupidity.
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  No more pesky lawn order.
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:22.000]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[3:35:22.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  But wait, vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes and more taxes.
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  Democrats bringing chaos right to your front door.
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  It's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince Congress and the rest of the world that we were only the initial target to set the precedent for coordinated big tech censorship.
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  Now the world finally understands it, but we don't have two and a half years for the learning curve to take place this time.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:08.000]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying the lockdown is permanent.
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  It is a plan to lower carbon footprint.
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  It is a plan to make the world population poor.
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  It is a diabolical power grab.
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  It is a revolution against the industrial revolution.
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  They call it the post industrial world and it's the excuse for them to take control of every fast of our lives and implement absolute authoritarianism.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  So again, everybody out there, if you love your children, like my daughter that just woke up here, and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get awake, you need to understand this information, you need to warn others, okay?
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  It's a life and death situation.
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:50.000]  You've got it.
[3:36:50.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  All right, you're on call.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  You've got it.
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  All right, you're on call.
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  You've got it.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  All right, you're on call.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer for this final hour in this final segment.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:12.000]  We were getting into the niceties of Pope Francis's new encyclical, which has really rocked the entire Catholic world.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  It's making a lot of waves all over precisely because it's controversial.
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  And it's controversial not because of anything traditional or conservative, but rather the opposite, really taking the liberalization of that church to its next logical step.
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  And it's not just me that has come to this conclusion or given this analysis.
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  In fact, high level Vatican and Roman Catholic clerics have actually come out stating that this is a huge problem.
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  Remember, not too long ago, there was a famous letter by Vagano, right?
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  Archbishop Vagano wrote a powerful letter to President Trump about the struggle between good and evil that's playing out now.
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  He even mentioned secret societies, sort of intelligence networks that are intent on disrupting Western civilization, disrupting the church.
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  And in fact, Trump retweeted this.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  If I recall, he retweeted the articles about this letter and how we got a real conspiracy on our hands.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  Now, a couple of days ago, Vagano, again, made waves because, as you just saw there, he came out with this article talking about how the deep state is tied to the deep church to overthrow Trump.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  So here you have, again, high level archbishop saying the very things that you hear me saying.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  So you know it's not something made up, it's not wild.
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  Other people are coming to notice this because it's transparent.
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  It's all out in the open.
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  Yeah, here we go.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  He urges Trump to fight this deep state.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  And what is it that we're talking about?
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  We're talking about the very things that you're hearing me talk about.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  We're talking about these networks of the Democrats, the Rhino Republicans, the McCain's, the Bushes, the Clintons tied into the intelligence and banking apparatus.
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  The technocrats, right?
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  All working together.
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  And they pushed a similar agenda of globalism, one worldism, and one world religion.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  And we can see this in a just shocking way in this new encyclical.
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  It is amazing.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  It's mind blowing what Francis has put into this encyclical.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  Now, remember, this is not just some article that he wrote.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  Are he just giving his opinions?
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  No, no, no, this is official teaching of the Catholic Church.
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  Papal encyclicals do fall under what Catholics believe is an ordinary teaching office of the Church.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  So even though the encyclical might not be necessarily infallible in the Catholic view, it still has the normative authority of what they call ordinary teaching.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  And as Francis progresses in his argumentation, he says, I want to thank the Imam.
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:58.000]  I want to thank the other religions that I've met with.
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  He says that the Imam paved a way for me to write this encyclical on universal brotherhood.
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  And he says that, I think, something that kind of some people mistook to be a critique of the elite.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  No, no, no, this is not a critique of the elite.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  He says, political life in the modern world is increasingly fragile in the face of transnational economic powers that operate within the principle of divide and conquer.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  Now, if you just took that phrase, it might sound like something I would say or anybody here at Info Wars.
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  Yeah, there are powerful international economic powers that seek to divide and conquer.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  What interest does the Vatican have in banking?
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  Oh, wait.
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Yes, a gigantic international usury-based bank called the Vatican Bank, which is known for decades and decades of scandals.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  In fact, there are famous books by David Yalop and others about the Vatican banking scandals that involve the P2 Lodge, the Mafia, famous people being assassinated, and perhaps even John Paul I being assassinated in regard to Vatican Bank scandals.
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  Now, the Vatican Bank is a gigantic bank.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  It has had some of the biggest families in the world, such as the Rothschilds being the official bankers back to the 1700s for the Vatican.
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  So just like with the self-defense quip that he had about we don't need self-defense, it's time to move away from borders and violence.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  It's hard for me to take seriously the statement that Francis is worried about the international banking institutions.
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  He is the head of an international banking institution known as the Vatican Bank.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  So this is very hard to accept given that.
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  But as he moves on, and remember, what is communism, socialism, Marxism a great tool for?
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  For very wealthy banking people.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  There you see some interesting triangle symbology there that seems to harken to mind the FBI's list of symbols that might be worth looking into.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  Francis says that we have grown indifferent to being wasteful, to having too much excess, right, to not sharing your food.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Really.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  So in other words, he begins with this guilt trip of that if you have food, if you waste food, right, you're guilty.
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  If you have excess, if you're a nation that has profit, you should feel guilty because you have only had that profit at the expense of, say, a third world country.
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  Now that is a classic Marxist tactic, right, to put off again this guilt complex.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  Meanwhile, this is coming from a guy who literally lives in a palace, right.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:57.000]  The Vatican has for centuries had various villas and palaces, right, even for almost a century, right, in what's called the Avignon Papacy,
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  a giant palace in France where the Pope lived in a palace in France.
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  And yet he's here to tell us that we should feel bad because we have private property and because we have, you know, a job where we make a profit or something like that.
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:21.000]  Well, this is just ludicrous, right, because he says that if you disagree and if you believe in borders, why, that's racist.
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  Really, again, the Vatican is surrounded by a Leonine wall. I don't think that Francis is letting any migrants sleep in the floor, or in the catacombs of the Vatican.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:36.000]  They probably don't want to sleep in the catacombs of the Vatican. You might get sacrificed down there.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  So maybe it's better to keep the migrants away from the Vatican basement, but I don't think he's letting anyone into his papal villa, right, or his vacation villa to sleep the night over
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  because he's such a good-hearted guy. No, this is to make everybody in particularly America feel guilty.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  You see, consistently throughout the encyclical here, he talks about how if you have excess, if you have more, if you have money, if you have property,
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  if you believe in self-defense, you want to have guns, if you want to have borders, it's because you're racist, it's because you're evil, it's because probably you like Trump.
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  That's more or less what he intimates in this conceit.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  As I mentioned, Trump, but he talks about fake news and people inciting racism and mean politicians, right?
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  Well, I wonder who he means, right?
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  He says, the culture of temptation to build walls, to raise walls, to erect walls in the heart, walls on your land, right?
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  This prevents an encounter with other cultures.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:47.000]  You see, that's the only reason that you should have open borders is just to have this fun sort of kumbaya experience with all the other cultures, right?
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  It's that easy, it's that simple.
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  And the only people who disagree with this are racist.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  But now, wait a minute, Francis just had a meeting where he okayed the Chinese selection of Chinese-approved communist bishops.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:14.000]  Now, if you don't know, there's what's called a Chinese Catholic Church, which is a state-approved church where the Communist Party approves the bishops in China.
[3:45:14.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  And Pompeo actually wanted to have a meeting with Francis over this.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:28.000]  And Francis actually dissed Pompeo and went with China and okayed the communist bishops in China.
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:31.000]  This was another big revelation this last week, kind of shocked a lot of people.
[3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  Remember, we covered the Wim Hof book, we had decades and decades of the CIA working to sort of co-opt the Vatican and the Jesuits.
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:46.000]  And here they get shafted because Francis is actually way more down the globalist line than anybody else in terms of the establishment.
[3:45:46.000 --> 3:45:48.000]  He doesn't even want to meet with Pompeo.
[3:45:48.000 --> 3:45:53.000]  He goes and he says, oh, yes, nothing wrong with communist-approved Catholic bishops.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:46:01.000]  Now, again, is Francis not aware of China, other Asian countries? They have pretty strict border rules.
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  But I don't think he means that for China, does he?
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  No, no, no. You see, this is directed only at the West, particularly at the United States.
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  And that's why you can see very clearly that Francis is a subverter.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  He is a revolutionary.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  He is not really interested in Christianity or the teachings of Christ.
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  It's really to play this office and this role to help subvert the bastion of Western civilization that's left.
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  The remnants, the last remaining principles going back to common law, Roman law, Byzantine law, Magna Carta, these kinds of things.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  That needs to go away to transition into the technocratic era.
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:48.000]  And all of these guys, all these people are essentially servants for that technocracy.
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  Even if they pretend like they're criticizing it or critiquing it.
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:58.000]  So I would say, definitely go check out this article on Vigano and the deep state, how it's teamed up to over.
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:03.000]  And it's not so much that they care about the person of Trump, it's what Trump represents, right?
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  It's what America represents in its good aspects, right?
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  That's what they want to get rid of, right?
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:16.000]  Self-sufficiency, the ability to have a limitation on tyrants and government and corporations.
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:20.000]  All these things that traditional America holds to, non-interventionism.
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  You know, this kind of stuff is what has to go away for this technocracy to come into play.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:30.000]  And that's why they're all part of this great reset scam from J. Dara Gay's analysis.
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:46.000]  And this is the out...
