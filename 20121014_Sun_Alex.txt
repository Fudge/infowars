[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Sunday transmission. We are going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:46.000 --> 01:14.000]  The news websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and we are going to be joined as well coming up in the second hour by investigative journalist John Rappaport going over, well, the New York Times and hundreds of other newspapers out with the disgusting talking point
[01:14.000 --> 01:29.000]  that we need to just drug all children that drugs, Rital and Prozac, you name it, actually makes their brains work better. So it's not just for ADHD kids, it's for everybody.
[01:29.000 --> 01:44.000]  In fact, the New York Times has written five articles I've seen the last three days or so, drugs to improve learning, attention disorder or not pills to help in school, whether without attention deficit, this helps them learn, they all need it.
[01:44.000 --> 01:52.000]  That's the new freedom initiative. Instead of just saying half or mentally ill, look at this poor kid they've got on speed type drugs and they say, look how much it's helping him.
[01:52.000 --> 02:03.000]  And you look at the color photo of me looks like a zombie poor child. The pills boost focus and impulse control in children. Ah, and that they all need it now.
[02:03.000 --> 02:18.000]  Here's another one. Risky rise of the good grade pill. That's actually New York Times article critical of it, but they've got many, many others. It is a full court press coming out with the whole new freedom initiative.
[02:18.000 --> 02:35.000]  And so we're going to be breaking all of that down here today. In fact, guys, my clock fell off the wall. I'm noticing and I guess I've gotten obsessive compulsive about things that I'm so used to be able to look at with the clock and the date and all that.
[02:35.000 --> 02:48.000]  I must have, it was on the floor and I couldn't read it. So I put it up there and it's behind there. It's, it's behind here. I'll show you. I'll just come over there. It must be behind that television. You know, you can walk in front of it.
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  No, no, no, it's fine. I've got, I've got to have it. I've just absolutely got to have it. Do you walk in front of it? It's all right. Yeah, I must have fallen off the wall.
[02:56.000 --> 03:09.000]  And there it is hiding back there. So when we go to break, we're going to come back and we'll read that coming up in the second hour here. I love it so much. I can just thank you. I can just have it right there. There you go.
[03:09.000 --> 03:19.000]  Mine. Now I feel good. I tell you, it's weird. I'm smiling. Go speak to 10,000 people, not even get upset or have butterflies anymore. I can go on national TV. They totally calm.
[03:19.000 --> 03:33.000]  And I've never really been an obsessive compulsive type person, but so many thousands of times looking at the camera, talking into the microphone and having the clock on the wall. I absolutely could not continue on. It's like the lucky rabbit foot or something.
[03:33.000 --> 03:44.000]  I didn't realize that to look over there and it wasn't there. And I just knew it had fallen behind. You see there and it was, it was, I even knew it was resting over there behind that big giant television.
[03:44.000 --> 03:55.000]  We use as a computer monitor so I can see the calls and stuff that are coming in. So it is October 14th, 2012, and it is a 403 and 53 seconds.
[03:55.000 --> 04:03.000]  We will officially start the broadcast when we come back in the next segment now that I have my, my teddy.
[04:03.000 --> 04:16.000]  Lovey, I need my clock. First and howl the third. What do you expect me to do? A radio show without my, without my trusty clock? Who's got the, it's even got the weather on it.
[04:16.000 --> 04:26.000]  Did I hit the programming button? How else do we get reports from the mainland? Here on Gilligan's Island. First and howl the third.
[04:26.000 --> 04:36.000]  Okay, we're going to come right back after this quick break. I think the new thing I'm going to do is just have it right here with me while I broadcast this right next to me.
[04:36.000 --> 04:56.000]  All right, I'm going to get serious. Hey, race riots, are they coming? Thomas Sowell and many others say yes, and Twitter and Facebook are alive, flooded with threats that America will burn if Barry Citerro, aka Barack Obama, is unelected our savior.
[04:56.000 --> 05:07.000]  And it looks bad because Romney's pulled ahead. Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die? Start purifying your water with ProPure.
[05:07.000 --> 05:16.000]  My friends, I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there, Bar Nun, is ProPure and it's available discounted at infowars.com.
[05:16.000 --> 05:27.000]  Its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required. It's NSF 42 certified. Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  Easy to set up and use. Doesn't require electricity. Purify water from lake streams, ponds and wells. This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.
[05:36.000 --> 05:46.000]  Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic. ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses.
[05:46.000 --> 06:15.000]  ProPure.com already has the lowest price on ProPure, but if you add the promo code WATER at checkout, you get an additional 10% off and infowars.com. You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[06:15.000 --> 06:27.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[06:27.000 --> 06:38.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern, we're on the radio live, but that is enough for me.
[06:38.000 --> 06:57.000]  I come in Sunday with my trusty crew, and we come to you live 4-6 Central, 5-7 Eastern, 2-4 Pacific, 3-5 Mountain, and it is the 14th day of October 2012 on this live Sunday broadcast.
[06:57.000 --> 07:10.000]  And we're only, I don't know, 3 weeks or so away now in the true final stretch of election 2012, and the whole world is watching because both men are globalists.
[07:10.000 --> 07:18.000]  Both men have stated they're anti-gun. Both men have stated they like corporate welfare and promise people all sorts of free goodies.
[07:18.000 --> 07:27.000]  But at least Mitt Romney has to say, as a supposed Republican, that he's pro-free market and that small businesses are good, and that cutting taxes is good.
[07:27.000 --> 07:39.000]  Yeah, unless you want to reckon economy to consolidate it, everybody knows you raise taxes long-term, 100% of the time, if you raise taxes long-term too much, it will reduce tax revenue.
[07:39.000 --> 07:49.000]  So why do they raise taxes every year in California for the last 50 years straight? Because it's about only the big boys who write the laws being exempt from that.
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  Same thing in France. You don't think everybody's paying 80-something percent taxes, do you? No, no, no, no, no. Globalists have written the laws where they are exempt.
[07:58.000 --> 08:09.000]  Okay, that's what we're talking about here. That's what other mainline conservative talk show hosts won't tell you. Liberals say, get rid of all money, all private property, communism is wonderful.
[08:09.000 --> 08:20.000]  At their core, that's what they push, and that all corporations are bad. Right-wingers say, all corporations are good and wonderful, and no, that's not true either.
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  A lot of corporations are predatory and work with government. So we'll never change things when the terms are all scrambled.
[08:26.000 --> 08:38.000]  Well, this is going to be a very important broadcast today. Our top story I'm getting to in a moment has also been the top story the last day and a half at drudgereport.com,
[08:38.000 --> 08:47.000]  and it's now moved to the middle of drudgerport.com, the middle top story. I say that because it's already scrolled off the main page of infowars.com,
[08:47.000 --> 09:07.000]  and I had the Sunday webmaster, Don Salazar, repost it in the guest radio box, show guide area, is a link to the report from the Economic Collapse Blog and Michael Schneider that we syndicated infowars.com,
[09:07.000 --> 09:24.000]  and it covers will the election results cause massive riots to erupt all over America? And I did a little research to add to the article at the bottom in a video I shot yesterday,
[09:24.000 --> 09:40.000]  and I found, I don't know, professor, researcher, journalist, Thomas Sowell over creator syndicate writing, our race riots coming. We have a clip of him on the syndicate radio.
[09:40.000 --> 09:56.000]  We'll play it a little while, breaking all of that down, going over the fact that he believes if Obama loses that there will be racially motivated riots in this country.
[09:56.000 --> 10:11.000]  So we are going to be going over that here today. And guys, I know you printed me. Here it is. I just wanted to give credit to it. He was on KABC talk show covering that.
[10:11.000 --> 10:18.000]  That's the source of that that's coming up in the next segment. I'll play a few minutes of this. Thomas Sowell race riots will Obama loses the Western Journalism Center.
[10:18.000 --> 10:26.000]  I found that clip from three days ago and posted that because, you know, it's not just the article that we ran by Michael Schneider. That's excellent.
[10:26.000 --> 10:38.000]  Showing on Twitter and Facebook where people are saying, you know, we're going to go out and riot and burn stuff. Basically, if Obama doesn't win, I went out myself and searched it and found it all over.
[10:38.000 --> 10:52.000]  And when I shot a video about it yesterday with the headline threats of riots of Obama loses flood of the Internet, there were a bunch of commenters there.
[10:52.000 --> 11:02.000]  And you go to their channels, they're real people saying we're going to burn stuff. We're going to riot if Obama doesn't win.
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  You know, I'm not saying you should riot ever. But but what about rioting over the NDA? The government saying they'll secretly kill citizens whenever they want.
[11:09.000 --> 11:17.000]  Or the NSA publicly spying on us illegally and not getting in trouble. Or the government ordering the torture of children in front of their parents.
[11:17.000 --> 11:28.000]  That's in the Army's own report. Or why don't black folks riot over 52% of black babies, never being born since Roe v. Wade being aborted.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  I'm not saying you should riot, but I mean, I'm upset about it and I'm not black. I think it's pretty darn horrible.
[11:35.000 --> 11:45.000]  But let me tell you, this is a real issue because you've already got all sorts of racially motivated attacks increasing in this country because it's politically correct and cool to do black on white.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  That's all over local news here and there. Never really makes it to national news.
[11:49.000 --> 12:03.000]  But you've you've seen the cases that mainstream media can't can't block out increasing it at public events at, you know, at city events, at events in downtown areas all over the country.
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  Racially motivated mobs of people attacking mainly. Well, the white devils whenever they're out on the streets.
[12:09.000 --> 12:19.000]  And Thomas soul writes about that in his article at creators syndicate that syndicated, you know, going over examples of this.
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  And now even members of newspapers and TV have been attacked and the TV stations and newspapers say we cannot report. That's politically incorrect.
[12:26.000 --> 12:34.000]  So you've got that component. You've got the depression that this country's really been in in many sectors of the economy in many areas.
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.000]  The recession for some a depression for many others. John Williams of shadow stats and other economists, former head of the Treasury and policy.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts here has said it's a depression. All the economists we've had on they've got fake economic numbers.
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.000]  They put out that that's been exposed. You add the economic worldwide meltdown that's happening.
[12:55.000 --> 13:06.000]  You add the gangbanger culture that's got poor people in urban areas, predominantly black, killing each other at record numbers, even per square mile, more dangerous than Mexico.
[13:06.000 --> 13:19.000]  Most dangerous place in the world is now Chicago. The most dangerous country in the world is Mexico or capita more dangerous than Syria to the middle of a proxy war, stage civil war.
[13:19.000 --> 13:32.000]  We've got that coming up in this. So you've got all of these ingredients percolating around and the police in Detroit putting up signs saying enter Detroit at your own risk.
[13:32.000 --> 13:41.000]  We cannot maintain law and order. Things are imploding. But you still got federal grants for your anti gun program to go after law abiding citizens with guns.
[13:41.000 --> 13:57.000]  Just like Chicago has a gun ban. And then you got the gangster in chief there around the manual of Chicago land gangsterville running around saying, oh, we want the public to go online to the city website.
[13:57.000 --> 14:03.000]  He said two weeks ago and tell us why you think things are so violent.
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.000]  Well, you've you've you've hung out signs saying criminals nationwide come to a big city get free welfare, beat up whoever you want on the subways.
[14:12.000 --> 14:22.000]  All the famous videos that they post on the gangster type sites beating up old people, walking up to old men and sucker punching them and knocking them out.
[14:22.000 --> 14:34.000]  You get extra, you know, media attention of the person that was to be white. But they also beat up black people, Hispanics and predominantly it's the young black males doing it.
[14:34.000 --> 14:44.000]  You've got this culture being force fed and pushed by the media by MTV by all of it. And now it's spilling out into all racial groups.
[14:44.000 --> 14:59.000]  And it's despicable what's happened and it's disgusting and it's bad for every every community in this country. And now we've got open calls and this is linked in the article at info wars dot com.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  Will the election results cause massive riots to erupt all over all over America.
[15:05.000 --> 15:16.000]  And again, that's Michael Schoner the economic collapse blog.com I think is the address of that but I'll give that to you after the break if you want to go to the site itself also have it linked there.
[15:16.000 --> 15:29.000]  Yes blog.com the economic class blog.com we have it up at info wars.com with a bunch of examples linking to Twitter where it's being saying if Romney wins I'm starting a riot who's with me stuff like that with the links.
[15:29.000 --> 15:43.000]  And I've got Watson doing a big article the bunch of other examples. Then we've got Thomas soul saying the same thing. And then we've got the Chicago now dot com riots to follow the election and examiner.
[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  Newspaper Twitter explodes with threats of riots with all the links to it.
[15:48.000 --> 16:00.000]  That is just some of the reports we're going to be going over and it looks like it may happen because Mitt Romney and a whole bunch of major polls has now pulled ahead of Obama clearly.
[16:00.000 --> 16:20.000]  Cold and flu season is upon us. Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning as well as help improve wound healing.

[16:33.000 --> 16:46.000]  This new technology is much more effective than colloidal or ionic silvers and has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness of older solutions.

[18:11.000 --> 18:19.000]  Vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices.
[18:19.000 --> 18:29.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases.
[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  Eat foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I recently increased my supply from food direct because we've all known this was coming.

[18:59.000 --> 19:12.000]  Aaron Fullen here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir.
[19:12.000 --> 19:19.000]  It seems there's a war on life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[19:19.000 --> 19:27.000]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[19:27.000 --> 19:35.000]  And today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.000]  But here's some good news. Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[19:42.000 --> 19:50.000]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself. For more information check out fermentationfactor.com. That's fermentationfactor.com.
[19:50.000 --> 20:00.000]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com. That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[20:20.000 --> 20:27.000]  Our back and thank you so much for joining us. Journalist John Rappaport will be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[20:27.000 --> 20:36.000]  We'll open the phones up then as well to break down in the last week hundreds of articles including five different ones I saw in the New York Times this week.
[20:36.000 --> 20:44.000]  Saying drug all kids in school with Ritalin, Prozac and other speed and psychotropic type drugs.
[20:44.000 --> 20:53.000]  And of course Big Pharma wrote this. They were just going to say half the kids are now mentally ill but people said well half of them aren't mentally ill because they got 20% on drugs right now.
[20:53.000 --> 21:01.000]  We'll just say you all need to be on drugs and statins and of course sudden infant death syndrome. I've got studies here. They've done this for 20 years more.
[21:01.000 --> 21:09.000]  It is mainly caused by vaccines. They do autopsies and find it out and the federal government quietly pays people off.
[21:09.000 --> 21:20.000]  But they've got some news on that. Now they shoot the babies up and then they die and their heart rate goes up, their breathing goes up and well they die but vaccines are good because Big Pharma says so.
[21:20.000 --> 21:32.000]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down as well in the serious situation in Syria where they're now doing a no fly zone over parts of it and over Turkey.
[21:32.000 --> 21:48.000]  They're grabbing and enforcing down Russian aircraft, passenger liners. U.S. troops are fighting under NATO against Russian troops in Syria and our troops are fighting alongside al-Qaeda that is the main jihadi force that our government's brought into the area.
[21:48.000 --> 21:58.000]  It is off the charts immoral. And it's in the newspaper. Al-Qaeda is helping. Just totally immoral off the charts evil.
[21:58.000 --> 22:07.000]  We're going to be looking at all of that. I want to play a clip here from K.A.B.C. with Larry Elder interviews.
[22:07.000 --> 22:22.000]  Thomas Sowell, again journalist, professor, you name it, who predicts that if Obama loses, just because people are dependent on welfare, they're going to perceive the fact that they are being cut off the gravy train.
[22:22.000 --> 22:30.000]  Folks, you know that I don't demonize the welfare people. I think they're pitiful. They've deindustrialized this country. They've tried to force people onto food stamps.
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.000]  The food stamp program has doubled from 20-something million to almost 50 million. It's like 49 million in change since Obama got in.
[22:40.000 --> 22:49.000]  He has the nerve to say that you didn't build your own small business. I mean, it's like having Fidel Castro as president.
[22:49.000 --> 22:58.000]  It's just incredible. The things we hear coming out of a U.S. president's mouth, I'm not predicting there will be racially motivated riots in this country.
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.000]  But I certainly hope there isn't. And I think we do have the atmosphere there where this could happen.
[23:04.000 --> 23:15.000]  I know of the police, like we saw in the LA riots a few decades ago, if they stand down, if there's any looting or a car gets dumped over or something, then it will spread.
[23:15.000 --> 23:21.000]  If the police pull back, like they do, politically correct reasons.
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  And of course, that may happen because the power structure wants to use this as a pretext to take liberties the American people.
[23:27.000 --> 23:35.000]  But watching inner-city folks burn down their own neighborhoods as a form of protest is very, very sad.
[23:35.000 --> 23:39.000]  A lot of people laugh at it. I don't think it's funny because I want everyone to be empowered.
[23:39.000 --> 23:47.000]  I want to get our country back and its dependency, you know, when the inner-city areas get burned out.
[23:47.000 --> 23:53.000]  The big government types love that because now there's no businesses and all those people have is welfare.
[23:53.000 --> 24:03.000]  And I've watched MSNBC sometimes and all it is is race baiting and race card and you're a racist if you don't like government health care and you're a racist if you don't vote for Obama.
[24:03.000 --> 24:13.000]  And it is so despicable that in the name of fighting racism that I think is just, you know, racism is just mindless and stupid and is used to control us.
[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  It's divide and conquer. I'm totally against racism, tribalism, all this garbage.
[24:18.000 --> 24:27.000]  But when people are politically correct and think they can be racist against you because, well, you're the bad guy, you're the white guy, it forces you into the debate.
[24:27.000 --> 24:42.000]  And that's what the globalists want. But if you look at the poverty pimp types, all of them, Slimeball, Chris Matthews, Mr. Maddow, I mean, Miss Maddow, Rachel Maddow.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  You look at those people, all they're doing is injecting racial division all day long and making everything racial.
[24:48.000 --> 24:58.000]  And so people then watch that and believe that, well, you know, I've got a get out of jail free card. I should go out and riot.
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.000]  I should go out and engage in these things. And look at who used to call for riots in New York City and who used to stir stuff up.
[25:04.000 --> 25:11.000]  Al Sharpton, well, he's now one of the biggest hosts on MSNBC and it doesn't empower anybody.
[25:11.000 --> 25:24.000]  In fact, all it does is create more division and make groups of people be afraid of each other. And that's exactly what big government wants to keep everybody in their ghettos, in their barrios, in their neighborhoods.
[25:24.000 --> 25:31.000]  The white people running to the suburbs, you know, gentrification hiding out there.
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  This is exactly what we see getting pushed. And folks, if you look at Twitter and Facebook and all over, we've got big reports coming out on this.
[25:39.000 --> 25:50.000]  We've already got some up at infowars.com. But we've got a big one coming out tomorrow morning, maybe even tonight by Paul Watson, because there's a lot of examples of this and a lot of people calling for it.
[25:50.000 --> 26:01.000]  And I think that unfortunately, researcher and journalist Thomas Sowell may be right about this happening, especially if it gets encouraged.
[26:01.000 --> 26:11.000]  And remember, and here's the key, I cover this in my film, The Obama Deception, made three and a half years ago.
[26:11.000 --> 26:23.000]  If Obama, when he was U.S. Senator, would tell his cousin over in Kenya, Odinga, when he lost the election against the Christian majority, Odinga is a Muslim, he said,
[26:23.000 --> 26:34.000]  have your Muslim constituents, the letters public, riot and demand you be given his feet in government. And he did, and they made the prime ministership for Odinga.
[26:34.000 --> 26:46.000]  So don't think when Obama, and then this came out in the news, sent Justice Department people down with the Trayvon Martin tragedy to try to stir up the people and get some type of race war going.
[26:46.000 --> 26:58.000]  And they had some attacks going on and stores being looted. Remember that? Don't think they won't pull something like that now and play blacks and whites and others off against each other.
[26:58.000 --> 27:09.000]  That's pointless. Rioting will only, in fact, I saw some of the emails I got, I saw some of the comments on the YouTube video, they said, yeah, you better be afraid, you know, Jones,
[27:09.000 --> 27:19.000]  you know, you're racist, you know, you're a white racist, all sorts of stuff. Listen, I live 25 miles outside Austin, Texas. It sounds like World War Three every weekend with my neighbors.
[27:19.000 --> 27:29.000]  I mean, next door to me, they're filming some Discovery Channel gun show every week. It sounds like World War Three going on. Famous guy lives in, you know, nearby who's got a show.
[27:29.000 --> 27:44.000]  The point is, I'm not afraid if people burn, you know, East Austin, or I don't think that would happen here, but Chicago, Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, places like that.
[27:44.000 --> 27:59.000]  It's so mindless that when I'm saying in this, in this video report that I've got up at infowars.com and prisonpunna.com, I'm in there saying let's not, whoever gets elected, let's not have riots, let's not have violence.
[27:59.000 --> 28:08.000]  Both guys are puppets of the globalist. You know, this is stupid. We should come together for national sovereignty, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[28:08.000 --> 28:17.000]  People are calling for this, a lot of opportunistic criminals that just want to rob shops. Don't be part of this if Romney wins and go out and riot.
[28:17.000 --> 28:25.000]  And they're like, oh, you're just afraid. It's so stupid. What, afraid you'll burn down your neighborhood in LA again? And everybody laughs at you?
[28:25.000 --> 28:35.000]  I mean, you know, because a bunch of criminals run around, give everybody in the neighborhood a bad name. It's just so stupid that this type of stuff is going on.
[28:35.000 --> 28:46.000]  And again, I'm very, very concerned. Are you concerned? I'm going to give the number out. I want to get your take on this. 877789 Alex on this issue, 877789 Alex.

[33:22.000 --> 33:35.000]  Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:35.000 --> 33:50.000]  Hey, my friends. Again, it is Sunday. We're very glad that you are here joining us on this 14th day of October 2012. And if Barack Obama, as U.S. Senator, told his cousin, Odinga, in letterhead, it's public.
[33:50.000 --> 34:00.000]  It's in my film, The Obama Deception. Just look it up. Just look up, Obama told his cousin, Odinga, you know, to stage unrest in Kenya so that he'd be given a spot in the government.
[34:00.000 --> 34:10.000]  That letter is public on this senatorial letterhead. If he would do that, I don't know, that was about seven, eight years ago. What would he do now?
[34:10.000 --> 34:18.000]  I mean, they're not going to give up power easily. They shipped tens of thousands of guns and hand grenades into Mexico.
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.000]  This all came out, CBS News, to blame the Second Amendment. And the memo came out that they were going to blame the Second Amendment.
[34:24.000 --> 34:34.000]  And guess what they did? They still say we should restrict guns and not let you have semi-autos because of what happened in Mexico.
[34:34.000 --> 34:46.000]  They never give up. They never stop. They never back off. And the problem is the Republicans are bought and paid for by the same power structure, so they act like they're against all this, but they go along with all of it.
[34:46.000 --> 34:58.000]  And wait until I get to the economic news that we've got here. But again, if you just joined us, here are some of the headlines.
[34:58.000 --> 35:13.000]  Will the election results cause massive riots to erupt all over America? And the story at infowars.com links to a bunch of different people on their own sites and their own Twitter and Facebook accounts saying yes.
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.000]  And here is the Chicago Now newspaper reporting riots to follow the election.
[35:19.000 --> 35:37.000]  Here's an examiner story by Bill Clark. Twitter explodes with threats of riots, and then it gives a bunch of quotes here from their Twitter, from their Facebooks, from their different sites, saying someone should shoot
[35:37.000 --> 35:46.000]  the Republican presidential candidate. They say his name here. I'm not even going to read these quotes. Tweeted, bow tie. And it just goes on.
[35:46.000 --> 35:54.000]  And you've heard about the school teachers telling kids, your parents should have had an abortion because you're a Republican and people getting beat up.
[35:54.000 --> 36:02.000]  I mean, it's all over the place. The absolute viciousness. If people don't want to support Obama and they say, well, you must be racist.
[36:02.000 --> 36:12.000]  And again, it's truly, truly disgusting to see this happening. And if there are any riots or attacks, give Mitt Romney wins.
[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  It is only going to hurt race relations in this country. It is only going to be used to bring in more of a police state in this nation.
[36:20.000 --> 36:35.000]  And I'm telling you, if the police stand down like they've done in Detroit and New York, remember the famous cases where they were letting men rape women in Central Park?
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  The New York police is shameful. Remember the LA riots? Remember all the other riots we've seen in Detroit, you name it?
[36:42.000 --> 36:55.000]  Where the police stand down and then just let people burn things down. And this has happened hundreds of times in the last 50, 60 years in this country.
[36:55.000 --> 37:06.000]  Different events. I mean, you have riots when sports teams win and the police go ride out or lose and rubber bullet everybody and attack everybody.
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  And sometimes use too much force and kill innocent people. We saw that when the Red Sox won a few years ago.
[37:12.000 --> 37:22.000]  But then if it's an election riot, they'll just stand down, at least in the past they have. And if that happens, folks, then people will say, well, it's my green light.
[37:22.000 --> 37:32.000]  Black, white, Hispanic, you name it, to go out in these poor areas and rob the local Walmarts, rob the targets, rob the pawn shops, rob the homes.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  And then it's always minorities that are getting burned up in their houses.
[37:38.000 --> 37:49.000]  And then they shoot it to fire department when they come. I mean, it is just crazy watching this historically and knowing that we've never in modern times been sitting on a bigger powder keg.
[37:49.000 --> 37:57.000]  And here's the news. Rasmussen polls, it's a bunch of other polls showing the same thing. Daily presidential tracking poll.
[37:57.000 --> 38:09.000]  The Rasmussen reports a daily presidential tracking poll for Sunday shows Mitt Romney attracting support from 49% of voters nationwide while President Obama earns a vote of 47.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  2% prefer some other candidate. Yeah, libertarian Gary Johnson and another 2% are undecided and they have the whole track there.
[38:17.000 --> 38:28.000]  But there's a whole bunch of polls, not just Rasmussen, but Mason, Dixon, Gallup. They've got them. They've got Romney coming up and being a dead heat or pulling ahead of Obama.
[38:28.000 --> 38:41.000]  As election day nears, Romney crowds are surging AP, Sydney, Ohio. Yeah, and Obama can't get 5,000 people in an event when you say you get 50,000, they have to bust people in to do that.
[38:41.000 --> 38:52.000]  So again, I'm thinking Obama's going to lose right now unless he launches a bigger war against Iran or Syria as an October surprise as ABC News said two weeks ago.
[38:52.000 --> 39:04.000]  By the way, a week before that, or days before that, our new magazine, the October issue came out, InfoWars Magazine, and our headline is October Surprise War.
[39:04.000 --> 39:21.000]  And we say, could Obama, it's actually the publisher's letter with yours truly, I break it down and I say Obama may stage a war to get elected.
[39:21.000 --> 39:33.000]  And again, I'm nonpartisan. I just report the facts. I absolutely am disgusted with Obama. Everybody knows that, but I come at this not from a left-right perspective, but a right-wrong perspective.
[39:33.000 --> 39:43.000]  Look at this article. Shut up and play nice. How the Western world is limiting free speech. This is the Washington Post. Sounds like Alex Jones wrote this.
[39:43.000 --> 39:51.000]  This came out today by Jonathan Turley, the constitutional lawyer, who I want to get back on the show by the way, guys. Please note that he's a great interview.
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.000]  The point is he goes through a laundry list of this. We're losing freedom no matter who's in office.
[39:56.000 --> 40:04.000]  And the last thing we need in this depressionary economy is major cities having riots.
[40:04.000 --> 40:16.000]  Now, I've made my points. Let's go ahead and go to a clip of Thomas Sowell on K-A-B-C radio a few days ago talking about racially motivated riots. Here it is.
[40:16.000 --> 40:32.000]  Let me just understand what you're saying, Tom. You're telling me that you believe if Obama gets defeated, there's going to be race riots in the country, not because he was defeated, but because of the unraveling of the welfare state and the dependency of the welfare state of so many people who have a vested interest in keeping things the way they are?
[40:32.000 --> 40:51.000]  Well, no, it's not quite that rational. I think that there are a lot of people out there who have every incentive to polarize the races, and they're being supported in innumerable government programs, from the Al Sharpton's and Jesse Jackson right on down to the local street corner rabble router.
[40:51.000 --> 41:01.000]  And I cannot believe that they will sit there quietly and see this man defeated if he is defeated, and not say that it was a fraud.
[41:01.000 --> 41:10.000]  So you're saying that people are going to say that Obama, the election was stolen from Obama the way Kerry is still saying that he lost the election because it was stolen from him in Ohio?
[41:10.000 --> 41:11.000]  Yes.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  Wow. And that it will lead to race riots.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  Yeah, it will, I think.
[41:18.000 --> 41:24.000]  What if Obama gets defeated, Tom, but Republicans don't get control of the Senate?
[41:24.000 --> 41:35.000]  Oh, my God. It'll be it'll be it'll be just a total turmoil because so much of what Obama did has to be undone.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.000]  All right, folks. Well, there you go.
[41:40.000 --> 41:46.000]  You know, I certainly hope that that is not the case.
[41:46.000 --> 41:55.000]  I certainly hope that this doesn't happen, but this could be the October surprise as well or November surprise.
[41:55.000 --> 42:05.000]  I mean, what if there are riots, even if Romney gets elected, Obama is still in office for the rest of November, December, and then to January 21.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  So that's two and a half months.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  Roughly, you're right at two and a half months.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  Or a little over two months to be technical.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  Who knows what they can do.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  Oh, I forgot the biggest point to all of this.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  We'll cover it more when we come back.
[42:23.000 --> 42:34.000]  All the articles we publish for the Army manuals and the Army admissions and the Army Times saying they're getting ready for massive civil unrest and rioting in November, but never saying why.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Oh, I forgot the biggest point of this.
[42:36.000 --> 42:43.000]  The government reason I'm so concerned and think this may happen that it may be triggered, there may be provocateurs in there or something would do this.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  So these communities go up in flames.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  There's massive preparations for it at a level I've never seen.
[42:50.000 --> 42:54.000]  So we'll break more of that down straight ahead and take your calls.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.000]  Get your take on it. Stay with us.
[43:00.000 --> 43:06.000]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[43:06.000 --> 43:09.000]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[43:20.000 --> 43:27.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[43:37.000 --> 43:40.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[43:40.000 --> 43:47.000]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[43:47.000 --> 43:53.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[46:20.000 --> 46:24.000]  Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  while powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases
[46:28.000 --> 46:33.000]  like strep throat, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other harmful pathogens.

[47:26.000 --> 47:48.000]  Okay, so we're talking about election 2012.
[47:48.000 --> 47:49.000]  I'm Alex Schoen, your host.
[47:49.000 --> 47:52.000]  Thanks for tuning in on this Sunday.
[47:52.000 --> 47:58.000]  And we're looking at Barack Obama sliding behind
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  or at a dead heat with Mitt Romney.
[48:00.000 --> 48:01.000]  Mitt Romney is pulling ahead.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  This is a horse race.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  Mitt Romney is starting to pull ahead.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  There's still three weeks to go before the election in early November.
[48:10.000 --> 48:13.000]  As you know, I don't like either candidate.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  They're both globalist.
[48:16.000 --> 48:21.000]  They're both dedicated to crony capitalism, the opposite of free market.
[48:21.000 --> 48:26.000]  Big mega banks sucking trillions of dollars a year of taxpayer money.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  Big pharma lobbying government to mandate all these vaccines.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  I mean, it's the law, but they lie on the news and say it's the law
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  to take a big raft of deadly shots.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  You've got all the regulations written to shut down the globalist competition
[48:42.000 --> 48:53.000]  and with the Obama noids and all the sheep like followers that they are going to
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  call foul if Obama loses.
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.000]  And I think you will see some civil unrest.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  I don't know how bad it will get.
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.000]  I hope it's not going to be riots, but a lot of experts think it is.
[49:05.000 --> 49:09.000]  And if you just joined us, Paul Watts has got an article coming out tomorrow
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  on this recapping it, but there's been a plethora of army times,
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  defense department press releases, training manuals for civil unrest,
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  mass arrest.
[49:22.000 --> 49:27.000]  Obamas had the army trained for reeducation.
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  Yeah, here's one army manual out on its plan to kill rioters,
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  demonstrators in America, warning shots will not be fired.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  And then we've got links to the army PDF.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  And then they were just showing another one that just came out with the
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  reeducation camps.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  U.S. Army purchases riot gear as fears over civil unrest grows.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  That's from back in July.
[49:46.000 --> 49:47.000]  And then it's got DHS.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  You've got the 1.6 billion bullets.
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.000]  It was 1 billion, 1.2 billion, 1.4 billion.
[49:53.000 --> 50:00.000]  Since last November in one year, they bought 1.4 billion this year,
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  200 million late last year.
[50:03.000 --> 50:09.000]  It's 1.6 billion, including sniper 308.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  And that's been big national news.
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  What's going on here?
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  And you notice you've got the economic meltdown.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  You've got all the proxy wars in Syria and Iran and Libya and just it's
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  all getting crazy.
[50:21.000 --> 50:26.000]  And the dollar dropping against the Chinese Yon and all of this
[50:26.000 --> 50:32.000]  incredible economic news I'll get to in the second hour that's happening.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  And you've got the cyber security act that openly restricts Internet
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  freedom.
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  All of this is happening.
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  These are those times in history when so much happens.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Let's go to Sean in New Hampshire.
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  Sean, what's your take on this?
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  Is it much to do about nothing?
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.000]  I mean, if people, there was a few little riots and fights and things in
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  Florida over the Trayvon Martin situation with the media hyping it,
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  what will happen if Obama doesn't get elected?
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Hey, let's hang up on.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  Now we're done.
[51:04.000 --> 51:05.000]  Sean, thank you.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Sorry.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  I just don't know you're there.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  Dennis in Texas.
[51:08.000 --> 51:09.000]  You're on the air.
[51:09.000 --> 51:10.000]  Go ahead.
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  Hey, Alex.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  Thank you for all you do.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  And we're glad you're there.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  You're the voice and the wilderness.
[51:16.000 --> 51:17.000]  What's going to happen?
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  These people want riots.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  They're provoking us at every turn.
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.000]  They want riots.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  They know how to deal with riots.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  Okay.
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  They can beat your head and they can.
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  That's what this whole thing's designed to do, provoke riots.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  Oh, and what's going to happen?
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  Oh, if the people go out there and riot because, oh, their entitlements,
[51:39.000 --> 51:44.000]  the stuff that they're stealing from me is going to be taken away from them.
[51:44.000 --> 51:47.000]  I'm not going to give it to them anymore, you know,
[51:47.000 --> 51:50.000]  because there's going to be some reform in the entitlement system.
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  Well, hey, I'm sorry.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  Now they're going to riot and then they're going to play right into their
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  skins and they'll declare martial law.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.000]  Absolutely.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  They will declare a civil emergency.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  Great point.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  I agree with you that it's definitely a danger.
[52:05.000 --> 52:11.000]  But by talking about it, we can force these big city police departments
[52:11.000 --> 52:14.000]  to stop rioting when it begins.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  But you've got to stop it right when it starts or it will spread like wildfire.
[52:19.000 --> 52:25.000]  Go right to the police department and confront them as human beings to human beings.
[52:25.000 --> 52:26.000]  All right.
[52:26.000 --> 52:27.000]  Thank you for the call there.
[52:27.000 --> 52:31.000]  Let's go to JT Coyote in Colorado.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  You're on the air.
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  Go ahead.
[52:33.000 --> 52:38.000]  You hit it right on the head with the November surprise idea.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  It will be provocative.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  You can guarantee.
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  You can you can rest.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  Normally, I'd say there was some danger.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  But why is government gearing up like it's the end of the world?
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  1.6 million bullets, massive preparations.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  What's going on exactly?
[52:53.000 --> 52:56.000]  And that this is what they're gearing up for.
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  I mean, this is like Nazi Germany.
[52:58.000 --> 53:07.000]  You know, if the chancellor isn't reelected, you know, the Mac Daddy that's going to pay
[53:07.000 --> 53:13.000]  the bills and buy me a car and a new house, you know, you've got a situation where the
[53:13.000 --> 53:20.000]  October surprise has been pushed back to November and that will stop the whole electoral process.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  Oh, yeah.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  What if it's a contested election again like 2000?
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  You can guarantee chevalon rest if that happens.
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  If they have some three week long circus again, Katie bar the door.
[53:33.000 --> 53:34.000]  Great points.
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  Good to hear from you.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  Let's talk to Frank in Texas.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  Frank, you're on the air.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  Go ahead.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  Yeah, I have a little bit different take on this.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  I think Obama, I think you give him too much credit for being a real person.
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  I think he's somewhat more of a monarch or, you know, a page baby.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  I don't think he's an actual real person.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.000]  So why would the people in charge get him out of office if they have a complete puppet
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  and they control the election because they want to give you a new puppet and they want
[54:01.000 --> 54:06.000]  to there's also fights within the power structure over the levers of who gets to be the executive
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  because, yeah, Obama's a puppet.
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  Romney would be a puppet as well.
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.000]  But that office has a lot of power for the puppeteer.
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.000]  So there's a real battle within the power structure always over who gets the presidency.
[54:20.000 --> 54:27.000]  Sir, all I'm saying is that that that the banksters want dependency.
[54:27.000 --> 54:31.000]  So they always go into countries and create socialism at the grassroots to get a dependent
[54:31.000 --> 54:36.000]  group so that the bankers have a dependent population who will always be for big government
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  ensuring the bankers get all their corporate welfare and corporate contracts and bailouts.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  So it's pressure from above and below squeezing the middle class.
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  That's how they really team up.
[54:47.000 --> 54:53.000]  And all I know is the welfare types out there, black, white, doesn't matter.
[54:53.000 --> 54:59.000]  They associate Obama, you know, with their own personal power and their well-being.
[54:59.000 --> 55:05.000]  And I'm seeing, again, the whole point of just joined us all over Twitter, all over Facebook.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  They've got Chicago newspaper reporting on it.
[55:07.000 --> 55:12.000]  They've got the examiner in FullWars.com's got a report on it with all the links where
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  it's just flooding the web and may just be Internet talk.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  It may be tough talk that, hey, I'm going to riot.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  I'm going to burn stuff.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  I'm going to kill people.
[55:21.000 --> 55:27.000]  You know, if Romney wins and people saying Romney should be killed, I'll guarantee you
[55:27.000 --> 55:32.000]  that if I got on there and said this person ought to be killed or that person ought to be killed,
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  there'd be cops here within an hour.
[55:35.000 --> 55:40.000]  But whenever, for whatever reason, liberal socialists, whatever, they can shoot their
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  mouth off about violence all day long, and that's supposedly okay.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  So that's the issue here.
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  And then you have the government massive preparation for civil unrest.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  What do you think the 1.6 billion bullets are for?
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  Well, they're probably to kill us.
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  But what I don't understand is if the, you know, elites, rock child and all of them,
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  if they have somebody who is a complete and total puppet from top to bottom, I mean,
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  CIA parents, I mean, you know, I haven't the whole thing.
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  Why would they get rid of them?
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  If they have their ideal person in office, why would they get rid of them?
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  I hear you.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  But I don't know if you heard my point.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[56:19.000 --> 56:22.000]  They need new puppets because old puppets wear out.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  Obama was in the news.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  They said he was the second coming of Christ.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  He was Christlike.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  He was mythical.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  He had halos on his head.
[56:29.000 --> 56:32.000]  In Time Magazine, remember all that?
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  Just three and a half, four short years ago.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  And then he didn't deliver heaven on earth.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  He's there to take the blame, take the heat.
[56:39.000 --> 56:45.000]  And when he's not good anymore, when he loses his value, they'll put a new one in like Mitt Romney.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  Let me tell you, Mitt Romney gets in there.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  It's going to be business as usual.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  Mitt Romney supported carbon taxes.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  Mitt Romney supports the UN.
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.000]  Mitt Romney supports anti-gun, anti-Semi-auto, open borders.
[56:58.000 --> 57:01.000]  He did right Obamacare.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  I mean, that's what happened.
[57:04.000 --> 57:09.000]  I mean, I saw their debate where they sat there and argued about who was giving people more goodies.
[57:09.000 --> 57:16.000]  So don't think that everything's going to be all right just because you elect Mitt Romney.
[57:16.000 --> 57:23.000]  Yes, obviously in action, Obama's worse because that's the Democratic Party supports communism.
[57:23.000 --> 57:29.000]  And anti-gun and anti-family and welfare and forced inoculations and getting God out of everything.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  I mean, Democrats by and large are really sick twisted weirdos.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  They've got a lot of, you know, moron supporters out there who aren't bad people, zombies.
[57:38.000 --> 57:41.000]  But a bunch of them are sick people.
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Obama!
[57:43.000 --> 57:54.000]  Second hour, more calls and John Rappaport coming up.
[58:13.000 --> 58:18.000]  We're going to be talking about the price of raw ingredients.
[58:18.000 --> 58:20.000]  The price of raw ingredients increases.
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  Eat foods will have to raise prices too.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[58:24.000 --> 58:28.000]  I recently increased my supply for MeFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.

[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the Information War continues.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  We're continuing with your calls and we have investigative journalist John Rappaport coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  We'll continue with calls after that.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  We're talking about all these preparations for economic collapse.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  We're talking about massive chatter and buzz on the Internet that we link to and document at infowars.com.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  With a talk of racially motivated riots of Obama doesn't win, this is now pure identity politics we're talking about.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  Terry in Illinois, what's your take on this?
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Thanks so much for taking my call.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  You listen first-time caller.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  I'm right in the suburbs of Chicago, so this is very important to me, the subject in and of itself.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  I wanted to thank you because I think you've connected all the dots for me.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  And I don't have the same opinion as your former callers.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  I think we're dealing with a malignant narcissist.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Yeah, your phone's not too good, ma'am.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  You say you think we're dealing with a narcissist. You talking about Obama?
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  Yes. I'll take it off, speaker.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  Yeah, I think he is a malignant narcissist and I think he's got everybody fooled.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  No, I hear you. I appreciate your call.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  Listen, we don't really screen calls, but guys, if you can't hear their voice clearly, we can't have them on air.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  I'm sorry, ma'am. I just couldn't really make out much of what you were saying.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  Jason, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Hey, Alex. God bless you. This is Jason from Scranton that got taken away by the Obama Nazi SS. How are you doing today?
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  You called. What was it, about a year ago or something?
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  What was your story?
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  It was a few months ago.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  What happened?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  In August.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  I was a guy that started the radio show and the day I started it, basically, one of my friends heard what I was saying about Obama.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  Oh, that's right. They came and had the psychologist take you away with the police.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  And then there were a bunch of other reports confirmed where if you're a radio host and talk about Obama, that's a mental illness.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  And they come and take you to jail and take your guns.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  No judge, no jury.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  He happened to Brandon Robb, the Marine and others and that's since been confirmed. We've played the newscast where they said you're not allowed to talk bad about him.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  You've heard the school teacher who didn't get in trouble. She told her students, you don't talk bad about the president or you will be arrested.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  My son, who's part of extracurricular activities, has been told by multiple children when they learn that he's my son that he should be arrested.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  And they go to the head sports people or folks at other events and call for his arrest.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  And then they have to announce, no, no, no, you're allowed to not be for Obama and he's not for Romney either.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  And they say, you need to be arrested. I mean, these are, these are sick people.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000]  Yeah, well, they know Alex that he's going to refuse to worship their, their Messiah.
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  And it's just incredible. You know, I can't, I really am getting sick of it.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:35.000]  We know why this, Alex, we're Christians. We understand the root of all racism.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  So this race riot stuff, if it happens, we know the root of it. It's Satan.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  I mean, anybody that has the spirit of God in them understands that all of this stuff is just division and it's making us hate our fellow man.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  What did Jesus say? Hey, due to the least done did to me, due to the least to me.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Well, that's right. But again, and when we respond to the incredible race division, provocateur rabble rousing of MSNBC, MPR and others, we're the bad guys.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  They live this stuff. This is the model they use for everybody's at each other's throats and the government is the referee over everyone.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  One suggestion to you.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Sure. Go ahead. We're about to go to break. Okay. Could you maybe do like one nightly news program of just like a prophecy show?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Could you think about it? Maybe, you know, I don't really wait into all that.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  I just know that I try to love God and try to be a good person.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  And I don't, I don't wait into just all of the, all the different interpretations of stuff that's out there.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  I just try to get people to stand up against evil right now.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  I've found all the prophecy stuff has become an excuse for so many people to not fight evil because I think it's the end of the world.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  We'll be right back to get into the forced drugging of our children. They say they want to drug all the kids now. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:06:10.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time and monster, monster, monster and monster.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen listening across the United States and worldwide, I am Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.800]  is the second hour of this Sunday radio broadcast.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.880]  I'm here every Sunday, four to six central time.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.840]  That's five to seven Eastern.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.440]  I am a documentary filmmaker.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.520]  If you're a new listener,
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.440]  I am also a syndicated radio host.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.440]  I've been on radio for 17 years, syndicated since 1998.
[01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:05.080]  So 14 years syndicated and never won above 100 stations.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.840]  It would go back and forth ping-ponging between 60
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:11.240]  and 100 stations, the stations sold
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:15.240]  and as stations change formats now, we're well over 120
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.600]  and rapidly growing, it'll be 160, 170 in a few months
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.000]  at the rate that we've got more than 50 stations
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.360]  in the process of signing on right now.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.840]  So I need to start reintroducing some of the basics
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.880]  occasionally, the New World Order, the private fellow reserve,
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.040]  the globalist, eugenics, we've got a lot of people
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.800]  that's what their in-games are.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.960]  If you just tuned in on one of our great new affiliates
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.760]  out there, I'm just somebody looking for freedom
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.800]  and I'm somebody looking for a level playing field
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.040]  and I don't like tyrants.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.320]  And I have stacks of news articles here today,
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.160]  we'll be going over some of them where they know
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.480]  and they've known for decades that sudden infant death
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.320]  syndrome is caused by vaccines.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.160]  And they pay out through a federal
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.280]  a multi-billion dollar slush fund to keep people quiet.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:11.360]  I know that the troops have seen at least five-fold increase
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.600]  in deformity in their children since the use
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.640]  of depleted uranium and there's more articles out on that
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.000]  mainstream news today.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.120]  I'm very upset that that's going on.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.760]  It's also come out that TEPCO admits it new problems
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.480]  at Fukushima before the earthquake hit it
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:33.400]  and covered up the real radiation levels
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.800]  just like they've done in nuclear disasters here in the US.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.360]  It's this culture we see out of the globalist
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.920]  time and time and time and time again
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.840]  of just drinking their own Kool-Aid,
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.520]  believing their own lies.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.320]  And as a society, more and more insane things
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.200]  are being done and being gotten away with
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.480]  by government and the big mega corporations
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.320]  that control it.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.080]  And I'm simply here trying to get people
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:02.280]  to become aware of what's happening.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.280]  Now, last hour, we got deep, deep into the 1.6 billion
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.400]  bullets bought in the last year by Homeland Security.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.680]  The Army admitting it preparing for civil unrest
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.200]  in late October, early November.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.520]  How that ties into the worldwide meltdown,
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.920]  accelerating the dollar, losing value,
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.560]  quantitative easing, turning up the printing presses
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.920]  but only giving the money to the ultra rich.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.160]  Talk about class warfare.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.760]  They've got people saying raised taxes on the rich
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.880]  means $125,000 a year or more.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.360]  That's not rich.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:39.360]  Meanwhile, meanwhile, on top of all of that,
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.680]  we've got tens of trillions given to offshore banks
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.000]  who are above the law and pay no taxes.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.160]  And I've got more news on that today in my economic stack.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.880]  We're gonna be getting to that as well.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:52.800]  In fact, here it is.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:55.720]  Social security increases for 2013
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.280]  could be lowest since 1975.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.000]  Oh, but don't worry, they take your money,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.760]  pay it into a big government fund
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.720]  and then pay it as corporate welfare out the back door.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.720]  This is AP, JPMorgan turns in record profit, higher revenue.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.320]  Well, yeah, they're given hundreds of billions of dollars
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.040]  a year of tax money.
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:18.400]  Of course, they're turning in higher revenue,
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.000]  a record profit, higher revenue.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.280]  So there's that.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.000]  Fed actions to reduce mortgage rates
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.520]  may be helping banks more than borrowers.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.160]  Washington Post, oh really, think so?
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.080]  This is a giant robbery happening
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.000]  and you've got people happy to be slaves
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.800]  if they get a free Obama phone
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.520]  or if they get a little welfare barely to live on.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.480]  It's dependency, it's disgusting, it's sad.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:47.000]  And now, Puppet Romney has pulled ahead
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.880]  in many polls of Puppet Obama
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.720]  and so we hear the calls all over the web for rioting.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.440]  And Thomas Sowell says he predicts it will happen
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:56.800]  if Obama loses.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.360]  I wanna get investigative journalist John Rappaport's
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:00.200]  take on that.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.480]  Then we'll get to why he's really here today with us
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.640]  and where your phone calls.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.480]  Man Bear Pig's calling, I guess that must be Al Gore
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.440]  because there was an announcement
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.720]  that the government even admits,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.120]  okay, the air's been cooling for 16 years now.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.840]  Julio, Ronnie, Scott Free, Wayne, Steve, others
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.480]  will be getting to you coming up.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:24.000]  The number to join us on air is 877-789-ALIX.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.400]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.320]  After the break, we're getting into the reason
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.640]  John Rappaport's joining us.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.280]  He wrote a story about this.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:35.280]  Drugs to improve learning the New York Times.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:37.280]  And it says attention deficit or not,
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.400]  pills to help in school.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.560]  Now, New Freedom has said,
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.360]  that's that big pharma group five years ago,
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.520]  Presidential Commission,
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.840]  they wanna put half the kids on psychotropics
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.920]  and speed drugs.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.120]  There's one of them on them right there.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.120]  Now they are saying that everybody just needs to be on.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.520]  And again, if I said there it is on screen,
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.480]  we're streaming video at prisonplanet.tv
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.640]  for radio listeners.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.200]  And again, John Rappaport wrote an article about this
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.360]  that we ran at infowars.com,
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.160]  breaking down the fact that it is just an incredible crime
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.760]  that's happening, we'll cover that after the break.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:23.480]  But John, what is your take,
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.480]  we only got a few minutes before a break here,
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.000]  on the hype of riots
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.720]  and people saying they're gonna riot
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:31.680]  if Obama doesn't win.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.520]  Again, John is a graduate of Amherst College
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.320]  with a BA in Philosophy and Worked in Freelance,
[01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.720]  investigative reporting, 30 years.
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.040]  He's published the website, nomorefakenews.com.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:41.760]  It's a 2001 and been a radio host as well.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:44.440]  And he's written for major national newspapers
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.400]  and investigative journalism work
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.720]  for a national television.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.080]  I won't get into his whole bio.
[01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:52.360]  But briefly, what's your take on October surprise?
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.160]  Is it financial meltdown, wide war in Syria, Iran?
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.400]  What do you make of this big story
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.960]  that we're seeing all over the place
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.200]  that there may be riots?
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.760]  Well, Alex, it's obvious that this is more,
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.960]  class warfare, race warfare being promoted.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.560]  I mean, here's the idea, let's stir up as much trouble
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.880]  as we possibly can.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:18.240]  Let's predict that all kinds of dire things
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.040]  are gonna happen because then maybe they will.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:24.680]  Because then we, in other words, the controllers,
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.360]  the globalists have a chance to shut down society,
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.800]  declare martial law, go in there with all kinds of troops
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.600]  and bullets, as you've described,
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:35.280]  and weapons and sound weapons
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.640]  and invade towns and cities and inner cities
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.200]  on the pretext that we've got these riots boiling over.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.200]  And then we can say the whole country's melting down
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.600]  and we have to impose tighter controls,
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.920]  more controls, more controls, more controls.
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.920]  So they're trying to float a self-fulfilling prophecy
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.720]  and stir up people all at once
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:01.000]  because they keep publishing these insane comments
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.400]  by people out of nowhere.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.520]  I mean, who cares who these people are,
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.800]  whether they're famous or they're unknown,
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.800]  who are saying, watch out, watch out, if Obama loses,
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.080]  riots are gonna break out,
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.040]  we're not gonna take this kind of stuff.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.680]  I mean, anybody can say this kind of thing,
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.160]  but they make a big deal out of it
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.120]  so that they can then say, well,
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.760]  look, we said it's gonna happen and here it is.
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.280]  They wanna provoke this into happening
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.520]  is what they wanna do.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:29.440]  And then they wanna clamp down on the population
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.440]  and say, we have to protect you, we have to keep you safe,
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.340]  and therefore don't go out at night,
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.200]  we have all kinds of new rules and regulations
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:38.760]  and new surveillance.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.360]  It's like a mini 9-11.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.120]  You know, it's like saying, okay,
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.840]  this was an attack on America, these riots.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.320]  And so I know you folks all want security
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.960]  and we're here to deliver it.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.120]  We've got new stuff you never even heard of before.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.280]  We can spy on everybody all the time
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.040]  and predict what they're gonna do.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.080]  And in that way, everybody's gonna be just fine,
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.760]  everybody's gonna be safe.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.000]  So just take it in the neck
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.280]  as we're gonna give it to you
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.400]  and you'll be safe and protected.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.080]  That's what they're doing and they keep on doing it
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.680]  for different reasons.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.560]  And this whole thing about race riots
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.000]  is just the latest reason they're giving.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.840]  Well, I agree with you, but at the same time,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.800]  we did see the White House try to go in
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.400]  with the Justice Department and hype stuff up
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.800]  with the Trayvon Martin case
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.560]  where Trayvon Martin did later come out.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.560]  I mean, they showed his head all bleeding,
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.280]  he beat him up.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.520]  That's what the witnesses saw,
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:40.920]  including his black neighbor said,
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.600]  no, the kid was on top of and beat him up.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.320]  They showed a photo that was seven years old.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.160]  That's why I call him a kid.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.640]  He was actually a huge man.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.640]  His dad was a gigantic guy.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.360]  And it's sad what happened to Trayvon Martin,
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.800]  but they really wanna get this going.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.640]  And the question is why?
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.000]  We'll be right back to break down
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.440]  the drugging of your children.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.000]  Aaron Fullen here.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  As the food police shut down food co-ops,
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.440]  the Amish and small farmers,
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:06.000]  Americans are losing access,
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses,
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.560]  but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.440]  like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.440]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:16.440]  with living enzymes and healthy bacteria.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.360]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.360]  are so afraid of.
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.760]  These remarkable foods have been around
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.080]  since the beginning of history,
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.120]  with archeological evidence for fermented foods
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.800]  and beverages being found across the globe
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.120]  in almost every culture.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120]  Even today, Japanese eat meat and meat
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.360]  miso, Africans eat fermented porges,
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.280]  Koreans eat kamichi, and in India,
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.600]  fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.680]  But here's some good news.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.080]  South Berlin Americans can now discover the secrets
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.760]  to making these amazing fermented foods
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.920]  legally and privately in their own homes.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.520]  Since it's still legal to make these foods
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.280]  as long as you can make them yourself.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.120]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com.

[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:02.840]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.000]  for tree seekers.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.280]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.520]  over the years on the online video bookstore
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.920]  at infowars.com.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.840]  And out of all the titles we've carried,
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:16.520]  one stands out because it is just so chillingly convincing.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.840]  And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert,
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.200]  available at infowars.com.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.920]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:26.080]  like nothing I've seen.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.560]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is,

[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:39.280]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen,
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.840]  the book that woke me up.
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.960]  We're also carrying behind the green mask,
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.240]  You and a Gender 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.200]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:51.480]  The Greater Good, the most professional and up-to-date film
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:55.000]  I've ever seen, exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.960]  These titles and a lot more are all available

[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.640]  With recent regulations threatening

[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.560]  between ionic silver, colloidal silver,
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:49.760]  and what most silver solution manufacturers are producing,
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.160]  please visit our website at www.silverlungs.com
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.720]  for more information on why you should be producing

[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.400]  The worst drought in 50 years continues,
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.760]  and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.840]  half year on record.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.400]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.200]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables,
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:14.760]  and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.040]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.720]  and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.480]  The only strategy to counter this
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:24.120]  is to freeze your food cost at today's prices
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.320]  by getting your own supply of foods from E-Foods Direct now.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.480]  As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.200]  E-Foods will have to raise prices too.
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.960]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.360]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.040]  because we've all known this was coming.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.960]  You know about their delicious long-term storeable foods.

[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.800]  you're locking in today's prices
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.280]  and avoiding the rising food cost.

[01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:21.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:26.080]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:32.480]  Okay, if you're just joining us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.080]  We've got investigative journalist John Rappaport
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.080]  on the line with us via video Skype.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.280]  You can watch it at prisonplanet.tv
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:42.080]  or infowarsnews.com if you're a radio listener

[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:48.080]  If you go back to 2006,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.080]  the Associated Press, WorldNet Daily, others reported it.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]  We covered it.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.080]  One of the board members of the National Presidential Commission
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.080]  had a pang of conscience and went public.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.080]  You can pull up these articles and said,
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.080]  this was written by a big pharma.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080]  It's called the New Freedom Initiative,
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:07.080]  very Orwellian name like the Patriot Act,
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:11.080]  and it seeks to get half of the kids in America
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:15.080]  on psychotropic drugs with guidelines written by big pharma
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:19.080]  to have the school nurse, the school counselor pushing on them.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.080]  Now, Ron Paul's sponsored a bill.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:24.080]  They shot most of it down in 2006.
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:29.080]  Now, six years ago, seven years ago.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:32.080]  If you expand on that, they're back,
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:35.080]  and there's a big PR push that, oh, everybody's going to get
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.080]  free screening, isn't it great?
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:40.080]  It's kind of like getting a call, hey, you get a free duffel bag
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.080]  if you come to this timeshare meeting,
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.080]  and it's a 14-hour sales pitch,
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.080]  or it's like being put on the rack and being tortured.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.080]  Well, this is much worse.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:53.080]  This is, hey, everybody gets free psychological screening
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:56.080]  of young children.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.080]  From pre-K right up to college,
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.080]  you're going to get a psychological screening with guidelines.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.080]  And the guidelines, we read these on air earlier in the week.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:10.080]  It says, don't trust authorities, have anxiety,
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.080]  have trouble sleeping, sometimes get angry.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:17.080]  Well, you need to be on drugs. That's it.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080]  And John has an article.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:20.080]  It's up at infowars.com, bombshell,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.080]  mind control engineers now drugging children for social justice.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.080]  That's a quote.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.080]  And we have the head of the Texas Psychiatry Board,
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:31.080]  at least he was the head of it at the time,
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.080]  five, six years ago in my film Endgame.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:35.080]  He was asked by Representative Susanna Hupp
[01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.080]  of the Texas Legislature,
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.080]  why are 69% of Texas foster kids,
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.080]  and by the way, that happens to be the national average too,
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:44.080]  on up to seven psychotropic, or that's the average,
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:46.080]  69% around seven.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.080]  He said, well, they come from bad gene pools.
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.080]  She goes, do you do gene tests?
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:52.080]  No, they just have bad gene pools.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.080]  So it's really eugenics.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.080]  And now they're saying, I mean, here it is in New York Times,
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.080]  all over the place.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.080]  Oh, it's not just for problem kids,
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.080]  or kids with bad grades.
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.080]  Everybody needs to be drugged now.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.080]  So they're not just saying 50%,
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.080]  they're saying Ritalin Prozac's good for you.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:14.080]  John, break down this bombshell information.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.080]  Unbelievable, Alex.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.080]  I thought I'd heard everything.
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.080]  We got these doctors who are now saying,
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.080]  well, here's the thing, if you're raised in a poor family
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:28.080]  in the inner city, then there's no way you're going to get
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.080]  a level playing field, especially in school,
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.080]  with kids from families that have more money.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.080]  So on behalf of, get this quote, social justice,
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:43.080]  we have to put all these kids on Ritalin Adderall,
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:48.080]  which are speed drugs that are prescribed for ADHD.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.080]  We don't care what they have, what the diagnosis is or isn't.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.080]  We just have to get these kids on these drugs
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:57.080]  so that they can perform better in school.
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.080]  And so that's what we're doing.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.080]  And forget that Adderall, all these drugs have been proven
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.080]  to shrink the brain, swell the heart,
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:07.080]  all sorts of growth stunting, burning them out.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.080]  The New York Times says, look at this great kid,
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:11.080]  and he's got huge black circles around his eyes,
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.080]  looks like a zombie.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.080]  It's like, your kid needs this too.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.080]  So now you're a racist if you don't want to put
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.080]  all the inner city kids on speed.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.080]  Exactly.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.080]  And this kid actually was eventually put
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.080]  into a psychiatric institution
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:27.080]  because he was reacting so badly to Adderall,
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.080]  and then eventually they put him on an even more powerful drug,
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:33.080]  Risperdal, which can just directly cause brain damage,
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:35.080]  I mean, in lots and lots of people.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.080]  So what they're doing here is,
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.080]  now here's where the craziest part is.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.080]  You see, they're calling this social justice.
[01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:48.080]  Well, you add in to this volatile mix in inner cities.
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.080]  You've already got violence.
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:53.080]  You've got extreme poverty, no jobs, high crime rate,
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080]  terrible schools, and all the rest of it.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080]  Now you're going to light a match,
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080]  and you're going to pour it on that flame
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.080]  because these drugs, like Adderall and Ritalin and so forth,
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:09.080]  because they are speed, they increase violent behavior.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:13.080]  So now you're going to add that final piece to it, right?
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.080]  And now guess what happens when you back up,
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.080]  and you've got thousands of kids who are in that environment
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.080]  on these drugs.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.080]  You're going to get a tremendous upsurge in violent crime.
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:25.080]  That's what you're going to get.
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:28.080]  And this is what some people will remember.
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.080]  Gary Webb, famous journalist who's been dead now
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.080]  for a number of years, wrote a series in the San Jose Mercury
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.080]  called Dark Alliance, in which he showed that
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.080]  in South Central Los Angeles, poverty-stricken community,
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.080]  the CIA was permitting and assisting crack cocaine
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.080]  to come into South LA and to destroy that community
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:54.080]  because the money that was coming from that
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.080]  was funding the so-called war on Nicaragua
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.080]  that the United States was covertly.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080]  Sounds like fast and furious.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.080]  I've seen studies, other people can pull these up,
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:06.080]  but have you been on Ritalin or these other speed drugs
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.080]  that you were up to five times more likely
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.080]  to become addicted and seek out illegal drugs?
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080]  So before the drug pushers went,
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:18.080]  hey, kid, come here on the playground,
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.080]  now they go, oh, we're liberal.
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.080]  Here, little five-year-old black kid,
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:26.080]  take this when they know it causes all sorts of problems.
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.080]  And they're just saying, we're going to target you, period,
[01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.080]  because I saw some articles this week saying,
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.080]  black and Hispanic kids on this and poor white kids,
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:36.080]  and now they're saying, oh, put all the kids on it
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.080]  because the drugs help everyone, period.
[01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:40.080]  I mean, this is how much more out of control
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:42.080]  does big pharma have to get?
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:45.080]  I mean, they're total drug pushers, period.
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.080]  Total drug pushers.
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.080]  And as I cite in my article on this,
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:52.080]  the most authoritative study on these drugs
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:55.080]  shows that over the long term,
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:57.080]  they don't improve school performance.
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.080]  They don't improve learning.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.080]  So this whole social justice nonsense wrap
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:05.080]  that they're delivering, oh, level playing field,
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.080]  better school performance, that's a total lie, too,
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.080]  because the drugs don't deliver that.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.080]  Absolutely not.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:13.080]  So the whole thing is insane.
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.080]  I overheard a doctor some years ago,
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.080]  I mean, he was a well-known doctor who was saying,
[01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.080]  at a party, he was standing there talking to people,
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.080]  and he said, what we have to do is put Ritalin
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.080]  in the water supply.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080]  That's what these people want to do.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.080]  They want to just say, these are good drugs.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.080]  Everybody should be on them.
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.080]  So let's forget prescribing them.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080]  Let's just sell it.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.080]  And by the way, by the way, you're not just saying that.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.080]  That's what's frustrating about this.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.080]  I know we have listeners tuning in.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080]  They're like, oh, yeah, right.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:43.080]  I've got Fox News, CNN, you name it.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.080]  We need Ritalin in the water.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.080]  We need Prozac in the water.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.080]  We need statins in the water.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:51.080]  Japan's looking at putting Lithium in the water.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.080]  An anti-psychotic that brain damages you.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.080]  And it's so over the top.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:59.080]  Oh, unbelievable, unbelievable.
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:00.080]  Look at this.
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.080]  This is from WebMD, ADHD and substance abuse.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.080]  Alcohol and drugs connected.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:09.080]  And then it goes on to say that, yeah, it's a gateway drug.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.080]  No kidding, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:14.080]  I mean, I've known people on Ritalin and these other drugs.
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.080]  They're total out of control.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.080]  They just fry these kids' brains.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.080]  It's true.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.080]  It makes them sit down and shut up later.
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:26.080]  And I love how they pump these kids full of Diet Coke
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.080]  and sugar and all this stuff.
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.080]  They have horrible GMO diets.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.080]  They're bouncing off the walls.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.080]  They're watching television all day that wires the brain bad.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.080]  That's major studies.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.080]  And then you wonder why the kid's out of control.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.080]  And they take discipline out of the home and the school
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080]  so the kids are out of control.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:45.080]  And don't worry, the government comes in and says,
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.080]  we're going to kick your kid out of school
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:49.080]  if you don't put them on Prozac and Ritalin.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.080]  And when they grab your two-year-old, the CPS, and they cry,
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:55.080]  they put them on a bunch of drugs and turn them into zombies as well
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.080]  and all their teeth fall out.

[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:22.080]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.080]  at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.080]  from e-foods direct now.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.080]  As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.080]  e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.080]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.080]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.080]  because we've all known this was coming.
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:39.080]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.080]  The fact is you can eat it anytime to save money today
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.080]  and because it stores for 25 years,
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.080]  you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.080]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633

[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:35.080]  All right, we're going to some of your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.080]  They'll be all over the map, but John Rappaport,
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:39.080]  investigative journalist, can cover it.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.080]  His website's nomorphakenews.com.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:42.080]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:46.080]  My websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:48.080]  Don't forget, coming up later in this week,
[01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:52.080]  I'm going to do a 48-hour transmission and I'll be live.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.080]  I don't know, Chris, how many hours in my life?
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.080]  Something like 15, 20 hours of it.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:34:00.080]  I'll be hosting over the two days, at least 20.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.080]  Wow.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.080]  And we're going to have a lot of other guest hosts,
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:06.080]  special guests and a huge raft of guests.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.080]  And it is fundraising to get our satellite uplinks
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.080]  and some final equipment to expand my nightly TV show.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.080]  And we're not like government that comes in forcefully,
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:17.080]  takes things at gunpoint and then gives it to their own media systems
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.080]  to propagandize.
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:21.080]  When you buy the books, the videos, the water filters,
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.080]  all of it at infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.080]  It funds us.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:26.080]  When you support our sponsors, it funds us.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.080]  When you sponsor our local AM and FM stations, it funds us.
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:32.080]  But we also, this will be the fifth annual money bomb.
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.080]  And we've raised up to a half million dollars before.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.080]  That sounds like a lot.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.080]  It's really not when you're talking about equipment and crew
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.080]  and things.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.080]  But it is an important part of our funding system.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.080]  So we'll be having that money bomb.
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.080]  infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.080]  You can start donating now.

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.080]  Deliver to your door.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.080]  That counts the shipping.
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.080]  Shipping's more than half our cost.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.080]  Or you can buy them in bulk and groups of 10 are up to 100.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:17.080]  10 copies for $14.95.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.080]  They're basically like a big color book covering the globalist
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.080]  activities.
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.080]  Great way to wake people up.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.080]  Everybody's getting out of print.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.080]  Well, we dominate the web.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.080]  We're getting back into print.
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:31.080]  So again, infowarsstore.com to find all of that.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.080]  OK, going back to John Rappaport.
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:37.080]  John, when I read this New York Times article about some kids
[01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:42.080]  taken because they're throwing fits instead of being disciplined
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.080]  or being fed right, they're putting psychiatric facilities now
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.080]  for throwing fits.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.080]  There are resting kids who throw fits.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.080]  And then you read about Skinner and all these guys.
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.080]  They said, don't let parents spank their kids.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.080]  They'll act like animals.
[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:56.080]  Then they'll be a societal crisis.
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.080]  We'll take over.
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:01.080]  And they describe when Dr. Michael Anderson hears about low-income
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.080]  parents struggling in elementary schools,
[01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.080]  he usually gives them a taste of some powerful medicine.
[01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:08.080]  And that's what we're talking about.
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:10.080]  We're talking about the big pharma companies.
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.080]  We're talking about the big pharma companies that had a role.
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:17.080]  The pills boost focus and impulse control in children with
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.080]  attention deficit or productivity disorder.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.080]  But it goes on to say, now we just want to give them to everybody.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.080]  I mean, how far will we let big pharma go?
[01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:28.080]  I mean, talk about the scandals that just came out in the last
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.080]  month, where all these big pharma companies got caught selling
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:34.080]  drugs they knew were killing people and didn't protect them.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080]  And they were the ones that did this.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:38.080]  I mean, there is no big deal.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.080]  So I think there is no big deal.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.080]  I mean, I mean, it's not just about the kids that have polyo
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.080]  vaccination.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:45.080]  You have hundreds of thousands of kids in India,
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.080]  a polio vaccine that ends up paralyzing tens of thousands of
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.080]  them.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.080]  It's in the news, but it's like no big deal.
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:55.080]  I mean, it, it's just, we've gotten so accustomed to this
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:58.080]  medical tyranny, John Rappaport.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.080]  It's so incredible, Alex.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.080]  Let's take that Bill Gates polio vaccine in India.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:08.560]  that in any half sane society, you got a celebrity billionaire Bill Gates, you got his big program
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:16.240]  to vaccinate the world, you got 47,000 cases of paralysis in India as a result of the vaccine.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.360]  I mean, I've been in media for the last 30 years. Is that a big story or what? I mean,
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:26.720]  how about a headline in the New York Times? How about the CBS Evening News leads with that and
[01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:33.440]  says, wow, look at this, and we're trying to get Bill Gates on here, but so far, it's difficult.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.120]  You know, I mean, you got a story, everybody in the world is going to be glued.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:43.440]  Did you know Bill Gates funds CNN, ABC News, CBS, NBC, The London Guardian,
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:49.440]  and hundreds of other publications, they spend close to a billion bucks a year paying media.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:55.760]  And when you think a health story is, is, is sometimes they'll have buried at the bottom
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.760]  that it's all part of this foundation. And then that foundation is funded by them.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:05.680]  Did you know that, John? Yes. And that's why that's why these media outlets won't cover it that way.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:11.040]  You see, because I mean, just from the point of view of a reporter and an editor, you're always
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:16.720]  looking for a gigantic story to sell newspapers. But if you're already sold out to Bill Gates,
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:22.160]  who's funding you, then you say, well, we can't run that. People ask why the dinosaur media is
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:26.880]  dying. It's because they can't help it. They're, it's not media. Look, they've got the guy that
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:32.560]  made Super Size Me, a spurlock coming out with a film breaking for the first time
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:39.120]  that a lot of news has been paid for. Folks for 30 years, but, but the last five or six completely,
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:46.160]  every TV show, people in Hollywood is mainly funded, not by the advertisers, but by government
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:55.520]  tax money to have anti-gun, anti-family garbage in it, pro-Obamacare garbage. I mean, people don't
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:03.360]  understand. It's propaganda by the very definition. Absolutely. And if anybody in the major media
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:08.000]  wanted to take a look at this whole business about drugging kids for social justice, it would
[01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.320]  take them 10 minutes to realize that this is really a covert operation. And the purpose of it is
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.880]  really at the top to increase violence in inner cities. That's what it is, because you're giving
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:27.360]  drugs to kids indiscriminately that create violent behavior. And then the answer will be more drugs.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:31.520]  And the answer will be more drugs and more suppression of violence by the cops,
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:37.120]  you know, and, and riots and all of the above. They've got it all figured out. Unbelievable.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.640]  But, but, but again, that's only one angle you're talking about in the roll out of the
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.080]  New Freedom Initiative. I'm sure you saw all the articles. They were everywhere this week,
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:48.080]  just saying, everybody's got to have a flu shot. You're going to give your neighbor the flu.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.760]  And everybody's got to start taking Ritalin and Prozac because it boosts your IQ. I mean, I mean,
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:00.000]  they're actually it's like a idiocracy or something. Yeah, completely. I wrote a story,
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:05.440]  I don't know, five, six days ago about a very well respected research group called the Cochrane
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:11.040]  Collaboration. They went back and they looked at every single flu vaccine study they could find
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:16.880]  historically. They put it through the meat grinder to pick the very best studies and they came up
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:25.600]  with the conclusion that for healthy adults, no flu vaccine whatsoever of any type stops the
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:31.680]  flu from happening. And neither does it stop the transmission of flu viruses between people.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:38.160]  I mean, this is an incredible revelation. The flu vaccine is totally useless. That's what this
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.880]  extremely scientific group discovered. And here you've got the government hammering away and the
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.520]  doctors hammering away and people in pharmacies, you've got to get the flu shot, you've got to get
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:54.640]  the flu shot. Otherwise, you're a trader and un-American. It's all baloney. It's complete,
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:02.240]  absolute hogwash. They're just pushing this down everybody's throat because it debilitates people.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.440]  That's what it really does, Alex. The drugs and the vaccines make people weaker. They make the more
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.120]  out of control. They make them less able to think or function. They make them easier to control in
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:18.320]  the long run. And of course, they make trillions for the pharmaceutical companies and the government
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:23.440]  and those drug companies are in this whole operation hand in glove and have been for a very,
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:30.000]  very long time. They're literally zombified. I showed this last week on the show and we come
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.320]  back from break and then take a few calls with John Rappaport here on the Sunday news show. Again,
[01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.600]  if you're just tuning in, I'm Alex Jones, your host. Look, I showed a whole bunch of newspaper
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.480]  articles last Sunday all saying, get your shot or you'll make your neighbor sick. It's your
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:50.480]  responsibility. Parade magazine, Texas newspapers, you name it. And they had quotes like, don't listen
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:57.840]  to wild rumors. There's never been any side effect from a flu shot. So I printed off and showed TV
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:04.400]  viewers, but radio listeners told them where to go, gave the URL to the CDC saying death, paralysis,
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:12.960]  narcolepsy, permanent seizures, which is epilepsy, autoimmune shutdown, cancer. It's 20 pages
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:19.280]  saying it'll kill you, vaccines. It says it on the stinking inserts and here are articles going,
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.280]  don't listen to conspiracy theorists. There's never been one problem, John. Not one, John.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:32.720]  That's why they've got this whole flush fund, as you said, to pay off people privately, secretly,
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:38.960]  quietly, whose kids have been brain damaged and destroyed by vaccines. That's why they can't
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.160]  sue the government because the government pharmaceutical companies made a deal about 15,
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:49.440]  20 years ago that no longer would a private citizen be able to say to a big drug company,
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:55.680]  you destroyed my child's life for that time. 1986. Yeah, absolutely. And they use our tax money
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:59.360]  to pay it off and then gag the families and then say we're conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:05.680]  Aaron Fulin here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.080]  are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home crafted
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:14.320]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir. It seems there's a war on
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.800]  life giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly, I'm not sure what the food
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:22.720]  police are so afraid of. These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history,
[01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:26.800]  with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:32.000]  almost every culture. Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.880]  eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living. But here's some good news,
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.880]  self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:45.120]  legally and privately in their own homes. Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:51.280]  you can make them yourself, for more information check out fermentationfactor.com. That's fermentationfactor.com.

[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:30.880]  All right, last Sunday I mentioned this on my radio because I know people listening all over the
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:35.440]  U.S. but all over the world are bombarded with the same propaganda. It's the same globalist
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:41.520]  think tanks, same lies. And you'll just see newspaper articles every flu season lying and
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:47.440]  saying 36,000 die when the real numbers are about 1,000 to 1,100. All of them infirm are having
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.360]  medical problems. You'll see before school every year saying it's the law to take your shots.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.480]  There is no law. They're trying to pass laws. I mean, it's just mass hoaxing. But if you're
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:04.080]  watching on PrisonPlanet.tv or a stream video, here is an article out of the Longview News Journal
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:09.120]  here in Texas. And it says, take your medicine, getting a flu shot as part of being a good neighbor.
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.640]  And it's the same story that I've heard the medical shows that you're going to give your
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.480]  neighbor the flu if you don't take it. I thought if they had the shot, they were protected.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:21.520]  Because everybody I know that gets the flu gets it from the shot,
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:25.040]  which they now admit in the studies, but continuing. Listen, as it says,
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:29.360]  there is absolutely no harm from getting a vaccination. Don't let yourself be fooled by
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.720]  wild rumors. They give no facts, no hyperlinks, and it's the same literally in hundreds of articles.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:41.440]  There is no side effects. Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero. We're going back to John Rabaport
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:47.680]  here in a moment. But here's the cdc.gov. Okay, and just go there and type in vaccines,
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:54.640]  immunizations, possible side effects from vaccines. And it listed all here. And this,
[01:48:54.640 --> 01:49:00.800]  this is just a boil down that is 20 pages. It's thousands of pages if you click on each one.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:05.440]  But let me just give you mild problems, headaches, upper respiratory tract infection.
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:13.120]  That's about one in three gets that stuffy nose, sore throat, joint pain, one in six,
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:18.000]  abdominal pain, one in seven, diarrhea. Gee, I wonder what else is happening about one in ten,
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:24.560]  fever about one in a hundred. Oh, it gives you fever, blood and urine in the stool,
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.000]  pneumonia, inflammation of stomach contestants. Oh yeah, all the new increases in stomach disorders
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.480]  and Crohn's directly linked to vaccines. Oh, I'm on page one. You want me to continue here?
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:40.160]  Here, let me just go through here. Some of these for you. I mean, it's got death in here,
[01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:48.560]  you name it. Long term seizures, coma, lowered consciousness. Oh, you mean brain damage,
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:54.960]  US IQs by the way are down. Permanent brain damage, seizures, nonstop crying. That's moderate
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:04.880]  problems. High fever, 105 degrees. That's from the DTAP vaccine. We take the tetanus shot. I mean,
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:13.600]  just death, autoimmune disorder. Oh, hey, but John, we're conspiracy theorists. We're liars.
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.000]  We're rumor mongers. We're scum because the Longview Journal, along with the Parade Magazine,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.640]  everybody else, they told me there was never a problem, John. Do you want to apologize on air
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:30.800]  for being a piece of trash, John, like me? We're both going to bow down and apologize. Yeah,
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:36.800]  that's going to happen when the world ends. So here's the deal. That study that I mentioned
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:43.760]  in the last segment there, that proved, in fact, that the flu vaccine doesn't stop the
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:50.480]  transmission of flu viruses between anybody. So when they say, oh, your kid has to get his vaccine,
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:57.280]  otherwise he might give my kid the virus. Well, there's two arguments. You cited one of them.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.080]  If your kid is already protected by the vaccine, what are you worrying about? And the second is,
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.360]  oh, now we understand that the vaccine does prevent the transmission of viruses anyway.
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:13.280]  They just go all over the place. So this whole nonsense about herd immunity is just a bunch
[01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:18.400]  of baloney that somebody cooked up in a PR department at the Centers for Disease Control.
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:24.720]  It's all a gigantic hoax. And it's destructive because, as you heard Alex reading,
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:30.160]  the adverse effects here, they don't stop. When you have some high thing called high-pitched
[01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:35.440]  screaming and high fever, you're talking about brain damage. That's what that is.
[01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:40.720]  And people, kids get that all the time from the DA. Oh, I can't tell you how many people I know
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:45.600]  who went in for their four-month-old to get more shots, and the kid dies on the way home,
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.160]  and the police try to arrest them saying, you must have beaten them because there's blood on
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:55.200]  their brain. When they know in the adverse reactions, it causes an autoimmune problem in
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:52:00.320]  the brain and a ballooning. I mean, they know it. They don't just kill your kid,
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.560]  they try to throw you in jail after they murder him or brain damage him because the
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:11.360]  stink in death camp hospital, it's got to be let off the hook. Exactly. Or if the kid doesn't die,
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:16.640]  then they put you through a lifetime of misery as you try to extract from the government
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:25.120]  who's guaranteed the vaccine and told you to get it enough money to give your brain damaged child
[01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:31.680]  some sort of support for the rest of his or her life. They put you through the mill.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:36.480]  Oh, they wouldn't do that even though they took 4,000-plus foster kids and radiated them to death,
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:39.600]  even though they sprayed St. Louis with nerve gas, even though the London
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.600]  independence reporting on massive increases in birth defects in Iraq and in our troops today,
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:51.360]  the government loves us and wouldn't do anything. I mean, they care. We should take extra shots.
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:55.280]  I don't want to be a bad conspiracy theorist now. Let's just take some calls here.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:00.240]  Let's go to Man Bear Pig in Pennsylvania. I guess Al Gore called in. Al Gore,
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:04.080]  there's a new big study. Daily Mail reports the earth's been cooling for 16 years.
[01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:08.080]  Should I pay you tax money to save the earth, Man Bear Pig?
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:11.520]  You should take your shots, Alex, like you're supposed to, you and John.
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.560]  Oh, wow. Are you living inside the lockbox yourself now?
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:23.280]  Hey, great show, guys, and you're touching on the most important thing with Obamacare coming up.
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:26.480]  I mean, what's going to happen? Are we all going to have to? Are we going to be mandated to take
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:31.760]  our shots like that? Well, the IRS enforces it. What's wrong with that? You bet. That's exactly
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:36.320]  what's up the road. You're not a racist, are you, Man Bear Pig? You're a racist if you don't want
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:42.080]  government running your health care. And I don't want to vote for Romney or for Obama. Oh, racist,
[01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:48.960]  racist, racist. Yeah, you're a double racist. Thank you for all you do, Alex, and everything you
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:52.880]  throw out there. During your money bomb, how about you get your dad on full bed? You guys are
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.680]  such so great together that one time you had him on there. That's a good idea. Drag my pop in here.
[01:53:57.680 --> 01:54:01.680]  Hey, my wife's been wanting to go in there, but she's never wanted to do it. Maybe we'll get her
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:06.560]  in here. Thank you for the call, buddy. Let's jam in another here. Let's talk to Scott Free.
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:13.200]  That sounds terrorist in Colorado. You better support. I'm sorry, Teres, go ahead.
[01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:18.240]  You better believe I'm extremist, Alex. And to touch on the topic they were talking about before
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:23.920]  with the Obamianist and how they're going to, they're going to cause a riot. Oh, my gosh.
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.280]  I was at the Mitt Romney and Obama debate out here. And I was saying, oh,
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:35.680]  Obama out of the bullhorn I have. I was knocking doors for my business. And the guy said, no,
[01:54:35.680 --> 01:54:41.200]  he runs down the street and he's like, you're Obama guy. I recognize you. But I suggested for
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.120]  the show, Alex, when you start off in the morning, you should have one of your co-hosts
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:51.360]  doing news blitz. So he gets through everything and then you can come out and pontificate as
[01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:55.840]  you do so well. No, I need to shut up and actually cover more of the news. Good point.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:02.240]  All right. Let's go ahead and talk to Wayne in Arkansas. You're on the air with other evil
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:07.120]  extremists that actually read the vaccine insert where it says it can kill us and then get freaked
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:11.680]  out when the news says it can't hurt us. Oh, sorry. I'll go ahead extremist. You're on the air, Wayne.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.400]  I guess Wayne doesn't like being called an extremist. No. Okay. Bye-bye, Wayne. Burt in
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.840]  Texas. You're on the air. Burt, Burt. Good afternoon, Alex. Hey, buddy. How's it going today?
[01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:30.160]  It's going great. Kudos from Judge Tom Heds County out here in Lubbock.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:33.520]  Welcome, sir. What's on your mind? We got about two minutes left.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:39.680]  Well, I just want to let you know I woke up in January of this year, but I didn't hear the alarm
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:47.120]  when you woke me up back when I listened in January. Well, I'm glad that you...
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:54.080]  How do you define waking up? I mean, you realize all is not well in the state of Denmark? Well,
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:59.280]  I was aware that things were not right, but it's kind of like some people wake up in the morning,
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:05.040]  they hear the alarm, they wake up immediately. Other people are not morning people. No, I hear you.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.680]  Look, look, they're telling you in the news there's no side effects and it's the law to take vaccines.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:17.040]  There's not a law and there are a ton of deadly side effects and it's a fraud. They've never
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:23.120]  guessed the right flu for that year and it reduces your IQ and it makes you get the flu the next year.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:28.480]  These are all mainline studies and it's so frustrating to be informed and know the globalists
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:32.640]  are counting on us not being informed. I appreciate you joining us. We're out of time. Sorry to
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:40.160]  Christine and so many others that are holding. Great job to our fabulous crew in here. In the
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:47.440]  last minute, we've got here any other points you'd like to make, John Rappaport. Just one point, Alex.
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:53.520]  We've got to maintain the freedom to say no to medications or vaccines of any kind. That's the
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:58.320]  bottom line here. Whatever people know, whatever they don't know, however well they're informed or
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:06.000]  badly informed at all costs, we've got to maintain the freedom to say no. I don't want that. I don't
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.960]  want that for my kid. I don't want that for me. Other people want it. That's up to them. But
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.440]  freedom, as always, is the ultimate protection here and that's what we're talking about.
[01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:19.600]  And as you know, they've gone from hoaxing saying it's the law to take vaccines. They're going,
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.680]  okay, we need a law and they're really trying to get laws in and trying to make
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:26.320]  first responders and people take shots. Folks, don't do it.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:31.600]  Don't do it. Don't do it. John, I'm going to put you on hold here at the end of the show
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:35.360]  because I want to set you up for sometime during the 48-hour broadcast. This is coming up Thursday
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.600]  and Friday. Everybody can listen to it at infowars.com. But great job, my friends. Thanks for joining
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:44.080]  us. And thank you to the listeners. Thank you. And thank you to the crew. I'll see you back tomorrow.
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:58:08.080]  11 a.m. Central. Lord willing, infowars.com.
