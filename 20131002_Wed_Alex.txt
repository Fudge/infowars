[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.840 --> 00:41.720]  well they're reporting that author Tom Clancy has died they don't know the cause
[00:41.720 --> 00:45.800]  of death right now thought I'd throw that out right up front before I end up
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.160]  never even talking about it and I guess he was kind of the symbol of
[00:50.160 --> 00:56.600]  Americana pro-U.S. military really propaganda but he wrote some good
[00:56.600 --> 01:02.840]  books he is now dead and that's fitting that that should happen when the
[01:02.840 --> 01:07.360]  there's a government shutdown and when all over the world a different pundits
[01:07.360 --> 01:11.280]  are saying this is the beginning of the end of the American Empire well there
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.400]  was never an American Empire it was a financial globalist corporate Empire
[01:17.400 --> 01:24.280]  that has used this country to basically set up its own planetary regime and by
[01:24.280 --> 01:29.000]  the way David Knight was on the nightly news with me last night breaking some
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.160]  really big news that's hiding in plain view that the Asian Union the Pacific
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.480]  Union as it's known the North American Union and the EU all part of the
[01:37.480 --> 01:44.320]  trilateral program are all basically merging right now and so we're going to
[01:44.320 --> 01:50.440]  have David Knight with us at the start of the next hour for about 20 minutes to
[01:50.440 --> 01:55.720]  break that down today and go back into what he covered last night it's so
[01:55.720 --> 01:59.200]  important I want you to hear this live and fresh here on the air with some of
[01:59.200 --> 02:03.880]  the new developments they're meeting on the 19th meeting of the Pacific Union to
[02:03.880 --> 02:08.560]  merge it and this is all happening and its corporations above government that
[02:08.560 --> 02:15.320]  are making all of the major decisions so this is a big big deal and it is
[02:15.320 --> 02:19.760]  coming up at the start of the next hour Tosh Plumlee the big whistleblower who's
[02:19.760 --> 02:23.880]  the famous Iran contra whistleblower before that a whistleblower for the
[02:23.880 --> 02:29.560]  church committee hearings on the just incredible info he brought out last week
[02:29.560 --> 02:35.080]  I want to see if he's had any repercussions or if any threats since
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.120]  he came on I know Fox News has also been contacting us wanting to talk to him
[02:39.120 --> 02:42.760]  so I'm gonna ask him on air today if he wants me to give him that number and
[02:42.760 --> 02:46.400]  things I know they were contacting him a few weeks ago and they he didn't want to
[02:46.400 --> 02:49.960]  talk to him but we'll see what's happening on that front before he gets
[02:49.960 --> 02:53.800]  called again to testify to Congress he's still because that's how the
[02:53.800 --> 03:00.280]  bureaucracy works as a private pilot flying weapons for the CIA and there he
[03:00.280 --> 03:04.960]  is saying he talked to a high-level NATO officer and others that indeed they
[03:04.960 --> 03:08.640]  were just sending weapons from the United States and Europe into Benghazi
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.240]  that it wasn't a arms deal gone bad that it was basically the word is getting
[03:14.240 --> 03:20.440]  rid of witnesses the ambassador it's a big deal and it's kind of like the
[03:20.440 --> 03:27.240]  second you know the number two man over the US nuclear forces was suspended and
[03:27.240 --> 03:30.560]  then almost arrested but now they've dropped the charges for trying to pass
[03:30.560 --> 03:36.640]  reportedly fake casino chips counterfeit chips that sounds like a setup to me I
[03:36.640 --> 03:40.480]  mean I can't believe they've got people over the nuclear forces that are
[03:40.480 --> 03:44.960]  degenerate gamblers it just sounds like a setup and you tie that in to the
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.640]  missing nukes out of Dias Air Force Base you know that's a real story just
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.760]  like the bin Laden raid being fake is real you know our report on that Psy
[03:55.760 --> 03:59.480]  Hirsch now going public saying it's a hundred percent false and even the
[03:59.480 --> 04:05.520]  nation magazine a total establishment publication had an article out about
[04:05.520 --> 04:11.440]  Psy Hirsch going public and we're just freaking out saying they want more out
[04:11.440 --> 04:15.280]  of him but Psy Hirsch told us that he wouldn't come on the air because quote
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.880]  he doesn't want to destroy himself he said I don't want to I'm not big into
[04:19.880 --> 04:24.720]  self-immolation that's what like the Buddhist monks like themselves on fire
[04:24.720 --> 04:35.200]  and the world stares the gas at it he's saying it's too dangerous to tell
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.040]  everybody what he knows I think it's dangerous to not tell but we already
[04:39.040 --> 04:41.960]  know what happened we already know there was a lookalike of bin Laden leave
[04:41.960 --> 04:45.720]  another guy's name it's a total setup and the seals figure that out so they
[04:45.720 --> 04:48.920]  had to be killed and they didn't dump the body at sea and there wasn't a
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.400]  situation room meeting that was all fake it's just amazing we're gonna get into

[08:23.440 --> 08:27.880]  resistance it's alex jones
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.040]  last night Michelle Obama the lady that parents all of our children and tells
[08:39.040 --> 08:43.760]  them what to eat my children were going to private school two years ago and they
[08:43.760 --> 08:47.440]  were given a Michelle Obama handouts telling them what to eat and want to do
[08:47.440 --> 08:50.320]  and to fill it out and turn it back in so it can be sent to the federal
[08:50.320 --> 08:53.760]  government because the school was accredited I said no our children will
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.320]  now go back being homeschooled because of that all that federal money that the
[08:59.320 --> 09:03.680]  schools want and that federal accreditation well Michelle Obama came
[09:03.680 --> 09:08.960]  out last night in a tweet 70 plus percent of her followers are reportedly fake on
[09:08.960 --> 09:12.720]  her Twitter but it doesn't matter and said I will not be tweeting anymore
[09:12.720 --> 09:16.760]  because of the government shutdown you've got to love how they still got
[09:16.760 --> 09:20.920]  their force one they've still got the private chefs they've still got all the
[09:20.920 --> 09:27.360]  lavish everything they've still got the homeland security programs and they've
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.000]  still got the giant NSA command centers and they're still got the aircraft
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.160]  taking off to fly ammunition and weapons to al-qaeda they're still running over
[09:37.160 --> 09:43.240]  70% of the government and all they're going to do now is shut down the few
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.520]  services the federal government has and that's being impact and yelled at by
[09:48.520 --> 09:54.360]  park rangers I even did a video report on this a few years ago my mother for her
[09:54.360 --> 09:59.120]  birthday with a pop-up trailer they have wanted my wife and I on the children to
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.360]  go down to the Texas National Seashore down in South Padre and I've been there
[10:04.360 --> 10:08.880]  probably 20 times in my life or more camping probably more than that and I'd
[10:08.880 --> 10:12.000]  been there since it became all federalized it's always been federalized
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.160]  but now literally literally five times a day park rangers would come over to us
[10:20.160 --> 10:24.360]  and get in our face and order us around and bug their eyes out till I finally
[10:24.360 --> 10:29.680]  blew up at them and they would stop and harass each group of people down the
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.960]  beach I mean it was not super crowded but there were cars every 50 yards or so
[10:33.960 --> 10:39.600]  and would boss us around and then they had a checkpoint when you left to see if
[10:39.600 --> 10:44.920]  you were drinking randomly pulling cars over and I'm never going back there and
[10:44.920 --> 10:48.720]  that's what they want I'm sure you heard last year and this year they said
[10:48.720 --> 10:53.000]  that all over the country it's bad for the earth to let you go swimming so
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.120]  depending on the National Seashore you're not allowed to go in past your
[10:57.120 --> 11:02.240]  knees and then they give you a ticket if you do or in some areas you're not
[11:02.240 --> 11:08.000]  allowed to swim period for it for the earth safety and to let the ocean rest
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.440]  okay that's in the Carolina's you name it and
[11:15.320 --> 11:19.720]  these park rangers this morning I was driving into work Richard Reeves was out
[11:19.720 --> 11:22.800]  at my house this morning helping me out with something so he drove in with me
[11:22.800 --> 11:25.120]  and we even shot some video of it I'll try to put it up on a report on the
[11:25.120 --> 11:28.640]  nightly news and all the sudden I'm driving the speed limit and the state
[11:28.640 --> 11:32.440]  trooper shoots up right behind me almost running into me and then just sits
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.080]  there on my tail and I think they must have license plate reading systems
[11:36.080 --> 11:40.600]  they're about to pull me over no then he pulled out from behind me and then
[11:40.600 --> 11:44.960]  drove up and got behind a minivan in the slow lane right behind it he was just
[11:44.960 --> 11:51.120]  messing with people and then he went and kept doing it to other cars and I
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.280]  shot some video of it as he was you know a few hundred yards away doing it to
[11:54.280 --> 11:57.200]  people I'm gonna have to blow it up show folks what he was up to and I think I
[11:57.200 --> 12:02.000]  have his plate number as well but when he drove around me he was bugging his eyes
[12:02.000 --> 12:08.200]  out at me his wife probably was mad at him this morning and imagine imagine
[12:08.200 --> 12:12.880]  this is what tyranny is you take people who are nobody's you take people who
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.280]  would be no one in their life you take people that no one wants to hang out
[12:16.280 --> 12:20.160]  with you take people that would be unsuccessful in business and you give
[12:20.160 --> 12:27.520]  them a badge and a gun and then they can go out and basically road rage around
[12:27.520 --> 12:31.440]  I mean here comes this guy like 80 miles an hour I look up and I see a state
[12:31.440 --> 12:35.720]  police car one of the new Dodge Chargers is a good looking car run right up
[12:35.720 --> 12:41.960]  behind me and then I'm sitting there and I guess he wanted to get off on me
[12:41.960 --> 12:45.840]  panicking or something and I'm sitting there looking and I can't even see his
[12:45.840 --> 12:51.960]  car but by the time it's so close on my bumper and I tell Richard hold the wheel
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.120]  I'm gonna start videotaping this but anyways then he shoots around and
[12:57.120 --> 13:01.720]  starts doing it to other cars and I drove all the way down to 90 or 20 minutes
[13:01.720 --> 13:05.400]  watching him run up behind cars this morning and I know you got a government
[13:05.400 --> 13:08.200]  shutdown all this happening it's just that when I think about the World War
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.880]  two vets who there's now video of the police saying we're gonna arrest you if
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.440]  you try to walk on to the memorial and they've got the government money to have
[13:16.440 --> 13:20.880]  police there and security guards there and to have them put barricades up and
[13:20.880 --> 13:24.960]  that's why Michelle Obama put out the tweet and said I'm not gonna tweet
[13:24.960 --> 13:29.800]  anymore because the government shutdown please don't propagandize us anymore now
[13:29.800 --> 13:36.640]  they're putting up expensive fences all over the place around the other
[13:36.640 --> 13:44.640]  memorials and saying that no one is going to be allowed to get into the
[13:44.640 --> 13:51.120]  Washington the Jefferson the Lincoln and now World War two veterans plan to
[13:51.120 --> 13:57.920]  storm Lincoln Memorial today closed due to Obama administration pettiness and
[13:57.920 --> 14:01.280]  of course I always love old memorials state memorials for no one's there I
[14:01.280 --> 14:04.240]  mean it's it's great to go shoot video there hang out with your kids have a
[14:04.240 --> 14:08.160]  picnic I go to some of the state memorials sometimes there's no need to
[14:08.160 --> 14:13.040]  have anyone there anyway but when you go to these DC memorials and you even try
[14:13.040 --> 14:16.560]  to take photos they'll come over and yell at you because it's about letting you
[14:16.560 --> 14:21.100]  know you're a slave I've talked a lot about this on air the DC memorials and
[14:21.100 --> 14:26.640]  if you try to go there and dance they'll arrest you of course famously Adam
[14:26.640 --> 14:30.280]  Kokesh did that stunt to illustrate their tyranny you can't hand out
[14:30.280 --> 14:34.680]  constitutions in California at the University or they arrest you or give
[14:34.680 --> 14:39.560]  you tickets I mean these are authoritarians two kids in the last day
[14:39.560 --> 14:45.320]  made fingers guns bang bang and got kicked out of school it's a thought
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.040]  crime you can go home and play the violent video games though because that's
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.880]  special interest once you're doing that it's totally legal lawful to have an
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.800]  article about how you fight zombies at the school you get arrested for that
[14:56.800 --> 15:01.200]  now if you write that in fiction class we've seen many cases of that there is
[15:01.200 --> 15:05.680]  no law there is no nothing but there are the corrupt courts the corrupt system
[15:05.680 --> 15:09.480]  especially juvenile courts where there is no jury and they'll just trick the
[15:09.480 --> 15:13.680]  family into putting you on probation waving your rights and signing you up
[15:13.680 --> 15:20.600]  for probation directly this is the tyranny and by the way they know their
[15:20.600 --> 15:26.080]  tyrants they know their tyrants and whereas ten years ago the state police
[15:26.080 --> 15:29.400]  in Texas on average were very professional and nice now when I have
[15:29.400 --> 15:33.760]  run-ins with them especially the new ones they are like drill sergeants and
[15:33.760 --> 15:37.760]  you are the lowest form of garbage like you're a Marine Corps cadet on their
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.880]  first day at boot camp because the message is you let the public know we're
[15:43.880 --> 15:48.960]  in control and watching army psi-op training videos from the 60s that we
[15:48.960 --> 15:52.720]  played here on air in a MF clips and Obama's option to they say that it's
[15:52.720 --> 15:56.760]  important to dominate and have confrontations with the public upfront
[15:56.760 --> 16:02.000]  to intimidate them and let them know you're in control and that's what this
[16:02.000 --> 16:07.320]  is I mean I'm seeing Pentagon occupied country psi-ops and of course the cops
[16:07.320 --> 16:10.200]  don't even know why they're taught this most of them you have police chiefs
[16:10.200 --> 16:13.840]  admit we wear black masks we wear black uniforms we do this to intimidate you
[16:13.840 --> 16:20.200]  it's about a reign of terror where some guy goes and takes a two-year course and
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.480]  now he gets to run up behind vehicles and have road rage and if somebody else
[16:24.480 --> 16:29.360]  did that it's reckless driving and I just have to put up with some lunatic
[16:29.360 --> 16:33.200]  state police guys like when I saw some checkpoint by my parents house a few
[16:33.200 --> 16:38.480]  years ago and of course my iPhone was out of batteries I hadn't charged it

[25:20.320 --> 25:27.080]  use it this is the government holding everything hostage this is the
[25:27.080 --> 25:33.200]  government holding the nation hostage and and it's the new class system where
[25:33.200 --> 25:37.280]  if you're in government you're God if you're not in government your absolute
[25:37.280 --> 25:42.760]  crud it's gang thugism and it jeopardizes everybody and this attitude of
[25:42.760 --> 25:45.960]  tyranny is being pushed because the globalists have seized this country and
[25:45.960 --> 25:50.200]  now they're set in the next hour or so we're gonna be following it and
[25:50.200 --> 25:54.400]  info wars.com and prisonplanet.com and here on the radio on the nightly news
[25:54.400 --> 25:59.640]  tonight very closely because this is how Lexington or Concord could start again
[25:59.640 --> 26:10.920]  back in 1775 on April 19th in Lexington and Concord on the east coast there in
[26:10.920 --> 26:14.160]  what Massachusetts look at that now that's been totally overrun by tyranny
[26:14.160 --> 26:18.040]  once the birthplace of liberty they came to take the guns and the Patriots did
[26:18.040 --> 26:22.600]  and fire first and they said hold your fire don't fire first but if they come
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.960]  for a fight by God they're gonna get one and they came and they fired on the
[26:27.960 --> 26:36.800]  veterans of the French and Indian war and a bunch of more old men and the
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.200]  killing of the old men and the killing of the veterans is what really made
[26:40.200 --> 26:44.200]  everybody angry and I'm telling you this is how it's all gonna start they're
[26:44.200 --> 26:49.120]  gonna kill some kid on video they're gonna beat up some world war two vet or
[26:49.120 --> 26:54.160]  some Korea vet or some Vietnam vet and then it's all over and the globalists
[26:54.160 --> 26:56.800]  have a problem because they've used veterans to push their propaganda of
[26:56.800 --> 27:00.800]  empire and tyranny but now that the veterans are waking up and against their
[27:00.800 --> 27:03.640]  new world order the globalists want to say the veterans of the number one
[27:03.640 --> 27:06.520]  threat because they are the number one threat they could provide the leadership
[27:06.520 --> 27:13.520]  the historical context for people to rally around against the occupiers I mean
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.920]  we are captured on record the globalist brag in the financial times of London the
[27:18.920 --> 27:22.520]  club of Rome the CFR I've made films about it I've showed you the articles
[27:22.520 --> 27:27.840]  that they've captured the planet and that were captured the army war college
[27:27.840 --> 27:35.960]  teaches the top brass this they're hiding this in plain view and they need to
[27:35.960 --> 27:39.600]  now be able to convert things where they say George Washington the founding
[27:39.600 --> 27:43.560]  fathers are bad and the vets are bad today and the gun owners are bad and
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.280]  people that want to keep some of their own property and not be total slaves to
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.560]  the government they're bad and if you don't want the government saying your
[27:50.560 --> 27:53.720]  kids belong to them you're bad and if you think people ought to be able to have
[27:53.720 --> 27:57.720]  a second amendment you're bad and if you love the Bible you're bad you're a
[27:57.720 --> 28:03.320]  bitter-klinger you got a bunch of arrogant so-called intelligentsia that
[28:03.320 --> 28:07.480]  are really authoritarians up there with armed guards protecting their kids at
[28:07.480 --> 28:11.840]  private schools who say we can't have guns to protect ourselves they are a
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.960]  criminal class and they know they are we're gonna go out to break with Charlie
[28:16.960 --> 28:23.080]  Rose talking about threats to arrest the veterans some of the most visible
[28:23.080 --> 28:26.280]  signs of the government shutdown are the national parks and monuments from
[28:26.280 --> 28:30.280]  Arizona's Grand Canyon to Philadelphia's Liberty bale to New York City's Statute
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.520]  of Liberty guards are turning away visitors barricades blocked Washington

[33:35.760 --> 33:42.000]  folks if you go to info wars.com we were playing the Charlie Rose clip it's
[33:42.000 --> 33:46.600]  actually the second clip on the article headlined world war two veterans
[33:46.600 --> 33:51.520]  threatened with arrest over memorial visit and it's the second video where
[33:51.520 --> 33:56.080]  you can see the park service threatening to arrest anyone that goes on the
[33:56.080 --> 34:04.080]  memorial I got recruited back in about 1998 I was on a Chicago affiliate and the
[34:04.080 --> 34:14.040]  fellow that owned it was an Italian American I'm trying to remember his name and he was recruiting people to raise money for the
[34:14.040 --> 34:19.800]  world war two memorial and I remember on air plugging it every week for months
[34:19.800 --> 34:25.600]  for my listeners to donate to the world war two memorial so I remember that I
[34:25.600 --> 34:35.320]  believe it's 100% volunteer paid for they Tom Hanks was promoting it and it was
[34:35.320 --> 34:39.760]  super expensive and I know for a fact that radio station alone with the talk
[34:39.760 --> 34:44.200]  show host raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for it and so they build this
[34:44.200 --> 34:50.080]  thing taxpayers build it and then a bunch of goons and uniforms come and squat
[34:50.080 --> 34:58.060]  on top of it and threaten to arrest people so it's the second video in the
[34:58.060 --> 35:02.440]  article we're playing me Charlie Rose video and we're gonna add some more
[35:02.440 --> 35:10.880]  videos to that to that article as well in fact here is one of the videos where
[35:10.880 --> 35:13.960]  they're threatening to arrest people honor flight is considering going even
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.200]  if the government is still on shutdown but when the organization called the
[35:17.200 --> 35:20.920]  park service they were told they would face arrest I said are you kidding me
[35:20.920 --> 35:24.280]  you're gonna rest in 90 or 91 year old war too better from seeing his memorial
[35:24.280 --> 35:28.240]  if it wasn't for them they wouldn't be there she said that's correct sir 99% of
[35:28.240 --> 35:31.480]  those veterans on honor flights have never had the opportunity to see the
[35:31.480 --> 35:36.880]  memorial now see if the feds who are really globalist occupiers can hike
[35:36.880 --> 35:40.720]  their leg on world war two veterans which are you know held up as the
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.520]  paragon of honor and duty and being heroes and the greatest generation and
[35:45.520 --> 35:50.520]  I agree they were great people and are great people then they can do it to
[35:50.520 --> 35:55.840]  anybody and and that's really what this is all about and they don't care if
[35:55.840 --> 35:59.800]  you're awake to Obamacare being a fraud they don't care now if some polls show
[35:59.800 --> 36:03.920]  80% against it they don't care of your learning that it's taxes on poor people
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.920]  and makes most folks go from 40 hours to 29 hours or less they don't care if you
[36:08.920 --> 36:13.840]  learn now it's over suckers they got Homeland Security in place and they
[36:13.840 --> 36:17.440]  don't think you can ever dislodge them Homeland Security now admits they're
[36:17.440 --> 36:22.780]  set up for us for gun owners libertarians conservatives returning
[36:22.780 --> 36:26.240]  veterans anybody that doesn't like the Federal Reserve this is in all their
[36:26.240 --> 36:32.480]  manuals anybody who knows they're a foreign occupational army who knows the
[36:32.480 --> 36:37.480]  globalist have captured this country and again we're gonna have David Knight in
[36:37.480 --> 36:46.480]  at 8 after next hour to go over some of the breaking news and information
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.400]  dealing with all of this because there's big globalist meetings going on
[36:50.400 --> 36:54.680]  right now and back in the day in 2007 we would cover the BAMP Canada meetings
[36:54.680 --> 36:58.680]  we would cover SPP meetings we would have Jerome Corcyon and Ron Paul on and
[36:58.680 --> 37:03.720]  we would all battle it together and it'd be big news and we'd have Lou Dobbs on
[37:03.720 --> 37:10.320]  and he was battling it now now it world government so well-known and so
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.400]  admitted it's not even sexy now to talk about it it's like okay yeah we're going

[37:56.960 --> 38:02.440]  funny what scum we are it's all funny how they can get away with anything they
[38:02.440 --> 38:06.480]  want by the way well somebody just in case he's not listening go tell David
[38:06.480 --> 38:12.520]  Knight he's on a date after and the second segment I I forgot to go tell him
[38:12.520 --> 38:15.040]  earlier that I want him on today I forgot this morning I forgot earlier he
[38:15.040 --> 38:18.480]  probably knows they're probably listening but I want him to cover what he
[38:18.480 --> 38:22.120]  covered last night on the nightly news we did a two-hour live transmission last
[38:22.120 --> 38:26.360]  night that I hosted with the reporters great analysis you name it and we even
[38:26.360 --> 38:32.200]  had some guest that arrived some Obamacare supporters a little bit of
[38:32.200 --> 38:38.480]  satire at the end of the transmission that's pretty ridiculous and there is
[38:38.480 --> 38:46.480]  drudgereport.com breaking down some of the things that Obamacare is rolling
[38:46.480 --> 38:50.600]  out a Paul Joseph Watson article from MFallWars.com it's on the right-hand
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.840]  side Obamacare finds to be seized from bank accounts oh yeah that's why they
[38:55.840 --> 38:59.640]  always had the IRS running it that's actually in the bill and then Obama said
[38:59.640 --> 39:04.480]  well don't worry the IRS won't do that kind of like I'm against the NDAA
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.360]  secretly arresting Americans and I'm gonna fight it in the Senate and then
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.440]  Senator Dodd got the blame and he came out and goes here's the letter from
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.920]  Obama and his lawyers they wrote it they've pressured us to pass this and I
[39:17.920 --> 39:24.760]  feel betrayed we've played the clip here he goes I feel betrayed that you didn't
[39:24.760 --> 39:30.000]  want to be known to be behind this I did it and then you threw me under the bus
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.360]  he actually says this when you are the ones and mr. president I respect you
[39:35.360 --> 39:38.440]  you're my friend you know we're fellow mafia members he didn't say that but
[39:38.440 --> 39:43.440]  that's what he was saying why have you done this to me why you treat me so bad
[39:43.440 --> 39:48.880]  because that's what he does to his his string of girls his horse I mean the
[39:48.880 --> 39:53.240]  New World Order is all about breaking us all about trampling and being trampled
[39:53.240 --> 40:01.680]  all about betraying everyone that's sexy that's cool that's how gangster things
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.320]  operate in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia I've studied tyranny I study
[40:05.320 --> 40:10.720]  criminology tyranny are gangsters folks what you think gangsters are like the
[40:10.720 --> 40:15.640]  rap stars of today the wannabe gangsters you know now that term means black
[40:15.640 --> 40:21.240]  urban hip-hop person no no gangsters are people in gangs and they take over your
[40:21.240 --> 40:25.680]  government and they loot and take everything and they never stop until
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.520]  everything collapses and that's how they like it and then they sit up in big
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.200]  armored castles is everyone starving to death just partying down as your
[40:34.200 --> 40:40.600]  villages burn that's what they do that's what they're into and it's a you see
[40:40.600 --> 40:46.000]  Obama when he walks off stage I'll be high-flying Biden and laughing I mean they
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.400]  break down on record and laugh at everyone and their I mean vice presidents
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.400]  and presidents you better believe folks LBJ back in his day made billions of
[40:56.400 --> 40:59.400]  dollars that were put in different accounts it's come out and that was in
[40:59.400 --> 41:06.160]  1960s money a guy that came from out in Johnson City today out by Fredericksburg
[41:06.160 --> 41:14.760]  Texas in a dirt-flored cabin and he ended up with billions of dollars
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.720]  billions and billions of dollars when he died of course none of it meant anything
[41:18.720 --> 41:23.400]  at the end did it I talked to somebody that talked to talk to a family member
[41:23.400 --> 41:30.480]  of LBJ who talked to him about a week before he had his heart attack out of
[41:30.480 --> 41:33.200]  his ranch and he died in the air they tried to fly him to San Antonio they
[41:33.200 --> 41:39.800]  had an airfield out there who's former president and LBJ came in and visited he
[41:39.800 --> 41:43.840]  had long hair then he was totally depressed smoking a ton of pot and he
[41:43.840 --> 41:48.920]  said none of it meant anything you smoke in pockets his doctor told him smoke
[41:48.920 --> 41:51.560]  pot it'll make you not have a bunch of heart attacks which had been helping him
[41:51.560 --> 41:55.080]  you know settling him down because he was kind of got always jingled coins in
[41:55.080 --> 42:04.760]  his pocket and was always real out of control and he said I would I wish I
[42:04.760 --> 42:08.080]  had gone a different path I wish I could have never have done all this I mean
[42:08.080 --> 42:11.600]  he kind of makes you actually feel good for him and admiring him in a way that
[42:11.600 --> 42:16.960]  at the end he hated it all and felt bad and was so upset about all the dead in
[42:16.960 --> 42:22.000]  Vietnam at least he had a soul and felt horrible for what he'd done that is a
[42:22.000 --> 42:27.440]  good thing just like the thief next to Christ on the cross at the end says you
[42:27.440 --> 42:30.960]  know I repent I wish I wouldn't have done all these bad things Christ looked
[42:30.960 --> 42:36.360]  at him and said today he will be with me in paradise because he still had
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.960]  goodness in his heart but I think about all these people I mean Obama and the
[42:40.960 --> 42:46.600]  Bushes and the globalists of today are light years ahead of bad guys of old I
[42:46.600 --> 42:52.600]  mean they are really really really nasty Hitler was into darkness into the
[42:52.600 --> 42:57.000]  occult into really evil things a lot of sick stuff but he also thought he was
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.880]  saving the world and thought there was some great altruism at the end of it I
[43:00.880 --> 43:05.400]  studied Hitler as well Stalin was an outright former bank robber thug who
[43:05.400 --> 43:09.480]  just like to kill people and run everything and that's the kind of
[43:09.480 --> 43:14.680]  people we have now they just like to be nasty and hurt people and make sure
[43:14.680 --> 43:19.000]  everybody's poor they like seeing poor people they like seeing starving kids
[43:19.000 --> 43:24.280]  they like seeing society fall apart they like it it makes them feel good to do
[43:24.280 --> 43:28.640]  that to you they're threatened by you having a beautiful wife they're
[43:28.640 --> 43:31.640]  threatened by you having your own business they're threatened by you
[43:31.640 --> 43:35.320]  being straight and strong they've hated you their whole life because you're
[43:35.320 --> 43:41.240]  smart and successful they don't love humanity they hate humanity I'm in a
[43:41.240 --> 43:47.400]  love affair with humanity I love art literature I love people I love ideas I
[43:47.400 --> 43:51.440]  love I get frustrated because I can't implement all my plans which I know if
[43:51.440 --> 43:55.280]  I was had enough smarts or enough capital or enough whatever we could really
[43:55.280 --> 43:58.200]  change the world but you know we've already changed the world to a certain
[43:58.200 --> 44:01.800]  extent and we're just doing the best job we can and I know I'm ranting I want to
[44:01.800 --> 44:05.880]  talk about the number we're going to continue to track this with the latest
[44:05.880 --> 44:09.680]  updates because drudge is on it at drudgereport.com I've got my great crew
[44:09.680 --> 44:15.960]  at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com the Watson brothers and a Don Salazar and
[44:15.960 --> 44:22.400]  Kurt Nemo and Kit Daniels and of course Julie Wilson and the great reporters
[44:22.400 --> 44:28.040]  over there on the TV side we're all watching and waiting and tracking when
[44:28.040 --> 44:34.040]  the group of World War two veterans are set to arrive anytime I know there's
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.720]  all sorts of streetcams you can find try to look for DC streetcams on Ustreamer
[44:38.720 --> 44:45.960]  whatever I'll bet money there's people already Ustreaming down there at the at
[44:45.960 --> 44:51.360]  the mall down there in DC or up there in DC there at the Lincoln Memorial where
[44:51.360 --> 44:55.560]  this confrontation set to happen because they've now put up big fences and they've
[44:55.560 --> 45:01.480]  got the cops out there and I'll guarantee you I will guarantee you they're
[45:01.480 --> 45:07.240]  going to arrest them and and and I'm telling you folks this is the arrogance
[45:07.240 --> 45:10.200]  and this is what ends up defeating people the image of old people being beat
[45:10.200 --> 45:13.280]  up because if some of these vets try to get up out of their wheelchairs or
[45:13.280 --> 45:20.120]  whatever to go see their memorial I will guarantee you that the the police
[45:20.120 --> 45:24.600]  because this is a special thing to be able to hurt them will will attack them
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.600]  and and the reason is because it is so bold you would think of it as a as a PR
[45:29.600 --> 45:34.040]  disaster for them but if they can do this they can do anything they may be
[45:34.040 --> 45:39.360]  smart and back off because they threatened to arrest them before if they
[45:39.360 --> 45:44.520]  went to the World War two memorial that I paid for and you paid for I
[45:44.520 --> 45:51.560]  personally gave I remember this a thousand dollars to that memorial I want
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.960]  to say that guy that World War two vet he's come on the show he was a funny
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.200]  guy he was our Chicago affiliate and he was so interesting I had him on as a
[46:00.200 --> 46:04.000]  guest a few times about it Jen tell I wonder if he's even still alive most
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.560]  these vets are gone and he owned a Chicago affiliate a different one than
[46:07.560 --> 46:11.640]  we have today around a few years had a huge listening audience was a mom-and-pop
[46:11.640 --> 46:17.080]  and he was a like the head of for Illinois it's now coming back to me he
[46:17.080 --> 46:24.280]  was the head so look up the head of the Illinois World War two memorial fund he
[46:24.280 --> 46:29.280]  was the head of the Illinois deal and boy he was on that and I can't believe
[46:29.280 --> 46:33.000]  how much money they raised I forget well sure there's a Wikipedia page how much
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.440]  money they raised to build that giant memorial I've been to it it's a it's
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.480]  amazing and I had people walk up and tell me not to shoot video security guards
[46:41.480 --> 46:45.160]  I mean it's the same deal they're henpecking you to let you know that you
[46:45.160 --> 46:49.360]  are their slave and you better get in line and do what they say and so it
[46:49.360 --> 46:54.760]  makes it even crazier that that no securities needed there if there's a
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.640]  problem you call the police but you go to DC it's crawling with toilet
[46:59.640 --> 47:03.720]  attendant security guards who then will tell you you can't videotape here you
[47:03.720 --> 47:07.560]  go well there's no law they'll call the cops cops come and go listen you got to
[47:07.560 --> 47:10.640]  get a permit we go there are no permits we check they go it doesn't matter I've
[47:10.640 --> 47:13.800]  been told to tell you leave and I'll say you're really violating my first
[47:13.800 --> 47:16.640]  amendment a few times the cops go all right get out of here in five minutes and
[47:16.640 --> 47:20.240]  I won't give you a ticket or arrest you happen at the Supreme Court to him
[47:20.240 --> 47:24.240]  across the street and the federal guys we have this on video come over and say
[47:24.240 --> 47:28.520]  you can't videotape I go there's no law want a sidewalk I'm not on the federal
[47:28.520 --> 47:33.080]  property he goes listen buddy I'm gonna arrest you in about 30 seconds and I
[47:33.080 --> 47:38.080]  mean and I was charming I went come on I'm just getting this for a documentary
[47:38.080 --> 47:42.360]  you know they don't give permits he goes yeah they don't and I said can I just do
[47:42.360 --> 47:46.960]  it real quick he goes you got two minutes he goes you could even set up
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.000]  your tripod well that's the big thing I go thank you so much and I I sat there
[47:51.000 --> 47:58.200]  and pumped his ego as a psychological warfare test and he was he was more of
[47:58.200 --> 48:04.320]  the baby Huey Dudley do-right type and I've done these psychological warfare
[48:04.320 --> 48:07.760]  test with them you know do testing different things to see how they respond
[48:07.760 --> 48:12.000]  and you're sitting here looking at a total program person you feel sorry for
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.400]  them a predator that works for the New World Order would sit there and program
[48:15.400 --> 48:19.720]  them but they're literally programmable and I'm not knocking cops or security
[48:19.720 --> 48:25.400]  guards here it's like that across the board I mean how you can talk to the
[48:25.400 --> 48:32.640]  public you can talk to women whatever now and if you know the things to say
[48:32.640 --> 48:37.520]  it's just immediate it's like they're machines or something and I just am very
[48:37.520 --> 48:42.240]  sad about this I want to take your calls on this because this is really
[48:42.240 --> 48:46.200]  capturing people's imagination if the veterans force their way in that other
[48:46.200 --> 48:50.920]  people will force their way in and then the whole hoax is broken and they don't
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.560]  want that to happen that's why they may go the extra mile and go ahead and
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.880]  arrest the veterans even though they know it'll be a disaster they can't stop
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.240]  because the image just like in V for vendetta where the thousands and hundreds
[49:03.240 --> 49:07.200]  of thousands show up in the mask and the military decides to not fire on them
[49:07.200 --> 49:12.400]  and it's at that point Chalcescu falls to use the Romanian example what you see
[49:12.400 --> 49:17.360]  in V for vendetta that's fiction is actually based the Wachowski sister and
[49:17.360 --> 49:24.640]  brother have talked about of different things that happen in 1776 things that
[49:24.640 --> 49:27.820]  happen with Guy Fox things that happen other events and the Romanian
[49:27.820 --> 49:31.560]  revolution where the same thing happened the people marched on the Capitol and
[49:31.560 --> 49:36.400]  on Chalcescu the dictator the military was told to kill him and the
[49:36.400 --> 49:41.120]  military stood down and then all of a sudden the military said you know what
[49:41.120 --> 49:47.120]  let's just go take the palace let's just turn this around now in America we
[49:47.120 --> 49:49.720]  already have a Bill of Rights Constitution we don't need to do that I
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.800]  don't want the military by the way in some general to be our new president
[49:53.800 --> 49:59.320]  while they have elections and I know Stuart Rhodes is really against the
[49:59.320 --> 50:03.920]  military coup and I don't want it as well but there is a place someday if
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.240]  this continues to just not have the military stand out and then they bring
[50:07.240 --> 50:10.760]  in UN troops and it's an openly a foreign government I mean you will have
[50:10.760 --> 50:18.320]  to have the military at that point go in and arrest the so-called president and
[50:18.320 --> 50:24.800]  his cabinet so that the civil authority and arrest the attorney general and
[50:24.800 --> 50:32.440]  others and then have an emergency vote in the house probably the best way to do
[50:32.440 --> 50:36.080]  it on appointing an interim president I mean that's what you're gonna have to
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.280]  do here I mean I'm more and more I realize that they're not going anywhere
[50:39.280 --> 50:43.160]  they're gearing up for a protracted war with us and I can't believe we're on air
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.080]  actually having to talk about stuff like this I mean look if I cared about my
[50:48.080 --> 50:53.400]  just my my own butt my own rear end I would take my family and flee to Switzerland
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.360]  or northern Europe right now I mean you have to understand that this is this is
[50:57.360 --> 51:02.680]  not sensationalism folks this is happening I'm sick of how the big drug companies

[55:22.120 --> 55:28.560]  Park it doesn't run and that's the bombshell here because I was thinking
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.680]  even before this article came out wait a minute I don't think that's run by the
[55:32.680 --> 55:37.000]  government it's government property but it's a private trust that runs it and
[55:37.000 --> 55:45.120]  wasn't it private security when I was there told us not to film and and boom
[55:45.120 --> 55:51.280]  that's right folks they don't even run it haha and we tried to find webcams this
[55:51.280 --> 55:56.600]  is fact in fact this is newsworthy they've cut off the webcams this is an
[55:56.600 --> 56:00.400]  article we ought to do right here all over the country look at this national
[56:00.400 --> 56:06.240]  Park Service because of the federal government shutdown all national parks

[56:10.520 --> 56:16.920]  turn the websites off they had to do a bunch of work to do that taxpayer paid
[56:16.920 --> 56:23.680]  for material and work cultural work essays articles photos research kids
[56:23.680 --> 56:28.440]  games you name it all turned off oh but I was looking on their site guess what's

[56:34.040 --> 56:40.760]  coffee cups these people make me want to throw up they are running a giant stunt
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.600]  and putting up barricades everywhere even parks they don't run saying you can't
[56:44.600 --> 56:48.800]  come in a reminds me the Federal Reserve we're like a quarter mile away from the
[56:48.800 --> 56:55.360]  Federal Reserve and was a Kansas City an armed private federal security in black
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.200]  uniforms cover with guns until Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson in some video
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.000]  give us your IDs and leave or we're gonna arrest you and they're like we're

[57:16.080 --> 57:21.080]  had to admit that because what do you do an enemy you lie to an enemy and now
[57:21.080 --> 57:25.600]  the Barack Obama barricades as they're called Park Service says Obama ordered
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.120]  it oh yeah this is this is and imagine once they run our health care they're

[57:36.880 --> 57:40.720]  example if you're part of the combine then you get all the fringe benefits of

[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:14.200]  and don't guard it that's private security spending extra money more security
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:21.060]  than they had it Benghazi to keep world war two vets out it's despicable and it
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.520]  shows the stunts they're pulling and they've turned off all the webcams they
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.800]  turned off all the national parks websites going to work so there's a
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:33.480]  message that you can't go to them on purpose with the few services government
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:37.200]  gives and then treats you like crud when you're at a national park it's
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.000]  incredible how bad they treat you the run to the nice person occasionally and
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.400]  it's like a breath of fresh air I went to some national parks in England they
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:47.080]  were actually pretty nice it was like amazing or not be treated like dog meat
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:51.240]  or to be spied on and and this is the attitude of government they want control
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:57.680]  of you so that you think that you need them they're a mafia up on info wars

[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.640]  up claims he was threatened with driver's license being revoked federal
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.200]  tax lien on home well there's no claim about that I'm gonna have Watson add to
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.680]  this article it's up on drudgereport.com remember when they passed it three
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:18.200]  years ago the IRS is the enforcer they said oh don't worry we won't do that
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:25.040]  then they hired 3,000 and 5,000 and 7,000 people to administer this as they cut
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.000]  back the other people at the IRS because now it's just gonna be right out of your
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.880]  bank account and it's gonna be a $5,000 fine they're gonna pull out of your

[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.320]  bad it's going to be this is outrageous that this is going on and it shows why
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.160]  you don't want to be in a cashless society because it gives them total
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:50.160]  control it's a lot worse than Bank of America trying to take five bucks out
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:55.240]  remember a few years ago if you want to use your ATM your money see the money
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.200]  so worthless now you don't get any interest and you actually have to pay
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.960]  money to have an account in many places welcome to the New World Order also
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.400]  coming up Swiss Army war games economic collapse and refugee invasion of
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.080]  collapsing Europe our Pentagon's training for that while the globalists
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:16.520]  engineer it this is very very important out of that global crisis they intend
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:22.400]  to bring in the control now we're gonna get more into the shutdown the stunts
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.600]  that are happening the World War two vets that are set to storm the Lincoln
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.240]  Memorial next and we'll see if the Obamanoids do arrest them or assault
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:35.240]  them they may be smart enough to back off but we know they've put up barricades
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.480]  and are locking it down spending more money most of them are not being furloughed
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.880]  just federal employees who are never coming back in many cases it's already
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.080]  been happening because the computer is going in okay that's how works the taxes
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.600]  go up the government actually will start shrinking at some point this is how
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.680]  austerity works and then it'll all be blamed on those of us that you know
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:02.480]  don't accept the Obamacare now while we're looking at Syria while we're
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.440]  looking at the American Empire employed by design while we're looking at the
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:10.640]  government shutdown and Obamacare and all those nightmares unfolding and the
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:15.720]  government websites not working for Obamacare not because of a shutdown but
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:20.040]  because they never got them in place because of the bureaucracy while this
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.760]  is happening as I told you a few days ago globalism is expanding the
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:27.320]  trilateral Commission set up in the 70s by David Rockefeller it's a big to
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:33.400]  Brzezinski and others has the heads of state in Asia in Europe and in North
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:40.000]  America to create a trilateral or three-legged world and in that
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.840]  trilateral world they remove the national sovereignty to trade
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:50.520]  organizations just like they set up the euro as the original model in 1957 with
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:56.040]  the Treaty of Rome out of Bilderberg and that's all been declassified government
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:13:00.160]  is now below state governments don't even count but states as in states of the
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.120]  world Union they have a limited vote what is about a third of the vote versus
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.680]  the corporations just like we saw in BAMP Canada the documents 2007 they're in
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.040]  in game where in the meetings the corporations are running it and
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:15.520]  literally shutting down their competition literally that's what Dr.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.320]  Paul Roberts has an article out today on infowars.com former head of the
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:22.640]  Treasury Department and Policy saying it's another giveaway to private interest
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.760]  yes a direct tax a direct ripoff calling it socialism I saw socialism so bad
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.480]  folks it always gets taken over it always creates gangs and special interests
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.560]  that's why it doesn't work yes if you had computers handing it out that were
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.160]  programmed by angels who weren't bad then it might actually work but would
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.240]  create laziness side issue joining us with a snapshot report the full
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:49.120]  reports upon present planet TV we did like 20 minutes live last night on the
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:54.240]  nightly news David Knight I wanted you to focus in on this Pacific partnership
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.040]  and the agreements now with the North American Union and the EU this is so
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:04.480]  incredibly important because this is their 19th meeting this is global
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.120]  governance and their own words being established David Knight it's gone on for
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.880]  several years and I find it interesting there's a lot of groups that you might
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.440]  say are aligned with the left with the Democrats who are aware of this pretty
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.200]  much people on the right have been fighting Obamacare they're not even
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.760]  aware of this and yet there's common characteristics between both of these it
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.920]  really is a transfer you know we look at Obamacare there's not any health care in
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:29.320]  that as the Supreme Court said it's a tax but it's not really even a tax because
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.760]  the money is not going to the government it's a transfer I ought to call it Obama
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.800]  transfer it's a transfer of wealth from the public to these few corporations and
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.720]  as we talked about last night and as a Don Salazar had in his article last
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.760]  Friday he showed the profits going up over the last four years and eight
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:51.080]  biggest insurance companies gone up 200% 300 400 some of them 500% increase in
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.280]  profits they know where this is headed they knew that they were going to make a
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.160]  lot of money people are just now finding out what's in it as Pelosi said
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.480]  we're now seeing that our rates are going up by 200% or more companies are
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.480]  being shut down we have doctors going out of business we have other smaller
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.640]  insurance companies going out of business but these big insurance companies
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.120]  are making out like bandits and that's exactly what's happening gonna happen
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:17.720]  with this TPP they're meeting in secret you don't have senators going you don't
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.400]  have congressmen going they've given this fast trade fast-track trade
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.200]  authorization to Obama which means that he has something called the United
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.520]  States Trade Representative who's conducting all these these meetings
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.200]  and we've got to appear on the document camera right now this is the statement
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.240]  from September 9th at their last meeting was August 21st and he's
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:42.080]  addressing the stakeholders now they're not talking about the public they're not
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.360]  talking about congressmen they're talking about stakeholders that's the
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:49.040]  owners that's right the owners that's not you and me that's not the public it's
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:53.560]  not our government the stakeholders are these corporations and he's saying that
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.000]  well we had to make some difficult decisions not everybody's going to agree
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.480]  with everything but we wanted to keep you our stakeholders involved and I've
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:05.280]  got a 170 persist participants and those are their stakeholders now in some
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:10.640]  cases it goes up to maybe 600 lobbyists from these large corporations but you
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.320]  can't have the press cannot go in just like Bilderberg it's shut down you can't
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.800]  have the press go in senators can't get in Ron Wyden who is complained about the
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.000]  secrecy in the NSA has complained about the fact that they can't get in they
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  can't know what's in it some details have leaked out we know that they've got a
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  new court mechanism which is just like they've had it in NAFTA which is an
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.240]  investor state tribunal now what they've done is it's almost like they've taken
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:42.560]  the the Magna Carta and they've reversed it now to going back from a democracy
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.360]  you know that that basically started moving the power away from the king
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.040]  moved it out to a bunch of oligarchy but actually it established some basic
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:53.440]  rights for individuals now they're taking those rights from individuals are
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.600]  taking it back to the oligarchy and the oligarchy these these corporations are
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.080]  really taking everything over they've elevated themselves to the level of the
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:05.280]  state if they have a trade dispute if they say that some new regulation that
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.200]  they've put in let's say that they prohibit GMO that they allow GMO labeling
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.600]  and Monsanto says well that's a new law and according to our trade agreement
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.800]  so we had in the past you've now lowered our profit expectations so they can take
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:22.400]  that government to court not not actually to court to this tribunal where the
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.880]  company appoints one of the people the state the government appoints one person
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.400]  and then they both agree mutually on a third person and it supersedes national
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:37.760]  sovereignty this is direct global governance by the Fortune 500 yes in
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.040]  their own words yes David Rockefeller has said that and now they're almost there
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:48.640]  and Obamacare is the perfect example trillions of dollars over the next five
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:54.560]  years and total control directed to them and its attacks and I wish we could get
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.160]  both the left and the right to see what's going on Obamacare is the same
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:02.800]  thing as these trade partnerships the transatlantic the trans Pacific
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.040]  partnership the TPP they also have a transatlantic free trade agreement tafta
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.640]  like NAFTA that merges the EU with the North American Union yes and then they
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.640]  have agreements merging it with the Asian Union through the TPP this is what
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:21.600]  we covered in in game seven years ago but now it's here that's right
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.680]  Bilderberg they're looking in secret at their long-term strategic planning this
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:29.560]  is where they're hammering out the details this is where they're pushing
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:33.640]  the button this is where they're taking over our sovereignty just like the FISA
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:36.960]  court is meeting in secret nobody even knew that that by the way these groups
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.840]  have tried to get the international agreements to censor the internet through
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.920]  yes and that's one of the things I mean internet you got all these groups that
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:49.320]  were fighting Syspa Sopa Acta they came at them through copyright because that's
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.880]  what these corporations are about they're about asserting their ownership over
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.800]  everything turning everybody into renters whether it's really renting
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.840]  your house or whether it's renting intellectual property from them they
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:03.280]  want to turn everybody into renters they want to own everything but it also
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.600]  works out for the governments because the governments can then avoid all due
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.200]  process they can shut down anybody they want to by using a copyright claim so
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.920]  this is this partnership between the same thing with the vitamin code or codex
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:19.720]  element areas same people running that openly wanting to shut down everything
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.640]  all types of supplements they're not playing games and in closing Homeland
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.880]  Security is being set up in every nation as the system to suppress the people if
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.360]  they try to take their government back this is a corporate global coup d'etat
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:38.360]  absolutely you've got groups who opposed Sopa and Syspa now they see this is
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.120]  going to be brought in with the TPP they're getting involved and they're
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.000]  saying wait a minute that's not even trade that's just pure and the biggest
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.800]  you is people are now starting to wake up to this we're covering it you're

[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:54.480]  info and Clancy said part of the composite character of Jack Ryan Steve
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.840]  Pachennick's gonna pop in at the bottom of the next hour about 1015 minutes give
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.480]  us his take on that but also what he thinks happened in the naval yard
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.960]  shooting he's been wanting to get on about that I want to hear his take on it
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.960]  I don't know what it is yet and he keeps calling for a revolution just saying no
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.560]  to the tyranny I think he's gonna be excited about these World War two vets
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.440]  crossing the line at these national parks and also World World War two
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:21.360]  Memorial that the government it turns out didn't pay for and doesn't run that's
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:29.680]  now come out in the Washington Examiner in a story about how I got several
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.880]  articles here on it in a story about how there's more security there than it
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:39.480]  been at Benghazi and on top of it there they're putting more park service
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:43.680]  people out because obviously there's no real shutdown ladies and gentlemen kind
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.640]  of like for several months they said there was no debt increase going on to
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:52.680]  get around the national debt limit when Congress wouldn't pass a debt increase
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:57.160]  they just said oh well there's no longer a debt increase anymore they just do
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.040]  whatever they want they run the drugs they the government runs everything
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:05.400]  folks on record it's a criminal mafia you got a light side you've got a dark
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.360]  side so we're gonna be breaking that down to and get Dr. Steve Pachennick's
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:13.760]  take on that in a brief comment on the passing of Tom Clancy that's being
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.440]  reported they don't know how he died seeing reports other Tom Clancy whose
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:21.680]  novel the hunt for red October propelled him to fame and fortune and status as a
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:24.920]  favorite storyteller the American military has died according to sources
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:30.560]  with the publisher and family he was 66 and that guy looked old back in the 80s
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.840]  when he was Reagan's favorite writer and when I'd see him on like layer news hour
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:41.720]  and stuff so 66 shows what cigarettes will do to you folks age you fast let's
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:48.680]  go to Tosh Plumling who by the way flew guns to Fidel Castro when he was a CIA
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:55.560]  guy in 1959 and or I guess earlier that came out in the famous hearings in the
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.760]  church hearings and then he was also in the Iran contra hearings I won't go over
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.880]  his whole bio again but Tosh Plumling did you get any heat for coming on last
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.800]  week and talking about your high-level NATO source breaking down what really
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.520]  happened it in Benghazi sir
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:20.800]  well thank you Alex yeah well I would call that he has been warned a little bit
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:25.680]  not to do this not to go back on there wouldn't be healthy so to speak but
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.320]  that's happened quite a lot of these times we might like this for years to
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:36.280]  call it so it's nothing to worry about I mean these things happen well I asked
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:39.520]  the question how are you currently doing clandestine operations I guess you're
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:44.880]  not talking about those and so you can still keep as a civilian the job you
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.360]  have because you've been in the system so long is there anybody else like you
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.160]  that was flying guns around the world in the late 1950s who's still out there
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.880]  doing it well there's a lot of like I said last week I believe there's a lot
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:03.360]  of people like me they're tied in with private contractors some of them are
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:09.560]  labeled as mercenaries there's not that many as old as I am it just wants to
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:16.280]  act it but the operation the way it's been for a number of years is still
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:22.640]  ongoing in one form or another I mean it's you know periodically the operation
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.920]  that's taken off the shelf does it all week a little bit here and there and
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:36.520]  then put back in my association I got out of it for a few years got drawn back
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:42.440]  into it people that I associated with in the Mexico Bank going back to
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:48.560]  Camarena when he was in Guadalajara some of those opposite some of those pilots
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.920]  some of the deep deep undercover guys that were involved in operations
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:59.320]  penetrates have stayed engaged in one form or another they've been asked to go
[01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:04.440]  back on the cover with boots on the ground inside Mexico to train Mexican
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:11.520]  troops military type operation well it was written about 209 to 210 by an
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:19.880]  orco news so these contacts that I have or what's wrong brings me back in so to
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.920]  speak as far as being a sanctioned government operator assigned to a
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:30.160]  particular operation so that doesn't happen anymore with me my
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:36.920]  information comes from deep contact that I lose associated with traveled with
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.840]  so like that I understand Tasha I've got a lot of contacts in 18 years I know how
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.040]  that works years go back 60 years it's amazing we're gonna come right back to

[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:23.280]  silver is a new patented technology that is made using 10,000 volts of AC current
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:28.480]  this technology is so powerful it must be made in a laboratory colloidal and
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.400]  ionic silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current making super
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.960]  natural silver hundreds of times more effective against viruses bacteria and

[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.040]  ceiling must mean that we're running up our debt raising the debt ceiling which
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:22.200]  has done been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt it does not
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:27.520]  somehow promote profligacy all it does is it says you gotta pay the bills that

[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.560]  nightly news sometime with an expanded show for like 45 minutes commercial free
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.680]  you know during the period he's on to really be able to just break down the
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.400]  whole history of flying guns for the CIA to Fidel Castro that came out in
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.640]  Congress and what a treasure trove of knowledge but in the time we have with
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:19.440]  him here he's pointed out that it's not his site but it pertains to him and what
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.920]  came out in Congress some of it still classified Tosh Plumlee.info and we'll
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:30.360]  put that site up on screen for TV viewers Tosh Plumlee.info you can find a
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.640]  lot of stuff there Tosh I want to just do this I'm gonna shut up or I'll
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:38.760]  interject my points and ask my questions and divert you you've gone on a limb to
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:45.040]  tell us about your high-level NATO source and the fact that they said that
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:50.000]  look this was under the Arms Import Act by the State Department that they used
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.960]  to arm people legally but they use it to arm terrorists illegally because it
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:58.880]  violates the federal law to arm terrorists but they used a legal program to
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:03.000]  transfer them and you notice Obama then signed an order three weeks ago saying
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.680]  they can now arm terrorists but that's retroactive to cover to cover their
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:11.160]  behind and that you had other sources that confirm with the NATO high-level
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:15.560]  officer told you that this was pretty much just to recap what you said a hit
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.280]  on Ambassador Stevens and others because they were sending cables back saying we
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.920]  don't want to give these stinger missiles not not just stuff they got from
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.600]  Qaddafi French missiles and others but that it was actually an arms transfer
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.640]  with the ambassador from Turkey as well it was supposed to take him back up to
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.240]  al-Qaeda and other extremists in Syria and that the ambassador left got upset
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.280]  this is the same intel I was given by the way we're already on record saying this
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.080]  from our sources but this is what they were told you talked to a source in
[01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.280]  NATO who could confirm it and then others that did and that it was an actual hit
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:53.880]  and then it wasn't living in arms that was being transferred it was directly
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:58.280]  from the State Department and so recapping your own words what you said
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:02.680]  last week and the fact that no media picked it up by the way and Fox News
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.360]  contacted us we have that email on their number so so if you want that Tosh will
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.960]  give you that if you want to talk to Fox News you may have already talked to him
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:16.640]  but I wanted to talk to you before you know we gave him your number so you've
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.720]  got the floor for 10 minutes to get out whatever you think is most important
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:26.720]  for people to know and to recap exactly what your NATO source said okay I try to
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:31.760]  come up this way and make it as brief as possible the possible can yes I have
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:35.480]  talked to Fox News in fact I was interviewed by them six or yesterday
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:41.360]  sooner or sometime next week mainly and this was mainly in reference to Carl
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:48.640]  Quintero and the CIA training base training Guatemalan guerrillas and C-130
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:53.800]  flying arms down into that area right after the southern in front of our
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.200]  unconscious setup now the reason I brought this up maybe I can tie it in
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:04.440]  some of my sensitive sources were involved in that operation back in 1885
[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:09.160]  also those guys some of them have retired however the lineage that those
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:14.000]  contacts of those undercover officers may which was actually around the time of
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:21.280]  Tito Camarino's assassination they have also come up into the Mexico
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:28.920]  operation and a boost on the ground inside Mexico training the Mexican
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:36.240]  marinos and drug interdiction programs and that one of the commanders a high
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.080]  ranking military official out of the Pentagon was sort of in charge of that
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:47.440]  operation and he got transferred over to Afghanistan a couple years ago after he
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:54.240]  had completed the Amphibs operations in Mexico City in the Mexico area all right
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:01.560]  one of the NATO source and inspector had made contact with his team and told him
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:08.320]  a fascinating story about they had uncovered US-made weapons from in
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:15.560]  safe houses in Jordan and Turkey but my source started and his team started
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:20.520]  investigating that there was a look again another leak about that that it
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:26.440]  started to come out I was contacted by two sources the NATO investigators to
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:32.720]  confirm what my friend from the Mexico operation had told me also what was
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:43.080]  going on inside Jordan Turkey Pakistan and Gunner and these were safe houses
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:48.440]  that had US-made weapons stashed in them allegedly at that point in time
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:55.320]  controlled by the CIA a faction within the CIA an operation and those weapons
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:39:02.000]  were being dispersed to different factions within the Syrian rebel army or
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.520]  whatever was at that point in time trying to be formed the bombshell about
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:15.160]  that was in order to protect that crew and the information that was coming out
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:24.280]  through Middle Eastern channels it was very important that this crew be
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:29.200]  protected so the best way to protect them was the someone like me which I had
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.000]  done with the Amtrak operation in Mexico there's the contact sources of mine and
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:40.680]  tell them this story simply that US weapons were in safe houses being
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:47.680]  transferred to Syrian rebels and the ambassador one of the leaks that this
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:54.160]  group was concerned about and became privy to that information and he had sent
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:59.320]  a series of dispatches back to the State Department and I thanked also the DOJ
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:05.800]  about the allegations that military people inside the Middle East and
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:10.560]  Afghanistan were saying that they had been running across US-made military
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.600]  weapons and was trying to figure out where they were coming from well the
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:23.120]  safe houses later were exposed and batches were found by investigators in
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:29.320]  that area and that was also reported to the ambassador the ambassador found out
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:34.360]  about seeing a missile being in these safe houses in Jordan he reported that
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:39.480]  back to the State Department State Department reduced to make that public
[01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:44.000]  business investigator I don't know my face was finished at the center but I'm
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:50.320]  just congrats Lee and I thought the that was investigating that time the
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:56.800]  passenger's operation also at that particular time weapons had been found
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.960]  inside Mexico US-made high-impact weapons I had already previously
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.440]  photographed those weapons but staging areas inside Mexico that's another part
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.920]  of this story so at that point in time the ambassador his crew started their
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:18.760]  own investigation into the allegations that came from the NATO inspector and
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:25.480]  also the high-ranking military of the Pentagon officer that was in charge of
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:31.280]  launching that particular investigation trying to find out where those
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.800]  weapons were coming from and who had authorized their ship in the process of
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:43.760]  his investigation he found the fuel receipt flight plans of the C-130 they
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:48.920]  came direct from American soil in certain places cut-out places and also
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:54.480]  civilian contract aircraft that had been transporting those weapons to Jordan
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:01.600]  and cut-out companies and well not companies cut-out countries and into
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:11.520]  these CIA safe houses or the CIA cut-out companies by the contractors that were
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:15.880]  running these safe houses and was responsible for sending those weapons
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:23.000]  to allegedly the Turing Rebels Turing Rebels at that particular time had been
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.640]  fractured into many different glitter groups and those some of those glitter
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:34.280]  groups had been filtering and actually given those weapons to be used again
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:40.520]  and also it was reported by that source those weapons were found at the crime
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:46.280]  scene when the ambassador in his crew was killed or murdered in my opinion I
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:51.640]  don't know that follow that lenient that sort of the lenient basically
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:57.280]  summing it up a source that had worked the Mexico operation train the marinos in
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:03.680]  Mexico transferred to Afghanistan got with the NATO inspection team found out
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:08.840]  about this information the information was passed to the ambassador the
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.800]  ambassador made a series of reports to the state department the state
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:17.880]  department refused and actually told them to stand down there was no
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:24.080]  investigation launched that was a year but well few months before the attack on
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:29.920]  the embassy and so my sources two sources three sources actually in the
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:36.160]  Middle East says that the ambassador and his team was eliminated so that these
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:39.720]  weapons shipments from the direct commercial sales program which is a
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:46.720]  legal operation would not be exposed and it would not be exposed that the
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:53.320]  fair factions within the Turing Rebels were receiving armed from that program
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:44:01.600]  sponsored by elements action within the CIA these were not roles that CIA has an
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:06.800]  operation within the CIA that the mainstream of CIA does not even know
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:14.960]  it's there and that's been going on in my career ever since 1956-57 and one form
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:21.280]  or another like I said taken off the shelf dust it off a little bit
[01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:28.080]  read that we do retrofitted the fit in the modern whatever the politics of the
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:34.280]  five well sure I mean there's all sorts of criminal groups and smaller
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:39.000]  operations and different sectors and different agencies and have splinter
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.120]  groups within other agencies and it's all basically very busy in team and a
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.600]  lot of this as you know as you were part of the testimony in Congress has come
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:54.040]  out over the years and it's not just black projects they're secret projects
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:00.200]  within projects and an example of that is they supposedly set up the Delta force
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:05.600]  in the late 1970s but there are all sorts of groups in the army above even
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.320]  people that are officially in the army and there aren't even really contractors
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:15.400]  from what I've been told and what I've seen it's just completely secret armies
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.840]  that's right you know when I'm saying
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.040]  splinter groups factions these are not world operations these operations are actually
[01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:28.120]  controlled by the Pentagon with White House dollars have been all the time in
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:33.560]  fact when people to say there's a secret army out there there's a secret
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  government so like that to some extent that is absolutely right there is this
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:42.960]  operation within our own government that elements within our government and
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:48.040]  our Congress house and Senate and all these idiots back there my opinion but
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:54.040]  that's another story in itself they it's just it's so complicated and
[01:45:54.040 --> 01:46:00.400]  complicated and compartmentalized so that good investigators doing legwork
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:06.000]  get so muddled down you can't untangle it and try and the process kind of
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000]  hanging you become known as a conspiracy free and that's designed in order to
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.400]  cover and shield those operations and stop the exposure from that I'm no way
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:21.560]  against my government this is an actual thing that's going on within my government
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:28.160]  well people like me the only way we get protected there Alex is going on the
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:32.520]  record before the fact I've got a lot of friends that are no longer with us
[01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:36.960]  because they didn't go out and talk to different people and by the way Josh
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:42.040]  Josh Plumley's our guest famous whistleblower from the church hearings in
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.800]  the Iran Contra hearings and still a contractor or you could say a mercenary
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:52.640]  with just amazing contacts out there and 76 years old was part of the CIA
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.360]  operation to first arm Castro then to fight Castro all that came out in
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:01.320]  Congress simply amazing and a treasure trove I'd like to invite you whenever
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.320]  you like this week next week whenever to come on for a full 30 40 minutes of the
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:10.000]  nightly news to really just cover history and get it on record but people
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.760]  could take a lesson from what you've said here today sir and that's that being
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:19.080]  in the sunshine is what protects you people think countering the tyranny is
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.400]  what protects them it's the opposite we all need to get out in the sunshine just
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:27.920]  like Jim Garrison said that's where we have protection evil is defeated by
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:33.480]  being fought and and a free people will aggressively defend their liberty a
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:40.400]  slave people will bow to the system go ahead okay the one reason I can come out
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:45.320]  as I am not a government agent I am not for it I'm for it by the government I
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:48.840]  do not receive a paycheck for them the fact I don't receive any money at all
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:55.320]  and I'll make a point of that I was the reason that I'm that I'm talking is not
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:00.440]  really to expose anything but to get get the dogs of war off my butt if they
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.040]  want to come out and start gunning for me I mean they can do that anyway I've
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:08.400]  already been warned that basically shut up because I'm getting too close by

[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:36.520]  people refusing not to bow to the little socialist park rangers the anti-human
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:40.520]  eugenicists I'm telling you most of them are in pecking at them spending all
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:43.720]  this money putting up fences at the World War two memorial that they don't
[02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:47.240]  even run it's now come out what is your take on that we're talking to John and
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:52.480]  Maryland John was discussing his friends that have been cut to part time
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.880]  under under rape care under fraud care under shut down the economy care under
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:02.160]  kill the American economy care under cloward and piven care that's the
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:06.400]  sociological plan to bankrupt countries into socialism by overloading the
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:10.520]  welfare system and all these idiots that don't yeah they're not idiots they've
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:16.480]  been raised domesticated and they really think Obama wants to help them with the
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.680]  forced abortions and not just in China but in Africa now and they're like well
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:23.040]  there are too many black people I've had black folks tell me that I'm just like
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:27.080]  but I mean so it's okay to kill black people but if I don't want to turn my
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:31.400]  guns and I'm racist that's right it's just all like feeling like you're a

[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:17.400]  little piece last night in the two-hour live live Info Wars Nightly News we had
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:23.040]  a two-hour show last night with the crew and they brought in a gore mask that's
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.280]  the alien that fights Captain Kirk back in the 1960s famous episode with the
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:32.240]  ridiculous fight that's so fake that it's comedy genius we had joked around
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.680]  because there's a volcano outside also an old volcano that looks like the same
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.280]  landscape is that famous fight and it's an extinct volcano and I joked we get a
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:43.840]  captain Kirk outfit and then I would fight Rob do who's a bigger guy like
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:47.880]  six foot four or whatever and we do a fake fight as me as a potbellied Captain
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:51.480]  Kirk I never got around to it I like to do some humor it's fun people say why
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:54.800]  don't you be more serious but people love it I gotta have a little fun or I go
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:59.880]  crazy folks I'm a very serious person I need the humor I need to have fun with
[02:10:59.880 --> 02:11:05.720]  this stuff or I couldn't do it and so we're going to fight gore soon well I
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:11.760]  mean we we have the full gore outfit and we're going to go out and do it now

[02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:05.320]  that's their tax but if you're the lucky house they ask for your kid or
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:10.240]  sometimes as an exercise of power they would ask for the Lord or King and then
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:17.400]  burn them at the stake anyways it's all fun it's all liberal it's all trendy so

[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:36.160]  blew the whistle in San Antonio we got them from a W.O.A.I. investigation where
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:41.200]  they broke this about seven years ago and right at 67 percent of foster kids
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.800]  nationwide are on drugs and the average is on seven and the doctors were
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:49.280]  describing healthy five-year-old kids and stuff and three-year-olds who would cry
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:52.760]  for mommy so they drug them then they would be bad so they drug them more
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:57.200]  until they would actually have seizures bite their tongues off and then just die
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:04.800]  so it's very liberal well I appreciate your call sir thank you so much I mean
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:11.640]  come on kids you know mass murder pills are fun I mean you know I mean it says
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:14.600]  on the insert it'll make you go megalomaniac it'll make you kill people
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:18.600]  it'll make you kill yourself they started death education in 1990 in public
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:23.280]  schools and since then the suicide rates tripled so they expanded it more
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:28.640]  suicide training more pills more death more murder it makes perfect sense
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.160]  because they love eyes oh they're good people the government's only killed
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:37.680]  hundreds of millions of people the last century it's only the number one threat
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:44.600]  so it's extremists not to love it remember kids take the pros I can see
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:50.040]  pretty colors let's go ahead and talk to Debbie in Texas Debbie you're on the
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:54.640]  year hi Alex how are you today no I'm pretty good I had a psychotic break a
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.520]  long time ago never came back I know what you mean well I just want to let
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:03.320]  you know that my husband's been receiving a pension from the United
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:07.720]  States government for 14 years and every month you know I call the check on it
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:12.480]  and it says United States government but as of October 1st when I call to see if
[02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:17.520]  it had been deposited it was classified as a tax refund now I just want to know
[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:21.960]  are they gonna start confiscating things as a pretense of a tax refund for
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:28.320]  Obamacare ma'am 100% this has been done in Europe it's been done in Asia it's
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:30.880]  been done in Latin America they the reason we know exactly what they'll do
[02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:36.000]  is they're following a blueprint and yes they they they've already started
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:39.160]  taking the pension funds in Europe and the private bank accounts in Europe just
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:44.040]  across the board 30 40 50% depending on the country they've already done it in
[02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:48.200]  Iceland they said no and reverse it and arrested the government we do the same
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:54.920]  thing here and yes ma'am listen here's the deal they want to destroy the system
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:58.440]  it's not that we even spent too much the truth is an industrial society we
[02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:01.440]  should all be working two days a week and be fabulously rich that I mean the
[02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:05.760]  actuaries are all out there they call that an overheating economy though they
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:10.360]  want a post-industrial economy and yes ma'am if they can get away with it they
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:16.440]  plan on nationalizing the private pensions and then taxing them and then
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:23.200]  over a period of time cutting them down to a shadow of what they were well by
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:26.480]  the time you you know you pay for your health care there won't be any pension
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:33.960]  land you know but I'm I'm I would like to know if anyone calls in if anyone is
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:38.800]  a social security check you know recipient if that's been reclassified on
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:42.800]  their direct deposit hey listen starting two years ago we never even did a
[02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:46.960]  report on this we ship a lot of postage you know worldwide do you know what the
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:52.440]  USPS the US Postal Service what you now pay in internationally what they convert
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:59.400]  our dollars over to it's not euros guess what they convert it to SDRs SDRs
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:03.760]  strategic drawing rights we're already under global government it's already
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:08.240]  unlimited the bankers run everything they have unlimited money and they use it
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.960]  as a weapon to crush us the power to tax is the power to destroy and two years
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:17.960]  ago was actually three years ago they started saying SDRs and we call them
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:20.960]  they go we don't know what that is so they called their bosses and we checked
[02:19:20.960 --> 02:19:26.600]  online it's under SDRs yeah there it is US Postal Service starts quoting SDRs to
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:31.640]  dollar conversion rates and IMF endorses replacing dollars with SDRs yeah
[02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:38.560]  there it is started in 2009 yeah three years ago or four years ago meanwhile the

[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:40.840]  Piccinic pop in he knew co-wrote books with Tom Clancy who reportedly died
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:48.720]  the day at 66 a lot Tom Clancy was 66 when I was a kid anyways the point is he
[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:52.320]  looked like he was 66 when he was five years old I'm sad he's dead it's just I
[02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:57.260]  didn't know he was only 66 now that's coming up but right now let's go back
[02:24:57.260 --> 02:25:02.760]  to your phone calls Jeremy in Texas you're on the air go ahead Alex hey
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.400]  how's it going I just want to say right now you have the people's respect what
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:12.000]  you're doing is outstanding I thank you personally for putting
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:17.560]  everything on the line no need does that mean brother well I work actually at the
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:21.280]  courthouse what was which was just mentioned earlier about the whole
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:26.920]  malpractice thing my biggest thing though is people here just don't want to
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:30.160]  believe it they don't believe so I put your show on from time to time and just
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:36.080]  watch their eyeballs pop right open now my biggest thing is the question why is
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:42.040]  this really down to some old bloodline really trying to keep the wealth within
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:48.040]  and these people are just crazy or I mean is this really down to the fact of the
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:52.680]  the petrol dollar where nobody's accepting us because our country is flat
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:57.080]  broke well oligarchs have always interbred with each other and we call
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:01.800]  that royalty and then they tend to become mentally ill even more so from the
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:06.080]  interbreeding that happens with any species especially mammals so they're
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:09.520]  already aggressive and psychopathic have genetic traits that tend towards that
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:12.920]  then you interbreed elites throughout history I don't care whether it's in
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:18.000]  Africa or Asia or Europe or anywhere they become criminally insane and they
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:25.960]  adopted in the 1850s Darwinism and social Darwinism and then eugenics which
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:29.480]  is a system of dumbing us down not trying to build better people that's
[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:34.360]  public eugenics and that's bad enough and Hitler was just an offshoot of them
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.960]  and yes they want to control the future they don't want all these better
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:42.600]  energy systems and free energy systems that are being developed to be deployed
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:47.600]  they do everything they can to try to create a dark age for us and a new
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:56.160]  technological Valhalla for themselves an osgard a literal Mount Olympus I mean
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:59.360]  that's how they all describe it I saw some comment on YouTube going where is
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:03.280]  this that Google wants to be the mind of God where is this is this that Google
[02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:07.960]  says they they've got to create a system so you can live forever where is it well
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.920]  I don't know how stupid you are I show the articles on air but every time I
[02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:16.280]  mentioned something I don't show it if you can't find that using the NSA
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:21.280]  interface then I can't help you and of course the NSA interface is Google you
[02:27:21.280 --> 02:27:25.200]  get limited answers it gets all the answers tracking everybody you type in
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:29.960]  head of Google says they're going into healthcare plan to let people live
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:35.760]  forever it comes up AP Reuters wired magazine you type in CIA director says
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.560]  your dishwasher is watching and listening to you wired magazine associated
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.960]  press I mean I'm kind of going off the deep end here one of my pet peeves if you
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:48.400]  could would you like to live forever Google thinks you might that's out of
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.520]  what is that a Wall Street Journal that's out of the entrepreneur but there
[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:58.960]  there you go ladies and gentlemen and I just see this ignorance people still
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:02.560]  think I'm making it up that they're crossing plants and animals and animals
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:07.440]  and insects and then putting it in corn crops they all you can't do that you
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:13.640]  are and it's so frustrating to try to convince people who are like living in
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:20.000]  1975 of what's going on when it's all admitted but here's the deal the elite
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.400]  themselves are smart but they're not going to be able to manage all this you
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:27.760]  know some of the good news is they're trying to kick Bill Gates off the board
[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:32.840]  of Microsoft right now that's a good idea Bill Gates is a demon but that's a
[02:28:32.840 --> 02:28:39.040]  side issue do you want to say anything else sir no I just what just puzzled me
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:43.520]  is that how this can't go into a positive direction we can make a difference
[02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:47.320]  with this if we do and you continue to spread the message we awaken people we
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:51.920]  grab their interest somehow put this message into something that gathers
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:55.440]  their attention like they are doing in the negative ways we can make this into
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:01.960]  something positive but I agree we have to fight info wars and promote this the
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:07.400]  culture of liberty as the answer as a solution to the 1984 culture of tyranny
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:14.320]  and we have to promote a pro-human positive uplifting message versus
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.960]  their humans are ugly we're bad we're done for message and point out that
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:22.720]  these are people that want to sabotage human potential because it threatens
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:26.960]  their monopoly they are the enemy we're gonna have space colonies we're gonna
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:30.680]  have life extension God's gonna give it all to us they've paid the churches off
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.280]  to say it's the end of the world so we all think the ballgame's over it's not
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:39.720]  over God has incredible things in store for us everybody in Nazi Germany thought
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:44.000]  it was the end of the world people when when Titus sacked Jerusalem they thought

[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.360]  set on record that part of the composite of the Jack Ryan character is Steve
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:17.000]  Pachennick Steve Pachennick.com he's only with us for about 10 minutes we'll get
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.360]  him on next week for a full hour if he can do it talk about everything that's
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:25.960]  happening in the world but Tom Clancy reportedly died today they still have it
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:30.360]  said why he died the author of the sum of all fears the hunt for red October
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:35.400]  Patriot Games Rainbow Six Ghost Recon Splinter Cell a franchise worth
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:39.400]  billions and Steve Pachennick knew him for a long time and was his friend Steve
[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:46.760]  the passing of a great author. He was a great author a great friend and a great
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:53.120]  American he loved America and he is really the personification of the
[02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:57.160]  Americans he tries to aspire to be something more than he is most people
[02:35:57.160 --> 02:36:01.480]  don't realize that when we first met about 20 30 years ago he had written a
[02:36:01.480 --> 02:36:05.760]  phenomenal novel that became a bestseller but at this time it hadn't been
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:09.440]  it was called the hunt for red October and what people didn't realize at the time is
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:14.600]  that he had been an insurance salesman on just a big day and when I read it and I
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:20.480]  was introducing him I had mistaken with all my experience in the Soviet Union in
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:24.440]  the military I had thought whoever wrote the hunt for red October was this
[02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:28.920]  brilliant Soviet expert who's been a submarine commander and then when I met
[02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:35.040]  him and he and I sat down and we had lunch our first lunch for 20 30 years he
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:38.800]  told me he was an insurance salesman and he really acquired information but just
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:44.920]  asking his clients and I was just and we developed a strong friendship and then
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:50.040]  we developed he and I developed the books that then became famous Tom Clancy
[02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:54.720]  Top Center Netforce and he was part of the TV shows as well he was an
[02:36:54.720 --> 02:36:59.120]  incredibly humble man very funny I mean one of the things that people don't
[02:36:59.120 --> 02:37:03.320]  realize and I'm proud to say on the Alex Jones show he was a real patriot he
[02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.640]  cared a lot for America he would have served if he could have but unfortunately
[02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:13.440]  had a very bad eyesight and but he knew more about military strategy and
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:19.200]  tactics than any two generals that I knew of and he was a very humble man if
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:23.560]  you told him about you know how great a writer you were whatever it was he would
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:27.560]  put it down he'd say you know that's enough talk and you know I would watch
[02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:31.160]  and he and I would work for hours together and the people would say God you
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:36.040]  know it's so easy to write and he would tell you no it's very hard work he had
[02:37:36.040 --> 02:37:40.800]  no pretense to bad himself as a great writer he said look I know America I
[02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:46.560]  know my readers and I write for my readers and in one case I remember
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.040]  very well we were out in Hollywood and I was having a very hard time putting the
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.280]  show together and he and I worked together on the TV scripts we were
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:58.680]  actually wrote one of the first scripts on the internet on the computer I think
[02:37:58.680 --> 02:38:03.640]  was Apple at the time and 20 30 years ago and and he wrote a brilliant script
[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:07.080]  with me and then when we went out and I don't want to mention the man's name and
[02:38:07.080 --> 02:38:12.360]  he pitched a story that Tom had come up with about the White House and stories
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:16.000]  that occurred in the White House and this individual who's still there in
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:21.840]  Hollywood and his senior deputy that's Tom no that's not a good idea I think
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.800]  that's really quite terrible and but no listen the stories about the White House
[02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:32.080]  I think will be great stories and what goes on internally and the suit I just
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:37.040]  call him the suit although he's a senior executive still there Tom said look I
[02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:40.600]  may not be the greatest American author in the world but I certainly know the
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.920]  American audience better than anyone and I predict that stories about the White
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:50.000]  House internally on a TV show will do extremely well well meet us this day we
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  would turn down and I turned down afterwards and I said welcome to
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.160]  Hollywood this is the problem we have of course a year later wrestling became
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:02.920]  the dominant show I'm not sure it came out of our pilot but it was very close
[02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:08.800]  to it and Tom had an uncanny sense of what the American audience needed and
[02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:15.280]  wanted and and I give him full credit for understanding where our strategy and
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:19.360]  tactics in our military was going he was a great friend of the military he
[02:39:19.360 --> 02:39:23.880]  donated a lot of time and effort to our military and also a great friend to
[02:39:23.880 --> 02:39:28.480]  those in need so he will be sadly there and I certainly will miss him as a
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:34.680]  friend and and a collaborator and we developed about 20 30 books together and
[02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:40.320]  it was fun it was fun and it was tough and nothing came easily but I think his
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:44.680]  story should be an inspiration for all Americans whoever you are wherever you
[02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:49.080]  are an insurance salesman who was working as an insurance salesman and
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:53.960]  writes on the side and is not necessarily encouraged to write becomes one of the
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.320]  world's most famous writers and I think that's the inspiration that you really
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:04.640]  get from Tom Clancy and I never forgot it because he was always an inspiration
[02:40:04.640 --> 02:40:08.960]  for me he was an inspiration for young authors and other authors unlike many
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:14.760]  writers he was very happy for us to meet other writers like Forsyth and many
[02:40:14.760 --> 02:40:19.040]  many other writers and he was very generous with his time what he could not
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:25.240]  tolerate was the pretense of a literary world or a world that had ideological
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:29.880]  pretense to it I'm not saying that's those liberals who have swing but if a
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:35.080]  reporter would say they have you know you you're releasing secrets to terrorists
[02:40:35.080 --> 02:40:40.080]  he would sarcastically respond I don't remember Osama bin Laden writing me any
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:46.440]  letters for Al-Qaeda reading my books and much of his success was really do it
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:51.160]  in large part through a woman who was the publisher at Berkeley Potnum named
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:56.800]  Ellis Grant who really should receive a lot of the credit for having taken the
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:01.640]  initiative to publish him and really take him to the forefront of literature and
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:06.640]  this is the case where a publishing company really did work in close ties
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:12.120]  with Tom, myself, Berkeley Potnum and then eventually some of the books remain
[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:16.000]  with Berkeley Potnum and some of them went with me to St. Martin's where a new
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.040]  book will come out called out of the ashes and for years Tom and I would talk
[02:41:20.040 --> 02:41:24.120]  about what happened to the Christians in the Middle East because he and I were
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:27.960]  concerned I mean many people talk about Jews in the Middle East and the
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:32.440]  problems but Tom and I for years had been talking about the real issue is the
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:36.480]  copy Christians the Christians who are being slaughtered in the crossfire between
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:41.000]  Sunnis and Shiites and for years we talked about a book that we should write
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.960]  concerning the fate of the Christians in the Middle East and almost 15-20 years
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:52.680]  ago in his question and way he spotted Syria and he spotted Iran and Syria as we
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:58.160]  were writing different books on that and he said let's focus on Syria and I took
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:02.400]  that idea with him and I took the St. Martin's press and a book was coming
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:07.720]  out called out of the ashes which has to do now ironically impressively after
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.880]  15-20 years about the slaughter of Christians in the Middle East in Syria
[02:42:12.880 --> 02:42:17.400]  along with the Druze, the Shiites, the Sunnis and others and the support they
[02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:22.840]  received from Russia and Iran versus Saudi Arabia and the other Sunnis so our
[02:42:22.840 --> 02:42:27.160]  ability to really go over conversations is almost like the strategic planning
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:31.600]  analysis if you were to hear what we've talked about just two guys and
[02:42:31.600 --> 02:42:36.600]  formally sitting in shorts and t-shirts he was smoking and I didn't smoke and
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:40.280]  sometimes I'd say to him Tom could you just you know blow it outside and
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:44.560]  sometimes I'd have to hide the cigarettes for him and then he would kind of force
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:48.720]  me and attempt to get me to find out where I hid the cigarettes but in the
[02:42:48.720 --> 02:42:52.760]  long run I gave them off but he was a great friend I will miss him I think
[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:57.120]  America will miss an American hero and patriot and really one of the great
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.160]  writers of American literature for the 20th century so I feel honored and very
[02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:06.360]  pleased that you bring me on your show to save this because I think he would
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:10.560]  have been very honored to be celebrated on your show Alex he was a great
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:16.480]  admirer of your show he always listened to it you know I would talk about it and
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:21.200]  you'd always be amazed by some of the things that you did and what you had
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:26.240]  said about 9-11 and you and I and and you know he never contradicted people and
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:30.680]  and when he did he was very forceful he had his own ideas but contrary to what
[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:36.560]  most people thought he was not a ideologue in the strongest sense of the
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:40.320]  word he would always listen to somebody's comment he would always listen to the
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:44.960]  argument and he would and he would learn you know there were many times with
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:49.640]  different perspectives and I would change my perspective he would change his
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:54.360]  perspective and it was always a really fascinating relationship I almost felt
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:59.600]  as if I had been tooted and worked with a Jesuit you know he was the finest of
[02:43:59.600 --> 02:44:04.440]  Jesuit training in the best sense of the word and and now Baltimore should be
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:09.320]  honored to have him as their favorite son but also I think the Jesuit training
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:14.160]  really came out in his literature his analytical way his perspective his
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:18.440]  detail and understanding by the way doctor I don't want to interrupt you but
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:21.440]  you just dropped a bombshell I mean I think once you'd mentioned that Tom was
[02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:26.240]  aware of my work years ago and I've been interviewing you now for about 12 years
[02:44:26.240 --> 02:44:31.880]  or I've got right at 12 years but I'm blown away Tom Clancy was a regular
[02:44:31.880 --> 02:44:37.680]  listener well he listened to your work yes wow what you have to say he didn't
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:42.080]  comment on it but he listened to what you had to say he was very interested in
[02:44:42.080 --> 02:44:46.920]  almost all perspectives on the ideological spectrum on the extreme right
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:51.560]  or left but he didn't even categorize you he would listen he would listen to what
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:56.400]  I would have to say but your shows and perspectives and he wouldn't say very
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:00.160]  much he just got some things we would talk a little bit about it and then we
[02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:05.880]  would go on but honestly he was not an opinion he was opinionated at certain
[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:10.560]  points but overall he had a very broad perspective over many issues and he was
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:18.840]  willing to listen was he suspicious was he suspicious of 9-11 yes he kind of
[02:45:18.840 --> 02:45:23.560]  answered it in a way you have to remember one thing with Tom's brilliant book
[02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:30.120]  was written at where he literally described in 1996 and he and I talked
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:34.680]  about it the attack of a plane into the Capitol building so when Tom the
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:40.680]  least the right responded in front of the 9-11 Commission that nobody had ever thought
[02:45:40.680 --> 02:45:45.400]  of this concept that a plane could have been attacking any one of our buildings
[02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:49.520]  that Tom and I talked about it and what are you talking about you know this
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:54.240]  Tom Clancy had written about this almost 10 years beforehand and it was
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:45:59.400]  well-known and often when I had to do the off-center series with one of my
[02:45:59.400 --> 02:46:04.760]  writers Jeff Roman and we would have to clear it with at that time if you know we
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:09.040]  had a perspective or scenario and commutative that could have been a
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:13.840]  potential terrorist threat like a bomb in a tunnel we would often clear it with
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:18.040]  some national security individuals to say look we're gonna write about this we
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.280]  don't want it to happen but you know that's what we're talking about
[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:26.920]  so he was very much aware of the present threats and the clear and present
[02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:30.960]  dangers he was very I think sure sure well I mean plus I did see the media
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:35.120]  after 9-11 try to claim that that book you guys came up with and the plane
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:38.000]  flying into the Capitol that you may have given al-qaeda the idea that's
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:43.320]  ridiculous they had Navy drills given the idea no it was the other way exactly
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:47.240]  I was about the fact that the administration was lying well I was
[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:50.880]  about to say though I was about to say it came out there were Navy drills of the
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:56.240]  Capitol being attacked by a jumbo jet in 1977 they had drills in the 90s and
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:46:59.480]  that's probably I'm guessing where Tom and you picked that up right was the
[02:46:59.480 --> 02:47:05.120]  drills now honestly no he came up with the initial idea and I said you know I
[02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:09.240]  think it's a brilliant idea you know I don't think the probability of that
[02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:13.640]  happening from my perspective in reality was not great at the time that's when
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:17.800]  we were writing he was discussing the book my point is you didn't give al-qaeda
[02:47:17.800 --> 02:47:21.080]  you didn't give the al-qaeda the idea plus we know the official stories of
[02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:24.040]  fraud and let me stop you there since you're coming on for a full hour next
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:26.800]  week I wanted to get you on for a full hour but you can't do it today because
[02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:30.520]  of time let me bring this up to you Dr. Steve Pacanik former head of state
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:33.880]  department psychological warfare operations let me bring this up I'm sure
[02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:39.760]  you know Sy Hirsch came out last week drudge report carried it in the Guardian
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:45.080]  Info Wars has the story Seymour Hirsch been lauding raid one big line he says
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:49.200]  it's 100% falls from his sources I don't want to go into details that we're in
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:54.480]  contact with Sy Hirsch I have a great respect to Sy Hirsch first of all I
[02:47:54.480 --> 02:48:00.480]  knew I knew what I heard for over 20 30 years secondly I heard her sources are
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:04.800]  impeccable I can tell you that from all the way back in the Reagan and Nixon
[02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:10.360]  administration thirdly Sy Hirsch's wife was a psychiatrist who was trained by one
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:15.400]  of my friends so I you know not because he and I agree I'm just a great admirer
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:20.080]  of Sy Hirsch and I know his sources are impeccable I know he's a critical
[02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:24.760]  thinker and and he's nobody's cool so I agree you know I've said this a long
[02:48:24.760 --> 02:48:29.680]  time ago there was no rate there was false flags and we have an administration
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:34.280]  where the president is constantly doing this and that's why I want the American
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:38.240]  public and thanks to you Alex we're bringing this stuff repeatedly you know
[02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.600]  I can go into detail about the Navy or and why it's a false flag but you know
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:47.560]  you can't have a psychotic who's paranoid listening to ways and having
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:52.040]  delusions having a security plan and at the same time I was about to say the
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:56.200]  fact that they the police came all these times and didn't pick him up and then
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:00.640]  they let him in it looks like from what I've seen it looks like there was some
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:05.160]  kind of a drill he was set up I know you say you have intel but you wanted to
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:08.120]  talk about it and then we were gonna go off into Clancy today do you want to
[02:49:08.120 --> 02:49:12.680]  briefly tell us what happened at the Naval yard well I think it's a false flag it's like
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:17.240]  you can I mean it's not possible you see films of people laughing before him
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.320]  were announcing you do you have a scenario that's totally concocted it's
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.920]  totally out of control the chief of naval operation for a year knows he has a
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:29.920]  problem that he testified before Congress in the Senate he can't have a
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:34.680]  budget he he he shouldn't have warship he shouldn't be destroyed he doesn't need
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:38.640]  a yeah so it's about it's about the sequestration and I saw your article or
[02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:43.560]  your comments is deep it's you know what the Navy does desperately in order to
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:47.640]  maintain their budget they don't need it we have a problem in terms of what we
[02:49:47.640 --> 02:49:53.080]  need the Navy for it it's used for step denying actually sure separately doctor
[02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:57.440]  do you have any info on the missing warheads from Dias Air Force Base no
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:02.680]  no Alex I have no idea but let me just finish with Tom Plancy to say you know
[02:50:02.680 --> 02:50:07.560]  he began with Navy submarines and he had a great respect for the Navy but now
[02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:11.920]  you know America has to understand from the Clancy books in my own books to both
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:17.240]  the books we wrote this country is capable of writing false narrative and
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:21.680]  unfortunately they're in our business with Tom Clancy and I were writing fiction
[02:50:21.680 --> 02:50:26.080]  and a lot of what's happening from the intelligence and military community is
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:30.640]  fiction and it's a thing the American public is that stupid that they're gonna
[02:50:30.640 --> 02:50:36.160]  buy 9-11 or Osama bin Laden or killing Osama bin Laden they have a big mistake
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:41.480]  and that's the beginning of the ending of a constitutional democracy where you
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:46.800]  riddle your own citizens and the fact that Tom Clancy was able to predict
[02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:50.880]  what's going to happen the fact that he wrote about these elements and then the
[02:50:50.880 --> 02:50:55.200]  fact that we have different administration lying repeatedly it's not
[02:50:55.200 --> 02:51:01.040]  gonna work well dr. take take the good news though the public now knows the
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:04.860]  government's running al-qaeda Carl Rove said famously the New York Times and
[02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:08.160]  Washington Post at a cocktail party doesn't matter what reality is we
[02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:11.400]  control reality and like lap dogs you're gonna agree to whatever the new
[02:51:11.400 --> 02:51:15.600]  reality is every day two plus two equals five now they teach that the public
[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:19.640]  school kids two plus two equals five teaching them false reality teaching the
[02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:24.400]  magical thinking sabotaging them intellectually I mean this is I've
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:28.280]  studied a lot of history like you have doctor I've never seen such a mentally
[02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:34.160]  ill group of elites myself who are messing with the public as some type of
[02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:39.480]  weird fetish I mean this is beyond tyrants this this is mass mental illness
[02:51:39.480 --> 02:51:43.920]  by the ruling class and their instinctive hatred of free market and
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:48.800]  America I think will be their undoing they are acting like lunatics
[02:51:48.800 --> 02:51:53.120]  transparently trying to block World War two vets from the World War two
[02:51:53.120 --> 02:51:58.640]  Veterans Memorial running around foaming at the mouth harassing the public I
[02:51:58.640 --> 02:52:04.680]  mean I think we're seeing a Nero or Caligula like madness well let me put it
[02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:10.160]  this way since I am a psychiatrist you know I we have a saying I may be
[02:52:10.160 --> 02:52:14.440]  crazy but I'm not stupid right now what you're not being it's a lunacy or
[02:52:14.440 --> 02:52:20.240]  irrationality you're seeing a very calculated program of trying to control
[02:52:20.240 --> 02:52:26.240]  the American public to access the the program for the storyline that the
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:30.480]  government wants them to listen to in other words 9 11 so that they could go
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:34.600]  to war in Iraq that didn't work we went to war in Afghanistan that didn't work
[02:52:34.600 --> 02:52:38.920]  we went to war in Yemen that didn't work so our military has failed us our
[02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:42.520]  leaders of the military have failed us the leaders of our intelligence John
[02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:48.320]  Brenner, Don Lin, Biden all of what I call a choir boys has failed us so now
[02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:53.040]  it's time for the American public to stand up in a constructive way and say
[02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:58.440]  to our legislators and our leaders it's enough the history of America is not
[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:04.640]  about false narratives and fake stories and make believe attacks and killings
[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:09.520]  like Obama has talked about it's not lunacy it's the attempt of power and
[02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:16.160]  greed to really control a democracy we are still a republic the republic has
[02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:20.640]  to respond if you have done nothing else Alex and why I enjoy working with you
[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:24.680]  and talking about you you have the courage to state certain things in a
[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:29.240]  certain way that's your prerogative and you did it 15 20 years ago when I went
[02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:33.800]  on the show and I said Osama bin Laden that's more funny you did but I could
[02:53:33.800 --> 02:53:39.720]  predict on the Alex Jones show that 10 years from 9 11 they're gonna pull out
[02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:43.840]  Osama bin Laden whoever the president is gonna be and make believe they killed
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:48.600]  them and they fell into that intelligence trap what you have is mediocre
[02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:55.200]  ineffectual leaders who can fall for one scyops glitch that I set up 10 years
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:53:58.840]  ago if you have that kind of incompetency which is what we have in the
[02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:02.800]  military and the intelligence community and the national security and the white
[02:54:02.800 --> 02:54:07.480]  out and you have a very low grade of leadership and that's sure sure I mean
[02:54:07.480 --> 02:54:10.320]  doctor doctor I'm not saying that they're gonna marry their horse like
[02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:15.560]  like Caligula my point is I get it's an organized program they're trying to
[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:20.000]  can confuse everybody they're trying to scramble everything they're trying to
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.680]  make us basically mentally ill I get all that but I'm just saying I think they've
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:29.240]  conned themselves they've jumped the shark they've gone a bridge too far and
[02:54:29.240 --> 02:54:33.320]  and and I really do think they're delusional at this point because I see
[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:36.960]  them losing on every front and and they seem to think they're in a great
[02:54:36.960 --> 02:54:41.000]  position but you have your ear to the ground in Washington do they understand
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.120]  or am I wrong in saying that you're not you're not wrong I think the way to best
[02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:49.360]  say what you're saying is not that they are delusional but it's basically the
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:54.480]  seeds of their own self-destruction were planted 30 to 40 years ago right after
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:55:00.560]  Blink Clinton came in he assisted in the 9-11 9-11 happened then you had two
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:05.280]  terms of post junior and then two times with Obama the seeds of self-destruction
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:10.120]  and national security and the domestic affairs and the legislature and in the
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:14.720]  process of electing president will come out now and I think the American
[02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:19.280]  public is beginning to more and more clarify their interests the best who
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:23.920]  said in World War II God bless them that said that's enough we're not going to have
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:28.680]  a barrier is really the metaphor for the American public no more barriers by the
[02:55:28.680 --> 02:55:36.400]  PSA no more barriers by ice no more barriers by any other authority institution
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:41.000]  that really doesn't have a value added to our national security if you think the
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.840]  war on terror is a real war and you're in another planet that war was created so
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:51.040]  that our military could have some reason to go into to utilize weapons that we
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:55.600]  don't even use anymore and to utilize surveillance systems that really aren't
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:59.280]  all that effective and protecting our national security with our national
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:03.320]  security institutions that's not realized they never studied American
[02:56:03.320 --> 02:56:08.000]  history they did not understand how men who fought the real of warfare like
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:12.480]  George Washington this technique was totally asymmetric warfare and they
[02:56:12.480 --> 02:56:17.280]  talked about asymmetric warfare as if they created it in the 20% no that's not
[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:21.680]  correct already George Washington was studying it under the French the Indians
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:26.080]  the British he was a British officer and we had a given take throughout our
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:30.480]  entire history but if they do not learn from American history the given take of
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.840]  power they will suffer from what you said their own self I was about to say
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:38.960]  they're using what I see is more of a high-tech Soviet model to shut down the
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:43.120]  economy mega-dependent it's not going to work with 400 million guns and we know
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.120]  that the globalist and these combines are raping us it's just not going to work
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:53.360]  because they already had control but now they're going to try to push it so far
[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:58.680]  to fully break us that they're going to make it basically snap back well let
[02:56:58.680 --> 02:57:02.520]  me give you an example Alex we didn't intend to do this but I still respect
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:06.320]  you and the audience I'll give you an example why it's not going to work for
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:11.200]  example the flooding of by the Federal Reserve of our banking system and our
[02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:16.760]  financial system by money created what I call and it's called zombie banks what
[02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:21.800]  is on the bank we have JP Morgan Chase we have City Bank we have Bank of America
[02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:27.120]  totally filled with what we call toxic asset in other words these guys despite
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:32.880]  their corruption despite their net net not only took money because they made
[02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:37.280]  very bad loans they couldn't make the proper risk assessments but then they
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:42.880]  were funded so what we have a paralyzed financial institutions who are so corrupt
[02:57:42.880 --> 02:57:48.200]  that they basically can't help themselves like 18 Morgan Goldman tax all of
[02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:54.720]  them are being now indicted by federal prosecutors so even though we funded them
[02:57:54.720 --> 02:57:59.280]  they became zombie banks with zombie financial institutions like the AIG
[02:57:59.280 --> 02:58:03.520]  and Ben Moshe said that we have to be grateful for them no they lost 18
[02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:08.760]  billion or 180 billion we funded them they were running secondary repos and
[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:13.240]  derivatives and basically what was saying the American public has had enough
[02:58:13.240 --> 02:58:18.360]  and quite frankly there are lawyers and civil servants within the system who
[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:22.560]  are coming back and saying you know what JP Morgan you've been indicted eight
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:26.160]  times already you've been indicted for water manipulation and run
