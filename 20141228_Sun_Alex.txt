[00:00.000 --> 00:10.780]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[00:10.780 --> 00:13.160]  the mind of man.
[00:13.160 --> 00:38.160]  Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:38.160 --> 00:59.840]  If you're a radio listener, we are playing video for TV viewers, I'll be describing it
[00:59.840 --> 01:06.160]  below, it's online at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:06.160 --> 01:17.560]  Uncle Murder is the name of the song and it deals with a Eric Garner tribute that came
[01:17.560 --> 01:25.600]  out about a week before the two New York police officers were executed and it basically
[01:25.600 --> 01:34.320]  calls verbally but also visually for the execution of police in New York.
[01:34.320 --> 01:42.440]  And guess who funded it, this is on record, guess who funded it with a $1.5 million grant
[01:42.440 --> 01:47.240]  to produce this and other little jewels.
[01:47.240 --> 01:51.960]  The New American Magazine reports with links to the funding, we'll click on the link and
[01:51.960 --> 01:59.600]  actually go to the New American, Justice Department grants link to cop killing rap video.
[01:59.600 --> 02:04.880]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we are uniquely qualified in my humble view to speak to this
[02:04.880 --> 02:08.040]  from a non-biased position.
[02:08.040 --> 02:12.400]  I've made four films in the police state, I've written a book on it, I've warned about
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.680]  everything that's now unfolding and we've warned about the attempt to start a civil
[02:17.680 --> 02:23.760]  war in this country starting with race war.
[02:23.760 --> 02:33.040]  And now it's starting to happen and in almost every case, the Justice Department is shock
[02:33.040 --> 02:36.080]  puppeting the entire operation.
[02:36.080 --> 02:44.080]  Let's be clear, there are a lot of good police around this country, there are also a lot
[02:44.080 --> 02:51.480]  of bad departments and bad police, but you cannot scapegoat the police in general and
[02:51.480 --> 02:57.740]  make them the reason the government's corrupt and the reason there's problems in this country.
[02:57.740 --> 03:02.360]  And then have a bunch of scum of the earth, I mean, I've looked at these Facebook and
[03:02.360 --> 03:11.640]  Twitter profiles, scum of the earth, gangster criminal type folks that promote the knockout
[03:11.640 --> 03:16.040]  game and all other forms of racial assault who are the equivalent of black Ku Klux Klan
[03:16.040 --> 03:19.320]  members in my view.
[03:19.320 --> 03:25.760]  Out there saying kill white people or kill police, it is outrageous and it's going to
[03:25.760 --> 03:29.400]  get a lot worse, ladies and gentlemen, and it's going to cause major racial division
[03:29.400 --> 03:30.400]  in this country.
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.760]  We need to come together as Martin Luther King said, not dealing with race, but with
[03:34.760 --> 03:38.440]  what we stand for collectively.
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.080]  Freedom, private property, due process, right to self-defense, family, right to religion,
[03:44.080 --> 03:50.320]  freedom, prosperity, capitalism.
[03:50.320 --> 03:54.320]  As capitalism goes out the window and get this crony system, yeah, our country's fallen
[03:54.320 --> 03:59.880]  apart and sure, the face of government and the face of a lot of revenue generation and
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.000]  problems sometimes is the police.
[04:02.000 --> 04:08.760]  But they already set the police state up.
[04:08.760 --> 04:11.360]  Now they want us to have a civil war.
[04:11.360 --> 04:13.160]  How about we don't have it?
[04:13.160 --> 04:16.280]  You notice I've been harping on this for six months.
[04:16.280 --> 04:24.440]  Two weeks before Brown was killed, I put an emergency alert out, openly saying, get ready
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.600]  for them to start things up big time, it's about to happen because I could see all the
[04:28.600 --> 04:29.600]  preconditioning.
[04:29.600 --> 04:32.560]  Well, that's happening right now.
[04:32.560 --> 04:37.080]  Now that's not all I'm going to cover today, but we have video and audio, Decava Halls
[04:37.080 --> 04:42.400]  with rows of dead cops, Ferguson protesters, they caught one of the top liberal protesters,
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.600]  who claims he's a peacenink, he confessed to torching businesses.
[04:46.600 --> 04:49.600]  I mean, this is not the face of a revolution we need.
[04:49.600 --> 04:54.960]  We need a revolution of ideas, not a revolution of a bunch of leftist trust fund kids, white
[04:54.960 --> 05:00.160]  kids, not trying to leave blacks to murder police and stuff.
[05:00.160 --> 05:06.360]  The average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges, unlock the energy it takes to
[05:06.360 --> 05:12.440]  defeat these daily beasts with super male or super female vitality, specifically designed
[05:12.440 --> 05:19.040]  to assist the body in regulating proper hormone balance to create superior vitality in males
[05:19.040 --> 05:20.720]  and females.
[05:20.720 --> 05:30.080]  Overcharge and conquer your world at enforcelife.com or call 188-253-3139.
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.760]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[05:33.760 --> 05:38.120]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[05:38.120 --> 05:40.120]  Can you put two and two together?
[05:40.120 --> 05:45.720]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[05:45.720 --> 05:47.720]  priced and fully legal.
[05:47.720 --> 05:55.800]  But for how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L, body armor dot com.
[05:55.800 --> 06:21.800]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[06:21.800 --> 06:30.240]  This is the final Sunday broadcast of 2014.
[06:30.240 --> 06:34.880]  It is the 28th day of December 2014.
[06:34.880 --> 06:40.560]  I'll be back, of course, tomorrow with the weekday transmission, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.360]  Standard Time.
[06:42.360 --> 06:46.520]  You can find us, of course, at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[06:46.520 --> 06:53.120]  You can find the nightly news at infowarsnews.com, weeknights, 7 o'clock central on Roku, Boxy,
[06:53.120 --> 06:57.800]  and many cable and TV systems around the country as well.
[06:57.800 --> 07:00.360]  But this will be the final Sunday transmission.
[07:00.360 --> 07:05.320]  We come in live on Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m., with a two-hour abbreviated transmission.
[07:05.320 --> 07:07.240]  We have the weekday three-hour broadcast.
[07:07.240 --> 07:12.680]  I'm here to tell you we're not going to be talking about Airbus.
[07:12.680 --> 07:25.720]  Our Asia Airbus goes missing, flying out of Malaysia with 162 aboard, bad weather, forced
[07:25.720 --> 07:29.920]  suspension of search, pilot ass to deviate from flight plan.
[07:29.920 --> 07:33.400]  Missing plane is third, Malaysian-linked incident this year.
[07:33.400 --> 07:37.960]  The famous one that disappeared around Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
[07:37.960 --> 07:41.480]  Then, of course, there was another one that shot down over Ukraine.
[07:41.480 --> 07:45.080]  Now this one, carriers have nearly flawless safety record.
[07:45.080 --> 07:48.280]  AFP has a live feed report.
[07:48.280 --> 07:49.280]  That's from drudgereport.com.
[07:49.280 --> 07:53.480]  And it's interesting to cover, and we have it on infowars.com too.
[07:53.480 --> 07:55.960]  I'm not saying it's not an interesting, important news story.
[07:55.960 --> 07:59.680]  It's just compared to all the other stuff I've got, we're not going to obsess over it
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.960]  today, but I know this.
[08:04.960 --> 08:13.920]  Air travel in and out of Malaysia is getting really weird statistically in the actuaries.
[08:13.920 --> 08:16.560]  Articles have been written about it.
[08:16.560 --> 08:21.760]  Why is there so much air disaster associated with that country?
[08:21.760 --> 08:23.360]  It's very suspicious.
[08:23.360 --> 08:29.880]  And then each one of the cases is more suspicious, like who shot it down or why did it disappear?
[08:29.880 --> 08:32.280]  And now, what happened with this one?
[08:32.280 --> 08:36.400]  And the media will be conspiracy theorists all day and all week long because they love
[08:36.400 --> 08:37.400]  a mystery.
[08:37.400 --> 08:46.520]  Well, I love a mystery as well, if, and that's a key word, if it really has important import
[08:46.520 --> 08:49.560]  on my daily life and your daily life in my view.
[08:49.560 --> 08:54.880]  Now some people may think this is super incredibly important, and maybe it is.
[08:54.880 --> 09:00.520]  It's just we're not going to be basically drooling over this all day.
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.960]  What we are going to be covering is this.
[09:05.960 --> 09:13.440]  They have had lizard squad that is the confirmed marquee top two or three hacking groups in
[09:13.440 --> 09:19.160]  the world come out providing data and proof on Sky News out of the UK.
[09:19.160 --> 09:25.400]  That's Fox TV UK that they carried out the attacks on Sony and others and they had nothing
[09:25.400 --> 09:29.120]  to do with North Korea.
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.960]  Now look, if North Korea wants to censor us and tell us what to think and what to do,
[09:32.960 --> 09:37.200]  I say go see the film to challenge them.
[09:37.200 --> 09:46.560]  They're also admitting that they've hacked into Xbox and so many other systems.
[09:46.560 --> 09:52.720]  But when Sony is clearly involved behaving and acting like it was North Korea just to
[09:52.720 --> 09:55.120]  sell tickets, it's a fraud.
[09:55.120 --> 10:00.040]  The real censorship is by Communist China, scores of movies, Red Dawn, the remake and
[10:00.040 --> 10:05.440]  others have been shelled for up to a year while they're re-edited to cut out criticism
[10:05.440 --> 10:08.880]  of Communist China or their government.
[10:08.880 --> 10:13.640]  See that's meat and potatoes, public stuff we should deal with.
[10:13.640 --> 10:21.960]  Exodus Deadline Live Hollywood reports will not be released in the UAE.
[10:21.960 --> 10:29.560]  One follow similar moves in Egypt and Morocco, Ridley Scott's Exodus.
[10:29.560 --> 10:34.720]  I love Ridley Scott's gladiators so I do intend to try to see it, pull it as incredible action,
[10:34.720 --> 10:39.520]  not very good acting but I'm going to go see it if I get time to.
[10:39.520 --> 10:41.760]  But there you go, censorship there.
[10:41.760 --> 10:47.280]  Pakistan officials furious over homeland, the TV show Homeland that implies they're
[10:47.280 --> 10:49.920]  terrorist in Pakistan.
[10:49.920 --> 10:52.480]  So that government's upset.
[10:52.480 --> 10:59.480]  See all of this Sony talk, placating North Korea about the interview has only encouraged
[10:59.480 --> 11:06.160]  all these other censors around the world to try to make us live like they do.
[11:06.160 --> 11:11.360]  But think about the UN and all these UN internet treaties and SISPA and SOPA that are being
[11:11.360 --> 11:17.920]  reintroduced next week, they'll be reintroduced on the first, that's Thursday.
[11:17.920 --> 11:21.600]  They're going to reintroduce all the internet censorship bills in the name of fighting what
[11:21.600 --> 11:31.360]  happened to Sony, see problem reaction solution, false flag written all over it.
[11:31.360 --> 11:35.200]  Now that's not the most important news in the stack today, it's just something interesting
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.400]  because there is an attack on free speech, implying that free speech causes all the problems
[11:39.400 --> 11:40.400]  in the world.
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.680]  Well most hell holes around the world don't have free speech, I'll just put it at that
[11:45.680 --> 11:46.840]  and leave it at that.
[11:46.840 --> 11:52.560]  I want to get into the economy, US economic recovery finally taking hold CNBC reports,
[11:52.560 --> 11:55.080]  we're going to break down how that is a fraud.
[11:55.080 --> 11:59.640]  I would love the economy to take hold and to get better.
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.280]  I live in this country, but Russia's imploding, China's imploding, Japan is imploding, the
[12:05.280 --> 12:10.440]  EU's in trouble, the Middle East is in turmoil, serious economic problems, Latin America is
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.920]  in a major recession to depression, all the real economic numbers, in fact I'll just cover
[12:14.920 --> 12:18.000]  this now before I get out of the niche, all the other economic numbers.
[12:18.000 --> 12:24.320]  How about 101 million people not in the workforce in this country, 300 million people, 320 million?
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.640]  How about 50 million on food stamps?
[12:26.640 --> 12:30.160]  How about another 45 million on disability?
[12:30.160 --> 12:35.200]  Yet it all together, half the country doesn't work and they're raising taxes on the other
[12:35.200 --> 12:36.200]  half that does.
[12:36.200 --> 12:40.120]  So here's the numbers, US economic recovery finally taking hold, that's using cooked
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.120]  stats on inflation and employment, I mean everybody knows those are fake.
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.520]  When they use old 1980s numbers, John Williams and shadow stats top economist, we got like
[12:51.520 --> 12:58.680]  25% unemployment, 10% inflation, but it's not evenly distributed.
[12:58.680 --> 13:05.500]  US consumer spending rises solidly, well yeah, because it was just Christmas, China's trade
[13:05.500 --> 13:13.320]  growth seemed falling short of target in 2014, CNBC, Japan approved 29 billion stimulus
[13:13.320 --> 13:20.960]  plan, impact in doubt, Russia forecast economic slump as bailed out bank gets more funds.
[13:20.960 --> 13:28.320]  Meanwhile, the semi euphoria over declining jobless rate, one nagging statistic persist,
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.720]  labor for participation, the job market continues to slide, since the great recession of 08,
[13:34.720 --> 13:37.480]  7 million Americans have dropped out of labor force.
[13:37.480 --> 13:43.960]  So how is the economy good when there's less people working than any time in modern history?
[13:43.960 --> 13:49.880]  Because they're printing fiat money and the world still accepts it, but not for long and
[13:49.880 --> 13:51.880]  they can't hide all the inflation.
[13:51.880 --> 13:58.760]  And when it finally goes, when it finally collapses in, Katie bar the door, and you've
[13:58.760 --> 14:05.040]  probably heard, let's not exaggerate, 50, 60 economists with good track records come
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.560]  on this broadcast and break all this down.
[14:08.560 --> 14:15.520]  Price plunge puts oil patch jobs at risk in the US, dipping into the auto equity and
[14:15.520 --> 14:20.680]  just goes into all people getting into so many of these payday loans and mortgages on
[14:20.680 --> 14:26.080]  their cars and just it's debt, our society is driven by debt.
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.160]  And until we become net savers again, we will wake up homeless on the continent our
[14:31.160 --> 14:37.600]  forebears built.
[14:37.600 --> 14:47.680]  We're also going to get into chaos in the Alps as massive snowfall traps, 15,000 cars.
[14:47.680 --> 14:52.760]  Some areas have up to 10 feet of snow as they see some of the heaviest snowfall and recorded
[14:52.760 --> 14:58.720]  record in the Alps through Germany, Switzerland, France into Northern Italy.
[14:58.720 --> 15:01.440]  Oh, yeah, they had snowfall.
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.960]  They had a white Christmas in Hawaii.
[15:04.960 --> 15:11.520]  Last week, they had a white Christmas, ladies and gentlemen, Thursday when it snowed in
[15:11.520 --> 15:14.920]  Hawaii and the mountain tops were snow capped.
[15:14.920 --> 15:17.880]  They were white capped.
[15:17.880 --> 15:20.560]  What's the tallest mountain in the Alps, Mont Blanc?
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.040]  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:24.040 --> 15:29.520]  But meanwhile, Google and Al Gore say, pay them more taxes.
[15:29.520 --> 15:32.720]  Let them run your lives because the earth is heating because of people.
[15:32.720 --> 15:34.240]  I'm going to give you a newsflash.
[15:34.240 --> 15:36.160]  The temperature goes up and down.
[15:36.160 --> 15:37.920]  The only constant is change.
[15:37.920 --> 15:38.920]  Now we come back.
[15:38.920 --> 15:42.160]  It's now confirmed double triple quadruple.
[15:42.160 --> 15:48.160]  The Justice Department is running all of this kill the cop race war garbage.
[15:48.160 --> 15:49.160]  We're going to decipher it.
[15:49.160 --> 15:53.440]  We have video and audio of a rat video produced a week before the cops were killed in New
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.440]  York.
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.720]  The funeral was today funded by the Justice Department, saying, go out and shoot New York
[15:58.720 --> 16:00.720]  police in the head.
[16:00.720 --> 16:02.960]  2015 is almost here.
[16:02.960 --> 16:08.000]  And with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform your body the way you
[16:08.000 --> 16:09.000]  want it.
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.760]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[16:12.760 --> 16:17.880]  Make this year different by equipping yourself with oxy powder, the next level in cleansing
[16:17.880 --> 16:23.240]  the body naturally using super oxygenation oxy powder available through info wars life

[16:36.640 --> 16:37.640]  in about a week.
[16:37.640 --> 16:41.600]  I'd say a week seven days and I've been able to keep it off to my wife is like, wow, you

[20:26.320 --> 20:30.920]  about left or right it's about right and wrong and i simply try to assess each situation
[20:30.920 --> 20:35.520]  according to justice the constitution bill of rights and common sense and how i want
[20:35.520 --> 20:41.360]  to be treated the golden rule and certainly there's been globalization of police they've
[20:41.360 --> 20:47.000]  been given paramilitary training feeding into that the country's been degenerating with
[20:47.000 --> 20:51.800]  the war on drugs and the rest of it that's destroyed mexico and many other countries
[20:51.800 --> 20:56.140]  so there's a lot of contributing factors to this but if you want to understand what's
[20:56.140 --> 21:00.640]  happening with this new war on police that's being pushed by the mainstream media and by
[21:00.640 --> 21:05.360]  the white house of the justice department need to back up to two thousand and two when
[21:05.360 --> 21:12.400]  joseph stiglitz two time nobel prize winner for economics came on this broadcast right
[21:12.400 --> 21:17.160]  after secret documents have been leaked at the world bank where he was the chief economist
[21:17.160 --> 21:23.600]  he just left he says he didn't leak them okay but he came on and spoke about the documents
[21:23.600 --> 21:27.920]  and i wrote a book about it nine eleven the road to tyranny showing a nine eleven would
[21:27.920 --> 21:33.000]  be used to set up a police state but we also did a couple chapters on those documents in
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.480]  the book and in the i m f and world bank documents there's a hundred and eleven point plan and
[21:39.480 --> 21:44.760]  one of the hundred and eleven points of what the i m f world bank do in concert in a country
[21:44.760 --> 21:50.280]  first world old world or third world is when they're getting ready to really implode the
[21:50.280 --> 21:57.480]  country they will stir up social unrest focus it on the police to destabilize things then
[21:57.480 --> 22:03.400]  that implodes the country in civil unrest and then the globalist can come in and buy the
[22:03.400 --> 22:09.360]  nation up like grease a few years ago for pennies on the dollar oh yeah cops remember
[22:09.360 --> 22:15.840]  getting shot and killed in Greece just a few years ago this is in the plan so regardless
[22:15.840 --> 22:21.200]  of whether you're angry at the police or not the justice department was found stirring
[22:21.200 --> 22:26.400]  up people to riot with Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case they've been caught in Ferguson
[22:26.400 --> 22:33.320]  stirring it up it's on record while they audit and harass the tea party gun owners groups
[22:33.320 --> 22:38.240]  libertarian groups christian groups while there's a political reign of terror on peaceful law
[22:38.240 --> 22:44.680]  abiding groups all these different ford foundation groups and others are funding la raza matcha
[22:44.680 --> 22:50.440]  the new black panthers all this racial tension division because they want these groups of
[22:50.440 --> 22:57.160]  their own little racial groups not adopting the idea of basic freedom that unifies us
[22:57.160 --> 23:04.200]  all divide and conquer but now today we have two different videos for radio listeners go

[23:26.440 --> 23:35.760]  videos this is a popular chant and then I've got all these other articles Ferguson protester

[23:46.000 --> 23:51.880]  in Ferguson or excuse me peace advocate in Ferguson protest charged with felony arson
[23:51.880 --> 24:01.520]  and is confessed on video to setting fires this is not the face we want on resisting
[24:01.520 --> 24:07.320]  tyranny and reforming the country this is mindlessness this will make the whole globalist
[24:07.320 --> 24:12.760]  takeover look like a good thing in response to the destabilization that's being carried
[24:12.760 --> 24:22.160]  out now here's the key article I'm going to get to with video in a moment justice department
[24:22.160 --> 24:28.720]  grants link to cop killing rap video new american magazine news article we have it posted info
[24:28.720 --> 24:33.200]  wars dot com with the video now there's so many cuss words I'm not going to play it here
[24:33.200 --> 24:39.440]  I'm not going to beep it you can see it unedited on info wars dot com or prison planet dot com
[24:39.440 --> 24:44.360]  but yet again it's the justice department involved after we play these clips I'm going
[24:44.360 --> 24:50.320]  to break down why they're involved in my view but here is the deck the halls with rows of
[24:50.320 --> 24:55.480]  dead cops video and audio out of st louis last night here it is
[24:55.480 --> 25:20.560]  the
[25:20.560 --> 25:34.680]  I guarantee you for being in the middle of this for 20 years, when I first learned about
[25:34.680 --> 25:37.880]  this stuff like 18 years ago, I couldn't believe it.
[25:37.880 --> 25:44.440]  Those were all white, rich, 20-year-old trust fund kids, Democratic Party.
[25:44.440 --> 25:49.760]  We've seen their signs and what group sponsor, right back to George Soros.
[25:49.760 --> 25:59.320]  They are out there marching around with the Ferguson protesters, trying to get them to
[25:59.320 --> 26:02.320]  go out and commit crime, in my view, but that's clear what they're doing.
[26:02.320 --> 26:03.320]  It's not my view.
[26:03.320 --> 26:04.320]  I mean, there it is.
[26:04.320 --> 26:06.520]  It's prima facie on its face.
[26:06.520 --> 26:12.080]  Now, if that isn't bad enough, and I've got more clips like that, here's the article by
[26:12.080 --> 26:16.320]  Alex Newman, who we've had on the broadcast before, investigative journalist, Justice
[26:16.320 --> 26:22.880]  Department Grants linked a cop-killing rap video, the American people needed more evidence
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.520]  that the Obama administration, Justice Department was out of control.
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.920]  After six years of nonstop scandals, it was recently revealed that the DOJ was funding
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.160]  a community close-code organization linked to a controversial rap music video that they're
[26:38.160 --> 26:42.040]  funding glorifying the murder of New York police officers.
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.560]  The group in question, Bronx defenders, just like Akron, has received at least $1.5 million
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.920]  in U.S. taxpayer dollars from the Department of Justice and played a prominent role in
[26:51.920 --> 26:54.280]  the pro cop-killing music video.
[26:54.280 --> 26:59.240]  The link between a widely condemned rap production of the DOJ made headlines this week after
[26:59.240 --> 27:04.240]  two New York police department officers were murdered execution style under the guise of
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.840]  obtaining revenge for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, even though it was a totally
[27:08.840 --> 27:11.280]  different jurisdiction in both cases.
[27:11.280 --> 27:14.200]  This is just crazy.
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.440]  The explosive link between the Justice Department funded organization and the glorification
[27:18.440 --> 27:22.320]  of violence against police officers was first reported by the Heritage Foundation's Daily
[27:22.320 --> 27:24.520]  Signal news outlet on December 22nd.
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.160]  It was not immediately clear whether the Bronx defenders group, which is featured in the
[27:28.160 --> 27:32.080]  video along with the staff attorneys of the organization, played a role in financing the
[27:32.080 --> 27:35.200]  violent film, but they are clearly involved in it.
[27:35.200 --> 27:40.320]  In addition to DOJ's funding offering under the program, ironically named after the murdered
[27:40.320 --> 27:45.520]  NYPD officer, the organization has also received upwards of $40 million from city taxpayers
[27:45.520 --> 27:47.920]  just two years, and just two years.
[27:47.920 --> 27:52.640]  So far, the Bronx defenders largely remain silent about the full extent of its involvement
[27:52.640 --> 27:56.120]  in the production, according to media reports, and it goes through the rest of it.
[27:56.120 --> 28:02.280]  And we're showing some clips of this.
[28:02.280 --> 28:08.720]  And look, it isn't like there aren't some trigger-happy police out there who don't end
[28:08.720 --> 28:12.320]  up shooting innocent people.
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.160]  But the way this is all billed, it's black against white in the video.
[28:16.160 --> 28:19.680]  When I've been to New York, about half the cops there are not white, but in New York
[28:19.680 --> 28:20.920]  probably 15 times.
[28:20.920 --> 28:25.080]  There's just about, I've seen the numbers, about half of them are, quote, minority,
[28:25.080 --> 28:31.680]  which is really the majority in New York, so this is all total propaganda.
[28:31.680 --> 28:33.520]  Why is it happening?
[28:33.520 --> 28:35.880]  It's very simple.
[28:35.880 --> 28:40.360]  They want to get us at each other's throats, and then Homeland Security will be able to
[28:40.360 --> 28:44.480]  take more liberties, more freedom, and further federalize police.
[28:44.480 --> 28:49.040]  Because if you get federalized, you then don't get scrutinized when your officers do things
[28:49.040 --> 28:50.040]  that are questionable.
[28:50.040 --> 28:55.560]  So this is the globalist who control our federal government trying to force the police to become
[28:55.560 --> 28:59.120]  federalized, and they're trying to destabilize the country.
[28:59.120 --> 29:01.120]  It's sick.
[29:01.120 --> 29:05.080]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its
[29:05.080 --> 29:06.080]  creation.

[33:03.320 --> 33:19.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.240 --> 33:25.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the
[33:25.360 --> 33:33.960]  GCN Radio Network.
[33:33.960 --> 33:40.880]  We've been trained to think of the world as cowboy versus the Redskins, Coke versus Pepsi,
[33:40.880 --> 33:43.880]  Chevy versus Ford just mindlessly.
[33:43.880 --> 33:48.720]  So you're either with the cops and just back anything police do anywhere in the world or
[33:48.720 --> 33:50.320]  you're against them.
[33:50.320 --> 33:53.600]  Or you're either for killing all the police and call blood.
[33:53.600 --> 33:56.520]  No, I'm not on either side of that.
[33:56.520 --> 34:01.040]  I don't support North Korean or corrupt Mexican police.
[34:01.040 --> 34:07.440]  I wouldn't support Nazi Gestapo in Hitler's Germany or Fidel Castro's secret police.
[34:07.440 --> 34:12.520]  I want to keep our police free and local and constitutional.
[34:12.520 --> 34:15.640]  And let me tell you what will corrupt the police even faster.
[34:15.640 --> 34:22.200]  Start in civil war where we attack the police as part of our anger at the government.
[34:22.200 --> 34:25.520]  That is the last place that you're going to get any reform.
[34:25.520 --> 34:31.480]  You're going to get a hardening of the police, a globalization, a federalization, a militarization
[34:31.480 --> 34:36.600]  where it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where they're being killed in cold blood so
[34:36.600 --> 34:41.200]  they become even more vicious towards the public, which is exactly what the social engineers
[34:41.200 --> 34:43.600]  want.
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.800]  And I've been harping on this intensely for years, but really intensely like a woodpecker
[34:48.800 --> 34:56.920]  for about six months because you can see it happening in real time.
[34:56.920 --> 34:59.840]  And part of this is folks don't like being revenue generated.
[34:59.840 --> 35:02.520]  They don't like the surveillance cameras, the NSA.
[35:02.520 --> 35:05.960]  Yes, our government at the federal level has been seized.
[35:05.960 --> 35:08.720]  Many state governments are corrupt as well.
[35:08.720 --> 35:11.640]  Many local governments are, but many aren't.
[35:11.640 --> 35:13.220]  And it's still individuals.
[35:13.220 --> 35:17.440]  This is the plan to get us all of each other's throats.
[35:17.440 --> 35:26.960]  What matters is that the system wants desperately to create civil unrest in this country along
[35:26.960 --> 35:32.360]  racial, religious, and governmental lines.
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.360]  I mean, I criticize the private federal reserve running our country's monetary system into
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.480]  the ground and giving select banks free money, but not the citizens.
[35:41.480 --> 35:44.360]  And then we get the debt on that money.
[35:44.360 --> 35:49.440]  Then they have the Southern Prairie Law Center and the White House and MSNBC and CNN call
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.440]  me anti-government.
[35:51.440 --> 36:02.920]  Yes, I'm anti-illegitimate, alien, fraudulent government running my life.
[36:02.920 --> 36:06.000]  But what's really anti-government?
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.760]  The Justice Department and Obama coming out and the mayor of New York going, yeah, we
[36:11.760 --> 36:13.640]  know the cops are really bad.
[36:13.640 --> 36:20.080]  It's racism and we're going to do something about it.
[36:20.080 --> 36:24.640]  Are there racist police in this country on all different sides and angles?
[36:24.640 --> 36:25.640]  Probably, yes.
[36:25.640 --> 36:31.680]  I mean, I'd say probably every jurisdiction has some, undoubtedly nationwide there is.
[36:31.680 --> 36:34.520]  But is that the only issue in the world?
[36:34.520 --> 36:40.280]  And then is it defendable like Time Magazine said a month ago in defense of rioting was
[36:40.280 --> 36:43.840]  the headline and said it's good to burn things down.
[36:43.840 --> 36:51.240]  Folks, if I said as a radio broadcaster or TV host, go out and burn things down in an
[36:51.240 --> 36:58.760]  offensive way, I would be arrested and I should be arrested.
[36:58.760 --> 37:05.360]  But see, I would be arrested, but I don't do it.
[37:05.360 --> 37:08.160]  I don't not do it because I would be arrested.
[37:08.160 --> 37:13.640]  I don't do it because I don't randomly just go attack something that has nothing to do
[37:13.640 --> 37:20.040]  with who's attacked me like a mindless idiot, because a bunch of Democratic Party trust
[37:20.040 --> 37:26.320]  fund rich kids come out and walk around in front of cops saying deck the halls with dead
[37:26.320 --> 37:27.320]  cops.
[37:27.320 --> 37:33.920]  Let me tell you, cop or no cop, somebody walks around in front of me and says I'm going
[37:33.920 --> 37:34.920]  to kill you.
[37:34.920 --> 37:38.080]  I'm going to knock your teeth out and I'm going to end up.
[37:38.080 --> 37:42.640]  Nobody's going to jail, but nobody's going to indict me because that's a provocation
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.400]  going around saying you're going to kill somebody.
[37:46.400 --> 37:50.800]  If we had police going around talking about they're going to deck the halls with dead
[37:50.800 --> 37:57.640]  citizens, I'd make a big issue out of it.
[37:57.640 --> 38:02.880]  When the police under Homeland Security, the national police force, the DHS ordered
[38:02.880 --> 38:08.760]  two and a half million dollars a couple years ago of no hesitation targets of men, women
[38:08.760 --> 38:09.760]  and children.
[38:09.760 --> 38:12.360]  I made a big deal out of that.
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.120]  That you could debate one way or the other because they had guns in their hands.
[38:16.120 --> 38:23.840]  This is people all over time magazine, MSNBC, the White House, the Justice Department giving
[38:23.840 --> 38:25.200]  grants out.
[38:25.200 --> 38:27.200]  This is so clear.
[38:27.200 --> 38:29.760]  The federal government is occupied by globalists.
[38:29.760 --> 38:33.800]  It's not rhetoric, it literally is.
[38:33.800 --> 38:35.080]  So here's how it works.
[38:35.080 --> 38:36.880]  The federal government wants to take my guns.
[38:36.880 --> 38:37.880]  I'm against it.
[38:37.880 --> 38:38.880]  They want open borders.
[38:38.880 --> 38:39.880]  I'm against it.
[38:39.880 --> 38:40.880]  They want to shut off our power plants.
[38:40.880 --> 38:41.880]  I'm against it.
[38:41.880 --> 38:42.880]  They want to devalue our dollar.
[38:42.880 --> 38:43.880]  I'm against it.
[38:43.880 --> 38:45.440]  They want to fund al-Qaeda groups to attack Syria.
[38:45.440 --> 38:46.440]  I'm against it.
[38:46.440 --> 38:53.600]  Inelectually, I can tell you why I'm against what they're doing, but at a base level, if
[38:53.600 --> 38:58.600]  the mainstream media wants me to fight with cops and the mainstream media wants me to
[38:58.600 --> 39:02.840]  go out and shoot cops in the head, and the mainstream media that hates me and my family
[39:02.840 --> 39:07.800]  and promotes an anti-family globalist agenda is telling me that, what am I going to do?
[39:07.800 --> 39:10.280]  I'm going to come out against it.
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.480]  See, I tried to stop the federalization, the globalization of police.
[39:15.480 --> 39:17.880]  I tried to stop the armored vehicles.
[39:17.880 --> 39:24.240]  I tried to stop the shoot on site training, the instant shooting training that causes
[39:24.240 --> 39:26.000]  so many innocents to get killed.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.960]  The instinctive shooting training.
[39:28.960 --> 39:35.240]  But that was about the globalist getting in there to twist the police.
[39:35.240 --> 39:38.080]  We had some success, but we failed in many ways to do that.
[39:38.080 --> 39:41.000]  We did inform the public and the police.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.520]  The police have been the most receptive group other than the military to this information,
[39:45.520 --> 39:47.800]  because they obviously are living it.
[39:47.800 --> 39:54.660]  Now the final tool of the globalist, the final move is to start a civil war in this country
[39:54.660 --> 40:01.120]  triggered by one of the most unpopular groups in some people's eyes, city, state, county,
[40:01.120 --> 40:09.040]  federal, international police, which will cause them to go through a total conversion
[40:09.040 --> 40:11.280]  into militarization against the people.
[40:11.280 --> 40:14.160]  And then the circles complete, the new order wins.
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.640]  We have a civil war of destabilization in this country, and that's why I'm harping
[40:18.640 --> 40:27.880]  on this every single day, because if we don't stop this, this country is going to blow up
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.640]  literally and figuratively.
[40:32.640 --> 40:35.320]  This is the move, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:35.320 --> 40:37.280]  This is the Canary in the coal mine.
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.720]  Just as the head of the IMF, chief economist, told me on air, when they start trying through
[40:42.720 --> 40:50.000]  leftist media to stir up a fight with the police, and they've got little chubby wannabe
[40:50.000 --> 40:56.520]  Kim Jong-un white kids, little soft trust fund kids that are into manipulating and into
[40:56.520 --> 41:02.080]  stirring up poor people that they prey on, who they hope to abort through their Planned
[41:02.080 --> 41:10.040]  Parenthood, I mean, I watch these videos in DC and New York and Chicago and Dallas and
[41:10.040 --> 41:13.920]  LA and Missouri, St. Louis.
[41:13.920 --> 41:14.920]  We played the video earlier.
[41:14.920 --> 41:17.720]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go look at it at infowars.com.
[41:17.720 --> 41:28.080]  As a bunch of soft, 20-year-old college kids march around with bullhorns saying, kill
[41:28.080 --> 41:32.360]  the police, and they're allowed to do it.
[41:32.360 --> 41:41.840]  Another free speech ends when you call for an act of violence and try to organize it.
[41:41.840 --> 41:47.120]  It's organized crime to go out with a group of people and go around preaching violence
[41:47.120 --> 41:48.720]  against someone who hasn't attacked you.
[41:48.720 --> 41:53.840]  Listen, if somebody's assaulting you out of the blue, I don't care if they are a cop
[41:53.840 --> 41:59.400]  or they are a mugger or they are a space alien from Mars.
[41:59.400 --> 42:01.600]  Somebody shows up, tries to kill you for no reason.
[42:01.600 --> 42:02.600]  Change yourself.
[42:02.600 --> 42:04.960]  That's defensible under law.
[42:04.960 --> 42:13.440]  But let me tell you, I get chills when I think about how bold this so-called government is
[42:13.440 --> 42:18.280]  at the federal level, the people running the federal government.
[42:18.280 --> 42:20.880]  Most people in the federal government, I've talked to or freaked out and don't like what's
[42:20.880 --> 42:24.760]  happening, so let's just not even say federal government, the occupiers of the seats of power
[42:24.760 --> 42:38.200]  in the federal government, have got the huevos rancheros, the flaming eggs who openly try
[42:38.200 --> 42:42.120]  to start a civil war and a race war in this country.
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.080]  And they are pouring it on heavy, ladies and gentlemen, because it's all they've got to
[42:46.080 --> 42:50.360]  distract us while foreign banks and Congress has passed a law to sign us all on to the
[42:50.360 --> 42:51.360]  derivatives.
[42:51.360 --> 42:55.200]  I mean, they're getting ready to loot this country just like they've done Europe, and
[42:55.200 --> 42:56.720]  they want to distract us.
[42:56.720 --> 43:01.360]  More news coming up in your phone calls will give the number out.
[43:01.360 --> 43:05.040]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[43:05.040 --> 43:09.400]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[43:09.400 --> 43:11.400]  Can you put two and two together?
[43:11.400 --> 43:17.000]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308 sniper rounds, is reasonably
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.040]  priced and fully legal.
[43:19.040 --> 43:27.080]  For how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor dot com.

[43:59.720 --> 44:06.680]  2015 is almost here, and with it comes those New Year's resolutions to finally transform
[44:06.680 --> 44:08.560]  your body the way you want it.
[44:08.560 --> 44:12.520]  There's a reason over 88% of New Year's resolutions fail.
[44:12.520 --> 44:14.040]  Make this year different.
[44:14.040 --> 44:18.920]  By equipping yourself with oxypowder, the next level in cleansing the body naturally,
[44:18.920 --> 44:24.160]  using super oxygenation, oxypowder, available through InfoWarsLife.com, gently cleanses
[44:24.160 --> 44:27.040]  the body while you sleep with easy capsules.
[44:27.040 --> 44:31.640]  Tens of thousands of individuals have used oxypowder to cleanse their bodies and aid
[44:31.640 --> 44:33.280]  in their transformations.
[44:33.280 --> 44:38.000]  Even InfoWars Nightly News Director Rob Dew has been using oxypowder with incredible
[44:38.000 --> 44:39.000]  success.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.120]  Took it that first day, and that took it for six more days after that, 12 pounds melted
[44:42.120 --> 44:43.120]  off.
[44:43.120 --> 44:44.120]  We've got, say, a week.
[44:44.120 --> 44:45.120]  Seven days.
[44:45.120 --> 44:46.920]  2015 can be different.
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.080]  Diet and exercise are important, but a lot of us have already tried that.
[44:50.080 --> 44:52.400]  Oxypowder flushes it out.
[44:52.400 --> 45:00.680]  Secure your oxypowder at inforcelife.com, that's inforcelife.com or 888-253-3139.
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.480]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming
[45:05.480 --> 45:10.120]  more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[45:10.120 --> 45:14.200]  Outdoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[45:14.200 --> 45:19.080]  than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic
[45:19.080 --> 45:20.600]  chemicals within their homes.
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.520]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic
[45:31.520 --> 45:32.520]  to as well.
[45:32.520 --> 45:36.640]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[45:36.640 --> 45:41.640]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight
[45:41.640 --> 45:42.640]  back against.

[47:03.880 --> 47:12.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:12.520 --> 47:22.520]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[47:22.520 --> 47:37.320]  The Asian-Pacific partnership is openly being signed on to our government and others but
[47:37.320 --> 47:46.040]  the details of the secret treaty are just that secret.
[47:46.040 --> 47:51.800]  We're being signed on to hundreds and hundreds of trillions of new dollars every year of
[47:51.800 --> 47:56.200]  new fake counterfeit derivatives.
[47:56.200 --> 48:01.680]  Our educational standards are plunging, our health is plunging, every indicator shows
[48:01.680 --> 48:08.520]  we are a sick nation, a decadent nation.
[48:08.520 --> 48:15.080]  We've had it good so long that the rot is really setting in, we become decadent.
[48:15.080 --> 48:21.640]  And I don't say that to be negative, I say that so we can be honest about what we become.
[48:21.640 --> 48:26.360]  So that we can shut about changing it.
[48:26.360 --> 48:31.200]  And look at these headlines, a federal judge in Arizona ruled that the state must allow
[48:31.200 --> 48:38.360]  thousands of illegal immigrants to obtain driver's license, can apply for licenses as
[48:38.360 --> 48:39.360]  soon as Monday.
[48:39.360 --> 48:41.640]  That's just the end of the country.
[48:41.640 --> 48:44.640]  You can come in, you can get a license, you can get free welfare, you can have any fake
[48:44.640 --> 48:47.720]  ID you want, any new identity you want.
[48:47.720 --> 48:50.440]  It's a joke.
[48:50.440 --> 48:56.960]  Half of all children will be autistic by 2025, warrants senior research scientist at MIT.
[48:56.960 --> 49:03.480]  Number of adverse reactions from vaccines can be correlated with autism.
[49:03.480 --> 49:12.240]  Article of Natural Health USA that links to the mainline studies, very powerful article.
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.960]  U.S. Supreme Court rules 8 to 1 that citizens have no protection against Fourth Amendment
[49:16.960 --> 49:23.080]  violations by police officers ignorant of the law, warns against allowing government
[49:23.080 --> 49:27.640]  agents to benefit from their mistakes, and to blow the constitutional rights of citizens,
[49:27.640 --> 49:33.080]  the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8 to 1 in Helen versus the state of North Carolina that police
[49:33.080 --> 49:37.260]  officers are permitted to violate American citizen's Fourth Amendment rights if the violation
[49:37.260 --> 49:42.080]  results from a reasonable mistake about the law on the part of the officer.
[49:42.080 --> 49:45.720]  And what do you think destabilization of the country and cops randomly being killed is
[49:45.720 --> 49:46.720]  going to do?
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.000]  It's going to have courts give wider leeway and a bigger eroding of the Bill of Rights
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.720]  and Constitution, which will end up hurting everybody, including police officers who the
[49:57.720 --> 50:01.560]  globalists are greedily eyeing your pension funds right now.
[50:01.560 --> 50:08.280]  And in the new funding package, spending bill that just passed, not just a law to sign us
[50:08.280 --> 50:14.760]  on to all derivatives like FDIC but make you pay for people's derivatives in a new round
[50:14.760 --> 50:20.640]  ahead of the next collapse, but also so they can take private pension funds to protect
[50:20.640 --> 50:23.800]  them, of course, but the government's going to take part of it.
[50:23.800 --> 50:27.920]  So it's not just public pension funds that are up on the block here.
[50:27.920 --> 50:33.000]  This is the planned destruction of middle class and it's nearing its final stages right
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.320]  now.
[50:34.320 --> 50:45.320]  Meanwhile, there's this nightmare headline up on infowars.com CNN ORC poll Bush, that's
[50:45.320 --> 50:52.200]  Jeb Bush, surges 2016 GOP front runner Jeb Bush is the clear Republican presidential
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.800]  front runner surging to the front of the potential GOP pack following his announcement that he's
[50:56.800 --> 51:01.480]  actively exploring a bid a new CNN poll found.
[51:01.480 --> 51:08.480]  He takes nearly a quarter, 23% of Republican surveyed in the new nationwide poll.
[51:08.480 --> 51:09.680]  Talk about vomitus.
[51:09.680 --> 51:17.240]  What we need is not more country club, blue blood, rhino, Republicans.
[51:17.240 --> 51:23.160]  Remember the Bush's vacation with the Clintons and call themselves family and the Bush's
[51:23.160 --> 51:29.800]  were for gun control Bush senior supported all sorts of gun control Bush, Jr. supported
[51:29.800 --> 51:31.280]  the assault weapons ban.
[51:31.280 --> 51:33.200]  This is why we're in so much trouble.
[51:33.200 --> 51:34.200]  And here's the new poll.
[51:34.200 --> 51:37.800]  Clinton gets 66% of moron Democratic voters.
[51:37.800 --> 51:43.160]  I mean, total morons scum of the earth when it comes to mental acuity and understanding
[51:43.160 --> 51:44.160]  things.
[51:44.160 --> 51:45.680]  I mean, Hillary is pure gangster, pure evil.
[51:45.680 --> 51:52.800]  So you got to hand it to Republicans at least only 23% support Jeb.
[51:52.800 --> 51:57.960]  Hillary, it is a whopping 60% and who cares if she's a criminal gangster involved in
[51:57.960 --> 52:03.440]  all sorts of corruption, she's a woman, so don't criticize her or you're a sexist and
[52:03.440 --> 52:04.440]  support Obamacare.
[52:04.440 --> 52:07.960]  You're a racist and turn your guns and you're a racist.
[52:07.960 --> 52:09.280]  Clinton gets 66%.
[52:09.280 --> 52:16.480]  I'm going to throw up Warren, the senator gets 9% Biden, eight Sanders, three Cuomo one
[52:16.480 --> 52:24.560]  O'Malley one Web one Patrick Z zero point five.
[52:24.560 --> 52:31.200]  And then I've got the numbers here on the Republican field and the CNN poll.
[52:31.200 --> 52:40.520]  Jeb Bush, 23% Chris Christie, a gun grabbing open borders promoting job of the hut creature
[52:40.520 --> 52:42.640]  20.
[52:42.640 --> 52:50.440]  So Jeb gets 23 Christie gets 13 Carson gets seven Huckabee six Rand Paul six Rubio five
[52:50.440 --> 52:54.520]  Ryan five Cruz for, you know, I've seen the
[52:54.520 --> 53:01.640]  the, the Gallup polls and the New Hampshire polls and the Mason Dixon polls and the Zogby
[53:01.640 --> 53:17.560]  polls, all of them have and the CPAC vote, all of them have Rand Paul at the front.
[53:17.560 --> 53:22.160]  All of them have Cruz number two.
[53:22.160 --> 53:27.360]  And then people like Chris Christie, number three and Rubio so on.
[53:27.360 --> 53:36.800]  So this poll is 100% in the opposite direction basically of all the other polls, truly disgusting
[53:36.800 --> 53:40.720]  from the establishment media that has almost no viewers is on the verge of collapse because
[53:40.720 --> 53:47.200]  of their line that Jeb Bush has 23% and that Hillary has 66.
[53:47.200 --> 53:52.040]  Does anyone believe that there's major think tank numbers and focus group numbers
[53:52.040 --> 53:58.000]  out from the left showing in the last year that Hillary is incredibly unpopular.
[53:58.000 --> 54:03.280]  The problem is she controls the money machine of the Democratic Party, the FBI files and
[54:03.280 --> 54:08.000]  knows where the bodies are buried and has the Republican leadership vying for her to
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.600]  get it.
[54:11.600 --> 54:13.520]  So that's a question for listeners.
[54:13.520 --> 54:18.000]  What do you think about the attempts to scapegoat the police as as many problems as we've got
[54:18.000 --> 54:26.320]  and you can certainly show bad cops all day and horrible, arrogant, bully things happening.
[54:26.320 --> 54:30.520]  But I mean, I could go find videos online of black people committing crimes.
[54:30.520 --> 54:34.200]  Does that mean all the black people are bad or I could find videos of guys with brown
[54:34.200 --> 54:35.720]  hair and blue eyes committing crimes.
[54:35.720 --> 54:39.040]  Does that mean that I'm committing a crime?
[54:39.040 --> 54:44.120]  I mean, there's so many jurisdictions so much diversity in police and the globalists want
[54:44.120 --> 54:48.880]  to get rid of that diversity in their mindsets and bring in this federalization.
[54:48.880 --> 54:51.960]  I want to discuss that with you, the listeners.
[54:51.960 --> 54:57.160]  I want to get into the latest NSA news.
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.520]  Hackers release a cash of 13,000 passwords and credit cards for PlayStation and Xbox
[55:01.520 --> 55:04.160]  and Amazon users.
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.320]  This is all happening right as they reintroduce the Cybersecurity Act, SOPA, Syspa, Internet
[55:09.320 --> 55:12.120]  Killing, Garbage.
[55:12.120 --> 55:15.960]  It's got bipartisan support at the highest levels and Zuckerberg just met with the head
[55:15.960 --> 55:20.120]  Chinese censor to try to learn how to censor Facebook.
[55:20.120 --> 55:23.560]  I mean, this is getting scary and people ask, well, why are you on Facebook then with three
[55:23.560 --> 55:26.440]  million likes between our 10 different platforms?
[55:26.440 --> 55:28.000]  One's got about 900,000.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.080]  The rest all together is about three million folks follow us on or like us as it's called
[55:32.080 --> 55:35.560]  on Facebook because that's where the war is.
[55:35.560 --> 55:36.560]  Why am I on Twitter?
[55:36.560 --> 55:37.960]  Why am I on YouTube?
[55:37.960 --> 55:45.160]  Why am I on Boxy and Roku and Pinterest and Instagram?
[55:45.160 --> 55:51.600]  Because we're everywhere we can reach people and you have the real power as listeners to
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.080]  remember that the system doesn't want us on the hundred plus stations we're on on the
[55:56.080 --> 55:59.120]  weekend, the 170 plus weekdays.
[55:59.120 --> 56:00.880]  We're getting new affiliates every couple of days now.
[56:00.880 --> 56:02.760]  The show is exploding right now.
[56:02.760 --> 56:06.200]  But as it explodes, other stations change format or sell.
[56:06.200 --> 56:11.080]  So it's always we're falling apart and we're building at the same time.
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.600]  But think about how precious it is that people hear a real libertarian freedom based real
[56:16.600 --> 56:19.440]  analysis program.
[56:19.440 --> 56:25.400]  We're growing because of you as we swim upstream during this singularity of media where more
[56:25.400 --> 56:27.560]  competition joins every day.
[56:27.560 --> 56:32.840]  And just as we rose with the rise of alternative media, we now face more quote competition
[56:32.840 --> 56:38.920]  than ever of a full spectrum of news analysis and quite frankly garbage as well, but some
[56:38.920 --> 56:40.080]  really good stuff.
[56:40.080 --> 56:44.400]  And I don't worry about good media that I see as accurate and freedom based with the
[56:44.400 --> 56:45.920]  bias of telling the truth.
[56:45.920 --> 56:49.800]  I'm not in competition with that, but man, we're in competition with just soft porn
[56:49.800 --> 56:53.560]  and mindless sports everywhere and all the rest of it.
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.160]  So more than ever, if you want to reach out to people, they're ready to wake up and ready
[56:57.160 --> 56:58.280]  to hear the truth.

[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.360]  hear this this is exactly what Obama promised in his 2008 campaign promise about we need
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.480]  a million man civilian police forces well equipped and as well funded as the U.S. military
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.600]  together with that and the billions of rounds of ammunition they bought together with the
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.680]  global destabilization of the economy the one world government that's coming it's like
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.600]  the antichrist man and the four blood moons that are coming this is all science there
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:38.280]  are going to be some incredibly bad things that are going to happen in 2015 and people
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.360]  better get ready well there's no doubt that the people running Obama are trying to bring
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.240]  the country down and I say it because it really happens a police officer I was out of the
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:52.840]  store today walked over who was a listener started talking to me and we're talking about
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.160]  the dead cops in New York and the destabilization and how he was just talking about how yeah
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.840]  the folks on the force all know that it's a federal destabilization program and I looked
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:06.320]  at him and I said yeah I get chills and I had this big chill and I said another one when
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:12.040]  I think about the people that are in control are really evil it'd be like if we lived in
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:17.100]  Nazi Germany in 1935 before Hitler really started getting going but you could feel the
[01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:24.160]  chill Germans talked about it that we're aware and I can feel the chill can you imagine if
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.000]  they're already doing this what else is Obama going to pull the next two years when he's
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  green-lighted by John Boehner Mitch McConnell and all these neocons to do heaven knows what
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.920]  we're in deep trouble Alex and you know on top of everything else I just heard a couple
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.560]  of days ago that in the Wall Street Journal maybe you can research and see that the Obama
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:54.560]  administration is seeking to ban Christmas lights and the common period ends December
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.320]  30th can you believe that I mean this is the most you know he God blesses ask God to bless
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.560]  Planned Parenthood and yet and then turns around and it's just crazy what's going on
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.800]  Alex it's biblical man that's because they have to train us that they can do absurd things
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.440]  and then when they say jump we say hi it is biblical since you mentioned it here's that
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.360]  clip of Obama and his domestic security force just as big and just as strong as the military
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:27.400]  and that's humbling security now with their neighborhood community organizers to get federal
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:33.720]  funds who then go out and stir stuff up and spy on people that's their humant or human
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:40.320]  intelligence here it is we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.040]  the national security objectives that we've set we've got to have a civilian national
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:51.440]  security force that's just as powerful just as strong just as well funded here's the message
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:57.320]  is being sent the border's been broken the illegals have been legalized by fiat Obama's
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.040]  operating as a dictator who in their right mind thinks that they're not going to try
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.960]  to totally take over the next two years and that they're not going to drop the hammer
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.960]  and false flag and blame us for terror attacks I mean TV shows movies video games they're
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.800]  priming the pump that the patriot is the person to look out for because the patriot knows
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.760]  who the enemy is that's right they're scared of the righteous and they're scared of the
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.800]  freedom loving Americans and I say Alex God bless you God bless your show God bless all
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:36.480]  the patriotic American loving listeners we've got to stand up and we cannot let this we
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.000]  cannot let this go any further I agree and I mean here's the deal we got to be peaceful
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.400]  about it because that's what they're looking for is violence we got to be very aggressive
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.160]  in the info war and people've got to come to grips with how much trouble we're in and

[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:27.520]  completely and totally transparent on every front regardless of what you think of some
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:32.880]  out of control police or bad police tactics that come from the federal government in most
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:40.360]  cases it's an attempt to start several unrest in the country and scapegoat one of the most
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:48.520]  visible groups in government they know that congress has a 7% approval rating they know
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:53.920]  that 80% percent of americans on average are against obama care now they know you're awake
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:02.880]  to the screw jobs so they want to scapegoat the low league enforcer at least the police
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:07.760]  have to go out in traffic and write the tickets and raise the money even though i can't stand
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:13.000]  it know it's most cases a bunch of garbage at least they have to go to the civil unrest
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  at least they have to go to the domestic disputes that are so dangerous at least they're out
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.680]  there in the real world compared to these bureaucrats that work for foreign banks that
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:32.760]  are screwing everyone over again i don't lionize the police i don't romanticize it
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.080]  but having a war with them is exactly what the social engineers want they don't care
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:43.840]  if citizens get killed and cops get killed they love it how about we kill bad ideas like
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:51.560]  the private federal reserve or obama care how about we kill obama care legal and lawful
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.840]  repeal it that should be what people are marching on the streets about that giant screw job
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.360]  written by foreign offshore companies to raise taxes on poor people and double and triple
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:07.080]  prices how about we repeal gun control in chicago in new york and dc where it's been
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:13.800]  repealed for five years in fact i saw an article on town hall where tens of thousands marched
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.920]  first it was a thousand and tens of thousands marched with their guns openly in dc a huge
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:24.760]  event i forgot to cover it that's what we're looking for there the open exercise of rights
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:32.680]  not gangster rap openly funded by the justice department this is in the news today one week
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:42.840]  before these cops got killed glorifying killing new york police it's just that's a way to
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:49.440]  destroy any opposition we need well spoken constitutionally based opposition to the globalization
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.280]  of our police and then being taken over but if we can be tricked into fighting them they
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.800]  will then run to the globalist and the new world order wins i mean this is such a simple
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.480]  equation jt coyote i believe that's who it is calling from colorado hadn't called in
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:08.440]  a while an occasional writer from full wars dot com and shooting magazines is that you
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:16.600]  t it is me my friend jt coyote okay what's your take on all this well you know the whole
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:22.720]  divide and conquer thing happening with the furgusson riots and now this this video barrage
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:30.600]  this music video barrage that's coming out it just it's everywhere on youtube yeah there
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.040]  are hundreds of videos that i've seen the last few months by the big giant mega hip hop systems
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:42.400]  that are openly run by the globalist now going into pure cop killer mode well i don't think
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.240]  that they're going to succeed with it because there are more and more people who are hearing
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:55.280]  what you have to say and i think what folks need to do in their local communities small
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:12:04.880]  towns medium-sized towns of the cities is they need to realize that most of the people
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:11.720]  in government whether it be uh... the town councils uh... city councils governors whatever
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.920]  uh... or their underlings and the cops
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.760]  their brainwashed by the mainstream media that's their compartmentalize and their ignorant
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.640]  exactly and we need to wake them up
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.840]  you can wake them up with just
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.000]  you know walk up to them and put your hand on their shoulder and
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.680]  say uh... you know i think you might be wrong on this point and here's why
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.280]  and and well you're certainly not going to want an argument shooting him in the head
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.560]  for no reason and and and and i mean
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:45.880]  look listen it's clear the justice department is lighting this fire
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.280]  did the same people that ship tens of thousands of guns into mexico to destabilize that country
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.080]  and blame the second amendment this is a false flag period
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.840]  it's not just me jt
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.760]  it's you it's many others common sense people can see what's going on
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.760]  do you think they'll be successful kick in the shop because they are in full
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.560]  press right now
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:11.560]  well they're pushing hard and it's kind of like that that infamous hail mary
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:16.140]  uh... i don't think it's going to work too many people away
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.680]  also alex
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:19.080]  tell rob
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.160]  tell do
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:23.320]  that we got snow up here
[01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.680]  from heaven
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:28.560]  and uh... did you go out and get his butt up here
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.000]  well i hear you know al gore says that the more snow is a proof of global warming
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.760]  so just pay his carbon taxes never gonna be all right
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.720]  uh... let's talk to uh... kevin
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.920]  kevin uh... go ahead uh... you're on the air
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.280]  hi i'll uh... call about any hope uh... basically my take on it is i live
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.400]  about fifty miles from newtown
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.320]  and the whole thing is pretty much the next step in reality tv
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.560]  because with other false flags like nine eleven or oklahoma city or the
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.680]  boston bombing
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.360]  at least something happened
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.760]  with tandy hoax there's no there
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.200]  there you've got a bunch of people walking around a parking lot pretty much
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.440]  what it comes down to and not only i don't know i've had the investigators on
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.440]  i've had
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.040]  the state police have gone public you name it it the whole thing is a giant
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.160]  hoax
[01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:19.640]  and the problem is how do you get deal with the total hoax i mean just
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.440]  how do you even convince the public something's a total hoax
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.320]  very hard because you know anytime i talk about this issue with people
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.160]  you know they you get criticized blackball ridicule call every name in
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:35.720]  the book or they respond with the magic words they were saying on tv
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.440]  there's no statement more proof positive of somebody who's been brainwashed by
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.000]  that stuff mainstream media than those words they were saying on tv well i
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.040]  always tell people the same thing go out and prove the official story
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.480]  and there's and i knew that millisecond this happened
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.920]  with that it now fake picture the kids being what i have a school
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:57.400]  that this there's nothing that's going to sell this agenda like dead elementary
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:00.360]  school kids now that's right the general public doesn't know the school was
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.160]  actually closed the year before
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.640]  they don't know they've sealed it all demolished the building they don't know
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:05.520]  that
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:08.960]  uh... they have the kids going in circles and out of the building
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:13.560]  as a photo op blue screen green screens they got caught using
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:16.800]  i mean the whole thing but remember this is the same white house
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.400]  that's been caught running the fake bin laden ray's come out and been faked
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.920]  uh... it's the same
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.040]  white house that got caught
[01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:26.120]  running all these other fake events
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.880]  over and over again
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.040]  and it's the same white house
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.400]  that says i never said that you could keep your doctor when he did say you
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.280]  keep your doctor people just instinctively know
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.680]  that there's a lot of fraud going on
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.120]  uh... but it took me about a year with sandy hook to come to grips
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.640]  with the fact that the whole thing was fake
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.600]  i mean even i couldn't believe it i knew they jumped on it use the crisis
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.320]  typed it up but then i did deep research and my gosh
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.440]  it just pretty much didn't
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.440]  unbelievable stay with us

[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:05.600]  that we're slaves no we've got to stand up against this tyranny we've got a war
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:11.200]  and others we've got to say no I want to go to James I want to go to I mean we've

[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:26.280]  first off James a first-time caller in Kansas go ahead hey Alex yeah I just
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.320]  wanted to have been listening to you for a long long time and I love your your
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.240]  message keep you going man you're doing a great job and I've just heard dude
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:36.800]  great buying you know because the information now is it's lightning speed
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.840]  now because we have the information info war and I've just heard this I don't
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.320]  know it's true or not but I've heard that false flags are coming in 2015 and
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.880]  they're the way they're going to get the race wars get really stirred up if
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:53.640]  they're going to target athletes and superstars because they pretty much been
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:59.200]  using them to pass their messages to us for years and years and years so they're
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.720]  going to target them and then the police are going to in turn protect them
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.960]  people and then you know that's how they're going to try and kick off that
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:10.360]  race war and then simultaneously they're going to set off bombs in different
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.520]  cities to really blame it on Russia different countries stuff like that and
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:18.160]  just get it all going on one time I mean they're really they're grasping for
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:24.120]  straws right I don't know who told you this but look it is a false flag to have
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:30.440]  the media take a few cases and hype it up and then project it on all police try
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.160]  to create a fight between the people and the police when the feds want to then
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:38.800]  swoop in with a takeover so that's a false flag fast and furious that's a
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:44.280]  false flag so many of these operations are staged events some of them are real
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:50.360]  they just then capitalize on it but you can see the preparation for big things
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:55.840]  to happen in 2015 that's absolutely true and I agree with you I appreciate your
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:00.880]  call that's why we've just got to keep promoting basic due process bill of
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:07.520]  rights constitution you name it as the answer we need to bring back what made
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:12.760]  this country great not go down the road of abandoning our republic but what's
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:19.120]  being sold on the back of all this destabilization is oh except the future
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:23.840]  the bill of rights and constitutions old no it's not not having private property
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:28.040]  not having due process being a slave of a centralized government is what
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:31.280]  happened in every other nation throughout history we were one of the first
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:36.840]  and only countries to have the idea of due process so everybody wanted to come
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:44.640]  here so our republic 240 years old is the newest and the best and has worked
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:50.880]  the best and it's the tyrants that then attack that Kevin in Michigan first time
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:57.240]  caller as well go ahead hey I just want to say that the violence has got to
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:04.680]  stop 100% you know we need to wake up I'm awake I see through it as far as the
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.080]  police go I've got a buddy who is a police officer or was a police officer
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:14.960]  that for most of his career I mean 100% solid guy you know I there's so many
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:20.240]  stories that I've been told I mean the guy is 100% solid I stand behind the
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.800]  police there's good people and bad people out there in every walks of
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:31.040]  culture and we just need to be aware of that issue I hear your brother good to
[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:37.160]  hear from you again it's a paradox what the globalist are trying to do to the
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:43.360]  police is horrible is totalitarian and is an attempted takeover obviously any
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.920]  corrupt takeover of a government tries to then take control the police duh they're
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:52.400]  trying to focus them on gun owners veterans libertarians conservatives
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:25:03.720]  anybody that forms opposition to this progressive globalist takeover so in the
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.040]  final equation it's the fact that the Justice Department is hyping all this
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.960]  you know it's bad but then separately what the shooting two cops in the head
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.720]  do if the police choked some guy to death you know who's selling cigarettes
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.360]  illegally I mean even if you can say they were in the wrong and it looks
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.440]  pretty darn bad why is the media hyping it up and projecting it on police in
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:32.520]  general when they know the training the police have been given is leading to more
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.240]  deaths and then they point at the police they've trained to be like this and then
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:44.600]  say it's their fault what I'm getting at is this it is a cop out to to look at
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.320]  police who are the representation of the government that is there and then to
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:55.960]  say it's all their fault when above them is the power structure most of it
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.480]  offshore that is screwing us seven ways to Sunday that's when I'm they want a
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.520]  war with the police to distract from I know this is simple but I'm saying it
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:11.080]  again from all of the other things that are happening like open borders and
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:17.080]  Obama becoming a dictator and Obamacare with 20 something new taxes seven of
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.680]  them on poor people doubling tripling prices death panels death panels for
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:26.480]  veterans where a 25 year old veteran can't get surgery for cancer they're
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:33.280]  on a secret death list I mean I want to hold people responsible for that that's
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:40.440]  premeditated murdering our veterans when CPS in New York got caught taking
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:43.720]  little kids mainly black kids and testing drugs and pesticides on them
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:48.040]  till they died I made a huge issue out of that and it was CPS workers that blew
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:54.000]  the whistle on that and quite frankly if the mother one of those kids went and
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.040]  did something to people that did I'd say well I'm sorry don't indict her it's a
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.000]  crime of passion they killed you know her son seven-year-old kid they poisoned
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.040]  death I've talked about it a lot here just one example but if you're gonna do a
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.960]  crime of passion you got to go after who actually did it
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:15.400]  walk in catch your wife and dad with somebody you know you're gonna get no
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:18.360]  build folks if it's not premeditated because you're angry I'm not saying it's
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:27.560]  a good thing but it's it's evil for the Ku Klux Klan to randomly find some
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.800]  black guy walking down the street in East Texas and to pull over and drag him
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.600]  till he dies and then about two years later some black guys found an old white
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.040]  man and drug him to death the media hardly covered that well that black man
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.240]  and that white man's death were just as equally as bad and they were both killed
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:46.720]  because of their color of their skin well you don't kill cops because they're
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.000]  wearing a blue uniform I mean this is a really simple and I was shocked by some
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.120]  of my own audience criticizing me on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com in the
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:01.960]  comment sections for going hey man I'm not I'm not black you know making a
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.320]  racial issue but you know they're a lot out of control cops and you know I don't
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:13.200]  know what your deal is you know the cops need to need to watch it well let me tell
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.240]  you how to win friends and influence people it's not shooting innocent people
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:21.240]  in the head and let me tell you bad cops out there giving cops a bad name they
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.600]  need to root them out as well you see these videos of cops shooting some
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:33.280]  homeless person or whatever beating their brains out it's horrible but that's not
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.480]  the whole world that's not the only issue they're just making it a
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.760]  distraction area issue in fact I saw some of the Dallas Cowboys versus the
[01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.000]  Redskins today there was like fights every two minutes seemed it was super
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.400]  entertaining but still it's a diversion from the real world it's the same thing

[01:33:55.040 --> 01:34:02.320]  because we're under a globalist eugenics model and the only way the social
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:06.840]  engineers can win is playing us off against each other I'll be back tomorrow
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.200]  with a weekday show and I'm again to a whole bunch of other issues on the economy in 2015
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.960]  what the big threats are what the big stories are obviously it's Obamacare not
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.480]  being repealed it's continued devaluation of currencies worldwide
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:26.960]  it's food prices increasing it's all these new regulations carbon taxes going
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:34.120]  in outside of law think about how epic that is I mean I would say 15 years ago
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.000]  on air that presidents are becoming dictatorial people are like oh that's
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.280]  a conspiracy theory now it's like well the president does operate in it on his
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:50.400]  own and does whatever he wants is that okay oh yeah and I dread if they elect
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:56.240]  a Jeb Bush or Chris Christie he'll be like Obama light and they'll act as
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:00.640]  dictators with banker bailouts and derivative scams and gun control and
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.040]  conservatives will defend them so much they'll go shut up Jones George W. Bush
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.800]  hidden for the assault weapons ban then I play clips of him endorsing it I had
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.080]  people at gun shops and on the street and emails when Bush was president they
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:21.720]  were about to pass it going man I don't want you lying about our president let
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:25.200]  me tell you things have changed the average conservative out there really
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:29.800]  gets it now and understands how much trouble we're in and John Boehner and
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:33.200]  Mitch McConnell and the rest of them aren't gonna get away with it all the
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:38.280]  numbers show it not repealing Obamacare not prosecuting fast and furious not
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:43.000]  investigating Benghazi gate not stopping Obama's executive power grab or the
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.080]  open borders federal justice ruled give the illegals ID's nationwide you can
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.600]  get here here's an ID
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:58.400]  one time in a move I lost my birth certificate and stuff and then later I
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.640]  lost my ID and it took me a year of hell to get an ID it's about eight years
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:09.680]  ago not illegal you just console matricula from Mexico which they'll
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:16.040]  issue five of them to your day they've done studies the Republicans in Colorado
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:19.040]  a few years ago they decided they got five in one day one with a leader of the
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.640]  Senate went in and got five in one day under different names and you get five
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.880]  different IDs with that same thing I mean it's a joke but then oh I pull up to a
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.880]  police checkpoint that's federally funded I pulled up checkpoints repeatedly
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:38.280]  I videotaped it I go let me guess this is a federal grant yes it is license
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.920]  registration I look in the car I go you know this is unconstitutional and they
[01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.880]  just want to get you conditioned to this whatever we're just trying to do you
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:50.640]  see the highway backed up two miles is just give me the information now do I
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:58.520]  blame the person doing that yeah I do about 10% of it but I blame 90% that
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:06.880]  it's federal and it's unconstitutional see right there's the microcosm I could
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:12.640]  go to Bilderberg in England or Bilderberg in DC or Bilderberg in other parts of
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.480]  Europe Switzerland Denmark we've covered it everywhere where the global leader
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.880]  meeting in secret we couldn't get him to admit it existed 10 years ago now it's
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.720]  all over the news oh yeah global government secretly meeting yeah it's
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:31.600]  true I got to England and the police including federal and they weren't put
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.680]  on act they just loved me and they're like oh yeah we hate who's in there yeah
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.360]  we know they're the ones that shipped all our jobs to India and China yeah oh
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  yeah huh and by the way why aren't you staying at a local bed and breakfast or
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:48.520]  a local hotel rice in a chain hotel Alex we're actually trying to keep our
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:55.040]  economy going here only shopping locally and they gave us incredible intel the
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.680]  whole time we were there because I didn't show up and go I want to kill you
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.400]  pig you know it's the same thing that's why the globalists want us us against
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:10.160]  them because the police are in the same boat as we are and if we ever start
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:14.160]  telling them that they already know that it's game over folks it's like V for
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:18.080]  vendetta when they're marching on the capital and the in the military's point
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:21.160]  the guns they decide not to that happened in Romania which will chest you
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:26.080]  it's happened everywhere that's what we want we don't want them to stir us up
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.480]  into a fight that once it starts then we're like two mindless pit bulls
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.680]  killing each other we're not pit bulls we're humans we're smart enough to figure
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:41.000]  this out I want to go to Bubba Francis Corey Mark Joshua Don Chris David
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.160]  Thomas and others I want to bam bam bam get to all of them before this
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.320]  transmission ends but the reason I'm harping on this revolution situation is
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.280]  they want to create a false one that doesn't have legs you think a revolution
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.440]  about shooting innocent cops is got legs to take America back hell no and it
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.080]  comes right out of the Democratic Party and it freaks me out to know a lot of
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.480]  Democrats that aren't bad people that are just Democrats they were brought up
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:09.320]  Democrats Democratic Party didn't just be this bad I mean what a creepy scary

[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:40.440]  thanks for holding. Hey Alex how are you? I'm just trying to stop a civil war as
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:46.240]  best I can one little voice. All right listen I have a really good question to
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:50.120]  ask you on basically in my opinion Americans actually has been a post
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:55.400]  democracy and please let me explain why even though our founding fathers gave us
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:01.560]  a bill of rights and Constitution but unfortunately America has always had a
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:05.240]  special place for the New World Order they've actually controlled our money
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.640]  supply they they've actually given us eugenics basically you
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.600]  know the American industrial complex all this stuff is basically to destroy
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:18.720]  America basically even though we were prosperous at one point. It's very complex
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:24.320]  but yes there was an Illuminaughty line a Masonic line and a Christian line that
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.640]  founded America I could write ten books on the subject it's so detailed and
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:35.800]  complex but the Renaissance moved to North America and so a lot of good was
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.040]  in it but also a lot of bad people trying to claim they were part of the
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:44.000]  Renaissance and the Illuminaughty tried to hijack Masonry and Christianity
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.520]  George Washington wrote scores of letters that are online the Library of
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.000]  Congress you can read them warning of this it sounds like Alex Jones I mean
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.240]  I'm not it's incredible go read George Washington's letters it's like you're
[01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:58.200]  listening to this radio show like we ought to narrate some of them and play
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:03.440]  them on air that's a good idea and so yes I get what you're saying because
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.720]  wherever the wealth and power and freedom is so is the evil going to be
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:11.880]  there trying to surf on that you see what I'm saying yeah just remember this
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.480]  over I don't like help was actually asked it but the very government time is
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:20.320]  Jefferson actually defending it believe it or not I know that's the fact I know
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.840]  for a while Jefferson was involved in Illuminaughty it's true but but he was
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:30.520]  being the Illuminaughty would try to recruit if you read their letters the
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:35.520]  most good the most virtuous that's how they got good people to join them it
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.480]  was illumination they didn't know it was evil we know it's evil hundreds of
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:43.920]  years later it was George Washington that exposed it they were trying to take
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:47.520]  everything over I hear you a very important call we should do special
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.920]  reports on things like that I mean the Illuminaughty was founded in 1776 as
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:57.760]  well but it was founded right after our revolution launched to hijack it we'll

[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:31.400]  threatened by the fbi given to this family the other was sergeant erin
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.040]  yakey who was murdered and tortured by the fbi because he was about to blow the
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:40.280]  whistle on what they had told you well that's right good cars get persecuted a
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:44.760]  lot by the feds and the globalist those are but i mean i've interviewed don
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.520]  browning on the broadcast and you know they saw the bombs in the buildings at
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:54.560]  oklahoma city they saw it all the little clinton operation and they killed the
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.320]  cop of the year terence yakey black cop drug a bunch of folks out of the building
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:04.760]  he wouldn't shut up i've interviewed his mother i've interviewed his wife i mean
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:07.560]  that these are some groundbreaking interviews we've done and you're
[01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:11.640]  absolutely right again these are human beings and they deserve the same due
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:18.640]  process that we deserve but but i'm not even defending police it's clear the
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:22.920]  justice department is trying to start a war do you disagree with that
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:28.360]  absolutely not i i i who was in charge at the time it was it i was um eric
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:33.240]  well eric holder was the deputy attorney general exactly and in lawsuits that
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.120]  came out he covered up oklahoma city what are you gonna have what are you gonna
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.040]  have browning on again i'd be great if you could have them on again and you
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:46.640]  know we should get don browning back on and the other police that were there i
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:52.200]  mean we have the hotel receipts we know the names of the agents atf fbi and
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.960]  german intelligence that ran oklahoma city it's a lot of death threats happen a
[01:49:57.960 --> 01:50:01.520]  lot of a lot of stuff happens when we cover this that people do not like it
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.480]  obviously for a lot of reasons but i mean look look at fast and furious i mean
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:09.440]  it's just these people are horrible i mean it's it's that simple and it's not
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.920]  fun going up against them i'm not macho i'm not looking for trouble but they
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:17.920]  blew up that daycare center they did that to blame the liberty movement they're
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:22.560]  going to do it again and they're trying to start a race war my heavens we've got
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.240]  to stop it great points mark let's talk to bubba in virginia bubba thanks for
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:31.200]  holding alex there's two points i'd like to bring it real quick and i'll be a lot
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:36.240]  of here the first thing is i saw a article on breitbart about how they're
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:39.680]  going to because the illegals don't report backs now they're going to start
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:44.340]  using gps to track them so they'll come back to court i see that as a
[01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:50.760]  precursor to the future rfid implementation to everybody the second
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:55.520]  thing i'd like to bring out is the the economy of how things have changed you
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:59.400]  know slowly but surely the the frog cooking technique because back during the
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.680]  second world war the the basically with d mill a lot of the stuff and i know my
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:10.120]  grandpa and my uncles everybody do you use half tracks instead of using a
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:14.760]  tractor and so why nowadays aren't you selling the stuff back to the public too
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:17.720]  i mean they're supposedly you know so much debt and everything else not that
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:23.120]  it matters well going back to obama seven years ago stopped the sale of army
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:26.680]  surplus in fact i know a lot of folks out in the country that have tracks and
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:31.000]  things after world war two korea vietnam you name it that they would use
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:35.640]  as tractors and things and there's a big resale market for armored vehicles
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:41.800]  tens of thousands of armored cars get sold down for rich people and and feds
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:46.040]  they're privately buying them quite frankly a society degenerates it's
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:50.880]  it's here's the deal if the police said they wanted armored vehicles for the
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.600]  occasional bank robbery or hostage i'd be like okay have an armored vehicle but
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.480]  it's admittedly in all these video training seminars for the veterans and
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.480]  gun owners they believe this war is coming with us well yeah if you try to
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.360]  confiscate the guns and come after us but since they can't get the patriots to
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.920]  start a war with the police they're gonna try to get all the gangbangers to do
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:17.800]  it great points appreciate your call bubba let's talk to joshua in texas
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.480]  you're on the year go ahead yeah it's nice to take my call man i just want to
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.280]  make a quick point um i agree with what you said earlier about um if we just go
[01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.920]  around offering police officers in the street you know they're just going to
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:33.880]  turn right into the arms of the new world order and that's that's bad well
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:38.520]  that's also called cold-blooded murder of some random innocent person i mean
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.120]  it's gonna turn the police into death squads doing that back to us i mean this
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:46.760]  is insane right well i mean at the end of the day they're american citizens just
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.480]  like we are you know they've got the same rights we do and they're afforded the
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:54.120]  same opportunities secondly as a form of military police officer i served four
[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:58.360]  years in the navy as an ma i've seen both sides of the law enforcement and
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:03.400]  and the civilian side and i can i think i have a little bit of a unique
[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:08.560]  perspective on both of on on both sides of it tell us about it um well i'm the
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:13.680]  first uh first duty station i want to be able to see it and i i agree with you
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:16.840]  about the flights that are coming up missing and things like that da was
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:20.320]  rc is home of the eighth largest landings trip in the world it was used
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.640]  for uh for a backup site for the nasa shuttle missions so it really wouldn't
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:27.920]  surprise me if those planes are ending up there uh there's a lot of top secret
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:31.040]  stuff that goes on there's a lot of a lot of special forces rolling in and out
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:35.960]  of that place um but i like i said i think this whole thing being blown out of
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:39.320]  proportion i think it's the way to start a civil war and i don't agree with it
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.960]  and i i wanted to stop you know at the end of the day you know going out and
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:48.120]  killing cops and all those other stuff is not a it's not a solution to anything
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:52.120]  it's not well i mean plus look at the scum that's killing these cops
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:57.080]  they're all on welfare kill is you kill their girlfriends
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.480]  and then people are calling them heroes i mean here's the deal it's easy to get
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:03.960]  mad because i've had cops who thinks of me that are wrong over the years i grew
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:08.280]  up seeing corrupt police but i'm not stupid enough to then project that
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:11.480]  onto the average police officer some of which are my friends
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:16.200]  but when you look at the justice department trying to hype this up
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:19.400]  it really scares me because it shows they'll do anything
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.560]  this is this is so transparent
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:29.240]  it's pretty terrifying to be honest with you um like i said i just i hope uh i
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:32.280]  hope they'll collectively pull our head out of the stand and wake up and realize
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:35.240]  what's going on because the only thing that's going to save this nation and
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.840]  this world for that matter is is repenting and get out on
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:42.040]  these and begging forgiveness because unless we collectively do that as a
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:46.760]  planet and as a country this isn't going to stop
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.480]  absolutely you're absolutely right i know this if libertarians or conservatives
[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:55.000]  talked about killing cops we'd be arrested
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.880]  why is this allowed clearly people planning criminal activity all over the
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.640]  internet and nothing's done i'll tell you
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.880]  because when they're done starting a civil war they're going to censor
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:08.280]  everybody and they're going to censor protected speech next
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:13.080]  well the second point i'd like to make was um was this um
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:18.200]  as you know part of my job i would i would stand gate guard and uh
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:21.400]  i would control who came in and i had access to the base
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:25.160]  and uh if i were to just open up the floodgates and let whoever wanted to
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.560]  come in just come in and gossip there's something
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:30.920]  happen to them like they plan an ied in a car and blow up a strategic
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:34.520]  military target or blow up base housing or something like that uh
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:39.240]  something like that um i would have been brought up on charges of treason
[01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:42.520]  sedition aiding and abetting the enemy article 34
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.680]  dereliction of duty all kinds of stuff now my question is
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:50.920]  since obama's opened up the borders why isn't he answering for any of this
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:54.520]  because people have already been killed on his watch by illegal immigrants
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:57.960]  uh spellings that he's released they're killed every hour i mean there's an
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.400]  illegal alien crime wave because the criminals of latin america and the
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:04.840]  world are pouring in because they can get new identities here
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:09.480]  and exactly exactly it is over the top
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:13.960]  and so yeah go ahead answering for it why why hasn't anything been done why
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:16.600]  haven't the joint chiefs of staff done anything why haven't congress done
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:19.480]  anything i mean because they're scared in their
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:24.200]  blackmailed i appreciate your call great caller great points
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:28.360]  it's because so much has been gotten away with the sky's down the limit and so i
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.320]  asked the question we'll talk about it more tomorrow on the weekday show 11
[01:56:31.320 --> 01:56:35.160]  2 central if they've gotten away with this what's
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:41.720]  next it's just there's no end let's go to don in
