[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:25.000 --> 00:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, things are really getting crazy.
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  Turkey has been threatening to launch an Islamic caliphate across Western Europe,
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  and into Central Asia, Turkey believes they now run the Middle East basically,
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  or relaunching the Ottoman Empire that was based there for more than 500 years.
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  And of course, Turkey's capital, Istanbul, was Constantinople.
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  So they know all about usurping Europe and the fall of Rome's Eastern Empire,
[01:16.000 --> 01:20.000]  long after the fall of Rome itself in 410.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  And they have set up political parties inside Europe that even Germany has outlawed,
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.000]  because you've got some countries that are 10%, 15%, 20% Muslim.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  Turkey then organizes them to vote as the Turkish dictator tells them to.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  So it's amazing.
[01:42.000 --> 01:54.000]  And now they threatened last year and this year to, quote, burn down Europe if they didn't do what Erdogan said, Erdogan.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  And then if they didn't let more refugees in so they'd have a bigger voting block,
[01:58.000 --> 02:05.000]  let more of us in, let the Turkish government direct these groups,
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  or we'll flood you with more people and order them to burn Europe down.
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  Those are statements from his deputy minister from the Turkish government.
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  Turkey's going the way of radical Islam.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  It's been playing nice for decades to get into Europe's business,
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  but the burkas are going back on the women, the gays are getting thrown out the buildings,
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.000]  the sexual mutilization, mutilization, mutilation of little girls is expanding.
[02:36.000 --> 02:38.000]  All of it's happening.
[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  And they're saying we'll flood you, we'll flood you if you don't submit to us.
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  And now Turkey recalls its ambassadors from Israel and the United States.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  That's been reported on by Al Jazeera and by Reuters.
[02:53.000 --> 03:03.000]  Turkey recalls ambassadors from US Israel after over 50 Palestinians killed in Gaza genocide to use their words.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  Well, genocide would be the extermination or the attempt at extermination of entire group of people.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  Last time I checked there is a billion, 300 million Muslims, most of them Arabs,
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  and it's expanding by the millisecond.
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  And they're saying you will accept our religion or it's over for you.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  That sounds like genocide to me of Christians.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  But regardless, I'm sad the Palestinians got killed.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  Now, what about the millions of people killed in the Arab Spring by Muslims taking over?
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  Oh, we don't humanize them.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  Turkey doesn't walk out over that stuff because they helped run the whole thing with Hillary and Obama.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  And now that his little precious caliphate is in trouble,
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  Erdogan, this lunatic maniac who had a bunch of his security people beat up Christians protesting at their embassy in D.C.
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  Oh, you're a couple hundred Christians, Armenians protesting.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  Turkey's ongoing abuse of Christians and others.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  You're across the street of the park.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  Here, let's let 50 security guys come across and beat you up and even hit police.
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  And then the charges were all dropped on them last time I checked a few weeks ago.
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  Remember that dramatic footage of the Turkish security people beating up American citizens in D.C.?
[04:24.000 --> 04:32.000]  Meanwhile, there are hundreds and hundreds of Americans held for no reason in rotting Turkish jails.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  And Turkey doesn't care.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  So now they've withdrawn their people out of the U.S. and Israel.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  That's a sign of war.
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.000]  We're already at war with radical Islam.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  And the main head of it is an Iran.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Iran wants to be in first place.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  So does Saudi Arabia.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  No, it's Turkey.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  Because they've been working with the last of them and given advanced weapons and training.
[04:57.000 --> 05:24.000]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by InfoWarsLife.

[06:16.000 --> 06:34.000]  From the front lines of the InfoWars.
[06:34.000 --> 06:41.000]  You know, I was thinking in the middle of the night, I woke up at about 2 a.m. last night.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  And I went in to the bedroom where my wife was sleeping.
[06:48.000 --> 06:54.000]  I was sleeping in the guest bedroom because she still got the baby in the main bedroom with her.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  And I snore.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  And there's studies out there that show couples actually get along a lot better that can sleep in separate rooms.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  So yes, I sleep in a separate room for my wife most nights.
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  A lot of nights I go and get in bed weather.
[07:07.000 --> 07:17.000]  But I go in there and she's got our one-year-old daughter curled up so cute right next to her like a little puppy.
[07:17.000 --> 07:23.000]  And I just looked at them in the light, a little bit of light coming through the window.
[07:23.000 --> 07:25.000]  They were so innocent. They were so good.
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  And I just wanted to protect them.
[07:29.000 --> 07:37.000]  And I had this gnawing feeling that I'm not doing enough to do that.
[07:37.000 --> 07:44.000]  How do I protect my children?
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  When we have been born into this experiment.
[07:50.000 --> 08:08.000]  And when we know the technocrats have established a planetary program of testing toxins and poisons and compounds and electromagnetic radiation,
[08:08.000 --> 08:18.000]  cultural poisoning, genetic manipulation, basically slow death.
[08:18.000 --> 08:27.000]  And then I thought, am I guilty for bringing a child into the world?
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  And that's a debate that a lot of parents have obviously who are informed.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  And the answer is no.
[08:33.000 --> 08:44.000]  Because the globalists want to make the world so ugly and so poisonous and so carcinogenic and so twisted
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  that we give up on humanity and plug in to the matrix.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  That is their transhumanist goal.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  I've studied them.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  I've studied their programs.
[08:55.000 --> 08:57.000]  I've studied their operations.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  I've studied their own admissions.
[08:59.000 --> 09:11.000]  And that's 1,000% what we're facing.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Harrison Smith was over at my house this weekend.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  One of our crew members, camera guy, great editor, great researcher of our great crew.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  And I was talking about Brave New World.
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  This is a sidebar and how it's a real battle plan.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  And he said, you know, it's amazing.
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  I recently reread that.
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  And it's exactly what they're currently doing.
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  Sexualizing children, putting chemicals in the food and water to poison the population.
[09:43.000 --> 09:52.000]  Massive social engineering, ugly architecture, holding up twisted, weak, lazy people as gods.
[09:52.000 --> 09:58.000]  He goes, how could he get it so right in 1932?
[09:58.000 --> 10:02.000]  Well, it's not that he guessed what was going to happen.
[10:02.000 --> 10:07.000]  This is what he and his family were planning on doing.
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.000]  And again, it's not like that's my opinion.
[10:12.000 --> 10:23.000]  99% of the time, what I cover is what the globalists have said.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  And the globalists want a political system of global control.
[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  But what they really are is transhumanist.
[10:32.000 --> 10:39.000]  And they're not transhumanist in, oh, I'm going to get a better hearing aids or I'm going to get, you know, a brain shift so I don't have seizures.
[10:39.000 --> 10:49.000]  Transhumanists are taking control of human evolution in their words and building something completely new and everybody else better get out of the way.
[10:49.000 --> 11:01.000]  They're like the equivalent of aliens that landed, took control of the governments and the infrastructures and are now taking control of the entire system.
[11:01.000 --> 11:10.000]  And that is a fact, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:10.000 --> 11:21.000]  So that said, I want to be positive here because nationalism is exploding.
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.000]  The support for capitalism is exploding.
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  People realize Christianity is under attack, so it's seeing a resurgence in many areas.
[11:31.000 --> 11:49.000]  I understand the family is important and people are discovering how unelected authoritarian and alien to our current system that's pro-human.
[11:49.000 --> 12:00.000]  They are discovering just how bad this world globalist cosmology is.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  I mean, in 1932, I can hardly read Raven New World again.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  I read it again about 10 years ago.
[12:07.000 --> 12:08.000]  I read it in college.
[12:08.000 --> 12:09.000]  I read it in high school.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  I've read it three times.
[12:10.000 --> 12:29.000]  And it's written from such a sickening, elitist perspective that when you read something that's almost 100 years old.
[12:29.000 --> 12:37.000]  And you see how they charted it all and how they've got it so close now.
[12:37.000 --> 12:49.000]  It really is beyond frustrating because we could really beat this easily if adults decided to care or get involved.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  But the first thing mainstream media does is they make a joke.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  I'm saying, hey, they're creating animal human clones.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  Hey, this toxic waste is screwing up the life forms, including humans.
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  Hey, glyphosates cause breast cancer to go up 3,000 plus percent.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  Hey, smart phones and social media is causing massive depression and suicides.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  They even admit it.
[13:13.000 --> 13:22.000]  But when I would cover it first, they would inoculate people psychologically by demonizing me, making a joke out of it, so that now it's all being admitted.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  People are already so hooked.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  They've been given the advisory.
[13:27.000 --> 13:35.000]  They've been now given the warning on the cigarette package 100 years after they knew it was giving people lung cancer.
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  And they knew when they deployed cell phones, it was giving you brain tumors.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  And now they're just upping the power.
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  They know every stinking bed of it and it's all being done by design.
[13:49.000 --> 13:56.000]  And if you really read deeply, all these tech giant heads live out in the middle of the countryside with no Wi-Fi.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  They've got hardened houses.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  It's aesthetically hidden, but they've got Faraday cages.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  Their children aren't even allowed to television or smartphones.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  And they're just waiting until this whole thing destroys the general public and turns us into mindless idiots.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  And then they're going to turn it all off again.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  This is the kill grid.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  This is Hitler's dream.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  This is the soft kill.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  This is it.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  Now, I got all the big world news we're going to cover when we come back.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  But first, we are going to discuss this.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  We're going to break this down and we're going to figure out a way to stop it together.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  We're going to do it for our children.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  They're worth it.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  And I'll tell you one big thing you can do.
[14:38.000 --> 14:43.000]  That's financially fund this operation.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  Everything I sell is something that helps people have a better life.
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.000]  This water filtration systems, the best air filtration systems, the lowest prices, the very best supplements.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  By the way, X2, I told you we only have enough to do about a run and a half left.
[14:56.000 --> 15:04.000]  We're hoping to get another supply of the Deep Earth crystals, the best source of the good halogen, the cleanest stuff out there.
[15:04.000 --> 15:07.000]  999999 pure.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  We've got about a run and a half left.
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.000]  We just got the second part of that half run in.
[15:12.000 --> 15:24.000]  I'm going to put it back on sale because I want those of you that have been on the fence to try it at 25% off at infowarstore.com or 888-253-33139.
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.000]  If you haven't tried the good halogen, they bombarded us with fluoride, chlorine, bromide, all of it because they're the bad halogens.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Look into what it does.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  Look into what bad halogens do versus the only good halogen, X2.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  There it is.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  Deep Earth crystals totally pure iodide.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Infowarstore.com, X2 is back.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  Also, 50% off the turmeric formula, bodies.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  50% off all of the toothpaste products are super blue fluoride free.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  It's all there.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  Oh, it's 45 with iodine as well.

[19:00.000 --> 19:05.000]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[19:05.000 --> 19:17.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[19:17.000 --> 19:26.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.000 --> 19:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:37.000 --> 19:51.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.000 --> 20:11.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:24.000 --> 20:46.000]  You know, I have not made a documentary, a full-length one in about six, seven years, because I've been so busy on breaking news, but I really want to make a film about Brave New World.
[20:46.000 --> 21:04.000]  Because Aldous Huxley wrote another book called Brave New World, revisited in the early 60s before he died, and admitted that his brother ran the World Eugenics Organization, ran the United Nations as the head of UNESCO, but also ran the World Transhumanist Association.
[21:04.000 --> 21:21.000]  They had a plan to end motherhood and fatherhood and create the transhumans. And that's why the one thing you can't do is, quote, say something bad about a trans person, because it's not going to be about transing your sex or some sexual fetish.
[21:21.000 --> 21:36.000]  It is going to be complete overwrite of the human genome and then saying, oh, you can't criticize that. It's hateful. That'll be the one-world religions rule.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  Designer babies, humanoids, Blade Runner for real, folks. This is the holy grail of the establishment.
[21:45.000 --> 22:04.000]  Brave New World, written in 1932, started to work on it in 1928, is not a novel. It's not fiction. It's a blueprint. It's a prospectus. It's a program. It's an operational manual.
[22:04.000 --> 22:16.000]  We'll be talking more about that because the way Harrison just looked down, he goes, it's incredible. It's real. And I'm like, yes, it is real.
[22:16.000 --> 22:24.000]  He wrote about his brother and the elite British society plan.
[22:24.000 --> 22:36.000]  And that's why the cell phones are killing us and the glyphosate is killing us and the fluoride is killing us and lowering our IQs. That's a fact. And the cell phones are making us depressed and manipulating our dopamine receptors.
[22:36.000 --> 22:45.000]  And then they even have the heads of Facebook come out and say, I'm embarrassed. We've brainwashed and brain damaged billions of people and it's getting worse.
[22:45.000 --> 23:00.000]  Now, I'm taking my five billion and running. Are they doing that because they have guilt and a conscience? Or are they doing it because metaphysically they have to tell you what they're doing? It's both.
[23:00.000 --> 23:07.000]  But it's one thing to set this stuff up because the globalists, you know, hired Sean Parker and others to build it.
[23:07.000 --> 23:17.000]  It's another thing when you're worth billions of dollars and you got kids and you become a little bit more mature.
[23:17.000 --> 23:26.000]  And you go, man, this is really uncool because where it leads is a thousand times a thousand times worse.
[23:26.000 --> 23:33.000]  I've got so much breaking news. It's just that how do I break through to people and go?
[23:33.000 --> 23:40.000]  3G in studies causes multi-thousand percent increases in tumors.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  There's now human studies confirming what they found in rats.
[23:44.000 --> 24:01.000]  Yeah, it's why we test on rats and pigs because physiologically, for whatever reason, rats and pigs physiologically operate closer to humans than the other group. Poisons, diseases, diseases we can get, rats can get.
[24:01.000 --> 24:07.000]  Same thing with pigs. We are so close when it comes to how our bodies react.
[24:07.000 --> 24:16.000]  Our DNA is not super close, but the way we react is pigs and rats.
[24:16.000 --> 24:26.000]  And in pig studies and rat studies, 3G, 4G, you might as well live inside a microwave oven. That's what it is.
[24:26.000 --> 24:37.000]  And then I was thinking, you know why this also hit me? I went down and just walked into Google to be friendly at their headquarters in downtown Austin and just to show how they'd flip out and be rude and horrible.
[24:37.000 --> 24:51.000]  You know, they pride everybody illegally spy on you and do all this. I went down there yesterday and they called the police on us and the lady came down and was, you know, rude and everything and freaking out how dare you even be here scum.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  But I just did it to illustrate it, but then when I walked out of there, I went, wait a minute.
[24:57.000 --> 25:06.000]  For people that want fast download speeds, and I'm not kissing Googles, but I'm just being honest here, everything has double-edged sword.
[25:06.000 --> 25:25.000]  For people that really want to stay away from Wi-Fi and really want to stay away from 4G and 5G and all this wireless stuff that is totally affecting us physiologically, absolutely in a detrimental way.
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  Many estimates are worse than cigarettes to be around 5G.
[25:30.000 --> 25:39.000]  Now, and that's not talking about what they do psychologically or culturally or mentally, how it depresses you. More big studies out on that I'll cover.
[25:39.000 --> 25:46.000]  But they act like we're going to be in this heavenly nirvana.
[25:46.000 --> 26:03.000]  We just plug into this matrix, but then I was thinking Google is putting in fiber everywhere. That is, we're getting here, that is so fast you can download two-hour movies and HD in like one second.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  You don't need any more than that.
[26:06.000 --> 26:14.000]  But there's no radiation coming out of the lines.
[26:14.000 --> 26:31.000]  Basically, it doesn't even register. There's some, but it's just absolutely minute compared to blasting 5G that is a big fat microwave transmitter.
[26:31.000 --> 26:37.000]  And so I was just thinking, I put in wires in my house two years ago when I moved.
[26:37.000 --> 26:46.000]  And they're coming out of every wall in the house. And it's pretty good connection.
[26:46.000 --> 26:54.000]  Wi-Fi was just put back in my house. I'm not going to even get into how it got there or what went on or any of this because of the security system.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  And then, oh, that's connected to something else. And then it's like, well, I just took the stuff out.
[27:00.000 --> 27:06.000]  I am, look, I can't sit up here and preach all this if I'm not going to do something about it. And I've told the crew.
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  Get the engineers in here. I don't care. Get the super fast cables in everywhere.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  Let's get rid of wireless in this place, man. Come on, guys.
[27:15.000 --> 27:21.000]  Yeah, we've got old, you know, lighter systems, but still it's bad.
[27:21.000 --> 27:34.000]  And that's how we're going to fix this world is addressing the real pollution, the genetic engineering, the toxic waste dumping, the electromagnetic artificial radiation, the cross species cloning.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  All of these are the threats. And the sick joke to the globalist is they've got to solve obsessed over carbon dioxide.
[27:41.000 --> 27:49.000]  That's one of the lowest levels ever recorded on this planet that plants live off of as part of the carbon cycle instead of all the thousands of things that are killing us.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  And the average leftist goes, good, there are too many people. You always hear that. Hey, moron, you think the 5G is good for everything?
[27:56.000 --> 28:05.000]  You wonder why the honeybees are all dying, why the whales are beaching, why all these thousands of species are dying? Many forests are silent now.
[28:05.000 --> 28:13.000]  Why does the soil all over the U.S. have 10 times the aluminum dioxide it had just 50 years ago? It's not even being belched out of factories anymore.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  Where is it coming from? We're being experimented on. The atmosphere is being changed.
[28:18.000 --> 28:26.000]  Something begs going on hundreds of times better than the Manhattan Project. And I've read what the globalists said they were going to build and their declassified documents.
[28:26.000 --> 28:37.000]  And we know actually what it is. And it does not appear to be human. I don't know if it's off-world, interdimensional, or these people are crazy and think they're building this thing.
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  And so there's psychotics and think that they're building this thing. But let me tell you, they were envisioning 160 years ago, silicon live forms, biometrics.
[28:45.000 --> 28:57.000]  It was the Huxleys, it was the Wedgewoods, it was the, all of them were in a cult and inner bread to create this new super machine that they're about to launch against us.
[28:57.000 --> 29:17.000]  I don't know who's running them.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  Want revenge on the common housefly?

[33:21.000 --> 33:29.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones.
[33:29.000 --> 33:38.000]  I'm going to say one more thing about how brave new world is a blueprint for total control and enslavement and human extermination in the author's own words.
[33:38.000 --> 33:46.000]  He said this is a novel based on the elites plan that is progressing a little bit behind but that we intend to carry out against you.
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  And I disagree with George R. Well that it will be a police state in the future. We'll not. We'll put ourselves in our prisons.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  We'll break up your families, drug you into oblivion, and then exterminate you.
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  THX 1138 by George Lucas, both his student film and then his feature film are adaptations of Brave New World.
[34:03.000 --> 34:10.000]  THX 1138. So you might want to research that.
[34:10.000 --> 34:17.000]  Now that's it.
[34:17.000 --> 34:26.000]  I was watching Wild Wild Country on Netflix this weekend when I was on the elliptical and I'm up to episode three.
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  And I knew about the Maharishi and you know that cult and all the other Eastern invasion cults. It's pretty bad stuff.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  Because you have these little trendy kids brought up by baby boomers and brought up by others to just think they can do whatever they want.
[34:43.000 --> 34:49.000]  And they have no discipline and then along comes this guy and says you can be as worldly and as wicked as you want.
[34:49.000 --> 34:54.000]  And because you're so ascendant, they completely buy into it.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  But when you watch it, it's the blueprint of the Democratic Party, the blueprint of Apple, the blueprint of Bezos.
[35:01.000 --> 35:12.000]  The whole thing is their blueprint. But evil has a blueprint. They didn't get their blueprint from the Maharishi.
[35:12.000 --> 35:23.000]  Evil is a system and it always sets up these hierarchical programs claiming they're not hierarchical.
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  They're always obsessed with drugging and covertly poisoning people.
[35:29.000 --> 35:35.000]  So fluoride in the water, adding lead to the gasoline when they had other formulations that were much better.
[35:35.000 --> 35:44.000]  And they would have the people go completely insane that worked in the refineries around the lead and murder rates were way, way, way, way, way higher.
[35:44.000 --> 35:56.000]  And within two years of lead being taken out of gasoline, the crime rate in this country dropped 40%. The violent crime rate.
[35:56.000 --> 36:02.000]  You know, the left one argument they have whenever I go, hey, Kinshild Kerry came in in the midnight, he's in crime drop 60%.
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.000]  Nationwide using guns, which is true.
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  And they go, yeah, but that's the same time that lead was phased completely out.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  And I go, actually it was a little bit before that, but you're right, actually.
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  Attributed around 40% of the crime drop was the lead being taken out.
[36:16.000 --> 36:25.000]  Another 21% had top professors on like John Lott and others was the guns.
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.000]  But see, time will admit this.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  That was standard oil is who pushed that.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  Even Time Magazine admit standard oil did that in 1924.
[36:36.000 --> 36:47.000]  Folks, I harp on this because I've got hundreds of news articles that are all riveting, incredibly important, amazing, absolutely must be covered.
[36:47.000 --> 36:52.000]  Turkey pulling ambassadors out, talking about war, threatened to flood Europe with more Islamists.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  That is incredibly important. What's going on in Israel?
[36:55.000 --> 36:58.000]  The deputy pope on trial for kidnapping over 100 children.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  There's a news blackout on that.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  Mueller's caught working with the Russians.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  That's mainstream news.
[37:04.000 --> 37:05.000]  Even the Hill.
[37:05.000 --> 37:06.000]  I mean, this is big.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  People attacking Melania Trump and her kidney surgery.
[37:09.000 --> 37:16.000]  I mean, you know, an off-duty female cop shooting a guy three times and killing him when he tries to kidnap kids.
[37:16.000 --> 37:21.000]  I mean, we've got a ton of stuff here.
[37:21.000 --> 37:30.000]  But why did the Maharishi poison people when he had no reason to?
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  Because it's a power trip they get off on seeing people under their control.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  And you know, he was drugging people inside the base.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  I know people that worked in the security detail.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  I remember hearing about this in Hollywood 15 years ago.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  They were sticking rattlesnakes and people's mailboxes was way worse than what you see on the TV show.
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.000]  TV show is almost pro.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  But that's what the leftist are.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  It's a cult.
[38:00.000 --> 38:08.000]  And can you imagine that they have been putting 1.6 parts per million of hydrofluorosilicic acid?
[38:08.000 --> 38:14.000]  That's souped up, amped up acid form of fluoride.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  Not calcium fluoride that you've got to have microns of or you'll be a sickly person.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  You need a little bit of arsenic as well in the environment.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  A little bit of lead.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  But super microscopic amounts.
[38:25.000 --> 38:34.000]  This is weaponized adjuvant to then activate every other toxin in your body and take it through the blood-brain barrier.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  It's only the full metal jacket fluoride to get the poison in.
[38:40.000 --> 38:49.000]  There's studies out there when they dump another fluoride-based prozac-type drug in the water supply.
[38:49.000 --> 38:50.000]  They've got studies.
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  AP, what was it, 16, 17 years ago, they had a big study.
[38:53.000 --> 39:03.000]  And they found 20 major shitties, all had levels of prozac, that was hundreds of times what runoff from sewers or from treatment plants could be.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  They're putting it in the water, folks.
[39:06.000 --> 39:12.000]  Well, you think a bunch of leftists and a bunch of leftist lawyers just went out to Oregon and put stuff in the water in the food?
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  They love it.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Their religion.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  I said 20 and 24 shitties.
[39:18.000 --> 39:23.000]  Good memory, but not good.
[39:23.000 --> 39:32.000]  And major labs looked at it and said, these aren't even Luvox or prozac molecules.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  It's like a generic one.
[39:35.000 --> 39:42.000]  And they went to other toxicologists and scientists and said, could these drugs be breaking down into something similar but simpler?
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  They went, no.
[39:44.000 --> 39:52.000]  You know how many of the water treatment facility people and how many of the private labs have had their scientists killed?
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  You know how many labs that test blood independently get murdered?
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Look at the Clinton blood scandal, folks.
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  Here's the problem.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  I could talk for a thousand hours here about it.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  They're putting chemicals directly in the water.
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.000]  They're not just putting atrazine in there.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of chemicals.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  They are mutating everybody in front of you.
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.000]  You go to the mall, everybody looks like the walking dead.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  We are being murdered systematically.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  It's all compartmentalized.
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  And let me tell you, the heads of Google, the heads of Apple,
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  the heads of Microsoft, all of them are in on it.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  And that's why they want this show shut down.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  Because they're all drinking purified water and having clean air,
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  living out in the middle of nowhere except with their own business trips, hiding their families, not letting their children have any technology.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  This is all on record.
[40:51.000 --> 40:57.000]  And they are all running to the countryside in isolated islands to watch us die.
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  And they fly in on big private jets to administer the technological takeover,
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  the capturing of the human species, the putting us into a trance,
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.000]  drugging us, mesmerizing us while they sterilize us.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  You're living in a science fiction dystopia.
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  100%.
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  The 5G, the 4G, the 3G is killing you.
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  When you're driving along your car with three, four people with cell phones on, and now the cars have wireless in them,
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  so you get the weather and everything, those are frying you inside a metal tin can.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  You're in a microwave with microwave ovens.
[41:36.000 --> 41:41.000]  Because, see, a microwave is not that powerful unless it's right up against your head.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  Then it fries the DNA and breaks the strands at point-like range.
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.000]  That's why you got that type of brain tumor itself doubling, they admit it's cell phones.
[41:48.000 --> 41:57.000]  But inside an aluminum can, that's why people sometimes take cell phones inside an aluminum case,
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  and you hear about cell phones blowing up, because it can chain reaction.
[42:02.000 --> 42:08.000]  And you're inside, as one of the engineers reminded me of this, you're inside your car with Wi-Fi and your cell phone,
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  you are in a microwave oven.
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  Now again, I believe we can turn this around, we can defeat the globalists, we can expose globalism,
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  we can learn about their system, we're having a success with Trump, he's not in on this.
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.000]  That's why the government's trying to block him from everything, so they're trying to keep him out of everything.
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  Because this plan is powerful, because it's so far-reaching, so diabolical,
[42:31.000 --> 42:34.000]  and run by only a few technocrats at the top through compartmentalization.
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.000]  But it's also very weak, because once you admit the horrible plan and are aware of it,
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  of a bunch of tax-exempt robber barons, a huge Rockefeller slash British royalty eugenics plan,
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  once you're aware of the plan, it's easy to defeat.
[42:51.000 --> 42:59.000]  But you've got to admit it's happening, and it is happening, it's public, and it's getting worse.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long, go ahead.
[43:02.000 --> 43:08.000]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  It just gets old, man.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  I mean, what's it going to take, us being shut down?
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[43:28.000 --> 43:29.000]  You know what, Alex?
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  I put him on pause again.
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  I need your help, Frank.

[43:58.000 --> 44:02.000]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.

[45:41.000 --> 45:42.000]  Absolutely.
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.000]  Because then we could all as educated patriots help our other countrymen and women
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on.
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.000]  And if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves,
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  we can take our country back.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.000]  The magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  Brainwash young people against info wars.
[46:31.000 --> 46:36.000]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[46:36.000 --> 46:39.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  It is so critical that you go to infowars.com.
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  Or slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you.
[46:47.000 --> 46:54.000]  Censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  That is critical to this fight.
[46:56.000 --> 47:18.000]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[47:26.000 --> 47:34.000]  Oh my gosh.
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.000]  You know, when I'm driving up to work in the morning or I'm up here working at night,
[47:39.000 --> 47:43.000]  I've got so many issues I want to cover and then I tend to just go back to the eugenics,
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  back to the technocracy, back to the private corporate world government,
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  that we've finally gotten to the point that the general public knows is real.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  Wow, there's big mega corporations that have set up a private tax exempt world government
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  and they're authoritarian and they're being voted out across the world.
[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  But they're dug into power. They're dug into the corporations.
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  They're dug into the big companies and they all pose as SJWs.
[48:12.000 --> 48:20.000]  Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, Tim Cook,
[48:20.000 --> 48:24.000]  George Soros, every stinking one of them.
[48:24.000 --> 48:32.000]  Oh, Hungary just threw out his foundation based where he used to help round up Jews
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  and send them to the death camps.
[48:36.000 --> 48:42.000]  And Soros openly brags on CNN that he overthrew Ukraine.
[48:42.000 --> 48:49.000]  He brags that he's trying to overthrow these countries and make them take massive Muslim immigration in.
[48:49.000 --> 48:52.000]  He brags at dayboats. He helped set that up with the UN.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  And they said, you know what, George Soros?
[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  He funds the Zodiac boats coming out of North Africa. He's on record.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  They said, no to the Soros plan. We're a Christian nation.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  And so Soros goes, they're hateful. They're being mean.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  They ran against me. I'm leaving and I'm moving to Germany.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  Yeah, I guess that gets you closer to your Nazi masters.
[49:14.000 --> 49:22.000]  I'm not bashing Germans. I'm part German. My wife, pretty much German and then some Irish.
[49:22.000 --> 49:29.000]  Not knocking the Deutsch people, but I am knocking Merkel and the EU Hitler plan.
[49:29.000 --> 49:38.000]  You know, when I say the EU was a Hitler plan, when I say Junker, his father and grandfather were the top Nazis in Germany.
[49:38.000 --> 49:49.000]  I mean, that's a historic textbook fact. When I say that the EU is unelected, that's a fact.
[49:49.000 --> 50:00.000]  When the Southern Poverty Law Center calls everybody that's pro-America Nazis or Spike Lee calls Trump a Nazi in an expletive filled interview,
[50:00.000 --> 50:12.000]  Spike Lee's the Nazi. Spike Lee's the one who is pushing total racial division constantly.
[50:12.000 --> 50:18.000]  And every time they dredge up some old wounds like the KKK, fine, make a movie about it, win awards about it, great.
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000]  But then to compare it to Trump and say he doesn't care about black people because he didn't decry the Klan.
[50:23.000 --> 50:34.000]  He said he didn't like David Duke hundreds of times, you lying, race pimping sack of garbage, Spike Lee.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  And his movies are like after school specials. They're not even that good.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.000]  That mother effer was given a chance to say we were about love and not hate.
[50:46.000 --> 50:53.000]  That's what Trump's been saying, word for word. And that mother, you know what, did not denounce that mother effing Klan,
[50:53.000 --> 50:59.000]  the alt-right and those Nazi mother effers, he said, you are a liar.
[50:59.000 --> 51:07.000]  You were picked by the corrupt evil Hollywood to be the token black guy out there instead of all the other talented black directors
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  and people that are out there to spew racial division in this country and to open up wounds.
[51:11.000 --> 51:19.000]  Why do you think there's hundreds of movies right now about whites being racist and whites being evil?
[51:19.000 --> 51:26.000]  It's to create racial division. What was going on when they were practicing for martial law during Jade Helm?
[51:26.000 --> 51:37.000]  We got the documents. Remember? The Sorosas were planning a race war in this country with blue city police departments.
[51:37.000 --> 51:45.000]  That's not a double entendre. Blue state areas to then try to get blacks to riot so Obama could declare a civil emergency.
[51:45.000 --> 51:54.000]  We have those documents. Those are public. Those are not denied.
[51:54.000 --> 52:01.000]  And that's your job.
[52:01.000 --> 52:10.000]  It's to go out there and turn around when Trump word for word says, I'm all about love. Everybody coming together and working together like he did 40 years ago,
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  opening up those golf courses and hotels that still private hotels and golf courses didn't allow blacks and Jews in them and the rest of it.
[52:17.000 --> 52:26.000]  So you don't care about the reality. You just care about shooting your mouth off at your George Soros funded deals and going to the falling apart cans film festival
[52:26.000 --> 52:34.000]  to put out your black KKK Klansman movie.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  I mean, the Klan was a complete joke by the 60s.
[52:39.000 --> 52:47.000]  Oh, Spike Lee won't make a movie about LBJ saying black people were slaves or that he was going to enslave black people.
[52:47.000 --> 52:55.000]  No, no, you won't hear any of that from the Democrats. No, no, you're only going to hear about how there's all these evil white people everywhere.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  Put out by Spike Lee, Spike Lee slams Trump as mother effort.
[53:00.000 --> 53:07.000]  After the black Klansman premiere to get some publicity.
[53:07.000 --> 53:16.000]  Does he say a word about him putting HIV in the vaccines in Africa or 50% of blacks get the border before they're born or no, he says nothing.
[53:16.000 --> 53:28.000]  He says zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  Because Spike Lee's a monster just like Maxine Waters. He knows exactly what he's doing.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  He wants to make sure black people have chips on their shoulders.
[53:35.000 --> 53:45.000]  He wants to make sure white people are so freaked out they're scared to be around black people and he wants to keep you absolutely right in the place where they can bombard you
[53:45.000 --> 53:51.000]  and control you and ship the narcotics right into your neighborhood and just set you up for prison.
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  He won't make a movie about Hillary Clinton calling black people animals.
[53:54.000 --> 54:02.000]  Dogs said keep them to heal, teach them black men to heal like dogs. He won't do a thing about that.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  Neither will Maxine Waters.
[54:06.000 --> 54:16.000]  Will he make a movie about fluoride having twice the negative effects on people of African descent than any other racial group?
[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  He won't say a word about that because he doesn't care about you.
[54:20.000 --> 54:32.000]  He just walks around with his attitude problem worth hundreds of millions of dollars trying to stir up race war in this country when there's a war on humanity going on.
[54:32.000 --> 54:38.000]  You take Brazil.
[54:38.000 --> 54:45.000]  I got a video I want to air right now shifting gears out of that.
[54:45.000 --> 54:57.000]  Every day I see another video of a woman or a man defending themselves with a criminal break soon with a gun or with a knife or with a club.
[54:57.000 --> 55:07.000]  And everywhere in the world their right to self-defense is upheld except in the UK and areas of Europe where they throw the book at you.
[55:07.000 --> 55:16.000]  But in Brazil they've got a man who's in the front running out of eight candidates to be president and he says he wants a second amendment there.
[55:16.000 --> 55:23.000]  Brazil has a very high crime rate despite they have a total gun ban.
[55:23.000 --> 55:32.000]  There's footage of a man running up, looks like trying to kidnap kids on the street aiming a gun at him and this woman, this mother, this off duty police officer,
[55:32.000 --> 55:39.000]  instantly goes into action, reaches out, triple taps him in the chest and then like a cobra strike gets behind the car.
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.000]  Does it perfectly in seconds? Boom, boom, boom, puts herself in harm's way to protect the children.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  He later died and it's powerful here.
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  There's no sound, it's a CCTV camera. Let's back this up for TV viewers, I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  Let's roll it, yeah, slow it down.
[55:57.000 --> 56:07.000]  Slow it down five times. He comes up, pulls out his revolver, starts trying to pointing at little kids, trying to drag little kids away, it looks like.
[56:07.000 --> 56:16.000]  Kidnapping's a big thing there and she reaches out and shows him with like a glock nine millimeter, three times dead center in the chest.
[56:16.000 --> 56:23.000]  And there he begins to die, beautiful. Not that I love death, not that I love killing, but I love seeing people defend themselves and take action.
[56:23.000 --> 56:32.000]  But you don't see this kind of stuff on the national news because it's the image of a woman defending children, true feminism, women being empowered,
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  not the expense of men but with everybody being empowered.
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.000]  Just have a bunch of disarmed, unhappy, bitter women clinging to Hillary Clinton like she's their pimp.
[56:42.000 --> 56:49.000]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back with the latest news on Turkey, the latest incredible news unfolding around the world.
[56:49.000 --> 56:56.000]  Turkey basically declaring war on the US and Israel and we've got so much more, we're going to go through coming up.

[57:26.000 --> 57:34.000]  And back on sale, back in stock, 25%, survival shield X2, the good allergen, 25% off, but it's going to sell out.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  I'll have to end this sale soon. We're not going to get more for a month. We're able to get a rush half shipment in.
[57:39.000 --> 57:45.000]  Now, we've completed that one shipment so the other month or so until that other shipment comes in and we're running low on the supply.

[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  I was at the inauguration with the head of Turning Point USA, actually flew back and part of the leg to Austin on the plane with him.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  And he said, oh yeah, we got big plans to reach young people, reach communities of every type.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000]  We thought I'd just bring America together.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  I know they've got Candace Owens working with them.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Now Brandon Tatum, the former SWAT officer is working with them.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  Very, very, very, very exciting as director of urban engagement with Turning Point USA.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  So I love seeing how Turning Point USA is really exploding and they're going out and they're getting the best folks from every walk of life who just want to empower this country.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  So be sure and follow Brandon Tatum at the Officer Tatum. His videos have hundreds and hundreds of millions of views.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  But then you go to his Twitter, there's hardly anybody following him.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  And that's because Twitter artificially doesn't let conservatives and libertarians and patriots and people that just want to get along promote anything.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  And we've got a big announcement on this coming up after Brandon leaves us.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  We got this from Roger Stone yesterday and I've confirmed it all now.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  And starting May 25th, all conservative advertising by political candidates, because it's not just the Alex Jones show.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  We've checked other areas will be banned.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  Facebook says they're not allowing that communication.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  So the Republican Party wants to reach out and advertise on Facebook to people on our pages.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  We wouldn't be getting any money.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  They're refusing that advertisement.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  So there is a real war going on to suppress everybody, but they can't silence at all.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  If we continue to speak up, I think they've jumped the shark, but at the Officer Tatum.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  Brandon, good to have you back with us.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Now, Brandon, this is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  And I've got a lot of questions I want to get into.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  But for you and we come back, what's front and center for you right now?
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  So right now, what I'm doing is just developing strategy and trying to get, I would say, a coalition of individuals together so that we can make an impact in the urban communities.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  One of the major things that we're trying to do is to get into HBCU's historical black colleges, develop chapters there.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  And we have a huge event that's going to that we've already planned out.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  It's already scheduled.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  People can apply for it.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  It's the Young Black Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C. in October.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  So that's kind of the main focus right now.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  What I'm doing is just trying to get that summit together and prepare young people to inspire people all across the country.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Well, I want to send a crew to cover that because we're seeing with Candace Owens and you and Trump and everybody else a double the number of black American males supporting the president.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  I mean, this shows this real engagement could break the trance the Democratic Party has on people.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Yeah, I think it definitely will.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  I've already seen it.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000]  You know, it's funny that I met a young lady who works for a very, very liberal organization.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  She happened to be African-American and me and her set in my living room and had a conversation.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  And literally, we had the exact same ideologies.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  I mean, not one thing that we discussed we differ on.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  And this is the evolution of young African-American people waking up to what the left is doing and actually trying to make it a sort of effort to come together and say,
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  What do we need to do to make the situation better as people as Americans?
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  And I mean, that's that's very exciting for me to see somebody on the opposite side actually have the same ideas.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  It's incredible.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  You know, we see though the censorship taking place ahead of the 2018 elections.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  I want to talk about that when we come back as well.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  But I would imagine I haven't ever asked this question, but I would imagine that you've probably seen some attempts to dial back what you're doing.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  Yeah, you talking about on social media?
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Yes.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  My like you mentioned the Twitter, you know, it's quite interesting that I post things on Twitter and it just seems like certain things that I say,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  I don't know if it's trigger words for Twitter.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  It's literally censored.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  YouTube is killing every video I upload is demonetized automatically.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  And I had two videos completely taken off of YouTube and then I was I'm banned from live.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  See, I knew it because everybody I talked to is happening and look, I can get a little, you know, little mean.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  I've watched your videos are as gentlemanly as it comes and that's what they're scared of.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  We'll be right back with Brandon Tatum.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  Stay with us.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from info or store.com,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  you are funding the revolution.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at info or store.com.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well in full wars life dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us stands with America stands with Trump stands against the globalist and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  So we need your support.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  You are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:27.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance from deep in the heart of FEMA region six, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:41.000]  I am Alex Jones, your host. So much is going on here at the info wars news center that I can't even keep track of half of it.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  I've had a major Republican Party individuals send me the documents from Facebook.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  It appears they intend to basically ban us or completely shadow ban us on May 24.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  When they're telling the Republican Party and others that they will no longer be able to access our public pages on Facebook that have millions and millions of likes.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  So what's happening is they're banning the Republican Party from being able to buy ads from Facebook to simply advertise voting, recruitment, events, races.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000]  This is so draconian.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  And, you know, we can make it about info wars. Since I learned about this yesterday, I made a couple of the calls and it's happening to other conservative libertarian sites.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  So this is how the media does it. They'll demonize one conservative group and make up lies about them and try to get the others to not support them.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  Then they'll talk about about this group and say, oh, don't support them.
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  And then pretty soon they ban everybody. This is here.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Now, Brandon Tatum has had videos with 60, 70, 80, 100 million views individually.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  But as soon as he exploded last year as a SWAT team, a police officer who was also moon lining, as somebody just speaking out for the First Amendment,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  suddenly he was having his videos banned, blocked. They were getting 100,000 views.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  That's what they're doing to everybody. This is draconian. It's everywhere.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  And we have Twitter employees admitting to censoring conservatives, banning them for political reasons.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  It's going on. It's happening. And even, you know, Ben Shapiro's Daily Wire talks about that.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Ben should come out against it because if we don't hang together, we're going to hang separate.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  And Brandon Tatum's here with us and I want to get into a bunch of issues with him.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]  Candace Owens and she's part of Turning Point USA and he's part of that as well.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  The director of urban engagement and the exciting things that are happening.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  But if we can't tell you about the exciting things that are happening, if we're putting an electronic ghetto, then what comes next?
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  So just recount for us the positive things that are happening,
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  what you see happening in communities all across the nation and where you see this going,
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  but also the fight to be able to continue to reach out with this message of hope and prosperity that President Trump and you and others are promoting.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  Yeah, I'm seeing a real awakening. I mean, this is not a game. This is not propaganda.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  I have communicated with people that are historically on the left and they can see that there's a need for change.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  A lot of things that I've seen or something that's major to me as far as party shift is that I think people don't look at Donald Trump as a Republican.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  People don't see Donald Trump as a politician. They see Donald Trump for who he is and what he stands for.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  And as America can see, we voted him in and he's doing exactly what he said he was going to do.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  So I think that that inspires people on both sides.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  And I've talked to people that's in LA, in the hood, and they tell me the same thing that they need to change.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  They're tired of the Democrats running their city and ruining their cities.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  Like I said, I talked to the young lady from another organization that's like Turning Point,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  and I'm not going to say the organization because I don't want to throw her out there,
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  but she's from an opposing organization, but she sees the same thing.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  We talked about Barack Obama. We talked about the problems and disenfranchisement in the black communities.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  And this is a real thing. And I think people should take it serious.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  And I think we should continue to fight and continue to post things and continue to share content on our platforms from other people who we respect.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  This show, I respect it a lot. I love it. I tell everybody about the Alex Jones show.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  So I think that we got to continue to do that. I mean, until they change, we cannot back down.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  We cannot give up. We cannot be cowardice in this situation.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  And I know that my stuff has been censored, which makes me mad.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000]  I mean, personally, I feel personal when they delete videos that I've worked so hard to produce, and I know there's going to be an impact.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  But we got to just keep sharing each other's content and keep putting it out there and try to do our best to be in the streets
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  and meet people where they are like physically going and doing speeches and stuff, which is what I want to do.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  And I think we'll continue to be successful.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  Separate from that. Here you are, you know, smart, articulate, handsome American.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  And just so it happens to be black.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  And you're out there doing this great work. You're popular with the real people.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  And then there's Spike Lee and everybody and Snoop Dogg injecting the most vicious hate, calling that.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  This is Spike Lee when he's winning this big award for his new movie, which I'm sure the movie is probably good.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  I'm sure the message is fine.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  My issue is with what he's doing now.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  That mother effort was given a chance to say, we're about love and not hate.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Well, that's what Trump's been doing.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  And that mother effort did not denounce that mother effing clan.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  He like a 50 times he did.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  They kept saying denounce announce and the alt right and that Nazi mother efforts.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  No, he said the alt right was bad at Charlottesville.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  He said Antifa also is just as bad and is a horrible, nasty, evil group as well.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  The media lied and Spike Lee's not stupid.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  Snoop Dogg's not stupid.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  I mean, he used to be friends with Trump.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  They all know Trump's a good guy.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  So now Hollywood wants this, the Democrats want this and they're out there promoting the real hate here, the real division in my view.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  What's your view on that?
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  Well, it's a tribe like mentality.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  Unfortunately, culturally, this is what happens.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Spike Lee has to come out and say that if Spike Lee was to be honest and identify with the successes of Donald Trump,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  he will literally be, you know, thrown out of the community.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  No one would want to watch his movies.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  They'll call him an uncle Tom in a cell out.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  So with that mentality, it's very difficult for people who don't have a strong spine to come out and tell the truth.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Snoop Dogg, they want to sell records.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  They want to be in the end crowd in the black community.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  And to be honest, the people who are in Charlottesville, they know what the truth is.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  The people who are living in these Democrat run cities who are unemployed and homeless.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  They know what it is.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  Those are the individuals that go to these rallies.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  Those are the individuals that go out and vote.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  So I'm disappointed in Spike Lee.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  I'm disappointed in Snoop Dogg and these other people who I would consider to be cowards.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  I'm disappointed in their approach because they're killing the minds of young people who would otherwise be more successful.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  But I'm telling you this, it is going to change.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  The tide is going to turn.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  They can only talk stupid and make up lies and be emotional for only so long before the facts are revealed and people start really changing.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  I mean, I happened to study Trump.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  And he's well known, 40 plus years ago, actually bringing in black promoters, everybody.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  And for the first time treating him good when the other hotel owners and people wouldn't.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  He's the first guy to buy up all these weird racist country clubs and then open them up.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  I mean, he was hated when he took over Mar-Lago and opened it up to Jews and blacks and everybody else.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  Trump's famous. That's why all the rappers loved him.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  And the way they all know him, a lot of them have stayed at his house.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  A lot of them have been on his boat with him.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  They know how much Trump likes everybody.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  And the fact that they treat him like that shows that they're beyond just race pimps.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  They are evil deceivers, in my view.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  It's backfiring on them.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  I'm telling you, these individual people can see they've been there.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  They went to the rallies and the mainstream tells you one thing.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  And they have their polls and everything.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000]  They suggest one thing, but the voters come out and do something different.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  And I'm telling you, as sure as I'm sitting here, is that it's going to be a change.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  There's a lot of people that do not agree with these mainstream folks.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  And when voting time comes, when 2020 comes around, we're going to see a landslide in voting.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  They just cannot verbalize it right now because they'll be shunned.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  But, you know, I think the cream rises to the top.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Donald Trump should have never been president with all the stuff that they did against him and all of the above.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  But see, he's the cream of the crop and he will rise to the top.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  And I'll say this one thing.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  I watched him at that ceremony where that young lady got killed, that police officer.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And he was holding hands with her 90-year-old grandmother.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  And with all of these people showing so much love, literally, I started tearing up because of how genuine that man is.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  And the world can see that.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  And we're going to start, and people are going to start exercising what they see and not what they hear.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000]  Wow, man, you're really making me get tears in my eyes because I can feel it spiritually.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  This evil spirit of us hating each other and being all afraid.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  And Trump is, and we together, we're breaking that spirit right now.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  Yes, we are. We are.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  One person at a time, one video at a time, one dedicated segment at a time.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  We're going to change it.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  And as long as we keep our faith in God and keep praying, we're going to make it happen.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  And it's going to happen not because we want our party to win, but it's because this is what's right.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  This is what's best for this country.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  That's right.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  And a bunch of the Republican blue bloods, they're getting pushed aside as well.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  The truth is coming out and no amount of lies from Hillary Clinton or Spike Lee or Michael Moore are going to work.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  We'll be back to talk about how we get on the offense.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  That's blackriflerealestate.com.

[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  We have a guy in the White House. I'm not going to say his f***ing name. It was a defining moment.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  It was not just Americans for the world. And that mother f***ing was giving a chance to say we are about love and not hate.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  And that mother f***ing did not denounce the mother f***ing clan, the alt-right and the Nazi mother f***ing.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  It was a defining moment and he could have said to the world, not the United States, that we were better than that.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  The so-called mother f***ing, creole democracy, that's some bull s***.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  The United States of America was built upon the genocide of Native people and slavery.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  That is the fabric of the United States of America.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  As my broken brother Jay, he would say, facts. I was given Susan Brose's phone number.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  That's enough. I shouldn't even waste time playing that.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  There's slavery going on in seven Muslim nations right now. No one's saying evil didn't go everywhere.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  No one's saying it's good. But just living it constantly, that's what Kanye West was saying, shouldn't be our identity.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  And then it shouldn't be George Soros in Hollywood promoting it.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  It's in the WikiLeaks to keep us at each other's throats.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:06.000]  But people like Brandon Tatum, the Turning Point USA, he's the director of urban engagement.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]  So earlier, for people that just joined us, we are breaking the trance.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  Give us your report, sir, of traveling around the country, going to these big black colleges.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  What you're seeing there?
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  Yeah, we're in the works of getting into these colleges. I spoke at Texas State.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000]  And right now, it's a struggle, you know, because when I spoke at Texas State, we invited Black Lives Matter.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  We invited all these other groups that are Afrocentric, and they were too afraid to show up.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  And so we're going to try to do our best to get into these HBCUs, which is our plan moving forward.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  I know for a fact we're going to have adversity because people like Spike Lee, and I'm not saying this is all black people,
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  people like Spike Lee are too cowardice to have a real conversation.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  I used to have respect for Spike Lee, and if I saw him face to face today, I'm telling me a coward in his face.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  Because what he's saying is despicable. It is embarrassing.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  Because the whole world is looking at African-American people, and they're seeing an idiot like him say what he said.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  Listen, when you're talking about something that happened a hundred years ago, you're so distraught as a millionaire in America,
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  and you don't leave, and then you turn around, and there's people gunning young black people down in our own communities.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  There's drug dealers selling our young people drugs. I've got family members who are on drugs right now.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  I know how it has ruined our family. People are in prison.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:32.000]  You know, and this guy is talking about Donald Trump. People in the hood, people in these communities that he's trying to represent,
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  they're not worrying about Donald Trump. They're not worrying about what the news is saying.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  They're worrying about picking up dead young people off the street every day.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  I was about to say as a former police officer, a slot officer, I mean what, 2,000 black people die a year in Chicago,
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  thousands more injured, never a word from the liberals.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  I mean, why is it everywhere liberals run it, rich white liberals mainly, that there's such death and destruction,
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  and then Spike Lee and people like, you know, all those folks, Michael Moore, they've all got bodyguards,
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  but then poor people, they say, can't have bodyguards.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  Well, you know, it's hypocrisy because they not only pay money for bodyguards, if they get in trouble and they go to court,
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  they have a whole team of attorneys that can support them. They're not getting an appointed person.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  You know, they have a whole bunch of things that give them advantages in this country that they refuse to give back.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:28.000]  I'll tell you this for a matter of fact, African-American people in this country need to start worrying about and focusing on the government.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:36.000]  We have enough economic wealth. If they put all the black people together in America, we'll be like the top 15 richest country in the world.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  We have enough economic wealth as individuals that if we came back and put that money into our communities,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:48.000]  if we built our own schools, if we put books into our own schools, if we had programs that would help young black people in our own communities,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000]  all of these black churches in these communities, we could have our own economy.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  But see, people like Spike Lee, they want to make all this money off the backs of black people and then turn around and point the finger at the government.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  It just makes me so mad and I wish these things would change.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  Myself, Candace Owens, Turning Point USA, we are going to do our best to be a part of the change.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Obviously, you too, Alex, I know that you are heavily involved and you want to be more involved in this stuff and I know that you will be active.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  But we're all together. We have to do our best at changing this narrative.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  These people are suckers. Spike Lee is a sucker.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  And any one of these people that get out and talk like him, I'll tell them to their face.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  Well, he knows Michael Moore, all these guys behind the scenes, some people that know him, these liberal elites know it's a game plan.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they're going out to stir up cultural division. That's what they call it.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  Donald Trump said a million times that he disavowed these people. He said it a million times.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  He said it the day of, he said it when they talked to confront him and said he didn't say it fast enough.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  I don't know what other way can he say that he disavowed these people and that all evil in America, this is what they want, Alex.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  This is what they want him to say. They want him to say white people are bad.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  They don't want him to say evil is wrong, no matter where it's coming from. They want him to focus on white people.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000]  And then those are the things that they try to, you know, say behind the scenes and not be...
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  By the way, didn't they found two videos of him on TV 20 plus years ago, denouncing Duke without anyone even asking him to?
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:26.000]  The man is not a racist. I don't understand how they think he's a racist and, you know, anti-Semitic.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  I don't understand how a person with a connection or connected brainstem can come to that conclusion with all of the things that he done.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000]  I'll tell you this, you cannot be that successful and that wide of a range.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  You cannot get more of the black vote than any other Republican candidate that have run for the presidency in the last few years.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  If you are a blatant racist, this man is trying to fix DACA, something that Obama would never try to do.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  This man is focusing on the black community, something that Obama would never do.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  This man is open to all people. He want America to become great. He's not saying I want white people to be great again.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  He said America, lower in taxes.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  And that's my last question for you and I hope you can come back for a full hour soon and take calls.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  How do people get involved to help what you're doing? You're actually going out in the community.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  You're actually going into these universities that have been totally brainwashed.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  These factories of division and you're actually bringing the real message of Martin Luther King back into these communities.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  Yes, I think if people want to directly contact me, I have an email.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  It's brandon.tatum at tpusa.com.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  Go to my email, email me. Let me know if you want to get involved. Let me know what city you're in.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  If you have something going on in the city, you need me or candidates or somebody to come and that's to facilitate growth there
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  or for us to do certain things. I mean, we're open to it.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  I mean, that's our whole mission is to go out and reach America.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  And I think that the African Americans in this country really need a lot of help and I think myself and candidates can be good advocates.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000]  But that's for the bigger picture. We want to help African Americans because when African Americans do well, the rest of the country does well.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  And I don't want to think people think it's just, it's all about black people. It's not.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  No, but the Democrats think that they own black people and then Republicans just get stared and just stand back and let the Democrats do whatever they want.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  And it's time to say no.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  Right. Exactly. 100%. We just a new day, a new age. We're not going to dwell on the past. We're going to focus on our future.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  And we're going to do everything that we can as long as we're breathing on this earth to make things better.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  Amazing. Brandon Tatum. Again, we appreciate the great work you're doing.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  We look forward to having you back and look forward to having our crew go cover this amazing conference you've got coming up as well.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  God bless you, my friend. We're watching your great work. You really do inspire us all.

[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and so much more.

[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:41.000]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:43.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:50.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:21.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  We're going to go to Moms for Trump, Cherie Saber here in just a few minutes on this other issue of censorship.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.000]  I've warned Paul Watson, I've warned my crew, I've warned you the listeners, not that I'm that smart.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  I've just learned globalist tactics and how they operate. I've warned everybody that they're going to censor, censor, censor in little ways, in medium-sized ways, sometimes in big ways,
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  and then back off and do it over and over and over again until the hammer drops.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  And the hammer's dropping basically right now. In the next few months, or six months out from the midterms, you're going to see massive censorship.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  And if the president gets set for this, the globalists could win.
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  So that's the reality here, ladies and gentlemen. And it's very, very serious.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  This needs to be big national news. What I've got here, and I, we had this yesterday. No one even cares to do an article in Infowars.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  I know some of the crew is back there, but it's a list of major conservative commentators, Trump supporters, nationalists, who are basically to be banned from being able to communicate with on Facebook May 24th.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  That's nine days away. All the screenshots, the emails, have them all.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  It's a shadow banning. And not even letting Republican Party advertise with Facebook.
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  I don't get any of this money. When Diamond and Silk were before Congress two weeks ago, and Congressman Hank Johnson kept going, you're making a lot of money off Facebook.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  You're making a lot of money. They're like, no, we don't make any money off Facebook. We just reach people with our message.
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  And they're censored everywhere because they're well-spoken. They're funny.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  And Tatum is charismatic and smart. They're banning him off the Internet. Turning Point USA. It's here.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  And the Wall Street Journal said, what, three months ago, they said, well, we think Jones can be, you know, demonized easily.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  We'll take him out of context. What he said. And once we ban Jones and WikiLeaks, we can ban everybody.
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:14.000]  And what did he say? What did the new CEO say? Of News Corp. It's emerging with Disney.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:22.000]  He said, once we do that, we're going to block everybody from communicating on these big platforms, except for big companies.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  And he said, we'll make hundreds of billions more. He wasn't even saying politically, let's stop the conservatives.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  He's like, no, let's do this. We're going to make a lot of money. They're ending the Internet as we know it.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  So Cherise Sabre is a creative and vehement supporter of Donald Trump and the Trump movement.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:52.000]  We can roll some footage of her, too, when she got him, had her questions at any of the shots from our press conference a month and a half ago about censorship in D.C.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:37:00.000]  In 2016, she volunteered for the Trump campaign and co-founded Moms4Trump.org and designed the logo to make sure it stands.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:08.000]  Moms4Trump, and now she's reached tens of millions of people, was initiated and designed to bring out the votes as well as getting all people on the Trump train.
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  Cherie now is in the D.C. area, continues to support Trump by taking the grassroots streets, talking to people.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  And it just goes on from there. We're really excited to have her on because she made some great points at the press conference when we were there.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:30.000]  So Cherie, great to have you on and great to talk to somebody who was instrumental in helping get Trump elected.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  Hi, Alex. What a pleasure it is to see you again in this arena. It was really nice running into you in D.C. It was a tremendous momentum given.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  And I want to thank you for bringing me on here to make a few points.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  She strongly supported Donald Trump during the campaign. It was sheer by accident. I was listening to a radio station and what I heard was just unacceptable.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  And when I researched it, I realized it was a big lie and that's what got me the momentum.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  Now, as it were, I co-founded Moms for Trump during the campaign.
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  When we co-founded that, it wasn't obvious that they actually wanted to really make it a movement.
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  And I certainly did take it into Virginia and started working on it and it started to pick up some speed and some momentum.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  But that's a story for another time. I think there were some nefarious carrying on. There are people who really did not want Trump to win.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  But as I said, once I was invited on the Armstrong-Williams show, then I believe and I still do that Donald Trump was divinely ordained at this time now for what's happening.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  I have taken to D.C. the grassroots. I have been doing it, literally I've been doing it by doing a ride share.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  And I'm talking to people and I want to address what Whoopi Goldberg said, that there are only two people support one black person supporting Trump.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:24.000]  Well, let me just say this. You are going to be so surprised that in 2020, Donald Trump is going to win by an unrefutable landslide.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  And let me just add that from what I have seen, experienced in my guts, Donald Trump is going to win with a massive black vote.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  So I just wanted to put that out here. So Whoopi, if you're listening and you will hear, you will be proven wrong like so many black people, which I believe will ultimately bow down to Donald Trump.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  I am a guest at the congressman, Johnson, when he addressed dominant silk to women that myself I have been in contact in post counters with during the campaign.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  I was a guest and just completely distressed at how he literally said it stood down.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  So these people have themselves in this high, high and mighty position, looking down on other black people. And I think that is an absolute appalling thing.
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  I'm in DC and the mayor of DC is black. DC has some horrible, horrible poverty that's going on there.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:50.000]  I drive into these places and one thing I can say to you, the people are being purposely dumbed down. They are being purposely misled.
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:41:00.000]  They talk about Donald Trump in like really stupid things I hear. Well, you know, he's bankrupt. He's not a good businessman.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  All of these are all of the narrative that they're telling these people.
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  But now look at how so much of what he is doing is working in the way the economy is turning around, but the system is trying to defeat him.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  What's going to happen? Shari Saber, founder of Moms for Trump, one of the biggest grassroots organizations out there during the campaign, very successful, and narrowed out their fight on the street.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  What's going to happen if they do derail Trump successfully and then everything falls apart? Because this country was disintegrating before he got in there.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  I mean, do you think America really will? Because I agree with you. Take Providence and throw it in the trash can.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  Well, let me just say this, Alex. Donald Trump is not going to be derailed. I have said it before. We all know it and we all feel it.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  Donald Trump was divinely ordained for this time. You know, what I saw on the campaign, when I volunteered, I did the telephones and all of these things.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  And I can't express to you how spiritual this experience was. I mean, people prayed. People were coming together in ways that I never would have even imagined.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  I was never a political person prior to this. I had no idea. I didn't care.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  By the way, Trump has said publicly and privately that he became a much stronger Christian during this thing. He changed. He felt the spirit.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  100%. I mean, it was a spirit as the spirit remains. Donald Trump is, you know, the man is a leader of peace.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  I once said on the Armstrong Williams show, I felt Donald Trump is loved. And, you know, whatever they left, they try to paint him as this hideous human being.
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  We all know that it's a lie. I just want to also say a lot of...
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  Hold on. You're going to have the floor. Shari Saber. Awesome lady. Awesome name, too.
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  Go beyond censorship. Brainwash young people against info wars. Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalist. It is so critical that you go to infowars.com,

This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae and I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  Non GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing.

[01:46:50.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  Something the globalists are targeting. Visit infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:26.000]  You've made a ton of money off of Facebook, isn't that correct? You all have been bashing Facebook and you've been making a ton of money, isn't that correct?
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  Have you been making money? They've been messing with your money there. We're giving you a tremendous platform with this hearing to make a ton of money when it's over.
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  But rather than diamonds, you're seeking money with Facebook, isn't that correct? I'm just astounded that this committee would stoop to this level to be positioning you all to make more money.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:09.000]  You know, everybody knows what the N word is. I had never heard of the M word, Representative Shankowski, the M word.
[01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  But to my discovery, just within the last 12 hours or so, I have found that the use of the midget, excuse me, the use of the M word is no longer socially acceptable.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  The M word refers to a group of people, the little people.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  This is an island that at its widest level is 12 miles from shore to shore. My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  We don't anticipate that.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  The reason I play that is, we played like 10 minutes of it back when it was live when Diamond and Silk were there about the censorship of conservatives by the big tech titans, which is just unbelievably bad.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:30.000]  It's like Chinese Communist level. And he just chews into them and how dare you and look at you and you just want to make money.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  I remember another congressman, I forget his name, he's the ranking Democrat from Tennessee. There was some other black Trump supporters last year in a committee hearing with him.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  And he was like, you watch your mouth talking to me like that. And something about Democrats, I'm not just saying this to like try to make black people mad, but I've seen it myself.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  Black Democrats particularly, but some white Southern Democrats will talk to black people like their dogs.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  You can watch the whole Hank Johnson thing. I don't have time to get to it today. You can go online and watch it.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  I mean, you're like the arrogance. And you see Cherie Saber, we didn't talk before she came on. I didn't know she was going to bring that up.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  She picked up the same thing where she was acting like a plantation owner and I just, the Democratic Party just takes it for granted that women or minorities or everybody else are going to support them when they're such bad people.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  That's why I'm seeing Cherie and so many other people out there breaking this trance and I wanted to ask her, she was going to make her point about thinking Trump's divinely inspired.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  I believe that as well. And I think God's going to give us Providence, but I think still if we don't do enough, they might be able to take Trump out.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:46.000]  We're not saying he's an angel. The point is God during the Bible used to choose, you know, bad guys, good guys, kings, Saul of, you know, Tarsus on the road to Damascus.
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  I mean, Trump could have been an evil guy. Trump would have been chosen and changed his heart. But you know a tree by its fruits.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000]  They're trying to get rid of him. But just finishing up with Hank Johnson and where you think this whole fight's going.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  And what happens once Trump is able to really deliver and the left panics, what are they going to do when everything they've said has been proven to be alive?
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  Because you also mentioned hearing a big lie about Trump, looking it up, finding out it was a lie and that that lie made you so mad it made you support Trump.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:21.000]  I mean, that's the same thing too. So I just threw out a lot there. You can take that, Hank Johnson, Trump Divinely Inspired, where you want to go because you're the founder of momsfortrump.org.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  We'll hold you a little bit the next hour as well. Go ahead.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  Well, first of all, I want to say to the Black Congressional establishment.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  You know, one of the hardest things for people to do is to admit that they're wrong.
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  I would recommend to them that they now admit that they're wrong at this time.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  Because they will be proving over and over as they have been wrong and wrong again.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  Trump is not going to be overturned by them. There is entirely too much arrogance that is going on.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  Maxine Walters impeached Trump, frankly, as we all can agree, Maxine Walters should be herself impeached.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  And or she could take all of the energy and going into those Black communities right there in D.C. where she works.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  I can't tell you how many of those people, those impoverished Black people, dumbed down Black people are saying to me,
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  they just wish that some of these so-called successful Blacks would come into their communities and say to them,
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:43.000]  here is how you do it. So this is the kind of thing, Alex. Are you there?
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  Absolutely. I'm listening. I'm riveted.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Okay. So that's one of the things. One of the things that I consistently hear from the dumbed down community,
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  they would say that Donald Trump is a racist and they often reference the Central Park Five.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  But let me just make a point about the Central Park Five.
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  When Donald Trump acted with taking out a newspaper article on the Central Park Five,
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  remember how Black men were portrayed in the media at this time?
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  It was the media, Alex, that would portray Black men consistently as criminals.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  It doesn't matter if they walk through the store, they accuse them of stealing,
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  and then the television camera would portray them always as criminal, always as looking so horrible.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  They would dart in their faces, they would handcuff them no matter what the case may be.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  Whatever the action that Donald Trump did was actually perpetuate, the media created that.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  So don't blame Donald Trump. He's not a racist.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  The Central Park Five was in a situation that happened because of the media.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  And here we go again. It's the media that's creating all of this havoc in all of our communities.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  Black, white, political, whatever you want to call it.
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  So I just wanted to address that issue.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000]  Well, I agree with you. So what do you think, Shari Saber, the establishment's going to do when everything they throw at Trump fails?
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  It's now coming out today that Mueller was working with secret Russian oligarchs, not Trump.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000]  That's in the Hill newspaper. I mean, we knew this years ago, but it's all coming out.
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  What are they going to do as it comes out that it's all politically motivated,
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  that Obama ordered illegal spying, that they got caught lying about it?
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000]  I mean, this is devastating.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  Yeah, it is going to come out.
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:49.000]  And these people are going, I'm telling you, they will bow down to Donald Trump.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  It's going to be difficult, Alice, as I said, it's hard for people to admit that they're wrong.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  It's going to be very difficult for them.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  But I can say to you this, Donald Trump is not going to be overthrown.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  You know, black people say, when Donald Trump said, make America great again,
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  and they will say to me, when was America ever great for blast?
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  I don't know if you can recognize the fact that I'm not an American born.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  My mother came here as a domestic and she went through the process and she made,
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  our children came and we were legal and she went to work and she bought her home.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  America was great when you can go and you can do your eight hour day job and you save your money
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  and bring your money home and save up and buy your house and send your children to school.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  America was great when our roads.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  Exactly.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  It's not that we're perfect, but there's this demonization of the idea of the free market
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  and culture being successful and the globalists are doing it.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  We know, again, from the internal documents, two sabotage things.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  I mean, they're the bad guys, the globalists, Hollywood.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  These are nasty people.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  And speaking of Hollywood, America was great when Hollywood was respected.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  When you can walk down the street and you saw a celebrity and you were happy to meet that celebrity.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.000]  It's not that way anymore.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  There is no respect for Hollywood among real people.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  And that's another entity that you will see falling down.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  So we stay there.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  I want to come back and get into a couple other topics with you in a short segment.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  And then we've got Dan Lyman joining us, but stay right there.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  I've got a plug, though, speaking of being under attack.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000]  Info Wars is under attack.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  The globalists are out to get us.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  They're kicking us off every platform.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  We've just got documents in that Facebook is preparing to basically ban us for all intents and purposes on the 24th, where no one can even communicate with us or basically come to the pages.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  This is all ahead of the midterms.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  I'm not complaining.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  We've been very successful is why they're after us, but Info Wars is needed into the future and future attacks we have to deal with.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  So it's easy to fund the operation.
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:06.000]  We have great products, thousands of them, highest quality, big sales, great supplements, back in stock, survival shield X2.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  It is 25% off.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  We've only got like a run and a half left of this.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  And I'm trying to get more supplies of the deep breath crystals.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000]  This is the good allergen.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  The toothpaste fluoride free 50% off.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  That's about to end.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000]  And a bunch of other specials that have got to end very, very soon.
[01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  Take advantage of those specials at InfoWarsLive.com and fund the first amendment in the fight to defeat the globalist.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000]  Remember, imagine how bad it'd be if InfoWars wasn't here, if you weren't here, and we hadn't stopped the globalist.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping.

[02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  Jerry Saber is our guest for another two segments, then I'm going to hit a bunch of news we haven't gotten to yet and then Dan Lyman is going to join us.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  I was making jokes yesterday about how hilarious it is that BuzzFeed says, look, Alex Jones is run by foreign powers.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  He needs to be shut down and Facebook is on to him.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  And right after I got that news, we started getting calls from Republicans and people everywhere going, we're banned from our organization advertising with Facebook to reach your listeners.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  And they say that you're basically going to be shut down the 24th and then we got the documents.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000]  We haven't written an article yet about it.
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000]  I don't even know how to respond to this.
[02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  And I'm sitting there joking.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:25.000]  Look at this, they say because we have Dan Lyman in Switzerland and they've got a computer watching us, everything we do.
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  And they saw that someone uploaded from Switzerland, so that means we're far and run.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  But it's not funny, even though I'm laughing at it, because the general public's dumbed down, they'll go, oh, look, they won't even think, well, wait, other people have bureaus in other countries.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.000]  But see, there's that idea that CNN or BBC, they can have bureaus overseas.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  They can have reporters upload stuff, but I can't.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000]  I'm bad.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  I'm a Christian.
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000]  I'm a conservative.
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  I'm a nationalist.
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  I'm dirty.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:05.000]  And then it lists all these websites that, oh, look, there's a manager in Switzerland.
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  That's not even true.
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000]  We've got more than 10 Facebook pages, more than 3 million likes.
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000]  That one's got, this is more than 3 million.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  That one's got 900,000.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  That's just the infowars.com page.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  And that's all managed from right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  We have one reporter in Europe, Dan Lyman.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  But look how this is like Nazi Germany or something, where I got to sit here and explain this like it's bad.
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  But again, it's how Buzzfeed makes it look.
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:39.000]  Oh, oh, we're talking to Facebook and they've got a tool and we caught Alex Jones.
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.000]  He's got this going on.
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  A new Facebook feature shows which pro-Trump pages are run from overseas.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  And the same day we get to where they're going to bash for all intents and purposes.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  It's just a sherry saber.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  This is a short statement.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  We're going to one minute break.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  We'll come back for 10 more minutes.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:05.000]  But we were just talking about the nature of this.
[02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  It's funny how they lie, except it's not funny because they know they're lying and they get away with it and it's getting more intense.
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  How authoritarian do you think the left or whatever these people are going to get?
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  Because they're getting violent.
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.000]  They're getting aggressive.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  They're lying about everything.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  I mean, how far is this going to go in your view?
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000]  Sherry, how far is this going to go?
[02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  Yes, I'm here.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  Oh, you're on.
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  Sorry about that.
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.000]  I know how Skype is.
[02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  It's okay.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  I'm saying how far do you think this evil is going to go?
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  Well, I think this evil will go as far as it will.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  It will play out to the point where the people who are on the side of evil will learn.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  They're all on a trajectory.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  They're on a path of knowledge.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  They're on a path of their own experience.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:59.000]  One thing I can say, you know, it's interesting and I'm going to bring a little spiritual context in here.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  Whenever you go to a Trump gathering, a Trump rally or any one of those things,
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:11.000]  you truly feel a presence of kind and love in all of those things.
[02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  The same is not true when you're gathering in any gathering of the other side,
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  even if you're just watching it on television.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  So the point of this is, you know, America is going through a transition.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.000]  Okay?
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  What's happening? America and the world.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  And Donald Trump is leading that.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000]  I agree.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000]  This is a major seismic sea change.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:39.000]  Let's talk about that and quantify that with Cherise Sabre on the other side.
[02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  This is the Info War.
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  The globalists are trying to block us on every front.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000]  But you, by sharing the link, sharing the videos,
[02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  and sharing the local stations you're listening to or watching us on,
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  are breaking their Berlin Wall.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  You are crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by Info War's life.
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:11.000]  with our specially formulated prebiotic fiber,
[02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria,
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  Info War's life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality,
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000]  organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:49.000]  throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  Harry Saber, Moms4Trump.org. I've seen her on television a few times and seen some of her work,
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  and then bam, she's right there at our press conference about censorship.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.000]  And now Facebook is saying we're far and run and need to be banned
[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  because we have a uploader, Dan Lyman, in Switzerland.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:59.000]  You cannot make this up. We've got the letters here where they intend to basically ban us on the 24th.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  For all intents and purposes, Shadow Man, our page is on Facebook where no one can contact us.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000]  We can't contact you. You won't be able to see our videos on there anymore.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  That's why you've got to make the Exodus to infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  We're going to an article out on this soon. Might even already be up.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  Let's check infowars.com. Put that up periodically, please, for TV viewers.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  But remember, that's where you find us is infowars.com.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  Newswars.com. We just migrated its servers to a better system yesterday.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000]  There's a few broken links on there right now, but we're updating that website.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  And we also have prismplanet.com.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  Also, if you sign up for our free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter,
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  then you get exclusive articles, videos, and information that if they shut everything down we're doing,
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000]  we'll still be able to reach you via that.
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000]  So, critical information.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000]  Now, going back to Cherie Saber, you were getting biblical here,
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  and you're talking about the evil of the globalists and their minions
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000]  and how to Trump rally. You feel a good spirit.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  People are happy. They're nice. You go to a Democrat event.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000]  There's disease. There's ugliness. There's unhappy people.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:09.000]  There's all this weird occultism. Pedophilia continually being connected to it.
[02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000]  I mean, truly, Democratic parties had problems for a long time,
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000]  but they are just descending into disintegration, it seems.
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000]  And I don't think they know yet they're in their death rows. What do you think?
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:27.000]  Look, there is a lot of evil. The word that comes to mind right now is demonic.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  I just heard the clip you played of Spike Lee,
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  which, what a disappointment.
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  You know, there's an essence of demonicism going on.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.000]  It is, you can almost...
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  Well, no, he's like crouching down and almost on fire. He's so hateful.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  And then what he's saying is a lie.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:55.000]  There's a lot of hate. And we know and we understand, you know,
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  where there is love, hate's trying to thrive.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  And there's the hatefulness that they're launching at the president over and over again.
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  You realize that it's not working.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000]  And so, you know, of course, there should be pause for concern, indeed,
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  because the devil lurks, but I truly believe that love will truly conquer all.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.000]  I think Donald and everybody, they know that.
[02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000]  And, you know, I remember during the campaign, I remember the ex-president,
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000]  when Donald Trump said, you know, I am going to bring jobs.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  I'm going to bring our businesses back.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  I am going to fix the infrastructure and make America great again.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  And what the president then said, Mr. Barack Obama,
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.000]  he said that, what is he going to do? Wave a magic wand?
[02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000]  And that was a very interesting comment to me.
[02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000]  Let me just say that God is love. God is magic.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  Of course, if there is such a thing, then so shall it be.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  We see it happening.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:04.000]  Donald Trump is, he's doing amazing things with divine grace.
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000]  And I truly believe...
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  And you were talking about a great time is coming of change.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000]  I think we're basically here, but it's going to get more intense.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  And everywhere, not just around the world, there is this big awakening happening.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  And evil's becoming more evil. Good's becoming better.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  It's becoming stronger.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  This is a very interesting time right now.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  And we're bursting into a new paradigm.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:29.000]  Alex, you know, when you talk about everybody being banned,
[02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  I know I put a few things out on YouTube, very few, and it doesn't show up.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000]  But you know what? I'm one of the people I don't care because I know one thing.
[02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  The censorship that is going on, the blocking of our first and second amendment,
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  what this is going to do, it is going to just create a new way of doing things, right?
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  And guess who's going to be on the forefront of that?
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.000]  When you see this kind of a thing happening, you know the next step is to create something new,
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  something that they cannot touch.
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  And believe me, I feel that this will happen.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:17.000]  So, you know, it's as if the adage says, if you're going to dig a somebody's grave,
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  be sure that you did one for yourself.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  And this is the spiritual context, you know, that I'm seeing here.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000]  You're right.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  The fight is going to get worse.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  The evil is going to show every single hand that they have.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.000]  But we can fight it and we are fighting it by doing exactly what everyone is doing.
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000]  The guess that you're having on your show, Alex, I have to say,
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  recently I'm observing you are in a consistent momentum of fight
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  and getting it out there.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000]  And I don't think that is falling on deaf ears.
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000]  I think that you might be surprised to know that there are so many more people
[02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000]  than you can imagine who's tuned in.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  And I think that it will reap an amazing benefit.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:11.000]  I mean, look, you have Facebook and you have Twitter and you have this one entity.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  Wouldn't it be interesting that from all of this censorship,
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  when you have a plan, you prune it and it grows a new plan, right?
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000]  Well, it's just like, yeah, exactly trim the rose bush that comes back to us better.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  I agree with what you're saying.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.000]  If the public knows how serious it is, if the public gets upset and spreads the word,
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000]  then the rose bush will be even bigger and healthier.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:42.000]  But if they don't get upset about this, they could really be successful with this takeover
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  because this is the most draconian censorship we've ever seen in Europe.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:54.000]  As you know, there are resting people that even report on Islamic crime waves.
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  They are just really cracking down.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:01.000]  Communist China is working heavily with Silicon Valley to censor.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000]  And this is really criminal.
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000]  And I'd like to see the president, he's starting to do it.
[02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:10.000]  I'd like to see him move against them because these are foreign international powers doing this.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000]  And it's very draconian.
[02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000]  And I think he will in due time, Alex, everything in its season.
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  All of the horrible things, the lies, the deception, the unfair legal practices that has been going on.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.000]  All of this will come to rest.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:40.000]  And I also want to make the point, Donald Trump won because a huge amount of people voted for him.
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000]  We call them the silent majority.
[02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:52.000]  And I can say to you, during this time, I observed there's a lot of people coming together who never, ever, ever had anything to do with politics before.
[02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000]  But it goes beyond politics.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  It is about uniting a mindset.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  It's about uniting a country.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  In this case, the United States of America.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:10.000]  And I believe that as we move forward, you are going to see things as we're saying.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:16.000]  Rita Ray, you're going to see things happening that will, well, we are already things that's blowing your mind.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:21.000]  And by the way, I agree with what you're saying at an instinctive level, a spiritual level.
[02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000]  The things that were coming were so bad.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000]  I think this big awakening is our spirit, our instinct pushing back.
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:40.000]  I'm just hoping that it's enough and not too little too late because the level of evil and this technocracy and this global system and the human cloning and everything is so anti-human.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.000]  It's so anti-life.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  It's so satanic.
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000]  And the dumbing down of people.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:54.000]  Now, and I just want to also make a point here that I've also observed that people have been so silent.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.000]  The silent majority, they have been so afraid to say, no, you're wrong.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.000]  They have been so afraid to step up to the plate and said, you know, stop it.
[02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  I recently had a situation and, you know, after a while, when you're being bashed and you're being kicked and you're down on the ground and you're still fighting, you will get the strength and you will get up.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  You know, I tell you this, people come into my car, I told you that I purposely do a ride share and I talk to people to get a feel.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000]  And I can say to you, people are saying, they blame Trump for everything.
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000]  And one by one, one by one, you ask an interesting question.
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:40.000]  One of the questions I asked is why if Donald Trump was so bad, why would he want to give jobs to people?
[02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000]  Why would he want to do all these things?
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000]  Let's talk about his real crime a few more minutes with you because this is the crossroad.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000]  Trump wants a pro-human future.
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  The technocrats want an anti-human, post-human future.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:16:13.000]  What they're doing and only Elon Musk is exposing it.
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:33.000]  You'll discover the 18 best cash cows that can help you earn up to an extra $6,800 a month.

[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000]  but the symptoms are there.
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:30.000]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000]  You know, I don't ever really hype stuff.
[02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  And I should because people will only pay attention if you hype things.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000]  But we do cover a lot of sensational things.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000]  We do tell you what's happening years before it's mainstream news.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000]  I mean, we told you all about Mueller and how it was an intelligence operation by the deep state.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:53.000]  And we would use the term deep state 20 years ago, permanent state shadow government, COG.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  And now, oh my gosh, Rush Limbaugh came out yesterday and said,
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  Mueller is a fraud and the whole thing was a set up and it's all political and it's all over the news.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000]  Dun dun dun dun.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  Rush Limbaugh says, and that's great.
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.000]  That's great.
[02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:14.000]  But the point is you're getting the real dope here, not the fake stuff.
[02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  We've got their number and, you know, I know who the leakers are inside the White House and why they can't stop it.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  And I should have started the broadcast today saying, you know, coming up an hour, number two or three,
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.000]  I will tell you that nobody waits to hear it.
[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  So you know what I'll do?
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:41.000]  Who's hosting the fourth hour?
[02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  Paul, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:53.000]  At the start of the second segment with Paul, I will announce who the real leakers are and why they can't stop it.
[02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000]  Pretty big deal.
[02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  And then I've got a bunch of other information.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:05.000]  Satellite imagery shows North Korea dismantling new test site, war good signs, taxpayer cash laundered through Somalia,
[02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:11.000]  daycares to fund terrorism, that's at infowars.com article, Jamie White.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:14.000]  We just got a lot of amazing stuff here to go over.
[02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  The Vatican trying to cover up all the pedophilia.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  There's a big story on that.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  But finishing up with Cherie Saber of momsfortrump.org.
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:31.000]  What a great lady and she does rideshare as a way of community outreach in D.C. to then talk to people in between running Moms For Trump
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  and everything else she does, MomsForTrump.org.
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000]  She had other points you wanted to make as we slammed into the break.
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:41.000]  So someone to hold you over so you finish that point Cherie.
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Yeah, so the point is all too long.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000]  We have conservatives.
[02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000]  We're now speaking up.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  You know, you go out and you hear people say horrible things.
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  And I want to say to people, feel empowered.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  The time is right.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000]  The time is now to speak up.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.000]  When you hear them saying horrible things about the president or horrible things about people.
[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  Recently this whole paradigm of black people in America saying white is bad.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000]  White is racist.
[02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  Speak up.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  Say no.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  It's time for you to not hide.
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  Stop hiding.
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  Now you must say, yes, I support the president.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.000]  Yes, I support black people standing on their own two feet.
[02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  Yes, I support making this country great again.
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.000]  The time is right.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  And that's the point I want to make.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000]  You can now.
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  Because now, you know, they're losing their tails.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  They know that they're wrong.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:48.000]  All of the CNN paid people there, especially the black people who are paid literally to make basically a fool of themselves.
[02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:52.000]  And to dumb down the rest of the black people and people in general.
[02:23:52.000 --> 02:24:02.000]  The time is right to stand up and show yourself as being a fighter for what is I believe is a movement and it's a movement towards the better good of this country.
[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  If America fall, Alex, the world will fall.
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000]  We know that.
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  If they do anything to Donald Trump, you have said it before.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  Everybody knows that it will be a very, very, very bad thing.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  So it's not going to happen.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  I think we're just at a point now where all of these people realizing they are so, so wrong.
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  I want to say dead wrong.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  Okay.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000]  But they're wrong.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  And they will, they will come to realize that and they will just have to apologize or bow down.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000]  That's the point I want to make.
[02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  When you use the term bow down, you mean like bow their head admitting that they were wrong?
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  100% Alex.
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000]  That's how it is.
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  They're wrong about accusing him of nefarious carrying arms.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  You know, it's amazing the narratives.
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  I heard one young woman said the one that talks like this.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  I talked to all of these kinds of people.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  And you know, what she hears is that Trump sleeps until 11 o'clock in the morning and then he goes and he plays golf.
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.000]  You cannot believe some of the lies that people are being told.
[02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  You cannot believe.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  Oh, I see that all the time in so-called liberal media.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.000]  They go, the president has private executive time until 11 a.m.
[02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000]  He's eating briefings that whole time.
[02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  And then the guy works till midnight almost every night.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  He's getting all this stuff done.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  He's constantly on the go.
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  And I mean, he did up to eight campaign stops a day, four states a day.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:40.000]  I mean, I know for a fact he was working until 2, 3 in the morning and then his young staff couldn't even keep up with him.
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  Or how about this one?
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  He didn't want to be president.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  He would never run for reelection.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  It was all a hoax.
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  He never get the economy to 3% growth rate.
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000]  He never pull out of the TPP.
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  It's all lies.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000]  Right.
[02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  Or, you know, the fact that he does not take a salary.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  When I tell people this, they cannot believe it.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  They've not heard this.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:09.000]  All of the great things about this president, somehow these people, I'm calling them the dumb, dumb down people have not heard.
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.000]  And yet we have people who are strong supporters that are silent.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  Well, I'm saying stop being silent.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  The time is ripe.
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:17.000]  You don't have to be silent anymore.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000]  You don't have to be afraid now to say that you support Donald Trump.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  And hello, if you say you support Donald Trump and they come up again, you have innumerable ammunition to fight back right then, right there.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  That's how we're going to do this.
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.000]  That's what is going to make this thing turn around.
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  And remember, you know, he was with us in Casa First home.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  Jesus said that.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  I know I know I'm speaking like I'm superb.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  I'm not like a super duper religious person, but you cannot help but realize.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.000]  No, it's true.
[02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  It's all archetypal and people that haven't been super religious, but are Christian, are feeling it.
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000]  And the president, the time I'm talking to Trump, he starts bringing up, you know, the energy and the churches and the people.
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  We're going to get religious freedom in America again.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  And I'm like, sure, this isn't like a talking point, is it?
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000]  I didn't say that.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  But no, that's really what he wants to talk about.
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.000]  And then other people I know that know him a lot better, they say he's into that.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000]  And it's really true.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:19.000]  And like I talked to some of the Secret Service people that were with me when he came out of that black church in Detroit,
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  as they laid hands on him and said he was annoying and all that.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  And Trump, they said, was just like, had chills and was just, man, I've never felt energy like that.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  That's even better, you know, than a rock concert.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:31.000]  He feels energy there too.
[02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  He's like, man, yes.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  And so he just feels the good energy of good people.
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  All that whatever it is, the guy wants to do good.
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  He's not perfect.
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  He's not out to get us.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  He doesn't have satanic energy.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  And that's what scares him.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000]  He does not have satanic energy.
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  And that's the thing.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  And, you know, that's, it's a creepy thing to even fathom.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:58.000]  But there definitely is, one could say, a satanic element in, I mean, when you look at Hollywood, it's amazing to me.
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000]  It's as if these people are possessed.
[02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  I mean, when Maxine Walters go up there and talk about in peach four to five, when in fact she's doing all of these things that is.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000]  And then she says, he says, I resent make America great again.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000]  But that's the thing.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:20.000]  And, you know, that's another point, Alex, that is very prominent in the black community that has been dumbed down.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000]  You know, they tend to be anti-American.
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:27.000]  It amazes me when it's all our country folks.
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  And it's amazing.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  All right, Sheree Saber, you're awesome.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000]  Please come back again.
[02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  I'd love to have you do some reporting for us there in some of the other folks there in DC.
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:36.000]  God bless you.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  You're amazing.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  And by the way, that toothpaste, I absolutely love it.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000]  It's got to be my favorite.
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000]  I'm not like trying to do fun, but it's just.
[02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  I need to support it as high quality.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  It's 50% off right now.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  Super blue.
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  Sheree, you're awesome.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  And God bless you.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000]  Thank you.
[02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  We'll be right back with Dan Lyman.
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  Supposedly our boss.
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.000]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  Finally, someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow government ever.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:42.000]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people are.
[02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them the library, to give them the church.

[02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  All right, we're going to be talking to Dan Lyman, who heads up europewars.com.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000]  Our Europe Bureau, we're attempting to start and set up.
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:57.000]  We've got Paul over there in the UK as well.
[02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:04.000]  He went and did a great job solo shooting amazing footage and interviews in Davos this year,
[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.000]  when Trump stormed Davos and dominated it with his America First agenda.
[02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  You can see some of that HD footage. We can roll some of that for TV viewers.
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:20.000]  But I can sit here and make jokes about all this, but it's not funny.
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  BuzzFeed came out saying people that gave me the PP gate, OCA, and all that with John McCain
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  and said new Facebook features shows which pro-Trump Facebook pages are run from overseas.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  And they've got InfoWars, one of our pages, not ours, because it belongs to Facebook.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  We just built it and gave it all the attention, is run out of Switzerland.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  Well, nothing we do is run out of Switzerland, but we can put that article on screen and maybe show folks that.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  But Dan Lyman does live in Switzerland, and we do upload his stories from there.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  And I guess he posts them there. So in this new world, they call for us to be censored and blocked because of this.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  If we have a reporter go overseas, or I'm in Germany, or I'm in England, or I'm in Mexico, I guess,
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  I shoot a video, it now means Mexico runs InfoWars. So we all heard about the dreaded Russians,
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  but now we're learning about the dreaded Swiss, even though Dan Lyman's an American.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  And again, as a reporter goes and covers the president there.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:45.000]  Wow, that's normal, isn't it? But in the weird twisted world of BuzzFeed,
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  this is part of why people come to the street and go FU Russian.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  Also, he went to Australia for InfoWars and interviewed what folks are calling the Tommy Robinson over there.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:03.000]  Very successful outspoken fellow. Those are interviews we upload.
[02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  So imagine the witch hunt level. What was the witch hat? Well, she has a mole.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  This woman doesn't have a mole. She must have had it removed. Ah, yes. How do we know she's a witch?
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:19.000]  We tie Rockston, throw in the water, she'll float. If she sinks, she's not a witch.
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:25.000]  But that will kill her. But at least she's not a witch. This is beyond Monty Python now.
[02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.000]  So I made jokes about it yesterday, and I was listening to a rebroadcast last night.
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000]  I sometimes do, and I was like, you know, this isn't funny.
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  And just the way they lie about Trump and us and just that.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.000]  And then the same day after I learned about that, and I guess we don't care anymore.
[02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  No one's written about it here. Paul hasn't. I don't care, I guess, anymore either.
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:56.000]  I haven't even published these yet. I'm going to do it after the show myself.
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:04.000]  Facebook starts telling prominent platforms and the Republican Party starting March 14th.
[02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000]  They'll no longer be able to advertise on our Facebook pages.
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  By the way, I never even knew they were. I guess Facebook's letting them target our listeners
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  because they're voters, they're activists. That's totally normal, totally legal.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  But notice now they've gone from the Russiagate to Cambridge Analytica doing public legal scraping
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:41.000]  to now, oh my God, Dan Lyman, he posted stories to the Facebook from Switzerland.
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:47.000]  And oh, now, by the way, starting the 24th, I've talked to five different groups now.
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  Major Republican Party groups, you name it.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  We all found out about it because Roger Stone tried to advertise that rascally rabbit.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  His evil book, How to Succeed in Life in Politics and Fashion, we sell it in 4store.com.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  He advertised his own money to our store and they said, oh, you can't advertise in 4store either.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  That's hate. But starting the 24th, which as we go into the midterms, six months after the midterms,
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  this is the major clampdown. It's here.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  And it's not just against info wars. We got a list of the other people that they told them.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:42.000]  Walter Andrew Breitbart, he still has a fan page that Ben Carson, Bill O'Reilly.
[02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  But we've known this since one o'clock yesterday. I'm not mad at the crew, I'm mad at myself.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.000]  And we're just like, okay, big deal. We're so used to being censored, we're just, we're kind of taking it now.
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  Remember what that globalist, the head of the fourth largest bank in the U.S. at the time,
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  first class flight to be on the view six, seven years ago, eight years ago.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  And it's the head banker, it's off record conversation. So I'm going to say his name.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  He said, Alex, you think people adapt and overcome all this? They're going to adapt to it.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  And you are too. He got up, he left. He said, we're going to beat you.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:31.000]  And you know what? He's right. We're adapting right here in info wars to just total absolute discrimination and banning.
[02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:35.000]  And we're not going to say crap. We don't even care because there's this view.
[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  And I love my crew and I love my, you know, I'm not bashing anybody, but boy, oh, look at this website.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  Well, they did. Oh, look at this. Oh, look at that. Never what we do is worth anything.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  And, and, and that's fine. But see, when you get too close to a problem, they finally are slow roasting everyone, slow roasting.
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  So let's go. And I'm not going to be sarcastic. I wasn't going to make the joke.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  Let's go to who they say is the secret head of info wars. Now, think of how asinine this is.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  And I'm not belittling Dan Lyme. He's a very talented guy, had his own political site, rock band, all those stuff.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.000]  He's a patriot. He lives in Europe with his wife. He's lived in other countries there as well.
[02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  But because some stories he wrote are uploaded, this is our Swiss controller.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  So this is how backward and dumb they think Americans are.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  We're, look, there at info wars run by some guy in Switzerland, honey.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  Man, it's, it's, it's that they think we're so dumb.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  They think we're so stupid.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  I'm not even mad. They're lying about us. It's that are we this dumb?
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  Do I think people are smarter than they are?
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:48.000]  That everybody else who's a big media operation has reporters in other countries that are big countries, right?
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  Like England and Switzerland and stuff, right?
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  Like I'm trying to set up bureaus all over the world. We're able to find the people.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  You know, that's what you do. You know, go cover Davos, stuff like that, cover, you know, things like that.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:06.000]  And they're turning that just all information is evil now from anybody else.
[02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:11.000]  This is so dangerous. This is so witch hunt. Dan Lyman. Wow.
[02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  You didn't know that you are now like the shadowy head of specter. Did you know that?
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  I could have sworn you were the boss, but according to BuzzFeed, I am. It's very strange.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  Well, you know, it's really who is the boss? The truth is the boss. Don't you just do whatever you want?
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000]  I trust you. But I mean, we're all just independently telling the truth there.
[02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:35.000]  Absolutely. And I want to make this point right off the bat that I found so interesting is that both of these quote unquote journalists
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  who wrote that article, they're based in Toronto, Canada. They're not even American. The irony is thick.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  Wow. I didn't even do that research myself. That's, that's it. Well, they're the globalists.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  They're the ones getting rid of nation states. So we're nationalists, but they're like, look, he's got somebody in Switzerland.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Like where's Pace Picante made San Antonio? Where's this other one made New York? Get a rope.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:00.000]  I mean, this is how dumb they think we are.
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:07.000]  I could have sworn they were all about globalism and being global, global citizens and digital nomadry and all that stuff.
[02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:12.000]  But apparently if you aren't living in the United States and working for info wars, then it must be disinformation.
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  I guess they're not, they've never heard of Paul Joseph Watson from London.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  Well, see, they're busy teaching us how to drink tea and how the Queens grant our media all the time.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:26.000]  So they know the brits don't scare us that much. So maybe, maybe the Swiss will.
[02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  Quite possibly. There are some Russians that come down here though. They're very fond of Switzerland.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.000]  They send their kids to school here and go skiing and shop.
[02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  So maybe eventually they're going to pull a link between me and the Russians that come to Switzerland and info wars somehow somewhere down the line.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.000]  Well, yeah, maybe you saw a Russian once, right? Like, yeah.
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  Yeah, or a Russian vodka or a Russian dressing. The jokes go on and on.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  They do. We'll, we'll, we'll let Dan Lyman get into this when we come back. It's just next level deception, man.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  The mainstream media. Wow.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  Info wars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:09.000]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  eye comfort and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting,
[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:49.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:55.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  Garrison visited us about three weeks ago. He said that he was working on a masterpiece. Kind of along the continual, crazy stairwell of M.C. Escher.
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:48:00.000]  A piece of work, and it really illustrates so much. It's a great thing to get young people informed. Adults will enjoy it too, but this is the way you get young people into politics,
[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  and they really understand things through allegories. But it is a powerful, it's from Ben Garrison Graphics.com,
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:18.000]  and he'll be joining us again very, very soon. We're going to be working with him more in the future with an incredible talent along with his wife.
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:27.000]  I want to hit some positive news too, and then I know who the Leaguers are in the White House. I'm going to exclusively give it to you.
[02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:36.000]  When we start the next hour with Paul Joseph Watson, going back to Dan Lyman. Dan, I mean, you're an amazing camera person. You're a great writer. You're prolific.
[02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:46.000]  We're trying to develop, getting a crew for you out there so you can do more. We're trying to fund that as well, but we've decided to move forward with that.
[02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  I'm not whining that BuzzFeed lies. We know they lie. It's just to see them building the framework and then through Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter,
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:07.000]  beginning to really shadow ban and block, not just us, but everybody, built on the lie of look, and that they've got some weird program scanning where we're posting
[02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  and all they can find is an upload from Switzerland. And I asked the guys, they said they post your stuff on our Facebook. So let me just ask you on air.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  Do you have the codes to that Facebook? I mean, I'm glad you're uploading to it if you are. It's just that this is next level that they know we've got a reporter in Switzerland uploading stuff.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:38.000]  I mean, imagine that they had articles about CNN going and CNN's got reporters in 100 countries uploading to Facebook. They need to be banned. I mean, it's just, it's so illogical on so many fronts.
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  Well, I'm not mistaken. I went back and read through the article again today and it looks like it was a feature that Facebook rolled out prematurely by accident.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:55.000]  And what it did was it allowed the people that were using the feature to see how many administrators or managers a page had and then where they were all located.
[02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:03.000]  I don't not sure that it was based on posts because I've never posted anything to the Info Wars main page. I only use our European outlets on social media.
[02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  So if I'm not mistaken, while this ad was in use for the, I'm sorry, this feature was available for a temporary period of time, they must have gone immediately to look through a variety of different social media accounts to find out where they're being posted from and all that.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  And one of the ladies that wrote this article, ironically, her name looks quite Russian to me, if not from that area of the world.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:34.000]  A lot of her articles feature Info Wars content. I mean, she looks like she just sits on our page. So for a short period of time, this feature was available.
[02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:46.000]  Facebook mistakenly rolled it out and they went and checked on Info Wars immediately and found that somebody has access to the Info Wars Facebook page from Switzerland, although I have never personally used it.
[02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  Yeah, so this we're just guessing that that's, well, you are listed as an admin on Info Wars and on News Wars. So I guess it just sees an index of that and our interface with it.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:04.000]  I mean, it's almost like a hack then that Facebook's got to even know where our reporters are and what they're doing.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  And then BuzzFeed's calling for us to be banned because you're an American in Switzerland. It's so authoritarian. These people are so bad. They are just outrageously immoral bad people.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:27.000]  It is strange. And what if maybe somebody from staff that uses the social media accounts regularly was just using an IP address and had it landing in a different country.
[02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  It's just it's poor reporting in general.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  Oh, yeah. What about Info Vault 9 and all that where the CIA can go out and spoof stuff everywhere to make it look like the attacks are coming from Russia. Exactly. There's no end to this.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  Exactly. And they do this. They did the same thing that they do with everybody else when they, you know, just brand us as a conspiracy site.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:56.000]  They don't make any mention of the fact that we're an international news outlet that has broken countless amazing stories and just hard hitting news, TV show, obviously radio show.
[02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:08.000]  They just call us a conspiracy site. And then they roll us in with these tiny little like 5,000 like pro Trump Facebook pages and your newswire, which I think most people know as a disinformation site in general.
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:18.000]  And they just roll us all in together into the same thing to just further discredit us. It's just and then say Trump is attacking the press when he's pointing out CNN's totally fake.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  He's I'm telling you, they're the ones started this fight.
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  We've got some interesting news here. This is a breaking North Korea threatens to cancel Trump Kim summit over South Korea US military drills.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:38.000]  We'll be bringing you the very latest updates. North Korea is reportedly threatened to cancel the much anticipated Trump Kim summit over South Korea US military drills.
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:57.000]  According to South Korea news agency, Yon Hop News, North Korea says it has canceled high level talks planned for later in the day about the future talks. North Korea's central news agency said Max Thunder drills between South Korean US Air Forces are a rehearsal for
[02:52:57.000 --> 02:53:10.000]  invasion of the North and a provocation. I've been warning inner Korean ties. The state reports the high level talks were meant to take place on the southern side of the truce village to discuss follow up measures.
[02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  Kim Jong-un was said to have met with Donald Trump on June 12 in Singapore will be bringing you the latest and that's out of the daily mirror out of the mirror out of the UK.
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  But that is from the North Korean news. They're saying that separately satellite imagery will put this up on screen shows North Korea dismantling nuclear test site and they were about to blow it up next week.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:40.000]  So they definitely want the economic development that'd be better for their people. I'm not saying the regime is good. They're obviously horrible.
[02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  But it would be better to cut North Korea away from the Chinese industrialize it like the South and then they would obviously then have a way for Kim Jong-un and others to step down out of his hereditary dictatorship.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  That's the plan. But I certainly hope that this thing does not get derailed. And I had heard that Trump the South were going to stop the military drills until they'd actually had this meeting.
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  So I'll have to look and see if this big operation maximum thunder is actually going on. What do you make of that Dan Lyman.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  It's interesting. I know they were supposed to meet with the South today. Like you said I look on at the whole thing with trepidation not getting hopes up too much because we're dealing with a very slippery character here.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  But I would caution you to cover to not to cover too much North Korean news because Kim Jong-un actually went to school here in Switzerland. And if they connect through the one one degree of separation they might detect that info was also run out of North Korea.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:52.000]  Oh that's right. Kim Jong-un went to for at least 12 years to a boarding school there. We work for Kim Jong-un.
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  You know we can joke. Let me ask you this because I really don't know the answer. Should I get really angry about this or should I make jokes about it because we've got the word they're going to basically start kicking us off Facebook the 24th.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  They've already strangled it and everybody else too. So we can make jokes about this but it's not funny. I mean they're building this thing destroy our free speech based on insane witch hunt garbage.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:18.000]  So I think we should be pissed. I mean I'm really getting sick of these people.
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  I'm sick of them as well but I try to reserve my energy for the bigger battles. This one is just it makes these people look foolish. When you read through the articles you say how could grown adults be producing this kind of content.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:36.000]  But then you look at the other content they produce and it's like these quizzes about if you don't answer this many right year then you're mired in fake news or stuff like that.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:51.000]  I mean it's just horrible or is milk racist. Exactly. Just you know they always try to tie us in with like like these platforms like Gab and all they just pull us all into one bin and say far right neo Nazis and stuff.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  These people are pushing neo Marxist propaganda 24 seven. No one ever calls them out on that. So I think we can go back on the offensive against them with our own you know.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  Yeah we'll take gap. They got some really bad stuff on there. Some really good stuff. I get they're just trying to have an open platform. But but I know for people say well Milo Unopolis some of my real right wing listeners you know that guys and such.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:22.000]  Now Mike listen they're trying to platform him everywhere. I'm reaching out to everybody and that's what we're really trying to do here is is reach out to everybody and break this liberal cycle of infighting that they're trying to push.
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:35.000]  Definitely you have you have a side that is ideologically as vast as Kanye West to yourself to Dr. Michael Savage to Dave Rubin. I think everyone here is just tired of leftist authoritarianism.
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:51.000]  And we just want to be able to speak freely have free conversations where Chinese dresses to the to the prom if you'd like to or whatever it is that we want to do and do things respectfully and just have a nice time and not always have someone breathing down our neck with SJW garbage all the time.
[02:56:51.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  Exactly I never liked super right wing you know folks in my face telling me what to do but they didn't have any power. Man the left are like running everything and they're creepy and they lie and they're weird and statistically they rob and steal nine to six times more often
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:18.000]  and they're fake and they're dumb and they're hateful and they they hate poor people and they're pushing division their villains man their villains.
[02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  So true well there's definitely awakening going on and we look forward to being a part of that on a daily basis so we just have to keep on fighting.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:33.000]  Paul's coming up and I want to do five more minutes with you about other big things you're working on. I mean this be an article a day about Muslims raping little girls and getting away with it.
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  Now it's like articles every 10 minutes. I mean what in Hades is going on in like major countries legalizing Muslims raping 10 year old girls. I mean high court saying it will be right back.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  Guaranteeing your food independence is a crucial part of prepping between debt crisis natural disasters or even simple power outages having a supply of storeable meals is crucial with info wars life select storeable food.

[02:58:49.000 --> 02:59:06.000]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from info wars store.com you are funding the revolution.
[02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000]  I mean I cannot say it any clear.
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:22.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at info wars store.com and I want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:25.000]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.

[02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:49.000]  And there's satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:59:49.000 --> 03:00:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000]  So Paul Watson is taking over in the shower.
[03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  I'm briefly at the start of the next segment going to tell you who the leakers are in the wine house exclusively.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  So get ready for that.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  You know Trump's making a big deal about it is a big deal.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  Exclusively that's coming up but Paul Watson.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  You said earlier we were talking during the break you're a little upset.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000]  You know we've been working together 16 years.
[03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:46.000]  And according to the Buzzfeed logic that we should be banned because we're run from Switzerland because Dan Lyman is listed as a contributor to info wars.
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  He lives in Switzerland by that extension.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  You are actually the mastermind.
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.000]  So should we have a little bit of an argument here right now about who the foreign handlers are because I thought it was Russia.
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  But but now we learned it's Dan Lyman an American from Switzerland.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.000]  Well I mean Switzerland is a very scary country.
[03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:07.000]  I mean what's Switzerland known for you know gold Swiss chocolate cows.
[03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  I mean it's all very terrifying stuff Alex.
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  But yeah I've just looked it up when you told me about it.
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  Conspiracy website info wars which is a mass more than 900,000 likes has a manager in Switzerland.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000]  Oh my God hold the front page.
[03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000]  We're now being run by Swiss bots I imagine whatever they are.
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  So very terrifying stuff.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:34.000]  But the thing you sent to me earlier Alex was Facebook now denying ads from people who type in info wars as a target demographic.
[03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  And they're basically saying by May 24th I think it is that those will no longer be allowed on Facebook.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  So that could be a nice little band coming up for the info wars.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  And let's be clear we get no money from this.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  It's like with that idiot thinks islands float Hank Johnson told the poor diamond and silk you're making a ton of money off this honey.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  They're like we don't make anything off of it.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:00.000]  Facebook is this big using system using everybody.
[03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:06.000]  And then now Paul I think that signifies they're getting ready to get rid of us on the 24th.
[03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.000]  Well at least one of the pages maybe.
[03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:16.000]  And you've also got Twitter coming out today and saying it will hide conversations that detract from a positive environment.
[03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  Literally the most Orwellian language you can think of which is them admitting to shadow banning which they admitted to in the O'Keeffe tapes.
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  But then Twitter denied it.
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Now they've come out with a full policy saying they will hide certain tweets behind tabs if they deem them not to be adding to the conversation.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000]  Which of course is entirely subjective and could mean anything.
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:39.000]  And of course they're going to let the public face what they've been doing all along.
[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  They've been doing all along.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000]  They're going to let Spike Lee say horrible things about the president.
[03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  That's fine.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  But all of us were going to be shadow ban Paul.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  Exactly.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:50.000]  That's that's what I'm going to get into the Spike Lee thing again.
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  You know earlier today I tweeted if the dominant culture is pushing this America hating message 24 seven which it is.
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.000]  What can the counterculture be apart from pro-americana.
[03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  So we're seeing this again with the Spike Lee thing.
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:10.000]  We saw it with the childish Gambino video which has got 120 million views.
[03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  I've got a video coming out about that.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:15.000]  So it's all about attack America's bad and that's the dominant culture.
[03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:21.000]  So what else could the counterculture be than our resistance a backlash to that America has always been counterculture.
[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  That's what it was founded on.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  Yeah. But until now and we've now got Spike Lee saying that basically accusing Trump of not denouncing the rioters in Charlottesville which he plainly did.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  Even Time magazine admitted it.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  He said there were violence on both sides which is true.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.000]  You had auntie for bashing people over the head with bike locks and going to prison for it.
[03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.000]  You had Trump supporters being attacked across the board.
[03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  Another story about that today a black guy wearing a mega hat attacks screamed at counted out of a restaurant.
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  Yes there was violence on both sides.
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  And yes Trump denounced the white supremacist at Charlottesville.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000]  But Spike Lee claims he didn't.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:09.000]  And that's the basis for his entire Trump derangement syndrome surrounding this new movie which again celebrates denigrating America.
[03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  And it's being pushed and promulgated by the dominant culture where the counterculture saying that no.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:19.000]  Americana is the true source the true identity of America.
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:22.000]  We're going to defend that very definition of America.
[03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:25.000]  That's my foreign boss telling us Americana is number one.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  Clearly a foreign plot.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  And the American in Switzerland.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  Lyman I'm waiting for my orders ladies and gentlemen please as soon as possible I need to get my orders from Switzerland my friend.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000]  We'll be in touch.
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  Good commander.
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  Oh yeah I mean master.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000]  Leader.
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000]  How do you say that in Russian?
[03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  Main commandante or is that German too?
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:54.000]  I don't know I need to learn Russian if I'm under their control.
[03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000]  Frank in North Carolina thanks for holding so long.
[03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:57.000]  Go ahead.
[03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000]  Yeah I just have to say something man.
[03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:02.000]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast your bracket.
[03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000]  It just gets old man.
[03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:09.000]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:13.000]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down.
[03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:16.000]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm.
[03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  If that was happening to anybody else I'd be freaked out.
[03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  I mean what's it going to take us being shut down.
[03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000]  Is that what you want Frank?
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000]  You know what I was thinking.
[03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:30.000]  Hey Frank do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear.
[03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:31.000]  We're under attack.
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:32.000]  We need your help.
[03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:36.000]  As much bagging as I do we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:39.000]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000]  You understand I need your help Frank.
[03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000]  I need your help Frank.
[03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:49.000]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info war.
[03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  Do you understand I need your help Frank.
[03:05:51.000 --> 03:06:16.000]  Free press needs your help Frank.
[03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:40.000]  So when you're informed you know how the world works and you know that going back to the
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:50.000]  end of the first George W. Bush administration in like 2004 there were articles already in
[03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  Jane's weapons quarterly and then even in CNN about a year later that they would not
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:07:03.000]  allow any cell phones in the basically the White House period.
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:07.000]  And the people that did have them had to have blackberries because they didn't have apps
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:14.000]  because when you have somebody's app any time they want they can just open it up and then
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:18.000]  like a trojan horse have it do whatever they want.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:24.000]  There are tens of thousands of apps there are hundreds of prominent ones that have features
[03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:28.000]  that aren't even advertised where they can turn your microphone on and listen.
[03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:31.000]  Now this has been in the publications forever.
[03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:34.000]  This has been in the tech publications.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:39.000]  I would cover it and say hey the public should be aware of this and the media would go
[03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  Jones is insane he covers the camera on his computer then you know ten years later
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000]  Comey said do it.
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:50.000]  Jones is insane.
[03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:54.000]  He says take the battery out of your phone or put it inside a little Faraday cage if
[03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:59.000]  you don't want to be listened to tracked and listened to or watched because they can have
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  AI do it they have computers do it in live time and they create these logs of what you
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:08.000]  say and do that go on the databases you ask why because the companies in the deep state
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  want the data because they've got algorithms three years ago they announced that probably
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:23.000]  they had it ten years ago where Amazon knows with 99% surety when you're going to order
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  something before you order it and already has it packaged before you order it.
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  They know when you're going to pull into the liquor store they know when you're going to
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:35.000]  go to the steakhouse they know when you're going to go see your girlfriend they know
[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  everything they know the genre everything they've got it.
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:47.000]  So under Obama and under Bush before him there were no cell phones allowed in the White House
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:57.000]  and if you're a radio listener we're putting the articles on screen okay so I'm not just
[03:08:57.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  saying this so people keep saying there'll be four people in the meeting and then word
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:08.000]  for word it leaks so then the security people at the White House start demanding everybody's
[03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:12.000]  phones and looking to see if they recorded it or to see they have these special systems
[03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:17.000]  to see if they're on their phone in the meeting they'll bring the machines in and see if there's
[03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:21.000]  any live phones that's not how it works they've got a bunch of apps where you think it's a
[03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:26.000]  weather app or you think it's an exercise app or whatever the case is and it's got systems
[03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  that they can go in and activate it and then it activates the mic app it records it onto
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  the app then as soon as you leave it downloads it erases it in the app the recording app and
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:44.000]  then transmits it scrambled.
[03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:50.000]  That's ten years old that we know of so the president keeps freaking out saying I'm in
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:55.000]  meetings with two or three people and they know word for word what in the Hades is going
[03:09:55.000 --> 03:10:00.000]  on and then they say well they cut back last year to only some people having cell phones
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:11.000]  Mr. President you are probably one of the leakers because we know you've got two cell phones
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  they got you to get rid of one about a year ago which people thought was about you not
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  calling whoever you wanted that was part of it but it's also because you're the number
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:24.000]  one target in the world it's not foreign governments even do it it's Apple it's if you don't
[03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:31.000]  think that Bezos is spying on you sir you're crazy he's the richest man in the world he
[03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:38.000]  hates your guts Obama just got caught spying on you remember Mr. President back in January
[03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:41.000]  of last year I told you they're spying on you they're watching everything you're doing
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  it's Obama they're going for broke they're not going to stop they're going to make something
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:53.000]  up you got to move against them you already knew that too so Kelly's got a cell phone
[03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  Trump's got a cell phone they're in these meetings where nobody else has got them and
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  it's still getting out of the meeting word for word which is why Trump keeps thinking
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:05.000]  they're recording him yeah they're recording you but it's probably not even the people
[03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:10.000]  in the room most of the time they've gotten rid of most of those leakers so the media
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:15.000]  keeps playing dumb about oh who's doing it oh maybe it's Trump talking the media maybe
[03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.000]  it's well when he talks to media that's not leaking that's the president so they keep
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:25.000]  playing dumb saying where are the leakers and there's probably some humans still doing
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:32.000]  it as well leak or be leaked against but it's the phones and if you don't if they were
[03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:36.000]  going to spy on you when you were a candidate president elect and president you think it
[03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  ever stopped they got lasers on your windows listening they've got people inside they're
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:46.000]  paying off they're listening over the phones they're listening over the apps they've got
[03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  stuff over the smart TVs they can break into and the fact that I guarantee you've had
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  bug sniffers in there that went for old traditional bugs and wire taps that's not what you're
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:04.000]  going to get hit with it's the smart TVs it's the smart phones that's what's spying and
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  that's why they didn't allow them in the White House by Bush's second term it's why reporters
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  would get on Air Force One and they'd say take your batteries off and put your batteries
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:19.000]  in this bag and your cell phones in that bag and the bags were Faraday cages the bags were
[03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  lead lined or copper lined Paul I know you want to add to this but Trump is just has
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  bad advisors telling you because if they don't know that it's what the head of the CIA said
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:41.000]  six years ago we're going to listen to you over your appliances they can listen over
[03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:45.000]  people if they have power down power line in the area and the right transformers they
[03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:52.000]  can listen over light bulbs yes through the new light bulbs they can listen through anything
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  it's all resonance and it's all with sensors bouncing back up these light bulbs have special
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:03.000]  sensors in them and that those sensors can also be tuned with the data over power lines
[03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:08.000]  to give them an image it's the same thing there's thousands of ways as we get information
[03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:12.000]  singularity that they can listen to the president he needs to know that it's not the traditional
[03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  person in the room it is the AI robot Paul Watson what do you say to that my friend
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  well I mean Alex we put our articles in 2006 you're talking 12 years ago now about cameras
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:33.000]  on PCs computers listening to people's microphones asking access to people's microphones we were
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:37.000]  the first to talk about that and everyone was saying it was a tinfoil conspiracy theory
[03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:44.000]  2012 we put out an article Samsung TVs can be hacked to spy on viewers two years later
[03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  in 2014 they came out and admitted in their own global privacy policy policy that they
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  were recording personal conversations and sending them to third parties I was in their
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:01.000]  own privacy policy back in 2014 we reported on it at least two years before that so it's
[03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  not just the phones as he said and they're saying that they're keeping them locked in
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  just standard lockers somewhere in the White House before they go into the more secure areas
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  inside so they're not being protected from hacking as he said and as he said when you
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:20.000]  when you install apps it literally tells you we must have permission to access your microphone
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  for you to install this app we've had articles about that for years so this is a major problem
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:30.000]  obviously as he said a lot of the people inside that cabinet aren't very sophisticated when
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  it comes to technology and they're not seeing this as the threat in terms of leaking which
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:40.000]  is obviously you know going right over their heads and let's be clear senior staffers
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  still have the phones there's a reason for 40 years at the Capitol to have secret meetings
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:51.000]  they're in a bubble room totally guarded with 10 foot thick walls they've got seismic microphones
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  that can they got so much stuff it's insane the bottom line is Trump should only be having
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  secret conversations in a dome of silence and the word is they've got one in the basement
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  so that's it you can't have conversations in that White House the place is bugged by these
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  cell phones and in addition to that Alex a lot of them still blab to the media there's
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:21.000]  this whole narrative about Trump is trying to shut down the media and kill the First
[03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:25.000]  Amendment even in the CNN article about the phones which you were talking about they admit
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:30.000]  that they still talk to dozens of reporters on and off record throughout the entire day
[03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  stop blabbing to the reporters for your own ego that's another thing that they need to
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:39.000]  stop doing well plus a lot of that's singing in lies and says they have sources but yeah

[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:56.000]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves we can take our country back
[03:19:56.000 --> 03:20:20.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show we're all living in America unless you're Paul Watson then you're living in the UK and according to Buzzfeed that means he's our boss or that we're Russian or Swiss or something
[03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  we're all living in America and now from her Britannic Madison London Paul Joseph Watson
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:56.000]  thank you very much Alex this is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and Paul Joseph Watson we're going to start off with a question which I asked on Twitter early today which is if all the dominant culture does is to denigrate and trash America and western civilization which it does how can the counterculture be anything but pro America pro western civilization
[03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  and we see this again with this new Spike Lee movie which again is completely predicated on identity politics despite the fact that all the polls show all the reaction or the backlash to the NFL to the comedy shows to the award shows illustrates the fight that Americans are sick to the back teeth of identity politics
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:37.000]  but as long as the mainstream dominant culture can keep propping it up it can still grab the public's attention just like we saw with this movie black KK Klansman by Spike Lee and the video which was released about 10 days ago got about 120 million views already by childish Gambino
[03:21:37.000 --> 03:22:03.000]  called this is America which we're going to get into a bit later they see the tweet I sent to Spike Lee earlier where I said why are you lying by claiming Trump didn't announce the Charlottesville racist when he did because at the end of this movie black KK Klansman it features a montage of footage from the Charlottesville riots and the shocking horrific incident where one of the white supremacists drove a car into somebody and killed them
[03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  he claims and I'm going to go through the quotes here this is what Spike Lee said at the Cannes Film Festival yesterday quote we have a guy in the White House I'm not going to say his effing name we define that moment not just for Americans but for the world
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:33.000]  and that MFA was given the chance to say we're about love not hate and that MFA did not denounce the Klan the alt right the Nazis it was a defining moment and he could have said to the world not just to the United States that we were better than that
[03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:51.000]  well he did denounce the alt right he did denounce the racist in fact it's in the Time magazine headline right there they see another one Spike Lee on scorching black KK Klansman the profane littered profanity littered rent where he claims Trump did not denounce the alt right the white supremacist after Charlottesville he did
[03:22:51.000 --> 03:23:08.000]  Time magazine reported on it everybody reported on it he's but hurt about the fact that Trump said there had been violence on both sides of the alt right and the alt left which is completely true you had professors smashing people over the head with bike locks
[03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  you had Trump supporters being assaulted dragged out of cars we played the footage for two years on a regular basis you had the riot at Berkeley a Trump supporters not even Trump supporters just people who were there to support free speech with pepper sprayed maced in the face beaten with
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:42.000]  clubs that's what he was denouncing he also denounced the Charlottesville white supremacist racist for their violence he denounced both sides but now Spike Lee is basing his entire film on the premise that Trump didn't and that
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  Trump basically endorsed the KKK which barely even exists anymore in America as any kind of force and the alt right which barely even exists anymore in America as any kind of force as is proven by a tweet that I sent out earlier today about Richard Spencer
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:17.000]  who is widely renowned as being the leader of the alt right remember nobody even really knew what the alt right was certainly I didn't many other people didn't until the mainstream media that the Atlantic gave Richard Spencer and his crowd a platform in November 2016
[03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:34.000]  immediately after the election with this whole Heil Trump controversy when that definition of what the alt right was became mainstream became known and ever since then we've had this narrative about the rise of the alt right that it's taking over public discourse that
[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:52.000]  it's the return of neo-nazism in America complete and total BS the alt right is pathetic you can look at their numbers on any platform and see how pathetic they are I mean Richard Spencer's got like 2000 subscribers on YouTube that's pathetic
[03:24:52.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  so I mean people who started and have one half decent video can get more than 2000 subscribers in a matter of a week that's pathetic okay so Richard Spencer is being sued for Charlottesville by all these big law firms he tried to go out and raise $25,000 to pay his legal fees
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  for a start I mean he can't be really raking in a lot of money if he can't get if he can't afford $25,000 for a lawyer so Richard Spencer gets up on YouTube again the leader of the alt right this big scary force that's taking over American politics
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:44.000]  according to the media according to the left according to Spike Lee Richard Spencer gets up and tries to raise $25,000 for legal fees he puts out a video asking for donations on April 28 I believe it was he links the donation link in the description below the video
[03:25:44.000 --> 03:26:02.000]  well he doesn't quite link it because he doesn't even know how to put a link in a description box there's no there's no HTTPS colon so you can actually go to the link but the links there you have to copy and paste it again they don't have the proficiency or knowledge to actually know how to paste a link into a description box
[03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:20.000]  but never mind so they want $25,000 in legal fees over two weeks later nearly three weeks later how much as the big scary leader of the alt right being able to raise towards his $25,000 legal fee cost
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:38.000]  the pathetic poultry amount of $265 oh that's how big and scary the alt right is and Paul takes him three weeks to raise $265 and Paul it's a total garage Hillary introduces the term alt right and then says I'm in it
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  it calls me dark heart then they give attention to these nobody groups have three people their meetings then Soros funds the antifa who are a bunch of violent guns to come out there's more reporters covering the alt right than there are alt right ding dongs
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  this all happens and they act like it's the total end of the world and then projecting onto us and as you said no one follows Nazis it's the most uncool thing I mean it's it's unbelievable Paul I'm gonna I'm gonna get out of here but you're absolutely right
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  we have billions and billions of views millions of subscribers hundreds of TV stations radio stations all this and again they sit there and give this massive attention to these numbsculls
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:28.000]  yeah they wouldn't even have a platform if it wasn't for the mainstream media you go and look at the size of their platforms are virtually nonexistent
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:52.000]  I mean Alex I could do a tweet asking for support for legal for a legal fund after like 10 minutes I'd raise more than $265 on a tweet he puts out a video on his big main channel three weeks later $265 I mean I'm not trying to like
[03:27:52.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  double agents well it came out in Germany in the 2000s that the German federal government the intelligence agency was basically running the entirety of the far right in Germany so that's just standard operating procedure
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  but again they wouldn't have a platform they wouldn't have a bullhorn if not for the mainstream media you mentioned it you go to Richard Spencer's lectures you look at them on YouTube there are more cameras in the audience the actual attendees
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  you go to a Jordan Peterson Dave Rubin whoever lecture the standing room only their rock stars it's packed out but then they use that the alt right to attack those people it's guilt by association they never directly attack the alt right people they use them to smear us
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  the alt left the mainstream media needs the alt right it's the best friend they ever had
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:53.000]  they're such a foaming at the mouth radicals they have to invent this other radical group to not make themselves look so bad we're just promoting Americana and freedom well they're right back with Paul Watson stay with us

[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  premiered at the can film festival again he tied it into Charlottesville and lied by claiming Donald Trump didn't denounce the alt right didn't denounce the white supremacist who carried out violence during that riot during that rally in Charlottesville last summer he did
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:39:04.000]  that's the complete lie but again this is the whole theme this is the whole underpinning narrative of his movie the rise of the alt right we're explained there's no rise of the alt right it's completely pathetic they can't even raise more than $265 for their big legal
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:22.000]  defense in over three weeks that's pathetic that's not a rise that's not a huge audience of people that are supporting that movement is a pathetic dwindling tiny audience okay this entire contrived hysteria that the alt right is taking over American politics
[03:39:22.000 --> 03:39:40.000]  is complete BS they've hijacked it they've exploited it they never directly attacked the people in the alt right they just use them to smear us by guilt by association every single time meanwhile actual Trump supporters black Trump supporters are being
[03:39:40.000 --> 03:39:57.000]  attacked violently attacked basically screamed at told to leave businesses for wearing mega hats headline cheesecake factory employees attack black man for wearing mega hat witnesses say a mother's day employees at a cheesecake factory in Miami Florida Florida verbally
[03:39:57.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  attacked and made threatening gestures towards a black man who dined with his girlfriend's family simply because he was wearing a make America great again how according to multiple witnesses interviewed by the daily wire
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:23.000]  now this is a cheesecake factory located inside Daedal and mall 22 year old Eugenia Joseph was seated while wearing his mega hat and according to multiple witnesses a woman who worked at the restaurant walked up to him and started pointing at his
[03:40:23.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  hat signaling for other employees to come over the witch had commenced we've got one that can see imagine that why do they always attack people inside restaurants this is this is a theme with the left isn't it with the vicious nasty intolerant left
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:54.000]  they always go for people at the most opportune time for them at the most inopportune time for someone who's trying to have a quiet bit of cheesecake with a girlfriend is trying to go to a restaurant with their family family time that should be precious why would you get in someone's
[03:40:54.000 --> 03:41:10.000]  personal space in that situation I mean you must have been brought up very badly by your crappy parents because that's just downright rude that's what the left does over and over again why do they always do this so this woman this employee at the restaurant
[03:41:10.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  walks over to him starts pointing at him simply because he's wearing a red mega hat this black guy says her fingers was literally on top of his head we were all looking at her like what is happening one witness told the daily wire she was pointing at him calling her other
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:40.000]  workers telling them to look at this guy wearing a mega America great again had the horror at that point approximately a dozen or so employees approached the table and began making comments about the hat with some saying they wanted to punch Joseph in the face
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  again anybody who disagrees with me as Hitler you can punch them in the face who pushed that narrative for the past 18 months the left witnesses also alleged that some of the employees referred to him as the N word in their conversations among each other doesn't say whether these
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  employees were black or white and maybe in a mix of the two but they're jabbing fingers in his face calling him the N word threatening to punch him while he's trying to have a quiet piece of cheesecake with his girlfriend so then all the employees
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  started standing there saying things out loud like quote I'm going to knock his head in so hard that his hat's going to come off they had clenched fists they're making hand gestures that appeared to indicate he was ready to engage in a fistfight screaming in his face
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:45.000]  telling him to leave he eventually left this is the tolerance the tolerance of the old left remember Milo a couple of weeks ago was kicked out of a bar in New York simply for being Milo this is how you they treat people who dare express diversity of opinion even African

[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:29.000]  it's the alex jones show and now your host paul joseph watson we're back in the final segment of the alex jones show lie let's turn to europe now where there's a headline up on info wars dot com
[03:47:29.000 --> 03:47:47.000]  finland 93% of migrant sex crimes committed by migrants from islamic countries now finland has a foreign born population of around 5.5% they don't have massive immigration but the majority of those immigrants living in finland are from
[03:47:47.000 --> 03:48:03.000]  russia sweden estonia and other former soviet union countries so this is not a country that has an overwhelming number of migrants from muslim countries but a new study has found that 93% of sex crimes in finland committed by
[03:48:03.000 --> 03:48:22.000]  migrants are committed by migrants from islamic countries investigation by the country's police academy revealed that 1052 asylum asylum seekers were suspected of crimes in 2016 with two thirds of them being iraqis the figures also show that out of 116 suspects of sexual
[03:48:22.000 --> 03:48:42.000]  offenses 108 or 93% came from islamic countries like iraq afghanistan and morocco so again they don't have a huge population of muslim migrants living in finland and yet the sex crimes 93% of them the sex crimes committed by
[03:48:42.000 --> 03:48:56.000]  migrants are committed by ones from islamic countries what does that tell you about the nature of these migrants coming from these cultures coming from these belief systems might tell you that some cultures are better than others
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:16.000]  now remember finland suffered its first islamic terror attack in history the first one ever last year when 10 people were stabbed in central turku in southwest finland by a rejected moroccan asylum seeker so now that they've started to get quite a few more coming in from islamic countries the
[03:49:16.000 --> 03:49:32.000]  terror attacks begin despite this it was subsequently reported that finnish authorities would consider providing returning isis she had his apartments and social services to reintegrate them back into finnish society as we've seen happen in
[03:49:32.000 --> 03:49:48.000]  sweden and even in the uk despite the fact that there are what 20,000 potential terrorists roaming the streets but god forbid we should actually track them now there might be people making mean tweets and we need to focus on that
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  as we reported last week finland scandinavian neighbours sweden my favorite country will begin collecting statistics on the link between migrants and violent crime for the first time in over a decade the left was very unhappy about that gee i wonder why
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:21.000]  another story here out of london another acid attack in tower hamlets well what do you know tower hamlets being an area of london which has probably the highest migration rate out of the entire city man sprayed with noxious substance after meeting strangers who wanted to
[03:50:21.000 --> 03:50:34.000]  buy his phone police are hunting two thugs who sprayed a man in the face with acid after he met them to sell a mobile phone so basically this guy advertised his mobile phone for sale on a gum tree which is like a version of ebay
[03:50:34.000 --> 03:50:53.000]  two men came to his flat he opened the door they threw acid in his face or what was later found to be some kind of cleaning substance and they stole his phone this is the new culturally enriched london where crime rates have gone up according to latest figures
[03:50:53.000 --> 03:51:11.000]  by 44% in terms of homicides between 2017 and 2018 157 homicides which is a 44% rise from the previous year in addition to that youth homicides headline on this by the way is an unacceptable rise in violent crime in london
[03:51:11.000 --> 03:51:27.000]  Sadiq Khan urged to do more what he actually is doing is banning junk food ads on the underground because cheeseburgers pose a bigger threat than armed criminals apparently but the number of youth homicides has increased by 30% from
[03:51:27.000 --> 03:51:43.000]  26 in 2016 to 34 in 2017 also a 36% rise in personal robbery which is up from 22,000 to 30,000 so all the violent crime categories are going up but don't worry because Sadiq Khan the mayor of London has declared war on cheeseburgers
[03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:57.000]  committee chairman Steve O'Connell said the unacceptable rise in the most heinous crimes such as murder, street robbery and burglaries is deeply troubling and again Sadiq Khan has basically done nothing to address it
[03:51:57.000 --> 03:52:05.000]  they grilled him about it last week and he basically came out and said oh I put out a report about violent crime in London a year ago
[03:52:05.000 --> 03:52:15.000]  it's like okay then what are you actually going to do about it no no I put out a report a year ago okay well what are you actually going to do about it fight cheeseburgers that's what we're going to do about it
[03:52:15.000 --> 03:52:31.000]  woe betide you would see a beach body ad on the underground now they've replaced those with giant fatties as well because of body positivity and all that nonsense so we can see that but we can't look at cheeseburgers and we can't fight violent crime
[03:52:31.000 --> 03:52:43.000]  he's doing nothing about it Germans as a people do not exist so they cannot be betrayed says Green Party leader now if you remember we played a clip probably a couple of years ago now
[03:52:43.000 --> 03:52:57.000]  where Stephanie von Berg the then leader and believe leader of the German Green Party gets up in front of the Bundesstag the German parliament and says basically celebrates the fact that Germans will be a minority
[03:52:57.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  in ethnic minority in their own major cities is already the case in Frankfurt I believe within 20 years and she said this is a good thing they openly celebrated the fact that Germans would be a minority in their own cities within 20 years
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:31.000]  well now in a video interview with informer the new leader of the Green Party Robert Harbeck made controversial remarks denying the notion of a German people newspaper Jung for a height report so now denying the very existence of the identity of the German people
[03:53:31.000 --> 03:53:45.000]  when asked about the concept of the betrayal of the people Harbeck says that's a Nazi concept there is no people in consequence they cannot be a treason of the people it's a statement of anger that can be really divisive discriminatory and
[03:53:45.000 --> 03:54:01.000]  so even to say that there's a German identity anymore that there's a German ethnic group is to panda to Nazism according to the Green Party in Germany and they won't even recognize that the German people exist anymore
[03:54:01.000 --> 03:54:17.000]  so if the German people don't exist as an identity of people how could you possibly betray them by destroying their culture and replacing them with people from the Middle East it's not possible so they figured out a nice little semantical trick where they can justify changing
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:33.000]  Germany irreparably from what it used to be these remarks spot the anger from the right wing AFD party president York Mouthon who quickly responded quote of course the Germans exist as the Italians the Spanish the French and the Turks do the Green Party
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:49.000]  they've not yet accomplished their destructive goal which is the abolition of borders with Angela Merkel's willing support of course you went on to say our people survived the worst ideologies and have nothing to fear from a pseudo-intellectual Islamophile being a snob to the German people
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  so he's getting called out they're basically saying German people no longer exist so how can we betray them absolutely chilling Austria 8 year old girl tells teacher Allah prefers girls with a headscarf
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  the growing influence of Islam is leading to increasing number of problems in Austria schools Cronen Zeitung reports once each revealed in an interview with a journalist that an 8 year old girl refused to remove her headscarf because her mother had told her Allah prefers girls with headscarfs
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:35.000]  why do they make children wear headscarfs and hijabs well it's to to counter the male gaze so they're basically saying that you need to counter the natural inclination apparently that some men have from that culture from that belief system to rape children
[03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:43.000]  that's the fundamental basis of it it's completely sick now children should not be covered up in headscarfs and bags
[03:55:43.000 --> 03:55:51.000]  the influence of Islam has also been affecting teaching materials a teacher has reported that primary school student did not want to take her textbook home with her
[03:55:51.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  for fear that if her father saw the pictures of naked people in it presumably it was about anatomy he would kill her
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:14.000]  oh okay this is very tolerant this is this is the the religion of peace the the new the new feminist belief system that third wave feminists in the west are supporting literally out on the street chanting Alar Akbar in support of in another case
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:25.000]  a student broke out in tears saying that he could not open his book on the human anatomy because an angel sits on my shoulder and writes down everything I do that is good and evil when I open the book the angel writes down evil
[03:56:25.000 --> 03:56:38.000]  so their parents are telling them they can't even read scientific books they're telling them they can't remove their headscarfs this again goes to the fact of Islam in the west is turning into Islamism and people are becoming
[03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  not only more extreme in their beliefs but more extreme in their practices you see more and more women covering up this is not a belief system that's going to be reformed anytime soon
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:57:00.000]  it seems to be getting more extreme more indentured in its own in its own extremism in terms of not reintegrating with society not integrating with western society
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:11.000]  and that's why there's a lot of call and that's why there are many laws on the books in some European countries to ban headscarfs all together because a lot of these people just on integrating
[03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:27.000]  Italy's Salvini blasts EU interference after pressure on migrants though Italy had the election they've got a coalition potentially anti-U pro populist pro Italy and now Salvini the head of the northern league is telling the EU to shove it
[03:57:27.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  because they're saying they need to keep the mass migration policy in place which has been a complete disaster Salvini is saying no more power to him
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:43.000]  that's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour coming up next is war room with Owen Shroyer breaking news at info wars dot com
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:58:07.000]  Western Europe has already banned free speech and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK they're set to pass rules not a law that if you criticize Islam or gays you'll get six months in prison we know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK seeing it and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down taken off the web
[03:58:07.000 --> 03:58:19.000]  this late magazine has a professor and others saying go beyond censorship brainwash young people against info wars psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually know what we have to say
