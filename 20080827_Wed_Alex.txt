[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:36.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen we are back for the very first time it is Wednesday August 27th
[00:36.320 --> 00:43.000]  2008 I am Jason Burma sitting in today and tomorrow for Alex Jones and then Friday we're
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.760]  going to do a best of and play some clips that we did not play on the radio show from it Alex's
[00:47.760 --> 00:54.920]  adventures over at the DNC another jam-packed day yesterday Jones got on Russia today which is
[00:54.920 --> 01:02.760]  just a huge huge show all across the world he did numerous radio and TV interviews and he took
[01:02.760 --> 01:09.880]  over MSNBC for around three minutes and we're gonna be playing that later on but coming up right
[01:09.880 --> 01:16.640]  after this short break we're gonna go to Paul Craig Roberts and get his take on the Georgia
[01:16.640 --> 01:23.080]  Russia situation where it's going if it's gonna escalate if it's gonna de-escalate if we're gonna
[01:23.080 --> 01:33.320]  see another Cold War style era I don't know what to think you know obviously Saka's Vili is
[01:33.320 --> 01:40.360]  NATO hungry he's been trying to get into NATO for quite some time he is a globalist he had the
[01:40.360 --> 01:49.480]  third largest amount of troops in Iraq highly pro-us and he's a good speaker you know I keep
[01:49.480 --> 01:54.240]  going back to this but when I watched him and I watched him pretty much that whole week but the
[01:54.240 --> 01:59.720]  Glenn Beck interview with him really really stood out and you know what maybe we're gonna play some
[01:59.720 --> 02:05.480]  of that too because I do want to play that but he's sitting there with Glenn Beck he's talking
[02:05.480 --> 02:11.680]  about how you know they're living in this Orwellian world and Russia's lying and you can't trust them
[02:11.680 --> 02:17.960]  and there for freedom and democracy you know classic double-speak even uses the term double-speak
[02:17.960 --> 02:24.440]  and lo and behold all of a sudden in the third segment after he's been talking to Glenn Beck for
[02:24.440 --> 02:32.240]  you know 20 or so minutes he's like you got to understand Russia is against all this stuff this
[02:32.240 --> 02:36.320]  is about the future of Europe this is about the future of the new world order you know the new
[02:36.320 --> 02:42.280]  world order that does not exist so yeah I'm gonna have to send that clip over to John Harmon and
[02:42.280 --> 02:48.440]  we're gonna play that for Paul Craig Roberts when he comes on and Paul Craig Roberts has really done
[02:48.440 --> 02:53.640]  some amazing work over a counter punch and other publications as of recent I mean he's quite old
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.280]  school he's he's has a huge body of work but I've been reading his latest stuff and he's he's not
[02:59.280 --> 03:05.120]  really pulling any punches at all and thank God because we need people to tell it like it is tell
[03:05.120 --> 03:13.600]  the straight dope because 90% of the media is still parroting that Russia is the aggressor poor
[03:13.600 --> 03:21.360]  little old Georgia how dare Russia go into South Ossetia and then into Georgia know they wanted
[03:21.360 --> 03:26.200]  to South Ossetia when Georgia began ethnically cleansing the citizens there after they had
[03:26.200 --> 03:31.280]  run some drills basically before they'd run the drills were moving in radar equipment other
[03:31.280 --> 03:35.600]  military equipment then US special forces are there Israeli special forces are there they
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.640]  start running these drills now to counteract these drills Georgia starts running drills on
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.800]  their border as well kind of figuring that there will be some kind of an altercation or
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.360]  aggression and sure enough you know and a lot of people we had a caller yesterday call in and
[03:49.360 --> 03:54.320]  say well how do you know that Russia is in set and this whole thing up well a 12 year old girl
[03:54.320 --> 04:02.800]  from San Francisco gets on Fox News says that she's in South Ossetia and all of a sudden they're
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.840]  they're attacked by the Georgians they had to spend the night in her grandfather's basement and
[04:08.840 --> 04:12.440]  then the next day the Russian troops are the ones that got her out of the country into Russia and
[04:12.440 --> 04:19.000]  onto a plane into the United States and they cut her off that accompanied with Sakosvili's
[04:19.000 --> 04:28.040]  little New World Order slip up you know make me about 99.9999% certain that Russia in this
[04:28.040 --> 04:34.200]  case is not the aggressor and we have Papu Cannon one of the most mainline politicians out there
[04:34.200 --> 04:40.480]  one of the better Republicans I guess but he's done a huge piece on Georgia being the aggressor
[04:40.480 --> 04:45.960]  it's the Alex Jones show we'll be back after this with Paul Craig Roberts info wars dot com

[07:59.960 --> 08:03.960]  you know it's not the fact that I was targeted
[08:03.960 --> 08:07.960]  my people has been targeted and I couldn't care less whether I was targeted
[08:07.960 --> 08:10.960]  the worst thing was that I was standing there with my people
[08:10.960 --> 08:13.960]  they were bombed and I was just targeted like them
[08:13.960 --> 08:17.960]  and the elected president officially in charge of their protection I couldn't do anything about it
[08:17.960 --> 08:22.960]  but the point here is it's not about me it's about the idea of freedom
[08:22.960 --> 08:24.960]  it's about the future of the whole region
[08:24.960 --> 08:27.960]  it's about the future of Europe and the new world order
[08:27.960 --> 08:30.960]  and what I think is that no matter what russians do
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.960]  I told them and I was asking what would be my message to the russians
[08:34.960 --> 08:36.960]  I kept thinking about these days
[08:36.960 --> 08:38.960]  lately talking about the new world order
[08:38.960 --> 08:40.960]  the new world order that doesn't exist
[08:40.960 --> 08:43.960]  this idea of globalism this idea of global government
[08:43.960 --> 08:48.960]  and joining us now to comment on the entire situation in that region
[08:48.960 --> 08:50.960]  in Georgia, South Ossetia and Russia
[08:50.960 --> 08:52.960]  Paul Craig Roberts thanks for being here
[08:52.960 --> 08:53.960]  hey how are you?
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.960]  I am very very good and Alex has gone over your latest article on the air
[08:58.960 --> 09:01.960]  and I've read it and it's a bang up article
[09:01.960 --> 09:03.960]  I mean you're last like three or four
[09:03.960 --> 09:05.960]  you're really not pulling any punches at all
[09:05.960 --> 09:09.960]  well I'm just telling the truth
[09:09.960 --> 09:16.960]  but we are being led rather rapidly into a nuclear confrontation with Russia
[09:16.960 --> 09:19.960]  for no reason, no purpose
[09:19.960 --> 09:27.960]  other than an insane policy of the neocons for American hegemony
[09:27.960 --> 09:32.960]  and this is why I've never really thought much of the new world order
[09:32.960 --> 09:36.960]  because the only world order that the neocons
[09:36.960 --> 09:40.960]  that control American foreign policy are interested in is
[09:40.960 --> 09:43.960]  American hegemony, American rule
[09:43.960 --> 09:49.960]  and the United States that doesn't have the military or financial power
[09:49.960 --> 09:53.960]  to impose itself on the world
[09:53.960 --> 09:56.960]  we have to understand Russia is a big place
[09:56.960 --> 09:59.960]  and it's heavily armed and China is another big place
[09:59.960 --> 10:02.960]  and there are bankers who are totally dependent
[10:02.960 --> 10:05.960]  on Chinese financing of our consumption
[10:05.960 --> 10:10.960]  and of the daily operations of the federal government in Washington
[10:10.960 --> 10:13.960]  so you believe this could be it
[10:13.960 --> 10:16.960]  that they really do want this global nuclear insanity
[10:16.960 --> 10:19.960]  I don't know depending on how you look at World War 3, World War 4
[10:19.960 --> 10:22.960]  just like an apocalyptic conflict
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.960]  you really think this could happen?
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.960]  I think we're very close to it
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.960]  I would give it almost a total certainty
[10:31.960 --> 10:33.960]  if John McCain gets an office
[10:33.960 --> 10:37.960]  the neoconservatives
[10:37.960 --> 10:41.960]  everyone should know by now are insane
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.960]  I mean remember now that the invasion of Iraq
[10:46.960 --> 10:50.960]  which was orchestrated in own lives and deception
[10:50.960 --> 10:53.960]  it was supposed to be a sixth week war
[10:53.960 --> 10:56.960]  and it's now in six years
[10:56.960 --> 11:02.960]  and the war in Afghanistan is going on
[11:02.960 --> 11:04.960]  what do you think about these latest proposals
[11:04.960 --> 11:07.960]  where they're saying that in 2012 now
[11:07.960 --> 11:09.960]  is going to be the complete de-escalation
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.960]  but then when you read further into the policy
[11:11.960 --> 11:14.960]  they say that they're going to just slowly start retracting troops there
[11:14.960 --> 11:16.960]  and it'll be over another three year period
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.960]  so now we're looking publicly at being in Iraq until 2015
[11:21.960 --> 11:24.960]  well I don't think that will happen
[11:24.960 --> 11:28.960]  what the Iraqis have done
[11:28.960 --> 11:35.960]  is to stop their fighting among themselves
[11:35.960 --> 11:41.960]  in order to undermine the Bush regime propaganda
[11:41.960 --> 11:45.960]  that our troops are necessary there to prevent a bloodbath
[11:45.960 --> 11:51.960]  so having already cleansed each other from their neighborhoods
[11:51.960 --> 11:54.960]  the Sunnis and the Shiites
[11:54.960 --> 11:59.960]  they've decided hey we're stopping this
[11:59.960 --> 12:05.960]  Al-Sader was told by the Iranians to stand down his militias
[12:05.960 --> 12:13.960]  and to create the absence of the kind of conflict
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.960]  that the Bush administration was using to justify its continued presence
[12:18.960 --> 12:23.960]  so that is the policy and we can see that our puppet president there
[12:23.960 --> 12:25.960]  is less and less a puppet
[12:25.960 --> 12:30.960]  more and more a spokesman for the Shiites and for Iraq
[12:30.960 --> 12:37.960]  and is insisting on the time schedule withdrawal
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.960]  and so I think if we try to stay there
[12:42.960 --> 12:46.960]  against this opposition
[12:46.960 --> 12:49.960]  that the war will start over and this time
[12:49.960 --> 12:53.960]  most of the fighting will not be the Shiites and the Sunnis
[12:53.960 --> 12:57.960]  killing each other but they will both jump on us
[12:57.960 --> 13:00.960]  and we will be driven out
[13:00.960 --> 13:04.960]  the only reason we weren't driven out is that we never had to deal
[13:04.960 --> 13:07.960]  with more than a few thousand insurgents
[13:07.960 --> 13:13.960]  because the Iraqis were mainly fighting each other
[13:13.960 --> 13:16.960]  cleansing each other of neighborhoods
[13:16.960 --> 13:19.960]  and gave us very little attention
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.960]  so you think our policy of divide and conquer is eventually going to fail
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.960]  and that these people are going to unify and really try to drive us out
[13:26.960 --> 13:28.960]  but I mean when do you think that could happen?
[13:28.960 --> 13:30.960]  we just keep pushing the date back
[13:30.960 --> 13:33.960]  look we're deluded
[13:33.960 --> 13:35.960]  we've always been deluded
[13:35.960 --> 13:38.960]  we said it's going to be a sixth week war
[13:38.960 --> 13:40.960]  we're deluded
[13:40.960 --> 13:42.960]  we've been deluded about the war
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.960]  we're deluded about a surge
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.960]  all that happened is what I said
[13:47.960 --> 13:51.960]  they had finished cleansing the neighborhoods
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.960]  and the Sunnis, the Sunnis insurgents
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.960]  were all put on the American payroll
[13:57.960 --> 14:01.960]  we have 80,000 of them now that we pay
[14:01.960 --> 14:07.960]  and so that stopped their interest in fighting
[14:07.960 --> 14:11.960]  and the Shiites are now unified
[14:11.960 --> 14:14.960]  with Iranian advice and backing
[14:14.960 --> 14:17.960]  to stop conflict
[14:17.960 --> 14:20.960]  so that it deprives Bush
[14:20.960 --> 14:23.960]  or the Americans in general
[14:23.960 --> 14:26.960]  of the propaganda
[14:26.960 --> 14:28.960]  that if we aren't there there'll be a bloodshed
[14:28.960 --> 14:31.960]  there'll be a bloodletting and so on and so on
[14:31.960 --> 14:38.960]  so as long as that is the situation
[14:38.960 --> 14:41.960]  there's no excuse for the American troops to be there
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.960]  therefore if we try to stay and stay and stay
[14:45.960 --> 14:50.960]  I think we'll see that the Iraqi government
[14:50.960 --> 14:53.960]  and the Shiites will turn against us
[14:53.960 --> 14:58.960]  and we never were faced with much opposition
[14:58.960 --> 15:02.960]  from the Shiites because that's the vast majority of them
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.960]  and they didn't really oppose us because they knew
[15:04.960 --> 15:07.960]  they were going to inherit the power from the Sunnis
[15:07.960 --> 15:10.960]  from our presence
[15:10.960 --> 15:14.960]  and they have
[15:14.960 --> 15:21.960]  and essentially we have ended the check on Iran
[15:21.960 --> 15:25.960]  that the Sunni secular government of Iraq presented
[15:25.960 --> 15:30.960]  and we've now put Iraq in the hands of the Shiites
[15:30.960 --> 15:32.960]  who are allied with Iran
[15:32.960 --> 15:36.960]  so they're not going to tolerate our permanent presence there
[15:36.960 --> 15:42.960]  whatever delusions the American government might have
[15:42.960 --> 15:45.960]  well where is Iran right now in this grand chess board
[15:45.960 --> 15:47.960]  I mean obviously focus has kind of shifted away
[15:47.960 --> 15:50.960]  with this conflict out in Russia
[15:50.960 --> 15:53.960]  but I mean we had Cheney it just came out with Hirsh
[15:53.960 --> 15:57.960]  about a month ago saying that he was prepared to dress
[15:57.960 --> 16:00.960]  I believe it was US Navy seals up like the enemy
[16:00.960 --> 16:03.960]  in little PT boats and have a firefight
[16:03.960 --> 16:05.960]  to try to provocate a war with Iran
[16:05.960 --> 16:06.960]  are we still going to go there
[16:06.960 --> 16:09.960]  are we still trying to get into that country
[16:09.960 --> 16:11.960]  yes we're still trying to
[16:11.960 --> 16:16.960]  well I'll say we, Cheney and the Neocons and Israel
[16:16.960 --> 16:21.960]  are still trying to provoke a war with Iran
[16:21.960 --> 16:28.960]  but now I think they're more interested in provoking Russia
[16:28.960 --> 16:34.960]  because the Russians have rejected the attempt
[16:34.960 --> 16:36.960]  by the Americans and the Israelis
[16:36.960 --> 16:41.960]  to exercise hegemony over them in Georgia
[16:41.960 --> 16:45.960]  and they've made it quite clear that they've rejected this
[16:45.960 --> 16:51.960]  and they've now recognized the two separatist provinces
[16:51.960 --> 16:54.960]  there's nothing we can do about it
[16:54.960 --> 16:58.960]  and what we will attempt to do is to proceed
[16:58.960 --> 17:01.960]  with putting missile bases in Poland
[17:01.960 --> 17:05.960]  Czechoslovakia and Kosovo and the Ukraine
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.960]  we will now take the efforts that were defeated
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.960]  by the Russians in Georgia to Ukraine
[17:13.960 --> 17:19.960]  and try to turn them into an American puppet state
[17:19.960 --> 17:22.960]  with missile bases on Russia's border
[17:22.960 --> 17:26.960]  and the Russians are probably not going to put over that either
[17:26.960 --> 17:30.960]  and so what we have is a very belligerent, aggressive
[17:30.960 --> 17:33.960]  American policy toward Russia
[17:33.960 --> 17:36.960]  which has thousands of nuclear weapons
[17:36.960 --> 17:42.960]  and it's already made it clear that they don't have
[17:42.960 --> 17:47.960]  the smart weapons and electronic warfare of the Americans
[17:47.960 --> 17:49.960]  and so if they're confronting that
[17:49.960 --> 17:54.960]  they're going to reply with tactical nukes to neutralize it
[17:54.960 --> 17:59.960]  we saw that in Georgia when they moved in those two SS-21s
[17:59.960 --> 18:02.960]  those are nuclear capable missiles
[18:02.960 --> 18:07.960]  so the American government with its insane policy
[18:07.960 --> 18:10.960]  that somehow it has to have a hedging enemy over Russia
[18:10.960 --> 18:15.960]  and boss Russia around is following a course of action
[18:15.960 --> 18:18.960]  that is going to provoke a nuclear confrontation with Russia
[18:18.960 --> 18:20.960]  and it's no reason for it, it's pointless
[18:20.960 --> 18:26.960]  it's an insane thing, it's like the old conquerors of
[18:26.960 --> 18:31.960]  1,000 years ago they just wanted to conquer somebody in rule
[18:31.960 --> 18:34.960]  they just wanted more control, again and again and again
[18:34.960 --> 18:36.960]  it was never enough control
[18:36.960 --> 18:42.960]  that's I think what is the neoconservative policy
[18:42.960 --> 18:43.960]  I have to agree with you there
[18:43.960 --> 18:46.960]  how do you think the globe is going to slice up though
[18:46.960 --> 18:48.960]  and who will be whose ally
[18:48.960 --> 18:51.960]  I mean I'd obviously think that in Europe allies
[18:51.960 --> 18:53.960]  you know Britain's obviously going to be our ally
[18:53.960 --> 18:56.960]  but I could see maybe France and Germany not siding with us
[18:56.960 --> 18:58.960]  I mean what do you think?
[18:58.960 --> 19:02.960]  Well obviously Russia and China will be allies
[19:02.960 --> 19:05.960]  and that neutralizes us right there
[19:05.960 --> 19:08.960]  the question then is what will Japan do
[19:08.960 --> 19:13.960]  will it eventually desert us remembering that they were nuked
[19:13.960 --> 19:20.960]  and here we are threatening more nuclear devastation somewhere else
[19:20.960 --> 19:23.960]  Europe, the leaders are bought, we buy them
[19:23.960 --> 19:29.960]  whoever they elect we make them rich so that they do what we want
[19:29.960 --> 19:32.960]  they always desert their own people
[19:32.960 --> 19:35.960]  they betray their own people because they get money from us
[19:35.960 --> 19:42.960]  so they'll likely, unless the fear of war with Russia
[19:42.960 --> 19:45.960]  breaks that, which it could do
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.960]  Alright we'll be back after this with more from Paul Craig Roberts
[19:49.960 --> 19:52.960]  Alex Jones show Infowars.com, PrismPlanet.tv
[20:23.960 --> 20:26.960]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again
[20:26.960 --> 20:30.960]  very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[20:30.960 --> 20:53.960]  and aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[20:53.960 --> 21:00.960]  whether you are with us or you are with the terrorists

[24:10.960 --> 24:14.960]  Alright folks, it is the Alex Jones show
[24:14.960 --> 24:17.960]  I'm Jason Burma, subbing in until Thursday and then Friday
[24:17.960 --> 24:18.960]  We're going to do a best of the week
[24:18.960 --> 24:20.960]  Alex down at the DNC going to be joining us shortly
[24:20.960 --> 24:24.960]  And we have no shortage of news clips of Alex Jones we're going to be playing
[24:24.960 --> 24:26.960]  After Paul Craig Roberts leaves us
[24:26.960 --> 24:29.960]  We have actually Alex on Russia today yesterday
[24:29.960 --> 24:32.960]  We have Michelle Malkin basically on Fox News
[24:32.960 --> 24:36.960]  Ripping into Alex, the 9-11 Truth Movement and others
[24:36.960 --> 24:39.960]  And Alex is probably going to be on Inside Edition today
[24:39.960 --> 24:41.960]  He's been non-stop over at the DNC
[24:41.960 --> 24:46.960]  You can watch live video streams over at infowars.com right now
[24:46.960 --> 24:48.960]  But we're talking to Paul Craig Roberts
[24:48.960 --> 24:54.960]  And we're talking about this global conflict with Russia
[24:54.960 --> 24:57.960]  And how the rest of the world is going to side
[24:57.960 --> 25:00.960]  If this does become quote unquote World War III, World War IV
[25:00.960 --> 25:01.960]  Whichever one you want
[25:01.960 --> 25:06.960]  And you know it's so hard to go over these things, predict these things
[25:06.960 --> 25:12.960]  But well, I mean obviously the outcome is going to be the end of American dominance, don't you think?
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.960]  Yes, and the end of life or...
[25:16.960 --> 25:19.960]  You have to take this seriously
[25:19.960 --> 25:25.960]  This is a far more serious situation than anything that we ever faced with the Soviet Union
[25:25.960 --> 25:30.960]  Because there was mutual assured destruction
[25:30.960 --> 25:36.960]  Neither side had any world dominant claims
[25:36.960 --> 25:40.960]  And they were sitting there as checks on one another
[25:40.960 --> 25:46.960]  What we have now is the United States with a world dominant claim
[25:46.960 --> 25:50.960]  And a war doctrine that supports that claim
[25:50.960 --> 25:56.960]  The Bush administration has already altered the American war doctrine
[25:56.960 --> 26:00.960]  In trying preemptive nuclear attack
[26:00.960 --> 26:04.960]  They have broken the agreement Reagan had with Gorbachev
[26:04.960 --> 26:11.960]  They're building anti-missile defense systems and are installing these on Russia's borders
[26:11.960 --> 26:15.960]  In an effort to negate the Soviet nuclear deterrents
[26:15.960 --> 26:20.960]  So that we can bully them and make them do what we want
[26:20.960 --> 26:22.960]  Now Russia will not stand still for this
[26:22.960 --> 26:24.960]  This is moving very rapidly
[26:24.960 --> 26:26.960]  This isn't something that's going to happen in the next 50 years
[26:26.960 --> 26:29.960]  It's going to happen in the next two or three years
[26:29.960 --> 26:33.960]  It's moving very rapidly toward a confrontation
[26:33.960 --> 26:40.960]  Now the idiots in Washington thought they were going to get away with ethnically cleansing Russians
[26:40.960 --> 26:44.960]  Out of those two Georgian provinces
[26:44.960 --> 26:47.960]  They actually thought that Russia would simply let this happen
[26:47.960 --> 26:48.960]  And they didn't
[26:48.960 --> 26:50.960]  They stopped it
[26:50.960 --> 26:52.960]  And now...
[26:52.960 --> 26:54.960]  And what was the American response?
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.960]  It very quickly gave more money to the Polish morons
[26:58.960 --> 27:01.960]  And got the agreement that the Poles wouldn't give them
[27:01.960 --> 27:05.960]  To put missile bases in Poland
[27:05.960 --> 27:09.960]  Russia has announced that, well, that may mean being in Poland
[27:09.960 --> 27:11.960]  They may simply new Poland
[27:11.960 --> 27:13.960]  Today the headline is
[27:13.960 --> 27:20.960]  Russia warns of military response to U.S. missiles
[27:20.960 --> 27:23.960]  Russia, angry with U.S.
[27:23.960 --> 27:26.960]  Takes up the Afghan attack at the UN
[27:26.960 --> 27:31.960]  We've murdered another 60 Afghan kids and 30 Afghan women
[27:31.960 --> 27:33.960]  Claiming they were Taliban
[27:33.960 --> 27:37.960]  And now it's all been proved that we did do that
[27:37.960 --> 27:40.960]  And the Russians now won't us condemn
[27:40.960 --> 27:47.960]  So they've become aggressive in response to our aggression
[27:47.960 --> 27:53.960]  And the neocons are the kinds of people who say
[27:53.960 --> 27:56.960]  What was Billy Crystal's statement, didn't he?
[27:56.960 --> 27:58.960]  Isn't he the one who said
[27:58.960 --> 28:01.960]  What's the use of having nuclear weapons if you can't use them?
[28:01.960 --> 28:03.960]  Yeah, the editor of the Weekly Standard
[28:03.960 --> 28:05.960]  And one of the big members of PNAC
[28:05.960 --> 28:08.960]  Right, this is the mentality
[28:08.960 --> 28:13.960]  It's the most insane criminal mentality
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.960]  And they control United States foreign policy
[28:17.960 --> 28:19.960]  So it means war
[28:19.960 --> 28:24.960]  You're headed very quickly into a nuclear war
[28:24.960 --> 28:26.960]  Very quickly
[28:26.960 --> 28:28.960]  What are we going to see in this country?
[28:28.960 --> 28:29.960]  Are we going to see conscription?
[28:29.960 --> 28:31.960]  Is it just going to be all out?
[28:31.960 --> 28:33.960]  No, there's not going to be time for conscription
[28:33.960 --> 28:34.960]  Or training and all that
[28:34.960 --> 28:35.960]  You're talking total chaos
[28:35.960 --> 28:37.960]  This is where they bring in their privatized forces
[28:37.960 --> 28:39.960]  NATO, the whole nine
[28:39.960 --> 28:40.960]  It's just a global conflict
[28:40.960 --> 28:42.960]  I'm talking about missiles that are going to launch
[28:42.960 --> 28:44.960]  You don't think there'll be anything left?
[28:44.960 --> 28:47.960]  You just don't think there'll be anything left of anything
[28:47.960 --> 28:51.960]  Nothing, because the radiation is just too deadly
[28:51.960 --> 28:52.960]  It's just too deadly, you know
[28:52.960 --> 28:55.960]  Look, we're not talking about little toy nuclear weapons
[28:55.960 --> 28:58.960]  That we dropped on Japan
[28:58.960 --> 29:01.960]  And we're talking about massive things
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.960]  If an SS-18 hit Washington
[29:06.960 --> 29:10.960]  It'd probably kill everybody from Boston to Atlanta
[29:10.960 --> 29:11.960]  My God
[29:11.960 --> 29:13.960]  So you have to understand
[29:13.960 --> 29:14.960]  This is a serious situation
[29:14.960 --> 29:16.960]  We have an insane government
[29:16.960 --> 29:21.960]  What is the United States government doing in Georgia?
[29:21.960 --> 29:22.960]  Well, Governor Roberts
[29:22.960 --> 29:24.960]  I know that you have to go after this segment
[29:24.960 --> 29:26.960]  Is there anything else you want to wrap it up with?
[29:26.960 --> 29:29.960]  No, I just think people need to be aware
[29:29.960 --> 29:31.960]  That this is a serious situation
[29:31.960 --> 29:32.960]  Very serious
[29:32.960 --> 29:34.960]  Well, the way you've described it
[29:34.960 --> 29:35.960]  It's the most serious I've heard
[29:35.960 --> 29:36.960]  And I thank you for your time

[31:01.960 --> 31:03.960]  Where everything goes right?
[31:03.960 --> 31:05.960]  First, I get the best parking space at work
[31:05.960 --> 31:08.960]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[31:08.960 --> 31:11.960]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney
[31:11.960 --> 31:13.960]  Finalized the contract in London
[31:13.960 --> 31:15.960]  And demoed our new product in Boston
[31:15.960 --> 31:18.960]  Online from my desk with WebEx

[31:20.960 --> 31:21.960]  From my desk

[33:47.960 --> 33:50.960]  With Paul Craig Roberts in the last two segments
[33:50.960 --> 33:53.960]  That's a reason to hit the
[33:53.960 --> 33:54.960]  Rebroadcast at infowars.com
[33:54.960 --> 33:56.960]  After the fourth hour right there
[33:56.960 --> 33:57.960]  I got chills right now
[33:57.960 --> 33:59.960]  I hope he's dead wrong
[33:59.960 --> 34:02.960]  I mean, he's literally talking about
[34:02.960 --> 34:04.960]  This country physically being wiped out
[34:04.960 --> 34:06.960]  Not the end of sovereignty
[34:06.960 --> 34:10.960]  Not us going to slave camps, us dead
[34:10.960 --> 34:12.960]  Man, that was a rough interview
[34:12.960 --> 34:15.960]  I'm not gonna lie, I'm still shaken by it
[34:15.960 --> 34:16.960]  See Alex Jones show
[34:16.960 --> 34:17.960]  I'm Jason Burma sitting in
[34:17.960 --> 34:20.960]  On Wednesday, August 27th, 2008
[34:20.960 --> 34:23.960]  Man, almost September 11th
[34:23.960 --> 34:25.960]  We're really close to the
[34:25.960 --> 34:27.960]  Every anniversary of that event
[34:27.960 --> 34:29.960]  And Alex Jones, myself and others
[34:29.960 --> 34:31.960]  Are gonna be down there September 10th
[34:31.960 --> 34:33.960]  Alex and myself are gonna be showing
[34:33.960 --> 34:36.960]  Truth Rising and Fabled Enemies
[34:36.960 --> 34:38.960]  With Luke Rudowsky's WeAreChanged.org
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.960]  You can go check that out
[34:40.960 --> 34:41.960]  At WeAreChanged.org
[34:41.960 --> 34:42.960]  It's 2008 now or never
[34:42.960 --> 34:44.960]  And there's a bunch more stuff going on
[34:44.960 --> 34:45.960]  Obviously on 9-11 itself
[34:45.960 --> 34:47.960]  And even after we've got some pretty
[34:47.960 --> 34:50.960]  Heavy hitting hip-hop artists
[34:50.960 --> 34:52.960]  For the weekend events
[34:52.960 --> 34:54.960]  So that being said
[34:54.960 --> 34:56.960]  We played a lot of the Malcolm V. Jones
[34:56.960 --> 34:58.960]  Clip we had Alex on
[34:58.960 --> 34:59.960]  Alex's gonna be calling in
[34:59.960 --> 35:01.960]  But Malcolm went on TV
[35:01.960 --> 35:04.960]  And spouted her vile, evil hatred
[35:04.960 --> 35:05.960]  So we're gonna play that
[35:05.960 --> 35:07.960]  And then we're also gonna play
[35:07.960 --> 35:09.960]  Alex on Russian TV
[35:09.960 --> 35:10.960]  Fitting after that
[35:10.960 --> 35:12.960]  Very hardcore conversation
[35:12.960 --> 35:13.960]  With Paul Craig Roberts
[35:13.960 --> 35:15.960]  Alright, let's cue up Malcolm
[35:15.960 --> 35:16.960]  Oh, Alex, never mind
[35:16.960 --> 35:17.960]  We won't cue up Malcolm
[35:17.960 --> 35:19.960]  We'll cue up Malcolm after we talk to Alex
[35:19.960 --> 35:21.960]  Alex, give us a report from the DNC
[35:21.960 --> 35:23.960]  Okay, number one
[35:23.960 --> 35:25.960]  We took over for a 45-minute
[35:25.960 --> 35:27.960]  Hardball with Chris Matthews
[35:27.960 --> 35:28.960]  There's 10-minute clips
[35:28.960 --> 35:29.960]  8-minute clips
[35:29.960 --> 35:30.960]  3-minute clips
[35:30.960 --> 35:31.960]  Different versions of it
[35:31.960 --> 35:32.960]  Or we chanted
[35:32.960 --> 35:33.960]  info-wars.com
[35:33.960 --> 35:34.960]  And Chris Matthews was live
[35:34.960 --> 35:35.960]  With a bullhorn
[35:35.960 --> 35:36.960]  And about 100 9-11 truthers
[35:36.960 --> 35:37.960]  At point blank range
[35:37.960 --> 35:39.960]  We had them threatening to arrest us again
[35:39.960 --> 35:41.960]  But we were on the city sidewalk
[35:41.960 --> 35:42.960]  Right up against it
[35:42.960 --> 35:43.960]  So they couldn't
[35:43.960 --> 35:44.960]  That happened
[35:44.960 --> 35:45.960]  We had two more days
[35:45.960 --> 35:46.960]  Of major reports here
[35:46.960 --> 35:47.960]  For you, ladies and gentlemen
[35:47.960 --> 35:49.960]  The Malcolm thing has just exploded
[35:49.960 --> 35:50.960]  She went on Fox News
[35:50.960 --> 35:51.960]  And attacked me
[35:51.960 --> 35:53.960]  Talked radio and blogs
[35:53.960 --> 35:54.960]  Or misrepresenting everywhere
[35:54.960 --> 35:55.960]  That I said killer
[35:55.960 --> 35:57.960]  But we have a major investigative
[35:57.960 --> 36:00.960]  Breakthrough inside
[36:00.960 --> 36:01.960]  Or is it extra
[36:01.960 --> 36:03.960]  Is about to show up here at the condo
[36:03.960 --> 36:04.960]  We're staying at
[36:04.960 --> 36:07.960]  We'll see if it's a hit piece or not
[36:07.960 --> 36:10.960]  We have a major investigative breakthrough
[36:10.960 --> 36:12.960]  Now with local newspaper photos
[36:12.960 --> 36:13.960]  We've seen
[36:13.960 --> 36:16.960]  And the video that we've found
[36:16.960 --> 36:18.960]  We now know
[36:18.960 --> 36:20.960]  That there were several people
[36:20.960 --> 36:21.960]  With Malcolm
[36:21.960 --> 36:22.960]  The big bodyguard
[36:22.960 --> 36:23.960]  Another guy with a mustache
[36:23.960 --> 36:24.960]  Who was a photographer
[36:24.960 --> 36:27.960]  And then some frat boy bloggers
[36:27.960 --> 36:28.960]  Who were with them
[36:28.960 --> 36:29.960]  Who were talking to them
[36:29.960 --> 36:30.960]  Who were getting what it looks like
[36:30.960 --> 36:31.960]  Orders from them
[36:31.960 --> 36:32.960]  They would come over and pose
[36:32.960 --> 36:33.960]  Behind me
[36:33.960 --> 36:34.960]  And say that they were with me
[36:34.960 --> 36:36.960]  Then some of them
[36:36.960 --> 36:37.960]  And some others start screaming
[36:37.960 --> 36:38.960]  Kill Michelle Malcolm
[36:38.960 --> 36:39.960]  Kill Michelle Malcolm
[36:39.960 --> 36:40.960]  Kill Michelle Malcolm
[36:40.960 --> 36:41.960]  And then they start saying
[36:41.960 --> 36:42.960]  Why are you saying
[36:42.960 --> 36:44.960]  Kill Michelle Malcolm
[36:44.960 --> 36:45.960]  Over and over again
[36:45.960 --> 36:49.960]  And just a massive, massive setup here
[36:49.960 --> 36:51.960]  And then we caught the same guy
[36:51.960 --> 36:52.960]  Following us yesterday
[36:52.960 --> 36:53.960]  On the street
[36:53.960 --> 36:54.960]  And we said
[36:54.960 --> 36:55.960]  Hey, that's the guy
[36:55.960 --> 36:57.960]  And this was all streamed live on the web
[36:57.960 --> 36:58.960]  So everybody saw it
[36:58.960 --> 37:00.960]  It's posted at info wars.com
[37:00.960 --> 37:02.960]  He ran off
[37:02.960 --> 37:04.960]  But the incredible thing about this is
[37:04.960 --> 37:07.960]  We now have footage of them saying
[37:07.960 --> 37:08.960]  Kill, kill, kill
[37:08.960 --> 37:10.960]  We now have the footage of them
[37:10.960 --> 37:12.960]  Then going to the police and saying
[37:12.960 --> 37:13.960]  Alex Jones says
[37:13.960 --> 37:15.960]  He wants to kill Michelle Malcolm
[37:15.960 --> 37:16.960]  Kill Michelle Malcolm
[37:16.960 --> 37:18.960]  So we have the type of dirty tricks
[37:18.960 --> 37:20.960]  They play on video for everybody
[37:20.960 --> 37:22.960]  And this is a big test to see
[37:22.960 --> 37:24.960]  Whether we can expose what they've done
[37:24.960 --> 37:27.960]  Whether we can, you know, basically
[37:27.960 --> 37:29.960]  Show the world what's really happening here
[37:29.960 --> 37:31.960]  Or will they have another propaganda victory
[37:31.960 --> 37:33.960]  It's kind of like a German talus
[37:33.960 --> 37:35.960]  Gary Talus was out there peacefully
[37:35.960 --> 37:36.960]  And got beat up
[37:36.960 --> 37:37.960]  And then the Fox News said
[37:37.960 --> 37:39.960]  He beat up somebody in a wheelchair
[37:39.960 --> 37:40.960]  Well, we didn't have any footage
[37:40.960 --> 37:42.960]  So we couldn't defeat that line
[37:42.960 --> 37:44.960]  This time we have the footage
[37:44.960 --> 37:47.960]  And I have I am the Kurt Nemo
[37:47.960 --> 37:49.960]  Local newspaper photos
[37:49.960 --> 37:51.960]  That show exactly what we talked about
[37:51.960 --> 37:52.960]  We also have the video
[37:52.960 --> 37:54.960]  Ourself, we're just so busy
[37:54.960 --> 37:56.960]  We haven't had time to dump from our hard cameras
[37:56.960 --> 37:58.960]  All we have is the feed live
[37:58.960 --> 38:00.960]  That's a limited perspective
[38:00.960 --> 38:01.960]  But from our other two cameras
[38:01.960 --> 38:02.960]  You really get a clear picture
[38:02.960 --> 38:04.960]  Of all these guys together
[38:04.960 --> 38:06.960]  All of them working in unison
[38:06.960 --> 38:09.960]  To, in their words, punk me
[38:09.960 --> 38:11.960]  To set me up
[38:11.960 --> 38:14.960]  And this is just absolutely unprecedented
[38:14.960 --> 38:16.960]  It's not just about Alex Jones
[38:16.960 --> 38:17.960]  News or Michelle Malkin
[38:17.960 --> 38:19.960]  This is about disinformation
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.960]  And how these people operate
[38:21.960 --> 38:24.960]  And the types of tricks that they traffic in
[38:24.960 --> 38:28.960]  But just unbelievable
[38:28.960 --> 38:30.960]  Unbelievable to see this happening
[38:30.960 --> 38:32.960]  But I really think that the
[38:32.960 --> 38:35.960]  Alex, you still with us?
[38:35.960 --> 38:36.960]  Can we get off?
[38:36.960 --> 38:37.960]  Okay, what was that last part?
[38:37.960 --> 38:38.960]  Just what we're about
[38:38.960 --> 38:39.960]  Just calling me so the phone's leaving
[38:39.960 --> 38:40.960]  Oh, gotcha
[38:40.960 --> 38:42.960]  I really think that the
[38:42.960 --> 38:44.960]  Big issue here is
[38:44.960 --> 38:46.960]  One of the other big issues
[38:46.960 --> 38:48.960]  Is the takeover of Chris Matthews
[38:48.960 --> 38:49.960]  Because he says on there
[38:49.960 --> 38:50.960]  Well, it's a free country
[38:50.960 --> 38:51.960]  This is how it is, folks
[38:51.960 --> 38:53.960]  You can tell this country's free
[38:53.960 --> 38:54.960]  And we sent you that clip
[38:54.960 --> 38:56.960]  And I want you to play it today
[38:56.960 --> 38:57.960]  We're gonna play it
[38:57.960 --> 39:02.960]  And meanwhile we had the
[39:02.960 --> 39:03.960]  NBC security saying
[39:03.960 --> 39:05.960]  Or NBC security stopped that
[39:05.960 --> 39:06.960]  We're gonna have you arrested
[39:06.960 --> 39:08.960]  And they went and told the police
[39:08.960 --> 39:09.960]  To arrest us
[39:09.960 --> 39:10.960]  And they moved in around us
[39:10.960 --> 39:11.960]  But did not arrest us
[39:11.960 --> 39:13.960]  So a lot more restrained
[39:13.960 --> 39:15.960]  What we've seen in New York City
[39:15.960 --> 39:16.960]  And in Ottawa
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.960]  And other areas around the world
[39:18.960 --> 39:20.960]  But I'm just so excited
[39:20.960 --> 39:21.960]  When I call them to show
[39:21.960 --> 39:23.960]  Because I'm in here in the condo
[39:23.960 --> 39:24.960]  With the guys
[39:24.960 --> 39:26.960]  And I'm watching them for the first time
[39:26.960 --> 39:27.960]  Review the live, you know, Chris
[39:27.960 --> 39:29.960]  High-definition video
[39:29.960 --> 39:31.960]  It is unbelievable
[39:31.960 --> 39:33.960]  How we caught these people
[39:33.960 --> 39:34.960]  In an elaborate setup
[39:34.960 --> 39:36.960]  And it turns out a day before
[39:36.960 --> 39:37.960]  Malcolm was in another
[39:37.960 --> 39:38.960]  Confrontation with people
[39:38.960 --> 39:40.960]  And their folks tried the same deal
[39:40.960 --> 39:42.960]  So you come up to Michelle Malcolm
[39:42.960 --> 39:44.960]  And you say, how dare you write books
[39:44.960 --> 39:45.960]  About putting Americans in camps
[39:45.960 --> 39:46.960]  How dare you be for torture
[39:46.960 --> 39:48.960]  How dare you say Alex Jones is a liar
[39:48.960 --> 39:50.960]  About the Marines filling the puppy
[39:50.960 --> 39:52.960]  You come up here for any reason
[39:52.960 --> 39:54.960]  They will have people start shouting out
[39:54.960 --> 39:56.960]  Kill Michelle Malcolm, kill Michelle Malcolm
[39:56.960 --> 39:58.960]  And then that albatross
[39:58.960 --> 39:59.960]  Will be hung around your neck
[39:59.960 --> 40:00.960]  What do you say to that, Jason?
[40:00.960 --> 40:02.960]  Well, it's a classic setup
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.960]  They're trying to diffuse the situation
[40:04.960 --> 40:06.960]  Of truth being spread among the people
[40:06.960 --> 40:08.960]  It's the same thing as, you know, the people
[40:08.960 --> 40:09.960]  That are getting the media attention
[40:09.960 --> 40:11.960]  Are dressed up like Mickey Mouse
[40:11.960 --> 40:12.960]  From Fantasia
[40:12.960 --> 40:14.960]  It's to discredit dissent
[40:14.960 --> 40:16.960]  It's to make the protesters look like fools
[40:16.960 --> 40:18.960]  For instance, I don't know if you've seen the clip yet
[40:18.960 --> 40:20.960]  Of the two Fox News reporters
[40:20.960 --> 40:22.960]  In the middle of about, I don't know
[40:22.960 --> 40:24.960]  30 or 40 protesters
[40:24.960 --> 40:25.960]  And they physically get a clap
[40:25.960 --> 40:26.960]  They're flipping everybody off
[40:26.960 --> 40:27.960]  And yelling and screaming
[40:27.960 --> 40:28.960]  Yeah, they're cursing out
[40:28.960 --> 40:29.960]  They don't have a message
[40:29.960 --> 40:31.960]  It's just like what you and Tom Martino
[40:31.960 --> 40:33.960]  Discussed yesterday on his radio show
[40:33.960 --> 40:36.960]  That these guys are total phonies
[40:36.960 --> 40:38.960]  They have no idea why they're out there
[40:38.960 --> 40:40.960]  I mean, you can't just sit there
[40:40.960 --> 40:42.960]  And start saying, you know,
[40:42.960 --> 40:44.960]  Take from the rich and give to the poor
[40:44.960 --> 40:46.960]  I mean, you've got to have a message
[40:46.960 --> 40:48.960]  You have to say, this is why we're here
[40:48.960 --> 40:49.960]  This is how we can win
[40:49.960 --> 40:50.960]  These guys are dressed like clowns
[40:50.960 --> 40:51.960]  They're dressed like anarchists
[40:51.960 --> 40:52.960]  They're trying to incite violence
[40:52.960 --> 40:53.960]  They're trying to swell
[40:53.960 --> 40:55.960]  They're going back to the Malcolm situation
[40:55.960 --> 40:57.960]  Then once it's proven that
[40:57.960 --> 40:59.960]  I didn't say kill Michelle Malcolm
[40:59.960 --> 41:01.960]  I was on John Gibson's radio show yesterday
[41:01.960 --> 41:03.960]  Malcolm was on before me
[41:03.960 --> 41:05.960]  And he says, well, so what if they were with her
[41:05.960 --> 41:07.960]  You influenced them
[41:07.960 --> 41:09.960]  You mind-controlled her people
[41:09.960 --> 41:10.960]  To say kill Malcolm
[41:10.960 --> 41:12.960]  So he's saying it isn't a setup
[41:12.960 --> 41:15.960]  He's saying I mind-controlled them
[41:15.960 --> 41:17.960]  Like the emperor from Star Wars
[41:17.960 --> 41:20.960]  To start screaming, kill Michelle Malcolm
[41:20.960 --> 41:22.960]  So they've been caught red-handed
[41:22.960 --> 41:23.960]  So then they fall back on
[41:23.960 --> 41:25.960]  Well, you were yelling and screaming at her
[41:25.960 --> 41:27.960]  Only after her bodyguard bumped into me
[41:27.960 --> 41:29.960]  Pushed on me
[41:29.960 --> 41:30.960]  I did push him back
[41:30.960 --> 41:31.960]  They loved to clip that out
[41:31.960 --> 41:32.960]  And just put that on the web
[41:32.960 --> 41:34.960]  We've got all this on tape
[41:34.960 --> 41:35.960]  Everybody trying to discredit us
[41:35.960 --> 41:36.960]  You're going to be discredited
[41:36.960 --> 41:37.960]  We have all the proof
[41:37.960 --> 41:39.960]  Listen, I want you to move the Kim Crow lady back
[41:39.960 --> 41:40.960]  30 minutes
[41:40.960 --> 41:42.960]  I want you to do coverage for the rest of this hour
[41:42.960 --> 41:43.960]  In 30 minutes to the next hour
[41:43.960 --> 41:46.960]  Playing the or select clips
[41:46.960 --> 41:48.960]  Of the MSNBC Hardball Chris Matthews
[41:48.960 --> 41:50.960]  Playing the Michelle Malcolm
[41:50.960 --> 41:51.960]  Fox News Clips
[41:51.960 --> 41:53.960]  And I've got you on Russia TV as well
[41:53.960 --> 41:55.960]  So we've got quite a few clips from yesterday
[41:55.960 --> 41:57.960]  I mean, you are really kicking some major butt
[41:57.960 --> 41:58.960]  Down at the DNC right now
[41:58.960 --> 42:01.960]  Well, we've got Extra coming over here right now
[42:01.960 --> 42:04.960]  We've got a bunch of other TV networks calling us
[42:04.960 --> 42:06.960]  But it looks like these are hit pieces
[42:06.960 --> 42:09.960]  It looks like that we are really
[42:09.960 --> 42:10.960]  Really under attack here
[42:10.960 --> 42:12.960]  They've been waiting for their chance to go after me
[42:12.960 --> 42:13.960]  In the national media
[42:13.960 --> 42:16.960]  And it looks like this is their attack pattern right now
[42:16.960 --> 42:18.960]  Folks, but I think it's going to blow up in their face
[42:18.960 --> 42:20.960]  Because the new information
[42:20.960 --> 42:21.960]  But I need Kurt Nemo
[42:21.960 --> 42:22.960]  I need Paul Watson
[42:22.960 --> 42:23.960]  I need Steve Watson
[42:23.960 --> 42:24.960]  I need you
[42:24.960 --> 42:26.960]  Full-time blogging after the show
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.960]  To analyze every facet and create a master
[42:29.960 --> 42:31.960]  You know, set Alex Jones
[42:31.960 --> 42:34.960]  A 9-11 Truth-Up page
[42:34.960 --> 42:36.960]  So that people can see all the intel
[42:36.960 --> 42:37.960]  All the data together
[42:37.960 --> 42:39.960]  And more and more of this is going to be coming up
[42:39.960 --> 42:40.960]  More and more information
[42:40.960 --> 42:43.960]  I mean, this is damning, Jason
[42:43.960 --> 42:45.960]  We have them setting me up
[42:45.960 --> 42:48.960]  Setting 9-11 Truth-Up saying we said kill, kill, kill
[42:48.960 --> 42:50.960]  When their people were doing it
[42:50.960 --> 42:51.960]  This is big
[42:51.960 --> 42:53.960]  I mean, we have them
[42:53.960 --> 42:55.960]  And then we have the national media
[42:55.960 --> 42:57.960]  Engaged in a hoax against myself
[42:57.960 --> 42:59.960]  And the 9-11 Truth movement
[42:59.960 --> 43:00.960]  But we're not going to stop
[43:00.960 --> 43:02.960]  We're going to go bullhorn other live TV events today
[43:02.960 --> 43:04.960]  We're going to go coverage against the machine
[43:04.960 --> 43:05.960]  In the next two hours
[43:05.960 --> 43:07.960]  Down at the park, Civic Center
[43:07.960 --> 43:10.960]  We are going to be doing other live radio interviews
[43:10.960 --> 43:13.960]  We are going to be throwing it into absolute high gear
[43:13.960 --> 43:15.960]  Here in the milehouse city
[43:15.960 --> 43:16.960]  With continual coverage
[43:16.960 --> 43:19.960]  At infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[43:19.960 --> 43:20.960]  We'll also be going live again
[43:20.960 --> 43:22.960]  Later today and this evening
[43:22.960 --> 43:23.960]  On our Justin TV channel
[43:23.960 --> 43:25.960]  That's linked up on infowars.com
[43:25.960 --> 43:27.960]  And prisonplanet.com
[43:27.960 --> 43:29.960]  We are on the front lines of the info war
[43:29.960 --> 43:30.960]  Ladies and gentlemen
[43:30.960 --> 43:32.960]  Alex Jones over and out
[43:32.960 --> 43:34.960]  All right, thank you very much, Alex
[43:34.960 --> 43:35.960]  And God bless
[43:35.960 --> 43:37.960]  All right, let's cue up that Malcolm clip right now
[43:37.960 --> 43:39.960]  And play that before we go out in the next segment
[43:39.960 --> 43:41.960]  And then we're going to push
[43:41.960 --> 43:43.960]  Rosalind Peterson back to 1230
[43:43.960 --> 43:45.960]  So we can cover more of this
[43:45.960 --> 43:47.960]  I'll say this, I'll take callers for Rosalind Peterson
[43:47.960 --> 43:49.960]  So if you're going to call on topic
[43:49.960 --> 43:51.960]  Because she was a huge guest
[43:51.960 --> 43:53.960]  And we're only going to be able to have her on
[43:53.960 --> 43:54.960]  For half an hour
[43:54.960 --> 43:56.960]  Let's take your calls on topic for that
[43:56.960 --> 43:57.960]  So if you want to talk to her
[43:57.960 --> 43:58.960]  You might want to call in a little early
[43:58.960 --> 43:59.960]  She'll be on in less than an hour
[43:59.960 --> 44:01.960]  Let's cue up Malcolm
[44:02.960 --> 44:03.960]  All right, welcome back
[44:03.960 --> 44:04.960]  16 minutes after the top of the hour
[44:04.960 --> 44:06.960]  Fox News contributor Griff Jenkins
[44:06.960 --> 44:07.960]  Was the only one in Denver
[44:07.960 --> 44:09.960]  Targeted by protesters at this week's
[44:09.960 --> 44:10.960]  Democratic National Convention
[44:10.960 --> 44:12.960]  Remember, he was sworn
[44:12.960 --> 44:14.960]  Look at what conservative blogger
[44:14.960 --> 44:16.960]  Michelle Malkin had to deal with
[44:16.960 --> 44:18.960]  As she sought to cover an attempt
[44:18.960 --> 44:20.960]  By anti-war protesters
[44:20.960 --> 44:23.960]  There to levitate the Denver Mint
[44:23.960 --> 44:25.960]  I didn't hear what you were saying
[44:25.960 --> 44:27.960]  Michelle Malkin called
[44:27.960 --> 44:29.960]  For putting Americans in camps
[44:29.960 --> 44:30.960]  She's right over there
[44:30.960 --> 44:31.960]  Where is she?
[44:31.960 --> 44:32.960]  Right there
[44:32.960 --> 44:34.960]  Michelle Malkin, Fox News
[44:34.960 --> 44:36.960]  Michelle Malkin, Fox News
[44:36.960 --> 44:37.960]  Was put Americans in camps
[44:37.960 --> 44:38.960]  She wrote a book called
[44:38.960 --> 44:39.960]  Where's she been?
[44:39.960 --> 44:40.960]  We're not in her case
[44:40.960 --> 44:42.960]  We're in your house, Michelle
[44:42.960 --> 44:45.960]  And Michelle Malkin joins us right now
[44:45.960 --> 44:47.960]  Who's that guy with the set of lungs on him?
[44:47.960 --> 44:50.960]  He's the leader of the 9-11 truth movement
[44:50.960 --> 44:52.960]  These are people who think that
[44:52.960 --> 44:53.960]  The government killed Americans
[44:53.960 --> 44:55.960]  And it was a big conspiracy
[44:55.960 --> 44:56.960]  This guy's a French talk show host
[44:56.960 --> 44:59.960]  And he showed up at what was supposed to be
[44:59.960 --> 45:01.960]  A peaceful event, Steve
[45:01.960 --> 45:04.960]  To levitate the Denver Mint
[45:04.960 --> 45:05.960]  I know, I agree
[45:05.960 --> 45:07.960]  There were a lot of really crazy people over there
[45:07.960 --> 45:09.960]  There was a guy dressed like Merlin
[45:09.960 --> 45:10.960]  I tried that out
[45:10.960 --> 45:13.960]  You had Harry Potter impersonators
[45:13.960 --> 45:15.960]  Actually, they were there to try
[45:15.960 --> 45:17.960]  And channel the spirit of Adam Hoffman
[45:17.960 --> 45:20.960]  Who did this in the late 60s at the Pentagon
[45:20.960 --> 45:22.960]  But it turned ugly
[45:22.960 --> 45:24.960]  And for the most part
[45:24.960 --> 45:28.960]  These protests have been fairly staked
[45:28.960 --> 45:30.960]  And the headline out of this
[45:30.960 --> 45:31.960]  And I wrote a column about it today
[45:31.960 --> 45:33.960]  Is that for the most part
[45:33.960 --> 45:36.960]  Recreate 68 has been an abysmal failure
[45:36.960 --> 45:37.960]  Let me get this straight
[45:37.960 --> 45:39.960]  So they want to have freedom of speech
[45:39.960 --> 45:40.960]  But you can't have it
[45:40.960 --> 45:42.960]  Right, while this guy is screaming
[45:42.960 --> 45:45.960]  That I'm a monster and an enemy of free speech
[45:45.960 --> 45:47.960]  You just have to laugh at it
[45:47.960 --> 45:50.960]  And I think that's one of the instructive things
[45:50.960 --> 45:52.960]  It's just what a self-mockery
[45:52.960 --> 45:54.960]  These people have made of themselves
[45:54.960 --> 45:57.960]  And this particular event
[45:57.960 --> 45:59.960]  Which I was there to cover as a blogger
[45:59.960 --> 46:00.960]  Turned out to be a failure
[46:00.960 --> 46:03.960]  And so opportunists seized the day
[46:03.960 --> 46:05.960]  And tried to make news out of it
[46:05.960 --> 46:07.960]  By attacking the media
[46:07.960 --> 46:10.960]  Sure, and we'd heard that there were going to be anarchists here
[46:10.960 --> 46:12.960]  And the streets were going to be clogged with protests
[46:12.960 --> 46:14.960]  It turned out, thankfully, it had been a dud
[46:14.960 --> 46:17.960]  Yeah, they promised 50,000 people
[46:17.960 --> 46:19.960]  And the police have done a good job
[46:19.960 --> 46:20.960]  Of maintaining order
[46:20.960 --> 46:22.960]  But in this particular case the other day
[46:22.960 --> 46:23.960]  When this happened
[46:23.960 --> 46:25.960]  They sort of just had a hands-off attitude
[46:25.960 --> 46:27.960]  Real briefly, as you walked around the DNC
[46:27.960 --> 46:29.960]  Have you had a nice reception?
[46:29.960 --> 46:32.960]  Well, there was that warm embrace
[46:32.960 --> 46:36.960]  Look for the most part, sure, from the business people
[46:36.960 --> 46:37.960]  Alright, very good
[46:37.960 --> 46:38.960]  Michelle, always a pleasure
[46:38.960 --> 46:39.960]  Her websites are
[46:39.960 --> 46:40.960]  Thank you very much
[46:40.960 --> 46:43.960]  Peter Ducey is going to be joining us in about 20 minutes
[46:43.960 --> 46:45.960]  Is anyone else sick to their stomach after hearing that
[46:45.960 --> 46:47.960]  Little vulture talk?
[46:47.960 --> 46:48.960]  First of all
[46:48.960 --> 46:51.960]  Please don't associate me and my group
[46:51.960 --> 46:54.960]  With somebody who dressed up like Mickey Mouse
[46:54.960 --> 46:56.960]  To levitate the mint, okay
[46:56.960 --> 46:59.960]  Those people are insane morons
[46:59.960 --> 47:01.960]  That's what they are
[47:01.960 --> 47:03.960]  And we're not on the fringe, Michelle
[47:03.960 --> 47:05.960]  Unfortunately, you're on the freak fringe
[47:05.960 --> 47:10.960]  You understand that Congress has less than a 15% approval rating?
[47:10.960 --> 47:12.960]  That you lie about it
[47:12.960 --> 47:14.960]  When our marines kill animals on tape
[47:14.960 --> 47:16.960]  And people, by the way
[47:16.960 --> 47:17.960]  Indiscriminately, yeah, it happens
[47:17.960 --> 47:18.960]  I'm sorry, folks
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.960]  I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you
[47:20.960 --> 47:22.960]  Alright, a lot of our troops over there
[47:22.960 --> 47:24.960]  Are totally mentally gone
[47:24.960 --> 47:26.960]  And they are killing innocent people
[47:26.960 --> 47:27.960]  Let's get them out of there
[47:27.960 --> 47:30.960]  Let's get them out of this crazy situation
[47:30.960 --> 47:32.960]  It's unbelievable to me
[47:32.960 --> 47:33.960]  I want to freak out
[47:33.960 --> 47:34.960]  I totally want to freak out
[47:34.960 --> 47:36.960]  We still got a couple minutes before the break
[47:36.960 --> 47:38.960]  So why don't we queue up some of that Matthews?
[47:38.960 --> 47:40.960]  Can we queue up some of the Matthews?
[47:40.960 --> 47:43.960]  Let's do it
[47:43.960 --> 47:47.960]  And then we just heard that Hardball was going live
[47:47.960 --> 47:48.960]  About five blocks away
[47:48.960 --> 47:49.960]  We rushed over there
[47:49.960 --> 47:50.960]  Took it over
[47:50.960 --> 47:51.960]  We are Change
[47:51.960 --> 47:53.960]  Infowars.com, folks
[47:53.960 --> 47:54.960]  Took it over
[47:54.960 --> 47:56.960]  It's up on Infowars.com
[47:56.960 --> 47:57.960]  Incredible
[47:57.960 --> 48:00.960]  Where, louder than Chris Matthews
[48:00.960 --> 48:01.960]  It's Infowars.com
[48:01.960 --> 48:02.960]  Infowars.com
[48:02.960 --> 48:03.960]  9-11 to the inside job
[48:03.960 --> 48:05.960]  9-11 to the inside job
[48:05.960 --> 48:07.960]  And they did the same thing they did in New York
[48:07.960 --> 48:13.960]  For sure, we are the second night of the Democratic National Convention
[48:13.960 --> 48:14.960]  Out here in Denver
[48:14.960 --> 48:16.960]  We've got some demonstrators out here
[48:16.960 --> 48:18.960]  It's a free country, as you can tell
[48:18.960 --> 48:19.960]  We've got blowhorns and everything
[48:19.960 --> 48:22.960]  We're going to try to ignore some of the crazier elements
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.960]  And hear from the people that are here
[48:24.960 --> 48:26.960]  Because of the convention that are paying attention to it
[48:26.960 --> 48:27.960]  And now we've got
[48:27.960 --> 48:30.960]  John Edwards, advisor
[48:30.960 --> 48:33.960]  And one of the most powerful men in California
[48:33.960 --> 48:36.960]  Los Angeles Mayor Antonia Villarigosa
[48:36.960 --> 48:37.960]  How are you?
[48:37.960 --> 48:38.960]  Thank you, sir
[48:38.960 --> 48:40.960]  We've had some fun together
[48:40.960 --> 48:43.960]  You know, I guess it's the old place to know
[48:43.960 --> 48:45.960]  Charities are thick
[48:45.960 --> 48:48.960]  Last night, I never saw so much care
[48:48.960 --> 48:50.960]  Michelle Obama
[48:50.960 --> 48:53.960]  She was downright fetching as a family member
[48:53.960 --> 48:54.960]  As a mother
[48:54.960 --> 48:56.960]  The children were divine
[48:56.960 --> 48:58.960]  The father was fatherly
[48:58.960 --> 48:59.960]  The father knows best
[48:59.960 --> 49:01.960]  The brother was the hostables
[49:01.960 --> 49:05.960]  Also, there was a great sentimental moment with Senator Candy
[49:05.960 --> 49:06.960]  Alright, let's cut it
[49:06.960 --> 49:07.960]  Let's cut the clip
[49:07.960 --> 49:08.960]  Alright, you got the idea
[49:08.960 --> 49:10.960]  And he did this for quite some time
[49:10.960 --> 49:11.960]  Infowars.com
[49:11.960 --> 49:13.960]  I think that's really the only time
[49:13.960 --> 49:15.960]  That Chris Matthews even addressed them
[49:15.960 --> 49:17.960]  It was pretty wild
[49:17.960 --> 49:19.960]  Obviously, you can't even hear what they're talking about
[49:19.960 --> 49:20.960]  Of Michelle Obama this
[49:20.960 --> 49:22.960]  All a bunch of left-right garbage
[49:22.960 --> 49:25.960]  You know, I watched a little bit inside the DNC yesterday
[49:25.960 --> 49:27.960]  On the mainline networks
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.960]  And it was just gross, disgusting, revolting
[49:32.960 --> 49:34.960]  To see all these little lemmings
[49:34.960 --> 49:37.960]  Ah, the Democrats are going to say
[49:37.960 --> 49:39.960]  Let's go inside the war
[49:39.960 --> 49:41.960]  No, they're not
[49:41.960 --> 49:43.960]  You didn't realize the Democrats
[49:43.960 --> 49:45.960]  Were not getting you out of the war
[49:45.960 --> 49:46.960]  Two years ago when you voted them in
[49:46.960 --> 49:47.960]  And nothing happened
[49:47.960 --> 49:49.960]  And Pelosi said impeachment was off the table
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.960]  Pelosi was part of the initial congressional investigation
[49:53.960 --> 49:54.960]  Into 9-11
[49:54.960 --> 49:55.960]  She's the problem
[49:55.960 --> 49:57.960]  She's openly new world order
[49:57.960 --> 49:59.960]  When she was a namespeaker of the House
[49:59.960 --> 50:01.960]  She talked about Novos Ordos Seclorum
[50:01.960 --> 50:03.960]  On the back of the dollar bill
[50:03.960 --> 50:05.960]  And how it was, you know
[50:05.960 --> 50:07.960]  She brings the founding fathers into it
[50:07.960 --> 50:08.960]  And blah, blah, blah, blah
[50:08.960 --> 50:09.960]  And then she did it again
[50:09.960 --> 50:12.960]  She's new world order, okay
[50:12.960 --> 50:15.960]  It's not just a wrestling tag team group, folks
[50:15.960 --> 50:16.960]  It's the real deal
[50:16.960 --> 50:18.960]  It's what all this is about
[50:18.960 --> 50:20.960]  It's about globalism
[50:20.960 --> 50:22.960]  And that's why I really hope that
[50:22.960 --> 50:24.960]  Paul Greg Roberts is wrong
[50:24.960 --> 50:26.960]  Because personally, I don't want to be blown up
[50:26.960 --> 50:28.960]  I don't know about you
[50:28.960 --> 50:31.960]  And if you missed that first segment interview
[50:31.960 --> 50:33.960]  It'll be in the refeed
[50:35.960 --> 50:37.960]  If he's right, we're all going to that spirit in the sky
[50:37.960 --> 50:38.960]  Not most of us, though
[50:38.960 --> 50:40.960]  Because we're all too greedy
[50:40.960 --> 50:42.960]  Too self-absorbed
[50:42.960 --> 50:43.960]  Too apathetic
[50:43.960 --> 50:45.960]  We don't really care what's going on
[50:46.960 --> 50:47.960]  Alright, we're going to come back
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.960]  We're going to play Alex on Russia TV today
[50:51.960 --> 50:53.960]  And a bunch more from the DNC
[50:53.960 --> 50:54.960]  Remember, he's streaming live
[50:54.960 --> 50:55.960]  Over at infowars.com
[50:55.960 --> 50:57.960]  And prisonplanet.tv
[50:57.960 --> 51:02.960]  Do you have doubts about the stability of the dollar
[51:02.960 --> 51:04.960]  Or your own financial future?
[51:04.960 --> 51:05.960]  Is a dismal growth rate
[51:05.960 --> 51:07.960]  Or rampant inflation affecting the bottom line
[51:07.960 --> 51:09.960]  Of your retirement savings accounts?
[51:09.960 --> 51:11.960]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events
[51:11.960 --> 51:13.960]  Which could suddenly wipe out some
[51:13.960 --> 51:14.960]  Or all of your hard earned savings?
[51:14.960 --> 51:16.960]  You can turn adversity into opportunity
[51:16.960 --> 51:19.960]  Digital retirement accounts and most 401k's
[51:19.960 --> 51:21.960]  403b's, seps and other retirement plans
[51:21.960 --> 51:24.960]  Can be rolled over into self-directed accounts
[51:24.960 --> 51:25.960]  Using gold and silver
[51:25.960 --> 51:27.960]  There are definitely some dos and don'ts
[51:27.960 --> 51:28.960]  With this rollover process
[51:28.960 --> 51:30.960]  And that's where Midas Resources comes in

[51:39.960 --> 51:41.960]  Even if other financial assets are failing
[51:41.960 --> 51:43.960]  It's not a question of
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.960]  If you'll need precious metals in your portfolio
[51:45.960 --> 51:47.960]  It's a question of when
[51:47.960 --> 51:48.960]  So whether you're planning for an

[52:00.960 --> 52:01.960]  A day unlike any other
[52:01.960 --> 52:03.960]  In the long course of American history
[52:03.960 --> 52:06.960]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[52:06.960 --> 52:09.960]  The enemies struck America on September 11th
[52:09.960 --> 52:11.960]  But who is the enemy?
[52:11.960 --> 52:12.960]  Bin Laden
[52:12.960 --> 52:13.960]  This is his MO
[52:13.960 --> 52:14.960]  We have to look to the Middle East
[52:14.960 --> 52:16.960]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[52:18.960 --> 52:20.960]  To take a close look at the terrorist ties
[52:20.960 --> 52:23.960]  To intelligence networks inside the United States
[52:23.960 --> 52:25.960]  Some U.S. investigators believe that
[52:25.960 --> 52:27.960]  There are Israelis again very much engaged
[52:27.960 --> 52:30.960]  In spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.960 --> 52:32.960]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[52:32.960 --> 52:34.960]  Have been detained
[52:34.960 --> 52:36.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[52:36.960 --> 52:38.960]  The hijackers' ties to the FBI
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.960]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[52:39.960 --> 52:41.960]  The Israeli intelligence network
[52:41.960 --> 52:42.960]  Warnings and war games

[53:01.960 --> 53:03.960]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[53:03.960 --> 53:05.960]  I can't find my wallet
[53:05.960 --> 53:06.960]  Sound familiar?

[54:33.960 --> 54:37.960]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back slaughter
[54:37.960 --> 54:38.960]  Alright
[54:38.960 --> 54:41.960]  We're back with the Alex Jones show
[54:41.960 --> 54:42.960]  I'm Jason Bermas
[54:42.960 --> 54:44.960]  Couple religious tunes on the way in and out
[54:44.960 --> 54:46.960]  You better believe it, man
[54:46.960 --> 54:48.960]  I believe we have a soul
[54:48.960 --> 54:50.960]  I believe there's good and evil
[54:50.960 --> 54:52.960]  And, you know, you ain't good
[54:52.960 --> 54:54.960]  If you go down to the DNC
[54:54.960 --> 54:56.960]  And start pushing around Fox News reporters
[54:56.960 --> 54:57.960]  And just cursing
[54:57.960 --> 55:00.960]  And have no message whatsoever
[55:00.960 --> 55:02.960]  Like the guy's going, do you have a message?
[55:02.960 --> 55:03.960]  Do you?
[55:03.960 --> 55:04.960]  We're idiots!
[55:04.960 --> 55:05.960]  We're morons!
[55:05.960 --> 55:08.960]  I'm glad that there are 50,000 people out there
[55:08.960 --> 55:09.960]  Acting like morons
[55:09.960 --> 55:10.960]  Good
[55:10.960 --> 55:12.960]  It only makes us look bad
[55:12.960 --> 55:14.960]  People with real issues, with real dissent
[55:14.960 --> 55:16.960]  Like I mentioned earlier
[55:16.960 --> 55:18.960]  Alex Jones was on Russia today
[55:18.960 --> 55:20.960]  On the situation in Georgia
[55:20.960 --> 55:23.960]  And we probably have just enough time to play that clip for you
[55:23.960 --> 55:25.960]  In this segment before we come back for the second hour
[55:25.960 --> 55:27.960]  So let's hit that clip
[55:27.960 --> 55:29.960]  While the shooting may be over
[55:29.960 --> 55:31.960]  The war of words continues
[55:31.960 --> 55:33.960]  Russia has criticized the Western media
[55:33.960 --> 55:36.960]  For what it has called its biased view on the conflict
[55:36.960 --> 55:39.960]  But not all journalists blame Russia for the conflict
[55:39.960 --> 55:42.960]  Alex Jones from the Infowars.com website claims
[55:42.960 --> 55:46.960]  American viewers have been deceived by the coverage
[55:46.960 --> 55:48.960]  First off, let me say
[55:48.960 --> 55:50.960]  I am ashamed as an American
[55:50.960 --> 55:53.960]  I'm a loyal American who loves my country
[55:53.960 --> 55:55.960]  But my country has been taken over
[55:55.960 --> 55:59.960]  By a private international military industrial complex
[55:59.960 --> 56:01.960]  And they launched the sneak attack
[56:01.960 --> 56:04.960]  On the Russian enclaves of Abkhazia
[56:04.960 --> 56:06.960]  And other areas, as you know, on 888
[56:06.960 --> 56:09.960]  Using the cover of the Olympic Games
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.960]  And a dastardly sneak attack
[56:11.960 --> 56:13.960]  On the order of Pearl Harbor
[56:13.960 --> 56:15.960]  In World War II
[56:15.960 --> 56:18.960]  And I am just so ashamed that our country has been hijacked
[56:18.960 --> 56:19.960]  As being used to do this
[56:19.960 --> 56:21.960]  I was watching foreign news
[56:21.960 --> 56:24.960]  And I knew that the US backed Georgians
[56:24.960 --> 56:26.960]  The Israeli and NATO backed Georgians
[56:26.960 --> 56:27.960]  Had snuck attack viciously
[56:27.960 --> 56:29.960]  And were hunting down and killing civilians
[56:29.960 --> 56:31.960]  Attacking the peacekeepers
[56:31.960 --> 56:33.960]  Just unprecedented crimes
[56:33.960 --> 56:35.960]  In our modern age, the 21st century
[56:35.960 --> 56:38.960]  And then I would turn on CNN and Fox
[56:38.960 --> 56:39.960]  And even BBC
[56:39.960 --> 56:41.960]  And they were reporting that Russia
[56:41.960 --> 56:42.960]  It was headlines
[56:42.960 --> 56:44.960]  Russia invades Georgia
[56:44.960 --> 56:46.960]  Russia sneak attacks
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.960]  And our leaders went on television
[56:48.960 --> 56:50.960]  And said that we would have to have a new Cold War
[56:50.960 --> 56:52.960]  It was such an insult
[56:52.960 --> 56:54.960]  The American people's intelligence
[56:54.960 --> 56:57.960]  That the United States backed Georgia
[56:57.960 --> 56:59.960]  And I apologize as an American
[56:59.960 --> 57:01.960]  That our government had been taken over like this
[57:01.960 --> 57:04.960]  And this is not the United States that I grew up in
[57:04.960 --> 57:07.960]  The neocons in NATO
[57:07.960 --> 57:09.960]  In the US and Israel
[57:09.960 --> 57:11.960]  Want to have a new Cold War
[57:11.960 --> 57:14.960]  I just hope Russia keeps troops in Georgia
[57:14.960 --> 57:16.960]  So no more sneak attacks can be long
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.960]  Because the dictator, and we know he was elected under fraud
[57:19.960 --> 57:22.960]  There in Georgia has said that he plans
[57:22.960 --> 57:25.960]  He said it last week to attack again
[57:25.960 --> 57:26.960]  As soon as he can
[57:26.960 --> 57:28.960]  So please, Russia does not need to leave
[57:28.960 --> 57:31.960]  These areas that have been part of Russia for years
[57:31.960 --> 57:34.960]  In Georgia and Ossetia, because we don't want violence
[57:34.960 --> 57:36.960]  The American people don't want this
[57:36.960 --> 57:38.960]  We want to be friends with Russia
[57:38.960 --> 57:40.960]  The Anglo-American western new order system
[57:40.960 --> 57:44.960]  Based in, of course, London and New York and DC
[57:44.960 --> 57:46.960]  They have hijacked the US
[57:46.960 --> 57:48.960]  They have implemented continuity of government
[57:48.960 --> 57:49.960]  They have geared up for Marshall
[57:49.960 --> 57:51.960]  Alex Jones telling it like it is
[57:51.960 --> 57:53.960]  Over on Russian television, folks
[57:53.960 --> 57:54.960]  There he is
[57:54.960 --> 57:56.960]  A bastion of freedom
[57:56.960 --> 57:57.960]  And free speech
[57:57.960 --> 57:59.960]  I love Alex, man
[57:59.960 --> 58:02.960]  I've seen a ton of positive commentaries
[58:02.960 --> 58:03.960]  On some of the message boards
[58:03.960 --> 58:05.960]  About what he's been doing in the DNC
[58:05.960 --> 58:07.960]  But there are always those back fighters
[58:07.960 --> 58:09.960]  Those haters, you know, those people
[58:09.960 --> 58:11.960]  That are raging with jealousy
[58:11.960 --> 58:13.960]  Or just insanity, in my opinion
[58:13.960 --> 58:15.960]  Alex is getting a ton of news coverage
[58:15.960 --> 58:17.960]  9-Eleven Truth is getting a ton of news coverage
[58:17.960 --> 58:20.960]  You know, he's making the international media
[58:20.960 --> 58:22.960]  Provocateurs are trying to set him up
[58:22.960 --> 58:23.960]  Of course he's being effective
[58:23.960 --> 58:26.960]  He's the most effective thing out there
[58:26.960 --> 58:28.960]  It is the Alex Jones show
[58:28.960 --> 58:29.960]  At the tip of the info war
[58:29.960 --> 58:30.960]  Here it is

[58:50.960 --> 58:52.960]  On September 11th, 2001
[58:52.960 --> 58:54.960]  Along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[58:54.960 --> 58:56.960]  I went to ground Sierra
[58:56.960 --> 58:58.960]  And we knew what to do
[58:58.960 --> 58:59.960]  Or at least we thought we did
[58:59.960 --> 59:02.960]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-Eleven film
[59:02.960 --> 59:04.960]  That finally gives first responders a platform
[59:04.960 --> 59:06.960]  To tell their story
[59:06.960 --> 59:10.960]  Whitman, EVA director
[59:10.960 --> 59:12.960]  On the AT made a statement
[59:12.960 --> 59:15.960]  That the air was safe to breathe
[59:15.960 --> 59:17.960]  This film follows the growing momentum
[59:17.960 --> 59:18.960]  Of 9-Eleven Truth
[59:18.960 --> 59:20.960]  As brave souls throughout the world
[59:20.960 --> 59:22.960]  Take action against their global masters
[59:22.960 --> 59:24.960]  He had his hand over the radio
[59:24.960 --> 59:25.960]  While he was getting a countdown
[59:25.960 --> 59:26.960]  He takes his hand off
[59:26.960 --> 59:27.960]  And you hear it
[59:27.960 --> 59:28.960]  Three, two, one
[59:28.960 --> 59:29.960]  And it was boom

[59:43.960 --> 59:45.960]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror
[59:45.960 --> 59:47.960]  They're going to commit more acts
[59:47.960 --> 59:49.960]  And bring in martial law
[59:49.960 --> 59:54.960]  Waging war on corruption
[59:54.960 --> 59:58.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:05.960]  Big brother
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:07.960]  Mainstream media
[1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:09.960]  Government cover-ups
[1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:10.960]  You want answers?
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:12.960]  Well, so does he
[1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:16.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:19.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:19.960 --> 1:00:21.960]  Alex Jones
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:22.960]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:25.960]  The info war has erupted
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:26.960]  In Denver, Colorado
[1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:28.960]  Thanks to one man, Alex Jones
[1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:32.960]  Alex is, I mean
[1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:33.960]  He's the man
[1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:34.960]  He took on Malkin
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:35.960]  Mainstream news coverage everywhere
[1:00:35.960 --> 1:00:36.960]  They tried to set him up
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:37.960]  They tried to say he tried to
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:39.960]  He said kill her
[1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:40.960]  It's been discredited already
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:41.960]  He's on John Gibson
[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:43.960]  Who has him on often, actually
[1:00:43.960 --> 1:00:45.960]  John Gibson trying to get the ratings
[1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:47.960]  Trying to, you know
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:48.960]  Say that Alex is a kook
[1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:49.960]  And this and that
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:50.960]  But he is one of the few people
[1:00:50.960 --> 1:00:52.960]  That'll actually give him a forum to speak
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:54.960]  As pompous as John Gibson is
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:55.960]  And Michelle Malkin
[1:00:55.960 --> 1:00:57.960]  We just played that clip
[1:00:57.960 --> 1:01:00.960]  You know, she tries to equate Alex Jones
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:02.960]  And, you know, the 9-Eleven Truth Movement
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:03.960]  With these people who were trying to
[1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:05.960]  Quote-unquote, levitate the mint
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:06.960]  No, that's not us
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:08.960]  We're in a place called reality
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:11.960]  We're not going to go levitate the mint
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:13.960]  In a Fantasia outfit
[1:01:13.960 --> 1:01:15.960]  Someone really
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:17.960]  I don't even know if they need to get
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:18.960]  You know, slapped in the mouth
[1:01:18.960 --> 1:01:19.960]  They're grown men
[1:01:19.960 --> 1:01:20.960]  The guy looks like he's like
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:22.960]  55, 60 years old
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:23.960]  I mean, is that really going to help that guy?
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:25.960]  Maybe he just needs to be put on a gurney
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:27.960]  And be hospitalized for the rest of his life
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:30.960]  If he thinks he's going to levitate the mint
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:31.960]  Unbelievable
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:33.960]  Oh, well, hey, you know what?
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:34.960]  Freedom of speech, right?
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:36.960]  You know, I guess you just want to be a moron
[1:01:36.960 --> 1:01:38.960]  And help set up, you know, other dissidents
[1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:40.960]  To make them look like morons
[1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:41.960]  And, you know, misguided people
[1:01:41.960 --> 1:01:43.960]  Look like anarchists
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:44.960]  And put on masks
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:45.960]  And try to incite violence
[1:01:45.960 --> 1:01:46.960]  That didn't work
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:48.960]  So you couldn't get your thousands and thousands
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:50.960]  Of people to, you know, ruin the streets
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.960]  So now let's just make us all look like idiots
[1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:54.960]  Let's try to levitate things
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  And wear clown outfits
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.960]  All right, I haven't done this
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:01:59.960]  In the whole first hour
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:01.960]  We had a riveting interview
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:02.960]  With Paul Craig Roberts
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:03.960]  Very scary interview
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:05.960]  There's an article up on prisonplanet.com
[1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:10.960]  Infowars.com about his view on the Russia situation
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:11.960]  And it is a grim view
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:14.960]  I'm not going to lie, I mean, he was...
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.960]  I've interviewed him like three or four times now
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  And that was about the most hardcore interview
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:19.960]  I think I've ever done on this show
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:22.960]  So that'll rebroadcast
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:24.960]  In the...
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:25.960]  After the fourth hour
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:27.960]  Right now I do want to plug my new film
[1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  Fabled Enemies
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:30.960]  It'll be dropping on prisonplanet.tv
[1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:31.960]  August 31st
[1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:34.960]  And it will be shipping out September 1st
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:41.960]  Without further ado, let's play the first trailer
[1:02:41.960 --> 1:02:44.960]  The relationship between Bin Laden and the CIA
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.960]  Was essentially...
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:47.960]  He was one of the assets
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:49.960]  One of the people they could turn to
[1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:50.960]  They wanted something done
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:52.960]  They wanted Bin Laden
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:53.960]  In the early 1980s
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:55.960]  Bin Laden worked with operatives
[1:02:55.960 --> 1:02:56.960]  From U.S. intelligence
[1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:58.960]  The Pakistani military
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:00.960]  And Arab states
[1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:01.960]  Is it not true
[1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:03.960]  That the United States government
[1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:06.960]  Payed $300 million to the Bin Laden family
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:09.960]  For the construction of the military camps?
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:15.960]  At basis though, I really think
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:17.960]  That these were more CIA assets
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:18.960]  People that were recruited
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:21.960]  Like all the folks I've been issuing visas to
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:24.960]  Then we have that mysterious suitcase
[1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:27.960]  With all of the hijackers' names
[1:03:27.960 --> 1:03:29.960]  And all of this incriminating evidence
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:30.960]  Why put a Quran?
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:31.960]  Why put flight manuals?
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:33.960]  Why put all this incriminating information
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:35.960]  If it's supposedly going to get burned up?
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:43.960]  Let's show you some video
[1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:46.960]  That was taken eight days after 9-11
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:49.960]  That man there is Osama Bin Laden's
[1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:51.960]  Younger brother Khalil
[1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:52.960]  And that family that took off
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  That's a f***ing crime
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.960]  I was surprised at the evidence
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:03:58.960]  That there were foreign governments involved
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.960]  Most of that information is classified
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.960]  I think overly classified
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:08.960]  Osama Bin Laden
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:09.960]  Osama Bin Laden
[1:04:09.960 --> 1:04:10.960]  Osama Bin Laden
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:11.960]  Osama Bin Laden
[1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:12.960]  Osama Bin Laden
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:13.960]  Osama Bin Laden
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:14.960]  Remember 24 hours ago
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.960]  It was the Bush tax cut
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:17.960]  The Bush budget
[1:04:17.960 --> 1:04:18.960]  The Bush economy
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:20.960]  You don't hear of any of that tonight
[1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:21.960]  It's America's enemy
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:23.960]  America's under attack
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:27.960]  Alright there you have it folks

[1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.960]  A terrorist act of war
[1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:06.960]  Against this country
[1:06:06.960 --> 1:06:09.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[1:06:09.960 --> 1:06:10.960]  But who is the enemy?
[1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:11.960]  bin Laden

[1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:23.960]  Inside the United States
[1:06:23.960 --> 1:06:24.960]  Some US investigators believe
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:25.960]  That there are Israelis again
[1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:27.960]  Very much engaged in spying

[1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:33.960]  Citizens have been detained
[1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:35.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA

[1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:27.960]  I am Jason Bermas sitting in
[1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  And a few months back when I was sitting in
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.960]  The guest on named Rosalind Peterson
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.960]  And she's really the foremost expert
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:36.960]  On chemtrails in my opinion
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:38.960]  And I just got a huge amount of email
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:40.960]  I got a huge amount of MySpace messages
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:42.960]  Saying how much they loved the guest
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:45.960]  So we're going to do one segment here with her
[1:08:45.960 --> 1:08:46.960]  And then we're going to take your questions
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.960]  On topic for her
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  Thanks for joining us, Rosalind
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:52.960]  Welcome, thank you for having me on your show
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:54.960]  It's going to be great, I can tell
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:55.960]  I mean, it was great last time
[1:08:55.960 --> 1:08:57.960]  I don't know what the response was for you
[1:08:57.960 --> 1:08:59.960]  But the response over at InfoWars
[1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:01.960]  Incredible, why don't you give a short bio
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:03.960]  And how you got into all this
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:07.960]  Well, starting in 2002
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:10.960]  I began to realize that
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:12.960]  There was a persistent jet contrails
[1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:15.960]  Showing up in the skies over Mendocino County
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:17.960]  In Northern California where I live
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:20.960]  And starting from that period on
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  I began to really become interested
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:27.960]  Because my background is in agriculture
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:30.960]  And I worked for the Mendocino County
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  Department of Agriculture
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:34.960]  I grew up and was born and raised
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:36.960]  On a working farm
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:38.960]  Where we had fruits and vegetables
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:41.960]  And walnuts, different types of crops
[1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:44.960]  And so then I went to work
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:47.960]  For the United States Department of Agriculture
[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.960]  In California at the Farm Service Agency
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:55.960]  As a certified agricultural crop loss adjuster
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:00.960]  So I traveled all over the state
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.960]  Looking at crop losses
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:05.960]  And making determinations about those
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:07.960]  For a period of time where I traveled
[1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  About 50,000 miles a year
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:13.960]  So that was quite interesting for me
[1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:16.960]  And then when I realized that the skies
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:19.960]  Were beginning to have man-made clouds
[1:10:19.960 --> 1:10:21.960]  Which according to NASA is
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:24.960]  When persistent jet contrails persist
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:26.960]  They turn into man-made clouds
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:28.960]  And that these man-made clouds
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:31.960]  According to NASA were exacerbating global warming
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:35.960]  And when I realized that we were on a drumbeat
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:38.960]  Across the nation and around the world
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.960]  To do something about global warming
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:43.960]  I was wondering why we didn't step up to the plate
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:47.960]  And stop these persistent jet contrails
[1:10:47.960 --> 1:10:51.960]  Because they were becoming more and more problematic
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:55.960]  In NASA studies over the past several years
[1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:58.960]  So that basically led you to believe
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.960]  That these were not really there to help us
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:03.960]  In other words, this wasn't really there to help humanity
[1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:05.960]  But it has some ulterior motive
[1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:09.960]  Well, I think it's an experiment
[1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:12.960]  In other words, in weather modification
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.960]  Because NASA even says that
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  These man-made clouds change our climate
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:21.960]  They will negatively impact natural resources
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:23.960]  Now and in the future
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:25.960]  According to their studies
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:27.960]  Which you can go on the NASA website
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  And just take a look, the studies are there
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.960]  I mean, they're not covering this up or anything
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.960]  They're pretty forthright with this
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:36.960]  And what I'm thinking is
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:39.960]  That when you add that these change our climate
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:43.960]  That contrails begin to
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:45.960]  Are warming us up
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:47.960]  They begin to keep direct sunlight
[1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:49.960]  From hitting the ground
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:52.960]  Which means that we're going to have a lack of vitamin D
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  Which is critical for human health
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:56.960]  And we're going to have
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  Yeah, it combats depression among other things
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:00.960]  Yeah, I mean, it combats depression among other things
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:03.960]  It's a vital vitamin that you need
[1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:05.960]  And most people don't even know that
[1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:07.960]  They don't understand that that's why a lot of people are depressed
[1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:08.960]  When they live in dark regions
[1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:10.960]  Because they don't get enough sunlight
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:12.960]  That's correct, and that's why I believe that
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:13.960]  Ricketts is on the rise
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:16.960]  Because as more and more of these man-made clouds
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:19.960]  Prevent direct sunlight from hitting the earth
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:22.960]  Not only does it lower crop production
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:24.960]  From a lack of photosynthesis
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  But it's beginning to show up
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:28.960]  In more and more recent studies
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:31.960]  From Kaiser and UC Berkeley
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:34.960]  Really alarmed about the increase in Ricketts
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:36.960]  In children in the United States
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:38.960]  And other related diseases
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.960]  So why don't you tell people
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:42.960]  Where they can find all this information
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.960]  What's your website and what can people do
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.960]  Because a lot of people still today tell me
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:48.960]  Oh, you're crazy, they're not really putting clouds up
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:50.960]  Into the sky, I can tape it
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  And I can tape it for like two hours
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:54.960]  And show how it's a straight line
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:56.960]  How they do cross-hatch patterns
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:58.960]  And how it basically becomes clouds
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:00.960]  Over the next hour, hour and a half
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:02.960]  And you see the mist, you can tell it's man-made
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:04.960]  And I'm still crazy, so why don't you tell people
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:06.960]  Where they can get this information
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.960]  And how they can spread it to others
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:13.960]  Okay, my website is CaliforniaSkyWatch.com
[1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:16.960]  And you can email me
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:18.960]  For more documentation if you like
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.960]  At info at CaliforniaSkyWatch.com
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:24.960]  That's all spelled out
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:26.960]  And you can go to the NASA website
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:29.960]  You can go to the NOAA website
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:32.960]  You can go to the US Air Force website
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:34.960]  And they talk about these programs
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.960]  I mean, a lot of them
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:38.960]  Some of them are classified
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.960]  But the majority are not
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:42.960]  And on my website
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:45.960]  You can find the listing for the last five years
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:47.960]  Of all the weather modification programs
[1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:49.960]  That are ongoing in California
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:51.960]  And across the western states
[1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:55.960]  Homeland security started modifying hurricanes
[1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:57.960]  Actually, this month
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:13:59.960]  The first of this month, they got the money
[1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:00.960]  Oh, lovely
[1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:01.960]  And they're in the business now
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:03.960]  Modifying hurricanes
[1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:06.960]  And that article is online as well
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:09.960]  So what happens is that
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:11.960]  If you start to look for it
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:12.960]  You will find it
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:15.960]  And people don't want their weather modified
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:17.960]  And their crop disrupted
[1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:19.960]  From weather modification programs
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:20.960]  They need to speak up
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:23.960]  Even in Southern California
[1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:25.960]  There's going to be a new one
[1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:27.960]  The City Council of Los Angeles
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:30.960]  Voted to put in a new weather modification program
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:32.960]  In the San Bernardino Mountains
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  And when I raised the question about
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:37.960]  How this would impact surrounding states
[1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:40.960]  And also the agricultural crop production
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.960]  In that area
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:44.960]  And in surrounding areas
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:46.960]  Dead silence
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.960]  Because they don't want to talk about it
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.960]  But KTVU
[1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:54.960]  John Fowler had a program
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:56.960]  That aired on July 28th
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  That was talking about
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:00.960]  All the weather modification programs
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:02.960]  In California
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:05.960]  And that private companies, private individuals
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:07.960]  Anyone can modify the weather
[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:09.960]  In your state or your county
[1:15:09.960 --> 1:15:11.960]  Without your consent
[1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:13.960]  Without any prior notification
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:15.960]  The National Weather Service
[1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:17.960]  Never tells you that your weather
[1:15:17.960 --> 1:15:19.960]  Is being modified by these programs
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:21.960]  And the listings are available
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:23.960]  Of over 60 of them
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:25.960]  That are ongoing every year
[1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:27.960]  And each state, each of the western states
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:29.960]  Is increasing the number
[1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:31.960]  That they do each year
[1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:33.960]  So the programs are there
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:35.960]  I'll be happy to send you the NOAA documents
[1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:37.960]  But they're up on the website
[1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:39.960]  And look at them
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:41.960]  But if we
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:43.960]  Start to look at weather modification
[1:15:43.960 --> 1:15:45.960]  And know that there's no government
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:47.960]  Oversight
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:49.960]  Private companies, private individuals
[1:15:49.960 --> 1:15:51.960]  Can modify your weather
[1:15:51.960 --> 1:15:53.960]  If they pay a company, a weather modification company
[1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:55.960]  To modify your weather
[1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:57.960]  They can just go do it
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:15:59.960]  And if it disrupts your agriculture
[1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:01.960]  Or puts you in a drought
[1:16:01.960 --> 1:16:03.960]  Well, so what?
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:05.960]  Because no one answers
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:07.960]  U.S. Congress
[1:16:07.960 --> 1:16:09.960]  Bills that say that anyone has to
[1:16:09.960 --> 1:16:11.960]  Get permission or notify anyone
[1:16:11.960 --> 1:16:13.960]  About these programs
[1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:15.960]  There are one regulation
[1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:17.960]  Says that you have to tell NOAA
[1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:19.960]  But I don't believe that
[1:16:19.960 --> 1:16:21.960]  The states and everyone that's
[1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:23.960]  And private individuals that are doing these programs
[1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:25.960]  Are notifying NOAA because there's a lot
[1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:27.960]  Missing from their records
[1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:29.960]  So this is what's going on
[1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:31.960]  And it's no secret
[1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:33.960]  You can look at the
[1:16:33.960 --> 1:16:35.960]  John Fowler program on KTVU
[1:16:35.960 --> 1:16:37.960]  By going in
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:39.960]  And clicking on KTVU.com
[1:16:39.960 --> 1:16:41.960]  And
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:43.960]  And then go just
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:45.960]  Put in John Fowler weather modification
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:47.960]  And the program will come right up
[1:16:47.960 --> 1:16:49.960]  Do you think that we're going to see a lot more
[1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:51.960]  Of these weather modification programs
[1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:53.960]  In the future? And do you think that they'll
[1:16:53.960 --> 1:16:55.960]  Eventually be revealed to the public?
[1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:57.960]  Or do you think that we're just in such a stupor
[1:16:57.960 --> 1:16:59.960]  They're probably going to be able to get away with doing whatever they like
[1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.960]  Like you said, you know, a private corporation
[1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:03.960]  Modifying the weather wherever
[1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:05.960]  Because there's no law against it
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:07.960]  Do you think that we're just going to see that over the next 15 to 20 years?
[1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:09.960]  Just complete denial
[1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.960]  Or do you think it's just going to be revealed?
[1:17:11.960 --> 1:17:13.960]  Yeah, we're doing it, no big deal
[1:17:13.960 --> 1:17:15.960]  Well, when they start
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:17.960]  We know that they're doing it now
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:19.960]  And so the problem is that
[1:17:19.960 --> 1:17:21.960]  Agriculture, water supplies
[1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:23.960]  Watershed, everything is suffering
[1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:25.960]  The impact of these programs
[1:17:25.960 --> 1:17:27.960]  And so we do know about it already
[1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:29.960]  And if we don't say no
[1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:33.960]  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson's bill
[1:17:33.960 --> 1:17:35.960]  U.S. Senate Bill 1807
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:38.960]  Or U.S. House Bill 3445
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:40.960]  Will pass this year
[1:17:40.960 --> 1:17:42.960]  And then they're really going to add
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:45.960]  Military weather modifications
[1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:47.960]  There will be no oversight in this bill
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.960]  You can read the bill, it's real simple to read
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:54.960]  And you can go to GovTrack.us
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:56.960]  And just put in U.S. Senate
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:59.960]  Number 1807, it will come right up
[1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:03.960]  And then there's U.S. Senate Bill 3036
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:05.960]  Which is Senator Barbara Boxer's
[1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:07.960]  Climate Security Act
[1:18:07.960 --> 1:18:09.960]  But it's not a climate security act
[1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:12.960]  It's got weather modification in that bill
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:14.960]  And weather mitigation in that bill
[1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:17.960]  And no public oversight
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:19.960]  No congressional oversight
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.960]  And anyone that wants to start experimenting
[1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:23.960]  Can go right ahead
[1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:26.960]  So Senator Lieberman's bill
[1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.960]  U.S. Senate Bill 2191
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:31.960]  They only need five votes to pass them
[1:18:31.960 --> 1:18:35.960]  And that legislation will be damaging to us
[1:18:35.960 --> 1:18:38.960]  Because it's even going to gut the Clean Water Act
[1:18:38.960 --> 1:18:40.960]  Oh my God
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:41.960]  And the EPA
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:43.960]  And so those bills
[1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:45.960]  So you can call
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.960]  You can look them up on GovTrack.us
[1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:49.960]  You can even type in weather modification
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:51.960]  And come up with about a hundred bills
[1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:53.960]  That all have weather modification
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:56.960]  Or mitigation within the text of the bill
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:58.960]  So there's a lot of interest
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:01.960]  But there's no interest in public oversight
[1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:05.960]  There's no interest in protecting
[1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:07.960]  Our agricultural crop production
[1:19:07.960 --> 1:19:09.960]  And you see if someone, some private company
[1:19:09.960 --> 1:19:12.960]  Wants to put water in place X
[1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:14.960]  Over your county
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:17.960]  That's great because you might wind up with flooding
[1:19:17.960 --> 1:19:19.960]  Instead of your normal rainfall
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:22.960]  And or some other place
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:24.960]  That's nearby will wind up in drought
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:26.960]  So who's going to own your weather
[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:28.960]  And who's going to own your water
[1:19:28.960 --> 1:19:30.960]  Yeah, it feels like they could cut out their competition
[1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:31.960]  If they'd like, you know
[1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:32.960]  They could just say, you know what
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:33.960]  These guys have farms
[1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:34.960]  Let's flood their crops
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:36.960]  I don't want to have to compete with these guys
[1:19:36.960 --> 1:19:38.960]  That's very, very scary
[1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:39.960]  And we're going to be taking calls
[1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:42.960]  For Rosalind Peterson in the next segment
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:44.960]  She's a real expert on weather modification folks
[1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:46.960]  You can go to infowars.com
[1:19:46.960 --> 1:19:47.960]  Prismplanet.com
[1:19:47.960 --> 1:19:49.960]  Link to her website, we'll be back after this
[1:20:00.960 --> 1:20:02.960]  It is a big idea
[1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:04.960]  A new world order
[1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:06.960]  In the near future
[1:20:06.960 --> 1:20:09.960]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:12.960]  It's known as the Bilderberg
[1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:15.960]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:20:15.960 --> 1:20:18.960]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:21.960]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:24.960]  Their great dream of exterminating 80%
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:26.960]  Of humanity is at hand
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:30.960]  For the first time in history
[1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.960]  The elite's plan for world government
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:34.960]  Is blown wide open
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.960]  You will learn the secret that drives
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.960]  The entire new world order agenda
[1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:40.960]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:41.960]  For the world government
[1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:42.960]  Most people have no idea
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:43.960]  They're not after money
[1:20:43.960 --> 1:20:44.960]  They have all the money they need
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:45.960]  They're after power
[1:20:45.960 --> 1:20:46.960]  Yes, they're after music

[1:20:57.960 --> 1:20:59.960]  You have been warned
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:01.960]  As many people know
[1:21:01.960 --> 1:21:03.960]  Ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:05.960]  The US dollar has been evaluating
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:07.960]  What people don't know, however
[1:21:07.960 --> 1:21:09.960]  Is how this directly affects your personal finances
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:11.960]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:12.960]  From losing value?
[1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.960]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:16.960]  They have both maintained their purchasing power
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:17.960]  For 6,000 years
[1:21:17.960 --> 1:21:20.960]  If you had had $100,000 in cash
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:22.960]  And $100,000 in gold and silver
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:24.960]  Back in 1913
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:26.960]  And kept them both until now
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.960]  Your cash would actually have the buying power
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:30.960]  Of only $4,800
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:31.960]  But your gold and silver
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:33.960]  Would have the buying power of $3 million
[1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:35.960]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple

[1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:58.960]  Extension 169
[1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:01.960]  It is now time to reign in evil
[1:22:01.960 --> 1:22:03.960]  And bring them to justice
[1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:05.960]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:08.960]  It is time to destroy the destroyers
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:11.960]  The number of the mounted troops was $200 million
[1:22:11.960 --> 1:22:14.960]  The vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:15.960]  Though the people of the U.S.
[1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:17.960]  Where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:20.960]  Have primary responsibility for reigning the men
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:21.960]  And bringing them to justice
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:23.960]  All nations will participate
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:25.960]  Since they reside the world over
[1:22:25.960 --> 1:22:26.960]  They are called Illuminati
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:27.960]  Elite
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:29.960]  Proponents of the New World Order
[1:22:29.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  They oppose everything that is God and truth
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:35.960]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago
[1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:38.960]  Everything they have built over the centuries
[1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:39.960]  The wealth they have accumulated
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:40.960]  The power they have established
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.960]  The poisoning of the masses
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:44.960]  The destruction of the earth and mankind
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.960]  We will undo through the authority
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:48.960]  That has now been delegated to us

[1:24:31.960 --> 1:24:34.960]  And as promised, I'm going to take your calls on topic
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:37.960]  For Rosalind Peterson, an expert on weather modifications
[1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:39.960]  She's really just done a bang-up job
[1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:41.960]  Putting all this information together
[1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:44.960]  She was featured on local NBC news
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:46.960]  When it came to comtrails, chemtrails
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:47.960]  Whatever you like to call them
[1:24:47.960 --> 1:24:50.960]  In one of the only mainstream news pieces about it
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:52.960]  Where they again said that this was happening
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.960]  To fight and combat global warming
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:57.960]  Alright, let's jump to Kevin in Canada
[1:24:57.960 --> 1:24:59.960]  Kevin, what's on your mind?
[1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:02.960]  I just want to talk about the whole chemtrail thing
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.960]  It's been out for a while, but there's a lot of people
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  Like I go into different chat rooms
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:07.960]  To try and discuss it myself
[1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:10.960]  I mean, governments come up with all kinds of admitted documents
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:11.960]  That they've been doing this
[1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:13.960]  But I'm not sure about the weather control thing
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:16.960]  Right now, the number 4 or 5 killer, something like that
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:19.960]  Is death by epic respiratory disease
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:21.960]  Caused by unknown illness
[1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:23.960]  And they basically prove that most of these chemtrails
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  Are still with barium, which causes this problem
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:29.960]  I think it's chromium, barium, and other heavy aluminum
[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:31.960]  Isn't it, Rosalind?
[1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:35.960]  I can't prove what the jets are releasing
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:37.960]  I don't have any direct evidence
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:40.960]  I do know that our water supplies are
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:44.960]  Spiking an aluminum, barium, manganese, magnesium
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:48.960]  And some other heavy metals
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:51.960]  And I'm very much questioning now
[1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:55.960]  Throughout California why we're having these spikes
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:58.960]  And I do know that some atmospheric heating
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:00.960]  And testing programs are ongoing
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:06.960]  Which use barium and lithium and strontium-90
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:08.960]  In these tests
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  And I'm concerned about the canisters
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  That they shoot up loaded with those chemicals
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  Into the atmosphere
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  And then when our government on rockets
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:20.960]  On the space shuttle puts them up and superheats them
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:23.960]  We do know that there's a chemical reaction
[1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:29.960]  When barium, strontium, lithium, manganese, magnesium
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:31.960]  And those chemicals are put together
[1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:35.960]  We do know that they create these
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:40.960]  In other words, these chemical research vehicles
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:43.960]  For us to figure out what's going on in the ionosphere
[1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:45.960]  But these chemicals do come back down
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:49.960]  And so from Alaska, across the United States
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:51.960]  We're getting a lot of these chemicals
[1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:54.960]  In our drinking water supplies
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:58.960]  Spiking way over state and federal standards
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:01.960]  Are you aware of the planes that had to change direction
[1:27:01.960 --> 1:27:03.960]  That were taking the Alaskan route
[1:27:03.960 --> 1:27:05.960]  Because too many of their stewardesses
[1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:07.960]  Were coming down with this illness
[1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:09.960]  No, I'm not
[1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:10.960]  Maybe you should email that too
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:12.960]  Or what's the website again, Rosalind?
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:15.960]  It's californiaskywatch.com
[1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:18.960]  And if you have any evidence, please send it to me
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.960]  I'd love to have it
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:22.960]  Alright Kevin, thanks for the call
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:24.960]  Man, we've got to jump to the next caller
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:27.960]  Wow, that's pretty crazy if those people are becoming ill
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:29.960]  But it would make sense
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:33.960]  If we have these spikes and they are putting something into the air
[1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:36.960]  In that little NBC report, don't they?
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.960]  It was you that was testing the water, right?
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:41.960]  And the guy said that all of the
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:43.960]  Compounds that would make for weather modification
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:45.960]  Were found there, correct?
[1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:48.960]  Yes, and what we're looking at
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.960]  Is not my own personal test
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  Anyone can get a CD
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:55.960]  From the California State Department of Health
[1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.960]  Going back into the 1970s
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:28:00.960]  With every single water test
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:03.960]  That was taken in the state of California
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:05.960]  Under EPA laws
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:08.960]  And those tests are taken in
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:11.960]  With every single drinking water source in California
[1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:15.960]  Whether it's a vineyard, a winery, a water district
[1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:17.960]  That does it well, it doesn't matter
[1:28:17.960 --> 1:28:20.960]  Anything that's used for a public drinking water source
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:23.960]  Is tested and tested several times a year
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:26.960]  So when I went back and I researched the data
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:29.960]  That was sent to me by the state of California
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:31.960]  Drinking Water Division
[1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:34.960]  That's when I began to find these unusual spikes
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.960]  In our drinking water
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:38.960]  To try to correlate it with what we were
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:40.960]  What I could find that was known
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:43.960]  About what was going on with atmospheric testing
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:46.960]  And I think there is a correlation there
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:49.960]  And other states are seeing the same types of spikes
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:51.960]  So it's in their drinking water supply
[1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:54.960]  So it's not just a California issue
[1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:56.960]  Alright, let's jump to Dave in California
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  Dave, what's on your mind?
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:00.960]  Hi guys, and congratulations on your new films, Jay
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:02.960]  Oh, thank you
[1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:04.960]  Rosalind, I spoke to you last time
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:07.960]  That you were on the air, and I mentioned that
[1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:10.960]  Up here in Humboldt County
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:12.960]  And all up into Oregon as well
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:14.960]  We're seeing fewer and fewer insects
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:17.960]  And wildlife, and especially birds
[1:29:17.960 --> 1:29:19.960]  At this point now, in the morning
[1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:21.960]  I don't even hear a bird, it used to be
[1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:23.960]  People here, one or two
[1:29:23.960 --> 1:29:25.960]  I had mentioned that last time
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:27.960]  And I'd also, since then, spoken to Alan Watt
[1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:29.960]  On the subject that he said that he noticed
[1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:32.960]  Ontario, Canada, the forests are much more silent
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:34.960]  Alright, hold on Dave
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:35.960]  We're going to hold you over
[1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:37.960]  And we're going to get Rosalind's opinion on the other side
[1:29:37.960 --> 1:29:38.960]  Remember the websites are
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:40.960]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com
[1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:52.960]  We're on the march
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:54.960]  The Empire's on the run
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:57.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:29:57.960 --> 1:29:59.960]  A day unlike any other
[1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:01.960]  In the long course of American history
[1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:04.960]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:06.960]  The enemies struck America on September 11
[1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:08.960]  But who is the enemy?
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:09.960]  Bin Laden
[1:30:09.960 --> 1:30:10.960]  This is his MO
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:12.960]  We have to look to the Middle East
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:14.960]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:18.960]  To take a close look at the terrorist
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:20.960]  Ties to Intelligence Networks
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:21.960]  Inside the United States
[1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:23.960]  Some US investigators believe that
[1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:24.960]  There are Israelis again
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:27.960]  Very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[1:30:27.960 --> 1:30:29.960]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:31.960]  Have been detained
[1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:33.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:35.960]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:30:35.960 --> 1:30:37.960]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:38.960]  The Israeli Intelligence Network
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:39.960]  Warnings and war games
[1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:40.960]  The shadow government
[1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:41.960]  And much, much more

[1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:03.960]  Where everything goes right?
[1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:05.960]  First, I get the best parking space at work
[1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:09.960]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:12.960]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney
[1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:13.960]  Finalized a contract in London

[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:03.960]  More than 700 chemicals have been found
[1:32:03.960 --> 1:32:04.960]  In our drinking water
[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:06.960]  And did you know that you have greater exposure
[1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:07.960]  To these chemicals
[1:32:07.960 --> 1:32:08.960]  While taking hot showers
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:09.960]  Than when drinking the water?
[1:32:09.960 --> 1:32:11.960]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled
[1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:12.960]  When they evaporate
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:14.960]  And others are absorbed into the skin
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:16.960]  The KDF dual media shower filter
[1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:18.960]  Works with both hot and cold water
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:21.960]  And is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury
[1:32:21.960 --> 1:32:24.960]  And iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold
[1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:26.960]  Algae and fungus
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:28.960]  The KDF dual media shower filter
[1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.960]  Typically lasts 10,000 gallons
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:32.960]  Or one year whichever comes first
[1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:34.960]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:36.960]  Use this media to reduce chlorine, iron
[1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:38.960]  Heavy metals and bacteria
[1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:39.960]  What about you?

[1:33:23.960 --> 1:33:28.960]  I've got so much more to think about
[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:31.960]  Deadlines and commitments
[1:33:31.960 --> 1:33:37.960]  What to leave in, what to leave out
[1:33:37.960 --> 1:33:40.960]  Against the wind
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:43.960]  We were running against the wind
[1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:45.960]  And we'll continue to run against the wind
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:47.960]  In this info war
[1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:48.960]  Against the disinformation
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:49.960]  Against the misinformation
[1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:51.960]  Against the provocateurs
[1:33:51.960 --> 1:33:53.960]  So people sent me links to just these
[1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:55.960]  Ravish attacks on Alex
[1:33:55.960 --> 1:33:57.960]  About his incident with Michelle Malkin
[1:33:57.960 --> 1:33:58.960]  At the DNC
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:00.960]  We played you the clip of Malkin
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.960]  Talking about it on the news
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:04.960]  And we'll get back to that later on
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:06.960]  In the show we're going to have Bob Chapman on
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:07.960]  In the next hour
[1:34:07.960 --> 1:34:08.960]  And then we're going to be taking your calls
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.960]  On any issue
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:12.960]  Open phones for the last 90 minutes
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:13.960]  Or so of the program
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:15.960]  But right now we're talking to Rosalind Peterson
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:17.960]  And we had David California asking
[1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:19.960]  If she thought there was a correlation
[1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:21.960]  Between this weather modification
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:23.960]  And the lack of wildlife in the areas
[1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  Yes, we're seeing
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:29.960]  Bird declines around the world
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:31.960]  We're seeing it
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:33.960]  Especially pollinators
[1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:35.960]  Many birds are pollinators
[1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:37.960]  We're seeing declines in them
[1:34:37.960 --> 1:34:40.960]  We're not finding as many birds as we did
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:42.960]  In many areas
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:45.960]  In the last few years
[1:34:45.960 --> 1:34:47.960]  In Lake County
[1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:49.960]  15,000 ducks just dropped out of the sky
[1:34:49.960 --> 1:34:52.960]  For no reason in one day
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:55.960]  And they quickly buried them
[1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:57.960]  Pulled them out of the clear lake
[1:34:57.960 --> 1:34:58.960]  And buried them
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:00.960]  Because they didn't know what else to do with them
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:01.960]  And then said that all these birds
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:04.960]  Dropped out of the sky in one day alive
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:06.960]  And that were killed by some virus
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:07.960]  Which is absolutely impossible
[1:35:07.960 --> 1:35:09.960]  Because viruses don't kill
[1:35:09.960 --> 1:35:11.960]  All at the same time with live birds
[1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:13.960]  Just dropping out of the air
[1:35:13.960 --> 1:35:16.960]  And this incident has occurred several times
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:19.960]  So we know that there's a decline
[1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:20.960]  And bee decline
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:22.960]  If you go to my website
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:24.960]  You'll find a lot of articles from bee decline
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:26.960]  Across the United States
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.960]  And if we don't have our bees
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:31.960]  We aren't going to have food supply
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:33.960]  Except for four or five crops
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:35.960]  That don't need bees for pollination
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:38.960]  So it's really critical
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:40.960]  That we right now
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:42.960]  Determine why we're having bird deaths
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:44.960]  And bee declines
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:47.960]  Even in England, they just came out
[1:35:47.960 --> 1:35:49.960]  With an article just this month
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:51.960]  That one-third of the bees died
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:53.960]  Over the last winter
[1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:55.960]  And half the bees are missing
[1:35:55.960 --> 1:35:57.960]  In some areas in California
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:35:59.960]  In the last year
[1:35:59.960 --> 1:36:01.960]  So beekeepers are going out of business
[1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:03.960]  And that means that your food crops
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:06.960]  Are not going to get the pollination they need
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:08.960]  Because of declines and bumblebees
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:10.960]  And other pollinators
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:12.960]  Any other questions, Dave?
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:14.960]  One more comment real fast
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:16.960]  I had also spoken to Alan Watt
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:18.960]  And Dr. Nick Begich about the same thing
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:21.960]  Nick Begich is up in Alaska
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:23.960]  And Alan Watt's in Ontario
[1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:25.960]  And they both mentioned that they've
[1:36:25.960 --> 1:36:27.960]  Seen a big decline in
[1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:29.960]  Particularly songbirds
[1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:31.960]  But also insect populations
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:33.960]  To some extent here
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:35.960]  The insect population is almost down to zero
[1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:37.960]  And it's continuing to stay that way
[1:36:37.960 --> 1:36:39.960]  I've continued to leave my doors
[1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:41.960]  And windows wide open
[1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:43.960]  And rarely see a fly
[1:36:43.960 --> 1:36:45.960]  As a matter of fact, I saw the first
[1:36:45.960 --> 1:36:47.960]  Honest to God, the first blue-bottle
[1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:49.960]  Fly I'd seen in three years
[1:36:49.960 --> 1:36:51.960]  A couple days ago
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:53.960]  And I just looked at it in amazement
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:55.960]  That's how crazy it's getting up here
[1:36:55.960 --> 1:36:57.960]  Aside from the weather modification
[1:36:57.960 --> 1:36:59.960]  Aspect of it, there seems to be
[1:36:59.960 --> 1:37:01.960]  Some sort of a wide-ranging
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:03.960]  Poisonous effect
[1:37:03.960 --> 1:37:05.960]  That most people aren't noticing
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:07.960]  And thank you for watching that
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:09.960]  It seems like it's quite toxic
[1:37:09.960 --> 1:37:11.960]  It doesn't seem like it's positive
[1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:13.960]  Or it's good for us
[1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:15.960]  Now, we have a caller who disagrees
[1:37:15.960 --> 1:37:17.960]  You disagree on this show
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:19.960]  You go to the front of the line
[1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:21.960]  That's how we do things on the Alex Jones show
[1:37:21.960 --> 1:37:23.960]  Larry and Australia, go right ahead
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:25.960]  Good morning from Australia
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:27.960]  I don't know what your time is over there
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:29.960]  But it's AM here
[1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:31.960]  That's where I am
[1:37:31.960 --> 1:37:33.960]  The reason I disagree
[1:37:33.960 --> 1:37:35.960]  Is I believe
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:37.960]  And I'll be listening
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:39.960]  Let me say something first off
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:41.960]  Alex, Jason, you've had test of jobs
[1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:43.960]  I've been listening to Alex
[1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:45.960]  Now for about the last two years
[1:37:45.960 --> 1:37:47.960]  And I listen every day
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:49.960]  I do believe that the
[1:37:49.960 --> 1:37:51.960]  Keen trials are
[1:37:51.960 --> 1:37:53.960]  It's all about eugenics
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:55.960]  We all know that
[1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:57.960]  New World Order want 80% reduction
[1:37:57.960 --> 1:37:59.960]  At least
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:01.960]  I believe that
[1:38:01.960 --> 1:38:03.960]  And then I believe that these
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:05.960]  Keen trials are all about eugenics
[1:38:05.960 --> 1:38:07.960]  We're reducing the population
[1:38:07.960 --> 1:38:09.960]  By at least 80%
[1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:11.960]  Your point is
[1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:13.960]  That the weather
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:15.960]  Modification that we're seeing
[1:38:15.960 --> 1:38:17.960]  Is really about a eugenics program
[1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:19.960]  For depopulation
[1:38:19.960 --> 1:38:21.960]  Exactly
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:23.960]  I believe they're experimenting into
[1:38:23.960 --> 1:38:25.960]  I don't disagree with your entirely
[1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:27.960]  But I do believe that
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:29.960]  The number one priority here is eugenics
[1:38:29.960 --> 1:38:31.960]  The New World Order
[1:38:31.960 --> 1:38:33.960]  That's what they want to do
[1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:35.960]  They want to eliminate
[1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:37.960]  At least 80% of us
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:39.960]  Let's get her take on it
[1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:41.960]  I appreciate the call
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:43.960]  And obviously she just said
[1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:45.960]  What was it?
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:47.960]  1500 ducks just dropped out of the sky
[1:38:47.960 --> 1:38:49.960]  Dead? There seems to be poison
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:51.960]  There was in the thousands
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:53.960]  Is this a possibility?
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:55.960]  Could this be a eugenics program?
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:57.960]  Well
[1:38:57.960 --> 1:38:59.960]  It could be
[1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.960]  And we don't know
[1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:03.960]  What I'm saying is
[1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:05.960]  Why don't we make all of this public
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:07.960]  And let the public decide on
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:09.960]  Whether they want these weather
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:11.960]  Modification programs or not
[1:39:11.960 --> 1:39:13.960]  Whether they want these atmospheric programs
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:15.960]  I think that this should be up for public debate
[1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:17.960]  And discussion
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:19.960]  And the public should be informed
[1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:21.960]  And then we can make the decision
[1:39:21.960 --> 1:39:23.960]  I don't think that
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:25.960]  Private individuals and government
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:27.960]  Should make this kind of decision
[1:39:27.960 --> 1:39:29.960]  I think we should
[1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:31.960]  And I think if there wasn't something wrong with it
[1:39:31.960 --> 1:39:33.960]  It would be openly discussed
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:35.960]  More than it is now
[1:39:35.960 --> 1:39:37.960]  I have to agree with you there
[1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:39.960]  I don't think we necessarily disagree
[1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:41.960]  I just think that you're very, very cautious
[1:39:41.960 --> 1:39:43.960]  In saying what you can and cannot prove
[1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:45.960]  Which is, I think a huge plus
[1:39:45.960 --> 1:39:47.960]  And you've been able to accumulate all this data
[1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:49.960]  So anybody with a brain
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:51.960]  Who looks at all this stuff
[1:39:51.960 --> 1:39:53.960]  Can see that it has a negative impact
[1:39:53.960 --> 1:39:55.960]  More than likely
[1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:57.960]  Is not what they're saying it is
[1:39:57.960 --> 1:39:59.960]  You've been fear-mongered with global warming
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:01.960]  Now for almost 30 years
[1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:03.960]  It was in my schools as a kid
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:05.960]  We're all going to die, it's going to get too hot
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:07.960]  The ocean's going to rise
[1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:09.960]  We're going to have mass flooding
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:11.960]  We're all bad, even today
[1:40:11.960 --> 1:40:13.960]  They're pushing for a carbon tax
[1:40:13.960 --> 1:40:15.960]  Saying that our carbon footprint is
[1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:17.960]  What's wrong and you're going to need to pay this tax
[1:40:17.960 --> 1:40:19.960]  Based on how many cars you own
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:21.960]  How big your house is, how much energy you use
[1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:23.960]  So it does seem like the environmental movement
[1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:25.960]  Has been completely and totally hijacked
[1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:27.960]  Alright, let's go to James
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:29.960]  In Ohio, James, what's on your mind?
[1:40:29.960 --> 1:40:31.960]  It's a pleasure to talk to you guys
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:33.960]  Thanks
[1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:35.960]  I was wondering, if I remember correctly
[1:40:35.960 --> 1:40:37.960]  Didn't they do something for the Olympics in China
[1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:39.960]  To make it rain or something?
[1:40:39.960 --> 1:40:41.960]  Do you know anything about that, Rosalind?
[1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:43.960]  Oh yes, there's a lot of articles
[1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:45.960]  If you go and google up China
[1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:47.960]  And weather modification
[1:40:47.960 --> 1:40:49.960]  There's a lot of articles
[1:40:49.960 --> 1:40:51.960]  And they've been modifying the weather
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:53.960]  For some time
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:55.960]  I've been kind of following it
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:40:57.960]  And so, yes
[1:40:57.960 --> 1:40:59.960]  I remember they were saying
[1:40:59.960 --> 1:41:01.960]  About the haze or whatever
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:03.960]  That was hanging over the city
[1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:05.960]  And they felt if it rained it would help out
[1:41:05.960 --> 1:41:07.960]  The
[1:41:07.960 --> 1:41:09.960]  Climate, not the climate
[1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:11.960]  But just the atmosphere right in the city right there
[1:41:11.960 --> 1:41:13.960]  Also, my question was
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:17.960]  What other countries are doing this kind of stuff?
[1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:19.960]  And is there any countries
[1:41:19.960 --> 1:41:21.960]  That are against it
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:23.960]  Trying to stop because
[1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:25.960]  Like I said, if China does something
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:27.960]  It's in the air and it's eventually going to get to us
[1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:29.960]  I feel
[1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:31.960]  There's
[1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.960]  United States
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:35.960]  Weather modification companies
[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:37.960]  Openly admit that they're modifying the weather
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:39.960]  In over 50 countries around the world
[1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:41.960]  That was on the Discovery Channel
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:43.960]  In 2007
[1:41:43.960 --> 1:41:45.960]  And the other issue
[1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:47.960]  Becomes that
[1:41:47.960 --> 1:41:49.960]  As we modify the weather more and more
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:51.960]  We perfect it
[1:41:51.960 --> 1:41:53.960]  Down to where it becomes the weapon of more
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:55.960]  Which is talked about
[1:41:55.960 --> 1:41:57.960]  The military talks about owning the weather
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:41:59.960]  In 2025
[1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:01.960]  And they talk about that it will be one of the most
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:03.960]  Powerful weapons of war
[1:42:03.960 --> 1:42:05.960]  However, they have to experiment
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:07.960]  On
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:09.960]  To make it
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:11.960]  In other words, to control the weather
[1:42:11.960 --> 1:42:13.960]  So I think the American population
[1:42:13.960 --> 1:42:15.960]  And other populations around the world
[1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:17.960]  Especially in NATO countries
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:19.960]  Have decided upon
[1:42:19.960 --> 1:42:21.960]  To do the weather modification program
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:23.960]  And openly, a lot of private companies
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:25.960]  Are doing these programs
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:27.960]  Does that answer your question?
[1:42:27.960 --> 1:42:29.960]  Thanks a lot. Like I said, it was a pleasure
[1:42:29.960 --> 1:42:31.960]  Alright, thank you.
[1:42:31.960 --> 1:42:33.960]  Let's jump to the next caller
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:35.960]  Let's go to Albert in Texas
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:37.960]  Albert, you're on the air
[1:42:37.960 --> 1:42:39.960]  Hey guys, thanks for taking my call
[1:42:39.960 --> 1:42:41.960]  The guest is really enlightening by the way
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:43.960]  There was something she just said
[1:42:43.960 --> 1:42:45.960]  Right just a while ago about the Discovery Channel
[1:42:45.960 --> 1:42:47.960]  Something else, I'm not sure how recent it was
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:49.960]  I have kind of a bad memory, but
[1:42:49.960 --> 1:42:51.960]  There's something about them making a man-made cloud
[1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:53.960]  With like a plane or something
[1:42:53.960 --> 1:42:55.960]  I think it was for an experiment
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:57.960]  I can't remember, but if she could talk about that
[1:42:57.960 --> 1:42:59.960]  Maybe, I don't know if she knew about it
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:01.960]  It's on the show, I don't know what show it was
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:03.960]  I think it was on Discovery
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:05.960]  And then the second thing I wanted to ask
[1:43:05.960 --> 1:43:07.960]  I guess is
[1:43:07.960 --> 1:43:09.960]  We are going to have the money masters back on
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:11.960]  Because I have some questions about Lincoln Greenback
[1:43:11.960 --> 1:43:13.960]  He had them on last month
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:15.960]  Before they get the money masters back on
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:17.960]  I know that last time you were on here, Rosalind
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:19.960]  That you talked about
[1:43:19.960 --> 1:43:21.960]  That Discovery Channel special, didn't you?
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:23.960]  Yes, I talked about the Discovery Channel
[1:43:23.960 --> 1:43:27.960]  They did a bait and switch tactics on that
[1:43:27.960 --> 1:43:29.960]  And made claims that some of us
[1:43:29.960 --> 1:43:33.960]  Who talk about these experimental programs
[1:43:33.960 --> 1:43:35.960]  That we were some sort of believers
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:37.960]  But other than that
[1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:39.960]  There was some interesting information on it
[1:43:39.960 --> 1:43:41.960]  Because they did talk about modifying the weather
[1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:43.960]  They talked about
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:45.960]  Persistent jet contrails
[1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:47.960]  NASA Patrick Minnis was on there
[1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:49.960]  And what he talked about
[1:43:49.960 --> 1:43:51.960]  Was these man-made persistent contrails
[1:43:51.960 --> 1:43:53.960]  That turn into man-made clouds
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:43:55.960]  That can persist for hours
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:43:57.960]  And change the climate
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:43:59.960]  Modify the weather
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:01.960]  And he talked about one contrail
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:03.960]  That, in other words
[1:44:03.960 --> 1:44:05.960]  That they were looking at and specific
[1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:07.960]  That lasted, that expanded
[1:44:07.960 --> 1:44:09.960]  And lasted for about 26 hours
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:11.960]  And they can cover
[1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:13.960]  4,000 square miles
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:15.960]  One contrail
[1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:17.960]  So when you put up a lot
[1:44:17.960 --> 1:44:19.960]  You realize that we're dimming the amount of sunlight
[1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:21.960]  And making man-made clouds
[1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:23.960]  All over the United States
[1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:25.960]  Also, I would recommend that any
[1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:27.960]  Listeners from Texas
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:29.960]  Look up the Texas Weather Modification Program
[1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:31.960]  And find out if you're in a drought area
[1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:33.960]  Produced by one of those
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:35.960]  Weather Modification Programs
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:37.960]  And they have a lot of them
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:39.960]  Or if you are in an area
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:41.960]  Which got too much rainfall
[1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:43.960]  Because one of those programs
[1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:45.960]  When arrived
[1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:47.960]  So check out
[1:44:47.960 --> 1:44:49.960]  Texas Weather Modification Programs
[1:44:49.960 --> 1:44:51.960]  You just Google it up and it comes right up
[1:44:51.960 --> 1:44:53.960]  Alright, thanks for the call, Albert
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:44:55.960]  And before we jump to some more callers
[1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:57.960]  I want to take this moment to
[1:44:57.960 --> 1:44:59.960]  Thank our sponsor, Okolo Blue
[1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:01.960]  It's this great
[1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:03.960]  Water system
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:05.960]  That we have here
[1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:07.960]  We got it in here I think about a month
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:09.960]  A month and a half ago
[1:45:09.960 --> 1:45:11.960]  We took them on as a sponsor a little bit after that
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:13.960]  But it's the best tasting water I've had
[1:45:13.960 --> 1:45:15.960]  And believe it or not, folks, you don't have to fill it
[1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:17.960]  It's a water purifier
[1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:19.960]  In other words, you're not going to get any fluoride
[1:45:19.960 --> 1:45:21.960]  Anything like that
[1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:23.960]  But it takes the humidity out of the air
[1:45:23.960 --> 1:45:25.960]  It pays for itself in one year
[1:45:25.960 --> 1:45:27.960]  I know that I buy bottled water continuously now
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:29.960]  I know I shouldn't, I know it's all poison
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:31.960]  But I don't have the time to just sit there
[1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:33.960]  And fill and filter
[1:45:33.960 --> 1:45:35.960]  And get one that's really reasonable
[1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:37.960]  At this workwater generator for your home
[1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:39.960]  It pays for itself within a year
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:41.960]  Again, you're not going to get the fluoride
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:43.960]  You're probably not going to get the barium, chromium
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:45.960]  And other goodies that they've been putting in the sky
[1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:47.960]  Either because it filters all that stuff out
[1:45:47.960 --> 1:45:49.960]  And it does seven and a half gallons
[1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:51.960]  In one day
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:53.960]  So you can go to okoloblue.com
[1:45:53.960 --> 1:45:55.960]  That's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E
[1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:57.960]  Or you can call the toll free number
[1:45:57.960 --> 1:45:59.960]  At 866-585-4044
[1:45:59.960 --> 1:46:01.960]  That's 866-585-4044
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:03.960]  And it is delicious
[1:46:03.960 --> 1:46:05.960]  And it's cold too, it's kind of cool
[1:46:05.960 --> 1:46:07.960]  Because it's not only cold
[1:46:07.960 --> 1:46:09.960]  But you can have it come out hot
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:11.960]  You just have these two separate buttons
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.960]  And you can have tea with it and all that other good stuff
[1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:15.960]  So okoloblue.com
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:17.960]  Alright, let's jump to another Texan caller
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:19.960]  Let's go to Adam in Texas
[1:46:19.960 --> 1:46:21.960]  Adam, what's on your mind?
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:23.960]  Hi, it's just good to hear this conversation
[1:46:23.960 --> 1:46:25.960]  Because I've been following this
[1:46:25.960 --> 1:46:27.960]  I spend my summers in Alaska
[1:46:27.960 --> 1:46:29.960]  And I usually drive, I've driven to Alaska
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:31.960]  And back in the spring and the fall
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:33.960]  10 times
[1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:35.960]  And I spent a lot of time in British Columbia
[1:46:35.960 --> 1:46:37.960]  In Alaska
[1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:39.960]  The denial that they have up there
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:41.960]  Towards the chemtrail issue
[1:46:41.960 --> 1:46:43.960]  I think that when they're in a beautiful place
[1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:45.960]  Like Alaska and you have so many things to do
[1:46:45.960 --> 1:46:47.960]  With your spare time
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:49.960]  That you don't bother
[1:46:49.960 --> 1:46:51.960]  Concerning yourself with a lot of subject matters
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:53.960]  That they're finally starting to have to come to grips
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:55.960]  With, I sat and talked to some people
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:46:57.960]  Up in Alaska and they all
[1:46:57.960 --> 1:46:59.960]  90% of them basically thought I was crazy
[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:01.960]  But the thing is
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:03.960]  I've been following this for over 10 years
[1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:05.960]  The very first one I ever saw with my own eyes
[1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:07.960]  I knew something was wrong and drove straight into it
[1:47:07.960 --> 1:47:09.960]  And I've been in the middle of it
[1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:11.960]  And I've got samples
[1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:13.960]  From, I read rinse.com one day
[1:47:13.960 --> 1:47:15.960]  Where they talked about these
[1:47:15.960 --> 1:47:17.960]  Polymer fibers with desiccated blood cells
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:19.960]  Attached to them
[1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:21.960]  And I couldn't believe that was true
[1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:23.960]  I'm playing golf December 15th
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:25.960]  2005 in Fort Worth
[1:47:25.960 --> 1:47:27.960]  And all of a sudden I see these spider webs
[1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:29.960]  Falling from the sky
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:31.960]  And you can't collect them with your hands
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:33.960]  Because the stuff is heat sensitive
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:35.960]  So you grab these twigs
[1:47:35.960 --> 1:47:37.960]  Where it was collecting on bushes
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:39.960]  And I collected this stuff, took it home
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:41.960]  Went and bought a microscope
[1:47:41.960 --> 1:47:43.960]  And it's exactly what was on rinse.com
[1:47:43.960 --> 1:47:45.960]  So I mean, you know this
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:47.960]  This should be at the front of the
[1:47:47.960 --> 1:47:49.960]  This should be at the top of the heap
[1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:51.960]  As far as what we're talking about here
[1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:53.960]  Concerning our government and everything else
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:55.960]  You know, the
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:47:57.960]  I think we're coming
[1:47:57.960 --> 1:47:59.960]  I think we're coming face to face
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:01.960]  With the brainwashing of the
[1:48:01.960 --> 1:48:03.960]  Denial people are in with this subject
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:05.960]  Well there's no doubt that we are brainwashed
[1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:07.960]  And there is an ultra denial
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:09.960]  I would say 95% of the population
[1:48:09.960 --> 1:48:11.960]  Still has no idea about any of this stuff
[1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:13.960]  What's your take on the polymers
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:15.960]  And I thank you for the call, Adam
[1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:17.960]  I don't
[1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:19.960]  I don't know because
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:21.960]  I have never had any to test
[1:48:21.960 --> 1:48:23.960]  And I know that the southern states
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:25.960]  From Florida, Louisiana
[1:48:25.960 --> 1:48:27.960]  Georgia, Texas
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:29.960]  All of those states
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:31.960]  Arkansas are all having problems
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:33.960]  And so
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:35.960]  And other areas in the United States
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:37.960]  As well
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:39.960]  And I haven't ever had any to test
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:41.960]  And I don't advocate anyone
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:43.960]  Sending me those because I don't want to
[1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:45.960]  If there's a problem
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:47.960]  I don't want to spread whatever's
[1:48:47.960 --> 1:48:49.960]  Going on around either
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:51.960]  So I can't tell you too much
[1:48:51.960 --> 1:48:53.960]  About it, I've heard about it
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:55.960]  But I don't know
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:48:57.960]  But I do want to say
[1:48:57.960 --> 1:48:59.960]  Is that everything has been
[1:48:59.960 --> 1:49:01.960]  Put under
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:03.960]  The chemtrail conspiracy wording
[1:49:03.960 --> 1:49:05.960]  And what happens
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:07.960]  Is I even talked this past week
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:09.960]  To a staff member for
[1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:11.960]  A U.S. congresswoman
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:13.960]  And what happened was
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:15.960]  Is that when I started to raise
[1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:17.960]  The issues about the water test
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:19.960]  And raised all the issues about the document
[1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:21.960]  He's the one that brought up
[1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:23.960]  The conspiracy theory
[1:49:23.960 --> 1:49:25.960]  And in other words
[1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:27.960]  It's almost dismissive
[1:49:27.960 --> 1:49:29.960]  The United States Air Force
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:31.960]  Declared Chemtrails a hoax
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:33.960]  NASA, NOAA, government agencies
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:35.960]  And what happens is our elected officials
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:37.960]  Don't want to touch that word
[1:49:37.960 --> 1:49:39.960]  Because they figure it's
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:41.960]  Like they don't want to be branded
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:43.960]  In believing or thinking about
[1:49:43.960 --> 1:49:45.960]  A conspiracy theory
[1:49:45.960 --> 1:49:47.960]  So I really refuse
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:49.960]  To use it, and what I've done
[1:49:49.960 --> 1:49:51.960]  Is I've gone in and I put the documents
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:53.960]  In front of them
[1:49:53.960 --> 1:49:55.960]  I put the reports in front of them
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:49:57.960]  And I hammer away
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:49:59.960]  That we're not talking about a conspiracy theory
[1:49:59.960 --> 1:50:01.960]  What we're talking about are real tests
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:03.960]  Real results, real studies
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:05.960]  By NASA, real weather modifications
[1:50:05.960 --> 1:50:07.960]  Listed by NOAA
[1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:09.960]  And you see, I drive home
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:11.960]  The issue that the treaty kind
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:13.960]  The bee decline
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:15.960]  Things are real
[1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:17.960]  The legislation on weather modification
[1:50:17.960 --> 1:50:19.960]  Programs are real
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:21.960]  So I hammer away at this
[1:50:21.960 --> 1:50:23.960]  And this is where I'm starting
[1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:25.960]  And people that are doing this too
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:27.960]  Are starting to make inroads on this subject
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:29.960]  And those that just talk about
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:31.960]  Chemtrails and loop everything into
[1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:33.960]  A belief system, it doesn't work well
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:35.960]  I agree, and I love your approach
[1:50:35.960 --> 1:50:37.960]  You are showing them the documents
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.960]  You're breaking it down, it's California Skywatch
[1:50:39.960 --> 1:50:41.960]  Dot com, final segment
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:43.960]  Alan Peterson, on the other side
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:45.960]  We're going to finish up with your phone calls
[1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:47.960]  We've got TJ Scott and others holding
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:49.960]  We'll get to them after this
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:51.960]  It's infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[1:50:51.960 --> 1:51:01.960]  Music
[1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:03.960]  Did you know that pH balance
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:05.960]  Is one of the most important factors
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:07.960]  In maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[1:51:07.960 --> 1:51:09.960]  Most experts agree that the water you drink
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:11.960]  Has a pH level of 9 or higher
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:13.960]  Plasma pH drops
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:15.960]  Combine a unique formula of the most alkaline
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:17.960]  Minerals and elements
[1:51:17.960 --> 1:51:19.960]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:21.960]  And effectiveness
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:23.960]  Using plasma pH drops
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:25.960]  Is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:27.960]  While helping you get rid of acid
[1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:29.960]  And regaining your health and energy
[1:51:29.960 --> 1:51:31.960]  With just 10 drops
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:33.960]  You can raise the pH level of the water you drink
[1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:35.960]  Up to the pH of 10
[1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:37.960]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself
[1:51:37.960 --> 1:51:39.960]  Of acidic waste
[1:51:39.960 --> 1:51:41.960]  And increases the oxygen content of your body
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:43.960]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer
[1:51:43.960 --> 1:51:45.960]  Cannot survive in an alkaline environment
[1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:47.960]  Order your bottle of

[1:51:57.960 --> 1:51:59.960]  Today
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:01.960]  May I have everybody's attention please
[1:52:01.960 --> 1:52:03.960]  I've come with a message
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:05.960]  Of information
[1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:07.960]  9-11 was an inside job
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:09.960]  Do you like being a puppet sir?
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:11.960]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:13.960]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:15.960]  Was engineered by you, David Rockefeller
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:17.960]  The fallout or commission, the CFR
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:19.960]  You need to sit down and shout out
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:21.960]  The day that we stop asking questions
[1:52:21.960 --> 1:52:23.960]  Is the day that we have allowed
[1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:25.960]  The seeds of despotism to grow
[1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:27.960]  At our own door
[1:52:27.960 --> 1:52:29.960]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11
[1:52:29.960 --> 1:52:31.960]  A global awakening has taken place
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:33.960]  An inside job
[1:52:33.960 --> 1:52:35.960]  An inside job
[1:52:35.960 --> 1:52:37.960]  How dare you
[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:41.960]  If you know that there's treason going on
[1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:43.960]  You can be held accountable for treason yourself
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:45.960]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:47.960]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:49.960]  In five years we will be here
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:53:05.960]  How much longer will you ignore the warning signs?
[1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:07.960]  How much longer will you turn away
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:09.960]  Like a blind man
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:11.960]  How much longer
[1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:13.960]  The choice of life or death
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:15.960]  Abundance or starvation is made today
[1:53:15.960 --> 1:53:17.960]  Do you have a long term food solution?

[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:29.960]  www.survivalistseeds.com
[1:54:29.960 --> 1:54:31.960]  All right folks we are back
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:33.960]  It is the Alex Jones show
[1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:35.960]  I'm Jason Bermas sitting in
[1:54:35.960 --> 1:54:37.960]  Why can't we get the CCR version of that one
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:39.960]  I'm a bigger fan of that
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:41.960]  All right we're going to take your phone calls with Rosalind Peterson
[1:54:41.960 --> 1:54:43.960]  This is the final segment
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:45.960]  California Skywatch.com is the website
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:47.960]  TJ in Minnesota what's on your mind
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:49.960]  Are you there TJ?
[1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:51.960]  Yeah are you there?
[1:54:51.960 --> 1:54:53.960]  Okay Rosalind I commend your feminine view
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:55.960]  On this spray plane problem
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:54:57.960]  We've had for about nine years
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:54:59.960]  Here in the upper Midwest
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:01.960]  I think your narrow approach
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:03.960]  Might be very well
[1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:05.960]  Constructive to the masses
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:07.960]  Wherein they won't believe
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:09.960]  All of the realities surrounding
[1:55:09.960 --> 1:55:11.960]  This diabolical operation
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:13.960]  They can't deny bad weather
[1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:15.960]  And so I commend you for that approach
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:17.960]  And it remains to be seen
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:19.960]  If we'll win this battle against these
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:21.960]  Flying bestardos
[1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:23.960]  But I want to tell you something
[1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:25.960]  There's a clear channel radio station
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:27.960]  In North Central Iowa
[1:55:27.960 --> 1:55:29.960]  And in the past three or four months
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:31.960]  Before they give a
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:33.960]  Weather forecast
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:35.960]  One of their own boys
[1:55:35.960 --> 1:55:37.960]  It's interjected into a weather forecast
[1:55:37.960 --> 1:55:39.960]  On radio amplitude
[1:55:39.960 --> 1:55:41.960]  Modulation
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:43.960]  AM clear channel
[1:55:43.960 --> 1:55:45.960]  And it says
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:47.960]  Weather modification
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:49.960]  And then it goes on to say
[1:55:49.960 --> 1:55:51.960]  What's in the store for you today
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:53.960]  And I called the radio station
[1:55:53.960 --> 1:55:55.960]  And made an inquiry
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:57.960]  And they acted like they hadn't even heard
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:55:59.960]  Their own programming
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:01.960]  Well I think they're trying to
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:03.960]  Acclimate people
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:05.960]  Absolutely
[1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:07.960]  I think the National Weather Service
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:09.960]  Has been talking about
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:11.960]  Well we have to save the planet
[1:56:11.960 --> 1:56:13.960]  The weather
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:15.960]  And I think if we stop modifying
[1:56:15.960 --> 1:56:17.960]  The weather
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:19.960]  And stop all these programs
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:21.960]  We wouldn't be having so many problems
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:23.960]  And so much unusual weather
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:25.960]  Alright let's jump to the next caller
[1:56:25.960 --> 1:56:27.960]  Let's go to Scott in Arizona
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:29.960]  Scott what's on your mind
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:31.960]  Hey how are you guys
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:33.960]  Good
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:35.960]  Okay well I've researched this
[1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:37.960]  The chemtrail thing for a long time
[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:39.960]  And I have the real answers
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:41.960]  To actual you know just like Rosalind's talking about
[1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:43.960]  But there's a program I haven't heard her mention
[1:56:43.960 --> 1:56:45.960]  It's called the Atmospheric
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:47.960]  Radiation Measurement Program
[1:56:47.960 --> 1:56:49.960]  That's the ARM program and it's part of the DOE
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:51.960]  Department of Energy
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:53.960]  And in that program it's directed with
[1:56:53.960 --> 1:56:55.960]  Universities and Pacific Northwest
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:56:57.960]  National Labs
[1:56:57.960 --> 1:56:59.960]  They have their own website
[1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:01.960]  In there they talk about how they put the stuff in the air
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:03.960]  It's called indirect
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:05.960]  And direct aerosol campaign
[1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:07.960]  You can Google all that stuff
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:09.960]  To Alex he checked it out and he flipped out over it
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:11.960]  And he said this guy
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:13.960]  He wanted me to write a story I just
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:15.960]  You know I'm not the kind of computer savvy
[1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:17.960]  As far as writing stories and stuff
[1:57:17.960 --> 1:57:19.960]  But I haven't done that yet
[1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:21.960]  Maybe you can email this stuff to Rosalind
[1:57:21.960 --> 1:57:23.960]  Let me get her take before the end of the segment
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:25.960]  On this stuff Rosalind
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:27.960]  Yes you can email me the information
[1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:29.960]  That would be great
[1:57:29.960 --> 1:57:31.960]  Anything else there Scott
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:33.960]  Yeah there is
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:35.960]  On that ARM program remember
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:37.960]  So it's called the ARM program
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:39.960]  All you have to do is type an ARM program
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:41.960]  For the DOE
[1:57:41.960 --> 1:57:43.960]  And your site will come right up
[1:57:43.960 --> 1:57:45.960]  You can do that
[1:57:45.960 --> 1:57:47.960]  And once you do that
[1:57:47.960 --> 1:57:49.960]  You can film around in there
[1:57:49.960 --> 1:57:51.960]  It's kind of a secret site
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:53.960]  So you can get some information
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:55.960]  Off of general information
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:57:57.960]  All you have to do is type in indirect
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:57:59.960]  Semi direct or direct
[1:57:59.960 --> 1:58:01.960]  You can type either one of those aerosol campaign
[1:58:01.960 --> 1:58:03.960]  And you will get
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:05.960]  What they're doing in the air
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:07.960]  And it's called scattering
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:09.960]  When they put the particles up in the air
[1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:11.960]  It's called scattering
[1:58:11.960 --> 1:58:13.960]  There is a whistleblower that formed this
[1:58:13.960 --> 1:58:15.960]  A long time ago
[1:58:15.960 --> 1:58:17.960]  I haven't checked them out to see how much credibility he has
[1:58:17.960 --> 1:58:19.960]  I got to let you go Scott
[1:58:19.960 --> 1:58:21.960]  But please send that information to Rosalind Peterson
[1:58:21.960 --> 1:58:23.960]  Rosalind thank you so much for joining us
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:25.960]  Oh and thank you for having me on the show
[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:27.960]  It's CaliforniaSkyWatch.com
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:29.960]  Really great guests
[1:58:29.960 --> 1:58:31.960]  We'll be back after this with Bob Chapman
[1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:41.960]  Music
[1:58:41.960 --> 1:58:44.960]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:48.960]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.960]  A day unlike any other
[1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:54.960]  In the long course of American history
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:56.960]  A terrorist act of war
[1:58:56.960 --> 1:58:58.960]  Against this country
[1:58:58.960 --> 1:59:00.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11
[1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:02.960]  But who is the enemy?
[1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:03.960]  bin Laden
[1:59:03.960 --> 1:59:04.960]  This is his MO
[1:59:04.960 --> 1:59:05.960]  We have to look to the Middle East
[1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:07.960]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:09.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:11.960]  To take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:14.960]  To intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:59:14.960 --> 1:59:16.960]  Some US investigators believe that there are
[1:59:16.960 --> 1:59:18.960]  Israelis again very much engaged
[1:59:18.960 --> 1:59:21.960]  In spying in and on the US
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:23.960]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:59:23.960 --> 1:59:25.960]  Have been detained
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:27.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:29.960]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:31.960]  The Israeli intelligence network
[1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:32.960]  Warnings in war games
[1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:33.960]  The shadow government
[1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:34.960]  And much, much more
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:35.960]  Fabled enemies
[1:59:35.960 --> 1:59:38.960]  Get the DVD at infowars.com
[1:59:38.960 --> 1:59:40.960]  Or see it in super high quality
[1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:41.960]  Along with hundreds of other titles
[1:59:41.960 --> 1:59:43.960]  At prisonplanet.tv
[1:59:43.960 --> 1:59:45.960]  Either you are with us
[1:59:45.960 --> 1:59:47.960]  Or you are with the terrorists
[1:59:47.960 --> 2:00:00.960]  Waging war on corruption
[2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:18.960]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:19.960]  You want answers?
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:20.960]  Well, so does he
[2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:24.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:27.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:28.960]  Alex Jones
[2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:30.960]  Sitting in today, tomorrow
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:33.960]  And remember there will be a best of the week
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:36.960]  With Alex Jones' adventures from the DNC
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:39.960]  Already making national news all over the place
[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:40.960]  I think it was inside edition
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:42.960]  Not extra that was coming over today
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:43.960]  But I'm not quite sure
[2:00:43.960 --> 2:00:45.960]  He was on Russia today
[2:00:45.960 --> 2:00:46.960]  We aired that clip
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:48.960]  He broke through on MSNBC
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:49.960]  For about 40 minutes
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:51.960]  Chanting 9-11 was an inside job
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:53.960]  And infowars.com
[2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:54.960]  Of course he had that altercation
[2:00:54.960 --> 2:00:55.960]  With Michelle Malkin
[2:00:55.960 --> 2:00:56.960]  And it's so funny
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:00:58.960]  I'm sitting here and I'm reading
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:00.960]  Some of these bloggers
[2:01:00.960 --> 2:01:03.960]  And Mashable.com is calling Alex a
[2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:05.960]  Not only did he call for a death
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:08.960]  But he's an ultra-left wing hardcore leftist
[2:01:08.960 --> 2:01:11.960]  And he was there to levitate the mint
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:12.960]  No, he wasn't
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:13.960]  He was walking through the crowd
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:15.960]  None of us are dumb enough
[2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:17.960]  To dress up like wizards
[2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:19.960]  And think we're going to levitate the mint
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:20.960]  No, he was trying to
[2:01:20.960 --> 2:01:22.960]  Get press attention to the monster
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:24.960]  That is Michelle Malkin
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:26.960]  Somebody who literally calls
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.960]  For internment camps for Americans
[2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:30.960]  Someone who literally lies about the soldiers
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:32.960]  Killing innocent animals and people
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:34.960]  Unfortunately, I mean
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:36.960]  Some of the people over there are lost folks
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:38.960]  They shoot to kill anything
[2:01:38.960 --> 2:01:40.960]  They enjoy it, it's sick
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:42.960]  And this little propagandist
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:43.960]  Gets confronted by Alex
[2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:45.960]  And then her little neocon bloggers
[2:01:45.960 --> 2:01:46.960]  Run over
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:48.960]  One of them has a ridiculous black panther
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:49.960]  Obama hat
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:51.960]  He really looks like he needs to be backhanded
[2:01:51.960 --> 2:01:53.960]  And you know, kill Michelle Malkin
[2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:54.960]  Kill Michelle
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:55.960]  Alex is saying kill Michelle Malkin
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:01:56.960]  No, he wasn't
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:58.960]  Basically, he was calling her out
[2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:00.960]  On her nonsense
[2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:02.960]  I want to take this opportunity
[2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:04.960]  To thank our great sponsor
[2:02:04.960 --> 2:02:06.960]  At eFoodsDirect.com
[2:02:06.960 --> 2:02:08.960]  That's eFoodsDirect.com
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:09.960]  And they are the best
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:12.960]  Storeable food people in the business
[2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:14.960]  I mean, you can literally get your grocery
[2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:15.960]  Bill for a year
[2:02:15.960 --> 2:02:17.960]  Cut in half and have peace of mind
[2:02:17.960 --> 2:02:18.960]  Just in case of a disaster
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:20.960]  Man, with the way Paul Craig Roberts
[2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:21.960]  Was talking today
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:23.960]  I guess you'd be lucky enough
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:24.960]  To use your storeable food
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:26.960]  If this Russia attack goes down
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:27.960]  Literally talking about
[2:02:27.960 --> 2:02:29.960]  What seemed like global Armageddon
[2:02:29.960 --> 2:02:30.960]  It was gross
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:31.960]  You can call eFoodsDirect
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:34.960]  At 1-800-409-5633
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:37.960]  That's 1-800-409-5633
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:39.960]  And in a country right now where
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:41.960]  You know, they ration rice and grain
[2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:42.960]  In some places
[2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:43.960]  You can only get so many bags
[2:02:43.960 --> 2:02:45.960]  It's pretty wild
[2:02:45.960 --> 2:02:47.960]  And these people will sell you
[2:02:47.960 --> 2:02:49.960]  What you need to survive
[2:02:49.960 --> 2:02:50.960]  In case of an emergency
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:52.960]  It's eFoodsDirect.com
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:53.960]  You can call them again
[2:02:53.960 --> 2:02:56.960]  At 1-800-409-5633
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:02:58.960]  And we're going to be joined now
[2:02:58.960 --> 2:02:59.960]  By Bob Chapman of the
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:01.960]  InternationalForecaster.com
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:03.960]  To get his take on the DNC
[2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:04.960]  And how things are going down there
[2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:06.960]  Bob, are you with us?
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:07.960]  I am with you
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:08.960]  How are you doing today, sir?
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:09.960]  I'm pretty good
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:12.960]  I guess that the Democrats
[2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:14.960]  Are fighting among themselves
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:16.960]  And I'm sure the Republicans
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:17.960]  Will do the same
[2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:19.960]  Wherever you've got power
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:20.960]  Going on
[2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:21.960]  There's always somebody
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:23.960]  Who wants to get a leg up
[2:03:23.960 --> 2:03:27.960]  And Hillary let everybody know
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:29.960]  She was mad at her husband
[2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:31.960]  For hurting her chances
[2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:32.960]  For the nomination
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:33.960]  Did she say that
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:34.960]  In the speech last night?
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:35.960]  I mean, I didn't touch her speech
[2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:38.960]  But some of their close associates
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:39.960]  Said that
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:41.960]  And I guess Bill was up
[2:03:41.960 --> 2:03:43.960]  And some way up on the gallery
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:45.960]  I didn't see it
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:48.960]  But you know, it's all a show
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:52.960]  As we know, the candidates will be
[2:03:52.960 --> 2:03:54.960]  What the alumnus behind the scenes
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:55.960]  Want them to be
[2:03:55.960 --> 2:03:57.960]  And who they will be
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:00.960]  And us sheeple will get to vote for them
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:04.960]  In fact, I cover that briefly
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:07.960]  In today's International Forecaster
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:10.960]  And so I think what we've got to aim at
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:13.960]  At Congress in this next election
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:16.960]  And with the exception of a few people
[2:04:16.960 --> 2:04:18.960]  And get rid of them all
[2:04:18.960 --> 2:04:19.960]  We don't need them
[2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:21.960]  Well, let's get some new people in there
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:23.960]  Some ladies and gentlemen
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:26.960]  Who want to really represent their constituents
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:29.960]  And not the banking sector
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:32.960]  Or Wall Street or corporate America
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:34.960]  Well, I want to talk about that
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:36.960]  Well, I want to talk about that on the other side
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:38.960]  I think a good test to see if we'll be able
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:40.960]  To actually do that is
[2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:42.960]  Whether we can elect Cindy Sheehan or not
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:44.960]  If we can get Sheehan in office over Pelosi
[2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:46.960]  I think there might be hope that others
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:48.960]  May take her lead and run for Congress
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:50.960]  Not on behalf of the special interests
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:52.960]  But on behalf of we the people
[2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:53.960]  We'll be back after this

[2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:20.960]  Sitting in for Alex
[2:08:20.960 --> 2:08:21.960]  Remember fabled enemies drops
[2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:23.960]  August 31st on prismplanet.tv
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:25.960]  And chips out September 1st
[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:27.960]  It is my latest, my greatest
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:28.960]  And I think in the next segment
[2:08:28.960 --> 2:08:32.960]  We will play the Israeli operatives chapter
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:33.960]  Or I'm sorry trailer
[2:08:33.960 --> 2:08:35.960]  And right now we have Bob Chapman
[2:08:35.960 --> 2:08:37.960]  Of the international forecaster.com
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:38.960]  On with us
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:39.960]  And we were just discussing
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:40.960]  You know how we need to get rid of
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:43.960]  90 plus percent of the congressional members
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:44.960]  In this country
[2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:45.960]  The house let's get rid of the house
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:47.960]  And I was saying you know
[2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:49.960]  A good test to see if we're willing to do that
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:51.960]  Is if we can get Cindy Sheehan
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:54.960]  In there I mean a woman who is literally sacrificed
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:56.960]  One of her sons overseas in this war
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:08:58.960]  Has been relentless in the last
[2:08:58.960 --> 2:08:59.960]  I'd say what has it been like
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:02.960]  Five, six years in trying to end this war
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:04.960]  And she's come out for 9-11 truth folks
[2:09:04.960 --> 2:09:05.960]  She's very smart
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:06.960]  She's very hip
[2:09:06.960 --> 2:09:08.960]  She's very savvy in what she says
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:09.960]  What do you think Bob?
[2:09:09.960 --> 2:09:11.960]  I think that would be terrific
[2:09:11.960 --> 2:09:12.960]  And I think you're right
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.960]  I think if it looked like
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:15.960]  She had a real shot at it
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:18.960]  I think even in this election
[2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:21.960]  It would encourage people to get rid of
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:24.960]  The likes of Pelosi and other parts of the country
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:26.960]  And all of the rest of them
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:28.960]  They continue to get re-elected
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:30.960]  Because they have the funds to do so
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:34.960]  And then don't represent the constituency
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:36.960]  They go right to the alumnus
[2:09:36.960 --> 2:09:37.960]  And get their payoff
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:39.960]  Which is campaign contributions
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:41.960]  And all the favors that are supplied
[2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:44.960]  To their friends, corporate friends
[2:09:44.960 --> 2:09:49.960]  And personal friends
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:52.960]  And they vote the way they're told to vote
[2:09:52.960 --> 2:09:54.960]  And let's stop there for just one second
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:55.960]  You just said special interest
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:09:57.960]  And they go right to the alumnus
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:09:59.960]  A congressman makes somewhere what?
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:02.960]  Between like 80 Gs and 120 Gs a year
[2:10:02.960 --> 2:10:04.960]  And do you really think that you can win
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:06.960]  A congressional seat on that?
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:07.960]  Of course not
[2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:09.960]  You're owned by your corporate masters, correct Bob?
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:10.960]  Exactly
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:12.960]  And I think the way to handle that
[2:10:12.960 --> 2:10:14.960]  Is everybody who runs for the House and Senate
[2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:17.960]  Is allotted so much money that they can use
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:20.960]  And let's be arbitrarily let's say
[2:10:20.960 --> 2:10:22.960]  Five million dollars
[2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:24.960]  And that's it
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:26.960]  And so that means that someone
[2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:28.960]  Who has piled the money available
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:30.960]  Whether it's personal or not
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:32.960]  Cannot go into a campaign
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:33.960]  And spend 50 million dollars
[2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:37.960]  They have to campaign on the issues
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:38.960]  And that's it
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:40.960]  It would be an amazing thing
[2:10:40.960 --> 2:10:43.960]  It would really be the first step in my eyes
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:45.960]  At restoring the Constitution and Bill of Rights
[2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:47.960]  I mean I think we really have to take
[2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:48.960]  The special interest money out of it
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:49.960]  Because like you said
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:51.960]  When there's no cap on it
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:53.960]  It's kind of like they're the Yankees
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:54.960]  And we're the Brewers
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:55.960]  You know what I'm saying
[2:10:55.960 --> 2:10:57.960]  We don't have a shot to even make the playoffs
[2:10:57.960 --> 2:11:00.960]  But they can just buy any pitcher, catcher
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:02.960]  Anything they need
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:05.960]  And if you can run a 50 million dollar campaign
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:06.960]  For somebody else
[2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:08.960]  And the other candidate can spend 500,000 dollars
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:10.960]  Gee, I wonder who's going to win
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:13.960]  Well, I was certainly born out recently
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:15.960]  In recent years
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:18.960]  By Corzine in New Jersey
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:21.960]  He just poured enormous amounts of money
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:22.960]  Into the campaign
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:26.960]  And you know, that's not what democracy is about
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  And it's got to be stopped
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:31.960]  And of course you have a segment of congress
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:34.960]  That may not be purchased
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:36.960]  But they are compromised
[2:11:36.960 --> 2:11:40.960]  Because they have unusual personal lifestyles
[2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:42.960]  Or have had before
[2:11:42.960 --> 2:11:44.960]  And wait, let me stop you right there
[2:11:44.960 --> 2:11:46.960]  Unusual personal lifestyles
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:48.960]  Does not begin to tell people
[2:11:48.960 --> 2:11:50.960]  What these guys are into
[2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:51.960]  Last night I was actually
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:54.960]  I spent most of my time scanning in
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:56.960]  Alex's Bohemian Grove Anal
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:11:58.960]  So I can put it into PDF format
[2:11:58.960 --> 2:12:00.960]  And throw it in my next film
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:01.960]  Invisible Empire
[2:12:01.960 --> 2:12:02.960]  And we're talking
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:04.960]  Not only the Owl God
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:06.960]  The cremation of care ceremony
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:09.960]  But guys in drag everywhere
[2:12:09.960 --> 2:12:10.960]  I mean, it seems like
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:12.960]  This is like their most fun thing to do
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:13.960]  Is get dressed up in drag
[2:12:13.960 --> 2:12:16.960]  And pretend they're a Broadway star, Bob
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:18.960]  What's up with that?
[2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:21.960]  Well, they call them cross-dressers
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:24.960]  And they've been around for a long time
[2:12:24.960 --> 2:12:29.960]  And many, many of them practice pedophilia
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  And other things that most people
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:34.960]  In society don't do
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:38.960]  And when they get into Congress
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:40.960]  The powers behind Congress, if they know that
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:42.960]  And they usually do
[2:12:42.960 --> 2:12:44.960]  Will approach them and say, look
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:46.960]  If you don't want anybody to know
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:48.960]  That you chase little girls
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:50.960]  Or little boys or whatever
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.960]  Then I think you ought to vote for this issue
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:54.960]  And that issue and that issue and that issue
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:56.960]  And case in point there is like a guy
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:12:57.960]  Like Tom Foley
[2:12:57.960 --> 2:12:59.960]  Who's actually heading up
[2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:01.960]  Like the government's CPS department
[2:13:01.960 --> 2:13:04.960]  Is on TV saying we're going after these predators
[2:13:04.960 --> 2:13:06.960]  We're going to make sure that they pay
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:08.960]  And then it comes out that he's a
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:10.960]  And I'm sure it was a lot more hardcore
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:12.960]  Than what just came out in the mainstream media
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:15.960]  But he is giving quote-unquote inappropriate text
[2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:17.960]  To his 16-year-old page at a high school
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:19.960]  His mail page, by the way
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:21.960]  So the guy at the top
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:24.960]  Who's supposed to be protecting children from predators
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:27.960]  Is preying on children, Bob
[2:13:27.960 --> 2:13:29.960]  It's tragic
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:32.960]  You know, America today
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:34.960]  Has lost their moorings
[2:13:34.960 --> 2:13:36.960]  People shrugged their shoulders and said
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:37.960]  What can I do about it?
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:39.960]  Or what do I care?
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:41.960]  Or let them do what they want
[2:13:41.960 --> 2:13:44.960]  And these sort of people
[2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:48.960]  Really shouldn't be handling responsible positions
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:51.960]  Because most people in society
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:54.960]  Don't do those kind of things
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:13:56.960]  And if they knew it
[2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:59.960]  They might think that they might be hesitant to vote for them
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:01.960]  I would hope so
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:03.960]  Because another thing that really bothers me
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:06.960]  About the Illuminous, this elitist organization
[2:14:06.960 --> 2:14:09.960]  Is that many of them pose as Christian conservatives
[2:14:09.960 --> 2:14:11.960]  With a happy family
[2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:13.960]  They believe in Jesus Christ
[2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:15.960]  And the people that follow them are often
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:17.960]  You know, just mindless Christians
[2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:19.960]  They go to church, they think their church tells them the truth
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:22.960]  They think that George Bush worships Jesus Christ
[2:14:22.960 --> 2:14:24.960]  And then you find out that these guys
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:26.960]  And I'm not a religious guy, I just can't stand the deception
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:28.960]  That these guys are into the occult
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:32.960]  Like the exact opposite
[2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:33.960]  Satanic
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:36.960]  And you know, one of the outstanding figures
[2:14:36.960 --> 2:14:37.960]  Of Satanism
[2:14:37.960 --> 2:14:39.960]  And most people don't know it
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:41.960]  Is George Soros
[2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:42.960]  Is that right? I didn't know that
[2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:43.960]  Why don't you go into that?
[2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:45.960]  I was a billionaire and I was a globalist
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:47.960]  But I didn't know he was into Luciferanism
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:48.960]  Oh yes
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:50.960]  And you know, he
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:53.960]  When he lived in Eastern Europe
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:55.960]  During the 1940s
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:57.960]  And the Germans came in
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:01.960]  He hid his identity
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:03.960]  And went to work with the Germans
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:07.960]  Confiscating the assets of Jewish people
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:10.960]  And that's probably about as low as you can get
[2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:12.960]  In as much as he was Jewish
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:16.960]  And so what he's doing is he's pulling the chain
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:19.960]  And all of his co-religionists
[2:15:19.960 --> 2:15:21.960]  You know, getting them sent off to camps
[2:15:21.960 --> 2:15:24.960]  And they would either work to death
[2:15:24.960 --> 2:15:25.960]  Or whatever happened
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:27.960]  They died most of them
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:30.960]  And here he is running around
[2:15:30.960 --> 2:15:34.960]  Splitting the tank with the Gestapo
[2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:35.960]  And it's sickening
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:36.960]  And here today
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:38.960]  He's the one through his
[2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:40.960]  Non-governmental organizations
[2:15:40.960 --> 2:15:42.960]  NGOs as they're known
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:44.960]  He's the one who
[2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:46.960]  Ten years ago
[2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:49.960]  With his open society funds
[2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:52.960]  And funds from the UN
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:56.960]  Infiltrate all these former Soviet Union countries
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:15:59.960]  Such as Ukraine and Georgia
[2:15:59.960 --> 2:16:02.960]  And many others
[2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:04.960]  And they infiltrated
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:07.960]  They wormed their way into those governments
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:09.960]  And took control of them
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:11.960]  I mean, this guy, Sherith
[2:16:11.960 --> 2:16:14.960]  What is this?
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:16.960]  The one from Georgia
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:18.960]  Oh, Sakha Vili
[2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:20.960]  That's it, Sakha Vili
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:23.960]  I'm not good on linguistics today
[2:16:23.960 --> 2:16:25.960]  He...
[2:16:25.960 --> 2:16:27.960]  And I speak five languages, too
[2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:29.960]  You'll have to excuse me
[2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:30.960]  That's okay
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:33.960]  But anyway, he was trained
[2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:35.960]  For years, in fact
[2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:38.960]  Shaka Vili was at
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:42.960]  The Davos
[2:16:42.960 --> 2:16:44.960]  International business
[2:16:44.960 --> 2:16:45.960]  Gathering
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:47.960]  And for those that don't know what Davos is
[2:16:47.960 --> 2:16:49.960]  Along the same lines of Bilderberg
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:50.960]  And these elitist meetings
[2:16:50.960 --> 2:16:51.960]  That nobody hears about
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:52.960]  Correct, Bob?
[2:16:52.960 --> 2:16:53.960]  Exactly
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:55.960]  And he's there with George
[2:16:55.960 --> 2:16:56.960]  George Soros
[2:16:56.960 --> 2:16:59.960]  So they were lining this guy up for years
[2:16:59.960 --> 2:17:01.960]  And now they have the failure
[2:17:01.960 --> 2:17:03.960]  Of what they did, they're blaming on him
[2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:05.960]  Whether he was the cause of it
[2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:07.960]  Remains to be seen, but I don't think so
[2:17:07.960 --> 2:17:10.960]  It was, again, another poor planning event
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:12.960]  Both by Brzezinski as well as
[2:17:12.960 --> 2:17:14.960]  The White House
[2:17:14.960 --> 2:17:16.960]  I mean, you know, anything
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:18.960]  The guys that can't shoot straight
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:21.960]  I mean, they can't do anything right
[2:17:21.960 --> 2:17:24.960]  I mean, they had over a thousand
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:26.960]  Blackwater advisors
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:30.960]  Over a thousand Israeli advisors
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:32.960]  Who were training them for a long time
[2:17:32.960 --> 2:17:34.960]  They were giving them munitions
[2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:36.960]  For over five years
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:39.960]  And they set up this attack
[2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:41.960]  And then they get defeated
[2:17:41.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  You know, and another thing, too
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.960]  Is that they had to have thought
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:49.960]  That the Russians were going to run in terror
[2:17:49.960 --> 2:17:51.960]  Or not participate
[2:17:51.960 --> 2:17:54.960]  Or sorry, you know, you guys can
[2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:56.960]  Come in here and take this over
[2:17:56.960 --> 2:17:59.960]  But they underestimated Mr. Putin
[2:17:59.960 --> 2:18:02.960]  And the new president
[2:18:02.960 --> 2:18:04.960]  And so they turned around
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:06.960]  And kicked their butts for them
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:08.960]  In fact, the Georgians just ran in terror
[2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:10.960]  Because they expected a lay down
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:12.960]  And that's not what happened
[2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:14.960]  You know, how they could have actually expected a lay down
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  Do you think that was because of, you know, all the NATO forces
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:18.960]  That have surrounded Russia in the previous years
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:20.960]  Do you think that maybe it was the United States
[2:18:20.960 --> 2:18:22.960]  Kind of in their ear going
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:24.960]  Well, you know, you go take South Ossetia
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:26.960]  Maybe you'll be a part of NATO right after that
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.960]  That would be a strong showing
[2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:30.960]  And they did it and then they just got burnt
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:33.960]  Well, it was like a political warfare
[2:18:33.960 --> 2:18:36.960]  Which Brzezinski is very good at
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:38.960]  Probably among the best
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:40.960]  And he blew it. It's as simple as that
[2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:42.960]  Just like the White House
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:44.960]  And the Neocons in America
[2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:46.960]  They blew Iraq and Afghanistan
[2:18:48.960 --> 2:18:50.960]  It's a total cluster
[2:18:50.960 --> 2:18:52.960]  Of mistakes
[2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.960]  And you all know what I'm saying
[2:18:54.960 --> 2:18:56.960]  And finally
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:18:58.960]  The Iraqis are saying
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:00.960]  Please, get out of here
[2:19:00.960 --> 2:19:02.960]  I mean, everything you touch falls down
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.960]  And
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:06.960]  Even they're perpendicular to their skull
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:08.960]  But that's all good for us, Jason
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:10.960]  Because that put
[2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:12.960]  Their plan for world government
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:14.960]  Back 50, maybe 30 to 50 years
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:16.960]  And so that's terrific
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:18.960]  But the point is
[2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:20.960]  That they picked on
[2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:22.960]  The wrong junkyard dog
[2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960]  And that is Mr. Putin
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.960]  And
[2:19:26.960 --> 2:19:28.960]  They changed their whole attitude
[2:19:28.960 --> 2:19:30.960]  You know, I spent a long time spying on
[2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:32.960]  On Russia during the Cold War
[2:19:32.960 --> 2:19:34.960]  And
[2:19:34.960 --> 2:19:36.960]  These people are not dumb
[2:19:36.960 --> 2:19:38.960]  Yeah, the KGB and FSB
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:40.960]  Are pretty intelligent
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:42.960]  I said the FSB
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:44.960]  And the KGB seem to be pretty on the ball
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:46.960]  We'll come back to Bob Chapman after this
[2:19:46.960 --> 2:19:48.960]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:19:48.960 --> 2:19:50.960]  And theInternationalForecaster.com
[2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:02.960]  A day unlike any other
[2:20:02.960 --> 2:20:04.960]  In the long course of American history
[2:20:04.960 --> 2:20:06.960]  The terrorist act of war
[2:20:06.960 --> 2:20:08.960]  Against this country
[2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:10.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11
[2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:12.960]  But who is the enemy?
[2:20:12.960 --> 2:20:14.960]  Bin Laden. This is his MO
[2:20:14.960 --> 2:20:16.960]  We have to look to the Middle East
[2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:18.960]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:20.960]  The Abled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:22.960]  To take a close look at the terrorist ties
[2:20:22.960 --> 2:20:24.960]  To intelligence networks inside the United States
[2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:26.960]  Some U.S. investigators believe that
[2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:28.960]  There are Israelis again very much engaged
[2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:30.960]  In spying in and on the U.S.
[2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:32.960]  I'm aware that
[2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:34.960]  Some Israeli citizens have been detained
[2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:36.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:38.960]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:40.960]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[2:20:40.960 --> 2:20:42.960]  The Israeli intelligence network
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.960]  Warnings and war games
[2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  The shadow government and much, much more
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:48.960]  Fabled enemies

[2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:02.960]  The Chinese government has begun
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:04.960]  A campaign of economic threats
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:06.960]  Against the U.S. hinting liquidation
[2:21:06.960 --> 2:21:08.960]  Of its vast holdings of U.S. treasuries
[2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:10.960]  Responding to Washington's trade sanctions
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:12.960]  Forcing the Yon Revolution
[2:21:12.960 --> 2:21:14.960]  Communist Party bodies of warning
[2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:16.960]  That Beijing is the only country
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:18.960]  In the U.S.
[2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:20.960]  The Chinese government has begun
[2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:22.960]  A campaign of economic threats
[2:21:22.960 --> 2:21:24.960]  Against the U.S. hinting liquidation
[2:21:24.960 --> 2:21:26.960]  Of its vast holdings of U.S.
[2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:28.960]  Treasuries responding to Washington's trade sanctions
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:30.960]  The Communist Party bodies of warning
[2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:32.960]  That Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion
[2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:34.960]  Reserves as a political weapon
[2:21:34.960 --> 2:21:36.960]  Causing bond yields to spike
[2:21:36.960 --> 2:21:38.960]  Hammering the U.S. housing market
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:40.960]  And throwing the economy into a recession
[2:21:40.960 --> 2:21:42.960]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries
[2:21:42.960 --> 2:21:44.960]  Have reduced their holdings due to this threat
[2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:46.960]  Economist Ambrose Evans Prichard
[2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:48.960]  Published the report China Threatens
[2:21:48.960 --> 2:21:50.960]  Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:52.960]  Call for the report today
[2:21:52.960 --> 2:21:54.960]  800-686-2237
[2:21:54.960 --> 2:21:56.960]  The value of your hard earned money
[2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:58.960]  800-686-2237
[2:21:58.960 --> 2:22:00.960]  That's 800-686-2237
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:02.960]  Hey, Clyde!
[2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:04.960]  What's up, Bonnie?
[2:22:04.960 --> 2:22:06.960]  Well, I got a question about those shielded
[2:22:06.960 --> 2:22:08.960]  Secure Sleeves from Identity Stronghold
[2:22:08.960 --> 2:22:10.960]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us from stealing
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:12.960]  Account numbers from the new credit cards
[2:22:12.960 --> 2:22:14.960]  With RFID chips. What about them?
[2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:16.960]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:18.960]  And they went in for them purchasing the Secure Sleeves
[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:20.960]  Oh, Bonnie? If everyone starts hearing
[2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:22.960]  About the Secure Sleeve, it'll destroy our plan
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:24.960]  To steal credit card numbers at the mall
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:26.960]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde
[2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:28.960]  They promise not to tell anyone else
[2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:30.960]  I guess you're right. That's what friends are for, I suppose
[2:22:30.960 --> 2:22:32.960]  Tell them they can get a five pack
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:34.960]  Of Secure Sleeves that will fit credit cards
[2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:36.960]  And driver's licenses for 1995
[2:22:36.960 --> 2:22:38.960]  And Identity Stronghold
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:40.960]  Also has a three pack of Secure Sleeves
[2:22:40.960 --> 2:22:42.960]  For passport books for 1495
[2:22:42.960 --> 2:22:44.960]  And where do they buy them?
[2:22:44.960 --> 2:22:46.960]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form
[2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:48.960]  At idstronghold.com
[2:22:48.960 --> 2:22:50.960]  idstronghold.com
[2:22:50.960 --> 2:22:52.960]  Okay, well, what if they don't have the internet?
[2:22:52.960 --> 2:22:55.960]  You can call 1-800-610-2770
[2:22:55.960 --> 2:22:58.960]  That's 800-610-2770
[2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:00.960]  Thanks, Clyde
[2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:02.960]  Even terrible gas prices
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:04.960]  Don't come close to the disaster
[2:23:04.960 --> 2:23:06.960]  Of food costs from shortages
[2:23:06.960 --> 2:23:08.960]  Already destroying millions of American families
[2:23:08.960 --> 2:23:10.960]  Wheat for flour is already four times
[2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:12.960]  More expensive than it was about a year ago
[2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:14.960]  Food costs continue to double
[2:23:14.960 --> 2:23:16.960]  Because there's no food worldwide
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:18.960]  The only solution is to use now
[2:23:18.960 --> 2:23:20.960]  And store for later
[2:23:20.960 --> 2:23:22.960]  Great flavored super bulk foods
[2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:24.960]  That cost half as much
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:26.960]  As your groceries cost last year
[2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:28.960]  Get on the web at ifoodsdirect.com
[2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:30.960]  And find a two month grab and go kit
[2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:32.960]  This easy fix supply
[2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:34.960]  Gives you two months worth of three
[2:23:34.960 --> 2:23:36.960]  Great meals a day
[2:23:36.960 --> 2:23:38.960]  The cost about five dollars a day
[2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:40.960]  Ifoodsdirect.com
[2:23:40.960 --> 2:23:42.960]  Also has a complete bulk supply
[2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:44.960]  Of super food at half the cost
[2:23:44.960 --> 2:23:46.960]  Of last year's groceries
[2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:48.960]  Call 800-409-5633
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:50.960]  The rest of the world is starving
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:52.960]  But what happens in your piece of America
[2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:54.960]  Is up to you
[2:23:54.960 --> 2:23:56.960]  Call 800-409-5633
[2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:14.960]  I wish a buck was still silver
[2:24:14.960 --> 2:24:16.960]  It was back
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:18.960]  When the country was wrong
[2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:04.960]  Well, it was just like any other job
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:06.960]  And most of what I did
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:08.960]  Was in communications
[2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:10.960]  Counterintelligence
[2:25:10.960 --> 2:25:12.960]  And so I wasn't running around
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:14.960]  With a cloak
[2:25:14.960 --> 2:25:16.960]  And one of those big black hats
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:18.960]  And a dagger
[2:25:18.960 --> 2:25:20.960]  And a gun
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:22.960]  Because I didn't do that sort of thing
[2:25:22.960 --> 2:25:24.960]  I used to
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:26.960]  Work in communications
[2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:28.960]  And we would intercept
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:30.960]  All of the things that
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:32.960]  The Russians and
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:34.960]  What it was then the East Germans
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:36.960]  And the Poles and
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:38.960]  And one of the reasons
[2:25:38.960 --> 2:25:40.960]  I'm so familiar with so many of these regions
[2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:42.960]  Is we would go in
[2:25:42.960 --> 2:25:44.960]  And we would listen in
[2:25:44.960 --> 2:25:46.960]  And copy
[2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:48.960]  The transmissions
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:50.960]  Of the
[2:25:50.960 --> 2:25:52.960]  NKVD
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:54.960]  Or the KGB
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:25:56.960]  Or some
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:25:58.960]  Mechanized army unit
[2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:00.960]  That was stationed in Georgia
[2:26:00.960 --> 2:26:02.960]  Or outside Warsaw
[2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:04.960]  Or wherever
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:06.960]  We did a lot of work with the
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:08.960]  Units and the caucuses
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:10.960]  We copied the
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.960]  Mainline diplomatic operator
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:14.960]  Out of
[2:26:14.960 --> 2:26:16.960]  Moscow
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:18.960]  And we had great success
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:20.960]  In breaking their codes
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:22.960]  But I rather suspect that
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:24.960]  They were equally
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:26.960]  As proficient as we were
[2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:28.960]  And that's
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:30.960]  Basically what I did
[2:26:30.960 --> 2:26:32.960]  But it was an enormous education
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:34.960]  Because the amount
[2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:36.960]  Of information we came
[2:26:36.960 --> 2:26:38.960]  Across was very unusual
[2:26:38.960 --> 2:26:40.960]  And we learned how to
[2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:42.960]  Back into things
[2:26:42.960 --> 2:26:44.960]  That
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:46.960]  You wouldn't be able
[2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:48.960]  To find out what they were doing otherwise
[2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:50.960]  In other words, if there's a train
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:52.960]  Coming from that direction carrying cement
[2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:54.960]  And there's one coming from
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:56.960]  The other direction carrying steel
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:26:58.960]  And they're both going to
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:00.960]  A lot of Ostok, obviously
[2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:02.960]  They're going to build something
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:04.960]  So let's find out what
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:06.960]  Absolutely. So I got
[2:27:06.960 --> 2:27:08.960]  To ask you, what is the most
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:10.960]  Bizarre, crazy thing that you did
[2:27:10.960 --> 2:27:12.960]  Come across that you can talk about?
[2:27:12.960 --> 2:27:14.960]  Well, this is
[2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:16.960]  A funny story.
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:18.960]  We were in our center
[2:27:18.960 --> 2:27:20.960]  In the city that I was in at the time
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:22.960]  And it was Christmas
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:24.960]  And
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:26.960]  The Russians came through in clear text
[2:27:26.960 --> 2:27:28.960]  And
[2:27:28.960 --> 2:27:30.960]  They started telling us
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:32.960]  Our names
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:34.960]  Our ranks
[2:27:34.960 --> 2:27:36.960]  From in on
[2:27:36.960 --> 2:27:38.960]  And they were all drunk
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:40.960]  And because
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:42.960]  They all spoke English
[2:27:42.960 --> 2:27:44.960]  And the thing all got messed up
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:46.960]  But because they were drunk
[2:27:46.960 --> 2:27:48.960]  And they all
[2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:50.960]  We found out later
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:52.960]  Were reprimanded
[2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:54.960]  And reduced in rank
[2:27:54.960 --> 2:27:56.960]  And some of them were put in jail
[2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:58.960]  For doing what they did
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:00.960]  But they let us know
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:02.960]  How successful their counterintelligence
[2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:04.960]  Was in western Germany
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:06.960]  So they basically said, your cover's blown
[2:28:06.960 --> 2:28:08.960]  We know exactly who you are
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:10.960]  Exactly. Which means they had spies
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:12.960]  All over the place.
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:14.960]  And so there wasn't a heck of a lot
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:16.960]  That we didn't know. Now, we had people
[2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:18.960]  Who were with the CIA
[2:28:18.960 --> 2:28:20.960]  In Russia
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:22.960]  But certainly not in the numbers
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:24.960]  That obviously
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:26.960]  The Russians had in western Germany
[2:28:26.960 --> 2:28:28.960]  I mean, it was incredible
[2:28:28.960 --> 2:28:30.960]  I mean, we just stood there with their mouths
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:32.960]  Open and, of course, we weren't drinking
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:34.960]  We were sober
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:36.960]  And it was just an incredible experience
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:38.960]  I mean, that's got to be pretty unnerving, right?
[2:28:38.960 --> 2:28:40.960]  I mean, do you think I better get out of here?
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:42.960]  I mean, do you immediately
[2:28:42.960 --> 2:28:44.960]  No, that didn't bother me at all, Jason
[2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:46.960]  Really? You know, when you're young
[2:28:46.960 --> 2:28:48.960]  And you're
[2:28:48.960 --> 2:28:50.960]  You're well trained
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:52.960]  You know, you like to mix it up
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:54.960]  And anybody that
[2:28:54.960 --> 2:28:56.960]  Gets into that kind of situation
[2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:58.960]  Will tell you that
[2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:00.960]  And
[2:29:00.960 --> 2:29:02.960]  One of the people who did the same kind of work
[2:29:02.960 --> 2:29:04.960]  That I did was part of Goss
[2:29:04.960 --> 2:29:06.960]  Who became later
[2:29:06.960 --> 2:29:08.960]  Head of the Central Intelligence Agency
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:10.960]  Yeah, just a few years ago
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:12.960]  He also headed up the first congressional investigation
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:14.960]  Into 9-11 with Bob Graham
[2:29:14.960 --> 2:29:16.960]  He's a lifelong intelligence guy, isn't he?
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:18.960]  Yes, and he came out
[2:29:18.960 --> 2:29:20.960]  Of the same
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:22.960]  Learning surroundings that I did
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:24.960]  And then in the State Department
[2:29:24.960 --> 2:29:26.960]  We had Peter Galbraith
[2:29:26.960 --> 2:29:28.960]  Who worked there
[2:29:28.960 --> 2:29:30.960]  For, I guess, probably about
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:32.960]  35 years
[2:29:32.960 --> 2:29:34.960]  His father was John Kenneth Belbright, the Economist
[2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:36.960]  Very interesting stuff, Bob
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:38.960]  We've got to come back on the other side, though
[2:29:38.960 --> 2:29:40.960]  And we're going to take your phone calls for Bob Chapman and myself

[2:30:02.960 --> 2:30:04.960]  Along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[2:30:04.960 --> 2:30:06.960]  I went to grounds here
[2:30:06.960 --> 2:30:08.960]  And we knew what to do
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:10.960]  Or at least we thought we did
[2:30:10.960 --> 2:30:12.960]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[2:30:12.960 --> 2:30:14.960]  That finally gives first responders a platform

[2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:34.960]  He had his hand over the radio
[2:30:34.960 --> 2:30:36.960]  While he was getting the countdown
[2:30:36.960 --> 2:30:38.960]  He takes his hand off and you hear it
[2:30:38.960 --> 2:30:40.960]  Three, two, one, and it was boom

[2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:26.960]  And they watch what's happening on my desktop
[2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:28.960]  From their desktop so I can travel the world
[2:31:28.960 --> 2:31:30.960]  And still be here for my date tonight
[2:31:30.960 --> 2:31:59.960]  Thank you for watching!
[2:32:00.960 --> 2:32:02.960]  Are you fed up with all the side effects

[2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:24.960]  Past 4 hours today
[2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:26.960]  And we might just have a special little
[2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:28.960]  Interview for you
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:30.960]  Straight from the DNC there
[2:33:30.960 --> 2:33:32.960]  I don't want to preclude
[2:33:32.960 --> 2:33:34.960]  What's going to happen
[2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:36.960]  But definitely going to have a special guest on
[2:33:36.960 --> 2:33:38.960]  In the final segment
[2:33:38.960 --> 2:33:40.960]  In overdrive
[2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:42.960]  And if you missed my Paul Craig Roberts
[2:33:42.960 --> 2:33:44.960]  Interview earlier today
[2:33:44.960 --> 2:33:46.960]  He really thinks that this could lead to
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:48.960]  A nuclear altercation like no other
[2:33:48.960 --> 2:33:50.960]  One where the United States
[2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:52.960]  Is physically wiped out
[2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:54.960]  And we have us are killed
[2:33:54.960 --> 2:33:56.960]  It was pretty gloom and doom
[2:33:56.960 --> 2:33:58.960]  I'll get Bob Chapman's take on that
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:00.960]  Before we go to that and two year calls
[2:34:00.960 --> 2:34:02.960]  What's your take on a guy like Porter Doss
[2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:04.960]  A lifelong intelligence guy
[2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:06.960]  Heads up the congressional investigation
[2:34:06.960 --> 2:34:08.960]  Into 9-11
[2:34:08.960 --> 2:34:10.960]  Becomes CIA head
[2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:12.960]  I think it was less than a year
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:14.960]  He actually held the position
[2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:16.960]  What interested me about him
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:18.960]  Becoming the head of the CIA
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:20.960]  Is that Michael Moore's people
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:22.960]  I didn't put most of it in
[2:34:22.960 --> 2:34:24.960]  But he actually says that
[2:34:24.960 --> 2:34:26.960]  Well I'm really not qualified to be the head of the CIA
[2:34:26.960 --> 2:34:28.960]  I don't even know how to run email
[2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:30.960]  I can barely use the internet
[2:34:30.960 --> 2:34:32.960]  I really don't have the today's skills
[2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:34.960]  That the head of the CIA would need to be
[2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:36.960]  And then of course
[2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:38.960]  He gets named to head of the CIA
[2:34:38.960 --> 2:34:40.960]  So Moore plays that clip on Jay Leno
[2:34:40.960 --> 2:34:42.960]  What is your take on a guy like Goss
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:44.960]  Well I think that
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:46.960]  He spent
[2:34:46.960 --> 2:34:48.960]  His early years
[2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:50.960]  With the agency
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:52.960]  In Central and South America
[2:34:52.960 --> 2:34:54.960]  Working against Cuba
[2:34:54.960 --> 2:34:56.960]  And so
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:34:58.960]  His perspective probably
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:00.960]  Was relatively narrow
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:02.960]  And
[2:35:02.960 --> 2:35:04.960]  But I think that
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:06.960]  In his experience
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:08.960]  He decided to go along
[2:35:08.960 --> 2:35:10.960]  With the program
[2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:12.960]  He didn't get out of it
[2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:14.960]  And as you know the
[2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:16.960]  Iran Contra episode
[2:35:16.960 --> 2:35:18.960]  Was
[2:35:18.960 --> 2:35:20.960]  Drugs for Guns
[2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:22.960]  And there was a major
[2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:24.960]  Drug running operation
[2:35:24.960 --> 2:35:26.960]  And
[2:35:26.960 --> 2:35:28.960]  For those of you who
[2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:30.960]  Have not
[2:35:30.960 --> 2:35:32.960]  Read into that
[2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:34.960]  There's a book called Compromise
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:36.960]  That was written a number of years ago
[2:35:36.960 --> 2:35:38.960]  It really explains it in detail
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:40.960]  By someone who was involved
[2:35:40.960 --> 2:35:42.960]  In the whole thing
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:44.960]  And so that was really
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:46.960]  It wasn't
[2:35:46.960 --> 2:35:48.960]  A administrative type
[2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:50.960]  Of background
[2:35:50.960 --> 2:35:52.960]  And I think people who run agencies
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:54.960]  Of any kind
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:56.960]  They're
[2:35:56.960 --> 2:35:58.960]  Better off training
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:00.960]  And working inside
[2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:02.960]  And working up within that structure
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:04.960]  Rather than being pulled out of the field
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:06.960]  It's two different lifestyles
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:08.960]  And I think
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:10.960]  Probably that's what he was trying to say
[2:36:10.960 --> 2:36:12.960]  I'll tell you one thing
[2:36:12.960 --> 2:36:14.960]  In intelligence work
[2:36:14.960 --> 2:36:16.960]  I never ran
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:18.960]  Into anybody who was dumb
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:20.960]  And maybe
[2:36:20.960 --> 2:36:22.960]  Goss didn't have
[2:36:22.960 --> 2:36:24.960]  The tools
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:26.960]  To run the CIA
[2:36:26.960 --> 2:36:28.960]  Because he'd never been involved in
[2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:30.960]  Administration, so to speak
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:32.960]  But
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:34.960]  That doesn't mean he
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:36.960]  Wasn't good at what he did
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:38.960]  In undercover work
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:40.960]  Throughout Latin America
[2:36:40.960 --> 2:36:42.960]  No, he seemed to be very successful
[2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:44.960]  At what he did, and he's still around today
[2:36:44.960 --> 2:36:46.960]  And they still put him into positions of power
[2:36:46.960 --> 2:36:48.960]  And he's still kind of a talking head here and there
[2:36:48.960 --> 2:36:50.960]  So obviously he's kind of maintained
[2:36:50.960 --> 2:36:52.960]  A relationship with these guys
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:54.960]  Well, yeah
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:36:56.960]  It's been his whole life
[2:36:56.960 --> 2:36:58.960]  And it's just like my
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:00.960]  And business and finance
[2:37:00.960 --> 2:37:02.960]  And social and political issues
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:04.960]  Have been things that I've worked in
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:06.960]  And talked about for many years
[2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:08.960]  I consider investment
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:10.960]  Part of a mosaic
[2:37:10.960 --> 2:37:12.960]  And a lot of what happens
[2:37:12.960 --> 2:37:14.960]  In investment and where you go
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:16.960]  And what you do is based
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:18.960]  On psycho-political warfare
[2:37:18.960 --> 2:37:20.960]  And when you can see
[2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:22.960]  Things that are developing like you
[2:37:22.960 --> 2:37:24.960]  Referred to just now in relation
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:26.960]  To what Paul Craig Roberts had to say
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:28.960]  In your program, and when he and I
[2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:30.960]  Were on recently, and that is
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:32.960]  What is happening
[2:37:32.960 --> 2:37:34.960]  Today
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:36.960]  In regard to Russia
[2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:38.960]  Is extraordinarily important
[2:37:38.960 --> 2:37:40.960]  It's a major move
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:42.960]  By the
[2:37:42.960 --> 2:37:44.960]  Aluminous powers
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:46.960]  To put Russia in its place
[2:37:46.960 --> 2:37:48.960]  And it's not working
[2:37:48.960 --> 2:37:50.960]  And at the same time
[2:37:50.960 --> 2:37:52.960]  They know that they're not going to be able
[2:37:52.960 --> 2:37:54.960]  To save the financial system
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:37:56.960]  And they want a diversion
[2:37:56.960 --> 2:37:58.960]  And the diversion is another cold war
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:00.960]  And
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:02.960]  Conflict here and there like in Kosovo
[2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:04.960]  And Georgia and perhaps the Ukraine
[2:38:04.960 --> 2:38:06.960]  And other places
[2:38:06.960 --> 2:38:08.960]  And then again
[2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:10.960]  We'll have a bona fide enemy
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:12.960]  And that enemy in this case
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:14.960]  Will be Russia, maybe China as well
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:16.960]  Your analysis is like
[2:38:16.960 --> 2:38:18.960]  Rainbows and sunshine compared
[2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:20.960]  To what Paul Craig Roberts was saying this morning
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:22.960]  He thinks we're on the brink of a
[2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:24.960]  Nuclear war and not one of these
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:26.960]  He specifically said not one of these
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:28.960]  Kid nuclear weapons, but if they
[2:38:28.960 --> 2:38:30.960]  Launch a nuclear attack, he said that they would launch one
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:32.960]  To hit Washington and kill everybody
[2:38:32.960 --> 2:38:34.960]  From Boston to Atlanta
[2:38:34.960 --> 2:38:36.960]  I mean, he was hardcore today, Bob
[2:38:36.960 --> 2:38:38.960]  Well, you know, I'll tell you, he's right
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:40.960]  The only thing is that
[2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:42.960]  And what I'm just
[2:38:42.960 --> 2:38:44.960]  Saying to you previously
[2:38:44.960 --> 2:38:46.960]  That was just a warm up
[2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:48.960]  And the Russians mean business
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:50.960]  And what we've told them
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:52.960]  Is we're going to put
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:54.960]  All kinds of
[2:38:54.960 --> 2:38:56.960]  Armament and offensive
[2:38:56.960 --> 2:38:58.960]  Weapons around you
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:00.960]  So that you can't do anything
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:02.960]  And we're going to isolate you
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:04.960]  And you better like it
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:06.960]  And Russia's saying no, we don't like it
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:08.960]  And we're going to fight back
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:10.960]  And if the western European cities
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:12.960]  Argue, we'll shut off
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:14.960]  All your gas in the middle of winter
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:16.960]  And you'll freeze
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:18.960]  We'll blow all your cities
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:20.960]  In western Europe and your military installations
[2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:22.960]  Up
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:24.960]  And if we have to use nuclear weapons
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:26.960]  We'll use them all over the United States
[2:39:26.960 --> 2:39:28.960]  And yes, we know we're going to pay a price for that
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:30.960]  But we didn't start this thing you did
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:32.960]  And we're not going to lay down for you
[2:39:32.960 --> 2:39:34.960]  So Paul Craig Roberts is right
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:36.960]  It could get there
[2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:38.960]  It is probable
[2:39:38.960 --> 2:39:40.960]  Not just possible
[2:39:40.960 --> 2:39:42.960]  That's insane, I mean that is just
[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:44.960]  I don't know, that's another level
[2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:46.960]  Of depressing for me
[2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:48.960]  Let's take some calls, Bob
[2:39:48.960 --> 2:39:50.960]  Let's jump to Fred in Philly
[2:39:50.960 --> 2:39:52.960]  Fred, what's on your mind?
[2:39:52.960 --> 2:39:54.960]  Fred, are you there?
[2:39:54.960 --> 2:39:56.960]  Alright, if we drop Fred, let's go
[2:39:56.960 --> 2:39:58.960]  We're going to get more depressed
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:00.960]  Well, I mean, like I said
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:02.960]  You couldn't get more depressing than that first segment
[2:40:02.960 --> 2:40:04.960]  I mean, I was literally like
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:06.960]  So what's going to happen?
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:08.960]  Are we talking about a new conscription
[2:40:08.960 --> 2:40:10.960]  For us, a new man Darby?
[2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:12.960]  He's like, no, we're not talking about that
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:14.960]  We're talking about you wake up and there are cities
[2:40:14.960 --> 2:40:16.960]  Gone that most of America is dead
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:18.960]  And I'm just like, wow
[2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:20.960]  That's craziness to me
[2:40:20.960 --> 2:40:22.960]  But this is a guy who's been around
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:24.960]  For 40 plus years
[2:40:24.960 --> 2:40:26.960]  And he's very smart
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:28.960]  His recent articles for counter punch
[2:40:28.960 --> 2:40:30.960]  Have been really pulling no punches
[2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:32.960]  And he's come out a little stronger
[2:40:32.960 --> 2:40:34.960]  For 9-11 Truth recently
[2:40:34.960 --> 2:40:36.960]  And really, I hear some of the background stuff
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:38.960]  When he's talking to Alex off the air
[2:40:38.960 --> 2:40:40.960]  He's a smart guy
[2:40:40.960 --> 2:40:42.960]  Alright, let's go to Fred
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:44.960]  Fred, what's on your mind?
[2:40:44.960 --> 2:40:46.960]  He did just drop
[2:40:46.960 --> 2:40:48.960]  Okay, great
[2:40:48.960 --> 2:40:50.960]  Let's go to Elliot, Ohio
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:52.960]  Then Elliot, what's on your mind?
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:54.960]  We were talking about Bohemian societies
[2:40:54.960 --> 2:40:56.960]  Mixed in with politics
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:40:58.960]  Now
[2:40:58.960 --> 2:41:00.960]  The thing is
[2:41:00.960 --> 2:41:02.960]  When people
[2:41:02.960 --> 2:41:04.960]  Give a lot of animosity
[2:41:04.960 --> 2:41:06.960]  Towards the pagan community
[2:41:06.960 --> 2:41:08.960]  And Aleister Crowley
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:10.960]  They're not getting the full picture
[2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:12.960]  These people
[2:41:12.960 --> 2:41:14.960]  Are selfish, devious
[2:41:14.960 --> 2:41:16.960]  Animals and let's face it
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:18.960]  But when you look into the writings that they studied
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:20.960]  They have misinterpreted
[2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:22.960]  Their whole
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:24.960]  Philosophies and their religion
[2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:26.960]  I mean, in the book of the law of Aleister Crowley
[2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:28.960]  Do what that will to be the whole of the law
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:30.960]  The study of the book is forbidden and it is
[2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:32.960]  Why to destroy this copy after the first reading
[2:41:32.960 --> 2:41:34.960]  Whoever said this regard that
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:36.960]  Does so at his own risk
[2:41:36.960 --> 2:41:38.960]  And these are misdiaries
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:40.960]  Those who discuss the contents of this book
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:42.960]  Are to be shunned by all as centuries of pestilence
[2:41:42.960 --> 2:41:44.960]  All questions of the law are to be decided
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:46.960]  Only by appeal
[2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:48.960]  To my writings
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:50.960]  For himself
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:52.960]  Each for himself
[2:41:52.960 --> 2:41:54.960]  Not for a priesthood
[2:41:54.960 --> 2:41:56.960]  Not for a satanic priest
[2:41:56.960 --> 2:41:58.960]  A ruler, a leader
[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:00.960]  No, each for himself
[2:42:00.960 --> 2:42:02.960]  There is no lobby I'll do with that
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:04.960]  Well, love is the law of love under will
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:06.960]  And then when people give him craft
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:08.960]  For
[2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:10.960]  Killing 120
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:12.960]  Children
[2:42:12.960 --> 2:42:14.960]  They're also misinterpreting
[2:42:14.960 --> 2:42:16.960]  Just before you get to that part
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:18.960]  Is a book that he wrote
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:20.960]  That he was supposedly channeled by separate
[2:42:20.960 --> 2:42:22.960]  Deities, entities, demons
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:24.960]  Whatever you want to call them, correct?
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:26.960]  Yeah, he took his wife to Egypt
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:28.960]  Back in 1903
[2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:30.960]  He had
[2:42:30.960 --> 2:42:32.960]  A particular ritual
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:34.960]  According to him he was
[2:42:34.960 --> 2:42:36.960]  He got
[2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:38.960]  The deity
[2:42:38.960 --> 2:42:40.960]  Horus
[2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:42.960]  The deity Nuit
[2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:44.960]  The deity Hadid
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:46.960]  The earth god
[2:42:46.960 --> 2:42:48.960]  And poor poor crott
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:50.960]  Or Horus
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:52.960]  Book of the warring child
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:54.960]  The three books
[2:42:54.960 --> 2:42:56.960]  So your basic point is that
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:42:58.960]  These guys don't even follow their own occultic beliefs?
[2:42:58.960 --> 2:43:00.960]  No, they are
[2:43:00.960 --> 2:43:02.960]  In chapter 12 Crowley even states that
[2:43:02.960 --> 2:43:04.960]  He wouldn't like
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:06.960]  If he was still alive, he wouldn't like what they're doing today
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:08.960]  In chapter 12
[2:43:08.960 --> 2:43:10.960]  It's the chapter that all the people
[2:43:10.960 --> 2:43:12.960]  That say he's a child killer
[2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:14.960]  Or like killing 120 people
[2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:16.960]  No, he was partaking in a sexual magic
[2:43:16.960 --> 2:43:18.960]  Sex magic ritual
[2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:20.960]  With his partner
[2:43:20.960 --> 2:43:22.960]  He had sex 120 times with his partner
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:24.960]  And he sacrificed in a sense
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:26.960]  Children
[2:43:26.960 --> 2:43:28.960]  He was pretty much saying
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:29.960]  I didn't get her part
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:30.960]  Alright Elliot, I thank you for the call
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:32.960]  It's an interesting interpretation
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:34.960]  I'm not going to sit here and defend
[2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:36.960]  Allister Crowley in any way, shape or form
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:38.960]  I have some kind of, I don't know whether
[2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:40.960]  You're a paganist or maybe you're into
[2:43:40.960 --> 2:43:42.960]  What kind of wicked beliefs
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:44.960]  Maybe you're not, maybe you're totally against them
[2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:46.960]  But I don't think Crowley was a good guy
[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:48.960]  I mean, I've studied into it
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:50.960]  Didn't both of his kids wind up dead
[2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:52.960]  You know, under really mysterious circumstances
[2:43:52.960 --> 2:43:54.960]  So, you know, and if you've seen
[2:43:54.960 --> 2:43:56.960]  Like the writings from the book of the law
[2:43:56.960 --> 2:43:58.960]  They're kind of like all over the place
[2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:00.960]  I guess they're made to look like
[2:44:00.960 --> 2:44:02.960]  He was being channeled by other beings
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:04.960]  You got any comments on Crowley, Mr. Chapman?
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:06.960]  I've read a great deal
[2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:08.960]  About him
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:10.960]  And he
[2:44:10.960 --> 2:44:12.960]  His thought process lurks
[2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:16.960]  At the base of
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:18.960]  What Aluminism is
[2:44:18.960 --> 2:44:20.960]  And
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:22.960]  It's the sort of thing that
[2:44:22.960 --> 2:44:24.960]  The black nobility in Europe
[2:44:24.960 --> 2:44:26.960]  Have been involved in for centuries
[2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:28.960]  And
[2:44:28.960 --> 2:44:30.960]  He wrote a book about it
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:32.960]  And had he not, we
[2:44:32.960 --> 2:44:34.960]  Wouldn't have known his thoughts
[2:44:34.960 --> 2:44:36.960]  And the thoughts of many others who
[2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:38.960]  Shared his viewpoint
[2:44:38.960 --> 2:44:40.960]  And which
[2:44:40.960 --> 2:44:42.960]  To me is just pure Satanism
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:44.960]  And
[2:44:44.960 --> 2:44:46.960]  Like yourself
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:48.960]  I don't have anything good to say about him
[2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:50.960]  I find it surprising
[2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:52.960]  When people do
[2:44:52.960 --> 2:44:54.960]  And you know
[2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:56.960]  I think that these guys do their own flavor
[2:44:56.960 --> 2:44:58.960]  Of whatever feels good
[2:44:58.960 --> 2:45:00.960]  That's what the ultimate root of Luciferianism is
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:02.960]  Do is thou wilt
[2:45:02.960 --> 2:45:04.960]  So they're probably, no matter
[2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:06.960]  What these teachings they've learned
[2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:08.960]  No matter what secret societies they're in
[2:45:08.960 --> 2:45:10.960]  And what level they are
[2:45:10.960 --> 2:45:12.960]  In masonry or knights' templar
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:14.960]  Or any of these organizations
[2:45:14.960 --> 2:45:16.960]  I think it comes down to the bottom line
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:18.960]  That in their brain
[2:45:18.960 --> 2:45:20.960]  And that this goes for the majority of them
[2:45:20.960 --> 2:45:22.960]  That are in power, they do what they want
[2:45:22.960 --> 2:45:24.960]  And it doesn't matter who's in the lane
[2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:26.960]  The ends justifies the means
[2:45:26.960 --> 2:45:28.960]  And the ends are for them
[2:45:28.960 --> 2:45:30.960]  It's not for humanity
[2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:32.960]  Alright, let's jump to another caller
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:34.960]  To Elizabeth in Maryland
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:36.960]  Elizabeth, what's on your mind?
[2:45:36.960 --> 2:45:38.960]  Congratulations to you, Jason, on your film
[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:40.960]  This is Elizabeth Border
[2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:42.960]  From The Divided Kingdom
[2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:44.960]  The other GCN program that's on in the evenings
[2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:46.960]  And I really originally called in
[2:45:46.960 --> 2:45:48.960]  To talk to Rosalind Peterson
[2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:50.960]  About the chemtrails
[2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:52.960]  But it all fits together
[2:45:52.960 --> 2:45:54.960]  And as Bob knows
[2:45:54.960 --> 2:45:56.960]  I've interviewed him various times
[2:45:56.960 --> 2:45:58.960]  And I have great respect for his
[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:00.960]  Incise of mind and his judgment
[2:46:00.960 --> 2:46:02.960]  And what occurs to me
[2:46:02.960 --> 2:46:04.960]  I'm very glad that you both brought up
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:06.960]  The Bohemian Grove situation
[2:46:06.960 --> 2:46:08.960]  And I believe this is really
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:10.960]  As Bob said
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:12.960]  What lurks at the bottom of the Illuminous
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:14.960]  Ideology, it really is
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:16.960]  Satanism
[2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:18.960]  And I think for that reason
[2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:20.960]  What I wanted to say, I do hope that people
[2:46:20.960 --> 2:46:22.960]  This is not self-serving
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:24.960]  I get no money really from this at all
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:26.960]  I hope that people will go to Radio Liberty
[2:46:26.960 --> 2:46:30.960]  And get my books paid
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:34.960]  With much, much more information
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:36.960]  Than weather modification
[2:46:36.960 --> 2:46:38.960]  Again, I think there's an underbelly
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:40.960]  To this, and from my book
[2:46:40.960 --> 2:46:42.960]  One of the little facts
[2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:44.960]  That shows all of this is a global plan
[2:46:44.960 --> 2:46:46.960]  There was the fact
[2:46:46.960 --> 2:46:48.960]  That the chemtrail springs
[2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:50.960]  Of the Croatian town of Rijeka
[2:46:50.960 --> 2:46:52.960]  R-Y-I-K-A, Bob, I hope I'm pronouncing that right
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:54.960]  But anyway, the springs
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:46:56.960]  There started the next day
[2:46:56.960 --> 2:46:58.960]  After Croatia entered the partnership
[2:46:58.960 --> 2:47:00.960]  For peace
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:02.960]  So this writer observing this
[2:47:02.960 --> 2:47:04.960]  Concluded that NATO is the executive branch
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:06.960]  Of the real chemtrail spring operation
[2:47:06.960 --> 2:47:08.960]  And I want to make one other point
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:10.960]  There really are chemtrails
[2:47:10.960 --> 2:47:12.960]  There is no conspiracy because
[2:47:12.960 --> 2:47:14.960]  Dennis Kacinic introduced a bill
[2:47:14.960 --> 2:47:16.960]  In 2001 called
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:18.960]  The Space Preservation Act
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:20.960]  2977
[2:47:20.960 --> 2:47:22.960]  It listed chemtrails
[2:47:22.960 --> 2:47:24.960]  As one of the space weapons
[2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:26.960]  But you know what happened
[2:47:26.960 --> 2:47:28.960]  Some time later, as Bob says
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:30.960]  Sometimes these people get messages
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:32.960]  They've gone too far
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:34.960]  That word was removed
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:36.960]  So I want to commend you both
[2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:38.960]  For what you're doing
[2:47:38.960 --> 2:47:40.960]  And of course, Alex Jones for what he's doing
[2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:42.960]  I have been following him
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:44.960]  Since June the 2nd, 2003
[2:47:44.960 --> 2:47:46.960]  That was the first time I ever turned on Alex
[2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:48.960]  And what do you think, guys, he was talking about
[2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:50.960]  How the elite of the world
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:52.960]  Kill the children
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:54.960]  Torture them and so forth and so on
[2:47:54.960 --> 2:47:56.960]  And from that day on, I knew
[2:47:56.960 --> 2:47:58.960]  Part of my destiny had to be
[2:47:58.960 --> 2:48:00.960]  To speak out against the evil
[2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:02.960]  So thank you both, Bob
[2:48:02.960 --> 2:48:04.960]  I hope one day I'll interview you again
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:06.960]  Thank you, Jason, I look forward to your film
[2:48:06.960 --> 2:48:08.960]  Alright, thank you so much, Elizabeth
[2:48:08.960 --> 2:48:10.960]  And yeah, I mean, when I started
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:12.960]  To come to that realization that these guys
[2:48:12.960 --> 2:48:14.960]  Were into not only torture and bizarre rituals
[2:48:14.960 --> 2:48:16.960]  But child-killing
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:18.960]  I mean, read the Franklin cover-up
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:20.960]  And check out Conspiracy of Silence online
[2:48:20.960 --> 2:48:22.960]  I'll take you 45 minutes, it's ultra-sickening
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:24.960]  But yeah, that's one of the reasons I'm in this
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:26.960]  I mean, if your heart is dark enough
[2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:28.960]  To take advantage of a child
[2:48:28.960 --> 2:48:30.960]  Your heart is dark enough to do
[2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:32.960]  Just about anything and it is
[2:48:32.960 --> 2:48:34.960]  Very, very, very disturbing
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:36.960]  Bob, what is your take on the chem trail issue?
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:38.960]  We had Rosalind Peterson on for an hour
[2:48:38.960 --> 2:48:40.960]  She is very cautious
[2:48:40.960 --> 2:48:42.960]  To not use that word but use
[2:48:42.960 --> 2:48:44.960]  Weather modification and then the
[2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:46.960]  Actual metals that are found
[2:48:46.960 --> 2:48:48.960]  From this weather modification
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:50.960]  What's your take?
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:52.960]  Well, I think that they're using it
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:54.960]  To influence disease
[2:48:54.960 --> 2:48:56.960]  Upon people
[2:48:56.960 --> 2:48:58.960]  And
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:00.960]  To control
[2:49:00.960 --> 2:49:02.960]  Things within our atmosphere
[2:49:02.960 --> 2:49:04.960]  Stratosphere
[2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:06.960]  And I think they've been doing it
[2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:08.960]  All over the world
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:10.960]  I travel
[2:49:10.960 --> 2:49:12.960]  And you see them in Europe
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:14.960]  You see them in South America
[2:49:14.960 --> 2:49:16.960]  Mexico, Canada
[2:49:16.960 --> 2:49:18.960]  So
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:20.960]  It's a process which is ongoing
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:22.960]  And they're not doing it for nothing
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:24.960]  And so whatever
[2:49:24.960 --> 2:49:26.960]  Scientists say
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:28.960]  That they are doing, they are
[2:49:28.960 --> 2:49:30.960]  No, I agree
[2:49:30.960 --> 2:49:32.960]  And they're just going to keep it under wraps
[2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:34.960]  And keep denying and keep denying
[2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:36.960]  And then when they reveal
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:38.960]  As they're doing partially now, saying it's a NASA program
[2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:40.960]  To stop global warming
[2:49:40.960 --> 2:49:42.960]  It'll be to save us
[2:49:42.960 --> 2:49:44.960]  Even though it's sitting there
[2:49:44.960 --> 2:49:46.960]  After they poisoned this
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:48.960]  Exactly, after we've ingested it
[2:49:48.960 --> 2:49:50.960]  And you know, cancer's gone up
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:52.960]  Another 35%
[2:49:52.960 --> 2:49:54.960]  And respiratory illness has gone up
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:56.960]  And our immunity to certain things
[2:49:56.960 --> 2:49:58.960]  Is no longer there, they'll say
[2:49:58.960 --> 2:50:00.960]  Oh, well, we're helping you
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:02.960]  Because otherwise the planet would be too hot
[2:50:02.960 --> 2:50:04.960]  By the way, have you paid your carbon credits this month?
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:06.960]  It's absolute and complete insanity
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:08.960]  Total acclamation and it just shows
[2:50:08.960 --> 2:50:10.960]  How easy it is
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:12.960]  To trick the American sheeple
[2:50:12.960 --> 2:50:14.960]  Into just not paying attention
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:16.960]  And denying its existence
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:18.960]  It's so easy once the main line says
[2:50:18.960 --> 2:50:20.960]  This doesn't exist for other people
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:22.960]  To pair it that same line, no matter
[2:50:22.960 --> 2:50:24.960]  How much evidence is right in your face
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:26.960]  Alright, let's jump to Mark in Oregon
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:28.960]  Mark, what's on your mind?
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:30.960]  Hello, Jason and Bob, how y'all doing today?
[2:50:30.960 --> 2:50:32.960]  And great to speak with you
[2:50:32.960 --> 2:50:34.960]  Jason?
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:36.960]  Can I wait to the other side?
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:38.960]  Well, get out the question and we'll take you on the other side
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:40.960]  Speaking this morning kind of is the main theme
[2:50:40.960 --> 2:50:42.960]  Of this show about the
[2:50:42.960 --> 2:50:44.960]  Danger of nuclear war spreading
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:46.960]  To this country from Russia
[2:50:46.960 --> 2:50:48.960]  And what I've seen as far as the Bush
[2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:50.960]  Administration
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:52.960]  Their operations
[2:50:52.960 --> 2:50:54.960]  Have gone flawlessly since the day
[2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:56.960]  That they came into power
[2:50:56.960 --> 2:50:58.960]  Alright, hold that thought, we'll be back after this
[2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:00.960]  It's the Alex Jones Show, I'm Jason Bermas
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:02.960]  Infowars.com, Prison Planet
[2:51:02.960 --> 2:51:04.960]  A day unlike any other in the long course
[2:51:04.960 --> 2:51:06.960]  Of American history, a terrorist act
[2:51:06.960 --> 2:51:08.960]  Against this country
[2:51:08.960 --> 2:51:10.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[2:51:10.960 --> 2:51:12.960]  But who is the enemy?
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:14.960]  bin Laden, this is his MO
[2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:16.960]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:18.960]  Fabled enemies is the first 9-11
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:20.960]  Film to take a close look
[2:51:20.960 --> 2:51:22.960]  At the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[2:51:22.960 --> 2:51:24.960]  Inside the United States
[2:51:24.960 --> 2:51:26.960]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis
[2:51:26.960 --> 2:51:28.960]  Again very much engaged
[2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:30.960]  In spying in and on the US
[2:51:30.960 --> 2:51:32.960]  I'm aware that
[2:51:32.960 --> 2:51:34.960]  Some Israeli citizens have been detained
[2:51:34.960 --> 2:51:36.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:38.960]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:40.960]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[2:51:40.960 --> 2:51:42.960]  The Israeli intelligence network
[2:51:42.960 --> 2:51:44.960]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government
[2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:46.960]  And much, much more, fabled enemies
[2:51:46.960 --> 2:51:48.960]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com
[2:51:48.960 --> 2:51:50.960]  Or see it in super high quality

[2:51:56.960 --> 2:51:58.960]  Or you are with the terrorists
[2:52:00.960 --> 2:52:02.960]  Alabama State Code makes it
[2:52:02.960 --> 2:52:04.960]  Illegal to drive barefoot
[2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:06.960]  In Downey, California
[2:52:06.960 --> 2:52:08.960]  It's illegal to wash your car in the street
[2:52:08.960 --> 2:52:10.960]  In Minnesota, you can be fine
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:12.960]  For displaying that your vehicle is for sale
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:14.960]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us
[2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:16.960]  But instead to help states profit
[2:52:16.960 --> 2:52:18.960]  The use of red light cameras is another great example
[2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:20.960]  They intrude on your privacy
[2:52:20.960 --> 2:52:22.960]  Are unconstitutional
[2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:24.960]  And cost you valuable time and money

[2:53:04.960 --> 2:53:06.960]  80% of all Americans
[2:53:06.960 --> 2:53:08.960]  And 85% of people around the world
[2:53:08.960 --> 2:53:10.960]  Suffer from internal parasites
[2:53:10.960 --> 2:53:12.960]  And parasitic infection
[2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:14.960]  You may be one of millions of people suffering
[2:53:14.960 --> 2:53:16.960]  From one of dozens of debilitating chronic diseases
[2:53:16.960 --> 2:53:18.960]  From these parasites and your doctor
[2:53:18.960 --> 2:53:20.960]  Would never know it
[2:53:20.960 --> 2:53:22.960]  In fact, clinically detected parasites
[2:53:22.960 --> 2:53:24.960]  Account for only 1% of all cases
[2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:26.960]  Don't continue to suffer from pain
[2:53:26.960 --> 2:53:28.960]  You can fight internal parasites

[2:54:24.960 --> 2:54:26.960]  I'm going to have to get back to that later
[2:54:26.960 --> 2:54:28.960]  In the show when we take some more calls

[2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:40.960]  Might see you even before the end of the week
[2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:42.960]  Give out the website one more time, Bob
[2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:44.960]  The internationalforecaster.com
[2:54:44.960 --> 2:54:46.960]  The internationalforecaster.com
[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:52.960]  Alright Bob, thank you so much for joining us
[2:54:52.960 --> 2:54:54.960]  And we'll be talking to you soon
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:56.960]  Alright, we now have Alex Jones on the line
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:54:58.960]  Straight from the DNC in Denver
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:00.960]  Remember we're streaming live video
[2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:02.960]  From infowars.com right now
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:04.960]  Hey Alex, what's up?
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:06.960]  Hey, I'm in a diner
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:08.960]  We're having to squeeze everything in
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:10.960]  So there's a lot of background noise
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:12.960]  Am I transmitting to you well?
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:14.960]  Okay, here's the deal
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:16.960]  Did you get the word and you made the announcement
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:18.960]  We're going to be interviewing Ralph Nader live
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:20.960]  At 3 o'clock Central when you go into Overdrive
[2:55:20.960 --> 2:55:22.960]  Well I said that we would have a special guest
[2:55:22.960 --> 2:55:24.960]  But you just dropped who it was, yes
[2:55:24.960 --> 2:55:26.960]  Okay, good
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:28.960]  Yeah, they called us
[2:55:28.960 --> 2:55:30.960]  And said, do you want to interview Ralph Nader?
[2:55:30.960 --> 2:55:33.960]  I've also been invited to the big event tonight
[2:55:33.960 --> 2:55:35.960]  Or with all these folks
[2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:37.960]  Perhaps to speak, I've got to go meet with Nader
[2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:39.960]  In the next hour
[2:55:39.960 --> 2:55:41.960]  But I didn't even try to get into it
[2:55:41.960 --> 2:55:43.960]  So that's great, we'll see if that happens
[2:55:43.960 --> 2:55:45.960]  You have showed that we're going to have live
[2:55:45.960 --> 2:55:47.960]  Video feeds for you
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:49.960]  As long as this system holds out
[2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:51.960]  The problem is I continue
[2:55:51.960 --> 2:55:53.960]  When I'm shooting camera, pulling the fire wire
[2:55:53.960 --> 2:55:55.960]  Out of the camera
[2:55:55.960 --> 2:55:57.960]  Or if we finally discovered it, if you wiggle it
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:55:59.960]  It knocks you off live
[2:55:59.960 --> 2:56:01.960]  But this technology is in its infancy
[2:56:01.960 --> 2:56:03.960]  By next year it'll be the size of a cigarette lighter
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:05.960]  Right now it's a big laptop
[2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:07.960]  Equipment, a bunch of wires and batteries
[2:56:07.960 --> 2:56:09.960]  But
[2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:11.960]  We're going to go into overdrive
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:13.960]  In an hour and five minutes
[2:56:13.960 --> 2:56:15.960]  I want you to do 30 minutes of overdrive
[2:56:15.960 --> 2:56:17.960]  Or however long, Jason, it takes
[2:56:17.960 --> 2:56:19.960]  Of course
[2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:21.960]  For us to continue
[2:56:21.960 --> 2:56:23.960]  And so just you jump in any time
[2:56:23.960 --> 2:56:25.960]  You'll hear us setting up, you'll hear us
[2:56:25.960 --> 2:56:27.960]  You'll write a 2-10 or so
[2:56:27.960 --> 2:56:29.960]  Doing the interview, I'm going to have the cell phone open
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:31.960]  So John Harmon can fade that up
[2:56:31.960 --> 2:56:33.960]  If the Justin TV live
[2:56:33.960 --> 2:56:35.960]  Video feed goes down
[2:56:35.960 --> 2:56:37.960]  And so I want you guys to stay your discretion
[2:56:37.960 --> 2:56:39.960]  With John Harmon on his hand
[2:56:39.960 --> 2:56:41.960]  Well, actually, we'll be switching
[2:56:41.960 --> 2:56:43.960]  From that network now to Paul Hartman
[2:56:43.960 --> 2:56:45.960]  Paul, our new IP guy
[2:56:45.960 --> 2:56:47.960]  Showed up yet for the next hour overdrive
[2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:49.960]  Yeah, he's there
[2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:51.960]  Yeah, but if we don't have any time
[2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:53.960]  We're going to be strategizing on air here
[2:56:53.960 --> 2:56:55.960]  Okay, good, then actually
[2:56:55.960 --> 2:56:57.960]  I need him to pull up, or you to pull up
[2:56:57.960 --> 2:56:59.960]  On your computer
[2:56:59.960 --> 2:57:01.960]  So I wish we had the bars out of my laptop in there
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:03.960]  Well, the problem with your laptop actually today, Alex
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:05.960]  Is that I need the administration password
[2:57:05.960 --> 2:57:07.960]  To get on it and I've been using my laptop
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:09.960]  So I can't even get on your laptop right now
[2:57:09.960 --> 2:57:11.960]  Unless you've got the password
[2:57:11.960 --> 2:57:13.960]  Well, the password is right there on the main screen when it comes up
[2:57:13.960 --> 2:57:15.960]  So I'll give you the password off air
[2:57:15.960 --> 2:57:17.960]  Okay, sounds good, sounds good
[2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:19.960]  Oh, God, it never ends
[2:57:19.960 --> 2:57:21.960]  There's only one IT guy there right now?
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:23.960]  Yeah, Paul's the only one here right now
[2:57:23.960 --> 2:57:25.960]  Well, if you ask people about that
[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:27.960]  You can get that fixed
[2:57:27.960 --> 2:57:29.960]  Okay, well, I just came in 15 minutes ago
[2:57:29.960 --> 2:57:31.960]  So I just got to make sure
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:33.960]  Okay, well, call the other person
[2:57:33.960 --> 2:57:35.960]  Anyways, the point is here, ladies and gentlemen
[2:57:35.960 --> 2:57:37.960]  You're in the middle of the war room here
[2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:39.960]  I want you to be fading up the Justin T.V. live audio feed
[2:57:39.960 --> 2:57:41.960]  For folks at infoworks.com
[2:57:41.960 --> 2:57:43.960]  At 3 o'clock central
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:45.960]  Let me go live with Ralph Nader
[2:57:45.960 --> 2:57:47.960]  You'll also have my cell phone
[2:57:47.960 --> 2:57:49.960]  Feed there for you to get that
[2:57:49.960 --> 2:57:51.960]  As well, okay, so you'll have two feeds
[2:57:51.960 --> 2:57:53.960]  Cell phone, so I will need
[2:57:53.960 --> 2:57:55.960]  You guys to have me
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:57:57.960]  On the phone system there
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:57:59.960]  Queued up, and I gave these orders earlier
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:01.960]  But I just wanted to make sure
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:03.960]  That everything was straightened out
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:05.960]  So we can do this, and I appreciate you doing it, Jason
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:07.960]  We really appreciate you
[2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:09.960]  There's a lot of bedlam going on here
[2:58:09.960 --> 2:58:11.960]  But we will be
[2:58:11.960 --> 2:58:13.960]  In fact, I need the guys to I am me
[2:58:13.960 --> 2:58:15.960]  Just the number I'm supposed to call in
[2:58:15.960 --> 2:58:17.960]  On for backups here
[2:58:17.960 --> 2:58:19.960]  I'm going to be busy setting up a live shoot
[2:58:19.960 --> 2:58:21.960]  With Ralph Nader for this interview
[2:58:21.960 --> 2:58:23.960]  So we're going on the radio, we're going on Justin T.V.
[2:58:23.960 --> 2:58:25.960]  We're going to go out on prisonplanet.tv
[2:58:25.960 --> 2:58:27.960]  It's going to go out everywhere
[2:58:27.960 --> 2:58:29.960]  In overdrive, at least 30 minutes from overdrive
[2:58:29.960 --> 2:58:31.960]  With Ralph Nader with Jason Bermas
[2:58:31.960 --> 2:58:33.960]  They're riding shotguns, so I appreciate you, Jason
[2:58:33.960 --> 2:58:35.960]  There's Michelle Malka stuff's getting crazy

[2:58:37.960 --> 2:58:39.960]  Inside Edition T.V. crew live feed?
[2:58:39.960 --> 2:59:00.960]  Not yet.

[2:59:41.960 --> 2:59:43.960]  And hundreds of other titles

[2:59:45.960 --> 2:59:47.960]  Truth is our word
[2:59:47.960 --> 2:59:49.960]  Alright folks, we are locked and loaded
[2:59:49.960 --> 2:59:51.960]  Live
[2:59:51.960 --> 2:59:53.960]  For the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show
[2:59:53.960 --> 2:59:55.960]  With Alex Jones right now reporting live
[2:59:55.960 --> 2:59:57.960]  From the DNC and you cut off
[2:59:57.960 --> 2:59:59.960]  With talking about that live feed
[2:59:59.960 --> 3:00:01.960]  From Inside Edition
[3:00:01.960 --> 3:00:03.960]  We were not able to play that
[3:00:03.960 --> 3:00:05.960]  I've been refreshing my Justin T.V.
[3:00:05.960 --> 3:00:07.960]  Wurbs here and there, why don't you
[3:00:07.960 --> 3:00:09.960]  Describe for us, Alex?
[3:00:09.960 --> 3:00:11.960]  Well, we get this call from Inside Edition
[3:00:11.960 --> 3:00:13.960]  This morning and I said
[3:00:13.960 --> 3:00:15.960]  We want to call over your condo
[3:00:15.960 --> 3:00:17.960]  The condo we rented for the week right now
[3:00:17.960 --> 3:00:19.960]  And so we queue up the tapes
[3:00:19.960 --> 3:00:21.960]  We queue up them pushing us first
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:23.960]  We queue up Malcolm's people
[3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:25.960]  We queue up Malcolm's people posing with us
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:27.960]  And then screaming kill Michelle Malcolm
[3:00:27.960 --> 3:00:29.960]  We show them
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:31.960]  Separate media, YouTube clips
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:33.960]  We got it all queued up for them
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:35.960]  And they basically didn't want it
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:37.960]  They just didn't want it
[3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:39.960]  They wanted me screaming at Michelle Malcolm
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:41.960]  And then they said, why did you pick on a little sweet lady
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:43.960]  Basically? And then they had a live feed
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:45.960]  Back to their satellite truck downstairs
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:47.960]  Beaming it to New York
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:49.960]  Where they're going to edit it for the piece
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:51.960]  That's going to air on the East Coast
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:53.960]  In fact, it's starting to air right now
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:55.960]  People to tape Inside Edition
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:00:57.960]  And I noticed that in the message boards
[3:00:57.960 --> 3:00:59.960]  Our listeners have already found the Inside Edition phone number
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:01.960]  And they've been calling them and they're saying
[3:01:01.960 --> 3:01:03.960]  That was Malcolm
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:05.960]  That was an hour ago
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:07.960]  But it's just amazing
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:09.960]  Here's this woman calling for concentration camps
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:11.960]  For American political dissidents, Arabs, Muslims
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:13.960]  Torture's good, secret arrest is good
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:15.960]  She said I'm a liar about the Marines killing a puppy
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:17.960]  When it's even admitted that they did kill the puppy
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:19.960]  I mean, it's just that there's no end to her
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:21.960]  It's on video, come on
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:23.960]  We have the whole video
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:25.960]  I came up, it was nice at first
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:27.960]  And our people got in my face and I pushed them back
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:29.960]  They were bumping into me and they grabbed our camera
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:31.960]  And it just shows how sick and mentally ill
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:33.960]  Our society is
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:35.960]  And even mainline, you know, Inside Edition
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:37.960]  Alex Jones, the big bully
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:39.960]  Is mean to the little sweetie pie
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:41.960]  The O'Reilly co-host to the past
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:43.960]  Michelle Malcolm
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:45.960]  But the good news is they're still operating
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:47.960]  In an old paradigm where they can lie to store and manipulate
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:49.960]  And we'll see what happens
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:51.960]  It might be fair, but I don't think so
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:53.960]  And it didn't matter, we were streaming live on the web
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:55.960]  And we even told them that
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:01:57.960]  It's like they didn't even connect or notice
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:01:59.960]  So that went out there
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:01.960]  In fact, that will post to archives
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.960]  On JustinTV, you click archives
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:05.960]  And you can
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:07.960]  Watch it right there in the archives
[3:02:07.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  Maybe after Overdrive, maybe at 3.30
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:11.960]  After the Nader interview, you just want to play that out
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:13.960]  For the listeners or people can go there
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:15.960]  And watch it for themselves
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:17.960]  But I'm going to let you get back to work
[3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:19.960]  We're going to dial in to the system
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:21.960]  Phone network in about 15 minutes with cell phones
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:23.960]  We at least have that for the Nader interview
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:25.960]  And also the JustinTV is going to go live
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  In 10 minutes before we get with Nader
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:29.960]  Before we go Alex, I want to get your comments
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:31.960]  On Mashable.com
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:33.960]  Who's saying that you're the one that called for her death
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:35.960]  They're also calling you this ultra leftist
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:37.960]  And there's this Australian newspaper
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:39.960]  Here, the donkey Bray
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:41.960]  That's also saying you're an ultra leftist
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:43.960]  And you called for her death
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:45.960]  Isn't it convenient how
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:47.960]  You go from ultra right wing
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:49.960]  To ultra left wing all the time
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:51.960]  When you're not right or left
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:53.960]  Well, we've also found out that these same people
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:55.960]  Were with her the day before the protest
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:57.960]  The one that Fox Newscapped for people flipping them off
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:02:59.960]  And that they screamed again
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:01.960]  Kill Michelle Malkin, kill Michelle Malkin
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:03.960]  I mean, these guys
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  And then when leftists went around us
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:07.960]  They would say, it's Alex Jones, he's a capitalist pig
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:09.960]  He's a stooge, so they were totally manipulating the crowd
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:11.960]  And they would stand behind me
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:13.960]  Screaming Michelle Malkin, Michelle Malkin
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:15.960]  While I was talking with Kill Michelle Malkin
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:17.960]  And it's all in video, it's all on YouTube
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:19.960]  And it's just absolutely amazing
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:21.960]  But Michelle Malkin did say on Fox News
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:23.960]  That I did not say
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:25.960]  Kill Michelle Malkin
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:27.960]  So, you know
[3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.960]  That doesn't seem to matter to Inside Edition
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:31.960]  Or anybody else
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:33.960]  But you also tried to equate you with those people
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:35.960]  That were trying to lift the mint, too
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:37.960]  Like you were somehow at that thing
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:39.960]  Trying to lift the mint on a little television show
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:41.960]  I was there documenting how Recreate 68
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:43.960]  Does everything to make themselves look like clowns
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:45.960]  We're on record saying that
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:47.960]  And we've got them
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:49.960]  You know, they are just bumping into us
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:51.960]  Doing the rest of it
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:53.960]  I'm not putting up with crap anymore
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:55.960]  We're under attack, we're on the front lines
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:03:57.960]  We're here, I'm gonna throw it back to you
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:03:59.960]  You might play some of those audio clips again
[3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:01.960]  But this is a media war, ladies and gentlemen
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:03.960]  The true media, the true alternative media
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:05.960]  Against the establishment and their
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:07.960]  Their little doppelganger
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:09.960]  Alternative media
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:11.960]  And we can really defeat them
[3:04:11.960 --> 3:04:13.960]  On this by showing the truth
[3:04:13.960 --> 3:04:15.960]  Ralph Bader coming up in about
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:17.960]  52 minutes from now
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:19.960]  And so we hope everybody will
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:21.960]  Tune in to that right here
[3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:23.960]  On the Alex Jones Show with Jason Bermas
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:25.960]  Sitting in, God bless you
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:27.960]  And we'll be dialing in
[3:04:27.960 --> 3:04:29.960]  To the phone system at important
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:31.960]  Have you seen the remote?
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:33.960]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?

[3:05:29.960 --> 3:05:31.960]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history
[3:05:31.960 --> 3:05:35.960]  A terrorist act of war against this country
[3:05:35.960 --> 3:05:37.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[3:05:37.960 --> 3:05:39.960]  But who is the enemy?
[3:05:39.960 --> 3:05:40.960]  Bin Laden
[3:05:40.960 --> 3:05:41.960]  This is his MO
[3:05:41.960 --> 3:05:42.960]  We have to look to the Middle East
[3:05:42.960 --> 3:05:44.960]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden
[3:05:44.960 --> 3:05:47.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look
[3:05:47.960 --> 3:05:49.960]  At the terrorist ties to intelligence networks
[3:05:49.960 --> 3:05:51.960]  Inside the United States
[3:05:51.960 --> 3:05:53.960]  Some US investigators believe that
[3:05:53.960 --> 3:05:58.960]  There are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[3:05:58.960 --> 3:06:02.960]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[3:06:02.960 --> 3:06:04.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[3:06:04.960 --> 3:06:06.960]  The hijackers ties to the FBI
[3:06:06.960 --> 3:06:07.960]  The Saudi Arabian connection
[3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:09.960]  The Israeli intelligence network
[3:06:09.960 --> 3:06:10.960]  Warnings and war games
[3:06:10.960 --> 3:06:11.960]  The shadow government
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:12.960]  And much, much more

[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:01.960]  We're going to have a live interview with Ralph Nader
[3:08:01.960 --> 3:08:03.960]  I'm pretty excited about that
[3:08:03.960 --> 3:08:06.960]  The refeed at infowars.com should also be very interesting
[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:09.960]  After what Paul Craig Roberts had to say today
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:11.960]  Just shocking stuff
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:13.960]  Now we're going to go back to Mark in Oregon
[3:08:13.960 --> 3:08:16.960]  Who was saying that he feels that the Bush administration's plans
[3:08:16.960 --> 3:08:17.960]  Have gone flawlessly
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:19.960]  I'm sorry I had to cut you off there before
[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:20.960]  Go ahead, Mark
[3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:21.960]  That's no problem, Jason
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:23.960]  Hello again and by the way
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:25.960]  Thanks for the great energy that you bring to this show
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:26.960]  When Alex is dead
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:27.960]  I mean we don't miss anything
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:29.960]  And that's saying a lot when Alex is not there
[3:08:29.960 --> 3:08:30.960]  Well thanks, man
[3:08:30.960 --> 3:08:31.960]  I appreciate that
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:32.960]  Yes, sir
[3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:34.960]  Jason, as I was saying
[3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:37.960]  I've been watching this administration for seven plus years
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:39.960]  And very closely
[3:08:39.960 --> 3:08:41.960]  And I have not seen them fail
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:43.960]  In one point of their agenda
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:46.960]  Either domestically or internationally
[3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:48.960]  And I believe that their agenda
[3:08:48.960 --> 3:08:51.960]  Has predominantly been to affect this country
[3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:52.960]  To make this country
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:08:54.960]  And everything that they've done
[3:08:54.960 --> 3:08:56.960]  To make this country look
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:08:59.960]  As the evil doer in the eyes of the world
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:01.960]  In the eyes of the people of the world
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:03.960]  Outside of this country
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:04.960]  No, I felt that way too
[3:09:04.960 --> 3:09:06.960]  And I'm going to let you continue
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:08.960]  But I've always felt that's why
[3:09:08.960 --> 3:09:10.960]  Today's conversation with Paul Craig Roberts
[3:09:10.960 --> 3:09:11.960]  Was so shocking to me
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:12.960]  I've always felt like
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:14.960]  They want to make us into the new Nazi Germany
[3:09:14.960 --> 3:09:17.960]  And eventually all this stuff will come out
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:18.960]  9-11, Iraq, Iran
[3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:22.960]  And they will call for a new international tribunal
[3:09:22.960 --> 3:09:24.960]  That needs to head these things up
[3:09:24.960 --> 3:09:25.960]  And take over
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:27.960]  And we'll lose all of our military power
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:29.960]  All of our sovereignty, our constitution
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:31.960]  Our bill of rights
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:33.960]  I mean, that's how I've seen it going
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:35.960]  Paul Craig Roberts seems to disagree
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:37.960]  He thinks we're on the verge of nuclear warfare
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:09:38.960]  Who knows, continue
[3:09:38.960 --> 3:09:40.960]  Yes, and what you have here
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:43.960]  Is a premise that they have laid out for themselves
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:46.960]  I think from ancient times, essentially
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:49.960]  And that has to do with the Phoenician myth
[3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:52.960]  The phoenix who was reborn from the flames
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:56.960]  Of its demise and crash into the earth
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:09:58.960]  And out of this country's destruction
[3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:00.960]  Will be born the true phoenix
[3:10:00.960 --> 3:10:02.960]  Which is the New World Order
[3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:04.960]  And it can only be done
[3:10:04.960 --> 3:10:06.960]  By the way that they've set their agenda up
[3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:08.960]  By destroying America
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:12.960]  America is fitted into the whole agenda
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:15.960]  As it stands at this current time
[3:10:15.960 --> 3:10:17.960]  And as it's been laid out over the last century
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:20.960]  As so in detail, ever since Albert Pike
[3:10:20.960 --> 3:10:23.960]  Said that there would be three world wars
[3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:25.960]  And that the last war would be between
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:29.960]  The Muslim religion and the Christian religion
[3:10:29.960 --> 3:10:32.960]  Basically, I think of the Muslim and the Jewish religion
[3:10:32.960 --> 3:10:35.960]  So that you actually have things being laid out
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:37.960]  So far ahead of time
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:40.960]  And that the United States plays such a pivotal role
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:43.960]  To its own great loss, to its own destruction
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:45.960]  And that everything that's being done in Russia
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:47.960]  Is now that you're concerned about
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:49.960]  People name this every day
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:53.960]  As being in the Bible, in the old and the New Testament
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:55.960]  And when one looks into the Bible
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:10:57.960]  From the Christian perspective
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:11:00.960]  It can very easily be seen
[3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:03.960]  That this country is actually the Babylon
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:05.960]  Babylon the Great
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:07.960]  Who deceived the nations
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:09.960]  That's mentioned in revelations
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:11.960]  It sure seems that way, doesn't it?
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:13.960]  It seems like we are at the top of the pyramid
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:16.960]  More decadent than ever in this country
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:19.960]  With things like the iPhone, Britney Spears
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:21.960]  MTV 1 through 46
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:23.960]  I mean, how many networks does MTV really need, folks?
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:25.960]  I thank you for the call mark
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:28.960]  You know, I think we've fallen greatly in this country
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:30.960]  From not only our morality
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:32.960]  But our general humanity
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:34.960]  Our love for our fellow man
[3:11:34.960 --> 3:11:36.960]  Our caring for our neighbor, it's gone
[3:11:36.960 --> 3:11:38.960]  You know, most people are in this
[3:11:38.960 --> 3:11:40.960]  Go get a attitude, I'm out for me
[3:11:40.960 --> 3:11:42.960]  I'm more concerned about my job
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:44.960]  My car, how cool I look
[3:11:44.960 --> 3:11:46.960]  You know, am I fashionable?
[3:11:46.960 --> 3:11:48.960]  You know, can I afford this thing?
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:50.960]  Meanwhile, banks are failing
[3:11:50.960 --> 3:11:52.960]  Houses are being taken
[3:11:52.960 --> 3:11:54.960]  You know, our dollars being devalued
[3:11:54.960 --> 3:11:56.960]  On a whole separate level
[3:11:56.960 --> 3:11:59.960]  So, you know, I'm not one of these prophecy guys
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:01.960]  I don't talk about the Bible prophecies
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:03.960]  I don't talk about Nostradamus
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:05.960]  I don't even talk about...
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:07.960]  You know, I talk about people within the last 100
[3:12:07.960 --> 3:12:09.960]  Maybe even 200 years that have put it down on paper
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:11.960]  As a social prediction, you know
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:13.960]  But as far as biblical prophecy
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:15.960]  I tend to stay away from that stuff
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:17.960]  Although it is very, very interesting
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:19.960]  You know, not only Bible prophecy have I watched
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:21.960]  But Jordan Maxwell's material is great
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:23.960]  I'm a big fan of Anthony J. Hilder
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:25.960]  All these great grandeurities
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:27.960]  Of the New World Order
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:29.960]  Or anti-New World Order movement, I should say
[3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:31.960]  I have some great, great info
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:34.960]  Before we jump to Rick in Texas
[3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:36.960]  I want to play my second trailer
[3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:38.960]  For fabled enemies
[3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:40.960]  It drops August 31st
[3:12:40.960 --> 3:12:41.960]  On DVD September 1st
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:42.960]  That's when we're shipping them out
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:44.960]  So order them now so we can get them out the door
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:46.960]  And I'm stoked about this film
[3:12:46.960 --> 3:12:48.960]  It goes over the intelligence ties
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:50.960]  Of the hijackers of bin Laden
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:52.960]  The continuity of government program
[3:12:52.960 --> 3:12:54.960]  The Israeli operatives that were detained that day
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:57.960]  And much, much more including the anthrax attacks
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:12:58.960]  So take it away
[3:12:58.960 --> 3:13:00.960]  Fox News has learned that some American
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:02.960]  Terrorism investigators fear
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:05.960]  Certain suspects in the September 11th attacks
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.960]  May have managed to stay ahead of them
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:09.960]  Some US investigators believe
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:12.960]  That they're Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:14.960]  In and on the US
[3:13:14.960 --> 3:13:16.960]  Whether it's because they're in intelligence services
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:18.960]  Or what they were doing
[3:13:18.960 --> 3:13:20.960]  I will defer to the Department of Justice
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:21.960]  And the FBI
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:24.960]  That there was a report on the George Washington bridge
[3:13:24.960 --> 3:13:25.960]  That there had been a van
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:28.960]  Stopped there that had explosives
[3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:30.960]  We have a suspect who lives
[3:13:30.960 --> 3:13:32.960]  Of those that had exploded
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:35.960]  MDocs Limited
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:38.960]  An Israeli based private telecommunications company
[3:13:38.960 --> 3:13:41.960]  It is virtually impossible to make a call
[3:13:41.960 --> 3:13:42.960]  On normal phones
[3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:45.960]  Without generating an MDocs record of it
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:47.960]  It quickly unraveled to be the largest
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:49.960]  Foreign spying ever uncovered
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:51.960]  Inside the United States
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:52.960]  The largest
[3:13:52.960 --> 3:13:53.960]  Documents say they quote
[3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:56.960]  Targeted and penetrated military bases
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:13:58.960]  The DEA, FBI
[3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:00.960]  And dozens of other government facilities
[3:14:00.960 --> 3:14:03.960]  There's one big elephant in the living room
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:05.960]  There's the relationship between
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:08.960]  The United States of America and the state of Israel
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:11.960]  What about this question of advanced knowledge
[3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:13.960]  Of what was going to happen on 9-11?
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:15.960]  Well it's very explosive information obviously
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:16.960]  A bigger question they say is
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:18.960]  How could they not have known?
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:23.960]  Fabled enemies August 31st on PrismPlanet.tv
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:25.960]  Shipping the DVDs September 1st
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:28.960]  Very, very excited about that release
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:30.960]  Remember if you want to see it on a big screen
[3:14:30.960 --> 3:14:31.960]  Come down to New York City
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:32.960]  Meet myself, meet Alex Jones
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:33.960]  We're going to be playing that
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:35.960]  And 9-11 Chronicles Truth Rising
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:37.960]  Another great DVD that's available
[3:14:37.960 --> 3:14:39.960]  At the Infowars.com shop
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:40.960]  Just a ton of stuff
[3:14:40.960 --> 3:14:42.960]  American drug war we touched on
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:44.960]  How we've run drugs in this country
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:47.960]  I mean there's just so much information
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:50.960]  That you can get by becoming a PrismPlanet.tv
[3:14:50.960 --> 3:14:52.960]  Subscriber or ordering these DVDs
[3:14:52.960 --> 3:14:55.960]  From Alex Jones himself at the Infowars shop
[3:14:55.960 --> 3:14:56.960]  Alright let's take a few more callers
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:58.960]  Let's go to Rick in Texas
[3:14:58.960 --> 3:14:59.960]  Rick what's on your mind?
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:01.960]  Hi Jason
[3:15:01.960 --> 3:15:03.960]  First I want to say thank you
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:07.960]  Because you participated in the Loose Change
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:08.960]  The second edition
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:09.960]  That's what woke me up
[3:15:09.960 --> 3:15:11.960]  A couple of years ago
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:14.960]  And I wanted to call in
[3:15:14.960 --> 3:15:19.960]  Because Bob Chapman made a very important
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:22.960]  Statement when he said that
[3:15:22.960 --> 3:15:24.960]  One of the biggest things we could do
[3:15:24.960 --> 3:15:26.960]  Would be to fire all of Congress
[3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:29.960]  I am one of the national organizers
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:34.960]  And founders of FireCongress.meetup.com
[3:15:34.960 --> 3:15:36.960]  And we're not making any money on this
[3:15:36.960 --> 3:15:38.960]  But we want to kick every one of the incumbents out
[3:15:38.960 --> 3:15:40.960]  As many as possible
[3:15:40.960 --> 3:15:42.960]  Our goal is to kick them all out
[3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:44.960]  Except for Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich
[3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:47.960]  And I would encourage everybody to check us out
[3:15:47.960 --> 3:15:48.960]  No that's not right
[3:15:48.960 --> 3:15:49.960]  I said that's about right
[3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:50.960]  Those are about the two guys
[3:15:50.960 --> 3:15:51.960]  That I think I might keep in Congress
[3:15:51.960 --> 3:15:53.960]  So give out that site one more time
[3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:56.960]  FireCongress.meetup.com
[3:15:56.960 --> 3:15:59.960]  And also you can read about our plan
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:02.960]  At FireCongress.org
[3:16:02.960 --> 3:16:04.960]  Alright man, thank you so much for the call
[3:16:04.960 --> 3:16:05.960]  I believe that as well
[3:16:05.960 --> 3:16:07.960]  We need to get rid of Congress
[3:16:07.960 --> 3:16:11.960]  Kucinich and Ron Paul seem to be the only two guys
[3:16:11.960 --> 3:16:13.960]  That are standing up for the Constitution
[3:16:13.960 --> 3:16:14.960]  The Bill of Rights
[3:16:14.960 --> 3:16:16.960]  So I'm with you there my friend
[3:16:16.960 --> 3:16:18.960]  Alright let's jump to Steve in Canada
[3:16:18.960 --> 3:16:21.960]  Steve what's on your mind
[3:16:21.960 --> 3:16:22.960]  You there Steve
[3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:23.960]  Yes I am, sorry about that
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:24.960]  That's alright
[3:16:24.960 --> 3:16:26.960]  The reason I'm calling is
[3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:29.960]  I was escaping reality
[3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:31.960]  For a little bit about ten days ago
[3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:32.960]  Watching a football game
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:34.960]  We have a professional football league
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:35.960]  Up here in Canada
[3:16:35.960 --> 3:16:37.960]  It's a CFL
[3:16:37.960 --> 3:16:39.960]  Watching the Toronto Argonauts
[3:16:39.960 --> 3:16:42.960]  And one of their offensive linemen
[3:16:42.960 --> 3:16:45.960]  Ross Weaver all of a sudden
[3:16:45.960 --> 3:16:48.960]  Is being recalled by the
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:50.960]  Air Force
[3:16:50.960 --> 3:16:51.960]  Sorry
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:54.960]  And yeah so they had to let him out of his contract
[3:16:54.960 --> 3:16:57.960]  He's a missile combat crew commander
[3:16:57.960 --> 3:17:01.960]  I forget what state he's out of
[3:17:01.960 --> 3:17:04.960]  Yeah he handles security
[3:17:04.960 --> 3:17:06.960]  For the nuclear missile base
[3:17:06.960 --> 3:17:07.960]  In the state that he was in
[3:17:07.960 --> 3:17:11.960]  And they did an emergency recall
[3:17:11.960 --> 3:17:13.960]  On August the 12th
[3:17:13.960 --> 3:17:15.960]  And just so people know
[3:17:15.960 --> 3:17:17.960]  Most of the professional Canadian football players
[3:17:17.960 --> 3:17:19.960]  Are cropped out of the United States
[3:17:19.960 --> 3:17:21.960]  You know people that were drafted
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:23.960]  Third round didn't end up being caught
[3:17:23.960 --> 3:17:25.960]  And I remember when Doug Flutie went over
[3:17:25.960 --> 3:17:27.960]  I think it was to the Toronto Argonauts
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:28.960]  That's right
[3:17:28.960 --> 3:17:29.960]  In the day
[3:17:29.960 --> 3:17:31.960]  And that's what kind of launched the CFL
[3:17:31.960 --> 3:17:32.960]  And there was another big running back
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:33.960]  That never really amounted to anything
[3:17:33.960 --> 3:17:34.960]  That went there too
[3:17:34.960 --> 3:17:36.960]  Ricky Williams went there a couple years ago
[3:17:36.960 --> 3:17:37.960]  That's right
[3:17:37.960 --> 3:17:39.960]  I'm talking like 15 years ago
[3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:42.960]  We've had a number of amazing players
[3:17:42.960 --> 3:17:44.960]  That actually started
[3:17:44.960 --> 3:17:47.960]  I mean Jeff Garcia won CFL championship
[3:17:47.960 --> 3:17:50.960]  Twice in Calgary before going to the NFL
[3:17:50.960 --> 3:17:52.960]  So for them to pull these guys
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:54.960]  They're making some decent scratch
[3:17:54.960 --> 3:17:55.960]  I mean they're not lavished
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:17:57.960]  Quite as much as an NFL player
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:00.960]  But for him to be pulled to go do military service
[3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:02.960]  Means that something could be up
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:03.960]  I thank you for the call Steve
[3:18:03.960 --> 3:18:04.960]  That is interesting
[3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:06.960]  And let us talk about football for two minutes
[3:18:06.960 --> 3:18:08.960]  On the Alex Jones show
[3:18:08.960 --> 3:18:10.960]  Almost unheard of
[3:18:10.960 --> 3:18:12.960]  All right let us jump to
[3:18:12.960 --> 3:18:14.960]  I think it's Bruce in Connecticut
[3:18:14.960 --> 3:18:15.960]  What's on your mind Bruce
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:16.960]  Hey how's it going
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:17.960]  Good man
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:20.960]  Thanks to all you guys for putting out the word
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:21.960]  A few things
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:22.960]  I'm 48
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:24.960]  I remember back in the Kent days
[3:18:24.960 --> 3:18:26.960]  And they had all that shit going on
[3:18:26.960 --> 3:18:27.960]  With the
[3:18:27.960 --> 3:18:28.960]  I gotta drop you dude
[3:18:28.960 --> 3:18:29.960]  You gotta watch your language
[3:18:29.960 --> 3:18:30.960]  You're on the show man
[3:18:30.960 --> 3:18:31.960]  I'm sorry
[3:18:31.960 --> 3:18:34.960]  Maybe I was talking about Kent State
[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:37.960]  And the students that were shot there
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:39.960]  No excuses really there
[3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:42.960]  Just the military began firing on students
[3:18:42.960 --> 3:18:44.960]  When they were peacefully protesting
[3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:47.960]  An interesting point that I did want to make
[3:18:47.960 --> 3:18:50.960]  Was that Michael Rivera was pretty spot on
[3:18:50.960 --> 3:18:51.960]  In yesterday's broadcast
[3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:53.960]  When he talked about Recreate 68
[3:18:53.960 --> 3:18:55.960]  And the original 68
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:18:57.960]  Actually being funded
[3:18:57.960 --> 3:19:00.960]  And provocatored by agencies
[3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:01.960]  Within the United States
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:02.960]  The FBI and CIA
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:03.960]  Big shocker there
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:05.960]  They incited the riots
[3:19:05.960 --> 3:19:06.960]  All right
[3:19:06.960 --> 3:19:07.960]  They would have loved to incite riots
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:09.960]  This time but we exposed them
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:10.960]  So what do they do
[3:19:10.960 --> 3:19:11.960]  They do the next best thing
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:12.960]  They dress everybody up
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:14.960]  Goofy magicians outfit
[3:19:14.960 --> 3:19:16.960]  Mickey Mouse and Fantasia of course
[3:19:16.960 --> 3:19:18.960]  And say they're going to levitate the mint
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:20.960]  I don't want to be associated with those people
[3:19:20.960 --> 3:19:21.960]  And I know you don't either
[3:19:21.960 --> 3:19:43.960]  Goofy magicians outfit
[3:19:43.960 --> 3:19:52.960]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S. Hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. Treasuries
[3:19:52.960 --> 3:19:54.960]  Responding to Washington's trade sanctions
[3:19:54.960 --> 3:19:56.960]  Forcing the Yon Revolution
[3:19:56.960 --> 3:20:01.960]  Communist party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon
[3:20:01.960 --> 3:20:04.960]  Causing bond yields to spike hammering the U.S. housing market
[3:20:04.960 --> 3:20:06.960]  And throwing the economy into a recession
[3:20:06.960 --> 3:20:10.960]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat
[3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:13.960]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report
[3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:16.960]  China threatens nuclear option of dollar sales
[3:20:16.960 --> 3:20:18.960]  Call for the report today
[3:20:18.960 --> 3:20:20.960]  800-686-2237
[3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:23.960]  The value of your hard earned money is being lost in the global game of chess

[3:20:25.960 --> 3:20:28.960]  That's 800-686-2237
[3:20:28.960 --> 3:20:30.960]  May I have everybody's attention please
[3:20:30.960 --> 3:20:33.960]  I've come with a message of information
[3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:35.960]  9-11 was an inside job
[3:20:35.960 --> 3:20:37.960]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:38.960]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:20:38.960 --> 3:20:41.960]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:42.960]  Was it engineered by you?
[3:20:42.960 --> 3:20:45.960]  David Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR
[3:20:45.960 --> 3:20:47.960]  We sit down and shout out
[3:20:47.960 --> 3:20:54.960]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:57.960]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11
[3:20:57.960 --> 3:21:00.960]  A global awakening has taken place
[3:21:00.960 --> 3:21:02.960]  An inside job?
[3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:04.960]  How dare you?
[3:21:04.960 --> 3:21:07.960]  I don't want to keep looking at how they're suggesting that you're a 9-11
[3:21:07.960 --> 3:21:09.960]  If you know that there's treason going on
[3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:11.960]  You can be held accountable for treason yourself
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:14.960]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:16.960]  And if the government has not told the truth
[3:21:16.960 --> 3:21:19.960]  In five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:20.960]  Please rise

[3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:01.960]  Remember you can see live video feeds from the DNC right now at infowars.com
[3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:04.960]  It should be very, very lively
[3:24:04.960 --> 3:24:10.960]  Ralph Nader will be joining us via justin.tv at infowars.com
[3:24:10.960 --> 3:24:14.960]  Or over the cell line with Alex Jones, it should be very interesting
[3:24:14.960 --> 3:24:20.960]  You've shown the clip of Malcolm trying to associate Jones with these idiot left-wingers
[3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:25.960]  Who think that they're going to magically raise the mint and they're going to dress in capes and little hats
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:28.960]  And have magic wands, excellent
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:34.960]  Well not really, actually if you're trying to influence people or show that you have some kind of credibility
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:37.960]  Or you have some kind of a plan or a reason for being there
[3:24:37.960 --> 3:24:41.960]  No, you're just going to get in a robe and act like an idiot
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:44.960]  Alright, we're going to continue to take your calls in this hour
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:46.960]  Let's go to Mary in Florida
[3:24:46.960 --> 3:24:48.960]  Mary, what's on your mind?
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:54.960]  Thank you for bringing up that topic too, because that's exactly what I wanted to talk about
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:57.960]  I think everybody should call Inside Edition
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:25:02.960]  And it's the numbers 212-817-5555
[3:25:02.960 --> 3:25:06.960]  And tell them that they should not spin the story about what happened with Malcolm
[3:25:06.960 --> 3:25:11.960]  They should tell the truth that Jones did not say kill Malcolm
[3:25:11.960 --> 3:25:16.960]  That there's video evidence that those were provocateurs doing that
[3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:20.960]  Because there is evidence that he did not say that
[3:25:20.960 --> 3:25:24.960]  And they're not going to get away with spinning a story, and I think we should tell them that
[3:25:24.960 --> 3:25:29.960]  Excellent, I think that we not only need to do that, but we need to bombard Fox Radio
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:35.960]  A lot of people don't know, but Handity's got his own show, Riley's got his own show, Gibson's got his own show
[3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:37.960]  And you've got to get past the screeners
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:41.960]  We don't screen calls on this show, but they often screen calls on that show
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:47.960]  So act like you're sympathetic towards John McCain or their position until you get on the air
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:49.960]  And then you tell the truth until they catch you off
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:51.960]  I feel like you're a new con
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:57.960]  Obviously, I feel like you're a new con Nazi, and then go all infowars on them
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:25:59.960]  Exactly, exactly
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:05.960]  Alex Jones does, and he did so well at the DNC yesterday in front of MSNBC for 20 minutes
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:08.960]  He took over the show, talked about 9-11 being an inside job
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:14.960]  That message, it's like when your fire alarm goes off, only you can't take out the battery
[3:26:14.960 --> 3:26:17.960]  You just got to keep hearing the message, and he got his website out
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:20.960]  I love Alex Jones' tactics, thank you for the call, Mary
[3:26:20.960 --> 3:26:24.960]  Alright, lest we be accused of not taking every call
[3:26:24.960 --> 3:26:27.960]  I have somebody on the line
[3:26:27.960 --> 3:26:30.960]  Jim is calling himself Jim from Planet Zorbia
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:32.960]  Jim, what's on your mind?
[3:26:32.960 --> 3:26:37.960]  My parents woke me up in 65, I don't bore you with everything, but I've been watching this ever since
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:43.960]  The New World Order is very old, and they tailor made their takeovers to every era country in the economy
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:47.960]  And I have proof, and you can verify our yuppies are next
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:50.960]  Jason, why did Hitler go after the Jews?
[3:26:50.960 --> 3:26:54.960]  I think it was because they were an easy target for the rest of the population to go after
[3:26:54.960 --> 3:26:56.960]  And he was able to take their wealth at the same time
[3:26:56.960 --> 3:27:01.960]  Yeah, it was the money, he started by rounding up the fringes groups, then went on to the jackpots, the Jews, and the factory owners
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:07.960]  Two years ago, my property was attacked, and I found in writing in plain sight the American equivalent of Hitler's attack on the Jews
[3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:09.960]  Are you ready for a four-minute shock treatment?
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:10.960]  Let's hear it
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:14.960]  In wealth economies, a skill-motivated, innovative middle-class people create the most wealth
[3:27:14.960 --> 3:27:15.960]  Elite is steel wealth
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:18.960]  Have you heard of the International Property Maintenance Code?
[3:27:18.960 --> 3:27:19.960]  I have not
[3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:23.960]  Okay, and this will sound unbelievable, but it's true, very intense and very important
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:25.960]  Let me go all the way to the kicker
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:26.960]  Okay
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:30.960]  Any jurisdiction anywhere in the world can adopt this code and enforce it as if it's legitimate
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:33.960]  Some do it with an administrative decree
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:38.960]  Put international property maintenance code in quotes
[3:27:38.960 --> 3:27:42.960]  Do a search, download the free 2003 version in PDF format
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:46.960]  It is infinitely worse than eminent domain, it costs money to do the eminent domain trick
[3:27:46.960 --> 3:27:52.960]  It is extremely lucrative to steal property with the IPMC, and it's happening all over America right now
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:55.960]  I did a program with Derry Brownfield on it one hour, two years ago
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:27:56.960]  Okay, one with Pastor Butch, the politician
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:27:57.960]  Here it is
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:00.960]  The code official is a sole interpreter of the code
[3:28:00.960 --> 3:28:02.960]  Forget the process, there isn't any
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:07.960]  He is an investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, executioner, the sole interpreter
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:10.960]  All right, so give out this code again, really slow, because you're a fast talker
[3:28:10.960 --> 3:28:12.960]  I thank you for the information
[3:28:12.960 --> 3:28:16.960]  That's all right, man, I just want my listeners to be able to go check out this code themselves
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:18.960]  Just give out the code one more time for us
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:20.960]  Yes, I'll give you the website later
[3:28:20.960 --> 3:28:25.960]  The international property maintenance code, get the 2003 version
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:28.960]  The international property maintenance code in quotes
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:30.960]  And I'll give you a little more later
[3:28:30.960 --> 3:28:31.960]  Okay, now here's a killer
[3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:33.960]  Every infraction is several killers here
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:34.960]  Let me go to the keyer
[3:28:34.960 --> 3:28:38.960]  Every infraction is a mandatory misdemeanor, usually in terms of hundreds of dollars
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:40.960]  And or a month in jail per infraction
[3:28:40.960 --> 3:28:43.960]  Every day the infraction occurs as a separate offense
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:45.960]  Anything the code official says is not in good working order
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:51.960]  Example, sticky window, loose door, torn window screen, dented gutter, anything he says is not in good working order
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:53.960]  Every day it exists, separate mandatory misdemeanor
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:55.960]  All right, I got to cut you off there
[3:28:55.960 --> 3:28:56.960]  I thank you for the call, Jim
[3:28:56.960 --> 3:28:57.960]  I hope people go check that out
[3:28:57.960 --> 3:29:00.960]  We're going to be taking your calls in the next half hour
[3:29:00.960 --> 3:29:18.960]  And then in overdrive Ralph Nader, only at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:22.960]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[3:29:22.960 --> 3:29:28.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:35.960]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country
[3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:37.960]  The enemy struck America on September 11th
[3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:39.960]  But who is the enemy?
[3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:40.960]  bin Laden
[3:29:40.960 --> 3:29:41.960]  This is his MO
[3:29:41.960 --> 3:29:42.960]  We have to look to the Middle East
[3:29:42.960 --> 3:29:44.960]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:51.960]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[3:29:51.960 --> 3:29:58.960]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US
[3:29:58.960 --> 3:30:02.960]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[3:30:02.960 --> 3:30:09.960]  Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network
[3:30:09.960 --> 3:30:12.960]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more
[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:13.960]  Fabled Enemies

[3:30:28.960 --> 3:30:31.960]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:30:31.960 --> 3:30:34.960]  First, I get the best parking space at work
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:37.960]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[3:30:37.960 --> 3:30:40.960]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney
[3:30:40.960 --> 3:30:44.960]  Finalized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston
[3:30:44.960 --> 3:30:47.960]  Online from my desk with WebEx
[3:30:47.960 --> 3:30:50.960]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk
[3:30:50.960 --> 3:30:52.960]  I just talked to clients on the phone

[3:30:55.960 --> 3:30:59.960]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel
[3:30:59.960 --> 3:31:01.960]  Travel less, meet online

[3:32:35.960 --> 3:32:37.960]  The information war continues
[3:32:37.960 --> 3:32:41.960]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[3:32:46.960 --> 3:32:48.960]  Alright, a little barracuda
[3:32:48.960 --> 3:32:50.960]  To bring it up, it's the Alex Jones Show
[3:32:50.960 --> 3:32:52.960]  I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex
[3:32:52.960 --> 3:32:54.960]  Throughout the week, and remember Friday
[3:32:54.960 --> 3:32:56.960]  We're going to be doing the best of
[3:32:56.960 --> 3:32:58.960]  And on top of just the best of
[3:32:58.960 --> 3:33:00.960]  We're also going to be playing some clips that we didn't play
[3:33:00.960 --> 3:33:02.960]  During the week that were streamed live
[3:33:02.960 --> 3:33:04.960]  Over at infowars.com
[3:33:04.960 --> 3:33:06.960]  Through the great service of Justin.TV

[3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:24.960]  And Alex just keeps on expanding
[3:33:24.960 --> 3:33:26.960]  He's working on a new television network
[3:33:26.960 --> 3:33:28.960]  I very much want to be a part of that
[3:33:28.960 --> 3:33:30.960]  I want to be a part of this info war
[3:33:30.960 --> 3:33:32.960]  I want to do the right thing
[3:33:32.960 --> 3:33:34.960]  I want to try to help humanity
[3:33:34.960 --> 3:33:36.960]  I want to try to build this country
[3:33:36.960 --> 3:33:38.960]  Back up based on its constitutional principles
[3:33:38.960 --> 3:33:40.960]  Does that make me a far leftist
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:42.960]  Or a right wing radical?
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:44.960]  No!
[3:33:44.960 --> 3:33:46.960]  It makes me somebody who believes in this country
[3:33:46.960 --> 3:33:48.960]  Who believes in the Constitution
[3:33:48.960 --> 3:33:50.960]  And balances in a system
[3:33:50.960 --> 3:33:52.960]  Where one cannot just declare something
[3:33:52.960 --> 3:33:54.960]  And put it into law
[3:33:54.960 --> 3:33:56.960]  One person can't say
[3:33:56.960 --> 3:33:58.960]  I own that
[3:33:58.960 --> 3:34:00.960]  It's mine
[3:34:00.960 --> 3:34:02.960]  I'll do what I want, but really
[3:34:02.960 --> 3:34:04.960]  That's a lot like what we have
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:06.960]  I mean, even people that try to
[3:34:06.960 --> 3:34:08.960]  Fight
[3:34:08.960 --> 3:34:10.960]  If you will, fight the system
[3:34:10.960 --> 3:34:12.960]  And say, I'm not going to give up my farm
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:14.960]  For the trans-Texas corridor
[3:34:14.960 --> 3:34:16.960]  Well, they often lose and then they're sued for it
[3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:18.960]  And not only do they not take the unfair amount
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:20.960]  That's offered by the government
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:22.960]  Usually between one third
[3:34:22.960 --> 3:34:24.960]  And one tenth of the actual value
[3:34:24.960 --> 3:34:26.960]  Is what's offered, and then if you don't take that
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:28.960]  No, we're going to sue you
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:30.960]  And we're just going to take it anyway
[3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:32.960]  That should not be allowed
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:34.960]  That's what we've slipped into in this country
[3:34:34.960 --> 3:34:36.960]  I don't know much about this code
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:38.960]  That the last caller was talking about
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:40.960]  But if it's what I think it is
[3:34:40.960 --> 3:34:42.960]  It could be something as simple as
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:44.960]  You have some lawn furniture that's against code
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:46.960]  And every day that you have that out there
[3:34:46.960 --> 3:34:48.960]  It would be a separate fine of about $300
[3:34:48.960 --> 3:34:51.960]  So in a week you could rack up a $2,100 bill
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:53.960]  And one of the easiest ways
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:55.960]  For the elitist to control us
[3:34:55.960 --> 3:34:57.960]  Is to control our monetary funds
[3:34:57.960 --> 3:34:59.960]  You know, it basically controls
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:01.960]  What kind of goods and services we can buy
[3:35:01.960 --> 3:35:03.960]  And what our standard of living will be
[3:35:03.960 --> 3:35:05.960]  Alright, let's continue on with callers
[3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:07.960]  We're going to shoot through them
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:08.960]  Let's go to Brian in Florida
[3:35:08.960 --> 3:35:10.960]  Brian, what's on your mind?
[3:35:10.960 --> 3:35:12.960]  Hey, Jason, first of all, I want to thank you
[3:35:12.960 --> 3:35:14.960]  As well, whether you work with Loose Change
[3:35:14.960 --> 3:35:16.960]  You were instrumental in opening my eyes
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:17.960]  To a lot of things
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:18.960]  Well, thank you
[3:35:18.960 --> 3:35:19.960]  So I thank you very much for that
[3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:22.960]  Listen, Jason, I'm watching TV right now
[3:35:22.960 --> 3:35:24.960]  And I'm watching The Hunt for Red October
[3:35:24.960 --> 3:35:27.960]  And I noticed it had been on quite a few times recently
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:29.960]  So in light of everything that's going on
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:31.960]  Your conversation with Paul Craig Roberts
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:34.960]  I did a little quick search on my digital system
[3:35:34.960 --> 3:35:37.960]  And found 74 different entries
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:39.960]  With programs pertaining to Russia
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:41.960]  That are on right now or in the coming days
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:43.960]  Some of them are duplicate entries
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:45.960]  But I'd be curious to know viewers
[3:35:45.960 --> 3:35:49.960]  No, it doesn't seem like it's a coincidence, does it?
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:52.960]  And I've been seeing The Hunt for Red October
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:54.960]  On things like the History Channel lately
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:35:55.960]  Is that what it's on?
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:57.960]  It's on AMC right now
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:36:00.960]  I'd be curious who's watching Red Dawn
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:01.960]  On television these days
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:03.960]  Or Firefox or anything else like that
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:05.960]  And how many times are being played
[3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:07.960]  And what kind of programs specifically about Russia
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:10.960]  Are being played on local cable stations across the country
[3:36:10.960 --> 3:36:12.960]  Yeah, I would assume that this is the time
[3:36:12.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  To gear it up
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:15.960]  I mean, we know after 9-11
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:17.960]  They took some of the most famous songs
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:19.960]  Including John Lennon's Imagine
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:20.960]  Off the Air
[3:36:20.960 --> 3:36:22.960]  Because they didn't want people to think about that
[3:36:22.960 --> 3:36:24.960]  And you better believe
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:26.960]  That they put this kind of propaganda out there
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:28.960]  I'm not sure, but I think The Hunt for Red October
[3:36:28.960 --> 3:36:29.960]  Is a Tom Clancy novel
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:30.960]  No, I'm sure of it
[3:36:30.960 --> 3:36:32.960]  It is a Tom Clancy novel
[3:36:32.960 --> 3:36:34.960]  Because it involves Jack Ryan
[3:36:34.960 --> 3:36:37.960]  Before he becomes president in this whole series of novels
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:40.960]  But really what disturbs me about Clancy
[3:36:40.960 --> 3:36:43.960]  Is that he does seem to be some sort of a profit
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:45.960]  Now do I think that Clancy's in on it?
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:49.960]  No, I think that Clancy talks to a lot of intelligence officials
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:51.960]  Obviously he writes these books
[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:53.960]  So he has a pretty good understanding
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:55.960]  Of the military-industrial complex
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:36:57.960]  And that's why in 2001
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:36:59.960]  When they put out the original Ghost Recon
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:03.960]  They were able to predict that Georgia, South Ossetia, and Russia
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:06.960]  Were going to have a conflict in April of 2008
[3:37:06.960 --> 3:37:09.960]  And it was going to be the complete restructuring of Russia
[3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:11.960]  Now when I got this email
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:13.960]  I said, no way
[3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:15.960]  No way that this game came out seven years ago
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:17.960]  And that it takes place in 2008
[3:37:17.960 --> 3:37:19.960]  And it mirrors the conflict that's going on
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:22.960]  Also that that conflict was initiated
[3:37:22.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  With U.S. Special Forces going to aid Georgia
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:27.960]  You know, it's just unbelievable
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:28.960]  But it happened, you know
[3:37:28.960 --> 3:37:31.960]  And this is the same guy who before 9-11
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:33.960]  Wrote about a commercial airliner
[3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:36.960]  Hitting the Capitol and decapitating Congress
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:38.960]  And then literally within the year
[3:37:38.960 --> 3:37:40.960]  We have commercial airliners hitting buildings
[3:37:40.960 --> 3:37:44.960]  So, you know, Clancy himself is an interesting subject
[3:37:44.960 --> 3:37:45.960]  I wish we could get him on the show
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:46.960]  I thank you for the call, Brian
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:48.960]  And I'm interested also to know
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:50.960]  You know, who's putting this programming out there
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  And are we putting it out there now
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:55.960]  To try to demonize Russia yet again
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:57.960]  To make them, you know, the enemy
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:37:59.960]  The Red Scare is back
[3:37:59.960 --> 3:38:00.960]  It's very possible
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:03.960]  I think it's going to be tougher to sell that Red Scare though
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:07.960]  Seeing as we just had the Olympics in Beijing, China
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:09.960]  And we're trying to act like China's a great nation
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:13.960]  That's a pretty hard act to follow
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:16.960]  Peggy in Pennsylvania, what is on your mind, Peggy?
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:19.960]  I need to say a word in defense of the sheeple
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:22.960]  I'm not trying to insult either you or Alex
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:24.960]  Or anybody on the show
[3:38:24.960 --> 3:38:28.960]  But, you know, there's been references to the people
[3:38:28.960 --> 3:38:32.960]  Calling them the common people of the US, the sheeple
[3:38:32.960 --> 3:38:36.960]  And how they're so stupid and all these things
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:39.960]  And what I think Alex may not concentrate on
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:42.960]  Is the fact that...
[3:38:42.960 --> 3:38:45.960]  And various writers have commented on this
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:46.960]  In anthropology and so on
[3:38:46.960 --> 3:38:49.960]  That there's basically two types of people
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:51.960]  And they fall into general groups
[3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:55.960]  One is the people that would be the neocons
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:38:58.960]  And their mindset, evil or not
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:02.960]  They're very aggressive and masculine-centered
[3:39:02.960 --> 3:39:04.960]  Even the things they're into
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:07.960]  Type A personality as opposed to a type B
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:10.960]  What I'm talking about is the things that they go for
[3:39:10.960 --> 3:39:13.960]  They're usually successful in civilized society
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:16.960]  The real go-getters, the doers and shakers
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:18.960]  And then there's the average person
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:20.960]  Who can be very, very intelligent
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:22.960]  And still not be, quote, successful
[3:39:22.960 --> 3:39:24.960]  And the majority of the people in the world
[3:39:24.960 --> 3:39:26.960]  Are the second type
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:28.960]  And if these people are not understood
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:31.960]  By people who are very aggressive like Alex
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:33.960]  And he's not going to reach them
[3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:35.960]  That's all I'm trying to say
[3:39:35.960 --> 3:39:37.960]  Alright, let me just put it to you this way
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:41.960]  I don't necessarily like the term chattel, cattle, sheeple
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:44.960]  But that is what they call us in their own documents
[3:39:44.960 --> 3:39:45.960]  In their own UN documents
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:47.960]  That is what we are referred to
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:49.960]  And I think that's why Alex uses the term all the time
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:51.960]  I know that's why I use the term
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:53.960]  Personally, I find it disgusting
[3:39:53.960 --> 3:39:57.960]  However, I do think that we have maybe earned that title
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:40:00.960]  I'm sorry, I mean, when your life revolves around
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:02.960]  40 hours of television a week
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:06.960]  And then, you know, another 60 hours of work a week
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:09.960]  And then you're not even, you don't even know what's going on
[3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:11.960]  In your own country, let alone geopolitics
[3:40:11.960 --> 3:40:13.960]  Hey, you might be sheeple
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:15.960]  And is it going to get to everybody?
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:17.960]  Maybe not, I mean, but there's other flavors of this
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:19.960]  It's not all about Alex Jones
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:21.960]  It's not all about Jason Bermas
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:23.960]  There's plenty of radio talk show hosts out there
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:25.960]  There's just not plenty of people motivated enough
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:28.960]  To put out the amount of production that Alex has done
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:31.960]  And be as successful, and that's why I love his model
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:34.960]  Hey, I'm all for all the other people out there
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:37.960]  Spreading this message who may not use that terminology
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:39.960]  We're not going to wake everybody up
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:41.960]  Hopefully we can wake somebody up
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:43.960]  And maybe their approach to waking someone up
[3:40:43.960 --> 3:40:45.960]  Wakes another person up that wouldn't be as susceptible
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:48.960]  To, say, a road to tyranny or a martial law
[3:40:48.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  You know, I just used the terminology they used
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:54.960]  And that's how I'm going to, how I'm going to put it
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:40:56.960]  I mean, are we sheep-like?
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:40:58.960]  Yes, in a lot of ways we are
[3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:02.960]  I'm not, I'm guilty too, okay?
[3:41:02.960 --> 3:41:04.960]  I can't wait to get home
[3:41:04.960 --> 3:41:07.960]  And be able to take a couple weeks, you know, off
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:10.960]  And lie down and watch what, you know, the Hollywood propaganda
[3:41:10.960 --> 3:41:12.960]  That's put out on a big screen television
[3:41:12.960 --> 3:41:14.960]  I'm guilty, I want to do that
[3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:17.960]  I long for it, I long to sit back
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:19.960]  And, you know, hang out with my dogs for a couple days
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:22.960]  And barbecue and just forget about all this stuff
[3:41:22.960 --> 3:41:24.960]  But that's not my primary deal, you know
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:27.960]  There are a lot of people that that's what their whole life revolves around
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:30.960]  Each day, every day, and that's the huge problem
[3:41:30.960 --> 3:41:33.960]  And that's why we have a mass of, you know
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  Brainwashed, mesmerized, hypnotized people
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:38.960]  That just want to go along to get along
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:41.960]  Will stand in a four-hour line for an iPhone
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:44.960]  And then pay a ridiculous fee
[3:41:44.960 --> 3:41:47.960]  Like, I think it's somewhere between like $100 and $200 a month
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:50.960]  And you have to sign a two-year contract with them
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:53.960]  I mean, that's what this society has become
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:54.960]  I thank you for the call, Peggy
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:41:56.960]  You're always welcome to disagree on this program
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:41:58.960]  And if you tell us, you disagree
[3:41:58.960 --> 3:42:00.960]  You go to the headline
[3:42:00.960 --> 3:42:02.960]  Remember, Overdrive is coming up
[3:42:02.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  In about 20 minutes with Ralph Nader
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:08.960]  Going to be broadcast live from Justin.tv
[3:42:08.960 --> 3:42:10.960]  I'm very excited about that
[3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:12.960]  Let's continue with your calls
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:14.960]  Let's jump to Dylan in Texas
[3:42:14.960 --> 3:42:16.960]  Dylan, what's up?
[3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:18.960]  What's it going on?
[3:42:18.960 --> 3:42:23.960]  Yeah, I wanted to ask if if you're with anybody's ever confronted
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:27.960]  That sheet of old mountain on that article she wrote
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:30.960]  Ah, I know what you're talking about
[3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:32.960]  Alright, first let's talk about the article
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:34.960]  Alright, and we'll break this down together
[3:42:34.960 --> 3:42:36.960]  Now, the article she talks about is
[3:42:36.960 --> 3:42:39.960]  She actually cops to the fact that, yes
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.960]  There were weapons found on other planes
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:43.960]  We go over that and fabled enemies, okay
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:46.960]  She also cops to the fact that she thinks that
[3:42:46.960 --> 3:42:48.960]  United 93 was shot down
[3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:50.960]  And that would have been impossible for them to bring it down
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  In that manner
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:54.960]  And then she asked another couple 9-11 truth questions
[3:42:54.960 --> 3:42:57.960]  And I think this was only a couple months after the attack, correct?
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:42:59.960]  Yeah, it was six months, and she asked also
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:01.960]  What happened to the black box data
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:02.960]  Uh-huh
[3:43:02.960 --> 3:43:04.960]  What's the name of that article? You got it in front of you?
[3:43:04.960 --> 3:43:06.960]  Yeah, it's titled, Just Wondering
[3:43:06.960 --> 3:43:08.960]  Really easy to find, it's just in quotes
[3:43:08.960 --> 3:43:11.960]  Type in Just Wondering and Michelle Malkin
[3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:14.960]  Now, as far as I know, that is before she became
[3:43:14.960 --> 3:43:16.960]  O'Reilly's co-host, okay
[3:43:16.960 --> 3:43:19.960]  That's before she got all this national syndication
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:20.960]  Through Fox Radio
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:25.960]  And it really seems that not so far after that article
[3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:27.960]  She totally flipped her position
[3:43:27.960 --> 3:43:29.960]  And especially years later, when the 9-11 truth movement
[3:43:29.960 --> 3:43:33.960]  Became more prominent, that kind of went into the dustbin, didn't it?
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:35.960]  And just to answer your question
[3:43:35.960 --> 3:43:37.960]  Yeah, just to answer your question, I don't know of anybody
[3:43:37.960 --> 3:43:39.960]  Who's confronted her on that article
[3:43:39.960 --> 3:43:41.960]  Although, that would be a great topic
[3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:43.960]  To call into her radio show with
[3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:45.960]  On the fly, you know, again, make up another topic
[3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:47.960]  And then when you get on the air with her
[3:43:47.960 --> 3:43:49.960]  Say, you know, I'd really like to go over this article
[3:43:49.960 --> 3:43:51.960]  That you wrote called, Just Wondering
[3:43:51.960 --> 3:43:53.960]  Six months after the attacks of 9-11
[3:43:53.960 --> 3:43:55.960]  And see if she hangs up on you, and if she doesn't
[3:43:55.960 --> 3:43:57.960]  Keep on pressing, man
[3:43:57.960 --> 3:43:59.960]  We've got to use their own ammunition against them
[3:43:59.960 --> 3:44:02.960]  I think that's why, you know, loose change is so successful
[3:44:02.960 --> 3:44:04.960]  I think that's why fabled enemies will be successful
[3:44:04.960 --> 3:44:07.960]  It's because we show you the mainstream news articles
[3:44:07.960 --> 3:44:09.960]  And the mainstream media coverage
[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:12.960]  From Fox, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS
[3:44:12.960 --> 3:44:14.960]  We don't discriminate, discriminate
[3:44:14.960 --> 3:44:16.960]  That contradicts the official version
[3:44:16.960 --> 3:44:18.960]  I think that's why these films are powerful
[3:44:18.960 --> 3:44:19.960]  Do you agree?
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:21.960]  Absolutely, man
[3:44:21.960 --> 3:44:23.960]  And I think they're just getting better and better
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:25.960]  As more info comes out
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:27.960]  I think the accumulation of data
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:29.960]  Over the last couple of years
[3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:32.960]  You know, you have X amount after a couple of months
[3:44:32.960 --> 3:44:35.960]  And just, yeah, it's amazing how everything you've got now
[3:44:35.960 --> 3:44:37.960]  From 01 to now, and I mean, there's going to continue
[3:44:37.960 --> 3:44:39.960]  To be more things coming out
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:41.960]  And, you know, by the time you get to sequel
[3:44:41.960 --> 3:44:43.960]  Out to any of these films, there's just that much more
[3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:46.960]  To go to home, so, yeah, make it up to good work
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:48.960]  And do a good job this week
[3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:49.960]  Alright, thanks, Dylan
[3:44:49.960 --> 3:44:51.960]  I really appreciate the call and the kind words
[3:44:51.960 --> 3:44:53.960]  Let's jump to Derek in Montana
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:55.960]  Derek, what's on your mind?
[3:44:56.960 --> 3:44:57.960]  Hello?
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:44:58.960]  Yes?
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:00.960]  Oh, yeah, I wanted to make a comment about
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:03.960]  Camtrails, where I'm living at now
[3:45:03.960 --> 3:45:05.960]  We don't have any, but, wow, in Jersey
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:07.960]  Where I just moved from recently
[3:45:07.960 --> 3:45:10.960]  I'd look up every day and see them
[3:45:10.960 --> 3:45:12.960]  And then it'd be a couple of days
[3:45:12.960 --> 3:45:14.960]  When you wouldn't see them
[3:45:14.960 --> 3:45:17.960]  And then you'd see a whole bunch the next day
[3:45:17.960 --> 3:45:20.960]  And literally everybody in the whole neighborhood
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:23.960]  Is just somehow sick a week later
[3:45:23.960 --> 3:45:26.960]  At a ridiculous rate around
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:29.960]  Everybody's getting sick
[3:45:29.960 --> 3:45:32.960]  And they would just rain for three or four days at a time
[3:45:32.960 --> 3:45:34.960]  After you see those
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:38.960]  I was wondering if you had any idea about that
[3:45:38.960 --> 3:45:41.960]  Since they're supposedly also manipulating the weather
[3:45:41.960 --> 3:45:44.960]  Does it cause it, or they put it in the air
[3:45:44.960 --> 3:45:47.960]  And then they make it rain down onto the
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:49.960]  Well, how are they dispersing it to the people, in other words
[3:45:49.960 --> 3:45:52.960]  I mean, are these clouds forming with rain clouds?
[3:45:52.960 --> 3:45:56.960]  No, they flew over and then clouds appeared
[3:45:56.960 --> 3:45:59.960]  There would just be streams coming from jets overhead
[3:45:59.960 --> 3:46:02.960]  No, what I'm saying is they would seed the clouds
[3:46:02.960 --> 3:46:05.960]  You would have this big smog and then actual clouds would come in
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:07.960]  And it would rain and people would get sick
[3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:10.960]  Probably from the aluminum, the barium, the magnesium
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:14.960]  That is contained in these artificial, quote, unquote
[3:46:14.960 --> 3:46:17.960]  You know, again, Rosalind called them
[3:46:17.960 --> 3:46:18.960]  Contrails, I think that
[3:46:18.960 --> 3:46:21.960]  Camtrails is an appropriate term
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:23.960]  But are they making people sick?
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:26.960]  Yeah, that seems to be what they are doing
[3:46:26.960 --> 3:46:29.960]  And they also, you know, we had one caller say
[3:46:29.960 --> 3:46:31.960]  He believes it's part of a eugenics program
[3:46:31.960 --> 3:46:32.960]  I don't necessarily disagree
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:34.960]  Yeah, I heard that guy, I figured
[3:46:34.960 --> 3:46:35.960]  I just would call in
[3:46:35.960 --> 3:46:37.960]  I was trying to call in when she was on
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:40.960]  And just say, yeah, they do get people sick
[3:46:40.960 --> 3:46:42.960]  And I can tell you that they seem to only do them
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:44.960]  In highly populated areas
[3:46:44.960 --> 3:46:46.960]  Because that was a big city where I'm from
[3:46:46.960 --> 3:46:48.960]  Now I live in the middle of nowhere
[3:46:48.960 --> 3:46:49.960]  And I never see them
[3:46:49.960 --> 3:46:52.960]  Well, I gotta tell you, I'm in upstate New York
[3:46:52.960 --> 3:46:54.960]  I don't know, three hours from Manhattan or Jersey
[3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:56.960]  Actually, it's only about two and a half from the Jersey
[3:46:56.960 --> 3:46:58.960]  Or the Garden State Parkway
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:47:00.960]  And, I mean, although it's a college town
[3:47:00.960 --> 3:47:01.960]  There's a couple colleges here
[3:47:01.960 --> 3:47:03.960]  We have a few thousand people here and there
[3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:04.960]  Even when the colleges aren't around
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:06.960]  They spray there all the time
[3:47:06.960 --> 3:47:09.960]  But you may be right, they may not be going into the
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:11.960]  Most rural of areas
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:13.960]  But I've seen their program really expand
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:14.960]  In the last five years
[3:47:14.960 --> 3:47:15.960]  I thank you for the call, Derek
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:18.960]  All right, let's go to Tom in Pennsylvania
[3:47:18.960 --> 3:47:20.960]  Tom, what's on your mind?
[3:47:20.960 --> 3:47:21.960]  Hey, Jason, how you doing?
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:22.960]  Good, man
[3:47:22.960 --> 3:47:25.960]  I've got a couple of quickies here for you
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:28.960]  On the spraying
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:33.960]  Just here in the Fort County area of Philadelphia
[3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:34.960]  In the last couple days
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:36.960]  They've been spraying with all kinds of stuff
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:38.960]  Without giving people notice
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:40.960]  Spraying pesticides and that kind of stuff
[3:47:40.960 --> 3:47:41.960]  Using airplanes to do it
[3:47:41.960 --> 3:47:44.960]  So, you know, I'm not gonna dwell on that
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:47.960]  But also on the international property code
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:48.960]  Maintenance code
[3:47:48.960 --> 3:47:51.960]  I served on borough counsel for eight years
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:54.960]  Finished up my second term
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:55.960]  As of January
[3:47:55.960 --> 3:47:57.960]  And international property maintenance code
[3:47:57.960 --> 3:47:59.960]  Was one of those things that was adopted by
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:01.960]  The borough
[3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:03.960]  I kept fighting against it
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:05.960]  Because it says right in there
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:07.960]  That the code enforcement guy using this
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:09.960]  Property maintenance code
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:11.960]  Can't come into your property
[3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:12.960]  Without a warrant
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:14.960]  Without any reasonable cause
[3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:16.960]  Or, you know, it's just
[3:48:16.960 --> 3:48:18.960]  The guy's right when he was telling you
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:22.960]  How bad this international maintenance code is
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:23.960]  And who does it give the authority to?
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:25.960]  Is it give it to an international body
[3:48:25.960 --> 3:48:26.960]  Like the United Nations?
[3:48:26.960 --> 3:48:28.960]  Or who is this code under?
[3:48:28.960 --> 3:48:30.960]  Obviously, it's under the United States law
[3:48:30.960 --> 3:48:32.960]  But if it's an international code
[3:48:32.960 --> 3:48:33.960]  I'm wondering
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:37.960]  It's developed by United Nations
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:42.960]  And some international bodies
[3:48:42.960 --> 3:48:45.960]  Non-governmental bodies
[3:48:45.960 --> 3:48:48.960]  They came up with this thing
[3:48:48.960 --> 3:48:50.960]  And like he says
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:53.960]  They can come in and condemn properties
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:48:55.960]  For pretty much nothing
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:48:56.960]  And I'm just wondering
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:48:57.960]  I have a copy
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:48:59.960]  But it's under a pile of stuff here
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:01.960]  So I can't find it right now
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:02.960]  Well, that's alright
[3:49:02.960 --> 3:49:03.960]  But I'm just wondering
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:05.960]  Has this code been used in the United States?
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:06.960]  And it's so where?
[3:49:06.960 --> 3:49:07.960]  Yes
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:10.960]  It's been adopted by most municipalities
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:12.960]  At least here in Pennsylvania
[3:49:12.960 --> 3:49:14.960]  I know a lot of municipalities have adopted it
[3:49:14.960 --> 3:49:16.960]  Now, I kept it off the books
[3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:17.960]  They had adopted one back in
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:19.960]  It's been around for years too
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:21.960]  Yeah, he said it was three
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:23.960]  No, it's been around longer now
[3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:25.960]  Well, this might have been actually something
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:27.960]  That Alex Jones covered in America
[3:49:27.960 --> 3:49:29.960]  Destroyed by design back in 97
[3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:31.960]  When he did his first documentary
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:34.960]  And showed the expansion of international power
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:35.960]  Especially that of the UN
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:37.960]  So, you know, he might be on more
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:40.960]  When he was talking about the O3 code
[3:49:40.960 --> 3:49:42.960]  That's the most recent code, Al
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:45.960]  It's been around since the early 90s
[3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:47.960]  Because the downtown
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:50.960]  Operated under the old 1990s code
[3:49:50.960 --> 3:49:51.960]  Whatever that was
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:53.960]  And it took them several years
[3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:56.960]  And I ended up, you know, I would get complaints
[3:49:56.960 --> 3:49:59.960]  From constituents
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:03.960]  Or copies of complaints that they would give me
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:05.960]  And I would call the constituents
[3:50:05.960 --> 3:50:06.960]  And tell them, look
[3:50:06.960 --> 3:50:08.960]  This code has not been adopted
[3:50:08.960 --> 3:50:09.960]  Because they were trying to say
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:11.960]  That they had adopted the 2000s code
[3:50:11.960 --> 3:50:12.960]  They could do whatever they wanted
[3:50:12.960 --> 3:50:13.960]  I thank you for the call, Tom
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:14.960]  This is very interesting
[3:50:14.960 --> 3:50:16.960]  Maybe we're gonna have to do this whole show
[3:50:16.960 --> 3:50:17.960]  It's an interesting topic
[3:50:17.960 --> 3:50:19.960]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com
[3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:20.960]  Remember, we'll be back after this
[3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:42.960]  And then overdrive with Ralph Nader
[3:51:05.960 --> 3:51:07.960]  Thousands of special video reports
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:09.960]  From tainted vaccines to martial law
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:11.960]  Can be found in this online video library
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:13.960]  My weekly news television broadcast

[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:16.960]  And so much more

[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:29.960]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[3:51:29.960 --> 3:51:30.960]  Listener, ask yourself
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:32.960]  Can I be deceived?
[3:51:32.960 --> 3:51:34.960]  Matthew 24 states four times
[3:51:34.960 --> 3:51:36.960]  In the last days, many will be deceived
[3:51:36.960 --> 3:51:38.960]  There are many ideas about the Mark of the Beast
[3:51:38.960 --> 3:51:40.960]  And the Antichrist
[3:51:40.960 --> 3:51:41.960]  What do you know about the beast?
[3:51:41.960 --> 3:51:43.960]  It's Mark and the Antichrist
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:45.960]  Is the beast a superpower nation
[3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:47.960]  Or a giant computer in Belgium
[3:51:47.960 --> 3:51:49.960]  Is it's Mark an implanted chip
[3:51:49.960 --> 3:51:50.960]  A tattoo
[3:51:50.960 --> 3:51:51.960]  The National ID card
[3:51:51.960 --> 3:51:52.960]  Or 666
[3:51:52.960 --> 3:51:55.960]  Is the Antichrist a person, title or both
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:57.960]  Some believe these things are in the future
[3:51:57.960 --> 3:51:59.960]  Others believe that it's in the past
[3:51:59.960 --> 3:52:01.960]  First John states the Antichrist
[3:52:01.960 --> 3:52:03.960]  Is already in the world
[3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:04.960]  What is the truth?
[3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:05.960]  And what is a lie?
[3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:07.960]  Are you willing to search God's word for the truth?
[3:52:07.960 --> 3:52:09.960]  Friends, these answers are in the Bible
[3:52:09.960 --> 3:52:12.960]  For free books, DVDs and Bible studies
[3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:15.960]  Exposing the Antichrist, the beast and its Mark
[3:52:15.960 --> 3:52:17.960]  According to the Bible says
[3:52:17.960 --> 3:52:19.960]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee
[3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:21.960]  37771
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:25.960]  Or call 888-211-1715
[3:52:25.960 --> 3:52:28.960]  That's 888-211-1715
[3:52:28.960 --> 3:52:30.960]  Since the year 2000
[3:52:30.960 --> 3:52:32.960]  Earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods,
[3:52:32.960 --> 3:52:34.960]  fires and hurricanes have killed
[3:52:34.960 --> 3:52:36.960]  Over one million people worldwide
[3:52:36.960 --> 3:52:38.960]  And forced tens of millions to go without food and water
[3:52:38.960 --> 3:52:41.960]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims
[3:52:41.960 --> 3:52:43.960]  In New Orleans begging for food
[3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:45.960]  The master strikes you and your loved ones
[3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:47.960]  And you have no stored food
[3:52:47.960 --> 3:52:49.960]  You'll be begging as well
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:51.960]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:53.960]  That even Donald Trump says
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:52:55.960]  Will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:52:57.960]  The US dollar is worth less today
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:52:59.960]  Than it was even last week
[3:52:59.960 --> 3:53:01.960]  Before food prices skyrocket
[3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:03.960]  Truck stop running and stores close their doors
[3:53:03.960 --> 3:53:05.960]  Survival enterprises can help you prepare
[3:53:05.960 --> 3:53:07.960]  They're master distributors of
[3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:09.960]  Mountain House freeze-dried food

[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:40.960]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded
[3:53:40.960 --> 3:53:45.960]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
[3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:50.960]  Everybody knows the war is over
[3:53:50.960 --> 3:53:53.960]  It's too bad, the good guy's lost
[3:53:53.960 --> 3:53:55.960]  But I ain't gonna lose
[3:53:55.960 --> 3:53:57.960]  I'm in it to win it baby
[3:53:57.960 --> 3:53:59.960]  I'm gonna keep pushing until I win
[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:01.960]  Or I'm dead
[3:54:01.960 --> 3:54:03.960]  Hopefully I'm looking for the win
[3:54:03.960 --> 3:54:06.960]  I wanna live my very long and fruitful life
[3:54:06.960 --> 3:54:08.960]  I know you do too out there
[3:54:08.960 --> 3:54:10.960]  You know, I'm not trying to insult people
[3:54:10.960 --> 3:54:12.960]  When I talk about the sheeple, but man
[3:54:12.960 --> 3:54:14.960]  When we allow
[3:54:14.960 --> 3:54:16.960]  Not only our nation
[3:54:16.960 --> 3:54:18.960]  But our hearts
[3:54:18.960 --> 3:54:20.960]  As human beings to get so far away
[3:54:20.960 --> 3:54:22.960]  From what is important in life
[3:54:22.960 --> 3:54:24.960]  It's hard to call them anything else
[3:54:24.960 --> 3:54:27.960]  Alright, I'm gonna shoot through these last few callers
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:30.960]  And remember, Overdrive with Alex Jones and Ralph Nader

[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:39.960]  Big Roberts in the first hour was just a tremendous
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:41.960]  Incredible interview
[3:54:41.960 --> 3:54:43.960]  And I don't think anybody should miss it
[3:54:43.960 --> 3:54:44.960]  I'm sure they're gonna be doing stories at
[3:54:44.960 --> 3:54:46.960]  PrismPlanet.tv and whatnot
[3:54:46.960 --> 3:54:48.960]  I also wanna remind people that Fable Enemies
[3:54:48.960 --> 3:54:51.960]  Drops on PrismPlanet.tv

[3:54:59.960 --> 3:55:01.960]  If you can't wait that long
[3:55:01.960 --> 3:55:03.960]  Or if you're willing to wait that long, actually
[3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:05.960]  You can come down to New York City to the big event
[3:55:05.960 --> 3:55:08.960]  September 10th, myself and Alex Jones will be showing
[3:55:08.960 --> 3:55:10.960]  Fable Enemies and Truth Rising
[3:55:10.960 --> 3:55:12.960]  And then of course we will down at Ground Zero
[3:55:12.960 --> 3:55:14.960]  On September 11th, and there are more events
[3:55:14.960 --> 3:55:17.960]  During the weekend following September 11th
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:19.960]  Alright, let's jump to Dick in Denver
[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:21.960]  Dick, what's on your mind?
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:23.960]  Thank you for taking my call
[3:55:23.960 --> 3:55:25.960]  A couple things real quick
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:28.960]  One is, you know, I'm living here in Denver
[3:55:28.960 --> 3:55:30.960]  My son and I are both big supporters
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:32.960]  We're also kind of big guys
[3:55:32.960 --> 3:55:35.960]  If you want, I can give you my telephone number
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:37.960]  Up there and you can call me back
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:39.960]  And we'd be happy to watch Alex's back
[3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:42.960]  I have standing in the 9-11 truth community
[3:55:42.960 --> 3:55:46.960]  Here in Denver, I helped the We Are Change people
[3:55:46.960 --> 3:55:48.960]  Deal with their situation
[3:55:48.960 --> 3:55:50.960]  When they were arrested for passing out DVDs
[3:55:50.960 --> 3:55:52.960]  On the 16th Street Mall
[3:55:52.960 --> 3:55:54.960]  Let's talk about that really quick
[3:55:54.960 --> 3:55:56.960]  Because they were actually arrested
[3:55:56.960 --> 3:55:58.960]  For being outside of the mall, handing it out
[3:55:58.960 --> 3:56:00.960]  And they said that they were...
[3:56:00.960 --> 3:56:02.960]  What was the term that they used?
[3:56:02.960 --> 3:56:04.960]  They arrested them under some kind of ridiculous...
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:06.960]  They said that they were peddling without a license
[3:56:06.960 --> 3:56:08.960]  That's right, peddling, and they weren't selling anything
[3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:10.960]  And I actually took the time to call
[3:56:10.960 --> 3:56:12.960]  The District Sergeant
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:14.960]  For that district
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:16.960]  And check with him
[3:56:16.960 --> 3:56:18.960]  And then run
[3:56:18.960 --> 3:56:20.960]  And explain the situation
[3:56:20.960 --> 3:56:22.960]  Precisely, and then run it down
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:24.960]  And what I tried to do
[3:56:24.960 --> 3:56:26.960]  Was make it a topic
[3:56:26.960 --> 3:56:28.960]  For their agenda at the morning meeting
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:30.960]  So that they could tell the rest of the officers
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:32.960]  If you're passing out DVDs
[3:56:32.960 --> 3:56:34.960]  And of course, you've seen some of the follow-up
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:36.960]  Mark Silverman from the local ACLU
[3:56:36.960 --> 3:56:38.960]  Wrote a letter
[3:56:38.960 --> 3:56:40.960]  And it was published
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:42.960]  And there was a follow-up to it
[3:56:42.960 --> 3:56:44.960]  I'm sure the charges will be dropped
[3:56:44.960 --> 3:56:46.960]  And they'll be okay
[3:56:46.960 --> 3:56:48.960]  But there were a few things that you need to be aware of
[3:56:48.960 --> 3:56:50.960]  When you're working on the street
[3:56:50.960 --> 3:56:52.960]  Such as not having things that you set down
[3:56:52.960 --> 3:56:54.960]  On the sidewalk, you have to pack everything
[3:56:54.960 --> 3:56:56.960]  In a backpack
[3:56:56.960 --> 3:56:58.960]  So that you can't get arrested
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:00.960]  On the technicality of obstructing
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:02.960]  The sidewalk or that kind of thing
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:04.960]  But my son and I
[3:57:04.960 --> 3:57:06.960]  Would be more than happy
[3:57:06.960 --> 3:57:08.960]  To help with security for Alex
[3:57:08.960 --> 3:57:10.960]  If I'd be happy to give you
[3:57:10.960 --> 3:57:12.960]  My phone number up there
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:14.960]  The other thing is
[3:57:14.960 --> 3:57:16.960]  On the sheeple issue
[3:57:16.960 --> 3:57:18.960]  Originally, we were called citizens
[3:57:18.960 --> 3:57:20.960]  We were all citizens of the United States
[3:57:20.960 --> 3:57:22.960]  Of America
[3:57:22.960 --> 3:57:24.960]  There was a very subtle, very gradual shift
[3:57:24.960 --> 3:57:26.960]  We were calling us consumers
[3:57:26.960 --> 3:57:28.960]  But you must watch out with the term
[3:57:28.960 --> 3:57:30.960]  Sheeple because there's a tendency
[3:57:30.960 --> 3:57:32.960]  To vilify other people
[3:57:32.960 --> 3:57:34.960]  Or dehumanize them in one way or another
[3:57:34.960 --> 3:57:36.960]  Call them a name
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:38.960]  And it's easier to dehumanize them
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:40.960]  Alright, Dick, I appreciate the perspective
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:42.960]  And the phone call
[3:57:42.960 --> 3:57:44.960]  We're gonna have to wrap it up here
[3:57:44.960 --> 3:57:46.960]  But we're really not going anywhere
[3:57:46.960 --> 3:57:48.960]  If you're over at infowars.com
[3:57:48.960 --> 3:57:50.960]  We're gonna be streaming live
[3:57:50.960 --> 3:57:52.960]  Remember Alex Jones, Ralph Nader
[3:57:52.960 --> 3:57:54.960]  And we'll see
[3:57:54.960 --> 3:57:56.960]  And all week

[3:57:58.960 --> 3:58:00.960]  Making the news, that's what we're doing
[3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:02.960]  And reporting the truth
[3:58:02.960 --> 3:58:04.960]  We'll be back tomorrow
[3:58:06.960 --> 3:58:08.960]  Good job, Jason
[3:58:08.960 --> 3:58:10.960]  And it's easier to dehumanize them
[3:58:10.960 --> 3:58:12.960]  Alright, Dick, I appreciate the perspective
[3:58:12.960 --> 3:58:14.960]  And the phone call
[3:58:14.960 --> 3:58:16.960]  We're gonna have to wrap it up here
[3:58:16.960 --> 3:58:18.960]  But we're really not going anywhere
[3:58:18.960 --> 3:58:20.960]  If you're over at infowars.com
[3:58:20.960 --> 3:58:22.960]  And you can find us
[3:58:22.960 --> 3:58:24.960]  And check out the live feeds
[3:58:24.960 --> 3:58:26.960]  And see if we can hear them
[3:58:26.960 --> 3:58:28.960]  In the background right now
[3:58:28.960 --> 3:58:30.960]  It's breaking up back and forth
[3:58:30.960 --> 3:58:32.960]  But it looks like they're setting up the interview
[3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:34.960]  Yes, I can, Alex
[3:58:34.960 --> 3:58:36.960]  How are you doing out there?
[3:58:36.960 --> 3:58:38.960]  We got into the hotel
[3:58:38.960 --> 3:58:40.960]  We've been messing with a lot of feeds
[3:58:40.960 --> 3:58:42.960]  We're up here trying to find his room
[3:58:42.960 --> 3:58:44.960]  We're bumbling around in this giant double
[3:58:44.960 --> 3:58:46.960]  Double hotel
[3:58:46.960 --> 3:58:48.960]  And passages across the road
[3:58:48.960 --> 3:58:52.540]  So just keep talking and we should be in there in the next five minutes. Then we got a set up
[3:58:52.540 --> 3:58:56.960]  So probably about 15 after is when we're doing this. Okay. All right, sounds good
[3:58:58.640 --> 3:59:01.700]  All right, so we're gonna fade that down for the next 15 minutes. I
[3:59:02.920 --> 3:59:08.780]  Want to read this this mashable blogger lie about Alex Jones right now?
[3:59:09.780 --> 3:59:11.420]  Okay
[3:59:11.420 --> 3:59:18.080]  This is just it's just ridiculous blogger Michelle Malkin attacked in Denver near DNC oh wait first of all no one attacked her
[3:59:18.760 --> 3:59:20.760]  No one physically put their hands
[3:59:21.280 --> 3:59:23.280]  on Michelle Malkin
[3:59:23.440 --> 3:59:25.840]  Michelle Malkin does not make that climb claim either
[3:59:27.880 --> 3:59:34.640]  Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin was beset by a horde of self-described leftist anarchists not far from the site of the Democratic National
[3:59:34.880 --> 3:59:36.360]  Convention earlier today
[3:59:36.360 --> 3:59:44.120]  The mob was led by well-known left-wing conspiracy theory radio show host Alex Jones say he's a left-winger folks
[3:59:44.680 --> 3:59:48.560]  Of course, we know he is not left-wing whatsoever
[3:59:49.200 --> 3:59:51.560]  Who was at the protest in that and again?
[3:59:51.560 --> 3:59:56.840]  He was not at the protest designed to and I'm not exaggerating at all levitate the Denver Mint
[3:59:56.840 --> 3:59:57.640]  No
[3:59:57.640 --> 4:00:02.880]  First of all he was walking through the DNC. He wasn't quote-unquote at the protest
[4:00:02.880 --> 4:00:11.240]  He didn't surround the Denver Mint. He didn't try to levitate anything. He was there to show what morons these guys are and
[4:00:12.120 --> 4:00:16.640]  How absurd the idea of recreate 68 is?
[4:00:18.280 --> 4:00:20.400]  Not only did they fail folks and
[4:00:21.600 --> 4:00:24.560]  inciting the the violent riots that they wish to
[4:00:25.480 --> 4:00:27.000]  wish to do
[4:00:27.000 --> 4:00:28.840]  but
[4:00:28.840 --> 4:00:30.840]  unbelievably
[4:00:30.840 --> 4:00:38.880]  They made themselves look ludicrous by dressing up like Mickey Mouse from Fantasia and
[4:00:39.160 --> 4:00:47.120]  Saying they're going to use their magical powers to get rid of the Denver Mint that prints some of the money in this country. I
[4:00:47.760 --> 4:00:54.320]  Hate these anti-capitalists. I'm not saying we even have true capitalism in America anymore, but I ain't no socialist
[4:00:54.320 --> 4:01:00.000]  I'm no communist. I believe that people that work harder and are smarter should make more money
[4:01:00.000 --> 4:01:02.760]  People with bigger and better ideas
[4:01:04.240 --> 4:01:06.240]  It's the American dream, baby
[4:01:06.360 --> 4:01:12.040]  And I don't think that we should all get the same amount of money and the same amount of rations and live in the same kind of house
[4:01:12.040 --> 4:01:16.440]  It doesn't work that way. People are not the same. Some are not motivated
[4:01:16.880 --> 4:01:18.880]  some of you right now are
[4:01:19.040 --> 4:01:21.560]  Sitting there unfortunately with your big old belly
[4:01:23.960 --> 4:01:25.960]  Sucking down some chips
[4:01:25.960 --> 4:01:30.160]  Probably one of those Duncan Donuts Kuladas. It's got like
[4:01:30.920 --> 4:01:37.200]  9,000 calories in it. Just not caring about anything just like ah, you know, you're informed, but you're not gonna do anything
[4:01:37.560 --> 4:01:43.240]  Now there are other people that are listening to this broadcast and they're finding the most interesting information on it
[4:01:43.240 --> 4:01:46.720]  And they're writing blogs and they're spreading the truth. There are yet other people
[4:01:47.560 --> 4:01:54.000]  That are done listening to the broadcast and maybe made some phone calls or went into work and discussed the topics of the day with other people
[4:01:54.000 --> 4:01:56.600]  Trying to reach others as human beings and
[4:01:57.560 --> 4:02:03.880]  Yet there are others that maybe today decided to you know start their own project begin their own film
[4:02:04.400 --> 4:02:06.400]  You know start their own organization
[4:02:06.960 --> 4:02:09.240]  Or or find a way to New York City?
[4:02:09.240 --> 4:02:12.280]  Maybe let me maybe I just plug that right now and somebody said you know what?
[4:02:12.280 --> 4:02:16.400]  Maybe I am gonna go to New York. I'm gonna find a way down there. I want to talk to these people
[4:02:16.400 --> 4:02:18.800]  I want to be part of what's going down
[4:02:18.800 --> 4:02:24.280]  I want to combat the propaganda that the mainstream media keeps pushing on us. I want
[4:02:24.920 --> 4:02:26.280]  people to know
[4:02:26.280 --> 4:02:33.680]  That both Obama and McCain when they go to New York City for their quote-unquote forum for the family members are there to
[4:02:34.000 --> 4:02:39.560]  Grandstand they're not there for you and me. They're not there to promote ideas of freedom
[4:02:39.880 --> 4:02:45.080]  They're there to take advantage of a situation and have a media highlight
[4:02:45.080 --> 4:02:50.920]  That's what they're there for. They're there to further take control of our minds and
[4:02:51.440 --> 4:02:55.120]  That you know, I guess I'm taking a lot of heat for using the term sheeple
[4:02:56.480 --> 4:03:01.540]  And maybe rightfully so who knows I'm not perfect. I'm just a human being. I'm gonna make mistakes folks
[4:03:02.000 --> 4:03:05.040]  You know, I am no deity. I don't want you to worship me
[4:03:05.040 --> 4:03:10.120]  That's that's another thing that really pisses me off when I hear these people say that 9-11 is a is a cult
[4:03:10.640 --> 4:03:13.240]  9-11 truth is a cult really is it I
[4:03:13.240 --> 4:03:18.960]  Forgot I I was telling people to worship me or send me money and I'm living in an evangelist home
[4:03:18.960 --> 4:03:24.360]  I mean, how ridiculous is it that they try to equate us with like a cultism?
[4:03:25.280 --> 4:03:31.600]  Like a literal cult like we have some kind of leader that we're giving our money to and we dress up in a certain outfit
[4:03:31.600 --> 4:03:38.040]  No, when we get in when we put on an investigate 9-11 shirt or a 9-11 was an inside job shirt
[4:03:38.040 --> 4:03:42.360]  That's to show our solidarity. That's at an event. We don't wear them every day
[4:03:42.360 --> 4:03:45.640]  You know, we and the cult thing is just it's gross, man
[4:03:47.960 --> 4:03:52.760]  Alright, let's uh, let's go back to this article. That's just making me nauseous
[4:03:53.360 --> 4:03:58.480]  The mob was organized under the banner recreate 68 the mob. It wasn't even a mob. It was a bunch of
[4:03:59.280 --> 4:04:06.600]  Just Jack assery is what that whole thing was with the goal of reigniting the riots of 1968 around the Chicago
[4:04:06.600 --> 4:04:12.320]  Democratic convention and they did try to do it, but they were unsuccessful because of people like Jonathan Ellen
[4:04:12.320 --> 4:04:16.080]  Offs efforts and my efforts and Alex Jones's efforts and you know
[4:04:16.800 --> 4:04:22.800]  We exposed them thousands of people didn't want to show up to something that was provocative toward that was you know
[4:04:23.400 --> 4:04:25.400]  Put there to try to incite violence
[4:04:25.680 --> 4:04:32.720]  All right, so here they come lying about Alex again Alex Jones is indeed a left-wing blogger with an army of left-wing bloggers under his
[4:04:32.720 --> 4:04:34.720]  new media umbrella
[4:04:34.720 --> 4:04:36.720]  I'm in the office and
[4:04:37.280 --> 4:04:40.920]  We're not left-wing Aaron ain't left-wing. I ain't left-wing
[4:04:41.680 --> 4:04:43.680]  Kurt Nemo ain't left-wing
[4:04:43.720 --> 4:04:46.400]  Paul and Steve Watson ain't left-wing
[4:04:47.000 --> 4:04:51.800]  Okay, do we sometimes link to the raw story? Sure. Do we sometimes link to counterpunch? Sure
[4:04:51.800 --> 4:04:54.280]  Do we sometimes link to the Huffington Post you bet?
[4:04:54.760 --> 4:04:58.520]  But do we also link to Fox News? Yes, CNN you bet
[4:04:59.480 --> 4:05:01.400]  you know
[4:05:01.400 --> 4:05:09.100]  Anything that's telling a speck of the truth we will link to we will report on and it has nothing to do with being left or right
[4:05:09.320 --> 4:05:15.040]  He is the curator of a number of new media websites often cited by the left
[4:05:15.360 --> 4:05:21.480]  Including often cited again. It's always left left left right right right conservative conservative liberal liberal
[4:05:22.480 --> 4:05:24.480]  Republican Democrat
[4:05:25.280 --> 4:05:30.240]  You got to decide got to decide no you don't have to choose one of those sides. They are false
[4:05:30.240 --> 4:05:32.240]  paradigm sides
[4:05:32.840 --> 4:05:38.600]  Okay, they are used to try to get you on their team and the teams are owned by the same guy
[4:05:38.640 --> 4:05:42.360]  The same guy owns both teams. Do you get it?
[4:05:43.040 --> 4:05:45.760]  When they compete against each other, it's a joke
[4:05:49.520 --> 4:05:54.400]  Jones accompanied by a little more than a handful of protesters that showed up for the event again
[4:05:55.080 --> 4:05:57.760]  The protesters were not with Alex Jones
[4:05:57.760 --> 4:06:00.040]  The people who knew who Alex Jones were
[4:06:00.640 --> 4:06:05.040]  You know could hardly be considered a mob or a handful
[4:06:05.040 --> 4:06:11.120]  He was with his two camera guys and of course people are gonna go up to Alex because he's a radio and TV personality
[4:06:12.040 --> 4:06:16.400]  You know, these aren't the same people that were trying to lift the mint. It's ridiculous
[4:06:17.680 --> 4:06:24.640]  Now here's where it gets into big lies Jones accompanied by a little more than a handful of protesters that showed up for the event were documented chanting
[4:06:24.640 --> 4:06:31.440]  Kill Michelle Malkin only moments after chanting their previous refrain of love, peace and justice again the people that were
[4:06:31.440 --> 4:06:32.360]  uh
[4:06:32.360 --> 4:06:35.640]  shouting kill Michelle Malkin left with Michelle Malkin and
[4:06:36.560 --> 4:06:42.960]  They were wearing ridiculous outfits again had a Obama beret and some other ridiculous hat
[4:06:44.240 --> 4:06:46.240]  and they're the provocateurs and
[4:06:47.000 --> 4:06:52.960]  I don't know if they were part of that protest or not or they're just you know well-meaning idiots or morons
[4:06:52.960 --> 4:06:54.960]  But of course they uh
[4:06:55.280 --> 4:06:57.280]  They put their pictures up
[4:06:57.280 --> 4:07:03.840]  Just totally and completely idiotic after shouting orders to his followers to not let Michelle Malkin leave
[4:07:03.840 --> 4:07:08.480]  Alex Jones and a small mob of protesters followed by a much larger mob of press
[4:07:08.480 --> 4:07:13.920]  Huronged and screamed a bevy of personal and ideological attacks for a number of blocks as the
[4:07:13.920 --> 4:07:16.960]  Diminutive Malkin attempted to calmly flee the scene
[4:07:17.280 --> 4:07:20.960]  But for a bit of shoving a lot of yelling and a number of intimidation tactics
[4:07:20.960 --> 4:07:23.760]  No physical violence directly against Malkin took place
[4:07:23.760 --> 4:07:29.680]  But as the video captured by pajamas media reporters on the scene shows it could have been a picnic
[4:07:30.240 --> 4:07:34.720]  It couldn't have been a picnic for Michelle. Oh poor Michelle Malkin
[4:07:35.360 --> 4:07:36.240]  Please
[4:07:36.240 --> 4:07:40.960]  She's a little demon who care. I don't care. She's five foot nothing a hundred and nothing
[4:07:40.960 --> 4:07:45.600]  Her mouth is big enough to reach millions of people and tell them that torture is okay
[4:07:46.080 --> 4:07:47.200]  to keep
[4:07:47.200 --> 4:07:53.520]  Pressing the fear of the boogeyman to promote martial law and internment camps for Americans
[4:07:54.000 --> 4:08:01.600]  To give a free pass to soldiers whether or not they're killing innocent American or uh innocent uh civilians over there or animals
[4:08:01.600 --> 4:08:06.720]  Give me a break. Oh poor Michelle Malkin. I feel so bad for her
[4:08:07.920 --> 4:08:15.600]  What's most irritating is that once again tactics that originate from left-wing bloggers have bled into meat uh meat space
[4:08:15.600 --> 4:08:21.200]  Uh meat space and painted a picture that puts the new media in a poor light come on
[4:08:22.160 --> 4:08:28.000]  Left-wing left-wing we're not left. Well, I think they probably used the term left-wing about four more times in this short article
[4:08:28.400 --> 4:08:33.600]  Of course, I'm referring to the lousy vetting process that was in place during the republican primary youtube debates
[4:08:33.920 --> 4:08:39.680]  It was discovered during the uh broadcast of the show that one of the questionnaires was a plant from one of the democratic campaigns
[4:08:39.680 --> 4:08:46.720]  And a careful analysis of the rest of the bunch showed up that almost half of the questionnaires were democratic plants staffers organizers or bloggers
[4:08:47.040 --> 4:08:49.760]  No shock there same thing goes on with your right-wing guy
[4:08:51.040 --> 4:08:53.040]  It might be the one thing he got right in this article
[4:08:53.760 --> 4:08:58.960]  But again, it's all about attacking the other side. So maybe that would be the only part that has to actually be right
[4:09:01.280 --> 4:09:03.040]  Let's jump down a little bit
[4:09:03.040 --> 4:09:08.560]  Interestingly, it seems that despite being present for the threats the Denver police took no action against alex jones
[4:09:08.560 --> 4:09:14.960]  Or any of the other protesters calling for the death of miss malkin again alex jones did not call for the death of michelle malkin
[4:09:15.360 --> 4:09:17.760]  It's clear. It's on video. Give me a break
[4:09:19.280 --> 4:09:24.080]  Of course, the why would the police arrest him? He walked up and started making a statement
[4:09:24.720 --> 4:09:29.280]  She's a public figure. She's on the news. She spreads her lie. She's an author
[4:09:30.400 --> 4:09:33.760]  He has every right to go up to her and exercise his free speech
[4:09:33.760 --> 4:09:40.880]  Oh, man instead of taking the position of some of the liberals in the blogosphere
[4:09:41.120 --> 4:09:46.320]  The best move for democratic-aligned bloggers would be to immediately denounce the actions of alex jones
[4:09:46.640 --> 4:09:50.480]  So democrats don't link to alex. That's the next message
[4:09:50.800 --> 4:09:57.520]  Let's let's shred it into two sides right and left republican and democrat and then encourage the democrats
[4:09:58.240 --> 4:10:01.360]  Not to go to jones whatsoever
[4:10:01.360 --> 4:10:03.360]  Interesting
[4:10:05.600 --> 4:10:07.600]  The actions of alex jones
[4:10:07.600 --> 4:10:10.400]  Of course, the right will denounce jones and company. No, they won't
[4:10:11.200 --> 4:10:16.880]  No, you're a little uh fake right wing minions your o'reilly's your hand of these
[4:10:17.440 --> 4:10:18.480]  um
[4:10:18.480 --> 4:10:22.240]  Your limba's yeah, they'll denounce alex jones or they won't bring it up at all good for them
[4:10:23.280 --> 4:10:25.600]  We do we have a alex coming in now is that what uh
[4:10:25.600 --> 4:10:30.480]  Okay, I guess that we're going to go to the justin tv feed right now
[4:10:31.920 --> 4:10:36.160]  Yep, and uh, we'll pull it up and we'll see if this interview has started
[4:10:37.280 --> 4:10:40.080]  Again, you can see this over at info wars.com
[4:10:41.040 --> 4:10:43.040]  and prisonplanet.com
[4:10:44.640 --> 4:10:48.480]  And uh, hopefully in about three minutes, we're going to have the nadir interview live for you
[4:10:50.240 --> 4:10:52.240]  revolutionary radio folks
[4:10:52.240 --> 4:10:59.200]  And alex jones has really made the most of it. Hopefully inside editions piece will not be a total hit brigade, but
[4:11:00.560 --> 4:11:03.120]  I don't have too much confidence in the mainstream media
[4:11:03.120 --> 4:11:09.600]  And I know most of you listeners out there also do not have too much confidence in the mainstream media not that they've earned it
[4:11:11.760 --> 4:11:17.360]  And of course the uh end line of this terrible terrible libel article and it is libel by the way
[4:11:17.360 --> 4:11:21.600]  Those that use jones's sources on a regular basis would do good to distance themselves
[4:11:21.840 --> 4:11:26.640]  From this sort of ridiculous behavior or risk being painted with the same brush
[4:11:28.480 --> 4:11:31.120]  And what brush might that be the brush of freedom
[4:11:31.760 --> 4:11:32.960]  The, uh
[4:11:33.360 --> 4:11:44.240]  Brush of democracy the brush of a constitutional republic the brush of free speech the brush of new media taking over the corporate controlled media
[4:11:44.240 --> 4:11:52.240]  The corporate controlled media and i'm sick of the bull crap that this is somehow new media that she's with pajamas media
[4:11:54.560 --> 4:11:57.520]  Go to bed pajamas, please it's absolutely
[4:11:58.720 --> 4:12:00.480]  unbelievably disgusting
[4:12:00.480 --> 4:12:05.200]  See what they're doing is they're trying to have their little sub sex of neocon worshipers
[4:12:06.160 --> 4:12:12.560]  Uh probably what those two little anarchists your fake anarchists were you know, they're little provocateurs. They think it's funny
[4:12:12.560 --> 4:12:16.960]  And it is just it's beyond disturbing to me beyond
[4:12:18.160 --> 4:12:20.160]  I'm disturbing
[4:12:22.160 --> 4:12:29.280]  That these these sickos are going to present like these other blogs that are you know, little green footballs and all these other
[4:12:30.320 --> 4:12:33.840]  Uh god, I just i'm getting sick
[4:12:34.720 --> 4:12:39.680]  They they just sit there and they rant about how great the neocons are
[4:12:39.680 --> 4:12:42.560]  And how we just need to go and kill everybody
[4:12:43.520 --> 4:12:50.160]  And everything that george bush and his administration have done is the best thing since breakfast and dick cheney as a hero and you know
[4:12:51.520 --> 4:12:57.600]  What's going on with this carl rove situation? I'm not quite sure. I know that he left the country on on subpoena
[4:12:57.680 --> 4:13:01.200]  He's obviously back. I saw him on a riley last night at the dnc
[4:13:01.680 --> 4:13:06.240]  Proving once again that there is these people are above the law
[4:13:06.240 --> 4:13:10.480]  Okay, it's just like when liby gets convicted convicted
[4:13:11.600 --> 4:13:13.200]  in a court of law
[4:13:13.200 --> 4:13:15.440]  of releasing the name of valerie plane
[4:13:16.320 --> 4:13:18.320]  and you know helping in this you know
[4:13:18.640 --> 4:13:20.480]  really rather minor
[4:13:20.480 --> 4:13:24.080]  conspiracy to try to uh discredit claim and her claims
[4:13:25.040 --> 4:13:27.040]  against the uh
[4:13:27.040 --> 4:13:31.520]  The uranium the enriched uranium and niger which was completely and totally false of course
[4:13:32.880 --> 4:13:34.880]  so
[4:13:34.880 --> 4:13:39.920]  He gets jail time. Okay, most of the jurors know that cheney is involved also
[4:13:41.200 --> 4:13:42.720]  What happens
[4:13:42.720 --> 4:13:45.760]  george bush commutes his sentence. He doesn't even wait for uh
[4:13:47.040 --> 4:13:50.560]  For him to sweat it out and prison for six months or a year or anything
[4:13:51.440 --> 4:13:53.040]  A week later. He's like
[4:13:53.040 --> 4:13:56.240]  Yeah, i'm gonna i'm gonna commute liby's sentence. He doesn't deserve what he got
[4:13:57.520 --> 4:14:00.880]  And uh, you know, i'm probably gonna pardon him too when i leave
[4:14:00.880 --> 4:14:05.280]  You know when i pardon a bunch of other criminal friends of mine. It's gonna be a good time
[4:14:06.720 --> 4:14:08.720]  And we know clinton did it with many of people
[4:14:09.760 --> 4:14:11.760]  bush is gonna do it with many of people
[4:14:11.760 --> 4:14:13.280]  But that's how
[4:14:13.280 --> 4:14:17.760]  Transparent the evil is that they can do this in public in your face
[4:14:18.880 --> 4:14:20.880]  On television for all to see
[4:14:22.400 --> 4:14:25.120]  And still you know still
[4:14:25.920 --> 4:14:27.280]  Nothing is done
[4:14:27.280 --> 4:14:31.920]  Rove still parades around like he's some kind of hero. He goes on tv
[4:14:33.280 --> 4:14:34.640]  it's
[4:14:34.640 --> 4:14:36.080]  It's outlandish
[4:14:36.080 --> 4:14:37.680]  It's unacceptable
[4:14:37.680 --> 4:14:40.640]  And it should be infuriating to all the listeners out there
[4:14:41.440 --> 4:14:47.120]  You should literally have your fist clenched like this. Have it beat red and beam. Why are we taking this?
[4:14:47.760 --> 4:14:49.760]  What the hell is going on?
[4:14:50.000 --> 4:14:51.520]  But you're not
[4:14:51.520 --> 4:14:53.280]  You're sitting back
[4:14:53.280 --> 4:14:54.800]  You're relaxing
[4:14:54.800 --> 4:14:58.400]  And you're like, oh, wow, this is really scary. I don't know if I can do it. Okay, are we good?
[4:14:58.640 --> 4:15:02.560]  Okay, it seems that i'm gonna be able to fade the phone line up right now and we're gonna get to
[4:15:02.880 --> 4:15:05.040]  No, we're looking for the justin tv feed
[4:15:06.000 --> 4:15:08.320]  All right. Well, i'm still not getting it at all
[4:15:08.960 --> 4:15:12.000]  Okay, so uh, we're as soon as I have the justin tv feed
[4:15:12.320 --> 4:15:18.000]  We will go to it. It is not working for some reason. Uh, i'm gonna try to restart my firefox
[4:15:19.120 --> 4:15:21.120]  And uh, there we go
[4:15:21.120 --> 4:15:28.240]  I'm radio station bermas to sit in your hood here in dendon. Uh, yes, I am on 13 60s north of denver
[4:15:28.480 --> 4:15:31.360]  The lion uh is the station that carries it here for the service
[4:15:31.760 --> 4:15:36.240]  Uh, and we're looking at an affiliate. We only have about 65 stations sounds like a lot, but you know, it's not that many
[4:15:37.520 --> 4:15:42.560]  We're live on the radio that feed over a wireless card sitting video up. So if that's unimportant, let's go
[4:15:42.800 --> 4:15:46.400]  Yes, sir. Well, yes. I mean, they're they're waiting to go live people on the web are watching live
[4:15:46.400 --> 4:15:49.440]  We're gonna go live on the radio show in just a moment
[4:15:49.440 --> 4:15:54.880]  Uh, mr. Nader, it's really great to speak with you. We're live. Thank you. Thanks for taking 10 minutes out of our time
[4:15:54.880 --> 4:15:57.040]  I see you got media lined up down the hall here to talk to you
[4:15:57.680 --> 4:15:59.440]  uh, I've
[4:15:59.440 --> 4:16:01.440]  You know looked at the two candidates
[4:16:01.680 --> 4:16:06.000]  barack obama and of course john mccain, and I really don't see a lot of differences
[4:16:06.640 --> 4:16:12.400]  Uh, can you uh compare yourself to both john mccain and uh to of course barack obama pleaser
[4:16:13.440 --> 4:16:18.080]  Well, I think they're both uh, john mccain incorporated and a barack obama incorporated
[4:16:18.080 --> 4:16:23.040]  I think they have deferred the hopes and dreams and necessities of american people
[4:16:23.760 --> 4:16:26.480]  to dialing for corporate dollars and
[4:16:26.960 --> 4:16:33.040]  Doing the demands of the corporate lobbyist having said that obviously they have different personalities in temper
[4:16:33.680 --> 4:16:38.880]  For example, if you get john mccain angry and you are a defense contractor
[4:16:39.600 --> 4:16:41.600]  And he's president watch out
[4:16:41.760 --> 4:16:46.640]  It doesn't matter what the other republicans will say just the way he went out after that blowing tanker
[4:16:46.640 --> 4:16:50.000]  A 19 billion dollar deal when he's as senator
[4:16:50.800 --> 4:16:52.800]  Rock obama if he becomes president
[4:16:53.440 --> 4:16:56.240]  Um, he's going to have a harder time saying no
[4:16:56.880 --> 4:17:02.560]  To african-americans poor hot whites and latino. Why is they're going to say hey
[4:17:03.040 --> 4:17:08.320]  You're supposed to represent our interest. You becoming president is not just another career move, you know
[4:17:08.560 --> 4:17:10.560]  It's supposed to make the difference
[4:17:10.720 --> 4:17:13.840]  With mccain you're going to get a perpetual
[4:17:14.400 --> 4:17:15.280]  of
[4:17:15.280 --> 4:17:23.120]  A perpetual war candidate. I don't know where he got his aggressiveness and his militarism given his experiences in vietnam
[4:17:23.680 --> 4:17:25.040]  but it's
[4:17:25.040 --> 4:17:26.800]  It's demeaning to him
[4:17:26.800 --> 4:17:32.560]  And I think he's he's got to come forward with the same kind of a fervor and waging beats
[4:17:33.200 --> 4:17:35.200]  And putting forth the humanitarian
[4:17:35.440 --> 4:17:39.680]  Uh face of america, which is the best way to prevent trouble
[4:17:39.680 --> 4:17:47.680]  Well preparing yourself to rock obama. He said that he was going to basically pull us out of iraq now
[4:17:47.760 --> 4:17:53.280]  He's said that we're going to be staying there a while. He's talking about going to afghanistan increasing the troops of pakistan
[4:17:53.680 --> 4:17:57.680]  I he uh voted for the warrantless wiretaps american people
[4:17:58.080 --> 4:18:01.680]  What would you do if you were president with the warrantless wiretaps with the rendition
[4:18:02.240 --> 4:18:04.240]  wantonimo bay all the horrible
[4:18:04.240 --> 4:18:11.040]  Uh police state developments we've seen sir. I would stop the war crime. That's what he has to face how would if he becomes president
[4:18:11.120 --> 4:18:16.800]  Is he going to stop the continuation of bush chain his war crimes and the violation of our constitution?
[4:18:17.120 --> 4:18:23.600]  That means no wiretapping without judicial approval. You can get it very quickly and retroactively with the fights of court
[4:18:24.160 --> 4:18:28.720]  Uh, that is a violation of federal law without a judicial warrant
[4:18:28.800 --> 4:18:31.120]  You know carries a maximum five-year jail term
[4:18:31.120 --> 4:18:34.480]  That means do not head into the hottest
[4:18:35.040 --> 4:18:41.920]  Hotest coordinates nest in the world, which are the mountains of afghanistan and pakistan with our soldiers
[4:18:42.240 --> 4:18:48.240]  No one has ever conquered that area the british tried the russians tried under the soviet era
[4:18:48.560 --> 4:18:52.720]  And we're not going to be able to do it and the third is with broying from iraq
[4:18:52.800 --> 4:18:57.040]  But leaving 50 000 soldiers there and leaving military bases there
[4:18:57.040 --> 4:19:02.320]  How is that going to knock the bottom of the insurgency? Well, that's double speak, isn't it? Of course, it's double speak
[4:19:02.640 --> 4:19:07.040]  And it's military eight basically said there'll be 50 to 80 thousand soldiers there
[4:19:07.680 --> 4:19:12.000]  And uh, the corporate contractors will stay there because they're maintaining the military bases
[4:19:12.320 --> 4:19:14.320]  hella burton kbr
[4:19:14.560 --> 4:19:15.760]  blackwater
[4:19:15.760 --> 4:19:17.360]  um, I think uh
[4:19:17.360 --> 4:19:20.400]  Barack obama is trying to talk on both out of both sides this month
[4:19:21.040 --> 4:19:25.680]  Mr. Nader you're you've run for president before why are you running for president again?
[4:19:25.680 --> 4:19:30.400]  You know the control corporate press says oh the perennial candidate. Uh, why are you running for president?
[4:19:30.720 --> 4:19:33.920]  Because I want to improve my country. I want to help the american people
[4:19:34.320 --> 4:19:36.320]  I want to take the solutions off the shelf
[4:19:36.960 --> 4:19:41.360]  Which are great solutions to affordable housing public transit solution cleanup
[4:19:41.760 --> 4:19:48.640]  Uh solar energy and put them on the ground and give the american people more small business more entrepreneurship
[4:19:49.040 --> 4:19:54.880]  More rights as workers and the freedom to form trade union and to put our foot forward in the world
[4:19:54.880 --> 4:19:58.080]  Where the best of america is seen not napalm
[4:19:58.480 --> 4:20:05.200]  Cluster bombs to the israelis and more weapons of mass destruction sold to countries that are often run by dictators
[4:20:05.360 --> 4:20:10.880]  Who use this these weapons against their own people and we wonder why people in the third world hate us
[4:20:11.200 --> 4:20:14.160]  Well, we're glad that you're running for president. A lot of the viewers and listeners
[4:20:14.480 --> 4:20:16.480]  Out there as well and you look at the polls
[4:20:16.880 --> 4:20:22.880]  You see congress with its lowest approval rating in history gallup bull reported nine percent cheney's got a nine percent pleasure twenty
[4:20:22.880 --> 4:20:28.960]  Two percent the democrats are unpopular because you have the constitution the bill of rights the american people are all together
[4:20:29.200 --> 4:20:34.560]  On what they want. It's funny constitutional positions are happened to be very popular with the people
[4:20:34.720 --> 4:20:37.680]  But we have the two-party dictatorship going forward
[4:20:38.000 --> 4:20:44.400]  Uh, and certainly by running you are helping to inject real issues into the debate similar to what ron paul did on the other side
[4:20:44.720 --> 4:20:51.120]  Uh, of the spectrum, but almost meeting very close. Alex jones, you're one of the few radio doctorals that ever says what you just said
[4:20:51.120 --> 4:20:55.600]  What you are saying is let many voices be heard
[4:20:56.000 --> 4:21:03.040]  Let the first amendment be used by all american open up the debate process. Why are we limiting presidential base?
[4:21:03.040 --> 4:21:08.160]  We don't limit weather reports. We don't limit entertainment. We don't limit sport. That was my next question
[4:21:08.240 --> 4:21:12.720]  I want you are really here to bring attention to the fact that we have this corporate monopoly
[4:21:12.880 --> 4:21:14.880]  That's hijacked the public trust of the debates
[4:21:15.040 --> 4:21:20.320]  Can you speak with your particular expertise at that being locked out of debates that you were invited to even though
[4:21:20.320 --> 4:21:25.520]  National poll after national poll from 2000 wanted me on the debates. You can and on the debate
[4:21:25.920 --> 4:21:28.960]  They want more people on the stage than you know
[4:21:30.080 --> 4:21:31.040]  two
[4:21:31.040 --> 4:21:32.480]  major candidates
[4:21:32.480 --> 4:21:37.920]  That are basically spouting the same old slogans that they spotted weeks before on the campaign trail
[4:21:37.920 --> 4:21:42.400]  They're not really debates. They're parallel interviews and the debate commission is a private company
[4:21:42.400 --> 4:21:50.240]  Created 21 years ago to get rid of the league of women voters which sponsored debate controlled by the republican democrat party to this day
[4:21:50.640 --> 4:21:55.040]  They picked the format of the debate. They picked the reporters who will ask the question
[4:21:55.680 --> 4:21:59.520]  And naturally they know how to pick a bill. Well, it seems they're more scared of
[4:22:00.400 --> 4:22:04.720]  Letting a third party or an individual like yourself, you know, who has the gravitas in the history
[4:22:04.880 --> 4:22:08.800]  And it really challenged me in because more than ever the two party system is under threat
[4:22:08.800 --> 4:22:12.960]  They know the people are wising up to them. So there's no way they can let Ralph nader in there because if they did
[4:22:13.200 --> 4:22:15.200]  You can capture the minds of the people
[4:22:15.200 --> 4:22:19.680]  And you know capture their attention and their imagination and then we can actually get some change in this country
[4:22:19.760 --> 4:22:24.240]  nader gonzalez run the three major presidential base alex, it would be a three-way race
[4:22:24.880 --> 4:22:31.200]  The cnn poll has us a six percent and we would go up quite rapidly with tens of millions of people
[4:22:31.520 --> 4:22:37.680]  Finding out that we're actually running finding out what we're running on finding out that our rhetoric
[4:22:37.680 --> 4:22:45.680]  Is based on a record of challenging the big boys for 40 years for the health safety and economic well-being of the american people
[4:22:45.920 --> 4:22:53.760]  That's the nader gonzalez thinking that's the theme of our super rally during the democrat national convention week in uh, in denver
[4:22:53.920 --> 4:22:57.120]  And uh, that is coming up tonight. I only have two final questions
[4:22:57.120 --> 4:23:01.920]  I'd like you to give out your website different campaign information tell us about the incredible super rally tonight
[4:23:02.240 --> 4:23:04.960]  With yourself and of course some agonzalez val kilmer
[4:23:04.960 --> 4:23:08.880]  Uh, we have a jell-of-the-off rub. Nellie mckay, cindy shane
[4:23:09.360 --> 4:23:13.200]  Uh, ike riley, john penn and so many other maroo
[4:23:13.680 --> 4:23:21.040]  Agreed against the machine. Absolutely big fan of his that are coming up tonight. Uh, but uh, my my final question for you was this
[4:23:21.200 --> 4:23:24.000]  Did you uh, i should have asked this before they ever got a chance
[4:23:24.480 --> 4:23:27.600]  Did you see cyhur before that big media conference three weeks ago?
[4:23:28.000 --> 4:23:32.880]  And then the orca reported on but didn't give the details and his wide-out sources. We know how credible he is
[4:23:32.880 --> 4:23:34.880]  Uh, said the dick chaining
[4:23:34.960 --> 4:23:36.960]  Uh, a few months before
[4:23:37.200 --> 4:23:41.040]  Uh, right after they tried to stage that event in the straight up or moose between iran
[4:23:41.520 --> 4:23:43.120]  Uh, and iraq
[4:23:43.120 --> 4:23:45.840]  Uh, with a fake radio chatter tried to paint up
[4:23:46.160 --> 4:23:52.960]  Uh, wanted to paint up us boats like iranian blue control boats and have navy seals quote have a shootout
[4:23:53.520 --> 4:23:54.800]  between
[4:23:54.800 --> 4:24:00.080]  Larger us naval vessels as a false flag event a did you hear that and b what is your take on it?
[4:24:00.080 --> 4:24:06.960]  I think uh, the dick chaining is a multiple warhead criminal recidivist as vice president together with his
[4:24:07.520 --> 4:24:15.440]  President george august who violated our constitution our federal statutes and international treaties that we solemnly belong to like the geneva convention
[4:24:16.080 --> 4:24:19.680]  Second i would put it past him alex that he wants to create
[4:24:20.160 --> 4:24:23.280]  Something worse than the thomkin gulf
[4:24:23.840 --> 4:24:29.120]  Uh, so that he would really uh want to create some kind of warlike
[4:24:29.120 --> 4:24:33.520]  A move against iran in order to heighten the public
[4:24:34.080 --> 4:24:38.240]  And shut down dissent and win the election for the republican party
[4:24:39.120 --> 4:24:41.920]  So you think that's a real danger? I think it's very much a real good
[4:24:42.240 --> 4:24:48.720]  Should there be a congressional investigation immediately started or do you have any other ideas of ways to to draw attention to the fact that syr
[4:24:48.720 --> 4:24:51.040]  The most respected investigative journalist living right now
[4:24:51.520 --> 4:24:54.160]  Uh, except maybe yourself you've warned some of the ads
[4:24:54.160 --> 4:24:58.800]  Uh, what would come out and say this and and and and only he's over them and covered it
[4:24:59.200 --> 4:25:03.760]  The people in the pentagon alex are worried about dick chaining and the neoconservatives
[4:25:04.320 --> 4:25:06.320]  And the drum beat against iran
[4:25:06.720 --> 4:25:08.720]  And the drum beat against iran
[4:25:09.280 --> 4:25:14.720]  Uh, could get this country in a in a huge amount of trouble. This is bigger than iraq
[4:25:15.200 --> 4:25:18.000]  The streets of hormones could be blocked because that could do it
[4:25:18.320 --> 4:25:20.720]  Oil prices oil, uh, and and the prices
[4:25:20.720 --> 4:25:23.920]  of gasoline is eating oil and economies of the world
[4:25:24.320 --> 4:25:27.920]  So I think the democrats should make a declaration and say
[4:25:28.480 --> 4:25:36.880]  If push g makes a military move make a military move against iran without consulting and being cleared with congress under constitutional
[4:25:37.120 --> 4:25:37.920]  provision
[4:25:37.920 --> 4:25:42.480]  They will move immediately to teach them and not both of them in the house and convict them in the center
[4:25:42.640 --> 4:25:44.640]  And you would do that as president
[4:25:44.640 --> 4:25:50.560]  Well, sir, in fact the criminal laws apply to presidents and vice presidents when they leave office
[4:25:50.960 --> 4:25:53.840]  This is they apply conviction on watergate before board
[4:25:54.320 --> 4:25:58.560]  Pardon him and so both have declared these new powers that never existed in closing
[4:25:58.640 --> 4:26:01.840]  Tell us about the campaign websites and the big rally that's coming up tonight, sir
[4:26:02.000 --> 4:26:04.320]  Get on our email list with your vote for us or not
