[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:20.120 --> 00:23.440]  Alex Jones
[00:23.440 --> 00:32.560]  all right welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Monday January 21st 2013
[00:32.560 --> 00:40.320]  inauguration day of our well the second coming of our Lord and Savior according
[00:40.320 --> 00:49.560]  to the mainstream media yes all hail Obama all praise Obama and you made you
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.580]  may know something about history and by the way I'll give you a rundown of the
[00:54.580 --> 00:57.000]  guests we have coming up today is a hard-hitting show we've got a lot of
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.480]  breaking news a lot of hard-hitting guests as well but just this
[01:00.480 --> 01:05.800]  inauguration thing if you probably notice it throughout history the less
[01:05.800 --> 01:11.760]  legitimate a government is the more pompous and over-the-top the ceremonies
[01:11.760 --> 01:17.100]  are for its illegitimate leader and that's what we saw here today just a few
[01:17.100 --> 01:23.400]  minutes ago with the Obama inauguration a band playing all these people I'm
[01:23.400 --> 01:26.800]  surprised I didn't have stiff-legged soldiers marching around with the Heil
[01:26.800 --> 01:32.760]  Hitler type of sign going out there you know I'm surprised they didn't have 57
[01:32.760 --> 01:38.460]  Air Force jets and nuclear missiles on on vehicles rolling down the road and I
[01:38.460 --> 01:43.360]  mean anything you know people holding up the Emperor's fake invisible clothes I
[01:43.360 --> 01:48.040]  mean I'm surprised they didn't just go all out because it's so ridiculous that
[01:48.040 --> 01:52.880]  the complete illegitimacy of this government now and this Obama
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.920]  administration think about it if Ron Paul had been elected president do you
[01:57.920 --> 02:04.720]  think Ron Paul would have wanted all this this just pompous celebration of
[02:04.720 --> 02:13.320]  him no Ron Paul would say we don't need a party we don't need it just just
[02:13.320 --> 02:20.240]  all this show what we need is to have a quiet dignified confirmation that the
[02:20.240 --> 02:26.520]  Bill of Rights is alive in America today all we need is to not have a man in
[02:26.520 --> 02:30.840]  charge but principles of liberty in charge and there we go for those
[02:30.840 --> 02:35.800]  watching on prison planet TV a picture of the inauguration oh my gosh the
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.240]  draping of the flags this looks like something pulled right out of Nazi
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.920]  Germany I mean it is all put that back up on the screen guys and show me some
[02:44.920 --> 02:47.400]  more photos because I was actually driving in during some of this I didn't
[02:47.400 --> 02:54.160]  see it all this looks like a Hitler inauguration it it looks exactly like it
[02:54.160 --> 02:59.560]  you just change the flags to a different you know German Nazi Germany flag and
[02:59.560 --> 03:06.240]  that's it and the the postures of the people are the same the pompousness the
[03:06.240 --> 03:12.640]  arrogance is the same this is sick it is sick where this country is going folks
[03:12.640 --> 03:20.240]  and just to remind us Obama has been tweeting out now this morning saying I'm
[03:20.240 --> 03:24.880]  honored and grateful that we have a chance to finish what we started our
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.400]  work begins today he says that's a quote from Obama that he tweeted out our work
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.800]  begins today oh what what work let's uh let's talk about that the work of
[03:34.800 --> 03:39.560]  dismantling the US economy the work of destroying our jobs the work of
[03:39.560 --> 03:44.320]  essentially revoking the Bill of Rights the First Amendment the Second Amendment
[03:44.320 --> 03:47.960]  the Fourth Amendment the Fifth Amendment and of course completely ignoring the
[03:47.960 --> 03:54.200]  Tenth Amendment the work of turning our airports into Nazi police state security
[03:54.200 --> 03:58.280]  zones with naked body scanners yeah I know they say they pulled those but
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.760]  they're they're replacing them with all millimeter wave machines so the
[04:02.760 --> 04:05.440]  announcement that the TSA is pulling those scanners is a bit of a hoax
[04:05.440 --> 04:10.680]  they're just replacing them with other machines so what is Obama's work really
[04:10.680 --> 04:13.960]  in this country what has he done in the last four years that he's going to
[04:13.960 --> 04:19.640]  continue look at it take an honest look at what he has done without even
[04:19.640 --> 04:23.800]  thinking about political affiliation unemployment is up we've got 128 million
[04:23.800 --> 04:29.520]  Americans now living on the government dependent on the government and for some
[04:29.520 --> 04:34.320]  reason those people are still even allowed to vote why should people who
[04:34.320 --> 04:39.040]  are living on the government be allowed to vote to control the revenues of the
[04:39.040 --> 04:44.400]  taxpayers who are actually contributing to society why should the takers be able
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.640]  to control the outcomes of elections in a free nation it doesn't even make any
[04:48.640 --> 04:54.520]  sense anyway all that much more straight ahead plus some hard-hitting guests like
[04:54.520 --> 04:58.440]  I said and all the breaking news from today right here on the Alex Jones show

[08:20.320 --> 08:24.920]  Day and also Martin Luther King Day we've got comments on the inauguration
[08:24.920 --> 08:29.440]  as well as Martin Luther King and his desire to carry concealed and his
[08:29.440 --> 08:34.600]  support for the right of self-defense and I think by the way oh by the way
[08:34.600 --> 08:38.800]  this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Alex will be back tomorrow I'm just the
[08:38.800 --> 08:43.840]  fill-in host here and thanks for continuing to have me on everybody I
[08:43.840 --> 08:46.840]  appreciate your support I'm just here fighting for liberty that's it that's
[08:46.840 --> 08:52.240]  why I'm here so we've got a bunch of news coming up on gun control on the
[08:52.240 --> 08:59.680]  economy on issues like this one and the MIT I'm sorry a Harvard Medical School
[08:59.680 --> 09:06.200]  professor is seeking a quote adventurous woman to give birth to a Neanderthal man
[09:06.200 --> 09:11.960]  that they're going to implant in her body by reconstructing the DNA of
[09:11.960 --> 09:20.200]  Neanderthals how much more evidence do you need yet that we're violating the
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.920]  will of the Creator hmm it's not just GMOs with plants and corn I mean now
[09:24.920 --> 09:31.240]  they're gonna they're gonna actually try to have a woman give birth to a
[09:31.240 --> 09:34.640]  Neanderthal and then what what are they gonna do then what are you gonna what
[09:34.640 --> 09:39.120]  are you gonna do with the Neanderthal you're gonna make it president I mean
[09:39.120 --> 09:45.280]  what do you do with a live Neanderthal it's it's insane this is this is this is
[09:45.280 --> 09:49.520]  a violation of nature and it's going on from every angle but let me give you a
[09:49.520 --> 09:53.520]  quick rundown before I get too far into this coming up at the bottom of this
[09:53.520 --> 09:59.760]  hour we have as a guest author max velocity yes max velocity that is his
[09:59.760 --> 10:06.120]  call sign he's the author of this book contact a tactical manual for post
[10:06.120 --> 10:10.440]  collapse survival and the reason I'm having max velocity on is because he
[10:10.440 --> 10:15.840]  served in the British Army as well as the United States Army and he is now a
[10:15.840 --> 10:20.200]  US citizen but he's one of those rare individuals who has perspective from
[10:20.200 --> 10:25.640]  both the UK and the US as well as being well-informed on survival and the
[10:25.640 --> 10:29.240]  Patriot movement in the United States so that should be a fascinating interview
[10:29.240 --> 10:34.620]  don't miss that from max velocity in the next hour we've got Sheriff Denny
[10:34.620 --> 10:39.120]  Paimon he was on last week with Alex Jones he is that sheriff I believe he's
[10:39.120 --> 10:43.760]  from Kentucky if memory serves me correctly he's the sheriff that posted
[10:43.760 --> 10:47.680]  that famous now famous YouTube video where he was almost brought to tears
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.120]  talking about the founding fathers and the sacrifice that they made in order to
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.640]  bring us the liberty and the freedom that we are desperately trying to
[10:55.640 --> 10:59.360]  protect today and then in the third hour we're going to be joined by John
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.600]  Rapoport for a few minutes with some additional comments and updates on the
[11:02.600 --> 11:06.760]  psychiatric police state that has now been implemented in the United States
[11:06.760 --> 11:12.780]  but getting back to what is actually happening today and real quickly Lance
[11:12.780 --> 11:19.200]  Armstrong books are being moved to the fiction section of a library in
[11:19.200 --> 11:24.920]  Australia they've now decided that Lance's entire history is complete
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.880]  fiction yeah so they're moving them to the fiction section which seems
[11:29.880 --> 11:36.480]  appropriate but the real reason that I bring that up is because Barack Obama is
[11:36.480 --> 11:42.040]  the Lance Armstrong of politics think about that for a second why is Barack
[11:42.040 --> 11:48.320]  Obama the Lance Armstrong of politics well Barack Obama is a highly charismatic
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.360]  person he's a good-looking person like Lance Armstrong I know some of you might
[11:52.360 --> 11:56.760]  argue with me but I'm saying across the board a lot of people look at Obama at
[11:56.760 --> 12:01.280]  the way he speaks at the way he carries himself he has charisma so does Lance
[12:01.280 --> 12:05.600]  Armstrong they both got charisma but what else do they have in common they're
[12:05.600 --> 12:11.000]  both lying to you that's all they know how to do is lie and deceive in order to
[12:11.000 --> 12:16.760]  climb their way to the top of positions of power and influence they use the
[12:16.760 --> 12:23.040]  media to manipulate the public and they are indignant against their accusers and
[12:23.040 --> 12:28.480]  whistleblowers and they they say things like how dare they even suggest that that
[12:28.480 --> 12:33.860]  I was doping or that that or in Obama's case how dare anyone suggest that he was
[12:33.860 --> 12:38.800]  going to sign the NDAA the NDAA the National Defense Authorization Act which
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.880]  of course he helped write or his attorneys did his administration did and
[12:42.880 --> 12:51.840]  then he signed we have been infested infected with a culture of charismatic
[12:51.840 --> 12:59.040]  liars psychopaths sociopaths who all they know how to do is lie in order to
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.900]  get to the top they do not honor ethics they do not honor spirituality they
[13:03.900 --> 13:09.680]  typically don't believe in a creator they don't believe in the human soul
[13:09.680 --> 13:13.120]  they don't believe in an afterlife they don't believe in in judgment that any of
[13:13.120 --> 13:17.800]  us are ever going to be judged for actions all they know how to do is live
[13:17.800 --> 13:24.560]  as charismatic parasites living off the goodwill of people who are easily
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.520]  manipulated into supporting them that is Lance Armstrong in my opinion and that
[13:29.520 --> 13:34.160]  is Barack Obama in my opinion and I think I the one reason Obama is so
[13:34.160 --> 13:39.400]  dangerous is because he's so charismatic is far more charismatic than Bush ever
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.840]  was and she can't look at Bush and and say charisma no the the last person who
[13:44.840 --> 13:52.080]  had this kind of widespread charisma was probably Bill Clinton and also another
[13:52.080 --> 13:56.880]  highly accomplished liar these people are all liars and but they're
[13:56.880 --> 14:01.500]  believable liars they know how to lie with such apparent credibility that they
[14:01.500 --> 14:06.480]  sucker people into it even we had the the obama phone lady here sitting right
[14:06.480 --> 14:11.400]  there in this in this office what was the last week with Alex or the week
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.920]  before and she was not aware that Obama lied about raising your taxes she was
[14:16.920 --> 14:20.800]  not aware that Obama lied about not taking away your guns but once she
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.480]  became informed about that her position changed very quickly once she became
[14:25.480 --> 14:29.720]  aware of the truth she actually began to start questioning some of her own
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.720]  support for Obama so that's just one example of what happens when people
[14:33.720 --> 14:39.720]  actually collide with the truth you know the truth that Alex Jones says to them
[14:39.720 --> 14:46.440]  and by the way I think I'm going to try to approach this topic with with all
[14:46.440 --> 14:51.560]  seriousness I think it is time and this is my opinion this is not Alex Jones
[14:51.560 --> 14:56.320]  opinion this is not info wars opinion but I think it is time that we began to
[14:56.320 --> 15:02.680]  make a list of all those who are enemies of the Bill of Rights who are enemies of
[15:02.680 --> 15:07.480]  America anyone who has publicly advocated the stripping away of your
[15:07.480 --> 15:11.360]  Second Amendment rights or your First Amendment rights or who calls for the
[15:11.360 --> 15:15.800]  end the abolishment of the Constitution or who calls for destroying the Bill of
[15:15.800 --> 15:20.840]  Rights or forfeiting all of the rights that are granted to you under the Bill
[15:20.840 --> 15:24.680]  of Rights I'm talking about people on the news I'm talking about news anchors
[15:24.680 --> 15:29.160]  I'm talking about writers it's time we made a list now you might say what's the
[15:29.160 --> 15:35.200]  purpose of this list the purpose in my opinion should be eventually as the
[15:35.200 --> 15:40.080]  Patriots restore the Republic in America because I believe that's what's coming
[15:40.080 --> 15:45.880]  we must arrest these people on the list and strip them of their citizenship and
[15:45.880 --> 15:50.960]  here's why if they do not believe in the Bill of Rights and they would want to
[15:50.960 --> 15:55.160]  strip you of your Second Amendment rights then what right do they have to
[15:55.160 --> 16:00.720]  even call themselves Americans if they do not believe in your rights they
[16:00.720 --> 16:04.880]  forfeit their own so anyone who is out there speaking out against the
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.480]  Constitution speaking out against the Bill of Rights is technically an enemy
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.500]  of America if they do not believe in the founding fathers they do not believe in
[16:13.500 --> 16:18.200]  the very principles the philosophies the ideas that great that gave us the great
[16:18.200 --> 16:21.840]  abundance the innovation the freedom and the liberty to become the greatest
[16:21.840 --> 16:26.280]  nation on our planet if they do not believe in those things they are not
[16:26.280 --> 16:32.280]  Americans they are not Americans and they are trying to destroy America by
[16:32.280 --> 16:36.640]  turning it into a nation where none of us have those rights anymore where we
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.520]  don't even have the separation of powers anymore where the executive orders from
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.080]  one president whether it's Obama or some future president can override Congress
[16:45.080 --> 16:49.920]  and override representation and override public debate on issues that really
[16:49.920 --> 16:55.000]  matter to our day-to-day lives I say because I'm an advocate of non-violence
[16:55.000 --> 17:01.880]  I say we make a list now and we put these people on this list with the
[17:01.880 --> 17:07.960]  intention of having them arrested and stripped of their citizenship take their
[17:07.960 --> 17:13.520]  passports take their IDs put them on a list do not ever enter this land of the
[17:13.520 --> 17:18.480]  free again you are barred for life from the Republic of America have two ships
[17:18.480 --> 17:23.680]  waiting one on East Coast the ship on the East Coast sails to Havana you can
[17:23.680 --> 17:28.400]  get on that ship or the ship on the West Coast sails to North Korea you can get
[17:28.400 --> 17:33.920]  on that ship it's your choice because it's it's the land of the free so you're
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.440]  free to choose which ship you want to leave on and then we kick these people
[17:38.440 --> 17:43.320]  out of America we send a message that says if you're going to be an American
[17:43.320 --> 17:47.440]  if you're going to be on the media in America if you are going to have any
[17:47.440 --> 17:50.880]  position of power in America if you're going to be a member of Congress and
[17:50.880 --> 17:57.680]  vote on bills a member of the Senate then you must support the philosophies
[17:57.680 --> 18:03.280]  of freedom and liberty and justice upon which this great republic was originally
[18:03.280 --> 18:08.240]  founded and I want to put that idea out there with all necessary and justified
[18:08.240 --> 18:15.440]  force I don't mean violent force I mean dedication is what I mean because again
[18:15.440 --> 18:18.640]  this is this is the nonviolent way to do this there are some people out there
[18:18.640 --> 18:22.520]  that are maybe more radical that would say they should shoot those people I say
[18:22.520 --> 18:28.240]  no no we must operate with dignity we must operate with honor we must adhere
[18:28.240 --> 18:33.320]  to the principles because of being philosophically correct and of non
[18:33.320 --> 18:39.160]  violence because we are in the right we are in the right we have history on our
[18:39.160 --> 18:47.160]  side we have God on our side we have the Bill of Rights on our side and anyone
[18:47.160 --> 18:51.520]  who is an enemy of those of those fundamental philosophies rest assured
[18:51.520 --> 18:56.440]  they are an enemy of this nation and they must be they must be shown the door
[18:56.440 --> 19:01.520]  get out of America you traitors get out of America now today is Martin Luther
[19:01.520 --> 19:06.600]  King Day and I believe that Martin Luther King would agree with much of
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.480]  what I'm saying here maybe not all of it but I know that Martin Luther King was a
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.480]  man who espoused nonviolent solutions that he believed in the Second Amendment
[19:16.480 --> 19:20.920]  the right to self-defense he applied for a concealed carry he knew that his life
[19:20.920 --> 19:24.840]  was being threatened and he was correct that there are dangerous people that
[19:24.840 --> 19:29.400]  were trying to silence him so he wanted a firearm to carry for his own
[19:29.400 --> 19:33.960]  self-protection and he was right to seek that out if Martin Luther King were
[19:33.960 --> 19:39.720]  alive today I believe he would condemn the actions of Barack Obama he would say
[19:39.720 --> 19:43.600]  Obama you are wrong to take these rights and freedoms away from the American
[19:43.600 --> 19:47.120]  people including all the African Americans out there who have the right
[19:47.120 --> 19:51.320]  to self-defense to defend themselves against tyranny or threats of violence
[19:51.320 --> 19:54.920]  or anything that might threaten their own safety or the safety of their
[19:54.920 --> 19:57.920]  families or communities that's what Martin Luther King would say today I
[19:57.920 --> 20:01.480]  believe stay with us we'll be right back on the Alex Jones show looking back on
[20:01.480 --> 20:06.120]  2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like

[24:10.240 --> 24:15.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[24:16.480 --> 24:20.760]  welcome back this is Mike Adams the health Ranger filling in for Alex Jones
[24:20.760 --> 24:25.480]  today I'm the editor of naturalnews.com a frequent contributor to infowars.com
[24:25.480 --> 24:30.440]  and check out infowars.com right now and every day during the broadcast here
[24:30.440 --> 24:35.480]  as more news is being posted it seems like every hour there's a Kurt Nemo and
[24:35.480 --> 24:39.760]  Don Salazar are working very hard as well as other writers Paul Joseph Watson and
[24:39.760 --> 24:43.920]  other contributors to get to bring you the news that really matters now just to
[24:43.920 --> 24:49.440]  clarify during the last segment yes I did advocate creating a list of all of
[24:49.440 --> 24:54.320]  those people in America who are calling for the abolition of the Constitution or
[24:54.320 --> 24:58.000]  the Bill of Rights and then having those people arrested and stripped of their
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.880]  citizenship and deported from the country yes that's it that is exactly
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.440]  what I'm going for let there be no mistake and it makes perfect sense
[25:06.440 --> 25:11.800]  because they are traitors from within in fact think about it Obama today in the
[25:11.800 --> 25:18.160]  inauguration he swore an oath to defend the Constitution I mean how could that
[25:18.160 --> 25:23.040]  not be comedy hour Obama swearing an oath to defend the Constitution but the
[25:23.040 --> 25:27.920]  entire crowd should have broken out in bouts of mad laughter when when he swore
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.920]  that because he is the one destroying the Constitution but that that oath
[25:32.920 --> 25:38.560]  means you must swear to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and
[25:38.560 --> 25:43.200]  domestic why is that even in the Constitution because the founding
[25:43.200 --> 25:47.800]  fathers knew that there would be many enemies of America from within the most
[25:47.800 --> 25:53.080]  insidious kind enemies from within enemies of the Constitution enemies of
[25:53.080 --> 25:55.440]  the Bill of Rights enemies of the founding principles upon which this
[25:55.440 --> 26:00.040]  great nation was originally created which which gave rise to the abundance
[26:00.040 --> 26:02.880]  and the innovation and the freedom that made this the greatest nation in the
[26:02.880 --> 26:09.320]  world so why should we tolerate these enemies from within to run around our
[26:09.320 --> 26:14.360]  country and continue to try to destroy it why should we tolerate that we should
[26:14.360 --> 26:18.480]  arrest them we should kick them out again I'm an advocate of non-violence so
[26:18.480 --> 26:21.520]  I don't I don't think we should commit any violence to that I'm not saying we
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.440]  should throw them in secret prisons like Obama does I'm not saying we should put
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.000]  them on a kill list like Obama does I'm not saying that we should do what Obama
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.560]  does and launch unmanned drone missiles to kill innocent children that's what he
[26:35.560 --> 26:40.240]  does I'm not saying that at all I mean Obama is the king of violence he talks
[26:40.240 --> 26:44.520]  about protecting children from violence he's the one killing children with
[26:44.520 --> 26:50.200]  violence I mean it's it's such hypocrisy but why should we let these people run
[26:50.200 --> 26:54.560]  around and try to destroy our country from within we shouldn't we should make
[26:54.560 --> 26:59.600]  a list have them arrested give them a fair trial show the evidence of what
[26:59.600 --> 27:03.640]  they said on television what they said on CNN those people that said Alice
[27:03.640 --> 27:07.720]  Jones should be popped and shot with an ar-15 they should be arrested stripped
[27:07.720 --> 27:11.840]  of their citizenship and shown the exit shown the door you're out of the country
[27:11.840 --> 27:15.800]  buddy don't come back go to North Korea that probably have a place for you there
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.800]  I'm sure you could clean toilets in the gulag for Kim Jong-un yeah they might
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.520]  love that they might love that job that's what we should do with them now
[27:24.520 --> 27:28.600]  I've got a video all across the country over this weekend there were gun rights
[27:28.600 --> 27:34.320]  protests our Second Amendment advocation protests at state capitals everywhere
[27:34.320 --> 27:40.360]  and I've got a video here from this this is a short speech by Roger Saucier the
[27:40.360 --> 27:44.360]  one of the co-founders of the Connecticut Minutemen group and here's
[27:44.360 --> 27:48.400]  what he had to say on the on the Capitol steps of the state of Connecticut over
[27:48.400 --> 27:53.640]  the weekend fellow patriots I am here to support our second amendment right to
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.760]  bear arms which is provided to us by our Constitution but not just these rights
[27:58.760 --> 28:04.240]  only but for all the god-given rights that our government has no business
[28:04.240 --> 28:09.720]  interfering with who the hell are they to tell us that we can't have solved or
[28:09.720 --> 28:20.240]  20-hour soda or an ar-15 I only have one comment I will not comply
[28:20.240 --> 28:26.880]  yes I will not comply those are the words of Roger Saucier the founder or
[28:26.880 --> 28:30.760]  co-founder of the Connecticut Minutemen group and his words were reflected all
[28:30.760 --> 28:35.640]  across the country in dozens of other protests at state capitals by people who
[28:35.640 --> 28:39.640]  are fed up and who have had enough of the tyranny who've had enough of enemies
[28:39.640 --> 28:44.520]  of America operating from within trying to destroy the Constitution and the Bill
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.080]  of Rights they're trying to bring us to a civil war okay that's what they're
[28:48.080 --> 28:52.920]  doing they're trying to turn America into a war zone so that they can then
[28:52.920 --> 28:57.640]  launch their drones on Americans and they can then activate their kill lists
[28:57.640 --> 29:01.840]  on Americans American patriots returning veterans they're trying to take over
[29:01.840 --> 29:05.640]  because they're losing they're so desperate they're so desperate that look
[29:05.640 --> 29:11.360]  everything out there is a hoax the the media CNN will have 13 anti-gun guests
[29:11.360 --> 29:16.960]  on with only two defenders of the Second Amendment the polls that they show that
[29:16.960 --> 29:20.220]  the mainstream media shows are completely fabricated they'll delete the
[29:20.220 --> 29:24.120]  poll if the gun rights are winning or they'll change the numbers to make it
[29:24.120 --> 29:31.440]  look like people want guns banned the inauguration total theater everything is
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.180]  a hoax out there to try to make you think that the public supports taking
[29:36.180 --> 29:40.560]  away your Bill of Rights but it's not the case freedom is winning liberty is

[33:18.200 --> 33:23.160]  inauguration day January 21st 2013 this is Mike Adams the editor of natural news
[33:23.160 --> 33:28.840]  dot-com filling in for Alex today it's also Martin Luther King Day and we had a
[33:28.840 --> 33:32.840]  few comments about Martin Luther King and his advocation of gun rights for
[33:32.840 --> 33:38.400]  private citizens you know it's funny we got banned by Facebook a few weeks ago
[33:38.400 --> 33:44.200]  for posting a graphic where Gandhi was speaking out in support of self-defense
[33:44.200 --> 33:49.080]  because you know all human beings have a sacred divine right to defend themselves
[33:49.080 --> 33:54.520]  against aggressors and Gandhi understood that and we put that on a graphic and we
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.640]  put that out on Facebook and Facebook suspended our account yep and in fact
[33:59.640 --> 34:03.640]  Drudge linked to that story and it became quite quite a quite a bit of a
[34:03.640 --> 34:08.000]  story across the internet well Martin Luther King was also an advocate of gun
[34:08.000 --> 34:13.280]  rights so you've got these two people who history shows or at least mainstream
[34:13.280 --> 34:18.800]  history says these are the champions of non-violence of pacifism that they say
[34:18.800 --> 34:22.720]  you're supposed to just lay down and be obedient that is not what they said at
[34:22.720 --> 34:30.200]  all Gandhi only resorted to non-violence because his countrymen were disarmed if
[34:30.200 --> 34:36.360]  Gandhi had an ar-15 and his countrymen had an ar-15 they would have kicked the
[34:36.360 --> 34:43.680]  British out of that colony a long time many years earlier Gandhi had to resort
[34:43.680 --> 34:47.280]  to non-violence because that was the only thing left and even in his own
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.360]  writings the doctrine of the sword in particular the doctrine of the sword you
[34:51.360 --> 34:56.800]  can search that online he spoke of using self-defense to protect yourself or your
[34:56.800 --> 35:01.800]  brother or your family from aggressors who were intent on violence so don't be
[35:01.800 --> 35:05.520]  fooled into thinking that Gandhi or Martin Luther King only espouse
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.320]  non-violence no they knew that we have a sacred divine right to self-defense and
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.160]  they both understood the role that firearms play in protecting innocence
[35:15.160 --> 35:20.200]  from aggressors and that's why Martin Luther King's own house was described as
[35:20.200 --> 35:25.320]  an arsenal of weapons he had all kinds of guns in there because people were
[35:25.320 --> 35:30.640]  trying to kill him as actually happened he was right to be armed as are you
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.560]  because you never know what kind of bad person out there might be trying to take
[35:35.560 --> 35:40.920]  you out or take what you own or just commit random acts of violence that's
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.400]  why we need responsible upstanding citizens to be armed when they're showing
[35:45.400 --> 35:48.760]  that graphic there with Gandhi that we did post if you're watching a prison
[35:48.760 --> 35:53.000]  plant TV in any case changing the subject now we are joined by our first
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.960]  guest today his name is max velocity or his his call sign I should say and he's
[35:57.960 --> 36:01.960]  the author of this book contact a tactical manual for post-collapse
[36:01.960 --> 36:07.920]  survival now max velocity was born in the UK and he served in the British
[36:07.920 --> 36:15.160]  Army first before serving in the United States military and he has a very unique
[36:15.160 --> 36:20.520]  perspective therefore I'm serving in the militaries of both nations and a unique
[36:20.520 --> 36:26.040]  perspective on a nation that has strict gun control versus America which has gun
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.240]  rights and gun freedoms so you can find his books on amazon.com and everywhere
[36:30.240 --> 36:35.040]  else and we'll give out its website soon but max velocity joins us now welcome to
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.800]  the show max hi thanks very much for having me on it's a my pleasure to have
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.240]  you have you on you've just released a new book called Patriot Dawn that lays
[36:45.240 --> 36:49.960]  out a rather frightening scenario of what could happen in America can you
[36:49.960 --> 36:53.440]  give us a just a brief synopsis of what that book is all about and what you're
[36:53.440 --> 36:58.680]  trying to explore narratively through that work of fiction yes yeah sure
[36:58.680 --> 37:03.520]  really that book is a result of my personal journey as I came through the
[37:03.520 --> 37:09.280]  whole prepping thing to writing my own books and my own manuals trying to give
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.480]  people the tools to to be able to defend themselves initially you know when I was
[37:13.480 --> 37:18.540]  writing contact it was more of a collapse kind of situation and as I
[37:18.540 --> 37:25.160]  learned more it kind of also gave gives you the tools for you know perhaps a
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.520]  civil war resistance against the tyrannical government all the tools are
[37:29.520 --> 37:34.360]  in there and then I the reason I wrote Patriot Dawn was because it really came
[37:34.360 --> 37:38.080]  to my attention that the fiction is a good way of getting things across to
[37:38.080 --> 37:41.800]  people some people might not want to buy a manual it might have you know too
[37:41.800 --> 37:46.000]  technical that kind of thing tactics but so what I've tried to do with with
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.920]  Patriot Dawn is to prevent is to is to write about what I think is a very
[37:50.920 --> 37:55.740]  realistic scenario not that I expect it to happen exactly the same way that I go
[37:55.740 --> 37:59.800]  through in the prologue to Patriots Patriot Dawn it's just setting a scenario
[37:59.800 --> 38:05.100]  there's something I think you know may well be coming soon and by telling a
[38:05.100 --> 38:11.360]  story try and sort of probably tell it an interesting story but also to educate
[38:11.360 --> 38:17.320]  people in a little bit of tactics a little bit about what they might face
[38:17.320 --> 38:22.920]  what things they might be against and just to try and use that medium to get
[38:22.920 --> 38:26.440]  the point across well on the on the philosophical side let me ask you this
[38:26.440 --> 38:31.120]  you were born and raised in the UK you became an American citizen many years
[38:31.120 --> 38:37.320]  later what are your beliefs and philosophies on the Second Amendment the
[38:37.320 --> 38:42.480]  Bill of Rights the right to self-defense versus living in a disarmed society I'm
[38:42.480 --> 38:46.400]  I mean it's not a canned question I'm actually curious about what kind of
[38:46.400 --> 38:49.920]  contrast you see what are your thoughts on all that yeah well I mean I am a
[38:49.920 --> 38:55.440]  despite the accent I am a US citizen I consider myself a patriot I have sworn
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.360]  the oath on joining the US military and when I became a citizen I take it very
[39:01.360 --> 39:07.140]  seriously I joke a little bit I'm now here living in the United States I have
[39:07.140 --> 39:13.800]  an American wife and children and I I should almost be suing for breach of
[39:13.800 --> 39:19.760]  contract because I came to America before I came on so many years with and
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.280]  before and you know US military forces that kind of thing in place like the
[39:23.280 --> 39:30.120]  Middle East and it wasn't that much of a of a of a change to me to actually come
[39:30.120 --> 39:35.480]  and I mean associated with Americans for a long time before that so it wasn't a
[39:35.480 --> 39:40.040]  great culture shock to me I've taken it very seriously and I fully support the
[39:40.040 --> 39:45.440]  Second Amendment I fully support the Constitution although because of things
[39:45.440 --> 39:50.880]  like the UCMJ I have to be careful what I would say because for instance you
[39:50.880 --> 39:55.320]  know the commander-in-chief is the president and so therefore I have to be
[39:55.320 --> 40:00.440]  careful what I say but I will point out that that the when you swear your oath
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.600]  of allegiance you swear your oath of allegiance to the Constitution exactly
[40:03.600 --> 40:08.280]  not to a person but to the Constitution so what if what if someone violates the
[40:08.280 --> 40:12.720]  Constitution what is your allegiance to them well we see that all the time you
[40:12.720 --> 40:17.240]  see that people seem to be violating the Constitution and there doesn't seem to
[40:17.240 --> 40:22.160]  be anything any repercussions or consequences for that right it just
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.280]  happens all the time and you've got these instances like Benghazi you've got
[40:27.280 --> 40:32.680]  the you know the I forget the name of it you know the Mexican gun running thing
[40:32.680 --> 40:39.120]  yeah the the Sinaloa cartel are all kinds of different cartels a drug fast
[40:39.120 --> 40:43.720]  and furious operation that you know you see you know thuggery across the United
[40:43.720 --> 40:47.960]  States with police officers doing things unconstitutionally the TSA you've got
[40:47.960 --> 40:53.480]  lots of things going on unconstitutional and really something needs to be done
[40:53.480 --> 40:57.200]  about that and you originally asked me the question you know how you know how
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.640]  do I feel about how do I feel about it well having come from the UK and now
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.920]  being a US citizen I feel privileged to be in the United States and given that I
[41:06.920 --> 41:12.040]  started on this path planning for like a prepper planning for a collapse before I
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.480]  really got to the political side of it and started to wake up and see the
[41:15.480 --> 41:22.680]  dangers inherent in our own country the importance to me of having firearms
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.960]  whatever you want to call them weapons is one of them that you call it you have
[41:25.960 --> 41:29.000]  your personal weapon that's what it's called so I mean people use the language
[41:29.000 --> 41:35.000]  but you need those to be able to defend yourself against whatever may happen I
[41:35.000 --> 41:39.240]  feel privileged that should a collapse happen if I'm living in the United
[41:39.240 --> 41:43.040]  States I'll have the ability to defend my family if I'm living in the UK I have
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.480]  nothing well that's a good point so we are on the verge many people believe of
[41:47.480 --> 41:53.480]  an economic collapse a global cascading debt collapse of the trillions or more
[41:53.480 --> 41:57.920]  than a quadrillion dollars in derivatives which are of course you know
[41:57.920 --> 42:06.160]  fake fake constructs of mathematically inclined greed mongers or something yeah
[42:06.160 --> 42:11.560]  the point is the system it looks ripe for collapse what will happen in the UK
[42:11.560 --> 42:14.480]  if there is chaos and the citizens have no real way to protect themselves
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.920]  because they've all been disarmed well I dread to think about my family is still
[42:19.920 --> 42:25.240]  still living back there and I you know I I really don't know what they can do I
[42:25.240 --> 42:28.560]  mean I have family who's actually in the British military I would hope that they
[42:28.560 --> 42:32.120]  would get themselves onto the translation which at least has firearms
[42:32.120 --> 42:36.480]  to benefit you know and somewhere to actually you know protect themselves
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.000]  there is nothing most people can do and and this is one of the things you know
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.120]  you see these I have to mention the name Piers Morgan but you see these
[42:44.120 --> 42:47.840]  interviews and you know this British guy coming over and telling people they
[42:47.840 --> 42:51.080]  don't need a Second Amendment anymore but my experience is that the UK is a
[42:51.080 --> 42:54.800]  very violent society well yeah now that you bring it up let me bring up Piers
[42:54.800 --> 42:59.760]  Mordor and he joked about shooting rivals this is an article out of Daily
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.360]  Caller it says in England Piers Mordor joked about shooting I'm obviously
[43:04.360 --> 43:10.360]  invoking Lord of the Rings there Piers Morgan slash the Dark Lord Sauron
[43:10.360 --> 43:16.520]  Mordor joked about shooting rivals said homeowners who killed and said said
[43:16.520 --> 43:20.400]  homeowners who kill burglars should not be prosecuted so Piers Morgan was saying
[43:20.400 --> 43:25.360]  that he first he joked about shooting professional enemies and he wrote that
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.880]  he was a rabid fascist who wanted burglars tortured and quote after a
[43:29.880 --> 43:34.140]  decent period of cattle prodding testicle electrode treatment and slow
[43:34.140 --> 43:38.640]  gentle skewering over hot coals these are the words of Piers Morgan as
[43:38.640 --> 43:44.120]  published by Daily Caller what do you think about that well I mean the man's
[43:44.120 --> 43:47.040]  outrageous he basically got kicked out of the UK and now you know people trying
[43:47.040 --> 43:50.320]  to pull him from the United States and people in the UK don't want him back I
[43:50.320 --> 43:58.000]  mean he it's not really for him it's not really about banning a certain type of
[43:58.000 --> 44:03.120]  firearm or gun it's really about his real agenda is banning them all because
[44:03.120 --> 44:06.060]  he's a you know he's one of these these progressives you know these
[44:06.060 --> 44:10.560]  collectivists these statists and you know he's a he's a front man for all
[44:10.560 --> 44:14.480]  that so really you know his point I thought I'd forget who it was with I
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.920]  saw an interview on the internet someone was being interviewed by him and it made
[44:20.920 --> 44:26.280]  some very good points and he referenced it back to what the real meaning of the
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.600]  Second Amendment is which is you know to defend against tyranny you know it's not
[44:29.600 --> 44:33.200]  about being a hunter all those things are things that come out of the fact
[44:33.200 --> 44:38.440]  that you might have run firearms target on what it's really about and all he
[44:38.440 --> 44:47.480]  could do was just keep the region on this guy so you know it it just it's all
[44:47.480 --> 44:51.000]  on your site I mean it all comes in from so many different angles the kind of the
[44:51.000 --> 44:55.720]  demonization you know the full crime it's really just about pushing this
[44:55.720 --> 45:00.480]  agenda and to disarm you know the American population so that anything can
[45:00.480 --> 45:03.680]  be done to them well that's exactly it you got it you got to ask the question
[45:03.680 --> 45:09.160]  what kind of a nation or let's say this what is a government planning if it must
[45:09.160 --> 45:13.880]  first disarm the citizens so in fact there's a quote from the author of this
[45:13.880 --> 45:20.040]  book called the resistance to tyranny by Joseph P Martino and there's a quote in
[45:20.040 --> 45:25.920]  here that I believe goes any any any government that attempts to disarm its
[45:25.920 --> 45:32.040]  citizens is either a tyranny or planning to become one so you gotta ask what are
[45:32.040 --> 45:35.680]  they planning that they got to have everybody disarmed well exactly and I
[45:35.680 --> 45:38.560]  think you know you guys know a lot more about this I do I'm still on a personal
[45:38.560 --> 45:43.280]  journey of education with this but you're exactly right because why would
[45:43.280 --> 45:48.680]  America administration in America want to take away the Second Amendment and
[45:48.680 --> 45:53.320]  effectively disable the Constitution or you know revoke or get rid of the
[45:53.320 --> 45:58.360]  Constitution which is the thing that that makes America exceptional and has
[45:58.360 --> 46:03.680]  made America what it is right if you take away that Constitution then what is
[46:03.680 --> 46:07.480]  America anymore I mean they got rid of guns in Australia but they didn't have
[46:07.480 --> 46:09.860]  they weren't protected by Second Amendment right or you know a
[46:09.860 --> 46:13.520]  constitution so they just basically just they had a similar situation to Sandy
[46:13.520 --> 46:17.360]  hook and they just said right no more guns but think but think about all the
[46:17.360 --> 46:20.680]  details of this too we have an illegitimate president who doesn't
[46:20.680 --> 46:25.000]  qualify whose birth certificate is a total fake an absolute document fraud
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.720]  you know multiple layers copy and paste font resolutions differ and so on it's
[46:29.720 --> 46:33.920]  it's an obvious fake that that I I would I would debate that with anybody it's
[46:33.920 --> 46:38.160]  irrefutable and then we have an administration that runs itself like a
[46:38.160 --> 46:41.440]  tyranny invoking executive orders bypassing the separation of powers
[46:41.440 --> 46:46.960]  bypassing Congress which means bypassing representation and the the war of
[46:46.960 --> 46:50.960]  independence in America was fought in part over the lack of representation of
[46:50.960 --> 46:56.800]  the American colonies in the decision-making process in the UK so now
[46:56.800 --> 47:02.080]  we have the same kind of kingship and Obama was crowned king yet again today
[47:02.080 --> 47:07.120]  in another pompous ceremony that really smacked of you know the Fuhrer this is
[47:07.120 --> 47:12.320]  the same issue that we once fought a war over to get away from and to establish
[47:12.320 --> 47:17.160]  liberty that's how crazy it has gotten well my main worry here is that you know
[47:17.160 --> 47:21.320]  as the United States has progressed through its history from being the
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.320]  shining light with it with it you know the Declaration of Independence and
[47:24.320 --> 47:29.480]  Constitution the Bill of Rights now it's becoming basically the federal government
[47:29.480 --> 47:33.520]  is becoming there for its own sake and for whatever other agendas there might
[47:33.520 --> 47:41.480]  be and and it becomes you know it's just becoming another socialist state and
[47:41.480 --> 47:46.000]  it's just starting to do all the things that socialist states do yeah and about
[47:46.000 --> 47:49.040]  you know back to a previous point why would they want to disarm why would you
[47:49.040 --> 47:54.960]  possibly if as administration you were interested in what is best for Americans
[47:54.960 --> 47:58.400]  because we know that all these arguments about you know gun control are just
[47:58.400 --> 48:02.200]  specious it's ridiculous I mean you me you me can just say that we don't have
[48:02.200 --> 48:07.940]  to debate it between ourselves it's ridiculous so there is no real reason
[48:07.940 --> 48:13.120]  apart from agendas and you know thought police type stuff to really want to you
[48:13.120 --> 48:16.920]  know disarm Americans and and therefore so you disarm all the lawful people and
[48:16.920 --> 48:21.360]  then basically criminals have the guns and then the worrying probably even more
[48:21.360 --> 48:25.840]  worrying than the criminals having the guns are if there is therefore no
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.400]  defense against tyranny should and you know I say this because I have to but
[48:31.400 --> 48:36.940]  should an administration become a regime as I have it in my book become tyrannical
[48:36.940 --> 48:40.320]  nobody's got any defense I mean one of the criminals are going to fight it but
[48:40.320 --> 48:44.280]  I don't see that happening right now the people who got guns I think I think the
[48:44.280 --> 48:49.440]  the the brain damaged part of this in the minds of the radical left is that
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.160]  they cannot ever imagine a government becoming a regime because in their minds
[48:55.160 --> 49:00.160]  their hardcore belief is that government is the Savior government is the answer
[49:00.160 --> 49:03.840]  government provides solutions it never causes problems it only provides
[49:03.840 --> 49:08.440]  solutions and therefore how could a government ever murder its own people or
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.040]  commit genocide and I guess they just they have to you know dismiss all of
[49:13.040 --> 49:17.560]  human history to hold that contradictory belief but they managed to do that they
[49:17.560 --> 49:21.320]  can hold that contradiction in their brain little brain damaged you know
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.920]  minds I don't know how I don't know how I couldn't even fake like being a
[49:25.920 --> 49:32.400]  radical left you know anti-gun liberal I don't know how they do it I'm not a
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.360]  psychiatrist but I mean it seems to me that you know you get to that point
[49:36.360 --> 49:42.400]  where you're trying to push this agenda and so you're the you're the you know
[49:42.400 --> 49:46.200]  the progressive status who's in power you're the socialist whatever it might
[49:46.200 --> 49:50.120]  be you know your ideal might be communism whatever the exact agenda is
[49:50.120 --> 49:54.520]  but you therefore have enemies you may construct those enemies because you need
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.580]  enemies to push your revolution through but at the end of the day it's easy in
[49:59.580 --> 50:03.720]  their mind to justify the removal and destruction of those enemies look what
[50:03.720 --> 50:10.680]  happens in Russia and Nazi Germany or Stalin Russia well that's what it has
[50:10.680 --> 50:16.080]  become with Obama is is that his entire agenda is really just destroying his
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.640]  enemies it's not about helping America it's not about boosting the economy even
[50:20.640 --> 50:23.760]  it why should government even have the role of boosting the economy anyway
[50:23.760 --> 50:26.560]  government's not going to solve that problem it should be government get out
[50:26.560 --> 50:32.000]  of the way let innovation rise but but but Obama is focused on destroying his
[50:32.000 --> 50:40.240]  enemies and not doing anything really for America you didn't build that but
[50:40.240 --> 50:44.960]  hey Obama's been re-inaugurated and he's gonna do more he's gonna do more he gave
[50:44.960 --> 50:48.240]  us the phone and he's gonna do more stay with us max velocity we got to go to a
[50:48.240 --> 50:51.840]  break but we'll be right back after this break with much more straight ahead here
[50:51.840 --> 50:56.680]  on the Alex Jones show don't go away max velocities straight ahead we'll be right
[50:56.680 --> 51:04.040]  back if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but we're

[51:07.800 --> 51:11.760]  to want to miss this exciting message here's why our solar generators provide
[51:11.760 --> 51:16.400]  life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run
[51:16.400 --> 51:20.800]  quietly emit no fumes and produce electricity from the Sun so when the
[51:20.800 --> 51:24.880]  lights go out you'll always have the power you need now here's the best part
[51:24.880 --> 51:29.600]  every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as
[51:29.600 --> 51:34.680]  new we put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily
[51:34.680 --> 51:38.480]  at the end of each year we call them scratch and dent units but they're
[51:38.480 --> 51:42.960]  really just like this each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special
[51:42.960 --> 51:47.720]  bonuses you just won't believe don't wait they go fast go to scratch and dent

[54:48.640 --> 54:55.960]  about parsing words now isn't it Bill Clinton is is not is and Obama we're
[54:55.960 --> 54:59.680]  gonna do more we're gonna do more to erode the Bill of Rights and destroy the
[54:59.680 --> 55:05.200]  Constitution and we've given them four more years and I guess I guess enough of
[55:05.200 --> 55:09.560]  popular support to where they think they can try to get away with it but they're

[55:16.360 --> 55:21.680]  continuing with Max velocity the author of contact the author of Patriot Dawn a
[55:21.680 --> 55:27.620]  very interesting individual who has served in militaries of two nations the
[55:27.620 --> 55:33.000]  UK and the United States and also served as a contractor working alongside US
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.680]  military men in the Middle East Max you still you still with us there yeah I'm
[55:38.680 --> 55:42.320]  still here all right great so I wanted to ask you your thoughts since you've
[55:42.320 --> 55:45.760]  been you know in trenches so to speak with so many individuals in the military
[55:45.760 --> 55:52.840]  if an order comes down from Washington to say martial laws declared well here's
[55:52.840 --> 55:56.080]  how it would happen first the false flag attack is set off somewhere in a major
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.460]  u.s. city they blame it on gun owners they then declare martial law bring in
[56:01.460 --> 56:06.280]  the military violating posse comment a comment atis and have the military start
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.320]  kicking indoors and confiscating guns to disarm the American citizens do you
[56:11.320 --> 56:17.800]  think max that American military servicemen would engage in that behavior
[56:17.800 --> 56:23.240]  how or what percent would follow orders or what do you think might happen well
[56:23.240 --> 56:26.520]  Mike I'm not really sure about percentages but I did basically cover
[56:26.520 --> 56:29.600]  this topic in my book Patriot Dawn because I actually have you know
[56:29.600 --> 56:33.440]  resistance elements fighting against what I call regime forces and the way
[56:33.440 --> 56:40.280]  I've described it is I think it would be a split because some people are awake
[56:40.280 --> 56:46.160]  and some people aren't and some people come from different backgrounds so among
[56:46.160 --> 56:51.680]  the great variety of people in the United States military some of them come
[56:51.680 --> 56:55.480]  from strong kind of patriot families depending on what part of the country
[56:55.480 --> 56:58.800]  they come from other people don't you don't remember a lot of people are
[56:58.800 --> 57:05.480]  recruited to the military through the inner cities for instance yes so there's
[57:05.480 --> 57:09.440]  two parts this is really what the background is of of the people in the
[57:09.440 --> 57:13.120]  military the military reflects the society it comes from and so many people
[57:13.120 --> 57:18.000]  in today's society are not aware of and really understand things like the
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.640]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights we've got the whole push now you know
[57:21.640 --> 57:25.640]  for safety and security which is infringing upon people's rights and so
[57:25.640 --> 57:28.800]  you've got many people in the military who are similar to a lot of the people
[57:28.800 --> 57:33.000]  or even the entitlement class as we call them you know who are out there in
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.200]  America today the other side of it is is if you've got an active duty unit for
[57:38.200 --> 57:43.640]  instance that's sitting on a base if it's chain of command doesn't flinch
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.400]  and it just you know the orders come down and if there is you know an
[57:49.400 --> 57:54.480]  intelligence briefing that says you know this false flag attack is happening
[57:54.480 --> 57:56.880]  we're going to say it's a false flag attack but such-and-such has happened
[57:56.880 --> 58:02.120]  and there are terrorists and we have been ordered to deploy and do operations
[58:02.120 --> 58:06.680]  against these terrorists in the domestic United States a lot of people aren't
[58:06.680 --> 58:11.000]  going to question that well yeah that's how the manipulation will be done they
[58:11.000 --> 58:14.760]  would call gun owners terrorists can you stay with us for one more segment max
[58:14.760 --> 58:18.280]  we got to take a quick break yeah sure all right we'll be back in just a little
[58:18.280 --> 58:24.280]  over one minute with the final segment with max velocity author of Patriot Dawn

[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.840]  of the great things about what's happening right now is we really have to
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:45.080]  thank Obama and we've got to thank senator Feinstein from California we got
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.400]  to thank all of these gun grabbers were overreaching vastly overreaching they
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:57.280]  have made a tactical error they have awakened tens of millions of people to
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.200]  the reality that we are under siege by an illegitimate unconstitutional and
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.520]  perhaps even a criminal government and this is going to work in our favor and by
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.400]  us I mean Patriots I mean people who actually believe in America believe in
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.440]  the founding fathers and the principles upon which we were founded so they've
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:20.400]  overreached and Bill Clinton warned about that and just recently this is an
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.520]  article of Politico January 19 Bill Clinton says the Democrats don't trivial
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.520]  don't trivialize the gun culture a lot of these people he's talking about people
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.920]  who advocate gun firearms ownership private firearms ownership a lot of
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.360]  these people live in a world very different from the world lived in by the
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.920]  people proposing these things he means gun control measures I know because I
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.920]  come from this world yeah Arkansas there is a big gun culture in Arkansas there
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.240]  is in fact gun culture isn't even the right word it's a culture of liberty and
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.520]  self-reliance that's really what it is so max velocity continues with us in
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.160]  this segment he's our guest the author of Patriot Dawn and Max and like your
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.720]  comments on Bill Clinton's quote there about not trivializing the gun culture

[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.320]  max velocity tactical calm and I see that forwards to a blog spot page so
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.800]  very good link to the blog on there as well all right and not a lot not a lot
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.880]  of info on there yeah but I'm sure you'll continue to post but there are
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:31.800]  some pictures of you in action what is that a is that a saw a pull auto rifle
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.600]  there I think yeah much what you're going to but there's yet picture me with
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.240]  store yeah that was like that's pretty heavy-duty firepower you got there dude
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:46.800]  that's right is that is that what you have in your house now yeah those full
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.240]  auto kind of kind of pricey to get those these days yeah not too many private
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.960]  citizens with a saw all right no hammers that's a totally different story but not
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:02.080]  saws okay only gun owners will get that joke but go ahead sir with your comments
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.600]  on the on the bill Clinton thing about making the gun yes what do you think
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:15.520]  what do you think about that because multiple thoughts because yes I think
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.280]  maybe in their arrogance people at Feinstein have overreached but what
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.960]  worries me is I mean we were just talking before about how how military
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.320]  could be kind of persuaded to be used domestically against so-called domestic
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.640]  terrorists who might just be preppers or gun owners or whatever it is you know
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.040]  you have those those those pronouncements that people having
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.040]  waterproofed ammunition and more than seven days of food could be like
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:44.080]  domestic terrorists and ridiculous things like that what worries me is is
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:50.720]  at one point people are going to kind of stand up by which mean I actually may
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:54.040]  not do anything violent that's one of the dangers is that it might be some
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.320]  kind of false flag thing which is put onto you know this could be how it
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.440]  begins they've blown up somewhere or they've shot someone and these are the
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:06.080]  right-wing extremist terrorists right now we've got to calm down yeah well
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.600]  that's where we're fully expecting that to happen in fact I put I'd put money on
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.880]  that happening I'm sure they're working on it yeah and what I really mean is you
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.560]  know when people really gonna just stand up in a like civil protest because what
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.000]  worries me you see enough already of these these kind of these squat no not
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.880]  raid supposedly against the wrong addresses that kind of thing yeah and you
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:30.080]  know if they just start to take people down isolated people in different houses
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.360]  or little compounds or whatever whoever they decide to see is the new threat you
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.000]  know you get any kind of Waco chair Ruby Ridge sorry I forget the name yeah
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.840]  Ruby Ridge you know you get those kind of situations which which are appalling

[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.560]  with his comments I can only imagine what he's gonna have to say about
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:54.640]  today's pompous inauguration of the king Obama and everything else that's going
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.400]  on these days but we're gonna go through more news and then at the bottom of this
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.280]  hour we've got Sheriff Denny Paimon from Kentucky who is going to be joining us
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.200]  as a guest with an update on his thoughts on the Second Amendment the
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.160]  founding fathers and what's really happening to America in the meantime
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.600]  we're gonna we're gonna go over some news and I'd like to take some calls in
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.280]  the the second half of this hour so if you if you're interested in calling it's
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:28.560]  1-800-259-9231 yeah just making sure that's it 1-800-259-9231 all any time in
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.860]  the next 30 minutes or so and then we will start taking your calls about the
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:38.880]  Second Amendment or especially if you ever call for Sheriff Denny Paimon now I
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:45.240]  was just thinking during the break there how is it that these operatives in the
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:51.440]  Obama administration and in Congress how do they think that they're not gonna
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.060]  face their own sort of Nuremberg trial at some point I mean really do they
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:10:02.720]  because look all they've done is they've activated the Bill of Rights resistance
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:09.440]  to tyranny that was part of the DNA of America they've activated the DNA of
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:14.040]  America they've activated the culture of independence and freedom and liberty and
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:17.880]  they've grossly miscalculated Bill Clinton just pointed that out read that
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:22.240]  in the last break Bill Clinton says the Democrats don't trivialize gun culture
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:28.480]  basically he says you're not gonna make any headway by just dismissing the the
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:33.280]  pro-gun arguments he says the issue of guns has special emotional resonance in
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.600]  many rural states it's not just emotional residence it's survival people
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.000]  you live on a farm you live on a ranch if you don't have a rifle if you don't
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.520]  have a hunting gun if you don't have a shotgun you you can't succeed in farming
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:52.180]  believe me I know that because I live on a ranch and that many times that I grab
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:56.560]  a shotgun and rush outside and have to take care of something to protect our
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:03.240]  our animals or to investigate a strange noise from a wild animal or a strange
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.880]  sound or whatever many times you do that and if you're a farmer you need a
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:11.840]  varmint rifle you might need a hunting rifle a high-powered hunting rifle with
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:17.000]  like one-half MOA accuracy something like that to really reach out and you
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.560]  know long-range accuracy but how do these people in the Obama administration
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:26.040]  actually think and all these people on CNN that are advocating the destruction
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.720]  of the Constitution the destruction of the Bill of Rights do they not realize
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:36.200]  that they are admitting their guilt as traitors to America do they not realize
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.960]  that do they they they have no view of history they have no understanding that
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:47.620]  they've just admitted total guilt and I tell you what it's on and if if if the
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:52.720]  communists don't win if they don't take over the entire nation they're all gonna
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:56.160]  face trial all right I'm just I'm just putting that out there they're gonna
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.040]  face trial and may God have mercy on their souls because I'm not so sure that
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.400]  the citizenry will have mercy on them I'm always an advocate of non-violence I
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:09.040]  think people should have a fair trial I think we stick to the Bill of Rights we
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.120]  stick to due process we would give them what they would deny us which is a jury
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:19.640]  of their peers and and and due process see they would deny us the very things
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:25.160]  that we would grant them because we are the ones who occupy the moral high
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.800]  ground we are the we are in the right we have the philosophy the ideals upon
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:34.040]  which this nation was founded we would grant them a jury trial we would grant
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.080]  them the right to remain silent we would not try to take away their rights even
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.040]  though they try to take away ours and that's why we will be victorious because
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.760]  they will alienate the population if they try to conduct gun confiscation
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.040]  raids even by calling gun owners terrorists it won't take very long
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.880]  before those military bases find out that all their supplies are cut off
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.040]  because they depend on the goodwill of the citizenry to give them food and
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:06.040]  water and safe passage to and from the base to their homes as Paul Howe said in
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:11.360]  a in a recent piece that we talked about here last week or week and a half ago it
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.120]  wouldn't take long before any military personnel based in America who engage in
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:20.920]  gun confiscation and the murder of American citizens it wouldn't take long
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:26.520]  before their homes and their families were identified by resistance groups and
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.280]  they would start taking casualties so you're either with the Republic or your
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.200]  toast I mean to put it in simple slang you're either with the Republic or your

[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:59.080]  I just want you to know that I know a lot of you don't know me I grew up I
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.960]  played football one year in high school I ran track four years competitive
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:10.560]  athlete very high academic scores went into engineering school ended up with a
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.800]  degree in technical writing wrote software documentation found that a
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.800]  software company became a business innovator and ended up creating a
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:24.520]  multi-million dollar software firm that sold software to 20 20% 25% of the
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:33.760]  fortune 500 and found Liberty and the the need for Liberty in the 1990s on the
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:37.480]  tail end of the Clinton administration I began to see a beginner my eyes began to
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:42.000]  be opened to the reality of what was happening in our world and I gotta say I
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.320]  was in in in college I actually believed a lot of the liberal stuff I was
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.600]  indoctrinated by the public education system I was I was suckered into the
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.840]  Clinton charisma and I think a lot of people are suckered into the into the
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:04.240]  Obama charisma with the same thinking today I had to find Liberty myself I had
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:10.880]  to read and study and learn and become a defender of Liberty and teach myself
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:14.680]  history that the public schools wouldn't teach me so I didn't have the benefit of
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.840]  homeschooling I didn't have the benefit of private schooling I was a public
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.680]  school educated you know typical Midwest
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.240]  student and had to come out of that anyway enough about me I just wanted to
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.120]  give you a little background so you know where I'm coming from I come from the
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.240]  Midwest and I had to find Liberty on my own let's get to the other news the
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:39.240]  kindergartner has been suspended for bubble gum terrorism so that this
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.040]  kindergartner pointed a five-year-old girl pointed a bubble gum gun at a
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.880]  fellow student a Hello Kitty bubble blower and was then suspended there you
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.440]  go I also wrote a piece last night about
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:17:00.760]  nerf guns apparently oh my god you can buy on amazon.com a full auto nerf
[01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:06.280]  assault rifle that has 18 round magazines I mean high-capacity clips it
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:11.080]  comes with three of them 18 round magazines and it's full auto man I mean
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.440]  full auto nerf guns and they don't even have background checks required how
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:23.000]  dare Amazon sell full auto nerf assault rifles to children it's advertised to
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.160]  children the eight-year-olds no background checks no fingerprinting I
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:32.920]  can't believe it I so I I propose I propose that we have a new federal law
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:38.040]  that is called the nerf control act of 2013 and what we have to do is limit all
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:43.000]  full auto nerf guns to no more than seven rounds of ammo per magazine to be
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.680]  in compliance with New York and even if you have an 18 round nerf magazine you
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.960]  can only load seven nerf bullets into it otherwise you're a terrorist and you'll
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.960]  be suspended from your school or they'll make you wear an RFID chip like they do
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.480]  in San Antonio how wonderful is that nerf assault rifles yep soon soon our
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:05.360]  little kids will be arrested as terrorists or toting nerf guns alright
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:09.520]  Time Warner has banned gun ads continues to produce movies full of gun violence
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.240]  this is a story by Paul Joseph Watson up on infowars.com right now Time Warner
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.720]  bans gun ads any ad that shows a gun pointed at another person they're
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.440]  banning it but of course they're going to keep producing movies that show the
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.720]  total hypocrisy of all the Hollywood celebrities who've been calling for gun
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.080]  control who meanwhile star in all of these roles of pure blood and gore
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:36.360]  shooting people blowing their bodies apart on screen with massive splotches
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.200]  of blood striking the camera and dripping down the lens they love that
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:49.000]  but they want to ban ads now that depict guns pointed at people all right we've
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.560]  got this from prison planet.com actually it's from Lou Rockwell blog we've got a
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:57.520]  cartoon a weapon guide for the uninformed it's called guns guns and
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.720]  Obama for dummies and it shows how many people are killed each year by these

[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.640]  be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up

[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.240]  yeah we're back it's the Alex Jones show in four wars
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:24.240]  calm Mike Adams here filling in for Alex today we've just become aware of a new
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:31.560]  law being debated in the Senate SB 124 it turns parents into criminals if they
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:37.240]  fail to report to the school that they own a firearm so let me let me just run
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:42.720]  this down for you a parent has a child that goes to the school if the parent
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:49.240]  owns a firearm that parent must notify the school district that the parent owns
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.320]  a firearm within 30 days of enrolling the child in the school otherwise they
[01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.560]  become a criminal the written notification needs to include the names
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:02.720]  of the parent and any child attending the school and the fact that the parent
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.880]  owns a firearm so of course they're trying to create another database and
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.320]  they're going to discriminate against her child in the school so you're bad
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:17.480]  you're your mommy or your daddy owns a gun you're bad you're evil and they're
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.600]  probably going to then force that child into psychiatric care and then use the
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:27.200]  psychiatric diagnosis as a justification to take away your right to own a firearm
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:32.720]  so you see how this works it's all a catch-22 little scam now how is this
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:40.320]  gonna stop a kid like Adam Lanza from killing his parent and stealing her guns
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:45.520]  think about that I guess they're gonna have to charge the dead mother of Adam
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:52.240]  Lanza with a felony because it's her fault it's her fault that her son
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:58.120]  allegedly killed her and took her guns it's her fault I mean if if if your
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:00.560]  child kills you and steals your guns it's your fault they're gonna dig up
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:04.800]  your grave they're gonna dig up your body they're gonna throw you in handcuffs
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.640]  and charge you with another felony crime and probably have you as a guest with
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:12.440]  Piers Morgan just have a corpse right there talking to Piers Morgan just a
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:18.520]  corpse Piers Morgan would say to the corpse how dare you be a corpse I think
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.820]  it's just like zombie time total zombification of America but that law
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:29.600]  SB 124 is a I don't think it's on the floor of the Senate yet but it was
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:35.840]  sponsored by Chappelle and Nadal Nadal I don't know how you pronounce that those
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.040]  are the co-sponsors there you go SB 124 now you have to alert the school if you
[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:46.960]  own a firearm and if you have a child in school so one more reason to home school
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:51.880]  folks as if we needed more we got a guest coming up here in just a few
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:56.560]  minutes we've got Sheriff Denny Paimon he is the outspoken sheriff who is now
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.160]  famous for his YouTube video talking about the importance of the founding
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.640]  fathers and what they would want to to see happen in America today which is the
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:10.440]  restoration of the Republic and the rights of the people uninfringed so we'll
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.600]  have we'll have that sheriff on the show here in just a few minutes here's a
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:17.140]  quote from Bill Clinton this was mentioned last week by Aaron Dykes in a
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:23.520]  video Bill Clinton said and I'm not sure what year this is quote when we got
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.560]  organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.760]  radical Bill of Rights giving a radical amount of individual freedom to
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:37.600]  Americans this is Bill Clinton again it was assumed that the Americans who had
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.540]  that freedom would use it responsibly there's a lot of irresponsibility now
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:47.120]  and so a lot of people say there's too much freedom Wow well wait a minute
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:54.040]  mr. Clinton when we the people granted power to the government to have limited
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:28:00.760]  powers to run a few small things in the nation we assume that the limited
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:05.920]  government would use those limited powers responsibly but it didn't it
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:11.360]  became irresponsible it became oppressive it became a regime it
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:16.720]  bypassed the will of the people and has become a monster that is on the verge of
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.000]  committing genocide so to quote Bill Clinton that's a lot of irresponsibility
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.040]  and so a lot of people say there's too much government and when government is
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.920]  abusing our freedoms you have to move to limit it that's so that's the flip side
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.320]  of Bill Clinton's quote you see Bill Clinton was saying that oh my god there's
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.680]  too much freedom there's too much there's freedom everywhere freedom is
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.840]  flowing around it's it's out of control there's so much liberty it's just
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.560]  totally out of control what are we gonna do we're gonna have to limit the freedom
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:48.600]  he says but wait a minute the answer is government's out of control it's too
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.800]  much government in invading every little area of our lives how much water you
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:58.520]  could flush in your toilet how big your soda can be in New York and now you got
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.680]  to register your your guns if you if you have a kid in school if this bill passes
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.720]  I mean that government is intruding in every area of our lives I wouldn't be
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:12.880]  surprised if New York mayor of Governor Cuomo passed a law that said you can
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:19.120]  only use 2.5 square sheets of toilet paper every time you use the restroom in
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.520]  New York two and a half sheets and they would require toilet paper manufacturers
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:27.400]  to put extra perforations at the half sheet mark so that you can tear off
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:33.200]  exactly two and a half sheets without leaving a frayed edge which is not
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:38.000]  acceptable to the Mafia running the New York State Government two and a half
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.280]  sheets of toilet paper is actually that's what the Cuomo administration is
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:47.720]  probably worth after they're used we'll be right back straight ahead this is the

[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:40.040]  mostly is that they're ready to dig in they're ready to stand their ground and
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.640]  that's been that's been really exciting to see that there's still people that
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.840]  are willing to step up and to stand in the gap even for the people that choose
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:53.200]  not to the people that choose to are still staying in a gap running for their
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.920]  freedoms but for the freedoms of the people that that obviously don't
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:01.840]  understand what's happening right now so have you had a meeting with your
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.280]  deputies then where where it's very clear to everybody that you're standing
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:10.600]  your ground you're not going to disarm constituents in your county and so on is
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.920]  it is it clear to everybody now where you and your office stands yes it's very
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.280]  clear and the support that's come back from the community has just been been
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.880]  great sometimes when you make a stance like that you step out I mean I didn't
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.760]  ask anybody about it I didn't ask for a pole I didn't ask for the favor if it's
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:36.280]  gonna be good or bad I just went by my heart and the commitment that I made
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:41.240]  when I took an oath and the way I was raised and the things that I was taught
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.720]  in my home by my parents there was just no other response to have us but no it's
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:49.560]  just not gonna happen here well yeah yeah I mean you're exactly right this
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.960]  isn't up to a pole that's the whole point of the Bill of Rights is that this
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:56.640]  is the these things in the Bill of Rights are not subject to debate they're
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:02.200]  not subject to popular movements you you always have a First Amendment you always
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.800]  have a Second Amendment and so on they cannot be taken away from you no matter
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:09.960]  how unpopular they may become in any particular moment in history so you did
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:14.440]  the right thing you followed your oath exactly and that's what I think people
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.440]  are looking for I think a lot of people are still you know what's politically
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:23.600]  correct and what's you know gonna get me reelected or you know they have their
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:29.600]  own little hidden agendas as to their safe being but with me it was just the
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.480]  commitment that I had made in the the issues that I count to be important to
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.600]  me and to my family and the people around me and that's a that's a very big
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:44.680]  commitment is to you know uphold what has been given and handed down to us the
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.480]  price that others have paid that we might just even you know have these
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.520]  opportunities absolutely and also just from a a practical and perhaps even a
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:59.160]  tactical viewpoint if your population there your constituents if they were
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:04.000]  forcibly disarmed from some other method or if they turn in all their guns for
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.440]  some reason which I know they wouldn't do but wouldn't that put you and your
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:13.960]  deputies in grave danger responding to 911 calls because now you are you're
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:16.960]  going into situations where you don't have any help of firepower from the
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:22.440]  citizens exactly what I talk with citizens every day and we talk with
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:27.240]  those today one that had just come in and I've known this man to carry a gun
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:32.280]  for the last 15 years every day that I've been around him I've never seen it
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:35.780]  I've never seen his gun but I know every day that he has when I asked him if he
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:41.280]  had his his weapon with him easy as he did and you know if I'm out in a remote
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:47.240]  area and my closest backup is maybe 30 minutes away and I'm in a bad situation
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:53.200]  I should would like to see a citizen like that show up absolutely yeah and I
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:58.640]  should be hanging myself out to disarming you know yeah that would be
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:02.720]  crazy have you ever or has have any of your discussions gone into the area of
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:07.880]  let's say a possible financial collapse followed by civil unrest and then how
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:11.720]  your county might protect your community with the help of armed citizens has that
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:16.440]  ever entered your discussions at all not so much like an open discussions in a
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.920]  meeting or anything like that but just in coffee room talk yeah what people are
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:24.160]  saying what they're gonna do and you know you have a lot of people that you
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:27.920]  know do the home storage they get the food they get the water and they've been
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:32.240]  real good too but they're pacifist type people yeah and you know I understand
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.200]  that I respect their beliefs but I also know that that's the first place that
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:39.920]  they're gonna hit because they're they know there's no resistance there right
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.560]  it's so is that really fair to their family who they have you know proof you
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.320]  know said they're gonna provide for for the next year while we go through these
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:52.120]  situations these problems and to have somebody else marching to take this
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.440]  stuff out of their home that leaves them with nothing well there was there was a
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.760]  comedian I think it was I think it was Gaffigan who said this he said if if you
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:06.000]  store up a bunch of food and you don't have a gun all you've done is stored
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.720]  supplies for the biggest bully on the block exactly not not such a good
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:16.360]  strategy are you open to taking a few a few calls sure cuz I I would like to

[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:23.040]  them no I'm not an oath taker other than a keeper other than you know just from
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:29.840]  what I've heard about it but I take any oath that I say it's a promise it's
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:36.400]  very important to me well it's sworn go ahead caller sorry I guess I'm an
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:40.640]  over-the-road truck driver and you know I get called into the chicken coop or
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.600]  pulled over by the state patrol and it's very surprising because I you know things
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:48.800]  I learned from Alex I'll sit and question them when I'm sitting in the
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.920]  car and asking questions about the ammunition that the Homeland Security
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:58.160]  and these people are very much against Obama I mean for the most part and all
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.880]  the things that he's doing I mean that's good news I guess well your comments on
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.720]  that sheriff well for what you know for what I thought of the calls that I've
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:11.640]  had I've had from I've had from officers I've had from military people I've had
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:18.320]  from everybody that you can imagine but a lot of the officers and military people
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.080]  are saying when it comes right down to that where them having to come into my
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:25.120]  County and do that they said they won't do it yeah I'm very very good well thank
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:29.520]  you for your call Rick that was some some good questions sheriff I'm curious
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:33.720]  have you had any conversations at all with your senator Rand Paul I mean
[01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:38.400]  because I've talked with him and I've talked with his people we've we've had
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.880]  quite a few conversations already so it's been there's a lot of support there
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.280]  anything that you that's okay to share on the air about I mean ran Rand Paul
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.200]  has been very public about you know Obama being a king and how he's going to
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:58.720]  lead a resistance in the Congress against unconstitutional executive
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.200]  orders for example is there anything in those conversations that is okay to
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:07.160]  share with us publicly well just that we have the same beliefs that we have the
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.580]  same thing at heart that thing is that at heart is the Constitution and by
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:16.320]  serving the people that have put us in these positions that's really that's the
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:20.320]  only thing we can do in the position that he takes is being supported by
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:26.880]  everybody here yeah and I've had no opposition other than just be high
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:31.600]  regards for for Rand and all that that he's doing and all the people here to
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:37.720]  support him have you spoken with Sheriff Mack yes I have good good it is people
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:43.480]  like like you sure Paimon who are the key to victory of restoring the public
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:49.240]  in America and I'm sure you realize that but it's a you know it's really kind of
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.800]  sad in some ways because I've had some people come say oh you know you're
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:57.320]  really a hero and what it is it's not being a hero it's a responsibility of
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:43:00.880]  all Americans absolutely and it is something that should have never got to
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.240]  this point in the first place well that's what I said in the last hour and
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:07.400]  I know this is gonna be controversial but I said people who openly attack the
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:10.960]  Constitution and the Bill of Rights who are saying we should eliminate it they
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:14.480]  are enemies of America and we should deport them and strip them of their
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:23.640]  citizenship as far as I'm concerned yeah well you know Kim Jong-un needs some
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.960]  additional servants in his gulags so I'm sure a lot of those folks will be happy
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.520]  there let's go to another caller Joe in Pennsylvania with comments on the Second
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.560]  Amendment Joe you're on the air with Alex Jones show and Sheriff Paimon go
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.960]  ahead sir how you doing guys doing good um first of all I want to thank you
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.400]  sheriff what you're doing you know we need more public people people to come
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:51.040]  out in public like you are because I'm sure you know a lot of them are you know
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.720]  thinking the same thing but I think they need to go more public but one thing
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.560]  I've noticed on YouTube I think they're suppressing accounts on things because
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.040]  there's like tons of people that are you know they got these comments about the
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:13.480]  guns and they systematically do that yes yes and it's disheartening and also like
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:17.960]  on Facebook you make comments like this and people they just don't care they
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:23.280]  just care about cookies and football but I wanted to share I wanted to share
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:28.160]  something with you guys I'm sure you you've seen it before but if not I found
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:35.160]  a interesting video on YouTube it was published on December 15th of 2012
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:44.280]  Australia bans gun guns crime rate soars and they if you didn't see it it just
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:50.880]  shows how they all they're chopping up the guns and and the people they said
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:54.840]  the guy said if I the gun I have I have to keep it locked here it can't be
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.120]  loaded well let's let's direct that to Sheriff Paimon thank you for your call
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:02.680]  Joe but what would happen in your County Jackson County Kentucky if everyone were
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:05.960]  disarmed what would happen to the crime rate there in your view it would be it
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:09.520]  just go out out the roof I mean we'd have people coming from everywhere just
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.960]  to steal from here yeah well hey why don't but Sheriff why don't you just I
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:19.000]  got the solution for you you put a big sign on the road that comes into your
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.080]  county and the sign says gun free zone then you'd be protected right oh I'm
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:27.360]  sure absolutely I'm every good citizen would probably stop there and if they
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:31.040]  did have a gun rather than enter they probably turn around and leave and would
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.240]  not enter that zone if they were you know just a good good citizen that went
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:39.480]  by that but of course part of the problem is some of these criminals can't
[01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:45.520]  read because they're illiterate so they came to read gun free zone so that's why
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.200]  if they can read it it would work then they would just turn their guns in at
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:54.640]  the border I'm sure absolutely yeah the biggest problem with this is cold gun
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:59.480]  thing is everybody's I don't know what's happened to people's common sense you
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:04.760]  know you and me both brother I mean they're talking stuff that I mean it's
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:09.960]  just I would be ashamed to even have that come out of my mouth well it's it's
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:14.640]  this magical thinking they they think for example this is mostly from people
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.920]  who are not familiar with firearms they think that a rifle will leap out of the
[01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:23.480]  trunk of a car it will load itself it will turn its own safety off and it will
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:28.240]  engage in rapid fire as its own animated metallic object without any human being
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:31.840]  operating it that's what they literally believe well we tried to you know so we
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.200]  have something to back that up that's area we took a gun and we placed it in a
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:39.280]  room full of people but we hate it where nobody who knew it was in there but yet
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:43.000]  it was in plain view and we had people come and go we did that for several
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.720]  years and not one of those people ever saw that gun felt that gun that gun
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.600]  never bothered anybody so really we just we didn't know what to do after that
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:54.440]  well I'm pretty sure Obama would say that's an unscientific experiment you
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:47:03.400]  did not have a control group well they also believe I mean at the bottom the
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.240]  bottom line is all of us want to see less violence against innocence that's
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:11.320]  the goal that we can agree on what what we disagree on is how to get to that
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:16.640]  point and for some reason the gun grabbers think that if you if if the
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:21.040]  law-abiding citizens turn their guns in the somehow fewer criminals would use
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:27.320]  guns how I'm not how does that even make sense well you know I mean it's just I'm
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:30.800]  looking at the criminal side of it let's just say I'm a criminal and I'm gonna I
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.840]  picked out a school that I'm gonna go attack so I started doing my homework on
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:37.880]  the school and I realized the guy that went ahead of me to go to this school
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:43.400]  when he walked into the school guy come out from behind a desk and shot him you
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:46.480]  know he didn't get a chance to shoot anybody yeah chances are I'm not gonna
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.720]  go to that school that's right I have to look for another one well there you go
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:52.520]  another argument for arming some of the school personnel let's go to another
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:57.200]  call if you're okay Pat in Texas Pat welcome to the show you're on the air
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:06.320]  with sheriff Paimon go ahead sir I heard this mention lately but many years ago
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.840]  in Kennesaw Georgia they passed a law that you had to have a gun in your house
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:17.160]  law-abiding citizens didn't the crime rate drop 70% of criminal break-ins
[01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:22.240]  dropped 70% overnight good question are you aware of the stats related to that
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:26.160]  sheriff I have heard that but it wasn't here in our area because they didn't
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:32.760]  have to pass all like that people had it anyway yeah we're you know that's
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.040]  something that's just it goes back to the common sense thing you know all
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.560]  right well do you have a follow-up question Pat yeah I'm worried about that
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:47.320]  we you know like taking down the bullets and sail of the bullets away and where
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:52.800]  do you hide those I know Tupperware will hold things the waterproof I put
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:58.080]  matches and Tupperware and thrown it in the yard and two years later took them
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:01.400]  out and struck them now that's the old Tupperware the new Tupperware is
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.160]  microwave-proof but I was wondering how do you how do you stop them from
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:09.760]  detecting that with a metal detector the kind you go to the beach with and
[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:14.920]  I can answer that living on a ranch in Texas you throw all kinds of scrap metal
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.560]  all over the yard which is pretty much already there anyway if you live on a
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:23.600]  ranch you any any other thoughts on that sheriff that's the way it works though
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.240]  there's already there's bullets buried that they can dig them up years and
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:31.880]  years from now people have thought well enough they had advanced that even if
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.440]  they pass stuff today they're never gonna get all this stuff so yeah I tell
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:41.000]  you if if one of Obama's minions wants to run a metal detector over you know
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:46.880]  400 acres go for it that'll that'll distract you while we restore Liberty in
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.600]  the meantime all right let's go to another caller and thank you for your
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:55.320]  call Pat Mariah in Iowa Mariah you're on the air with Sheriff Paimon from
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:02.960]  Kentucky go ahead with your call how are you doing great hi Danny are you I'm
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:08.000]  doing all right I am in I have a question for you I need some clarity on
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.200]  it clarification with all this after the president signed these executive orders
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:19.560]  and everybody went into panic I know Alex had a few sheriff on don't know
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:25.820]  whether it was you or sheriff Matt I was just I'm in central Iowa I have my
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:31.800]  county sheriff ran solely the high-profile individual okay calling
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:36.080]  we're gonna have to go to break here real quick but please oh we're skipping
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.960]  it okay I'm sorry we're skipping this break go ahead with your question thank
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:43.240]  you thank you I really want to get this out in the open I think a lot of people
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:49.160]  are confused at what a share of what what is his duty when he is sworn in my
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:56.000]  this this sheriff of my county was like I said a high-profile individual he ran
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:03.240]  on his name he was just elected to the second term from his previous job your
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:06.120]  question is what were the responsibilities of the sheriff what the
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:12.720]  10th amendment I called him I want to know how he stood on the issue of when
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:20.040]  if federal officials were to come in does he have the right to say no you
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:24.680]  know these are this is my responsibility these are the people is that elected me
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:29.760]  well the short answer is yes but let's let let sure if I'm an answer that the
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.240]  sheriff is the highest elected official for law enforcement in your area it be
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:39.680]  if it be the county then that's the area where just like Kentucky we're a
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.440]  sovereign state they've tried to break that what's happened over the years is
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:48.880]  the states have given up rights and things to the federal government if you
[01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.000]  go back to the way the Constitution was made that there were all individuals
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.320]  just like they're trying to make decisions in Washington for the people
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:02.160]  in Jackson County all they can make is the decisions for a mass of people I'm
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:05.600]  gonna do a better job of or the people here are gonna do a better job of
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:11.000]  elected somebody that's going to provide for our needs here rather than something
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.160]  federal now the sheriff here know or the sheriff there knows your problems of
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:20.080]  situation of issues better than the federal people coming in the federal
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:25.160]  people can pass those laws but most most shares do not exercise the rights and
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.040]  authority that they do have because most of them aren't familiar with that's
[01:52:28.040 --> 01:52:34.180]  right that's right so a sheriff can say and if if this is passed by the the
[01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:38.680]  local voters a law that says let's say a federal agent cannot enforce an
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:45.360]  unconstitutional gun confiscation in the county a sheriff can legally stand on on
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:50.040]  the road with force and arrest those federal agents and that is all 100%
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:55.080]  protected under law yes I hope it doesn't come to that I would hope the
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:59.600]  feds would back down knowing what would be what they'd be facing but I think
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:02.960]  that's what the caller was getting that yeah well I think the way it's gonna go
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:05.440]  I don't think it would be the federal people come in to try to get the guns
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.240]  anyway because most federal people I've talked to believe the same way that we
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:14.480]  believe they swore an oath to the Constitution as well yes and I think
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:20.360]  it's gonna take outside of this this country bringing people in it that are
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.920]  actually the ones in the long run when it gets to the out to that point but
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.880]  this is the key is just don't let it get to that point listen if it in the bud
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:33.720]  right now and take control of what is already ours well I I agree with you
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:36.640]  hundred percent I know there are many very good men and women in the FBI for
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:41.200]  example even in the ATF in the DEA sometimes I criticize the DEA for their
[01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:45.280]  overreaching raids but you know it's there are good people in every branch
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:48.200]  just as there are bad apples in every branch but I think you're right there
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:52.480]  are enough good people to prevail but are you talking about like a red dawn
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:55.800]  type of scenario something really goes wrong and we have foreign troops in the
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:59.280]  country is that what you're yeah I think that's where your United Nations is
[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:03.280]  gonna play in effect yeah if something goes wrong somewhere else they send the
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:07.120]  u.s. boys over there something goes wrong here they're just gonna hold the
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:09.920]  u.s. boys back because they wouldn't do that they're not gonna go into some
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.000]  little woman's house that lives her closest neighbors two miles away and
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.600]  she's just there with her pets and the only thing she has is a ak-47 laying by
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:23.200]  her bed to protect herself I don't think they're gonna take it from her no no and
[01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:26.400]  they will have to use foreign troops but I got to tell you every hunter in Texas
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.240]  can hit a blue helmet at 600 yards so they're gonna they're gonna be in for a
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:35.920]  fight if that happens let's go to one more call Austin in Ohio calling in
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:41.040]  about the Obama inauguration Austin go ahead you're on the air sir how are you
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:47.720]  gentlemen doing today we're fighting for Liberty brother oh yeah I just wanted to
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:52.680]  speak my mind on something because this whole Obama inauguration it's just a
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:57.400]  complete hoax I'm just saying people around on social media and just
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:01.400]  everywhere in general just worship in this puppet kills kids with little
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:07.000]  drones and it's just completely ridiculous how they just worship a puppet
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.360]  who's doing all of this stuff and the sheep out here are just not doing any
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:15.680]  type of research out here and they're making all these biased comparisons to
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:19.360]  Martin Luther King and all these pictures and stuff and it's just
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:23.960]  completely demonizing and Austin let me let me let you in on something here that
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:28.120]  I'm convinced and sure if you'll find this interesting as well I'm convinced
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.080]  that about one-third of all of the Facebook accounts and Twitter accounts
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.120]  are run by advanced linguistic robots in other words code that's been written to
[01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:41.560]  act like real human beings you don't know that's even a real person so a lot
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:45.880]  of that stuff it's a completely like you said it's a complete hoax it's a theater
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:51.600]  reaction that's made to appear as if it were real sheriff directing the question
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:56.880]  to you and thank you for your call Austin have you seen some of this posts
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.640]  on Facebook about you that seemed to be sort of maybe there wasn't really a
[01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:07.880]  person behind it auto-generated type of thing yeah well they're out there the
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.360]  robots are running the online world and that's see that's the thing about local
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:15.040]  government when you spoke to your constituents on that YouTube video there
[01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.480]  you were in person face-to-face eye-to-eye that's real but this this
[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:24.680]  stuff on Facebook it's all it could all be a hoax we don't even know yeah very
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:28.600]  true that's why I say what you're better off and that's when the sheriff's on the
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:32.440]  level of the county level are gonna make a lot better decision for his good his
[01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.960]  people his constituents than somebody that's right federal people that's
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:41.000]  exactly right that's why they designed it that way are you I'm just curious by
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.680]  the way we need more people in positions of authority in in America people like
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.920]  you and I'm sure you've heard that and I know you're a humble person but have you
[01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:54.120]  have you ever thought about I don't know run for Congress and in in the state of
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:59.960]  Kentucky or taking on a position of more more influence well I have I've had
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.760]  people have talked to me a lot about that the last week and I've offered
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:09.480]  avenues to do that I I mean what I do is something like that I just have to pray
[01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:13.560]  about it and to see the direction there's nothing worse than to be out of
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:18.920]  the will of what God would have you to do I mean if my sole purpose in life is
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:23.940]  to be a sheriff in Jackson County and raise up some young men to go on and
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:27.400]  fill those positions and guide and direct them the best that's what I would
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:32.720]  do absolutely well that's that's the sense I get that you you are you are
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:37.860]  already a powerful influential person just by the truth in your voice the
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:43.980]  wisdom in your words and without even ever stepping foot in the House of
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:49.560]  Congress you are influencing minds right now in a positive direction that can
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:54.100]  influence generations to come well you know people came before us the
[01:57:54.100 --> 01:58:00.340]  generations before us were women that took a stand and upon that stand people
[01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:05.440]  reacted and moved with that and that's how we that's why we are we are today I
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:09.880]  can still look back into my child and people that helped bold me and its
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:14.880]  responsibility of us to hold that next generation I may never be in Congress
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:18.600]  but if I can mold a young man or young woman to go into Congress and to make
[01:58:18.600 --> 01:58:24.240]  the right decisions that are going to further benefit Liberty and our area
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:28.600]  here then that's what that's what I'm doing words of wisdom from Sheriff
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.960]  Sheriff Denny Paimon of Jackson County Kentucky thank you Sheriff for joining

[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:22.260]  which is what we're battling against today but I feel proud to be an American
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:27.560]  and I've lived all over the world I've lived outside the country I speak a
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:31.600]  couple of different languages I've lived in places where guns were illegal for
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:36.840]  citizens to own and I've seen what happens there and it's it is a tyranny
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:42.440]  it is oppression it's it's a nightmare and do not give up your guns America you
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:49.200]  do not want to live as disarmed slaves to a 1984 style Orwellian government that
[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:54.320]  demands your obedience you do not want to be in that situation all right we're
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.320]  into the third hour by the way and thank you for continuing with us I know today
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:01.320]  has been a pretty heavy day pretty serious a lot going on we have more news

[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.840]  an update on the psychiatric police state and in the few minutes that we
[02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:14.680]  have in this segment I'd like to continue with your calls and then we'll
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:17.960]  get into news in the next segment so callers that have been holding let's go
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.720]  to Stephen in Pennsylvania with comments on the Second Amendment Stephen you're
[02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:27.840]  on the air go ahead sir hi folks I was hoping to talk to the sheriff and ask
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:34.840]  him what his definition of is a gun a firearm and that's where I think the
[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:46.120]  solution lies in that the the laws that were passed were regulating firearms and
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:56.920]  if you look back to the original law the definition of a firearm is a I believe a
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:03.360]  rifle under 18 inches in length barrel or a 16 inches barrel length or a
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:09.200]  shotgun smooth more that will fire a smooth bore rifle that will fire
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:15.520]  shotgun type ammunition under 18 inches in length and they were able to pass
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:21.800]  that law according to my understanding was back in 1934 when these gangsters
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:27.120]  were going into banks and robbing banks and they could hide a short shotgun under
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.760]  their trench coat or whatever a long shotgun over 18 inches was very
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.080]  difficult sure so you're thinking they might be playing word games with us here
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:40.880]  and you know doing like a hoax ban on firearms but it doesn't technically
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:46.080]  apply is that what you're saying I'm saying explicitly a firearm is only a
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:54.560]  smooth bore rifle under 18 inches in length anything 18 inches or over as
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:04:02.080]  long as it has micro grooving in it rifle all pistols are not firearms not
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:07.360]  one single pistol that has a has rifling in it is not a firearm not one single
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.960]  rifle over 16 inches barrel length is not considered a firearm none of them
[02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:16.040]  are well that's that's a very interesting angle there Stephen I'm glad
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:20.960]  you brought that up I guess we'd have to get to some attorneys to help parse the
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:25.680]  language to see if there's any legitimacy to that but you know I'll
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:31.760]  take my one and eight twist barrel any day over a smooth smooth barrel right so
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:37.600]  I'm glad we have rifling otherwise we would not have range right we would not
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.840]  have some stable ballistics in flight so thank you for your call that's a good
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.640]  point we got to go to a quick break and straight ahead as we return here on the

[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:18.440]  rating in the first term some of the lowest approval ratings that we've seen
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:24.160]  in history except for perhaps Jimmy Carter CBS News political director Obama
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:28.520]  must destroy the Republican Party you see it's all about destroying the
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:31.920]  opposition not about helping America it's not about doing what's right it's
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:36.700]  not about making America a great nation it's about destroying the Republican
[02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:41.000]  Party and disarming your guns at the same time because of course that's that's
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:45.380]  one of the big goals out there remember he gave us a phone and he's gonna do

[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:17.400]  earlier this morning significantly smaller inaugural crowd expected that's
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:22.040]  old news now since that already happened Biden says he's proud to be president

[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:43.660]  a scoreboard back here how much news can we get through establishment media
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:52.920]  announces the second coming of Obama oh the Christ the king the Obama heil
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:59.080]  heil Obama Barack Obama the Lance Armstrong of politics the federal
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:02.680]  government now requires that we ask you the following personal questions this is
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:10.400]  from zero hedge and this is whoa whoa what is this if you if we fail to ask
[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:16.400]  these questions we are subject to I'm sorry I don't understand the context of
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:19.520]  this is Obamacare prying into our personal lives even more this is the
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:23.480]  danger of getting into the news stack you never know what's in there it's kind
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:27.560]  of like Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolates news is like a box of
[02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:34.720]  randomness Obama I did it as he was sworn in his daughter says good job
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:39.480]  daddy the president responded I did it because it's all about him yes no
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:48.480]  dignity no philosophy no history no principle no ethics all about Obama he
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:54.200]  gave us a phone he's gonna do more Tony Carlucci on prison planet calm the
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:58.080]  greatest way to dishonor Martin Luther King is to compare him with US President
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:03.320]  Barack Obama I couldn't agree more Martin Luther King a man a man of
[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:10.280]  substance excuse me a man of substance a man of principle a man who actually stood
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:17.560]  for the people versus Barack Obama a deceiver a lying person someone who
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:23.240]  knowingly fabricates things and says he won't pass the NDAA and then does says
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.640]  he's trying to help Americans and then he destroys the American economy destroys
[02:12:27.640 --> 02:12:32.240]  jobs come on there's no comparison and by the way I hope you know that that's
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.200]  that's proof that it's never about skin color around here it's about principle
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:40.960]  as Alex Jones says if there was a black president who protected the Bill of
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:46.120]  Rights we would love that guy we would all love that guy where is that guy we
[02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:48.460]  got to find that guy wouldn't that be great
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:54.480]  the quote Jamie Foxx how great is that to find a black president that that
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:59.640]  supports the Bill of Rights how great is that that's what we need but we haven't
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:03.720]  found one yet and we haven't found a white president that supports the Bill
[02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:08.820]  of Rights what am I talking about that would be great too that's Ron Paul you
[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:14.480]  know how great would that be to have Ron Paul in all right continuing and by the
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.400]  way John Rappaport will be joining us here in just a couple of minutes I think
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:20.520]  I'm finally starting to have fun here today I was I was kind of down in the
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:24.080]  first couple of hours not down but but serious you know I usually come in here
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:30.440]  more jovial joking around more flippant sorry to use those big words for those
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:34.880]  of you who are public school educated like I only the homeschoolers will
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:38.960]  understand that I don't have to look it up all right I'm just joking don't take
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:44.080]  it all too seriously folks Americans not in labor force has increased eight point
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:48.620]  three million eight point three million more Americans jobless under Obama thank
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:53.240]  you and he's gonna do more flu season fuels debate over paid sick time laws in
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:57.280]  New York they're trying to pass laws that would mandate companies to pay for
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.040]  for employees to stay home sick that way they're saying well they wouldn't come
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:05.760]  to work sick and spread the flu hey once you just give out vitamin D at work it's
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:08.760]  like a couple cents a day why don't you just give them some vitamin D and then
[02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:11.280]  they won't miss work and they won't get the flu and they don't even need the
[02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:17.000]  vaccine shot but no that just makes too much sense for America today another
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.560]  battle over taxes in the Washington Post the economic collapse says the sovereign
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.480]  debt bubble will continue to expand bang until the system explodes that's the big
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:32.240]  that's the big elephant in the room that people aren't talking about it doesn't
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:35.560]  matter who's in the White House this system is coming down coming down real
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:40.360]  soon and global debt collapse domino effect system leading to I mean isn't
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.240]  this probably why they're trying to take our guns because they know they're gonna
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:47.560]  have to declare martial law in the economic collapse that's what's going on
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.560]  I mean that's at least a reasonable assessment of what's going a couple more
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:57.240]  headlines here Nevada legislator Brooks arrested accused of threatening assembly
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:05.000]  leader why okay whatever California's Hispanic population to outnumber whites
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:10.320]  by the end of 2013 hey why don't we have a Hispanic president that supports the
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:13.680]  Bill of Rights that would be awesome too that would be great I don't care what
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:17.240]  skin color you are if you support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:21.400]  you're my hero that's all there is to it you could be you could be Asian you can
[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:26.080]  be Hispanic you can be Norwegian as far as I'm concerned you come here you

[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:42.260]  CIA drone strikes will get passed in the counterterrorism playbook officials say
[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:45.680]  yeah because the rules don't apply to the unmanned drone strikes that are
[02:15:45.680 --> 02:15:50.320]  blowing up little children hmm you want to end violence against children stop
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:56.720]  shooting them with missiles just a little bit of logic for those who don't
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.360]  yet get it fanfight outside Georgia Dome leaves one injured I think he got stabbed
[02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:07.800]  in the neck guess you got a band next there's no end there's no end to it it
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:13.080]  gets punched in the face you got a band fist right there band knives TSA toys
[02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:17.720]  with the surfs at Lou Rockwell blog saying it's retiring some of its porno
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.880]  scanners naked body scanners from the airports but as we talked about earlier
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:25.880]  that is a hoax because of being replaced by a millimeter wave scanners just
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:30.720]  another way to irradiate your body so that is the blow-through news cycle I
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:34.840]  hope we covered some territory for you there now joining us by Skype is John
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:38.900]  Rappaport with an update on the psychiatric police state in America let
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:42.880]  me give you a bit a bit of background on that the article that I wrote on this is
[02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:47.760]  that psychiatrists are now given judge dread authority to strip citizens of
[02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:53.280]  their constitutional rights just because they say so so John Rappaport wrote one
[02:16:53.280 --> 02:16:56.960]  of the first articles on this about the psychiatric police state in New York and
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:02.640]  now joining us is mr. Rappaport from no more fake news calm John any new
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:08.440]  developments in this realm of thought crimes in America well the thought crime
[02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:14.160]  aspect is the big one like that you pointed out in your article to me it's
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:18.080]  all an extension of all of the surveillance that's been building up
[02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:24.160]  over the last 10-15 years you know we've got the drones we can spy on you you've
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:28.080]  got smart appliances in the home that can tell where you are what you're
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:35.880]  doing we've got intercepts on all emails phone calls purchases we've got
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:43.520]  everybody under surveillance in America the only thing that was missing was what
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:49.600]  are you thinking that was the last piece of the puzzle well yeah that piece is
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:55.240]  being put into place because the psychiatrists are now the new high-priced
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:18:01.760]  predator drones of thought it's like psychiatric drones but the you know the
[02:18:01.760 --> 02:18:06.840]  real thing about this so if you think about it is that now they can set up a
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:12.520]  catch-22 where if you believe in the Constitution you're mentally ill if you
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:16.720]  think you need to own a gun there's something wrong with you so now just the
[02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:20.720]  mere expression of wanting to exercise the rights and freedoms that you should
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:25.960]  have under a republic gets you diagnosed with a mental illness classic
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:31.320]  catch-22 totally you're totally trapped as a patient although why you would want
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:36.440]  to see a psychiatrist in the first place is beyond me but yeah but John they're
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:39.240]  gonna mandate it that's the thing I mean right now we can say no but soon they're
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.760]  gonna mandate it well they're definitely gonna try and it's gonna be part of
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.280]  Obamacare and that they're gonna be many more occasions let's put it this way
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:54.600]  where they will be able to order you to a court-ordered psychiatrist for any
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:59.560]  reason they want to and then once you're there according to the New York State
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:05.560]  law has just been passed if the psychiatrist feels that you represent a
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:10.160]  potential harm to yourself or to others he has to report you to law enforcement
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:15.280]  at this point if you have a gun they come to your house and they take it
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:19.680]  whatever things they take and of course you can't buy another weapon but the
[02:19:19.680 --> 02:19:25.960]  point is who hasn't ever had some kind of thought not an action but a thought a
[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:31.920]  moment a fleeting moment of anger the ideation of violence against some other
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:36.040]  person or some organization you know your boss at work whatever getting to
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:40.440]  because the psychiatrist is in charge of making that assessment yeah but I mean
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:43.760]  everybody's had some kind of fleeting thought that doesn't make you criminal
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:47.760]  saying he just does all right we're gonna go to break we're gonna break it
[02:19:47.760 --> 02:19:50.360]  we'll be right back after this continuing with John Rappaport and the

[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:24.520]  already and there's more yet yet ahead for us here broadcasting from Austin
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:28.480]  Texas this is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex Jones today Alex comes back
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.840]  sometime today and he'll be here running the show and run his show tomorrow so
[02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:37.120]  I'll be listening in that's the one thing that I don't like about hosting
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:41.080]  the show is I don't get to hear Alex do the show I mean I actually like to hear
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:47.160]  other people's thoughts on these things and and Alex is great at understanding
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:51.520]  the historical context and the angles that you don't normally think of right
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:24:55.000]  away so I was like his analysis I'm sure he's got it I'm surprised he hasn't
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.200]  called in guys he must be he must be out of cell phone range because he often
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:02.440]  calls in with some additional comments in any case we've got John Rapaport
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:06.880]  with us right now from no more fake news.com with comments on the
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:14.080]  psychiatric police state in America so John it looks like psychiatrists who
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:18.360]  were actually part of the problem and their drugs the drugging of children
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:23.240]  they're they're perhaps the largest contributing source to the problem now
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:26.960]  they're going to be put in control and given more power in reaction to the very
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:31.440]  problem they caused the school shootings yeah they're totally off the hook now
[02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:36.680]  nobody is going to take up the question in the official media of all these drugs
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:41.200]  that cause people to kill other people like Prozac and Zoloft and so forth
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:46.080]  that's all going to go by the wayside completely but let me run down what was
[02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:49.040]  going to happen in the office you see psychiatrists are sitting there the
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.800]  patient comes in psychiatrist says so what's the problem the patient begins to
[02:25:53.800 --> 02:25:58.280]  talk and the psychiatrist is going to inject at some point and say well what
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:05.360]  about your fantasies have you ever had thoughts of say getting revenge well
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:11.000]  yeah sure against whom I said well what thoughts did you have well I wanted to
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:15.880]  destroy you know well I had a dream what's about destroying the school
[02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:22.000]  where I went you know when I was nine years old I see now at this point you
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.840]  see you're done because the psychiatrist can now file a report saying potentially
[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:34.120]  a harm to others is talking about blowing up things and so we need to see
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:37.680]  if this guy has a gun and all of a sudden this guy gets a visit at his
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:41.040]  house and says what are you talking about I was talking about a dream I had
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:45.640]  when I was nine years old we don't care about that get out of the way when it
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:49.920]  starts the house and you're on the list and bah bah bah bah bah it's now as you
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:54.360]  wrote a thought crime and this is how the psychiatrist brings it out of a
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.800]  person you could do it I could do it anybody on the street could do it you
[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:04.000]  just engage in a little chitchat and say have you ever had any you know thoughts
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:09.440]  about violence I mean we all have certainly well sure I once wanted to
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:14.240]  blow up the planet I remember we were drunk at a party we're talking to all of
[02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:19.920]  a sudden you're done you're a thought criminal huh no more rights yeah that's
[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:24.680]  it that's that is exactly what it is coming to John Rappaport and you know
[02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:29.800]  the problem with this is that I mean these kids most of the school shooters
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:35.000]  right they have been bullied as children I mean many in many of the cases they
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:38.860]  were bullied and they go back to the school to take revenge on those who
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:43.280]  bullied them powered by the psychiatric drugs that the psychiatrist has given
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:47.040]  them so in their minds they do have an anger they do have a revenge but that
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:51.320]  alone is not enough to trigger the trigger it's got to be the drugs that
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:55.360]  separate them from reality that really makes it go over that takes it beyond
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:27:59.880]  the realm of ideation or imagination into the realm of taking action and at
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:03.320]  that point the shooters feel like they're in a in a dream state or a video
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:07.480]  game they don't feel like it's real so that's what the drugs do but you know
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:13.200]  now go ahead this has been pointed out a conversation that I had some years ago
[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:19.360]  with dr. Peter Bragan who is the conscience of psychiatry that not only
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:24.760]  do these drugs like the SSRI antidepressants and other psychiatric
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:30.920]  drugs even like Ritalin or Adderall push kids over the edge into actual homicide
[02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:38.680]  but they can also stimulate as he told me grandiose plans for destruction so
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:43.840]  it's just immediate impulse this is let's get to the blueprint blueprint the
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:49.400]  drawing board let's paint the scenario here let's work up the whole scene on
[02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:54.800]  how we're going to do this these drugs also promote that kind of behavior in
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:29:00.320]  kids that yeah they feel angry but ordinarily would do nothing absolutely
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:03.640]  maybe Eric Holder is on these drugs you know maybe maybe the people in
[02:29:03.640 --> 02:29:08.160]  Washington who are plotting conspiring to overthrow the Bill of Rights and
[02:29:08.160 --> 02:29:11.080]  disarm the American people maybe they're on these drugs I think a lot of them
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:18.800]  must be you bet and why don't we know let's have a list what drugs god forbid
[02:29:18.800 --> 02:29:23.080]  the list is going to be incredibly long is Joe Biden on what lists are all what
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:27.520]  drug is Joe Biden not on are you kidding me dude that is so far gone
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:32.480]  you know president Biden all the people in the House of Representatives in the
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:36.960]  Senate what drugs are they on what prescription drugs what drugs everybody
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:39.840]  we gotta we gotta go to break John sorry to cut you off we gotta go to break but
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:43.480]  good questions what drugs are our politically our elected political
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:47.600]  leaders on there there cuz a lot of them are smoking crack I think we'll be right

[02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:26.920]  solution to any problem could be solved by having less government never never
[02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:31.920]  the solution is never less government the solution is never more individual

[02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:46.120]  possible multiple shooters we have the government proposing new new solutions
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:50.440]  always involving taking more power away from you and putting it into the hands
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:54.240]  of the very people who are causing the very problems under which we are all
[02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:58.360]  suffering and in this case is the psychiatrist and John Rappaport joins
[02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:04.160]  us continuing he's the creator of no more fake news dot-com and to lead off
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:09.360]  this section and we will take some calls to this section in the segment John
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:13.760]  here's here's what I want to hit you with right now it used to be that
[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:20.160]  psychiatrists and psychologists were at least they were advocates of the patient
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:23.440]  or at least they pretended to be you know they were in your corner they're on
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:28.240]  your team trying to help you solve your problems with confidentiality you know
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:31.840]  you can tell me anything tell me what's wrong you tell me your greatest fears
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:37.000]  your fantasies your challenges will help you solve it that's been that's been the
[02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.720]  marketing line of psychiatry and psychology now it's different where
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:46.320]  snitches for Obama or stitches for the government whatever you tell us and in
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:50.420]  private conversations we're going to fill out a report and send it to the
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:54.400]  feds and they're going to use that to take away your rights now they are the
[02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:59.000]  secret police the psychiatrists are secret police snitches for the
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.320]  unconstitutionally operated federal government is am i am i wrong about that
[02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:07.520]  or is that what it's come to it's absolutely right and the American
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:12.280]  Psychiatric Association has just issued a statement applauding the whole move
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.880]  toward greater gun control so they're patting themselves on the back because
[02:35:16.880 --> 02:35:21.300]  they're saying yeah we like this niche role that we're in now we think it's a
[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:27.840]  good idea and even the psychiatrists who are less insane than the other
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:31.420]  psychiatrists think about what they're going to go through they're sitting
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:35.680]  there with a patient who says to them you know I'm very angry at my father I
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:38.560]  mean that's a statement that a psychiatrist heard you know maybe
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:43.120]  100,000 times in his career but all of a sudden this guy is going to stop and
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:48.800]  think hmm what happens if I don't report this patient exactly and then later he
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:51.940]  goes out and he kills his father that's exactly it they're going to report every
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:56.280]  little thing then to start cover themselves I'm done so I'm going to
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:00.840]  report everybody and everything that I possibly can so essentially the only
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.520]  thing you can say to a psychiatrist now is oh life is great everything's
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:08.760]  wonderful everything's fine peachy no problem when and if you're going to say
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:13.040]  that why go to a psychiatrist I just want one of those that you've got I mean
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:17.320]  I feel great but I think I could feel a little better and I've ripped out Prozac
[02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:21.520]  maybe you could you know write me a script that's all they want to say and
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:25.320]  the psychiatrist actually thinks that's great well of course yeah they're good
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:28.660]  they're getting the kickbacks and everything dispensing drugs and if they
[02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:33.800]  can shrink an appointment down from a half hour to ten minutes are they going
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:37.000]  to run more people through every day yeah you're right nobody's going to want
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.560]  to say anything but now sure fine no problem but the bigger point here is
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:48.100]  that we have ignored we I mean the nation has ignored the problem what
[02:36:48.100 --> 02:36:51.800]  causes the outbursts of violence that result in fatalities of innocent
[02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:57.460]  children psychiatric drugs a culture of violent movies and video games perhaps
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:01.400]  plays a role but definitely psychiatric drugs so Obama didn't mention
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:06.320]  psychiatric drugs in any of his 23 executive orders psychiatrists are given
[02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:10.720]  more power by any account we're going to have more school shootings because we're
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:15.800]  going to have more psychiatrists giving out more drugs to people who refuse to
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:18.460]  address the real issues they're having because they don't want to tell the
[02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:22.160]  truth now because the psychiatrist is going to snitch on them no question
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:25.540]  about it they're going to be more of these killings and murders because more
[02:37:25.540 --> 02:37:29.380]  of the drugs that cause the killings and murders are going to be dispensed but
[02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:34.280]  here's another factor that shows you where Obama's head is really at if he
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:38.260]  really wanted to end gun violence in America he would stand up at the podium
[02:37:38.260 --> 02:37:43.660]  and he'd say look at this map folks this shows you where the gun violence is
[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:47.740]  taking place in America where the people are being killed in greatest numbers and
[02:37:47.740 --> 02:37:54.360]  who's committing the crimes gangs for example cities these are the facts we
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:59.520]  have to face them because my motivation as your president is to end gun violence
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:04.980]  and therefore this becomes our new mission did he do anything faintly
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:09.380]  vaguely resembling that of course not because it's not gun violence that he
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:14.220]  wants to end it's gun ownership that he wants to have a good point yeah and also
[02:38:14.220 --> 02:38:18.620]  your approach is logical you know you you want to look at the causes of the
[02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:22.200]  thing you're trying to stop but you got to understand I know you understand this
[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:27.140]  but I'm speaking to the listeners Washington doesn't want logic they want
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:33.020]  an emotional and invocation of an irrational emotional knee-jerk response
[02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:38.020]  that doesn't stand up in any kind of actual critical thinking they just want
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:44.380]  you to react and the reaction is blame an inanimate object blame a gun refuse to
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:48.500]  look at the psych drugs that altered the mind that pulled the trigger that shot
[02:38:48.500 --> 02:38:53.820]  the child you know you it's like you're asking you're asking people to think and
[02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:57.720]  in America today that's too much apparently at least on the on the
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:01.780]  radical left you can't ask them to think they're not supposed to think they're
[02:39:01.780 --> 02:39:05.340]  supposed to react they're supposed to leap to conclusions and they're supposed
[02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:11.100]  to worship their king Obama who's gonna do more and it's all for the children
[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:16.860]  keep that of course yeah high-fiving the kids even though these drugs that are
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:19.940]  going to be dispensed in greater numbers than ever the psychiatric drugs that
[02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:24.700]  cause violence and murder are going to result in more children being murdered
[02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:29.260]  that's not part of the argument that's not something we think about that's too
[02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:33.940]  logical we can't approach that what we just have to keep saying is it's all for
[02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:38.280]  the Sandy Hook children that's why we're taking everybody's guns it's totally
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:42.860]  irrelevant doesn't make any sense but that's the emotion of the moment yeah
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:49.260]  and look at Obama's logic he said if we can save one child's life then I think
[02:39:49.260 --> 02:39:53.780]  he said something like we owe it to ourselves to try what he means is any
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:58.340]  any cost in society is worth reducing one death well by that logic we should
[02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:04.660]  ban all swimming pools ban all trampolines ban all automobiles in fact
[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:09.900]  you should ban being born yes I guess they do with all their abortions but
[02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:14.700]  they should ban childbirth because that can result in a child dying so therefore
[02:40:14.700 --> 02:40:21.020]  ban childbirth that's Obama's logic ban thought ban all thought because
[02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:26.020]  obviously thought precedes action and some actions result in harm so let's
[02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:29.860]  have a drug that the psychiatrist can give us that will stop people from
[02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:34.180]  thinking all together and then that will be the final solution we just have
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:37.940]  zombies around the landscape and everything is wonderful yeah what is
[02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:41.820]  something's drugs called guys throughout a sci-fi movies there have been lots of
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:45.500]  different names and and and fiction also different names for these drugs that
[02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:50.140]  that quote normalize the range of human emotions and thought I like the movie
[02:40:50.140 --> 02:40:55.820]  the island with Ewan McGregor that's a great film to review right now because
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:40:58.780]  of the medical police state that were under and I believe they were all on
[02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:04.300]  drugs there and that in that movie as well and give it a false reality to tell
[02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:08.020]  them a fairy tale so that they wouldn't resist and that's what we're seeing
[02:41:08.020 --> 02:41:11.860]  right now with sandy hook also speaking of that John I want to take a call from
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:16.140]  Robert in Georgia who apparently has comments on sandy hook of the Second
[02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:21.260]  Amendment so Robert in Georgia you're on the air go ahead sir awesome thank you
[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:26.380]  very much for taking the call and I've got a lot of my heart the floppiness I
[02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:30.820]  mean I thought I was living about 9-eleven and here you have sandy hook
[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:36.020]  and not one person down there not one child died I've been researching it it
[02:41:36.020 --> 02:41:41.180]  is anybody died down there if you continue looking at the research and how
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:45.500]  they've done all that they don't nobody's died they're actors I'm not
[02:41:45.500 --> 02:41:49.900]  kidding you they are actors down there and this is the worst one I've seen it's
[02:41:49.900 --> 02:41:52.300]  just let me stop you for a second so I just want to make sure understand your
[02:41:52.300 --> 02:41:56.260]  position so you're saying that there were no children died at all in sandy
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:42:02.660]  hook no sir I've been honest for hours on the end and then people were actors
[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:06.740]  and you can go down there we need to get a phone number going down there to
[02:42:06.740 --> 02:42:11.660]  Connecticut and Sandy Hook and start calling them police officers well no I
[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:14.860]  look look I I want to say I agree that there are a lot of questions about
[02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:17.980]  sandy hook and John I want your comments on this as well they haven't shown the
[02:42:17.980 --> 02:42:21.500]  video footage for example I'm convinced that there was no ar-15 used in the
[02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:27.140]  shooting whatsoever I I haven't perhaps investigated as much as you have caller
[02:42:27.140 --> 02:42:31.060]  but I'm very skeptical of the idea that nobody died there but I but it's a good
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:34.020]  question to raise we should always ask questions so John what are your thoughts
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:38.540]  on that on that scenario that the caller is explaining well I just wrote an
[02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:43.940]  article about this this morning but you know these people have unearthed
[02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:49.420]  tremendously interesting video clips of interviews with survivors at Sandy Hook
[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:53.940]  and they look like actors some of them I've seen right yeah you place on it
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:59.100]  yeah is is a that's under question but there's no question that what we're
[02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:05.300]  looking at here are people who have been in one way or another programmed out of
[02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:10.060]  being able to feel genuine human emotion in the midst of a horrendous tragedy
[02:43:10.060 --> 02:43:13.860]  let me go back to the caller because I Robert what what in your mind is the
[02:43:13.860 --> 02:43:17.780]  best evidence that exists today that that as you say no one was killed there
[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:23.420]  okay Robbie Parker and for one when the news channel does it they use your
[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:27.620]  proper name Robert my name's Robert my family used to call me Robbie for him
[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:32.580]  to call this fellow Robbie Parker and not use his real name and he's laughing
[02:43:32.580 --> 02:43:37.220]  and cutting up and then you know if you haven't seen it yet I've seen it yeah
[02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:42.660]  it's said in all of the interviews there is no remorse and one thing here I want
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:47.980]  to really stress is that truth is not threatened by a lie but a lie is
[02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:53.260]  threatened by the truth and I hope that they're just getting so sloppy on this
[02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:59.100]  it's gonna be exposed people if I was living about 9-11 this is literally sick
[02:43:59.100 --> 02:44:03.780]  and I was in surgery that day that morning on the 14th I was going to
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:07.940]  surgery and it started all happening and I could tell it right from there things
[02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:13.260]  were really bad I wish I lived in that area so I could ask people I know I mean
[02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:17.260]  I mean caller in one sense you're right that we can never really know what is
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:23.320]  theater could they stage something like that with all actors theoretically
[02:44:23.320 --> 02:44:27.460]  possibly but there it seems like there must be real people out there who lost
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:32.300]  real children or maybe I don't know maybe I'm still being suckered in I John
[02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:35.820]  your thoughts I mean how do you know what's true that's the bottom line well
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:39.780]  this is the point because everything comes through television right how do we
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:43.820]  know there are only certain people that are going to be interviewed for example
[02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:50.300]  anybody any parent who is outraged angry about the investigation who wants to get
[02:44:50.300 --> 02:44:55.060]  to the bottom of it who is close to being actually catatonic because they
[02:44:55.060 --> 02:45:02.540]  have lost a child who was really killed who is incredibly angry at the press for
[02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:05.860]  trying to approach them for an interview in the wake of the death of their
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:09.740]  children none of these people are going to be interviewed on television you're
[02:45:09.740 --> 02:45:15.660]  not going to see that and so right but we see is this section of people that
[02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:20.660]  appropriate for the scenario that's being created by the major media that
[02:45:20.660 --> 02:45:25.420]  is independent of what actually happened there in Sandy Hook and so we get this
[02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:30.340]  entirely insane picture of who these people in Sandy Hook are and plus we've
[02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:34.020]  got all the tie-ins with actual fiction theater you know the Batman movie the
[02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:37.900]  Sandy Hook on the map with the strike zone circled right around it it actually
[02:45:37.900 --> 02:45:42.380]  looks like the school on the map in Batman and you know I'm not saying okay
[02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:45.340]  maybe it could be coincidence but you get enough of these and it starts to
[02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:49.340]  become very suspicious and that's that's where I am on this folks is asking
[02:45:49.340 --> 02:45:53.100]  questions I haven't reached all the conclusions or anything but asking
[02:45:53.100 --> 02:45:56.500]  intelligent questions is what we're supposed to do members of the press are
[02:45:56.500 --> 02:46:00.940]  supposed to ask questions but we've got CNN and others just actually just shoving
[02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:05.740]  ideas down your mind without asking any questions that's what I'm that's what I
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:09.660]  have trouble with there's a difference between a staged event that actually
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:15.820]  happens you know people are killed but the perpetrator is not the person that
[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:20.740]  is blamed by law enforcement in the media that's a whole scenario that I've
[02:46:20.740 --> 02:46:26.300]  explored in depth that Lanza was not actually the shooter he was a patsy then
[02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:29.700]  you have the idea that nothing happened at all that the whole thing was a
[02:46:29.700 --> 02:46:36.180]  gigantic hoax and nobody died for which I would see personally no real motive if
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:40.860]  people would go that far in staging an event they would have no compunction
[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:46.700]  about actually killing people right adults whatever well it's like the I
[02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:49.260]  think Larry Pratt said this if they would stage Fast and Furious they would
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:53.580]  stage anything but for example in the the Gabrielle Giffords shooting in in
[02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:58.220]  Arizona I was able to actually make a phone call to a close personal friend of
[02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:05.900]  of Gabby and to verify sort of what went on I actually was a distant friend of
[02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:10.060]  Gabby she was a wonderful woman by the way just just a wonderful representative
[02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:14.540]  for the people there even though she was in the Democratic Party she was just a
[02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:18.380]  very wonderful person and so I you know I'm convinced that you know that
[02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:21.580]  shooting took place there's no question about it the question is what what
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:26.300]  caused that shooting but in Sandy Hook we don't have one well-known person that
[02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:30.860]  we can call and confirm I mean it there are way too many questions that we can't
[02:47:30.860 --> 02:47:35.220]  confirm it and I personally don't know anybody in that area to confirm it maybe
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:41.860]  I don't know maybe somebody can call in and and phone lines are open 1-800-259-9231
[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:46.460]  if you've got proof one way or another or the other on Sandy Hook how about
[02:47:46.460 --> 02:47:50.500]  that let's put that out there and we'll jump to your calls first fair enough
[02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:54.540]  sound good John sure all right cuz I know you want to get to the bottom of
[02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:58.340]  this too but yeah absolutely I mean look I've looked into Robbie Parker to the
[02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:02.340]  degree that there are articles about him in Utah newspapers like the Deseret News
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:08.780]  that he wants his family is from there that he had a family that this guy is
[02:48:08.780 --> 02:48:14.420]  not just some actor that they brought in from you know the sky to portray
[02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:20.420]  somebody that doesn't exist at all right so you know got to think about this
[02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:28.020]  if you had a group of 15 or 20 or 50 or 75 actors that were brought in to stage
[02:48:28.020 --> 02:48:32.300]  a complete hoax don't you think that somebody out there in the world who
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:37.300]  actually knows one of these people and said hey you see that guy who's supposed
[02:48:37.300 --> 02:48:42.220]  to be a fireman or a cop or a parent that's Marty don't you remember Marty we
[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:46.900]  went to school together I gotta put up a YouTube about Marty this is ridiculous
[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:50.820]  don't you think that would have proliferated by now unless somebody's
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:56.100]  going to say no these hundred people were you know kidnapped 50 years ago or
[02:48:56.100 --> 02:49:02.420]  20 years ago and they were raised you know they're raising a psych ward no I
[02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:08.380]  look I I suspect I suspect the real story here is kids were killed but they
[02:49:08.380 --> 02:49:12.860]  were killed by multiple shooters who were put up to this and that's why they
[02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:16.460]  they killed Adam Lanza at the end so he couldn't talk that's what I suspect very
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:21.060]  similar to Aurora because I know you know a lot about guns I mean for a while
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:26.580]  there and I still think they're saying that Lanza killed himself with a
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:31.780]  rifle well yeah you can do that yeah is that an easy thing to do is to turn a
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:35.820]  rifle around on yourself well I mean the other kids did it in the what the zero
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:38.540]  day shooting they did that right on camera in a school they put the rifles
[02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:42.300]  on the you know the butt stocks of the rifles on the ground vertically and then
[02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:45.740]  they just put their chins over the rifles and and or a shotgun in one case
[02:49:45.740 --> 02:49:50.180]  I think and pulled the trigger so yeah they kids know how to do that I mean if
[02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:54.620]  they're violent like that psychotic kids then they can do that well I agree with
[02:49:54.620 --> 02:50:00.980]  you I think so far from everything that I've seen this kid was a patsy and there
[02:50:00.980 --> 02:50:06.060]  were professionals who did the job and that opens the issue up completely to
[02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:13.100]  the whole aftermath which is grab the guns yeah yeah clearly that it whether
[02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:18.660]  it was real or or or staged the issue is that it was a justification to take the
[02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:22.460]  guns and that makes no sense now I want to go to some more callers after this
[02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:28.140]  break that's coming up here so William and Cindy and can stay on the line there
[02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:32.220]  we'll get to you right after this break that is coming up shortly and John

[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:41.860]  doing here we're asking questions about Sandy Hook and if asking questions is
[02:50:41.860 --> 02:50:48.300]  bad then America is lost okay this is the job of the media CNN should be
[02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:52.460]  asking questions instead of towing the party line all right the mainstream
[02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:56.660]  media should be asking questions instead of leaping to wrong conclusions let's
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.220]  ask questions and find out what really happened a lot more straight ahead stay

[02:54:06.020 --> 02:54:09.500]  GCN radio network
[02:54:09.500 --> 02:54:20.900]  in regards to that last call I think we have to be very cautious if we are to
[02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:25.220]  have any credibility whatsoever in questioning the official story of events
[02:54:25.220 --> 02:54:29.820]  like Sandy Hook we've got to be careful and I am that caller probably have good
[02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:33.620]  intention and maybe he knows more about it than I do I'm not sure but we have to
[02:54:33.620 --> 02:54:40.780]  be careful not to leap one bridge too far so to speak otherwise we all get
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:45.560]  painted as as as complete loons we have to ask good questions look for what we
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:50.260]  can actually substantiate where is their video evidence for example with the ar-15
[02:54:50.260 --> 02:54:53.980]  rifle not being used in the shooting there's they haven't released any video
[02:54:53.980 --> 02:54:58.140]  footage why wouldn't they release video footage if the kid was carrying an ar-15
[02:54:58.140 --> 02:55:01.340]  around shooting kids they would love to release that footage so we can say
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:05.700]  logically and rationally as skeptical journalists the fact that they haven't
[02:55:05.700 --> 02:55:09.460]  released that footage probably means they don't have it that's a rational
[02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:13.220]  thing but we got to be careful not to go too far and there's there are also
[02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:17.700]  agents of disinfo out there that try to get us to go one step too far to make us
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:21.620]  look stupid I'm not saying that was that caller that caller sounds like he was he
[02:55:21.620 --> 02:55:29.500]  was informed in his research and was putting forth what he believes but we
[02:55:29.500 --> 02:55:32.020]  just have to be cautious is all I'm saying let's go with what we actually
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:37.400]  have evidence for and not allow anyone to pull us one step too far down the
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:42.260]  road of of things that didn't really necessarily happen so so John what are
[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:45.380]  your thoughts on that I mean can't we there's a lot that we could actually
[02:55:45.380 --> 02:55:51.220]  like on 9-eleven there's so much evidence that building 7 was taken down
[02:55:51.220 --> 02:55:55.100]  intentionally not hit by an airplane and so on on all these issues there's a lot
[02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:59.540]  of evidence for us to stand with right huge amount of evidence and to go back
[02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:04.620]  to something you said before the break these the reason people think oh these
[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:09.460]  are crazy questions is because they can condition to the media that never asks
[02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:13.580]  these questions should be asking the questions I mean what we're talking
[02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:18.740]  about here is what CNN and Fox and NBC ABC CBS should be doing all the time
[02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:23.580]  yeah they should be saying how did the kid get in the school okay which we want
[02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:27.060]  to know we don't want just some little brush off here I mean you have a fairly
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:32.380]  heavy door there did you what kind of glass was there did he talk over video
[02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:36.400]  they have a video system he's not supposed to get in unless he identifies
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:41.820]  himself he's wearing all these weapons and so forth somebody let him in let's
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:46.380]  dig into this let's not stop let's be relentless until we get the answers all
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:50.140]  right let's dig into this the way the media used to dig into Nixon during
[02:56:50.140 --> 02:56:54.940]  Nixon administration Washington Post you bet absolutely you see so now people say
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:57:00.020]  well the people that ask these kinds of questions are crazy because people are
[02:57:00.020 --> 02:57:03.980]  hypnotized into believing everything the police says is true oh I know that's the
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:08.120]  danger that's the danger of where we are is that you're considered crazy if you

[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:19.060]  has become a joke in this nation because the people working for CNN for example
[02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:25.860]  refuse to ask real questions I heard a press conference three minutes outside
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:31.340]  chief of police at Sandy Hook and the reporters started asking questions about
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:36.300]  the guns what was the gun found in the trunk again was it the bushmaster was
[02:57:36.300 --> 02:57:42.300]  it the thing was that and was it two handguns that he had and so forth and
[02:57:42.300 --> 02:57:48.980]  the police chief danced around that the reporters were starting to zero in and
[02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:52.700]  on the fact that there were contradictory stories and then they all
[02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:57.420]  backed away like it was a time for a picnic let's go to a picnic whatever the
[02:57:57.420 --> 02:58:03.460]  chief says okay forget about it there was nothing left it was all a travesty

[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:43.380]  all right anyway I had a conversation with Richard Max on a Richard Mack on
[03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:48.580]  another program here and it was a good conversation and people are always
[03:00:48.580 --> 03:00:52.220]  wondering you know we got all this talk radio we got all you know all the news
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:55.700]  and it just keeps getting hash and rehash there's got to be some solutions
[03:00:55.700 --> 03:01:00.980]  well he talked about a solution a solution that everybody can do I don't
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:05.260]  just mean going around buying guns like that has been going on I mean what
[03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:09.580]  people need to do is they need to contact their sheriff and say hey look
[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:14.000]  we're gonna put something together this is going to be made public how do you
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.360]  stand on a Second Amendment are you going to keep these people from you know
[03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:21.340]  are you gonna protect our rights we elected you for this it's gonna be made
[03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:25.480]  public let them know it's gonna be made public I mean I've fortunately I've got
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:30.100]  the use of the radio station here but others have like yourself have the
[03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:35.420]  opportunity to put it out on on their web page you know there's a site well
[03:01:35.420 --> 03:01:38.860]  that's good to hold them accountable right now see where they stand absolutely
[03:01:38.860 --> 03:01:42.580]  because these are elected officials yes and if they don't if people don't like
[03:01:42.580 --> 03:01:46.780]  what they're hearing they're out of there so but in my conversation for
[03:01:46.780 --> 03:01:52.020]  instance here in Millard County Utah the sheriff made the cost of the comment
[03:01:52.020 --> 03:01:56.400]  that he wasn't a constitutional sheriff I want clarification but he was not a
[03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:02.880]  constitutional sheriff yeah what does that mean exactly are you not willing to
[03:02:02.880 --> 03:02:07.220]  uphold a Second Amendment or any of the Constitution I want clarification I know
[03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:10.680]  there's sheriff's out there calling themselves constitutional sheriff's
[03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:15.540]  they're involved in and they're in keeping their else I we want to know you
[03:02:15.540 --> 03:02:20.320]  know all right and that's gonna make it public yeah well well said Greg a good
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:23.260]  luck to you out there in Utah great great suggestion let's do that let's do
[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:26.980]  that all across the nation call your local sheriff find out where they stand
[03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:31.600]  on the Constitution if they're not constitutional sheriff's then they then
[03:02:31.600 --> 03:02:34.660]  they're in violation of their own oaths of office they should be kicked out
[03:02:34.660 --> 03:02:38.100]  immediately but let's let's take some more calls I want to get John's comment
[03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:42.040]  on this as well William in Connecticut William thank you for holding in and
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:46.700]  welcome to the show thank you very much well there's a lot of information that
[03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:53.620]  is not made public and that lead us to speculate in foreign theories I'm calling
[03:02:53.620 --> 03:03:02.340]  because I have information that I believe is legit Adam Lancer he told his
[03:03:02.340 --> 03:03:08.820]  mom that if he she put him in a special school his he was going to kill her in
[03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:15.140]  her sleep and he did he there's also suppose there's supposed to be a video
[03:03:15.140 --> 03:03:21.180]  about Adam Lancer going to the high school first but because he saw a
[03:03:21.180 --> 03:03:26.980]  patrol car outside he moved into the little school to the other school so I
[03:03:26.980 --> 03:03:30.580]  don't know why they are not saying that
[03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:38.620]  well wasn't John go ahead that said that Lancer had threatened his mother or he
[03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:42.500]  was very angry at her because she was going to have him institutionalized and
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:49.700]  that was at one point given as a motive for the killing but then later on
[03:03:49.700 --> 03:03:54.500]  questions were raised whether or not that actually ever happened that turned
[03:03:54.500 --> 03:04:00.260]  out to be as I recall somebody's opinion rather than a direct observation of what
[03:04:00.260 --> 03:04:05.220]  the mother was threatening to do and Adams reaction to that so all right good
[03:04:05.220 --> 03:04:08.300]  I don't know about that good good call though thank you call let's go to one

[03:04:41.540 --> 03:04:47.780]  it's not the best by Alex okay it is an article January 21st 2013 and
