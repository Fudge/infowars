[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:12.000 --> 00:37.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:37.000 --> 00:46.000]  Insane, a new poll out upon infowars.com. One in ten Americans wants war with Russia over down to airliner.
[00:46.000 --> 00:51.000]  They must think it'll be like Iraq or some other country that doesn't have any high-tech weapons.
[00:51.000 --> 01:01.000]  Islamic State, ISIS, now calls itself IS the last few weeks, now got a hold of a large-scale cash of U.S. heavy arms,
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.000]  like large artillery so they can shell and bomb and destroy major cities.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  But don't worry, your baby's diaper will be checked when you're flying, but ISIS will be armed by the globalist.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  Also, the MH-17 cover-up. Paul Watson did an in-depth interview with Michael Savage yesterday.
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  That interview is up on infowars.com, very informative.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  Guilt by insinuation, how America propaganda works, I want to get into that.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.000]  I wouldn't call it American propaganda, though. I'd call it globalist propaganda.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  The same propaganda the globalist used to capture this country.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  And some good news. You know, I was harping on this a few weeks ago when Obama was in Austin, Texas.
[01:45.000 --> 01:56.000]  The city refuses to pay for Obama visit. It would cost the town in Washington State $35,000.
[01:56.000 --> 02:04.000]  And they said, listen, let him do it. We're going bankrupt. He's up in the borders.
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.000]  The cities are collapsing. Hey, why didn't he go to Detroit and have them pay hundreds of thousands a day,
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  like it was in Austin, millions of dollars total with all his visits combined.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  But that's not even the true cost. The true cost is shutting down large parts of cities for hours.
[02:23.000 --> 02:27.000]  Instead of flying around in a helicopter, it's just disgusting.
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.000]  And it's not like he's meeting with a Russian president or the British prime minister or something at some state dinner.
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  So it's for pomp and circumstance or it's a national convention.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  No, it's just a grand entry everywhere he goes.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  They're saying 100,000 per day in Austin was way more than that.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  So that's some of the news up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  Continuing, we're going to get into the situation day 16 of the bombardment of Gaza.
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  So upwards of 600 Palestinians dead, more than 40 Israelis dead. And it goes on to report that Lufthansa, Delta,
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  U.S. Airways extend flight bans to Israel.
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  Jihadi cleric calls for Muslim fighters to join fight in Gaza.
[03:18.000 --> 03:26.000]  No, don't expect that they're being funded by the globalists to attack to attack other other areas like Iraq and not Israel.
[03:26.000 --> 03:32.000]  IDF troops told to prepare for next stage of op.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  So that's some of the news that's coming up on that front up on drugs report dot com.
[03:37.000 --> 03:46.000]  There's the headline magazine, Putin is Russia's bare chested Reagan.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Meanwhile, Michael Moore says on CNN, your racist if you own a gun, your racist white person doesn't like black people.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  That's a talking point. He owns nine homes.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  One of them worth more than $15 million has six bodyguards full time.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  I've seen them armed. They've been arrested armed in illegal areas.
[04:04.000 --> 04:11.000]  And he himself owns arsenals of weapons and owns defense contractor stocks.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  And again, nothing wrong with owning nine homes, except you say it's wrong for anybody else to.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  The truth is, again, they're more billionaire liberals than there are billionaire conservatives.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  Most of them got their money off government contracts and insider deals.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  They want to pull the ladder up like they've gotten the hot air balloon.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  They've got the wealth they want to pull the ladder up so nobody else can scurry up it.
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.000]  That's why they work overtime to destroy the middle class because any economist will tell you you get rid of the middle class.
[04:40.000 --> 04:48.000]  You have a permanent giant underclass, a tiny elite, and then the people never recover, never recover.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  I'll say that again. Never recover except at the end of the dark ages.
[04:52.000 --> 04:56.000]  The plague knocked out about 40% of the population, including the elite.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  So we did see a renaissance out of that.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  In the near future.
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  When you realize how fake it all is, the football, the basketball.
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  Security, alert. This is Homeland Security.
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  Analysis, info wars, building independent media operations.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  Prime directed discredit Alex Jones.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars.
[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail.
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[05:30.000 --> 05:32.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  They are never going to stop. They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.
[05:38.000 --> 05:48.000]  Block free iphone at infowars.com. Block free podcast and video feed. Imperatives destroy the planet TV.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  You got to set your eye on the enemy.
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  Not worry about what propaganda they put out.
[05:53.000 --> 06:09.000]  Get electrolytes for God you can fail it.
[06:24.000 --> 06:33.000]  The info wars life silver bullet silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce bottle and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  This is not a low grade formula.
[06:35.000 --> 06:42.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.
[06:42.000 --> 06:58.000]  Using electrical processes within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage or your home kitchen purchase your bottle of info wars life dot com silver bullet colloidal silver today and find other amazing supplements at info wars life dot com.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  Alex Jones here for info wars dot com.
[07:01.000 --> 07:13.000]  In the month of July we have got giant specials on everything at maiden1776.com. You already discounted made in 1776 t-shirts are only 1776.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  There's only 500 of each.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  We're talking about made in America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  This is more than a summer blowout special.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  This is a new declaration of independence but to expand the info war.
[07:31.000 --> 07:41.000]  We're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now when you get a membership at prisonplanet.tv for a limited time only $39.95 a year.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  Not just this July 4 weekend but the entire month of July at maiden1776.com.
[07:51.000 --> 07:57.000]  Molan Lombay you can take my gun from my cold dead aunt.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[08:52.000 --> 09:08.000]  It is the 23rd day of July already seven plus months into 2014. Hard to believe.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  And we're live on this Wednesday edition.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  We have the head of global research joining us for 30 minutes.
[09:22.000 --> 09:32.000]  Professor Michael Chassadosky to break down the geopolitical ramifications of what's happening in Ukraine but also Gaza.
[09:32.000 --> 09:42.000]  We're going to be again taking calls in the first hour in the first part of the second hour and the third hour today on the entire waterfront.
[09:42.000 --> 09:51.000]  Gun buyers scooping up AK-47 rifles after new sanctions ban their importation.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  ISIS tell shopkeepers mannequins must wear veils.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  Chinese city sealed off after bubonic plague death.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  We've got a whole bunch of bubonic plague cases in the United States and it barely even makes the news.
[10:06.000 --> 10:11.000]  Because that's politically incorrect to talk about what's coming over the border.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  Got a love of the White House has a big giant fence up around it.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  Got a love how, got to show your ID to buy a six pack of beer but not to vote in this country.
[10:24.000 --> 10:34.000]  Got a love how the TSA wants to grop your wife's breast and genitals and grab your rear end and inspect your baby's diaper.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  But the border is wide open.
[10:37.000 --> 10:51.000]  Got a big scandal up on the Washington, Canada border yesterday when a border agent of some type of the news reported put a gun to some Boy Scouts heads for taking photos.
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  Like the Border Patrol runs under orders when they're shot at by Mexican military and others.
[10:58.000 --> 11:09.000]  So we have a government that goes around picking on the little guys and people that they know aren't criminals because it's not scary to pull over a housewife and write her a half dozen tickets.
[11:09.000 --> 11:22.000]  Or an asset, forfeiture, seizure, some insurance agent's car because they had $3,000 in their purse and while you took the money and had it tested and found drugs on one of the bills,
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  they're going full well that out of 10 or 15 bills, most of them will have drugs on them.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  This is the supposed land of the free home of the brave.
[11:34.000 --> 11:45.000]  Meanwhile, we do have the former head of the Border Patrol Union, the deputy current head of the Border Patrol Union, the former deputy head of the Border Patrol itself,
[11:45.000 --> 12:05.000]  and countless other senior agents who follow a constitutional duty in the last six, seven years they've been directed to run checkpoints deep inside the United States that are unconstitutional and got a lot of heat for it, including from this talk show host.
[12:05.000 --> 12:16.000]  They are under attack being ordered to stand down the last four months on record to permanently break the border and the national sovereignty of this country.
[12:16.000 --> 12:33.000]  And over 100 million green cards are in the new Senate bill that their bipartisan system is trying to pass that would bring in the populations of three major Latin American countries, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  It's an epic level, globalist plan to crush the United States.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  How could the United States fall?
[12:39.000 --> 12:55.000]  Bring in 100 million, not 30 million, but 100 million in the next four or five years, 30 million a year, ladies and gentlemen, or more, 25 to 40 million depending on how you look at the numbers, pouring in, fully collapsing everything,
[12:55.000 --> 13:06.000]  and the controlled media will say no one knew how it happened, even if Obama gets in trouble. He'll just give himself a pardon in two years.
[13:06.000 --> 13:24.000]  And the Republican leadership is still playing dumb other than Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Ron Paul, Louis Gohmert, Walter Jones, there's a few others.
[13:24.000 --> 13:35.000]  Sarah Palander, a credit, says this is deliberate. And none of these people are perfect. I'm not perfect, but this is make it or break it time.
[13:35.000 --> 13:43.000]  Gaza, Israel goes in there every two years. It's a tragedy. It's tribal warfare. Take a side at your peril.
[13:43.000 --> 13:58.000]  The Russia situation is a super aggressive Western move that he stabilized the entire region. And I would be for it if it was the Soviet Union we were fighting, bringing freedom to Ukraine and other areas,
[13:58.000 --> 14:03.000]  liberating Eastern Germany, liberating Poland. That is not what's happening.
[14:03.000 --> 14:13.000]  George Soros admits he's behind it with the State Department. Just type in George Soros says he's behind Ukraine. He told the New York Times that. He bragged last month.
[14:13.000 --> 14:33.000]  And they're trying to bring Heather has two mommies, daddy's boyfriend, turn in your guns, men are bad, socialism is good, forced inoculation is good, be looted by the IMF and World Bank and be debt slaves.
[14:33.000 --> 14:44.000]  It's the globalist that are the big infection. They are what is racing through the body politic. And Ukraine is the big enchilada.
[14:44.000 --> 14:59.000]  But the next shoe to drop is the Pacific pivot, the Asian pivot with China saying they may invade and take islands, not just of Japan that are disputed off the coast of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[14:59.000 --> 15:12.000]  There's a whole bunch of them that they're disputing, but major islands that the Japanese took from them during World War II or the lead up to World War II that are now part of the Philippines.
[15:12.000 --> 15:26.000]  And they've said a few months ago they will nuke anyone that gets in the way of when they decide to take those islands. And folks, China has already been taking land from Vietnam and has already had military skirmishes with them.
[15:26.000 --> 15:44.000]  So you need to understand, this is serious. And our politicians are busy trying to militarize every law enforcement agency out there into paramilitaries to take on, in order of importance to them,
[15:44.000 --> 16:00.000]  returning veterans, veterans, gun owners, libertarians, constitutionalist, conservatives, land rights activists.
[16:00.000 --> 16:18.000]  And then they have a token go after the left, traditional leftist system is to go after GMO and things, which I actually agree with. I don't agree with burning down their facilities, I agree with burning down their lies in the Info War and exposing that I'd be all for GMO if they knew what they were doing
[16:18.000 --> 16:28.000]  or if they weren't engaged in piggybacking or Trojan horsing traits into the food that reduce fertility and increase cancer on record.
[16:28.000 --> 16:40.000]  By the way, they still have mainstream news articles the last few weeks saying Alex Jones is nuts, tinfoil hat, he believes the NSA is spying on everything.
[16:40.000 --> 17:06.000]  It gets on record that everything is scooped up illegally and dumped into giant vats. Major corporations get it and share it, the governments get it and share it, and it makes our country unsafe, not safe, and gives strategic elites access to the data that everyone else doesn't get.
[17:06.000 --> 17:28.000]  So it allows them to corner markets, consolidate markets, knock out their competition, destroying diversity of the marketplace, stagnating society. Do I need to go on here about what we're dealing with? Do I?
[17:28.000 --> 17:41.000]  So we'll open the phones up for this question. What do you think the most important issue is? The monetary crisis that has been designed to implode world currencies and bring in world government?
[17:41.000 --> 17:58.000]  Is the collapse itself the big story or how they engineered it? Or do those just go together? Is it the buildup by Western governments for nuclear war and preparations for it and news articles saying nuclear war is survivable and selling it like it might be the new fun adventure park to visit?
[17:58.000 --> 18:14.000]  Is it nuclear war? Is it the Crimea? Is it Israel? Is it ISIS being turned loose and IS as they call themselves? From Africa to Central Asia, did he stabilize the world? Is it the wide open border and the collapse of the United States?
[18:14.000 --> 18:28.000]  Currently, in our face, the shoe that's dropped, the balloon that's gone up, the train that left the station, I would say is the open border because this has now been triggered. It's not hundreds of thousands a month, folks.
[18:28.000 --> 18:44.000]  It's 300, 400,000 a month is my estimates and my border patrol estimates and my ICE estimates. It's around 100,000 kids a month. We're talking another 100, 200,000 adults at one border patrol station four months ago before they were ordered to stand down in Texas.
[18:44.000 --> 18:57.000]  They were grabbing upwards of 50,000 a month. That was in the news. 300,000 something thousand in the year before. Do you understand that? Do you understand that?
[18:57.000 --> 19:07.000]  And there's at least 100,000 illegal immigrant gang members now in the state of Texas alone, according to the DPS intelligence, which I concur with those numbers.
[19:07.000 --> 19:19.000]  So listen, all I know is some cop pulls me over, runs my license and wants to search my vehicle. I'm going to get them addressing down. I'm going to say, listen, I know you've been told to do this, but you need to be out there worried about our collapsing border.
[19:19.000 --> 19:25.000]  You know I don't have any record. And do I look like I'm on drugs? Leave me alone and stop trying to violate my fourth amendment.
[19:25.000 --> 19:37.000]  What's your problem, buddy? My problem is our country's burning down and the TSA is checking people's diapers. I don't care if it's an 80-year-old man with a colostomy bag who's having colon surgery.
[19:37.000 --> 19:49.000]  I don't care if it's a one-year-old baby. I'm fed up and I'm done. This is the end of the country. That brought it into perspective. I was thinking, what is the big crisis? It's the border.
[19:49.000 --> 19:57.000]  It's the front and center border. It's the front and center issue. We're going to open the phones up to see what you think coming up.
[20:20.000 --> 20:25.000]  That's 70% less than our competitors. You could buy three survival seed vaults for less than one of theirs.
[20:25.000 --> 20:32.000]  The survival seed vault from mypatriotsupply.com includes detailed planting and seed-saving instructions and ships same day.

[23:26.000 --> 23:32.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[23:32.000 --> 23:38.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[23:56.000 --> 24:19.000]  All the humiliation! Secretary of State John Kerry had to go through a metal detector screening before meeting with Egyptian President.
[24:19.000 --> 24:27.000]  They didn't trust him. Well, I know why the Egyptian President didn't trust him, who's backed by the military junta.
[24:27.000 --> 24:38.000]  It's because Kerry double-crossed them four years ago and basically had the 31-year U.S. ally and stabilizer in the region,
[24:38.000 --> 24:53.000]  Hosni Mubarak overthrown. They put the Muslim Brotherhood in, who then brought al-Qaeda in, and they began blowing up military bases and shooting down helicopters and crucifying Christians at the presidential mansion.
[24:53.000 --> 25:06.000]  This was on the foreign news. Christians upside down burning. 100-plus churches blown up in one day until 20 million Christians and Muslims hit the streets,
[25:06.000 --> 25:18.000]  many times bigger than the Muslim Brotherhood had done a year before, and they overthrew the Islamic State government and put the military in.
[25:18.000 --> 25:28.000]  And so now they won't be in a room with Kerry, and I understand why. Just like they overthrew Libya and put al-Qaeda in.
[25:28.000 --> 25:36.000]  Just like they're trying to overthrow Syria to put al-Qaeda in. Just like they tried to overthrow Iraq to put al-Qaeda in.
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.000]  And they've now basically done it within the new Islamic State area that we predicted would be part of Syria, part of Iraq.
[25:42.000 --> 25:53.000]  That was always the plan to break the country up. And again, I bring that up because our government won't bomb ISIS when they're on big convoys.
[25:53.000 --> 26:04.000]  Of course, they would never bomb them and said, well, it's Maliki's fault as Prime Minister. He hasn't been nice enough to the jihadis.
[26:04.000 --> 26:11.000]  And then some of the neocons go, well, we're just having all the Arabs kill each other. Like that's some type of moral policy.
[26:11.000 --> 26:18.000]  Yeah, even if you wanted the Arabs all kill themselves, neocons and neolibs, we know what it's really about.
[26:18.000 --> 26:27.000]  It's about creating a new super Islamic threat that can menace the West to keep the defense contractors in high cotton while we go bankrupt.
[26:27.000 --> 26:36.000]  But more importantly, menace the United States so that we can have our liberties taken in the name of being safe.
[26:36.000 --> 26:48.000]  We're being held hostage. The globalists are holding the gun and the gun is ISIS, IS, al-Qaeda, Wahhabi, Saudi Arabian scum.
[26:48.000 --> 26:59.000]  I'm not saying Saudi Arabians are scum. I'm saying ISIS, al-Qaeda are scum. And you've seen their activities. You've seen their behavior.
[26:59.000 --> 27:09.000]  If that's not scum, I don't know what is. Remember how Secretary of Defense Panetta and others, even in briefings with officers,
[27:09.000 --> 27:19.000]  make them remove their sidearms and have security thrown out of the room and won't give speeches to even uncommissioned officers in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[27:19.000 --> 27:28.000]  because they're scared of them, because they know that the military by and large knows who the enemy is.
[27:28.000 --> 27:35.000]  And I think it's actually legitimate that the political elite will not get around our soldier's arm now.
[27:35.000 --> 27:42.000]  You know, Saddam Hussein would walk around with 10,000 troops surrounding and the general public with AK-47s in the air.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  Not saying he's a good guy, just pointing out that Iraqis had more of a second amendment than we do under Saddam Hussein,
[27:48.000 --> 27:56.000]  an older CIA asset who was then flushed down the toilet after being set up just to serve by nose.
[27:56.000 --> 28:07.000]  We then see the new system coming into view where the only people that are allowed to be armed is al-Qaeda with heat-seeking missiles and artillery,
[28:07.000 --> 28:14.000]  which they now got from U.S. military bases and weapons caches that were just left there and that they were allowed to capture.
[28:14.000 --> 28:22.000]  ISIS was allowed to overrun Iraqi military bases built and maintained by the U.S. and contractors.
[28:22.000 --> 28:28.000]  They were ordered to stand down and give them the weapons, and the story is up on infowars.com.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  I want to go to break and come back in the next segment and get your take on all this.
[28:32.000 --> 28:39.000]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231, and you hear how good the callers are when I say first-time caller.
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  We're doing first-time callers in this hour, free-for-all in the next hour.
[28:44.000 --> 28:52.000]  To quote Ted Nugent, it's a free-for-all, 800-259-9231.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  I got me a rock and roll band, it's a free-for-all.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  I got me a radio network, it's a free-for-all.
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  Promoting freedom, unapologetically, thumbing our face in the tyrant's face, thumbing our nose right there,
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  letting them know we're aware of their scam, calling the fraud, blowing the whole fake paradigm to hell.
[29:10.000 --> 29:18.000]  To toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[29:18.000 --> 29:21.000]  And when you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  Turkish Prime Minister says he and Obama no longer talk.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  Price of beef and bacon reach all-time high.
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.000]  Former deputy head of the border patrol goes public.
[29:32.000 --> 29:35.000]  It's on infowars.com, drudgerport.com, link to it.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  It's in the immigration section on the site.
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  It's scrolled off last night, I want it reposted to the front page.
[29:40.000 --> 29:44.000]  He says government using immigrant children for asymmetrical warfare.
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  The truth, stay with us.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.000]  I didn't, I taste dirt in it.
[30:04.000 --> 30:05.000]  God knows what's in this.
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[30:09.000 --> 30:15.000]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with the Cropure G2.0 filtration system.
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  Now one is better.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  Tastes like nothing.
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  Yep, I know what good water tastes like, it's good water.
[30:19.000 --> 30:25.000]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues,
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  including tooth decay, lower in IQ, and even cancer.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[30:35.000 --> 30:40.000]  The Cropure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances,
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.000]  leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  This is very tasty.
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  It's good water.
[30:45.000 --> 30:46.000]  Refreshing.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  It's good.
[30:47.000 --> 30:49.000]  Go to infowarsstore.com today.

[30:58.000 --> 31:03.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  get healthy and detoxify.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[31:09.000 --> 31:14.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[31:17.000 --> 31:23.000]  You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[31:23.000 --> 31:26.000]  Then about a year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful,
[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[31:34.000 --> 31:39.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:39.000 --> 31:43.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation,
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  promoting true libertarian ideas.
[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.000]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off.
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  Super Detox Special at infowarslife.com.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[32:00.000 --> 32:06.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.000]  harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago, and I must say that was good stuff.
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others,
[32:24.000 --> 32:31.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[32:31.000 --> 32:38.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.000]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[32:44.000 --> 32:46.000]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  All the products in infowarslife.com are simply amazing.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality
[32:55.000 --> 33:21.000]  and other powerful products from infowarslife.
[33:25.000 --> 33:46.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, with Depeche Mode bringing us in.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.000]  We're going to your phone calls here in just a few minutes after I play some of these clips
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  where Nancy Pelosi, if you know what you're listening to,
[33:55.000 --> 34:02.000]  promotes Ford Foundation Liberation Theology calling the illegals pouring across little baby Jesus.
[34:02.000 --> 34:07.000]  I thought she was Ricky Bobby for a minute from Teledyga Nights
[34:07.000 --> 34:12.000]  and then continuing from Adon Salazar's article,
[34:12.000 --> 34:18.000]  former border agent government using immigrant children for asymmetrical warfare.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  That's what this is. We're going to play part of that interview that's up on infowars.com
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  and prisonplot.com here in a moment.
[34:25.000 --> 34:31.000]  First off, you've heard the rave reviews from listeners about the different products.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  We've only got five of them out in the last year plus because we take our time rolling these out.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  Two new products come out next week and the week after.
[34:40.000 --> 34:47.000]  But Survival Shield X2 is a quantum leap from the quantum leap in iodine supplements
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  that the first Survival Shield that's weaker and is seaweed based.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  It's a quantum leap from that. It's still excellent.
[34:57.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's great for kids because it's not as strong, very palatable in an organic palm oil base.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.000]  All the others.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  And we've had major companies try to call up household names and try to buy us out of this
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  because the contracts we have, it's happened three times now
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  because they've tested it. They've gotten it. They've seen it.
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  And we've got contracts. It's patented.
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  With the company we use, it's ours.
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  Look, I just dripped some on this video list page I've got here.
[35:27.000 --> 35:30.000]  And it just turned electric purple.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  We can document cam that for the TV viewers.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  So I was about to put some in water and drink it.
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  Electric purple. All other iodine turns red or black.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  And this is red color.
[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  But look up pure iodine. It's purple, folks.
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  The purest iodine there is. X2.
[35:46.000 --> 35:49.000]  Purest 99.999, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  Survival shield X2.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  And again, I took the original nascent iodine and had a detoxing effect in a month.
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  So consult with your physician before you take any of this.
[36:00.000 --> 36:04.000]  And I would start with the original survival shield that's been out about a year.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  I would start with that first.
[36:08.000 --> 36:13.000]  7 to 12,000 feet, tens of millions of years old, totally pure.
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  I would personally start, check with your physician, with the regular survival shield first.
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  And every person's different and then move on to the survival shield X2.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  I already took some this morning.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  I'm taking my second dose now.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  See, it's red.
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.000]  Turns yellow in the water, turns purple on paper.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Electric purple.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  Take my super male vitality.
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  And then put in the secret sauce that isn't out yet.
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.000]  Everybody's wondering about what it is. It may be months till this is out.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.000]  Look at that right there.
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  Ah, no food coloring in that, ladies and gentlemen.
[36:55.000 --> 36:59.000]  That is natural. We'll tell you what that is coming up.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  What the secret sauce is. Can I have a napkin?
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  I'm spilling this all over me.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  Oh, that matters. I just put it in my hair.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  You also hair care product.
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  The point is, is this is also funding our operation.
[37:12.000 --> 37:21.000]  And you've heard the rave reviews out there from all of the listeners about what the super male,
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  the super female vitality has been doing, what the lung cleanse has been doing,
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  what the fluoride shield has been doing.
[37:27.000 --> 37:31.000]  We have fluoride shield, key later, that cuts out, not just fluoride, a bunch of other stuff.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  25% off right now when you get the original survival shield with it.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  They're both 25% off right now.

[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  Everyone will be able to continue to use the same username and passcode.
[38:10.000 --> 38:16.000]  It's just that we're not going to offer the 5.3 months free when you sign up for a year.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  You can sign up for a year and get over five months free off the regular price

[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  or by just spreading the word about the show.

[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  and let them know why you're visiting their carpet place or their tile place or their restaurant
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  or their car dealership or why you're visiting their hotel
[40:05.000 --> 40:10.000]  because they're sponsoring this show or the stations that carry this broadcast.
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.000]  That is so incredibly essential to step up now.
[40:14.000 --> 40:19.000]  That people have been doing it, that's why we're going from being weekend show to nighttime show
[40:19.000 --> 40:24.000]  to almost every station that carries us at all ends up carrying us prime time live
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  because they get ratings and they get money because you are taking action
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  so I want to salute all of you out there, keep it up and tell people every day how they can tune in.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  That is the most important thing you can do.
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  Word of mouth and word of mouth is not just spreading about this broadcast
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  but about the border patrol that's telling the truth
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  and about all the good people inside the government that are blowing the whistle.
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  You know, when the former head of the border patrol blew the whistle
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  and said they've ordered the borders totally open four months ago,
[40:55.000 --> 41:05.000]  no one covered it but drudzreport.com, infowars.com, breitbart.com and worldentdaily.com.
[41:05.000 --> 41:08.000]  Again, drudge links to us and carries our stories.
[41:08.000 --> 41:14.000]  Those other sites really don't but I don't care because it isn't about infowars.com.
[41:14.000 --> 41:20.000]  It's about surviving and hanging together or hanging separately as Benjamin Franklin said.
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  This is for real. They are going to vote to take the guns.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  They're training the paramilitary police for it.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  They are changing the culture of the tyranny.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  The globalists are moving on every front.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  Okay?
[41:35.000 --> 41:44.000]  So, we admit how much trouble we're in or we lose everything.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.000]  We admit how much trouble we're in and forget our little differences
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  and come together under basic sovereignty, basic private property,
[41:53.000 --> 41:58.000]  basic right to self-defense, basic state sovereignty, basic family sovereignty,
[41:58.000 --> 42:04.000]  basic church sovereignty, it's illegal to have the feds paying money to clergy response teams
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  and turning them into federal mouthpieces.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  It's going on everywhere.
[42:09.000 --> 42:15.000]  It's illegal to have the NSA spying on everybody without warrants but they're doing it.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  This is the collapse of checks and balances.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  So, I want to play a couple clips here.
[42:21.000 --> 42:27.000]  First is this amazing interview up on infowars.com.
[42:27.000 --> 42:32.000]  Former border agent, government using immigrant children for asymmetrical warfare.
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  In other words, the government is assisting in the downfall of America.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  Close quote.
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  By leaving strategic areas along the Southwest U.S. border protected and by using children as a face of the illegal immigrant surge,
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  it's not just kids, to elicit public sympathy,
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  the federal government is engaging in a sophisticated military tactic known as asymmetrical warfare against the American people.
[42:53.000 --> 42:57.000]  A former U.S. border patrol agent is warning.
[42:57.000 --> 43:02.000]  He's the former deputy head.
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.000]  That's right, he's the current head of the former border patrol agents union.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  Zach Taylor.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  And I want to get him on the show, by the way.
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  I want to get all those guys on.
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  So, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  And folks, this isn't rhetoric, okay?
[43:18.000 --> 43:21.000]  This is what's going on.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  It's asymmetrical warfare. I've studied propaganda.
[43:24.000 --> 43:28.000]  Do you understand that? And I use the truth because it's the ultimate weapon against it.
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.000]  But the only thing I disagree with what Zach Taylor said is, he's 95% there.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  It isn't a federal government.
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  There have been cases, you can look them up.
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  I saw a documentary about it years ago, I think it was History Channel.
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.000]  Everybody's heard about this, where in the old days in the 70s with all the hijackings that were real,
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  the hijackers would get into the captain's uniform.
[43:54.000 --> 44:01.000]  Because it was psychological, it projected authority.
[44:01.000 --> 44:06.000]  And the commander-in-chief has the helicopters and the White House and all of it.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  It's not the president, folks.
[44:08.000 --> 44:12.000]  And the people in government doing this are usurpers.
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  Just like collaborating French that work with the Nazis.
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.000]  It was French that ran the government, folks, for the Nazis.
[44:20.000 --> 44:25.000]  They weren't French anymore. They were collaborators.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  Those aren't words.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  That's not rhetoric. That's what it is.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  So when he says the federal governments engage in asymmetrical warfare,
[44:34.000 --> 44:39.000]  no, the criminal bureaucracy, the Ford Foundation,
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  that openly promotes open borders, globalism,
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.000]  all these generals promoting open borders, North American Union, they are the ones killing the country.
[44:47.000 --> 44:54.000]  They are not congressmen and senators and the president.
[44:54.000 --> 45:00.000]  If the president ordered us to stand down if the Russians launched nuclear weapons, would he be the president?
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  No, he'd be an enemy officer.
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  This isn't rhetoric, folks. This is what we have.
[45:06.000 --> 45:12.000]  The last domino to fall with the military and the police who get it because they're inside and see it happening
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  is that it's not the federal government.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  That's why last year I called for it, drudged, linked to it.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  A bunch of top law professors read it and agreed with me.
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  My new Declaration of Independence, which I'm going to rewrite soon
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  and call the Declaration of Emergency Survival.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  The Declaration of SOS.
[45:33.000 --> 45:38.000]  I said, we don't. The Declaration of Independence
[45:38.000 --> 45:46.000]  says that it's our right and our duty to reform or abolish a government that's destructive of our basic liberty and freedom.
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.000]  Go read the Declaration of Independence. I'm paraphrasing it.
[45:49.000 --> 45:52.000]  So I said, listen, let's admit it's an occupied government.
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.000]  Have the states pull out of it declaring an illegitimate.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  Those that signed basically loyalty oaths, follow Bill Wright's constitution
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  and make immediate changes to secure the borders, to secure the debt, to secure the sovereignty,
[46:05.000 --> 46:10.000]  to stabilize the nation instead of cruising it towards destruction, clowered and piven.
[46:10.000 --> 46:18.000]  Have emergency elections. Have the legislatures, again, reappoint, vote themselves for U.S. senators
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  so there's balancing the states and the feds and reconstitute the republic.
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  And libertarians and people and anarchic capitalists go, let's just get rid of it all.
[46:26.000 --> 46:30.000]  I guarantee you, they're set up for that. The globalists plan to collapse the country later
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  and bring in a North American union and do what I just said, but with their people.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  And totally take over. We need to bring the republic back
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  because I'm telling you, the collapse is going to be used to bring in the new old order.
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  I've studied what they do in other countries.
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.000]  So I'm trying to restore the republic, save America.
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.000]  I'm a restorationist, folks, not a revolutionary.
[46:52.000 --> 46:57.000]  I'm a revolutionary in media, a revolutionary in fighting tyrants that seize the government.
[46:57.000 --> 47:03.000]  But if you technically get down to it, and what did the weathermen call conservatives and libertarians?
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  It's come out in the federal court. They call us counter-revolutionaries.
[47:06.000 --> 47:11.000]  It's come out that the Justice Department and their little commie meetings where they endorse Mao and stuff
[47:11.000 --> 47:15.000]  call us the counter-revolution.
[47:15.000 --> 47:17.000]  You know why? Because we are, folks.
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  We're the Americans in a desperate bid to save the country.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  That's why we're listed as public enemy number one by these criminals.
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  And the public is so dumbed down that if they buy it, we lose everything.
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.000]  You're living in the beginning of a Red Dawn scenario.
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  Literally.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  What happens in Red Dawn? They collapse Latin America into the United States.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  What's in Rex 84?
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  They get blamed on Reagan. That was just brought up by the Pentagon when Reagan was in there.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  They sit in the game, people. This is it. This is the beginning of it.
[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  Let's go to the clip with the head of the Border Patrol of Retirees Union
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  and the former deputy head of the Border Patrol itself. Here it is.
[47:59.000 --> 48:07.000]  The whole idea of asymmetrical warfare is to defeat your enemy from within.
[48:07.000 --> 48:12.000]  It is not to attack him from without. Of course, the threat comes from without,
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.000]  but we have to be inside of the United States to affect a successful warfare strategy.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  If asymmetrical warfare is going to be successful,
[48:24.000 --> 48:33.000]  the first thing that has to be done is to compromise America's defenses against invasion.
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  Because they have to have their personnel inside the United States to affect the infrastructure.
[48:39.000 --> 48:46.000]  Our hospitals, our schools, our electric grid, our power supplies, our water supply.
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.000]  Basically what we call infrastructure. All of those things create our infrastructure.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  But they have to affect the degeneration from inside the United States.
[48:57.000 --> 49:03.000]  The markers that we're seeing that indicate this is asymmetrical warfare
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  is because the reaction that the United States is taking
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.000]  is they're taking the opportunity of inviting these illegal aliens to come here.
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  They're concentrating them in one place in the United States, the Rio Grande Valley,
[49:18.000 --> 49:24.000]  and they're drawing the resources that are protecting the rest of the United States border
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  to care for the illegal alien children, to help with the overflow of the miners,
[49:30.000 --> 49:37.000]  to transport, to take care of the needs of these people while they're in Homeland Security custody.
[49:37.000 --> 49:44.000]  All this takes the resources that are protecting America at the border off of the border.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  So now the borders are wide open.
[49:47.000 --> 49:52.000]  This gives the people that are trying to get their infrastructure, their personnel,
[49:52.000 --> 49:58.000]  their drugs, their dirty bombs, their biological weapons,
[49:58.000 --> 50:03.000]  their chemical weapons into the United States without being noticed
[50:03.000 --> 50:08.000]  because this part of the border is open. It is not being patrolled.
[50:08.000 --> 50:16.000]  It is a perfect military strategy. It doesn't raise any eyebrows because we're focused on the children.
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  But we need to focus on our children because this is asymmetrical warfare.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  Everything says it is.
[50:25.000 --> 50:32.000]  And the way the United States government is responding to it is concealing that fact from the American people.
[50:32.000 --> 50:33.000]  That's right.
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  In other words, they're assisting in the downfall of America.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  And you need to understand that.
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.000]  I think I'm going to play that each hour today.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  I think everybody should call their friends and family and tune in to hear this.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  And I want him on.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  Do you understand?
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.000]  I studied warfare, folks. This is asymmetrical warfare directed by the District of Columbia.

[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  It's a very simple asymmetrical warfare equation.
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.000]  Turn the guns in for the children. Have war with Russia for the children.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  Put al-Qaeda in charge for the children. Doesn't matter how crazy it is, it's for the children.
[55:05.000 --> 55:08.000]  We're going to go to your phone calls now right through into the next hour.
[55:08.000 --> 55:19.000]  The whole free number to join us, 800-259-9231. Fred, David, Tom, David, Michael, and others were going right to you.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  But first I wanted to play this clip. Nancy Pelosi yesterday said border children should be treated like refugee baby Jesus.
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  Here's the difference.
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.000]  Herod was ordering all the firstborn to be killed.
[55:30.000 --> 55:35.000]  A repeat of what had been done just nowadays. They just tell the mothers it's cool they go out and kill their kids.
[55:35.000 --> 55:39.000]  The firstborn with abortion. The more things change, the more they stay the same.
[55:39.000 --> 55:48.000]  So Christ had run back to their homeland and then run, I guess, out of there.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  Constantly people were running. You can go back to the time of Moses.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  Firstborn was ordered killed.
[55:54.000 --> 56:01.000]  This is liberation theology taught by the Ford Foundation where they teach that white people are the devil
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.000]  and that everyone else is Christ-like and that Jesus was a communist
[56:06.000 --> 56:14.000]  and that that's why we should have open borders and all be homeless because Christ was homeless and stuff like that.
[56:14.000 --> 56:18.000]  It's socialist communist religion. Let's go to that clip.
[56:18.000 --> 56:25.000]  I always reference the National Catholic Conference of Bishop's Statements in which they said
[56:25.000 --> 56:32.000]  David Jesus was a refugee from violence. Let us not turn away from these children and send them back into a burning building.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  That's the bishops.
[56:34.000 --> 56:40.000]  So we have to do this in a way that honors our values but also protects our border
[56:40.000 --> 56:46.000]  and does so in a way that the American people understand more clearly.
[56:46.000 --> 56:53.000]  And that's the enemy on MSNBC, White House, Globalist Command Base, media.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  And to be technical, they had fled to Egypt because Herod was going to kill all the firstborn.
[56:57.000 --> 57:02.000]  They were coming back to Israel and back to Bethlehem to register for the census.
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  So I guess that's the story. I'm going from memory.
[57:05.000 --> 57:11.000]  The point is that this is liberation theology to say that these little children are little baby Jesus,
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  15-year-old gangbangers and the rest of it.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  Can I send refugees to Guatemala? No, they throw them in the street.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  The point is they use our openness as a joke.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  Let's get to one call this hour. I've got everybody else in the next.
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.000]  Fred and Nevada, what do you think the most important big story is right now?
[57:29.000 --> 57:37.000]  I think the entire story is important and that the narrative to explain why they want to destabilize
[57:37.000 --> 57:42.000]  and collapse our country, the Globalist, in the way that you've explained it.
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  But if there was a way to make it understandable to everyone in a short narrative,
[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  because when I try to explain it, the logical, you know, most people they can't understand,
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  well, why would they do this? What would be their reason behind it?
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  They don't understand it. Even the gun argument.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  Well, the simplest argument is the strictest gun laws are in Mexico.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  But in Mexico, God forbid you have a spent bullet shell. You're never seen again.
[58:05.000 --> 58:10.000]  You go to jail forever. So obviously the gun laws don't seem to work too well in Mexico.
[58:10.000 --> 58:17.000]  But people need to understand what their intent is and what they're trying to do.
[58:17.000 --> 58:23.000]  Because it's so compartmentalized, it sounds crazy when you bring up one little area and another.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  They can't comprehend it.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.000]  But again, the Globalists are in central control, so they're able to destabilize things and get more power out of the collapse.
[58:31.000 --> 58:35.000]  I mean, it's actually simple though, but I understand what you're saying.
[58:35.000 --> 58:40.000]  We'll be right back with more calls. Stay with us from Michael, David, Tom, David and others.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  Your call is coming up back in 70 seconds.
[58:42.000 --> 58:49.000]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Groot.
[58:51.000 --> 58:59.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[58:59.000 --> 59:10.000]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[59:10.000 --> 59:20.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the earth.
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[59:24.000 --> 59:28.000]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  Experience the new formula.
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  Experience the ancient purity.
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  Shield your family.
[59:34.000 --> 59:39.000]  Survival Shield X2, available now at InfowarsLife.com.
[59:39.000 --> 59:46.000]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  We're taking your phone calls, toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  What do you think the biggest crisis is right now?
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  Every major crisis out there, the Russian situation, the ISIS situation, the border situation is being orchestrated by the globalists to control every western government.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  David and Indiana, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Alex, I think that the greatest problem we're facing right now, and I'm sure others would have varying opinions on this,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  but it's obviously the complete implosion of our border. It has to be.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  This is the most dangerous event in my lifetime, and I'm sure, possibly in yours, because of the 30 million or so that are already here that were here before this crisis ever got started.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  And now, with the influx that's at the border currently, and I actually called my senator the other day and whatever good that would do to tell him about this and to discuss this with him.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  Obviously, I got a computer-generated letter about it, but I really don't think that even the leaders that think they're doing good in some cases,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  with the exception of Rand Paul and others, I really don't think they understand the gravity of what we're dealing with here.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  This is a complete invasion of our society, and we love everybody. We're open with people, but the problem is they don't want to come to our nation through the legal processes.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And unfortunately, the Democratic Party, and I understand there's demons on both sides of this issue, but they are protecting these new voters.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  They are in support of killing our children in abortion in their death cult.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  I was about to say, they want to kill all the babies in abortion, and they want to dumb them down once they get them in school,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  but oh my goodness, they use our Christian values, oh, let unlimited groups in, and say it's about a political takeover and admit they're coming for our guns,
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  and they want to bankrupt the country under Cloward and Piven. This is asymmetrical warfare period, and I agree with you.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  It shows the total recklessness of the elite political class and the fact that they want to fully break the back of this country.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  I appreciate your call. We've got to do whatever we can to reverse this. Let's go to David in Washington, and we're taking first-time callers.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  What do you see as the biggest crisis? Go ahead.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Well, I kind of see everything as the crisis itself. It's like all the little foxes, they've sent out all the little foxes to destroy the whole vine,
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  instead of waiting for the one big event.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000]  That's right. Esau's fables, the little foxes, spoil the grapes.
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  I was going to hide that interesting take. I'm a mailman, and I've got nine kids.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  I don't have car payments, but when I look at people, their main concern is food prices, energy prices, and they don't have a job.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  My son is fully capable of working. A good kid. Everybody loves him.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  He's an older person. He does yard work. He cannot find a fast food job. It's weird.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  He's been putting in applications all the time.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  You've got to have a two-year college degree from Last Chance College over here, where we live, in order to even get into the door thing.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  Well, the answer for your son is just to go the entrepreneurial route, knock on doors, mow yards until he gets money to get a truck and a trailer,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  and then hire people under him. It's the only entrepreneurial system. The big corporations and the service market is meant to shut down.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  It's designed to make sure you don't get a job.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  That's the way it seems. And lastly, I did have some hope.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Not everybody can do what I've tried to train myself to do for the last five years. Everybody has to do what they can do to stop,
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  whether it's not shop at the big box stores.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Well, stay there. I'm going to come back, David, to your solutions.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Then Tom, then Alan, Chase, Chris, your calls are all coming up. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  I can taste dirt in it.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  God knows what's in there.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system.
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  That one is better.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000]  Tastes like nothing.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Yep. I know what good water tastes like. It's good water.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate, and many others.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues, including tooth decay, lower IQ, and even cancer.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances, leaving only fresh-tasting, deliciously clean water.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  It's good water.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000]  Refreshing.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  It's good.

[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  This is a new declaration of independence.

[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  The info wars life silver bullet silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a two ounce body and it's not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  This is not a low grade formula.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:42.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver.

[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  Brashings of the lives and disinformation, waging war.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  On corruption, I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  I believe in the American dream.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  I believe in freedom.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  I believe in the free market, but not if it's a game free market run by globalists that use socialism to buy us off and make us kept slaves.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  I do not like the current system and I've studied it and know that it's a fraud.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  We heard excerpts of an interview that we've had posted at the top of infowars.com with a story that's particularly powerful and needs to go viral.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  And that's what the former deputy head of the border patrol.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  He's now the head of the retired border patrol association and union.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  Former border agent government using immigrant children for asymmetrical warfare. In other words, the government is assisting in the downfall of America.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  Close quote.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  That's the top story on infowars.com. I want it red linked.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  It went out last night.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Drudge link to it.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Drudge report.com.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  That's great, but it needs to get more attention.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  I'm going to have it retweeted.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  Feds move to collapse America.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  Feds behind attack on America.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I want to tweet it out with that message right now.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  I want to warn the people because that's what this is.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  When Rick Perry says Obama's screwing up on the border or doesn't know what he's doing, that's bull.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  The current head of the border patrol, the deputy had the former had the former deputy had the head of the current union, the deputy had the current union, the retiring union had.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  All of them are telling you there's been a four month ordered stand down and they've been in Guatemala telling people to come across.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Now I opened the phones up earlier and I asked the question.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  What is the big story?
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  What is the big issue?
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Is it the West trying to overthrow Russia?
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  Is it the West putting Al Qaeda all over the Middle East and Africa and murdering Christians everywhere?
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Allowing up more churches today?
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  Raping, murdering, just unbelievable.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000]  Is it the border collapsed?
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]  Is it the dollar starting to go under?
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Is it the food prices exploding?
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Folks, the big story is it's all being orchestrated.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  In every case, George Soros brags his open border society is behind this with Obama.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  In every case he bags, he's behind the Ukraine situation.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  He's behind the move to use executive orders to ban the guns.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  He's involved in Obamacare.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  He's demonizing Soros and saying he runs it all.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  He's willing to brag and he's one of the head honchos.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  He's one of the grand poobos or quarterbacks that is in there and admitting as a mafia don of this globalist New World Order.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  That's what they are, organized crime, that they're doing it.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:33.000]  One of their senior captains in naval parlance, top generals or field marshals in ground war nomenclature,
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  is openly bragging and they're snickering.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  And he says it in Spanish, the clips up on infowars.com.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  Congressman Gutierrez to La Raza get amnesty to punish Americans against illegal immigration.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  This is dictatorship because if you can use democracy to bring in unlimited groups that are clients that will vote however you want
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  and you can ignore laws so they can do that, that is asymmetrical warfare.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  And then they go, come on, don't be racist, be for the children.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  And the children are just pawns in the game.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  And I feel for them.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  But it's a plan. I want to go to your calls. Tom, Alan, Chase, David, Chris, we're going to go to all of you.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Right now, let's go back to David.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  David called him and got caught off by the break.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  He said he's found a solution and he wants to comment on the overall system.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  Go ahead.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  Yeah, my solution just deals with my skill level and everybody needs to deal with the solution.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  I have a solution with their own skill set, but I deal in litigating and I learned I'm not a lawyer,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  but I did train legally on my own.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  My own home is going as a man.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  And, you know, I'm not selling anything, but I learned a lot from Richard Cornforth and several others.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Jurisdictionary, some people might be familiar with that.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  Oh, yeah, Jurisdictionary. I want to get the guy that heads Jurisdictionary on.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I've asked him over the years, he's fallen through the cracks.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  He's had a great radio show he does once a week.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  It's on here in Austin and I think he's out of Florida.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  His stuff is dead on. That's not patriot mythology.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  That's real stuff.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And again, how shocking to hear you say that as a man, you taught yourself something like my grandpa,
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  my dad's dad, do how to fix anything and people used to read books and be self-taught.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  I mean, how bizarre that you would learn how to be a pro se litigant to defend yourself and others.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  How evil. Go ahead.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  Yeah, well, I just briefly, since I deliver out of a truck and I don't have to do a lot of mental work for my job.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  I just downloaded on my iPod, shows like yours, webinars from Frederick Graves, Cornforth, other people.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  I download 18 hours a day for several years and then I did hands-on work and I've litigated against many a debt collector
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  and I got my bank over a barrel. They can't move. They're stuck.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  And I'm calling on all people who are real pro se litigants, not those that think they can go in there
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  and they just get their stuff dismissed in their job, but people that really know how to work the system
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  and they need to take what they've learned in their skill set and still go after your debt collectors
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  because there's come back, but we need to go after government workers who go outside the jurisdiction
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  of their government duties because I've found that you might have local police force
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  that's getting out of control, but you need to go after the keyless heel and that is their God, which is their wallet.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  So I don't care what the police chief says. You go after that police agent who knocked your wife down and slept around.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  Well, you just need to learn how to connect the dots.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  Because they don't have immunity when they're outside of their office
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  violating the code of their office and violating the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  And it needs to be done not just from a police. They're usually the main target because they're the face of all this, good and bad.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  The bureaucrats, the code enforcers, the city council people.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  I mean, the mayor of Austin needs to be hit with 50 lawsuits and a class action suit over the fluoride in the water
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  because it's not just fluoride that they've got a mandate for. Where they buy it from has hundreds of chemicals and other things in it.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  You demand a test. You get that test. Now you have them with all the other toxic waste that they make us pay to put in our water
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  that would have to be paid to be stored and we have them.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  I mean, there's so many fronts. People say, well, Alex, you need to sue them.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  Or people say, why are you being so mean? I'm not being mean.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  That guy flips off medical doctors that come in there to speak about Harvard studies on brain damage.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  And laughing well starts laughing and literally flips people off on the news.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  Because they know if their fluoride falls, it all falls. I appreciate your call.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Minnesota. Tom, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  Hi, Alex. I think the biggest problem is that the NSA holds blackmail power over the Supreme Court.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  They've been spying on the Supreme Court and Bill Binney said it. Ed Snowden said it as well.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  No, that's right. We have William Binney, number four at the NSA, who quit 10 years ago over it all saying, look,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  when he was there, there was blackmail going on and it's about total control and totalitarianism.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  Those are quotes. And that the spying is total. Total, total, total.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  Correct. And you mentioned parallel construction on your interview yesterday.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  If you don't know, some of our listeners don't know what that is. Look up Bill Still interviews Bill Binney on YouTube.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  And he'll explain what parallel construction is and how NSA has been using parallel construction for the past 15 years.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Go ahead, Colin.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  He'll explain. If you look up, if you don't know what parallel construction is, if you heard that term yesterday and you're not familiar,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  look it up on YouTube and Bill Binney will explain it. Look up Bill Still interviews Bill Binney.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  Well, what they started doing when I first talked to whistleblowers back in 96 years,
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  the NSA builds a whole separate Internet and hubs hooked into everything so that they are the Internet.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  And that's basically what they're doing. And that's the type of unconstitutional NSA searches that deny due process.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  It's a technique used by law enforcement to hide the fact that evidence in a criminal case originated with the NSA.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  That's what came out in Reuters last year that we've been telling people about for years, is where it's all being listened to.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  They just lie about it because it's illegal. Again, it's a giant criminal racketeering, organized crime,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  kingpin operation of government in a concerted effort to engage in a mass fraud, violating our rights with illegal spying,
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  but then also using the data to then put innocent people in prison, frame people, set people up, corner the market,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  and then they lie in a mass conspiracy in court to abscond the truth and conceal that in a mass act of organized crime perjury.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  Correct.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  Let's put it back up on screen again. I'm going to read the definition from the federal court of this parallel construction.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:37.000]  It's a technique used by law enforcement, you mean organized crime, to hide the fact that evidence in a criminal case originated with the NSA.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  In its simplest form, the NSA collects information showing Mr. Anderson committed a crime.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  This happens most commonly in drug cases. The conclusive information is passed to the Drug Enforcement Agency,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  who then walks, works backwards with the conclusion to create an independent legal body of evidence to use against Mr. Anderson.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  And that's a whitewash, folks. They use confidential informants to lie and say it. They frame people with it.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  They only go after drug cases that aren't part of the inside organization.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  And the average cop out there isn't involved in this. This is done centralized by the feds.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:19.000]  But now, through the threat fusion centers, this parallel construction is now creeping into every form of life.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Every form of daily life is very dangerous. Anything else?
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  Nope. God bless. Thanks for taking the call, Alex.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  Yeah, God bless you. Absolutely, folks. This is what they do.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  And then they'll hear you talking about all the guns you've got, even if they're legal.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  They don't want you to have those guns.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  They will do a fake 911 call to your house that doesn't even ring, but that creates a record, and then they will SWAT team your house.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  And again, it has nothing to do with security. We're seeing that with the border right now.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  It's a criminal takeover. We'll be right back.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  You deserve the best. Happiness is 5starsoap.com.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  How good is a Big Berkey water filter?

[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storeable foods from MyPatriot Supply.

[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  If I sound hysterical sometimes, it's because I've been naive. Things were worse than I thought.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  Fundamentally, I thought that the globalists were using sophisticated cultural manipulation on the Democrats predominantly and that they weren't criminal in their middle and lower ranks.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  But learning about Acron over the last six years and myself going out and dealing with grassroots Democrats, a lot of them actually know what's happening and get off on the power trip of being associated with a criminal takeover.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  And they really want to lock up libertarians and conservatives. They really want to make us their slaves.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  And they know they're not liberals. They know they're authoritarians like a moth to flame. They're attracted to the altar of evil and they worship that twisted power.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  And I think it's just basic nihilistic corruption because other cultures have done this as well, but people think cheating and stealing and lying and is cool.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  And they're converting the government agencies to people like this where it's come out in the news that the IRS has parties and celebrates up in Dallas at their IRS center in the news that they're persecuting libertarians and conservatives and Christians and have said they're going to intensify it.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  And MSNBC goes, of course we're shutting down the Tea Party and arresting people with tax exemption. We need to harass them more.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  These people are dangerous.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  I just believe in America more than this because I know Republicans are bad in many respects and blue bloods are and there's some racists in the Republican Party.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  But when you look at the Democrats, just the way they operate top down, they really are a criminal operation now.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  Through and through, through and through. Democrats that aren't are clearly criticizing Obama, shang or not part of it and have good voting records on guns, sovereignty, the family.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  They're more like old fashioned Democrats. By old fashioned, I mean like the 80s.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  But the Democratic Party today is so radical that they'll do anything. They might blow up New York City like Obama says he's worried about and make Obama a dictator.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  They could do anything at this point. Anything.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  I mean they publicly arm Al Qaeda publicly. I mean it's just, it's over the top. Chris in Nevada, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000]  Good morning, Alex from FEMA Zone 9 and the Empire of Lies.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  You bet, brother.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  You're speaking about a symmetrical this morning and I thought it's important to define the word.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  The word means without symmetry, form or order. Aborder chaos.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  In fact, chaos is the assembly of worshipers of Osiris.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  And when we hear crisis, it's the cry of ISIS in the global war.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  This is the silent weapons, quiet wars form of war, which is a constant full spectrum global battlefield.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  It's the soft type of war or bullying frogs type where everything is war in one form or another so that the masses don't notice that war is being perpetrated against them.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  The Grand Drago, George Soros, a.k.a. Georgie Schwartz, is one of the key operators of the Council of Twelve of the Global Elite who are behind this insidious global annihilation project.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  But thanks to you, Alex, and the rest of the host at the GCN Network, we've got the new world order on the line. Death to the new world order.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  Wow, you really have got your act together and I had seen what you just pointed out yourself.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  People asking James Bond movies based on a lot of real things that happened or similar things, at least the earlier Ian Fleming ones with Sean Connery.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  Why does Spectre openly wear the Spectre or Hydra ring on their finger?
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  Because it's important to throw it in your face. And how do they operate? Creating chaos, order out of chaos.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  What do they call the Al-Qaeda forces? ISIS. Crisis. And asymmetrical warfare. We are seeing them hit us with asymmetrical warfare.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  What's your background? You sound like you know what you're talking about.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  Well, I also am a needed learned man in the law like your first caller that responded about Dr. Frederick Graves at the jurisdiction area.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  He's one of the people I study with also.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  So are you a Mason?
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000]  No, never been affiliated with a Mason. My grandfather was 32nd degree, but that's the closest I ever got.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:41.000]  No, no, there's some good groups of Masons that are aware of all this. They're fighting it behind the scenes and they use terms like what you just said, learned, you know, student of the law and things.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  Very interesting. Call back again. We've got a special guest coming up. But what you just heard from that caller was Pirveritas. I'm Alex Jones. Stay with us.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:58.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:09.000]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep. I can take her on romantic dates. I get her flowers. You name it. She's just not the woman I married.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  Oh, Ralph, that's just awful.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxified.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:35.000]  Then about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals. And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen. This is innovating. And the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation, promoting true libertarian ideas.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2. Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:18.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:25.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:30.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:40.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA. The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:01.000]  Now available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3888-533-139.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:31.000]  For receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:44.000]  Monday through Friday we're here live. 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central Standard Time. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're back weeknights 7 o'clock Central with info wars nightly news.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  And we now conservatively reach 20 million people a week one way or another through our broadcast radio, TV, print media, infowars.com, prisonplata.com.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  And we're only one independent group promoting true libertarian pro-western ideas worldwide.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  Unfortunately, the ideas of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment are not being promoted by the West, but a neo colonialism with an attempt to establish neo feudalism and that's in the club of Rome's own words is being established to bring in neo feudalistic fascism in their own words.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  And daily, I read globalresearch.org. They also carry some of our work from Paul Joseph Watson and others. And the head of it is Michael Chasodowski.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  He's a award winning author, professor of economics at the University of Ottawa founder and director of the Center for Research on Globalization, Montreal, and editor of the global research CA website.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  He's the author of Globalization of Poverty and the New World Order 2003 and America's War on Terrorism 2005. His most recent book is entitled Towards World War III Scenario, the dangers of nuclear war.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  I want to talk about that with him. That was from 2011 predicting what we're now seeing. He is the contributor to the encyclopedia Britannica. His writings have been published in more than 20 languages, globalresearch.org.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  So Professor Chasodowski, good to have you back on. It's been a few years. A lot is happening. And I want to cover the waterfront and look at this MH17 as the Rosetta Stone to understand the policy of false flag or created crises that it's being used as war rhetoric to expand these proxy wars and to get your
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  breakdown on where you believe it's going next because reading your writings out of everybody out there, you have predicted with a lot of precision what's been unfolding with the proxy armies of ISIS and Al Qaeda, what's been unfolding in the proxy wars headed up by Soros and others.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  So thank you for joining us.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  Well, I'm delighted to be on the program, Alex. And thank you for the opportunity to discuss and debate these important issues.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  And what we have attempted to do is to address the facts of Malaysian Airlines crash. And I think, in that regard, we share, I mean, we share in a sense, a counter consensus that the facts have been manipulated, that the mainstream media is giving us a version which just doesn't stand up,
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  that the Obama administration is accusing Moscow without a shred of evidence. And now we have a lot more information. We have declarations from the Russian military.
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  We have also, we have talking points in US intelligence, we've satellite images and so on. And I think we have to establish what the facts are. And I'm going to go to, in fact, declarations which were made by Malaysian Airlines.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  I've been going back and forth to Malaysia for the last seven or eight years. I know people, I know the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister country, including the head of Malaysian Airlines.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:44.000]  But this is a statement that they made right at the outset. And they, they did, first of all, they did confirm that MH17, when they entered Ukraine airspace, they were immediately instructed to fly at a lower altitude.
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  The normal cruising speed is 35,000 feet. As we know, the legal, let's say the legal tip, the legal limit is 32. They were pushed down to 33.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  Then we also had information that this was provided by, by Russian sources, but, but they were also eyewitness reports to the fact that there were two, there was one Ukraine fighter plane, which was spotted very close to the aircraft.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  In fact, within a five kilometer distance, and one was suspect that this aircraft was in a sense escorting MH17 in a commercial aircraft corridor.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  I should mention that's very important is that the Ukraine fighter jet, SU-25 fighter equipped with the R-60 missiles was detected within five to 10 kilometers of the Malaysian aircraft, according to Russian sources, in a corridor which is reserved for commercial aircraft.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  So that in effect, we've got a lot of information to the fact that, that the flight was actually MH17, which normally cruises over the Sea of Azov, like many other flights in a southerly direction.
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  And all previous days, and that was revealed by, by other sources in all previous days, the flight path was over the Sea of Azov, very much removed from the war zone.
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  And on that particular day, July 17th, the flight path went directly over the war zone. That is something which is fairly well established.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  But we have other information regarding the deployment of book anti-aircraft missiles, ground air missiles in Ukraine by the Ukrainian armed forces.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  And the other side of the story is, well, the other side of the story is that Russia is not behind it. We can't make any, we cannot make any clear assessments without, you know, without an investigation.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  This was a criminal act, so there has to be a criminal investigation.
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  Sure, sure. And if folks just joined us, Professor Michelle Jostosky joined us, a geopolitical expert, especially on things happening in Europe and with Russia in the whole Caucasus, Crimea area.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  But expanding on this with you, I want to get your larger view on the geopolitical ramifications.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:54.000]  Clearly, we saw Kerry last year say, we have to strike Syria right now, or they could nuke us in an hour, just like Tony Blair saying, 40 minutes, we can be nuked by Saddam.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  It's total proof they launched the chemical attack. And then it came out, even with a UN and MIT, that it was the rebels and the Saudi Arabians.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  And it was infowars.com and globalresearch.ca that was leading the research on that. So when you have parties that have been caught doing this over and over again, you have Russia not standing to gain by shooting down a country that they're on good relations with and do heavy trade.
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  And when you have the plane being diverted, for whatever reason, through an area that no other aircraft were in, where the Ukrainians had been bombing people, then you have them saying only the Russian rebels had these anti-aircraft missiles.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  And there's AP photos and videos of the rebels with the missiles on the AP's website. It's not like this is Russian propaganda.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  I mean, look, look, I just go where the truth is. If Russia was behind this, I'd come out and say Russia's behind it. Looks like a mistake because they don't stand to gain from it.
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  But it leans towards as wicked as the West has gotten, and now the Russians releasing the radar tracking of these other aircraft, and NATO and the U.S. won't release theirs and won't release the satellites, and Ukrainians block the air traffic control tapes.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  I mean, we've got to think they might have blown it up themselves on purpose. I mean, they're that bad. I was thinking maybe they diverted it into there, hoping it would get shot down.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  And then it's a tragedy, but you've got to ask who sent it, Professor. And again, I'm not trying to be a cheerleader for Russia, but I'm sorry.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:30.000]  The truth and the evidence points towards the State Department lying about this.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  Well, I think your comments are right to head on because the comparison with Syria and the chemical weapons hoax hoax is now proven to be correct.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  Namely, that was the rebels that had the chemical weapons and Bashar al-Assad was blamed for having chemical weapons.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:43:04.000]  And that even led to UN intervention, which then subsequently led to the dismantling of those chemical weapons. Incidentally, the chemical weapons have been shipped to southern Italy, and then the hands of the Calabresa mafia.
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000]  That's something people don't know, and they're going to be sold in the secondary market.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  But to get back to the issue of blaming Russia, where, you know, it's not like simply blaming Mongolia or blaming, you know, blaming Bokina Faso.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  What they're doing is they're blaming a country which has vast military capabilities, nuclear weapons, very sophisticated intelligence apparatus, which sometimes people forget.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:50.000]  We're certainly not building an apology for the Russian Federation. What are concerned is to reveal the truth.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:44:00.000]  But I should mention that yesterday, President Vladimir Putin made a statement. It's a very balanced statement.
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  We're not building an apology for the Russian president. But what he said, he said, the West is building scenarios which could potentially, quote, destabilize the existing world order.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  And he's concerned because those scenarios threatens Russia's sovereignty.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  And he's also referring to the NATO buildup on the border, the so-called missile defense shield, which he says correctly isn't the defense of deployment.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  He's talking about the ABM system. We are at extremely dangerous crossroads in world history.
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  And we have to rein in the insanity, the sheer insanity of our politicians.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000]  And not only the United States, the Canadian prime minister is the same.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000]  And that also applies, let's say, it also applies to what's going on in Israel, where people are being killed.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  And it's not a question of saying who we are in favor or against. It's acknowledging the truth.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:19.000]  600 people are killed in Gaza. And now the Wall Street Journal says, well, it's all right to kill them because they're subhumans.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000]  And they control, you know, they control the support Hamas, which is a terrorist organization.
[01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:32.000]  But the problem is that the mainstream media at this stage has gone into overdrive.
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  It is no longer involved in so-called classical media lies. It is involved in odious statements which justify the killing of civilians.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000]  And that is true in Palestine. It's true in Syria. It's true in Ukraine.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  I have been analyzing the nature of the conflict in the Donbass region, which has haven't been reported.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:10.000]  The Ukraine Ministry of Internal Affairs, Homeland Security, so to speak, revealed data.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.000]  It was leaked. That was about a week ago.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:28.000]  And they have acknowledged that they have been 1600, 1600 soldiers, national guard and armed forces, which have been killed in action.
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000]  I use their words, killed in action in the Donbass region.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  Oh, yeah. They bragged last week that they had killed in two days.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  They claimed a thousand rebels with their fighter bombers in eastern Ukraine.
[01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  But then we saw the footage. It was just smoking neighborhoods.
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000]  So they're just, look, they're just bombing neighborhoods.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:59.000]  Well, I think there are different sources of data coming from different entities of the Ukrainian state apparatus.
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:05.000]  But what I was referring to was their soldiers. And that's a lie.
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  It's their soldiers which have been decimated. They've killed, they acknowledged the civilian deaths.
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  They've killed a lot of people, more than five or six hundred according to their figures.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000]  Yeah, they say six hundred.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.000]  The problem is that there we have a major war theater.
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  When 1600 soldiers are killed, we're not talking about a, you know, a small crisis in, we're talking about a big theater war.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  And that's my next question to you. That's my next question to you.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:38.000]  There's a delusional disconnect. Even soldiers like Hitler and Napoleon made miscalculations and attacked Russia.
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:47.000]  But I look at Obama, I look at the guys, even at the Rand Corporation, I look at the West and they literally put out white papers how we can survive a nuclear war.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  Brzezinski talks about how they're going to encircle and bring down Russia.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000]  They've got color revolutions inside Russia trying to overthrow it.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I mean, let's just say Putin's a bad guy, which I'm not even saying, but just for the argument, still we're starting it.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  Our leaders are starting it and poking a bear with nuclear weapons.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  And, and, and then Russia is not backing down.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  And I'm afraid our elites are so delusional with their red carpets and having sex with Hollywood stars that they're so decadent, professor, that this is the kind of leadership you get that ends up causing a huge disaster.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  Well, I think Alex, the issue is that these people ultimately believe their own propaganda.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  And I've been analyzing the nuclear weapons doctrine for over 10 years since they they reclassified nuclear weapons as as conventional as let's say they said tactical nuclear weapons can be used in the conventional war.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  Their theater because quote, according to scientific opinion, they are harmless to the surrounding civilian population.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  And so that the three star general in the US central command can place the order.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  Let's use them.
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  They're part of the military toolbox and they're harmless to civilian to civilians.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.000]  They constitute a humanitarian bomb.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  Now, I can say, without any doubt, if there's nuclear confrontation, whether it is with with Russia or with or with Iran, because Iran has been threatened off and on in the course of the last 12 years.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  If there is the use of preemptive of a preemptive nuclear strike, we are in a world war three scenario.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  And we have to I think the the the main culprit of this of this world war three scenario.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  Of course, we can blame the Pentagon.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  We can blame the White House, but without the propaganda machine, without the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and CNN and the Council of Foreign Relations.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  They don't have a leg to stand on.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  Well, I think they have no conscience.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  Like Carl Rove said, we control reality.
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  We're history's actors now.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:15.000]  And I see statements like that out of the White House today.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  I agree with you.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  I think I think they're disconnected and have megalomania.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:29.000]  Well, the nuclear wars is is the is the last war that will have in our history.
[01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  It is it is a war which will destroy humanity.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  I think that's very well understood.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  It was predicted by Einstein many years back.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  I want to talk about that with Professor Michelle Chassadowski, an expert on nuclear proliferation and nuclear war.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  We're going to talk about his book that predicted a lot of this.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:51:13.000]  And I'm telling you, folks, I'm telling you, it's in the cards that if NATO starts hitting Russian forces and then tacticals start getting used, it'll go worldwide instantly.

[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  Folks, we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse.

[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:43.000]  If you move decidedly and develop a backup plan immediately, proportionately more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than at any time in history.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  And history is about to repeat itself.

[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  Professor Michelle Chassadowski is our guest level research.ca.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  Long term is where I'm really worried about this turning into nuclear war, but we almost saw it back on 888 with the whole staged event in Georgia which turned out to be a hoax.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  And then the Georgian troops attacked the Russian held obsidian and other areas, South Ossetian and Abkhazia.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  And even I, that first day, was saying how dare Russia attack because I couldn't believe CNN would just totally lie, the clown news network.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  They have a poll out on CNN where 10% of Americans, it's actually 11%, want to have war with Russia.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:08.000]  Well, that means nuclear war. And I just don't understand the total disconnect.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  What are your biggest concerns concerning nuclear war?
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  And then in closing, what are ideas for detente and to try to reverse this?
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  Well, Alex, I think first of all, this whole notion that we're in a new Cold War is a fallacy.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  The Cold War had certain mechanisms of consultation and dialogue. There was diplomacy. There were safeguards.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  Nuclear war was considered, or nuclear weapons was considered the weapon of last resort under the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  But following the 2002 Senate decision, these nuclear weapons can be used in the conventional war theater.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  And they do not require the consent of the of the commander in chief, namely president of the United States.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:18.000]  We are in an extremely dangerous situation because the decision makers are not, as I said, decision makers are also the victims of propaganda.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  It's not by accident that in the United States, there were these top off, you know, terrorist warnings and exercises. Okay, there's a procedure for top officials.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  But the top officials are being fed from within a whole series of lies and fabrications, not the ones that we read in the media.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  And they are being nurtured into believing their own lies. They're believing their own lies.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  They call it echo chamber.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  Well, for me, it's what I call it's the American Inquisition. It's a bit like the Spanish or French Inquisition with nuclear weapons.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  But I mean, everybody agrees with the Spanish Inquisition, even if the lies are there, you say, okay, the lies too bad for the lies in the York Times and the State Department.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000]  We still support the Spanish Inquisition. In this case, it's the American Inquisition.
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  It's an inquisitorial doctrine whereby you don't necessarily need to hide your lies anymore.
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:28.000]  You just say, well, you better accept the lies because that's the truth.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  And realities are turned upside down. We could call it Orwellian, but it goes even beyond that.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  And the problem is that any kind of scientific analysis will tell you that the use of nuclear weapons on a so-called preemptive basis will lead to World War Three.
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  Yet our decision makers don't seem to understand that.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:20.000]  But at the same time, the defense contractors are complicit, because I recall, and it's in my book, that it was on the 7th or 8th, on the 6th of August 2003, the Pentagon together with the big defense contractors, Lockheed Martin et al.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:35.000]  They met at strategic command headquarters in Nebraska, and on the purpose of this meeting was the development of the nuclear weapons industry, and essentially it was the...
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  We're going to write for 60 seconds. We'll just finish that and get into solutions.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  Five more minutes, then your phone calls, folks, for the whole next hour, third hour coming up.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:49.000]  Chase and Allen and Terry and Bill, Michigan Patriot.
[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:59.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest-purity iodine available.
[01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the Earth.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  Experience the new formula.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  Experience the ancient purity.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  Shield your family.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.000]  Survival Shield X2, available now at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  Or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Your calls are coming up the next seven.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  We've got five more minutes with Professor Michelle Chastadoski, levelresearch.org.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  And he was getting into meetings. I remember one of these meetings happening and it started coming out in the newspapers.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  But you know, using Nuke's tactical ones on a routine basis, using them against Iran, using them on Iraq, using them in Afghanistan, it's no big deal.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  Kind of like leaking reactors are now no big deal.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  And it shows a real nihilistic disconnect in my view.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  So I was asking him about this real danger.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  And he said, yes, if you just joined us, this is worse than the Cold War, because the red telephones aren't being used.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  And now the West is promoting a survivable war with Russia.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  And it's not good because it's driving Russia and China together.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  I really see the soft power of America being lost.
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000]  And I'm very sad for my country because this is all being done in our name.
[02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  And but as you said, NATO and Europe is going along with it.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  Is this just a real sign of serious decadence?
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  Well, it's, I think it's the sign.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:39.000]  Well, let me put it in broader terms.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  Lying is a money making proposition.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  People who lie make money.
[02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000]  People who produce nuclear weapons make money.
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  It is a profit driven military agenda which could lead to the destruction of humanity without the incentive to make money out of this.
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:15.000]  The world would be much, much more sane because the scientists were hired by the Pentagon to say that nuclear weapons are harmless to the surrounding civilian population.
[02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  I have the documents on file.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  Okay.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:35.000]  The big defense contractors meet behind closed doors with the Pentagon at strategic command headquarters in Nebraska in August 2003 to commemorate the Hiroshima bombing.
[02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  Okay.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  On the same day to commemorate, not to say we're sorry, we did it.
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  But to say we're going to commemorate that with a view to developing more nuclear weapons so that nuclear weapons are good for business.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:03.000]  You can look at the, the multi-billion contracts to build these, these nuclear weapons, not to mention the, you know, the, the, the fighter jets that go with it, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:13.000]  And which literally involve a very hard, a very heavy cost to US taxpayers because virtually everything else is wiped out.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  I want to spend a minute and a half, sir, on solutions.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  I mean, how are things going for the globalist?
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  And what are some solutions?
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  Well, I mean, to discuss solutions at this stage is, is, is complex, but I think we have to target the mainstream media.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:39.000]  We have to dismantle the media propaganda, which sustains this agenda, because that is their legitimacy.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:43.000]  If they don't have it, they, they can't, they, they can't lie on their own.
[02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000]  They need the New York Times.
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000]  They need the Wall Street Journal.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  And that is why I think independent alternative media is so important.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:04:03.000]  It's, it's the media battle, which is ultimately crucial. And I, and I think that anti-war activists have to broaden their thrust.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  They have to network across the land throughout the United States, irrespective of political cleavages.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:19.000]  Join hands, examine the truth, examine the facts and, and make up your own mind.
[02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  But essentially we have to dismantle the mainstream media and its fabrications, as well as its odious discourse,
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:37.000]  which we've heard in recent days, which says that, in fact, it doesn't really matter if we torture people or whether we kill them.
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000]  Those people are subhuman and they are terrorists.
[02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:49.000]  And in fact, incidentally, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, on his website of the embassy,
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  they actually said that, that ethnic Russians and Ukraine were subhuman and they have to kill them.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  Yeah, I saw that. Professor, thank you so much.
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  Thank you very much.
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  Thank you very much.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:07.000]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes,
[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others,
[02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  Super male vitality by InfoWarsLife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000]  It's not just the super male vitality.
[02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000]  All the products in InfoWarsLife.com are simply amazing.

[02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:03.000]  City of Austin tap water versus filtered City of Austin tap water.
[02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000]  I didn't taste dirt in it.
[02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000]  God knows what's in this.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  These people just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered through the Cropure G2.0 filtration system.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000]  That one is better.
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000]  Tastes like nothing.
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  Yep, I know what a good water tastes like. It's good water.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others.
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues,
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000]  including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  The Cropure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances,
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  Okay, this is very tasty.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  It's good water.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  Refreshing.
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  It's good.

[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  In what has been dubbed the Survival Silver Solution,

[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000]  body and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:46.000]  you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of diionized

[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:28.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  I'm going to make it clear one more time and then go to your phone calls.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000]  I love America. I love our republic.
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000]  I believe we're a special nation, sea to shining sea.
[02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  And the numbers are there to prove it that this country has revolutionized the world
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000]  have been a trailblazer.
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  But what happens when you're a great place?
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  The criminals, the control freaks come in and they take it over.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  Here's a great analogy that I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:07.000]  When my mother grew up in Austin, Texas, back in the 50s and 60s, early 60s and went to college,
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000]  there was about 40,000 people here.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  And she lived down by UT in what you would call basically downtown.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:22.000]  The capital was the technical downtown.
[02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:29.000]  When I moved here, when I was a junior in high school, there was about 350,000 people here.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.000]  And now 20 something years later, I'm 40 years old.
[02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:39.000]  It's about 25 years later, 23 years later.
[02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000]  There is a million three metro.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  And it's estimated by 2025 Austin will have 3 million people here.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000]  Maybe more.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  And I'm nothing against these people, but they're not what I'd call Texans.
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000]  The Californians.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  And I'm broad brushing here.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  Some of the folks from other socialist utopias.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:11.000]  That they're fleeing the high taxes, the regulations of bureaucracy.
[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  They're fleeing here with lower taxes, less regulation and turning it into a hell.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  Where down the road, I might have to leave a lot of Austinites.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  I've known.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  Have left a lot of famous people have left a lot of cool people have left because all the vampires of the nation,
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  all the empty people that didn't think they would be somebody.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  They couldn't be a Hollywood star or a hip hop star have moved to L.A.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Failed because it's all a big fraud.
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000]  Hollywood collapsing.
[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:56.000]  That's in the news today or summer on record because we're in a depression.
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  That's the main reason.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  And they're moving here like refugees.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  In fact, they are refugees from trendiness.
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:14.000]  And they're not changing the culture that destroyed them.
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  They're doubling down.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000]  That's the thing about a loser.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:24.000]  That's never won the lottery, but keeps thinking, you know, they're going to get their bills paid off by winning the lottery.
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  That's one chance out of 10 million or whatever it is.
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  And if you buy a lot of ticket to have fun, sometimes that's fine.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  I'm not judging you do what you want.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000]  But we know about degenerate gamblers and the people on welfare and the kids are starving at home and mama's there.
[02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  She's been in half her paycheck on lottery tickets.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  And when she doesn't get her money back, she goes back in and does it again.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  We all know and it's that mentality that I see with people that I know that have actually gone crazy.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  I want to make a whole film about this.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000]  If I had the time and energy where they believe they're going to be rock stars.
[02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:03.000]  And when they're not, they go crazy and start announcing they are a rock star and walking around talking to themselves.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:16.000]  Or who get a Nigerian email and give $5,000 to it and then go crazy believing that there really is a Prince of Boopy that's going to give a million dollars and their ship has come in.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  Your ship has come in when you work hard, take action, have good ideas and work with others to build a system.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:28.000]  Ships don't just come in magically overnight.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:32.000]  There's not enough slots to be a professional baseball player, basketball player, football player.
[02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:38.000]  There's not enough slots to be a dictator like Obama wants to be.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:47.000]  There's only slots and having a free open trailblazing society and being an honorable person and a good father, a good mother.
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000]  And building a better world.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000]  And that's an inside job.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  That takes being a moral person on your own.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000]  You're not going to get it by going to a name it and claim it church.
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:09.000]  That sits there and tells you just believe in what we tell you and do whatever we say and don't get politically involved and the whole world's going to fix itself.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:17.000]  That's like Oprah Winfrey's The Secret that she promotes.
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:21.000]  You don't just imagine that a well is going to appear in your backyard.
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000]  You have to imagine that there's water down there.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:32.000]  Know you're over an aquifer and then hand dig it down 200 feet and then you got a well that will serve 20 generations.
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  You don't just imagine a hole gets dug in the ground.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000]  Trust in God but tie up your camel.
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:44.000]  I'm going to chase Alan, Terry, Bill, Michigan Patriots and others in a moment when you hear somebody hang up.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:47.000]  That's your chance to get involved on air.
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000]  But I love this country.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  But I'm criticizing the globalist scallywag carpet bagging.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000]  I don't mean that a northerner sense.
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  There are smart people in California, smart people in New York, smart people in Michigan, smart people in Indiana, smart people in Florida.
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:09.000]  I'm not saying Texans are the best of the best or anything.
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  I'm just saying, oh, I thought growing up everybody was like the old fashioned Texans I knew.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  Some of them were corrupt and would cheat you but nobody hung out with them and everybody wanted to be upright because you were upright.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000]  And then society opened up to you because society needs good people.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:35.000]  And that's what everybody's looking for is honorable men to work with and honorable women.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  But all these trendies think backstabbing, cheating, lying, betraying, making stuff up, being drama queens.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  It's how you get ahead.
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000]  And that's not how you get ahead.
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  It's how you blackball yourself.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  And America is being blackballed worldwide now for being known as people you could work with and people that would get the job done and people that were tough and smart and had the patents and had the trailblazing and had the bravada and the guts that it took.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000]  And to now being known as you don't want to work with Americans, they won't get the job done.
[02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.000]  They'll stab you in the back.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  They want a free ride.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  That's the stuff that third world countries are made of.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:24.000]  Class envy, socialism, class warfare and everything else we see.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  So when I hear these criticisms all over national news that, you know, Alex Jones loves Pooty-Poot and all the rest of it and Alex Jones doesn't like America because he doesn't want to, you know, fund ISIS or whatever.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000]  Give me a break.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  It's not good for our country to be the bad guy bullying other nations, starting wars, overthrowing Ukraine.
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000]  That's what happened.
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000]  Does that mean the Russians are perfect or even good?
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000]  No, but they didn't start it.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  And it's in their backyard, not ours.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:16:00.000]  And the same globalist trying to bring down Russia, trying to put a new government in to tell Russians not to have kids.
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  The Russians are down to 1.3 children per parent, per family.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  There'll be no Russians soon if that continues.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000]  I mean, it's simple things like that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:23.000]  Our government wants us to abort all our children here, but then bring in totally unskilled bots that can be programmed by the state, their new family.
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  This is a sick takeover by un-American outsiders who are totally against our former system of government.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  That isn't perfect, but let me tell you, is heaven and is utopia compared to what they're creating.
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  Everybody knows that if you feed and domesticate animals, they turn into lazy slobs.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  Look at the fat monkeys of Japan.
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:53.000]  Just type that in.
[02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.000]  Obese monkeys, Japan.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.000]  And you'll see where the public feeds these monkeys at these watering holes that can hardly walk.
[02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000]  They look like the average American.
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  That's what we've become, and I'm going the other direction away from it.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000]  Yeah, there are the photos.
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.000]  That top right-hand corner one is the poster child for our country.
[02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  That's us.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000]  And you know what?
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000]  Let's admit what we've become.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000]  I'm going to go to break, come right back.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  Everybody else has been holding.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000]  What do you think the biggest issue is right now?
[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:33.000]  You can talk about the border collapsing and the Russia situation, the Al-Qaeda situation,
[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  the dollar being devalued, but who's behind it in every case?
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  Who sets the policy to do it and brags?
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000]  The Federal Reserve.
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  Who's that?
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000]  The big mega banks, most of them foreign.
[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  Who funds the anti-gun control groups?
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  Who funds Mecha and La Raza?
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:49.000]  Who funds the abortion?
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  Who funds Heather has two mommies?
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:58.000]  99% of the time, it's Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  Bank of America, Wells Fargo.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000]  It goes right down the line, folks.
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000]  George Soros.
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  These people are bad news.
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  Bad news.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000]  And they have hatred for you and your family.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  And it's time that we shop together.
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000]  It's time that we promote each other.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000]  It's time that we promote our culture of liberty.
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  It's time we tell people about others that are telling the truth.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  And it's time we shun and don't support the establishment.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  I didn't even plug anything last hour.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.000]  This hour is brought to you by MyPatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex,

[02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  We haven't had the Silver Bullet Super Colloidal Silver in for a couple, two and a half months.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000]  We got a limited supply of that in.
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000]  I could buy it anywhere from these other companies.
[02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  I wanted the best.
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000]  And let me tell you, it's good, and it's a lower price than competitors.

[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000]  Win-win, win-win-win.
[02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000]  Silver Bullet, the Naysan Iodine, X2, all of it.

[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  But don't be fooled into believing all silver is the same.

[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000]  Will the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me?
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:49.000]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.

[02:23:52.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  MyPatriotSupply.com.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:18.000]  Obama did a bad, bad thing.
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  Maybe it's a bad, bad thing.
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.000]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls, Chase. Thanks for holding.
[02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000]  What do you think the number one crisis of this whole bucket of crises is right now?
[02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000]  Well, I don't know, sir. I mean, they're throwing it all at us,
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  but I think just starting in our own backyard first,
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:51.000]  allowing the influx of the children, and as Christians, they use our kindness for weakness
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000]  and giving them the germs and everything.
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.000]  I personally think, you know, using the recipe of problem-reaction solution,
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  say maybe around October or so, or whenever they can say up,
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  well, they've gone through the proper steps and now they've taken the computer chip.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  I think that's how they're going to justify chipping the people
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000]  and getting these fully-belowing Christians, you know, the ones that stepped in
[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  like a bunch of grinning possums on TV who, I guess, I can't remember what the scripture is,
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:27.000]  but it's like white-washed sepulchres with dead men's bones inside.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.000]  And it's not, and don't get me wrong, I'm not judging.
[02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  I'm just, I'm dirty rags, too, but...
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  No, but you can see the premeditated evil.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.000]  You know, they're telling us that they want to chip the troops.
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000]  They want them brain chips to make them behave.
[02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000]  And, you know, don't give them ideas.
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.000]  I think if they said we're putting chips in the kids for the children,
[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000]  the churches would probably hail Satan and do it if they were told to by Obama.
[02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000]  I was in a CVS story yesterday and saw all these anti-Obama cards in there.
[02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  So that shows how popular disliking Obama is.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000]  And I know he's a puppet, but if people can say no to the puppet
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000]  that was supposed to be our Lord and Savior according to Time Magazine and Jamie Foxx,
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  we can wake up to anything then. Great points, Chase.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alan in Florida.
[02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000]  Oh, by the way, before we go to Alan,
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:22.000]  Pew Research report nearly 90% of illegal immigrant children are teenagers.
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.000]  I think the number one crisis we're facing right now
[02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:37.000]  is an implosion of the Federal Reserve and the central banking system in the nuclear age.
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000]  About a week ago, I was driving down I-95.
[02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000]  I saw signs for Jekyll Island.
[02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  I know spending the entire next day exploring the island.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000]  And to walk around this very beautiful but very creepy place
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  where literally AT&T wireless phones display the wrong time zone
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000]  and to know all this is going on in Ukraine and Russia,
[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.000]  to know that we've got our bombers loaded, the Russian subs, the American subs are loaded,
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  and to walk into the Jekyll Island Hunting Club Hotel
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  and walk in the room where J.P. Morgan and the representative of the Rothschild family
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  and a U.S. senator and the U.S. treasurer met secretly in a meeting that began on 10-10-10.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000]  It just makes it all so real, Alex.
[02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  You need to go there. If you haven't, it's just overwhelming.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000]  Well, you can rent rooms there where they had the secret meeting back in 1913
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000]  to set up the private Federal Reserve, the income tax,
[02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000]  and to get U.S. senators to not be elected by the legislature
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000]  but to be sent to be federal kings, federal legates.
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  I've been invited to speak there when Liberty Grips have met there repeatedly.
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  I'm just always tied down running operations here,
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000]  but that is somewhere I would like to visit someday
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  and broadcast from the Jekyll Island facility
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  and go into the Hunting Club bar area and maybe even talk to them and broadcast from there
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000]  because it's important to realize they met in secret for a reason.
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  Bilderberg meets in secret for a reason because what they're doing is criminal.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  Great points, Alan. Terry in Virginia. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  Hi, Alex. I have two things that are really heavy on my heart right now.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  One, of course, the border issue and this formation of the North American Union.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:34.000]  Another is I have really had on my heart to issue a challenge
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000]  to my fellow Liberty University graduates.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  I am so frustrated with sitting in church and I love my pastor
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:48.000]  and I love listening to the word, but all this stuff is going on in the world
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  and it's totally being ignored, you know, within the church.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.000]  My pastor will mention things every now and then, which I give him some credit
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  on the side. He really is, you know, into some of this.
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.000]  He's afraid to speak it out in the church because he might, you know, ruffle some feathers or whatever.
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000]  Oh, I know. People think it's a smart move not to speak out.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000]  That's why we're going to lose everything. People have to speak out about it all
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000]  and speak out together.
[02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:15.000]  It's like I told my friend that Lois Down in Portsmouth, she's, you know,
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:19.000]  we've been friends for 30 years and I said, you know, I believe in the rapture
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  and I believe all the descriptions are being fulfilled.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  I said, but that doesn't mean that we won't be sitting in a FEMA camp
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  when the Lord comes back.
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:31.000]  So we better speak up and stand up for what we think is right
[02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:32.000]  and stand up for our country.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000]  Well, yeah, what about all the unborn kids?
[02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000]  I mean, let's say you're going to get teleported out of here next week.
[02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  What about all the kids getting butchered? What about all the tyrannies?
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  Look, it's state-run religion is what it is.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  I'm not saying you're preacher state-run, but he regurgitates kind of what the popular saying is.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.000]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000]  We'll be back with more calls. Thank you so much, Jerry.
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:56.000]  I begin to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much,
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000]  get healthy and detoxify.
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:03.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:08.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:11.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:15.000]  You now know it as Survival Shield, true medicine.
[02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:21.000]  Iodine that your body can really absorb.
[02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful,
[02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals,
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  and the results that I personally have had have been life-changing.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:37.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com,
[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000]  the radio show, the TV show, the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of Survival Shield X2.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:56.000]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off Super Detox Special at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:59.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Group.
[02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:06.000]  It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:13.000]  The new Survival Shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the earth
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million-plus year-old deposit deep in the earth.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today.
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:36.000]  It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000]  Experience the new formula.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  Experience the ancient purity.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000]  Shield your family.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:47.000]  Survival Shield X2, available now at InfowarsLife.com.
[02:31:47.000 --> 02:32:05.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:18.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:44.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:51.000]  The new InfowarsLife Lung Cleans is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:58.000]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll 3-888-2533139.
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  Music
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:13.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:22.000]  Music
[02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:28.000]  Chitter Jennings bringing us in. It's got a new album coming out soon. I want to get him on.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:34.000]  The Death Machine. It's growing.
[02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  Let's turn up a minute or so of this and go back to your phone calls.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:42.000]  Gas mask.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  Music
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  Came out with this three years ago as Stephen King of all people.
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:06.000]  Music
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:12.000]  It's nothing but the love in your mama's eyes.
[02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:18.000]  Music
[02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  We are back live. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. This is Summer of Rage, Chitter Jennings.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.000]  Music
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  Hank Williams Jr. is a listener too. And Hank Williams III.
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:36.000]  In fact, how many great listeners we've got out there. Hank Williams III is pretty wild though.
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  I think Hank Williams is pretty wild too and then Hank Williams Jr. was pretty wild.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:43.000]  So is Hank Williams Jr. the third or whatever it is.
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:49.000]  Alright folks, it is of course Wednesday the 23rd day of July 2014.
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  Kit Daniels has been working on a story. I have a source inside Homeland Security that told me this month ago.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  Then it was in the news a few weeks ago that the United Nations is saying call them refugees.
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  And the United Nations is advising Homeland Security as if that's where Obama gets his authority to put our military under NATO.
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:21.000]  It's from the UN. Congress complains. Obama says fly a kite, jump in the lake and something else three times.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:27.000]  Congress says you're not supposed to violate article one section out of the Constitution and become the head of the UN Security Council.
[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  Nobody ever done that before. And Obama tells them jump in the lake.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:35.000]  New American reports the UN pushes it doesn't any legals.
[02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:38.000]  Immigrants from Central America as refugees.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  Townhall.com. Same deal.
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  Well, we have a border patrol source and also another talk show host has another source with the UNHRC.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  That the UN is down there. And I know they sent advisors down there, but the UN is running the show.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  And because politicians always when they're doing some type of crime want to have some other group certify that it's okay what they're doing.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  And so you go to the UN for that.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.000]  And so Kit's about to break an article.
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:22.000]  The next five minutes on infowars.com, I just read over it and I don't usually approve stuff, but he wanted me to go over it with him.
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  And so that's going up in a matter of minutes at infowars.com.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  Kit, bring Kit back in here.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000]  I want to look at that headline before we go live with it.
[02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:36.000]  Again, I'm having to multitask here and we're going to your phone calls.
[02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  Briefly, again, I didn't plug anything in the middle hour, so I'm plugging twice this hour.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:48.000]  This hour is brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex, the best high quality, storeable foods out there.
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  Bar none, great customer service, non-GMO, high quality, 866-229-0927, mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:05.000]  And it's not just the quality of the food, it's the great packaging they've got, these plastic tote bags that are even reusable.
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  They're really professional, really nice.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.000]  And so mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex.
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  And then don't forget we have a 25% special running right now.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:27.000]  25% special running on the fluoride shield that is the nascent iodine with five other chelating ingredients to detox the body.
[02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:39.000]  And then we've also got the original survival shield, 25% off with it together at infowarslife.com or call toll 3-888-253-3139.
[02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:44.000]  And the 1776 sale for the month of July obviously ends in about six, seven days.
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:51.000]  Huge discounts on all the Made in America apparel, the belt buckles, the Molan Labe shirts and belt buckles, all of it.
[02:37:51.000 --> 02:38:00.000]  Made in 1776.com or just go to infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000]  Yeah, this is an excellent headline.
[02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:07.000]  Border Patrol whistleblower or Border Patrol agents, UN taking control of America's southern border.
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:11.000]  Now we've got reporters on the way down there right now.
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:16.000]  We've got our source that I need to get you back in touch with just to get more.
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000]  We need to do blackout interviews with these people because that has more credibility.
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:21.000]  It's more theatrical.
[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000]  We've got to somehow let people go.
[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  Border Patrol told us kids in here four months ago that their order to stand down, we're busing them in.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  But no one picked it up.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000]  It didn't get the attention until we got the video.
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  So I said a $5,000 bounty.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:46.000]  I need to put this down on paper for whoever gets the National Guard, grabbing the illegals and then delivering them to ICE and then showing the chain as in the buses roll out a day later.
[02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  We need to show as people get, see Rick Perry's putting Border Patrol down there to be a red carpet butlers for the illegals.
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000]  Okay.
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.000]  So, you know, that came out back in October.
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000]  So it's more than four months, four months as they said it again.
[02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  So I guess how long it was was October, nine months ago, 10 months ago.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000]  So we know this to be true.
[02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  But the $5,000 bounty goes, not just whoever gets that footage, another $5,000 bounty.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.000]  We need an article about this maybe tomorrow, codifying it.
[02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  And my sole discretion, I pay that $100,000 prices, folks.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  I pay every one of them.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:25.000]  It's real.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  But the legalese, I'm the sold person.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.000]  I will choose if it's real, if it's legitimate, if it's certified footage, showing the chain of custody.
[02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:37.000]  $5,000, whoever shows that, $5,000.
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:40.000]  Whoever gets video of the UN people and gets them to admit their UN.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:45.000]  And that means after you videotape them, follow them into a bar at night with a recorder.
[02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  It means doing whatever you got to do to save this country from the globalist, okay?
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000]  I mean, this is war, people.
[02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  This is a war.
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000]  Everything is legal and lawful.
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  But you're going to have to be the human.
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:02.000]  They have these images of James Bond that beats up 300 guys in a movie and is invincible.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000]  That's not how it works, folks.
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000]  It's regular people getting the job done.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000]  You're not going to get some little decoder ring from the CIA.
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000]  You're not going to meet with the FBI.
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  They don't want you to save the country.
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000]  Some of their own people might want you to.
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000]  You're going to have to go out and be a journalist.
[02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:22.000]  You can do just as good as we're doing.
[02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  Who's the guys that got this interview with the Border Patrol head about how this is asymmetrical warfare?
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000]  What, bonanza media?
[02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000]  Little bonanza.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000]  Did a first-rate job.
[02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:33.000]  You're all media.
[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000]  You're all journalists.
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  But operate one-half journalist, one-half counter-revolutionary spy.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000]  And let me tell you, just know you're in the right.
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  Being in good mood.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  Get the job done.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.000]  I've snuck into, you name it, folks, secret military operations, Bohemian Grove.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000]  Nobody ever got in and out.
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  They arrested scores of people.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000]  I'm nothing special, but I knew the mission was important.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  So I had a lot of confidence to talk to the Secret Service and the rest of them.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.000]  And I got the job done.
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  And my reporters do that.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  We're on a mission.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.000]  Like the Blues Brothers say, we're on a mission from God.
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  And I'm telling you, that's what you got to do.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000]  I want the U.N. on video.
[02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000]  And I want the whistleblowers.
[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:16.000]  I want it all.
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  $10,000 in prizes.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  And I know you don't need the incentive, but it just shows the value of celebrating independent media and the competitiveness of it.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  I should have the M4 Wars or Alex Jones prize every year if we can raise the money, depending on the year, at least $25,000.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  And have it be a year-long prize like the Pulitzer Prize.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000]  Pulitzer was involved in yellow journalism with Hearst.
[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000]  That's what's so funny.
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000]  It's like the Nobel is a joke.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:53.000]  Give it to Al Gore and every other criminal.
[02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000]  Now, these are the notes from when I said yesterday about it.
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000]  Anyways, Kit, great headline. Is it going live yet?
[02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  Launch the story right now. Great job.
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:10.000]  And when you buy the books, the videos, the t-shirts, when you buy the nation eye and eye, when you buy the super male vitality, let me tell you something.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:17.000]  The super female vitality with women.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  Made Leigh Ann sleepy at first for about a week.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:23.000]  And then, you know, she said it had a different effect. She had to stop taking it.
[02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:30.000]  The point is, I don't know one woman that has taken this, who hadn't got more energy, more stamina, and other things.
[02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:38.000]  So I'm telling you, support the show and get a bottle of super female vitality for your wife or girlfriend, and it will blow you away.
[02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  And I didn't get into this to sell aphrodisiacs.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  It was advertised with the male vitality as stamina, lose weight, work out, feel great.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000]  It isn't mimic testosterone. It gets your body to release it.
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  Female vitality, because it's cold, pressed, organic, only has two other ingredients to the male.
[02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.000]  And quite frankly, it works on men too. In fact, the men are now just ordering the female vitality.
[02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:05.000]  Just whatever your flavor is. Just try them both out. Know you're supporting the Info War.
[02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  So I can have prizes, have reporters. I just want to dominate the enemy.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000]  I want to kick their butt.
[02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:21.000]  So tell five people a day about the show. Email your friends and family. Post our stories to Facebook to Pinterest to...
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000]  I always have that moment where I can't remember the name of it that everybody uses.
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:29.000]  That's Instagram, YouTube. Keep doing it.
[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:33.000]  And we'll destroy their false bots with humat, human intelligence.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:40.000]  We will defeat the machines. The war against the machines, by the way, is going on now with these computers and these systems.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.000]  And these megaphone systems and these fake bots and the Pentagon.
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.000]  Now, the Pentagon, humans are mad and don't like what's happening. Almost all of them.
[02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.000]  Over 85% on the streets and all the knowledge that I talk to, they're good people.
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.000]  That's why they're so freaked out, because they're seeing the humat end where there's checks and balances,
[02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  and they're bringing in the total digital, warmock computers that poses humans online.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000]  That's in the news, declassified, leaked, you name it.
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  We, billions of humans, can overwhelm and smash their system.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:15.000]  If you believe we can beat them, if you believe we have the power.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  Congress, 7% approval rating. Media, 9% approval rating.
[02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:27.000]  Darth Vader is now polling higher than all potential 2016 presidential candidates.
[02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:35.000]  That's why folks like Putin, because despite the fact he's obviously a thug and probably a killer and a whole nine yards,
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:41.000]  he has made Russia better overall and he runs around shooting guns with a shirt off and dating the most beautiful women in Russia.
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  I mean, people are sick of, you know, Obama who's running around, you know, telling us to turn our guns in.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  People, people want women that are women, men that are men.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:58.000]  If you're into something else, that's the issue. I don't hate you, but we're sick of being domesticated.
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  We want John Wayne back. Not that he was perfect, but we want that.
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000]  We don't want this.
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michigan Patriot. Thanks for holding.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  Hello, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, how are you doing, brother?
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:29.000]  Hey, earlier you had asked what the biggest crisis was and I'm telling you what my firm belief is and I have a comment and I'd like your take on it after I make that comment.
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:45.000]  Yes. I think the biggest, biggest crisis we have right now is mainstream media and how they're suppressing the truth and how they're manipulating the populace.
[02:45:45.000 --> 02:46:03.000]  And what I mean by that is I was woken up by you, believe it or not, when you let the crack and lose over at the Boston bombing incident.
[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  And that's when I really started looking at independent media and that changed me dramatically because I started looking at different things.
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:23.000]  I started realizing that there was more going on that I was being told.
[02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:41.000]  And I guess what I mean by all this is if info wars did not exist, if judge report did not exist, if these independent media operations did not exist, where would this world be?
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:58.000]  Where would we be if there was info wars back when the Tonkin incident happened, when the Kennedy assassination happened?
[02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:03.000]  Where would we be? Well, how different would the world have changed?
[02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:26.000]  And I think it's extremely important that people really understand how important your show, Drudge Report, Savage, I really think people really need to understand that they're getting fed stuff from talking points.
[02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  And more so now, because Hillary said, hey, we're losing the info war, they know it.
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:57.000]  And I think that's the biggest crisis with everything going on right now. We have so many problems around the world with Israel right now, with the border, with the economy.
[02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:06.000]  And by the way, there are UN connected groups that get Hamas to shoot those rockets off so that Israel responds politically. And people say, well, which side are you on?
[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  The whole thing's contrived by the puppet masters. We need to start looking at the big picture, not at what we're being told to freak out about.
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  And it's a real tragedy. I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  Imagine the world without the printing press, we'd still be in the dark ages. And then imagine where we would be today without info wars or prison planet or Drudge or without Ted Cruz or Rand Paul.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:43.000]  I mean, we barely beat the gunband in the Senate and wouldn't have done it without alternative libertarian media and without those senators.
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:49.000]  And that's what's scary. We're barely beating them over and over again, barely beating them.
[02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  So they just said, hey, we'll just open the borders completely outside of law. We'll just start arresting tea party people outside of law and admitted we're doing it to persecute them.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  I mean, because the authoritarian left can't get what they want right now, they're just cheating openly, which is a big risk to them.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:16.000]  And again, I'm not romanticizing the Republican leadership either. They're they're the same group, but they're not in power right now.
[02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  The Democrats have the ball and they're running it towards the end zone right now.
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:25.000]  And we've got to get maximum effort out to keep stopping them.
[02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  And we've got to get the debate going about what's really going on at the border that it's asymmetrical warfare on purpose by design to wreck the country.
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  And not about these poor teenagers coming up here who I don't blame want to be here.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:49.000]  It's about a North American Union and a deal with Mexico, the U.S., Canada and Guatemala to open up the borders and bring in unlimited groups to socially vote to turn the country socialist.
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:59.000]  Period. Ford Foundation on record, Congressman Gutierrez on record, they're coming for us using the cannon fodder.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:05.000]  And it'd be like if I was conscripted in Vietnam, I wouldn't be against the Viet Cong trying to kill me.
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:10.000]  That's the other soldier across the line. But you know what? He's coming for me.
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:17.000]  And it's militarily done. Gutierrez and others say our people must all be legalized, unlimited, or you're racist, and we're going to get your guns.
[02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.000]  It's like no other country acts like this or behaves like this.
[02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  And again, the government shutting the power plants off.
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  The government's putting regulations in to make all the factories move.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:30.000]  It's asymmetrical warfare.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:39.000]  Like I kept saying, Godzilla or Pacific Rim is a fantasy movie about kaijus, you know, big monsters coming out and attacking power plants.
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  Well, why do they attack the power plants to shut off civilization, destroy their enemy?
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  When they shut your power plants off, folks, it's like being bombed by Godzilla.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  I mean, do you understand that? I mean, it's a military operation.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  You can look at it. We're being shot off.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  20-year shelf life and take up to 70% less space than number 10 cans.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000]  They even offer a gluten-free option.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  Oregon Trail Foods and 30dayfoodsupply.com.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:38.000]  Keep prices low by buying directly from the producers in Oregon and then passing the savings to you.
[02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  Purchase a 30-day, 90-serving emergency food supply for only $99 this month and $10 ships your entire order.
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:53.000]  Visit the website at 30dayfoodsupply.com or call 541-229-0010.
[02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:59.000]  That's 30dayfoodsupply.com where they make preparedness affordable, 30dayfoodsupply.com.
[02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:02.000]  Alex Jones here for infowars.com.
[02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  In the month of July, we have got giant specials on everything at maiden1776.com.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:14.000]  The already discounted maiden1776 t-shirts are only 1776.
[02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  We have the new belt buckles that in only two weeks of sale are very close to selling out.
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  500 of each. We're talking about Maiden America belt buckles and nickel brass.
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:30.000]  This is more than a summer blowout special. This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:36.000]  But to expand the info war, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free.
[02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:42.000]  Right now, when you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv, for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.
[02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:46.000]  That's more than five months free off the regular price.
[02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:52.000]  This July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at maiden1776.com.
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:58.000]  Moan Lombay, you can take my gun from my cold, dead, ranch.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:07.000]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  Burglars call it smash and grab. Police call it robbery.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:19.000]  We call it avoidable. We are fake TV, a simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:25.000]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:32.000]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:39.000]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping.
[02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:46.000]  Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV or go to faketv.com.
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:52.000]  That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[02:53:52.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:17.000]  I've been all over the Caribbean and as the crime rate has exploded,
[02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:22.000]  most places that were nice 10 years ago, 20 years ago are pretty hellish now.
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  But one place I've been to that continues to be nice is the beautiful island of Grand Cayman.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  I haven't been to the other little islands, but I went there to check it out.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:38.000]  And of course, it's a place where the elite park their money and a lot of other things, so they don't allow open boards.
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:44.000]  If you don't have a skill, they don't let you in. They allow some immigration and they have one of the lowest crime rates in the Caribbean
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:50.000]  and the place is clean and nice and the people are happy and the people that live there have jobs and are paid well.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  And they've decided like Switzerland to have things be expensive so there's a high standard of living and then the economy just adjusts to that.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:06.000]  The globalists are doing the opposite to us and I should do a whole documentary piece showing that there's been one Caribbean island and another.
[02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:16.000]  I would compare Grand Cayman to Haiti that's nearby and what it's like or used to be Hispaniola, Haiti to the west to the east,
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  Dominican Republic, Dominican Republic's nice compared to Haiti.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.000]  You look at satellite images, Haiti looks like it's been bombed and the other side is nice.
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  It's all what form of governments in place and the globalists want a Chicago collapsed type.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:40.000]  I'm not just Chicago in general. The collapsed bad areas of Chicago is the dream model for America of the Democratic Party.
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:46.000]  Bill in Pennsylvania, you're on the air. We'll go to overdrive and take more calls. Bill, go ahead.
[02:55:46.000 --> 02:56:02.000]  Alex, first time caller. Hey, you had a gentleman on from the American border control a few days ago and he talked to a system that could detect ultra lights coming in over the border and people coming in over the border.
[02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:06.000]  Yes, he's going to our reporters are going there right now.
[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:10.000]  Yeah, I was wondering if that would detect a drone.
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:13.000]  If it was flying low, it would yes.
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.000]  So you could have it for like home protection.
[02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think drones have become this icon of surveillance. They're really the icon of the rise of the machines and automation designing it to displace humans.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:32.000]  I'm all for machines if they empower and augment humans instead of suppressing us.
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:39.000]  It's that the globalist are driving the architecture of the robot revolution.
[02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  Yeah. Okay, I've got a couple questions. I just want to go through the next is I've been sending you some forward some news clips from an Orthodox monk that has been talking about the downing of the plane.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  And he indicated that Putin's plane was in the area during that time.
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:13.000]  Yeah, that was that was first on the Russian news, Interfax and then RT, but then they came out a week later and said that Putin's plane had not flown that route in some time about a year.
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  But the rebels could have or the official government could have done that.
[02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:23.000]  But it's starting to become clear that I may have been wrong saying it was probably the Russians and it was by mistake.
[02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.000]  It's starting to look like the rebels shot it down from the ground or from the air.
[02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000]  So I'm starting to lean that direction.
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.000]  I see. Okay, my next.
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  I'm not the rebels. I mean, they were the rebels, the George Soros Nazi force. Go ahead. I'm sorry. The official Ukrainian government.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.000]  Okay, I got one other question. So I'm really shifting gears here.
[02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:57.000]  What part of the Constitution gives the guys like Harry Reid the ability to change the law in their favor and then accuse others of violating the law?
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:00.000]  But what part of the Constitution allows him to do that?
[02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:03.000]  No part of it. It's arbitrary dictatorship.
[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  And now a lot of members of Congress are taking my lead.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:14.000]  I've said this and calling him a would be dictator doesn't mean dictator for life, but he he's operating as a dictator.
[02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  So it's very, very serious. I appreciate your call.
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:26.000]  I'm going to overdrive for only five minutes. Some stations carry it most down, but I will go to John and I will go to Brent and I will go to Bruce.
[02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  I don't know about Alex because I don't know we can get four calls in, but I'll try.
[02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000]  Each caller will give about a minute or so.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000]  We'll try to get to John, Brent, Bruce and others.
[02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.000]  Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:43.000]  We've got five months free right now. Each membership can be used by 11 people.
[02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:57.000]  PrisonPlanet.tv. I want to thank all the members. Thank you so much. I salute you.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:20.000]  This is more than a summer blowout special. This is a new declaration of independence.
[02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:27.000]  But to expand the info orb, we're offering the equivalent of more than five months free right now.
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:32.000]  And you get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for a limited time, only $39.95 a year.

[02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:42.000]  Not just this July 4th weekend, but the entire month of July at maiden1776.com.
[02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  Molan Lombay. You can take my gun from my cold, dead, inch.
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:58.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:17.000]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:22.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:27.000]  Almost out of time going quick here in overdrive and the big retransmissions coming up.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:30.000]  John in Washington, you're on the air.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.000]  Yeah.
[03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Yes, thanks for taking my call. I call Alex Jones. I want to thank you and the crew for letting us be aware of what the possibility to be.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  And Juan, Eric.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  Yeah, I got to let you go, John. I appreciate you thanking me, but I apologize. Your phone's breaking out.
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:53.000]  I apologize. You're on hold. So I'll call you back tomorrow on a good phone. Go to the head of the line.
[03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  Brent in FEMA Region 6. You're on the air.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  Hey, Alex. Thank you for the overdrive session today.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:09.000]  I really am just calling to ask you a question. I was discussing basically the immigration situation that we're facing right now with the open borders
[03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  and how the president of ICE and a board of directors member from the Border Patrol came out and said that the borders are wide open and that this is a perfect storm.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  Now, with our borders being wide open, I'm curious, do we even qualify as the United States of America?
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  No, no. Technically, the country is collapsing and it's run by traders. And so really effectively, that's why I said this marks the true death point of the country.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  But countries can be resurrected. They're not like people. So it can be reversed. But Rick Perry's the toughest leader we've got, the national news tells us.
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:54.000]  And he says, Obama's dumb. Obama doesn't know what's going on. Obama knows what he's doing.
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:02:02.000]  Thank you so much, Bruce or Brent. Who's up next here, Bruce? Bruce and Michigan, moving quick. Go ahead.
[03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:11.000]  Yeah, thanks. Absolutely. The major crisis is nuclear war. I take this magazine called Chronicles, the Rockford Institute.
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:20.000]  One of their main writers is Sergei Trifkovich. I've been reading him a long time. He says, Putin better act in eastern Ukraine or he will be replaced.
[03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  In either case, we're heading towards a nuclear war. He's thinking neocons within an hour of that plane going down. We're talking about conspiracy kooks trying to keep Putin from taking the blame.
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  That's the difference between now and Syria. I listened to you Sunday. The people aren't going to call in about this like they called in about Syria.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  And I'm sad to say that nuclear war is coming. The neocons have got them hoodwinked. That's it.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  Well, yeah, there is that old hatred of Russia and some people are like, yeah, blow them, Ruskies.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:03:00.000]  And it's just totally mindless. We're run by Nazi collaborator people like George Soros. I mean, literally.
[03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  And I mean, why not blame the border on Putin? Why not blame the dollar evaluation on Putin?
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  Actually, they're trying to blame that on him. He's trying to set up bricks to hurt the dollar. I know the Federal Reserve's doing that.
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  Thank you, Bruce. Dan in FEMA region five. Go ahead. You're on the air.
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:24.000]  Hello, Alex. Hey, I wanted to talk about disinformation for a minute. I was on the drive back. I wasn't able to get your show.
[03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:29.000]  But I did hear this guy, Gary C. Johnson on WKYT, and he was filling up disinformation.
[03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:35.000]  He was pretty much saying about the airplane that started a show out like that. And they said, you know, we can't figure this out.
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  Just best thing you do is give up and I think about it. And being informed is actually needs to be angry is what they're saying.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000]  So I want to throw this out and I don't know how.
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  No, I agree. No one should be involved. Leave the border open. It's all Putin's fault. Turn your guns in. I agree with those talk show hosts.
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. So, yeah, it's just they didn't have any call in. You couldn't call and dispute anything that they had to say or anything.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:06.000]  And I just want to throw it out there. Gary C. Johnson, WKYT.
[03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  Well, I appreciate you for the call. I'm out of time. Sorry to Alex and others. Great job crew.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  I think I've heard of somebody like Tokyo Rose would say similar things. Lay down. Don't worry about it. Everything's going to be OK.
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:30.000]  Unless you don't lay down. The most lazy propaganda is tinfoil hat, flying saucer, or that I'm a fear monger.
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  Like they say, drugs is tabloid with no proof when we links to everything. So they're indicting themselves.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  That's just to make mindless people feel good. I'm effective because I'm getting people awake to the crisis, not fear mongering.
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  The globalist are fear mongering, saying lay down or we'll call you names. People aren't scared of the media anymore.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:05:01.000]  They don't care what these people say. We're going forward. Nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock Central. Be there.
