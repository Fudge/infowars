[00:00.000 --> 00:28.820]  Now things are very very clear 95 days out from the election
[00:28.820 --> 00:34.920]  like we're staring down into the purest pool of mountain spring water you can
[00:34.920 --> 00:40.800]  see right to the bottom 100 feet down what we see swimming around down there
[00:40.800 --> 00:48.200]  globalist eels the news I'm about to announce is the biggest news we've ever
[00:48.200 --> 00:56.440]  announced here on air in this crescendo of incredible developments and
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.760]  information came out last night in this morning and all the pieces click
[01:00.760 --> 01:07.840]  together but I will tell you this I am now going to carry firearms at all
[01:07.840 --> 01:12.240]  times and I normally have the shotguns and things like that an instant access
[01:12.240 --> 01:19.240]  pistol shape by my bed I'm gonna have them even handier now because the threat
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.880]  level in this country to what is known as the leadership of what's left of the
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.840]  American resistance to the globalist takeover is extremely serious now that
[01:30.840 --> 01:34.280]  said here is the giant piece of the puzzle that just went in and completed
[01:34.280 --> 01:42.120]  it President Trump tweeted that with universal mail-in voting not absentee
[01:42.120 --> 01:47.000]  voting which is good the media tries to confuse that 2020 will be the most
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.040]  inaccurate and fraudulent election in history it will be a great embarrassment
[01:53.040 --> 01:58.680]  to the USA delay the election until people can properly securely safely vote
[01:58.680 --> 02:05.760]  I totally agree with the president this is the absolute right move to make now
[02:05.760 --> 02:09.480]  they're gonna say he's authoritarian he's not leaving office they've had his
[02:09.480 --> 02:12.840]  phones tapped that's why they're suddenly talking points he's not gonna
[02:12.840 --> 02:17.040]  leave he's not gonna accept the results of the election because he's being
[02:17.040 --> 02:23.760]  advised by smart people that you cannot allow in over 25 states and over 800
[02:23.760 --> 02:27.000]  leftist controlled cities I mean all the cities are left as control all of them
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.840]  because there's one that's quasi-Republican out of 800 I mean we're
[02:30.840 --> 02:35.880]  gone they've seized control the UN's in there running and I've got that's all in
[02:35.880 --> 02:39.520]  the news today I mean we're in the new world order we've just got a few pockets
[02:39.520 --> 02:42.680]  of resistance in the government left because the American people just don't
[02:42.680 --> 02:46.560]  know how much trouble they're in but if they're gonna have massive election fraud
[02:46.560 --> 02:52.040]  and dead cats are getting their mail-in ballots and their voters were voter
[02:52.040 --> 03:00.640]  registration cards dead cats then you have to understand that that is how
[03:00.640 --> 03:05.080]  they're gonna engage in an absolute fraudulent election and the Democrats
[03:05.080 --> 03:08.680]  have said they will and Pelosi said one way or the other he's gonna be
[03:08.680 --> 03:12.240]  fumigated out of there he will be gone they're now saying they'll use the
[03:12.240 --> 03:16.880]  military on it so if Trump doesn't let them engage in fraud and criminal activity
[03:16.880 --> 03:27.720]  and he upfront fights them then they are going to say they're gonna remove him
[03:27.720 --> 03:30.680]  from office and that's why they have all the race warring going on that's the
[03:30.680 --> 03:35.280]  smoke screen for the overthrow of government and mass murder and communist
[03:35.280 --> 03:42.200]  uprising which they are now activating in just the last week and we have video
[03:42.200 --> 03:47.520]  exclusive video third hour Billy Weaver got it inside the zoom meanings of the
[03:47.520 --> 03:53.280]  Soros funded organization where now they're even activating the grassroots
[03:53.280 --> 03:59.160]  high school kids with hammers and telling him to go out and start targeting
[03:59.160 --> 04:07.800]  people that's Maoist plan you know the average age was about 12 so we're gonna
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.920]  have part three of this information today exclusive video inside their
[04:13.920 --> 04:20.440]  meetings where they are announcing basically like the golden dawn of the
[04:20.440 --> 04:26.960]  golden path communist movements they are a change their name to something
[04:26.960 --> 04:32.960]  similar to that and are just announcing absolute hell on earth you think oh this
[04:32.960 --> 04:36.520]  is ridiculous this will be pushed aside easily no this is the big mega attack
[04:36.520 --> 04:40.600]  everything else was probing so that you don't respond when they finally hit so
[04:40.600 --> 04:45.160]  they keep calling the fire bombings the shootings the stabbings peaceful because
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.000]  they're defining that as peaceful to say that to stand up against it is
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.680]  illegal they are emasculating and decapitating the security services
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.520]  ahead of the communist overthrow this is it America's fighting for its life the

[06:11.360 --> 06:16.880]  Trump has now announced a move to postpone the election to force the
[06:16.880 --> 06:21.960]  Democrats who are illegally and who are criminally with giant databases mailing
[06:21.960 --> 06:29.600]  every home in the country voter registration cards the name of dead

[06:35.000 --> 06:41.600]  happening all over the nation and it's illegal now the media plays on the
[06:41.600 --> 06:46.440]  public cigarettes and goes why Trump's got his absentee ballot that's when you're
[06:46.440 --> 06:51.040]  registered that's when you voted you've got your absentee they know who you are
[06:51.040 --> 06:56.760]  that is not sending people mail-in ballots in the mail or just dumping off
[06:56.760 --> 07:02.080]  huge stacks of them with random names on it all over your streets they're taking
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.400]  the names of the dead people they're taking the names of people who haven't
[07:05.400 --> 07:08.400]  voted for many years that are in nursing homes they're taking the names of
[07:08.400 --> 07:15.640]  illegal aliens dead cats names period and putting them on the voter rolls how
[07:15.640 --> 07:19.440]  do you think the Democrats just won Kentucky it turned out hundreds of
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.520]  thousands of people who'd never even voted in the state learned when the
[07:24.520 --> 07:29.560]  database was made public by researchers on this show that they had voted people
[07:29.560 --> 07:32.560]  who'd never lived in Kentucky people who had lived in Kentucky but hadn't lived
[07:32.560 --> 07:39.000]  there in a decade they didn't just get registered they voted for the Democrat
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.660]  even though they were Republicans Millie Weaver broke that information here on
[07:44.660 --> 07:47.920]  there should be with us in the third hour she went inside one of these
[07:47.920 --> 07:51.920]  organizations their zoom meetings one of the big Soros youth brigades for high
[07:51.920 --> 07:58.720]  school kids and they are now saying now is time for violence get hammers go out
[07:58.720 --> 08:04.440]  on the street and start attacking people you're gonna see the video now again
[08:04.440 --> 08:12.240]  they've got Trump surveilled they've got spies inside the White House they know
[08:12.240 --> 08:17.320]  what they're doing and you see Trump suddenly go okay the virus is real
[08:17.320 --> 08:21.600]  maybe we do need a lockdown maybe we do need to postpone things I said what is
[08:21.600 --> 08:29.280]  he doing there and that's so he goes okay then we'll just postpone the election
[08:29.280 --> 08:33.520]  because we're not gonna let you just mail all these out everywhere we need
[08:33.520 --> 08:39.840]  time for the courts to rule as they've been doing that you can't do this and
[08:39.840 --> 08:43.920]  that's why now they've activated their armies of Antifa and BLM that have
[08:43.920 --> 08:47.120]  already probed that have already tested they've already branded it that it's
[08:47.120 --> 08:52.960]  nonviolent to firebomb to shoot and stab people and kill people and all of that is
[08:52.960 --> 08:56.440]  just a probing test and I told you yesterday you guys give me the law
[08:56.440 --> 09:01.080]  enforcement print out I got I forgot to get that off my desk I need that that
[09:01.080 --> 09:08.400]  they are now preparing squads death squads in Austin to kill the police and
[09:08.400 --> 09:14.880]  then to go to conservative leaders homes and kill them and their families the
[09:14.880 --> 09:20.040]  city of Austin's official budget calls for blowing up the police station as a
[09:20.040 --> 09:25.400]  sign of ending hate I showed you the official budget it says we want to
[09:25.400 --> 09:31.320]  accelerate the demolition of the APD headquarters we want it closed and we
[09:31.320 --> 09:35.740]  want the police sent for reeducation inside other agencies it actually says
[09:35.740 --> 09:40.920]  we want them sent for education they call it reconstruct and deconstruct
[09:40.920 --> 09:46.280]  that's what communists do when they take over so this has been being planned for a
[09:46.280 --> 10:02.280]  long long long time this has been planned for a long long long time now if
[10:02.280 --> 10:05.640]  you're tuning in that's not satire when I said they want to blow up the police
[10:05.640 --> 10:11.000]  station it's not satire when they charge the feds $500 every 15 minutes in
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.920]  Portland because they have a fence up around the building to stop people
[10:13.920 --> 10:18.800]  firebombing it it's not satire that federal and state judges have ordered
[10:18.800 --> 10:24.840]  the feds to not defend themselves and to let the building be burned down now I
[10:24.840 --> 10:28.600]  have video of this being prepared we're gonna premiere in the third hour I have
[10:28.600 --> 10:33.000]  federal state and local law enforcement sources but I've already been targeted by
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.160]  this Tucker Carlson has been targeted the leader of the Senate's been targeted
[10:37.160 --> 10:42.720]  and when he complained about it Twitter suspended Mitch McConnell's account the
[10:42.720 --> 10:47.120]  president's now being blocked by Twitter his son was suspended for showing a
[10:47.120 --> 10:52.760]  press conference of medical doctors one near its Alex Jones two years later it's
[10:52.760 --> 11:00.320]  medical doctors just spoke with APD source and then this is dead on inside
[11:00.320 --> 11:05.360]  Monday evening BLM and other anti-police group members were riding
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.920]  around downtown Austin in technicals pickup trucks with two to four armed
[11:10.920 --> 11:16.400]  individuals with rifles in the back stopping cars that's policing area this
[11:16.400 --> 11:20.760]  is a Soviet communist I'll take over counter-flowing going the wrong way on
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.880]  streets etc APD reported on what was happening and wanted to interfere but
[11:25.880 --> 11:30.280]  were told to stand down unless they started shooting these trucks were
[11:30.280 --> 11:34.880]  stopping in the middle of the road intimidating other motors etc rank and
[11:34.880 --> 11:39.280]  fall cops were furious they weren't allowed to act also same guy who was
[11:39.280 --> 11:44.280]  shot and killed attacking the vehicle had been in several other protests down
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.000]  in front of APD headquarters with his AK and had stopped vehicles in the roadway
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.520]  on front it's road APD cops reported that he was doing that again and were
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.680]  told to stand down well since when is a citizen or anybody or the police have to
[11:58.680 --> 12:01.920]  stand down if you see a crime being committed that that's a crime sources
[12:01.920 --> 12:08.240]  say that activity may very well have been captured on the HQ cameras they're
[12:08.240 --> 12:13.640]  also received intel briefed at Antifa and related groups are planning for a
[12:13.640 --> 12:20.360]  takeover of part of Austin like chop chas in Seattle that could happen as early
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.680]  as this weekend they are calling for additional manpower the APD to be ready
[12:24.680 --> 12:28.800]  but no word so far if the PD will be allowed to act to prevent the takeover
[12:28.800 --> 12:35.360]  just like in all the other cities and then you won't see the governor if the
[12:35.360 --> 12:38.520]  governor will not talk to any of the Republican leaders anymore he won't talk
[12:38.520 --> 12:44.920]  to the lieutenant governor he won't talk to anyone he goes and locks himself in
[12:44.920 --> 12:50.160]  a room and gets orders from the CDC and Fauci who again is running the globalist
[12:50.160 --> 12:54.040]  coup Fauci's not a doctor he's a 45-year criminal in the government running the
[12:54.040 --> 12:57.640]  criminal vaccine operation he helped get vaccine liability for the vaccine
[12:57.640 --> 13:01.800]  companies he's a eugenicist and he's involved in all these dangerous drugs
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.280]  that don't help you with COVID-19 it tries to block drugs that do help you he
[13:05.280 --> 13:09.440]  is a master criminal everything he said has been a total lie but then he says
[13:09.440 --> 13:12.240]  medical doctors should not be allowed to have press conferences it's actually
[13:12.240 --> 13:16.880]  on screen folks you on MSNBC and said that medical doctors should not be
[13:16.880 --> 13:20.320]  allowed to have press conferences he said it was good that they were banned and
[13:20.320 --> 13:23.360]  that they don't know what they're talking about the guy that told you 2.5
[13:23.360 --> 13:33.600]  million will be dead by now it's not even 150,000 so this is it Trump has to say
[13:33.600 --> 13:37.760]  we're going to move back the election you've set everything else down if you
[13:37.760 --> 13:41.360]  don't stop the mail-in ballots they have to be declared fraudulent you cannot
[13:41.360 --> 13:47.080]  allow fraudulent made-up mail-in ballots that aren't even absentee ballots that
[13:47.080 --> 13:51.400]  are fake you have to have time to be able to go over the results and throw out
[13:51.400 --> 13:55.880]  what isn't good and they're saying if he even challenges any of this even though
[13:55.880 --> 13:59.720]  massive frauds coming out everywhere there's newscast about thousands of
[13:59.720 --> 14:03.640]  ballots stacked up at people's mailboxes but with random names on them all over
[14:03.640 --> 14:10.120]  the country Florida Texas California Michigan Pennsylvania it's happening
[14:10.120 --> 14:17.160]  everywhere a fraudulent criminal takeover and so when he does this they're
[14:17.160 --> 14:20.600]  gonna say he's a terrorist they're gonna say he's the bad guy does anybody
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.400]  realize the maximum alert they're making their move they're making their move
[14:26.400 --> 14:33.680]  they have armed communist methods driving around in pickup trucks pointing
[14:33.680 --> 14:37.920]  guns at people and shutting roads down and practicing taking control of the
[14:37.920 --> 14:43.240]  city and when they kill people the news covers it up when they shoot people in
[14:43.240 --> 14:47.880]  the head it doesn't even make the news most of time 20 plus cops have been
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.600]  killed the last few months you know their names do you executed this is it
[14:52.600 --> 14:58.320]  because we're soft we're compliant we let convicted pedophiles come and have
[14:58.320 --> 15:01.560]  time with your elementary school children bounce little boys and girls on
[15:01.560 --> 15:08.760]  their you know on their swollen crotches and we put up with it so now
[15:08.760 --> 15:12.720]  they're announcing in England do not fly the British flag do not fly the King
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.480]  George flag Finland and others are being told don't fly your flags they're now
[15:17.480 --> 15:22.520]  said they're getting rid of national team names nations existing as bad this is
[15:22.520 --> 15:28.720]  a globalist takeover this is it you know like well these are pathetic people the
[15:28.720 --> 15:32.160]  meth head anti-photypes are the lowest level they've got professors and
[15:32.160 --> 15:37.280]  operatives politicos above them and then they've got MS-13 chai-com teams and
[15:37.280 --> 15:40.840]  other groups ready to carry out real operations and they're going to stage
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.480]  massive terror attacks and blame patriots during all of this and then call it a
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.560]  race war a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go
[15:49.560 --> 15:54.360]  back to those shows we laid out the AI takeover plan the tracking of cell
[15:54.360 --> 16:00.480]  phones how programmed master computers would manipulate control society how
[16:00.480 --> 16:04.560]  they'd be able to not just predict large groups of human movements and
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.040]  activities but even predict what individuals would do and then once you
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.560]  could predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli
[16:11.560 --> 16:16.640]  through the AI systems through the computers through digital billboards
[16:16.640 --> 16:20.640]  through face scanning through the social credit score to control people and
[16:20.640 --> 16:24.720]  make them act like you wanted to but when we cover that the media would attack
[16:24.720 --> 16:28.860]  us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in
[16:28.860 --> 16:32.760]  the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of the
[16:32.760 --> 16:36.640]  blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.760]  system to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.120]  thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned so we might want to
[16:44.120 --> 16:49.800]  dismantle the system now there are only a few days left to take advantage of the
[16:49.800 --> 16:57.000]  biggest info war sale of 2020 so far it is Christmas in July and July ends this

[18:04.560 --> 18:10.280]  multinational corporations above the law robber barons crony capitalist
[18:10.280 --> 18:16.240]  post-humanist globalist are launching a communist overthrow of the United
[18:16.240 --> 18:20.000]  States they're gonna launch it whether Trump gets reelected or not whether
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.680]  Trump postpones the election because of election fraud or not it's it's
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.240]  happening they're not gonna stop now they are actually activating people ages
[18:29.240 --> 18:36.200]  12 up into adulthood with hammers with guns with weapons with mall off cocktails
[18:36.200 --> 18:39.400]  they're gonna burn down the police stations they're gonna attack the
[18:39.400 --> 18:44.560]  military bases in an agile prop and if the military responds they're gonna be
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.720]  called terrorists and you're gonna have Congress come out and condemn our
[18:48.720 --> 18:53.280]  military and our police and say it's wrong and if they don't respond they'll
[18:53.280 --> 18:57.280]  just take over now and explain something if you tuned in a long time ago you
[18:57.280 --> 19:04.040]  noticed I said they're planning a malice youth brigade civil war backed up by
[19:04.040 --> 19:08.320]  real technicians that'll actually assassinate people but with the power
[19:08.320 --> 19:11.680]  plants getting blown up and highways shut down the rest of it you'll you'll
[19:11.680 --> 19:15.520]  hear oh this talk show has got killed or this senator's house got blown up its
[19:15.520 --> 19:19.040]  wife and kids are dead and they'll say oh Patriot militia did it I mean it's
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.360]  it's gonna go to a level you've never before seen they're gonna say that
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.960]  Patriots have killed black leaders to again enrage everything while the
[19:28.960 --> 19:33.880]  globalists are killing the police and burning everything down that's why they
[19:33.880 --> 19:37.440]  feared info war so much because I understand the globalist I understand
[19:37.440 --> 19:40.360]  how they operate I see what they've done in other countries we know how to stop
[19:40.360 --> 19:46.560]  them but if you're naive about this and if people don't get very very serious
[19:46.560 --> 19:54.680]  about this we're going to lose everything and they are gonna shut this
[19:54.680 --> 19:58.720]  country down and bring in a decade-long depression until the globalists own
[19:58.720 --> 20:04.200]  every piece of land every house everything and a lot of people are gonna
[20:04.200 --> 20:07.440]  give them the money give them the property a lot of men are gonna line up
[20:07.440 --> 20:11.920]  and bow down as collaborators they're gonna say everything will be peaceful
[20:11.920 --> 20:16.560]  just come in and swear your allegiance to the new sunrise movement you know the
[20:16.560 --> 20:23.040]  new golden path and as soon as the people capitulate in the small towns and
[20:23.040 --> 20:27.760]  the medium-sized cities and as soon as the farmers capitulate it's over we're
[20:27.760 --> 20:32.280]  done will be just like the Russians 1917 it'll take them a year or two to
[20:32.280 --> 20:38.400]  consolidate power you're going to have to go to war folks and we've really tried
[20:38.400 --> 20:43.800]  to not get to this point I don't want any offensive attacks but you understand
[20:43.800 --> 20:47.600]  that when they if they're able to collapse the country kill the president
[20:47.600 --> 20:54.240]  and kill the resistance leadership you are absolutely empowered by the
[20:54.240 --> 20:58.920]  Constitution Declaration of Independence and God in common sense to understand
[20:58.920 --> 21:03.240]  what you're up against I know you're not gonna submit to these people but
[21:03.240 --> 21:11.320]  remember wiping out their low-level minions is not the main target it is
[21:11.320 --> 21:16.240]  essential that if they start this physical war and they're killing us it's
[21:16.240 --> 21:19.880]  essential that you go after their leadership and again ladies and gentlemen
[21:19.880 --> 21:23.120]  that means a lot of you that are businessmen a lot of you that are former
[21:23.120 --> 21:26.600]  military and very serious people you might be 70 years old you're gonna have
[21:26.600 --> 21:30.680]  to get on that airplane and you're gonna have to go find these people on your
[21:30.680 --> 21:35.840]  mission and you are totally expendable gut up and stop being a coward and get
[21:35.840 --> 21:40.000]  out there and get the job done now we've gone so far down this rat hole now
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.080]  we're facing a communist uprising the total destruction of the country that
[21:43.080 --> 21:46.840]  I'm now having to get on air and just start going to the doomsday switches here
[21:46.840 --> 21:50.840]  ladies and gentlemen but everybody already knows what to do we've tried we've
[21:50.840 --> 21:55.200]  worked hard and we are not flat-footed there's a really good chance we're gonna
[21:55.200 --> 21:59.080]  wipe all these people out politically but they're gonna burn things and shoot
[21:59.080 --> 22:05.000]  people and start murdering because they're followers it's the globalist in
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.040]  Europe it's the powerful chai comms it's the old rich families that feel
[22:09.040 --> 22:12.960]  insulated from this that believe they can have a civil war to finally bring
[22:12.960 --> 22:18.600]  down America and then China takes over the world politically and culturally but
[22:18.600 --> 22:23.040]  I just want to tell the Pentagon and the CIA and all you lawyers and people that
[22:23.040 --> 22:29.120]  have been sitting on the sidelines while this happened and allowing this to get
[22:29.120 --> 22:34.560]  to this point you're your own worst enemies that you'd let a horrible dirty
[22:34.560 --> 22:39.040]  new world order technocracy communist system take over this country and you
[22:39.040 --> 22:41.960]  would allow the things that have been done to this nation and the destruction
[22:41.960 --> 22:45.760]  of our morals and the collapse of our civilization you are idiots you have
[22:45.760 --> 22:50.280]  taken everything we built and flushed it down the toilet because you were
[22:50.280 --> 22:54.840]  followers and you were cowards and by successive approximation you gave in to
[22:54.840 --> 22:59.480]  these people and you bowed to them and then they saw the police all bow to the
[22:59.480 --> 23:03.960]  George Soros communist anti-fund BLM and and and they've seen you on your
[23:03.960 --> 23:09.600]  knees and so now they know they're gonna collapse the borders with the third
[23:09.600 --> 23:15.360]  world they are gonna absolutely destroy everything and so you remember all you
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.400]  middle-class and wealthy people when you've got nothing and you're disarmed
[23:20.400 --> 23:25.000]  and that you're wishing later you've done something you can do something at that
[23:25.000 --> 23:29.600]  point no more excuses
[23:31.440 --> 23:36.760]  nobody stood up for the 62 million babies did they nobody stood up when they
[23:36.760 --> 23:40.040]  had in tens of millions brain damage from the vaccines I mean people did stand
[23:40.040 --> 23:45.080]  up it but most of us didn't and so now the wolves have come because we're known
[23:45.080 --> 23:51.040]  as chumps we're known as stupid you think the globalists just sent people
[23:51.040 --> 23:54.880]  with pneumonia and flu and the nursing homes by accident they wanted high death
[23:54.880 --> 23:57.880]  numbers they wanted to see if they could get away with it and they did you pass
[23:57.880 --> 24:02.240]  that test to America you let them give you fake COVID numbers and pay a 2.5
[24:02.240 --> 24:06.960]  million would be dead and and everybody keeps submitting so they look at all
[24:06.960 --> 24:10.320]  those sheep out there and they say good we're gonna make our move but here's
[24:10.320 --> 24:15.880]  where the globalist made the big mistake here's where the new world order made the
[24:15.880 --> 24:22.280]  big mistake it's never a majority that defeats tyrants it's always a tiny
[24:22.280 --> 24:27.600]  minority of people and I'm here to tell you 3% started and won the war against
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.200]  the British who were angels compared to these new world order people
[24:32.200 --> 24:44.640]  and we've got we've got close to 10% and we've got women who understand that
[24:44.640 --> 24:48.760]  when men cease to be men women have to pick up that role and I predict it's
[24:48.760 --> 24:52.160]  gonna be women that are gonna be stacking dead bodies of these new order
[24:52.160 --> 24:55.120]  people up as high as you can stack them I'm gonna tell you global something
[24:55.120 --> 25:04.400]  you're dead and you know it so you keep pushing you're gonna get everything you
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.800]  want because nobody needs guns to win this war we can beat these people with
[25:09.800 --> 25:13.640]  our bare hands ladies and gentlemen when they go to restaurants and when they go
[25:13.640 --> 25:17.040]  to sleep at night when they go for a walk they're the ones that are gonna be
[25:17.040 --> 25:21.760]  hunted long after I'm gone and shoveled in my grave you need to understand that
[25:21.760 --> 25:25.600]  ladies and gentlemen that that's when the real fight starts I hope we don't
[25:25.600 --> 25:29.080]  have to go down this path but I'm having to now get up here and tell you I
[25:29.080 --> 25:34.280]  think you already all know it anyways don't you where we are but I'll tell
[25:34.280 --> 25:37.440]  you this it's good knowing all of you all the great stations the sponsors the
[25:37.440 --> 25:40.920]  listeners all of us a family black white old young all this together just wanting
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.360]  justice and freedom up against these slimy murder and pedophile devil
[25:44.360 --> 25:47.800]  worshipers and it's sad to see how soft our countrymen have become but that's
[25:47.800 --> 25:52.120]  okay because we're going under judgment just like the Bible says and it's a
[25:52.120 --> 25:55.240]  history book it mirrors the Roman histories and the rest of them that
[25:55.240 --> 25:57.880]  every time Israel became decadent and evil they got judged and went into
[25:57.880 --> 26:02.520]  captivity but then they became righteous again that's the way it is with
[26:02.520 --> 26:07.640]  every culture and so this is here to test the righteous this is here to test
[26:07.640 --> 26:12.840]  who we are and you know we're men we're women we're strong we're alive we're not
[26:12.840 --> 26:15.920]  those little babies getting chopped up inside their mommies and nobody stood
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.840]  up for them so now we we get to fight so we didn't fight when we had a chance
[26:21.840 --> 26:24.240]  to really turn this around did we so like Churchill said they'll come at
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.320]  time when you got a fight when there's no chance of winning but it's better to
[26:28.320 --> 26:32.280]  dial on your feet than on your knees as a slave we still have a big chance to win
[26:32.280 --> 26:37.640]  folks but we're we're entering that area where where where it's gonna mean
[26:37.640 --> 26:41.640]  physical conflict just remember high value targets ladies and gentlemen I

[28:43.120 --> 28:48.240]  the reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one
[28:48.240 --> 28:53.680]  reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes
[28:53.680 --> 28:59.320]  many times here on air the casual society the surveillance system global
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.880]  government medical tyranny forced inoculation the most important facet
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.560]  is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to
[29:10.560 --> 29:16.600]  witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[29:16.600 --> 29:22.880]  by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's
[29:22.880 --> 29:28.440]  been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through
[29:28.440 --> 29:33.800]  governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that
[29:33.800 --> 29:39.000]  control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.840]  power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[29:44.840 --> 30:05.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:05.840 --> 30:13.040]  I want to be completely clear about this no offensive violence but once they
[30:13.040 --> 30:18.160]  start a physical war and they're crossing that threshold very soon going out
[30:18.160 --> 30:23.320]  and finding the people in command of these operations is not offensive it is
[30:23.320 --> 30:35.280]  defensive the best defense is offense once you enter a war and notice what the
[30:35.280 --> 30:39.160]  globalist are attacking federal buildings courthouses the police the
[30:39.160 --> 30:44.360]  lowest level of the government where there's still rule of law to some extent
[30:44.360 --> 30:49.080]  they want to wipe that out to become it and they want to intimidate through the
[30:49.080 --> 30:53.600]  UN strong cities initiative that was set up by Obama and Loretta Lynch to have
[30:53.600 --> 30:58.800]  the police then under a political overthrow of Trump bowed to them and
[30:58.800 --> 31:03.120]  submit to their list of demands then they will come out they've already said
[31:03.120 --> 31:08.800]  this in purge any loyal Americans off the force and will quickly then replace
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.000]  them with the worst types of political operatives you could imagine and they
[31:13.000 --> 31:15.960]  will be coming to your home and they'll have the cover of contact tracing
[31:15.960 --> 31:20.480]  run by the Clinton Foundation and and other things Obama's plan for a
[31:20.480 --> 31:28.880]  domestic military just as big just as strong as the US military and you've
[31:28.880 --> 31:34.080]  seen the brutish hateful horrible behavior of these people all over the
[31:34.080 --> 31:38.080]  country they're now in Austin driving around in cars blocking traffic pointing
[31:38.080 --> 31:42.760]  guns at families jumping on all ladies cars and the police sit there in her
[31:42.760 --> 31:47.800]  order to stand down well you shouldn't be standing down if you got fired for
[31:47.800 --> 31:54.600]  that the people would stand up for you but we do have a criminal mayor so they
[31:54.600 --> 32:00.800]  now are going to install for an illegal third term because it's the same move
[32:00.800 --> 32:05.360]  everywhere and Soros has put his mayors and his prosecutors in almost every
[32:05.360 --> 32:10.960]  city the Chicago Tribune did a big story on it they're calling for the famous
[32:10.960 --> 32:14.920]  investigative journalist to be fired because he said Soros is financing
[32:14.920 --> 32:21.560]  lawlessness it's true he said screw you fire me if you want John cost defies
[32:21.560 --> 32:25.360]  Chicago Tribune cancelled culture I will not apologize for writing about
[32:25.360 --> 32:38.560]  Soros who do they prosecute shop owners that shoot back in New York in St. Louis
[32:38.560 --> 32:45.440]  in Chicago in San Francisco they're arresting people that shoot back they're
[32:45.440 --> 32:49.200]  arresting people that defend their doorstep from a mob of people saying
[32:49.200 --> 32:56.920]  we're going to kill you because you're white so all I'm telling you is they
[32:56.920 --> 33:05.320]  are planning it's already here a hot communist take-up and all you would
[33:05.320 --> 33:08.680]  laugh all those little dumb commies and anti for the cops will deal with them
[33:08.680 --> 33:12.400]  really when their commanders are the ones running it when the mayors are the
[33:12.400 --> 33:16.280]  ones running it you think that mayor in Portland got upset when he came out and
[33:16.280 --> 33:20.400]  praised them and so they were nonviolent and then they started attacking him you
[33:20.400 --> 33:25.600]  think he got up snow he liked that that shows his minions are so evil and so
[33:25.600 --> 33:30.320]  stupid that they saw an old white man and the government and they attacked it
[33:30.320 --> 33:35.880]  because they want to be that government their attack dogs are so mindless they've
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.320]  been fed so much spiritual gunpowder that they're biting their own handlers
[33:41.320 --> 33:46.320]  they like seeing their armies of scum swell out of control and be totally
[33:46.320 --> 33:58.200]  mindless they'll be set up and they'll be flushed down the toilet later they are
[33:58.200 --> 34:03.760]  emboldening them the communist did this they encourage the mobs in China to go
[34:03.760 --> 34:08.600]  after their own communist officials like gg pink's father who came out and
[34:08.600 --> 34:16.120]  praised them but that wasn't enough this is a forum you lay to take all the low
[34:16.120 --> 34:21.840]  IQ people and embroil them and hype them up into a crazed mode and then to have
[34:21.840 --> 34:28.040]  them burn down homeless camps and blame us have them attack our vehicle with
[34:28.040 --> 34:33.680]  hammers and then the news said we staged it because the antifa is pure the
[34:33.680 --> 34:39.800]  antifa is good George Soros doesn't fund them the New York Times says and then he
[34:39.800 --> 34:44.360]  comes out in an op-ed bragging how he does you go that's an attack on logic
[34:44.360 --> 34:51.400]  they don't respect you they lie to you on purpose and then change the story don't
[34:51.400 --> 34:57.080]  wear a mask do wear a mask 2.5 million are gonna be dead is it true oh we can't
[34:57.080 --> 34:59.520]  hear from other doctors they're not allowed to have a press conference
[34:59.520 --> 35:04.680]  Fauci comes and says I we have the video I agree they should be taken off the
[35:04.680 --> 35:09.440]  air those 15 medical doctors some of them with prestigious resumes they're not
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.920]  allowed to talk about treatments that are working 100% because we're giving you a
[35:13.920 --> 35:22.080]  problem that never ends we got you under martial law in your house we got
[35:22.080 --> 35:31.400]  everybody wearing these masks and we're exercising our lives over you period
[35:36.360 --> 35:41.960]  it's about the exercise of power it's a cult it's a cult of psychiatrists and
[35:41.960 --> 35:45.960]  psychologists and a bunch of pedophiles and occultists who are into power and
[35:45.960 --> 35:49.080]  who don't respect you because they know you're watching TV and they've dumbed
[35:49.080 --> 35:53.880]  you down and now they're testing to see what they can get away with and the
[35:53.880 --> 35:58.560]  president of the United States has come out and made the perfect move hey if you
[35:58.560 --> 36:02.600]  keep sitting in illegal mail-in ballots with the names of dead cats and dead
[36:02.600 --> 36:05.640]  dogs and dead people on it and illegal aliens are getting it and
[36:05.640 --> 36:08.840]  Republicans are getting their mail-in ballots that say they're Democrat it's
[36:08.840 --> 36:14.160]  all the same from Kentucky to California to Michigan they're all people are
[36:14.160 --> 36:20.080]  getting mail-in ballot it says they're a Democrat on it or they're cats getting
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.120]  one they're dead cat because it's names they're scooping up every name and every
[36:27.120 --> 36:30.560]  address and they're mailing it out so people send them in so they can pick
[36:30.560 --> 36:34.360]  and choose what they want so they can stuff the ballot box and it's what
[36:34.360 --> 36:39.040]  they're doing and so they've been surveilling Trump and that's why suddenly
[36:39.040 --> 36:41.760]  two weeks ago he's not gonna leave he's not gonna leave he's the challenge
[36:41.760 --> 36:44.760]  the election he's a dictator we're overthrow him because they're gonna
[36:44.760 --> 36:48.440]  challenge the election one way or the other and so Trump's doing the right
[36:48.440 --> 36:51.360]  thing saying uh-uh you're not gonna do that till we have time to have judges
[36:51.360 --> 36:54.840]  overturn this you're not gonna have what violates federal law and have these
[36:54.840 --> 37:00.160]  fake ballots that's the move and then they're gonna launch their revolution
[37:00.160 --> 37:04.680]  they were gonna launch regardless and they plan to put us into martial law
[37:04.680 --> 37:08.200]  which they already have with the COVID and so Trump says okay I'll be your
[37:08.200 --> 37:16.520]  huckleberry I'll give you what you want and he's trying to get them to move
[37:16.520 --> 37:25.320]  early it's a very good move and that's why I told you it's all about him not
[37:25.320 --> 37:28.080]  leaving office it's all about the election it's all about suspension of
[37:28.080 --> 37:32.400]  it and then saying he's gonna do it he's gonna do it because he has to he has to
[37:32.400 --> 37:36.320]  make them come out and say we're gonna do mail-in ballots that aren't absentee
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.480]  that are fraudulent he's got to force that out in the open to show the fraud
[37:41.480 --> 37:46.520]  beforehand not try to fight the fraud the day of the election he's got to defeat
[37:46.520 --> 37:51.200]  the fraud now or they're gonna steal it like Pelosi said he's gone we don't care
[37:51.200 --> 37:55.680]  period they've got their plan and then when he's gone they're not gonna stop the
[37:55.680 --> 37:59.320]  contact tracing it's all beneficially set up governor of Texas paid billions to
[37:59.320 --> 38:02.640]  Google to run it the Clinton Foundation is training the people right now the

[38:31.040 --> 38:34.280]  weeks ago I said we've hired a very well-known statistician we're gonna say
[38:34.280 --> 38:39.280]  his name is he'll be he'll be targeted he's also an academic to go and say you
[38:39.280 --> 38:43.200]  know we don't want to do the numbers ourselves look at a national in Texas we
[38:43.200 --> 38:45.840]  see these graphs showing they're taking the regular flu deaths and other deaths
[38:45.840 --> 38:51.520]  and putting it in the COVID column he did the numbers there in stories getting
[38:51.520 --> 38:56.320]  written about by Don Salazar infowars.com where they absolutely end the
[38:56.320 --> 39:00.200]  flu and other deaths and then just add it to the COVID and the graphs follow
[39:00.200 --> 39:10.280]  each other exactly that's done by a major statistician using CDC's own numbers so
[39:10.280 --> 39:15.160]  that's coming up I mean this is organized criminal takeover mechanized
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.760]  Trump never got control the propaganda arms the operation mockingbird systems
[39:19.760 --> 39:25.240]  that are in place and we just I mean the company I'm not even afraid I don't

[43:06.080 --> 43:10.640]  so easy and so cool and so fun the Microsoft website now officially has
[43:10.640 --> 43:15.040]  announced the digital tattoo we exposed this six months ago Bill Gates was
[43:15.040 --> 43:18.320]  funding it they had hundreds of news articles attacking and saying it wasn't
[43:18.320 --> 43:22.600]  true this is a tactic they use first they announce it we say it's a bad idea
[43:22.600 --> 43:26.280]  they say that's crazy we didn't do it they introduced the idea to you then
[43:26.280 --> 43:30.040]  they come back and announce it again thinking you have no memory this is a
[43:30.040 --> 43:36.000]  criminal takeover this is the line in the sand we must say no we must expose
[43:36.000 --> 43:41.240]  the fraud of COVID-19 this entire house of evil is built on I'm Alex Jones never
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.240]  surrendered a tyranny in FullWars.com
[43:45.240 --> 44:01.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.480]  every morning at the mine you can see him arrive he stood six foot six and
[44:05.480 --> 44:10.680]  waited 245 kind of brawl at his shoulder and narrowed the hip and everybody knew
[44:10.680 --> 44:26.560]  you didn't give no lift to Big John Big John Big John Big Bad John Big John nobody
[44:26.560 --> 44:30.960]  seemed to know where John called home he just drifted in the town and stayed all
[44:30.960 --> 44:35.880]  alone he didn't say much he kind of quiet and shy and if you spoke at all you
[44:35.880 --> 44:43.240]  just said hi to Big John somebody said he came from New Orleans where he got in
[44:43.240 --> 44:48.360]  a fight or a Cajun Queen and a crash and blow from a huge right-hands and a
[44:48.360 --> 44:52.320]  Louisiana fella to the promised land Big John
[44:52.320 --> 45:00.960]  Big John welcome back I don't have any way to raise the alarm Big Bad John as
[45:00.960 --> 45:08.120]  high as it needs to be we are in a lot of trouble we are this country's dying of
[45:08.120 --> 45:14.080]  spiritual cultural cancer and there's still a lot of good people but folks
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.320]  just are naive and they're also kind of punched drunk to put it up with
[45:18.320 --> 45:23.440]  corruption and the new world order is sampling and studying people with
[45:23.440 --> 45:28.840]  psychological psychological systems to see how much we'll put up with and how
[45:28.840 --> 45:35.240]  much their people will do how much will we submit to and and how evil and
[45:35.240 --> 45:41.040]  corrupt will their minions be and we've been passing the test submitting and not
[45:41.040 --> 45:45.280]  getting involved not you the audience of great activists but the general public
[45:45.280 --> 45:53.960]  we've really passed in flying colors going along with all this and the left
[45:53.960 --> 45:59.360]  has passed in flying colors to basically have adopted Satanism as their operating
[45:59.360 --> 46:02.760]  system I mean you go to a Democrat event I don't care if it's rich old lady
[46:02.760 --> 46:07.240]  event or a regular one on the streets I mean these are weird mentally ill sick
[46:07.240 --> 46:12.080]  people that have really gotten into degeneracy and corruption because their
[46:12.080 --> 46:17.200]  leaders are so bad and so you see it is weak that Joe Biden has to be held by
[46:17.200 --> 46:20.920]  the hand now when he walks around outside obviously doesn't have good
[46:20.920 --> 46:28.600]  balance is drugged out of his mind and the whole me to movement claiming you
[46:28.600 --> 46:32.080]  know that all men are rapist and it just to destroy the relationship of men and
[46:32.080 --> 46:35.960]  women all of this is an attack on the species like aliens run basically much
[46:35.960 --> 46:42.720]  thing they do I'm just saying it might as well be and so you see the weakness of
[46:42.720 --> 46:47.440]  their minions and the weakness of their candidates that's their strength that
[46:47.440 --> 46:52.600]  something so pathetic and so ridiculous and so out of its mind and so
[46:52.600 --> 47:00.360]  fraudulent could be what's defeating us you realize how much sweeter that is to
[47:00.360 --> 47:02.560]  them
[47:05.640 --> 47:12.400]  no this is satanically inspired this whole thing's got Satan written all
[47:12.400 --> 47:20.640]  over it that's who signed the painting and things are about to get hellish I
[47:20.640 --> 47:24.720]  mean the global depressions here millions are starving to death the very UN
[47:24.720 --> 47:27.680]  running the operation and gets more contributions off the millions they're
[47:27.680 --> 47:33.160]  killing you see people wearing the mask and now Fauci says we're goggles it's
[47:33.160 --> 47:37.360]  always more and more and gloves that do nothing and people fetishize it and get
[47:37.360 --> 47:41.480]  in your face if you're not doing it you know you see these signs no mask no
[47:41.480 --> 47:49.760]  service no vaccines no service no medical ID no service and now your
[47:49.760 --> 47:53.320]  medical records are all public and you have no rights boom it's a medical
[47:53.320 --> 48:01.040]  tyranny it was always going to come at us from that angle Roger Stone is gonna
[48:01.040 --> 48:08.120]  look at the election and Trump's response to the mail-in fraud he's gonna
[48:08.120 --> 48:12.240]  be looking at the election with us and discussing whether Trump should move and
[48:12.240 --> 48:15.640]  how that would be done to postpone the election until the fraud is stopped
[48:15.640 --> 48:19.680]  Trump has to do it he can't just walk into the machine gunfire and not have a
[48:19.680 --> 48:23.920]  big confrontation with them when they're lawlessly doing this for those of you
[48:23.920 --> 48:26.240]  that just joined us Trump tweeted out today that that's indeed where they're
[48:26.240 --> 48:30.440]  going and we'll also get the latest on the political persecution of stone
[48:30.440 --> 48:39.960]  because it's a roadmap of how they intend to persecute us all but I have
[48:39.960 --> 48:44.680]  here four stacks of news that I spent hours last night today going over
[48:44.680 --> 48:49.440]  preparing to cover after Roger leaves us I'm gonna get into it there is a
[48:49.440 --> 48:56.160]  particular story but again it normally would be our top story but things are so
[48:56.160 --> 49:02.880]  out of control that I haven't even gotten to it yet did you know the New York
[49:02.880 --> 49:13.640]  Times 13 years ago had a big story was a big scandal about these rapid speed
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.040]  test for the cold and flu and how 90 plus percent of them are false positives
[49:19.040 --> 49:24.000]  well it's the same type test they're doing now and again let that sink in
[49:24.000 --> 49:30.000]  because the headline the New York Times was the pandemic that wasn't and the
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.080]  articles linked up on info wars commons new article about it but that's all
[49:34.080 --> 49:38.080]  they've done they've just engineered a fraud they control the UN they control
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.720]  the major health departments the robber baron money through gauge paid for it
[49:42.720 --> 49:48.520]  and they do this and they lock us down but they say oh you can go to the dead
[49:48.520 --> 49:53.240]  congressman's funeral you can line up representative John Lewis but when
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.760]  Trump has a rally you know it's the worst thing ever and it probably killed
[49:57.760 --> 50:03.160]  Herman Cain because he went to it no Herman Cain had had liver cancer he'd
[50:03.160 --> 50:11.320]  had colon cancer and I know people that knew him he's a good guy he had super
[50:11.320 --> 50:16.160]  health problems the last few years and lung problems but oh you know a papaya
[50:16.160 --> 50:20.440]  a goat you name it come up positive they got him they stuck a tube down his
[50:20.440 --> 50:25.360]  throat and they tortured him on a ventilator for a month because with
[50:25.360 --> 50:29.120]  coveted destroys your lungs you're having an autoimmune response even if you had
[50:29.120 --> 50:33.560]  it and then that destroys your lungs and they tortured him to death and now the
[50:33.560 --> 50:38.640]  headlines are he was healthy and he died of coveted 74 oh really a bunch of
[50:38.640 --> 50:45.560]  different types of cancer chemotherapy for years radiation Herman Cain was a
[50:45.560 --> 50:51.200]  strong man but if you look at the last videos of him at speeches he gave and
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.480]  things he's shaking he's having trouble up there his brains there his
[50:55.480 --> 51:00.040]  personalities there but the body is failing him the spirit is willing but
[51:00.040 --> 51:06.480]  the flesh is weak all fraud but again oh nine hundred thousand dead yet with
[51:06.480 --> 51:13.000]  fake numbers but oh we better lock the country down Herman Cain died I got a
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.800]  video where I break this down I asked the question was Herman Cain killed by a
[51:16.800 --> 51:21.960]  ventilator well according to the articles I have from Reuters they admit
[51:21.960 --> 51:25.480]  that I kept saying 70% of people that died from ventilators I'm sorry it's
[51:25.480 --> 51:30.440]  88% on the average and they were intubated when the doctors now admit
[51:30.440 --> 51:34.800]  you shouldn't do it but a lot of hospitals still follow the WHO why these

[52:07.360 --> 52:10.080]  only movie can't make there's gonna be fireworks here but he's got to get this
[52:10.080 --> 52:14.080]  out from center of their election fraud now they're branding their overthrow as
[52:14.080 --> 52:17.760]  as racial that if that's just a cover story it's a bunch of white leftist
[52:17.760 --> 52:21.440]  mainly communists that when got their two or three degrees were promised total

[55:51.520 --> 55:55.080]  when you study how they actually what you'd evolve you believe in that it is

[56:03.920 --> 56:09.520]  like COVID-19 to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose over its
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.640]  breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations for the GMO
[56:14.640 --> 56:19.440]  for the 5g and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity as we
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.080]  know it that's why this is so evil their whole agenda for cashless society
[56:24.080 --> 56:29.560]  global government you in control getting us all into debt getting rid of local
[56:29.560 --> 56:32.960]  government think about all the fast and some of the censorship the
[56:32.960 --> 56:54.800]  surveillance you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:54.800 --> 57:00.080]  in his written testimony made the claim that facebook is an american company
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.880]  with american values do any of the rest of you take a different view that is to
[57:04.880 --> 57:10.360]  say that your companies don't embrace american values it's great to see that
[57:10.360 --> 57:15.400]  none of you do mr. bachai i'm worried about google's market power how it
[57:15.400 --> 57:19.360]  concentrates that power and then ultimately how it wields it project
[57:19.360 --> 57:24.360]  may then was a collaboration between google and the department of defense that
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.640]  google pulled out of citing ethical concerns and you made the decision to
[57:28.640 --> 57:32.800]  pull out of that joint venture following receipt of a letter from thousands of
[57:32.800 --> 57:36.480]  your employees saying that google should not be in the business of war my
[57:36.480 --> 57:42.040]  question mr. bachai is did you weigh the input from your employees when making
[57:42.040 --> 57:47.520]  the decision to abandon that project with the united states military congressman
[57:47.520 --> 57:51.440]  thanks for your concern as i said earlier we're deeply committed to
[57:51.440 --> 57:55.440]  supporting the military and the u.s. government we have undertaken several
[57:55.440 --> 57:59.560]  projects since then we do take our employees input into account but it's
[57:59.560 --> 58:05.120]  one input we make decisions based on a variety of factors as a company we were
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.800]  new in the cloud space at that time since then thank you i have a sufficient
[58:10.800 --> 58:15.480]  answer that you did take their their feedback into account and in fact some
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.200]  of your googlers have recently sent you a letter where they've asked you to exit
[58:19.200 --> 58:23.040]  other partnerships as a consequence of ethical concerns they've asked you to
[58:23.040 --> 58:29.520]  stop doing business with american law enforcement saying that police broadly
[58:29.520 --> 58:34.200]  uphold white supremacy and that and that google should not be engaged in any
[58:34.200 --> 58:38.040]  services to police and as you well know you provide some of the most basic
[58:38.040 --> 58:42.520]  services to police like email but you also provide services that help keep our
[58:42.520 --> 58:46.880]  cops safe when they're doing their job and so my question is here in front of
[58:46.880 --> 58:51.960]  congress and the american people will you take the pledge that google will not
[58:51.960 --> 58:56.720]  adopt the bigoted anti-police policy that is requested in the most recent
[58:56.720 --> 59:03.760]  letter congressman we have a long track record of working with law
[59:03.760 --> 59:09.680]  enforcement when it is supported by due process and and and the law we push back
[59:09.680 --> 59:13.160]  against over abroad request we are transparent about the request we get
[59:13.160 --> 59:18.880]  but we have a long history of following the law and and and cooperating with
[59:18.880 --> 59:22.520]  law and understand the history i'm asking about the future to the law
[59:22.520 --> 59:26.320]  enforcement that are watching today can they rest assured that under your
[59:26.320 --> 59:32.200]  leadership google will not adopt these bigoted anti-police policies congressman
[59:32.200 --> 59:35.640]  we are committed to continue to work with law enforcement in a way that's
[59:35.640 --> 59:41.400]  consistent with law and new processes in in the u.s. well I greatly appreciate
[59:41.400 --> 59:45.040]  that and I know that will be very comforting to the police who utilize
[59:45.040 --> 59:48.960]  your services you mentioned earlier in your discussion in the discussion about
[59:48.960 --> 59:55.440]  china that your engagement in china was very limited but yet google has an ai
[59:55.440 --> 1:00:00.520]  china center the chinese academy of sciences has published a paper saying
[1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:05.800]  that that enhanced the targeting capabilities of china's j-20 fighter
[1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:10.400]  aircraft you collaborate with chinese universities that take millions upon
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:13.960]  millions of dollars from the chinese military matter of fact one of your
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:19.480]  googlers fifi lee while under your employee was cited in chinese state
[1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:24.920]  media saying china is like a sleeping giant when she wakes she will tremble
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:30.160]  the world the former secretary of defense mr. shanahan said that the lines
[1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:34.240]  have been blurred in china between commercial and military application and
[1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:40.200]  as mr. buck cited general dunford says that your company is directly aiding the
[1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:44.360]  chinese military and peter teal who actually serves on mr. zuckerberg's
[1:00:44.360 --> 1:00:48.840]  board at face book book said that google's activities with china are
[1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:55.560]  treasonous he accused you of treason so why would an american company with
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:01.920]  american values so directly aid the chinese military but have ethical
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:06.640]  concerns about working alongside the u.s. military on project maven and i
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:09.480]  understand your point about cyber security and those things but project
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:14.600]  maven was a specific way to ensure that our troops are safe on the battlefield
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:19.680]  and if you have no problem making the j-20 chinese fighter more effective in
[1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:25.680]  its targeting why why wouldn't you want to make america as effective congressman
[1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:30.440]  with respect we are not working with the chinese military it's absolutely
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:34.200]  false i had a chance to meet with general dunford personally we have
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:38.520]  clarified what we do in what we do in china compared to our peers it's very
[1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:43.160]  very limited in nature our a i want to sign as limited i'm really really proud

[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:28.640]  host here in america's darkest hour multinational corporations funding a
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:33.600]  communist violent overthrow of the u.s. government calling protesting fire
[1:03:33.600 --> 1:03:38.400]  bombing and shooting people in the head and next hour we've confirmed internal
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:42.120]  video we're going to premiere of them now activating high schoolers to go out
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:48.080]  with hammers and hit republicans in the head you have also our law enforcement
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:53.000]  sources confirming all over the united states they have armed vehicles going
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.640]  around with men in pickup trucks stopping traffic in downtown austin other
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:01.080]  areas pointing guns at people and the police are being told to stand down one
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:03.600]  man who kept doing this in front of police headquarters in front of the
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:08.560]  city council was shot dead last weekend when he pulled a gun on a man in his car
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.160]  while they had it blocked off and the man was pointing in 1847 at the innocent
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:16.000]  citizen we still don't know the man's name who turned himself into police and
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:21.280]  was released probably not white is the reason that they're not releasing the
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:25.600]  information so to make about race war roger stone came very close to being a
[1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:29.600]  political prisoner he has been arrested he has been put to the ringer he has
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:32.200]  been basically bankrupted through all of this we're going to update on that at
[1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:36.960]  the bottom of the hour but he is ready to go with what trumps facing the
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:42.520]  election fraud the media propaganda the censorship at new levels and i talked to
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:46.520]  roger during the break and i said what's your take on trumps tweet is exactly
[1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:49.920]  what i thought it would be but he's very nuanced so he'll lay it out with a
[1:04:49.920 --> 1:04:54.440]  universal mail-in voting not absentee voting which is good 2020 will be the
[1:04:54.440 --> 1:04:58.080]  most inaccurate and fraudulent election history it will be a great
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:02.720]  embarrassment the usa delay the election till people can properly securely and
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:06.920]  safely vote what does it take to do that is it the right move why is trumps
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:10.640]  saying this is it to get the topic out there and have a debate about the
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:15.280]  fraudulent mail-in ballots that are being sent to dead cats and many people
[1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:20.360]  homes were people previously lived that are now deceased so joining us is an
[1:05:20.360 --> 1:05:25.400]  election expert he was there in 2000 in the contested election in florida
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:30.000]  between gore and of course bush he successfully helped get bush in so you
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.120]  can't really think of a better expert though he doesn't like bush you know
[1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:37.480]  even sooner thereafter we can do a better expert than roger stone they wanted
[1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:42.240]  to keep out of the game but now he's in the game thanks to trump thanks to you
[1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:49.360]  with that clemency and able to give us key analysis going into 2020 95 days out
[1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:54.200]  thank you so much roger for being here thank you alex i mean the truth is i'm
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:57.800]  trying to just get reacquainted with my family figure out how i'm going to make
[1:05:57.800 --> 1:06:03.280]  living i'm obviously working very hard to finish a book on this entire ordeal but
[1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:07.600]  i thought i had to come on today because the storm clouds here very ominous in
[1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:13.840]  terms of the next presidential election i think the president has a number of
[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:19.240]  structural obstacles that are very real i believe that if we had an honest
[1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:23.080]  election that means an election in which only people who were legally eligible
[1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:27.520]  to vote voted i don't believe there's much question the president would win my
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:31.600]  problem is that i don't think that there will be an honest election at this
[1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:36.200]  point and the posturing by the democrats is very very interesting they did they
[1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:41.520]  tried the same thing in 2016 you have adam schiff anancy policy and hillary
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:46.120]  themselves saying uh trump is going to lose the election and then he's going
[1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:51.520]  to refuse to leave the white house the military will have to remove him this is
[1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:56.600]  of course preparation for the fact that they intend to steal the election and
[1:06:56.600 --> 1:07:00.920]  they want to limit the president's ability to legally object to that theft
[1:07:00.920 --> 1:07:05.160]  so it is preemptory you can see exactly what they're doing it's interesting that
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:09.160]  they tried this in 2016 if you think about it hillary kept saying well
[1:07:09.160 --> 1:07:12.880]  donald trump commit to support the winner of the election and trump being a
[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.400]  smart guy said well not till i see the results of the election not till i know
[1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:20.200]  whether it was honest or whether it was plagued by fraud little did they know
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:23.880]  that it was hillary who would be calling for a recount it was hillary who was
[1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:28.640]  going into michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania looking for extra votes that
[1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:33.680]  she could never turn up so this is this is a head fake in a sense this is the
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:39.600]  setup the president's right a mail-in ballot is really problematic 12 state
[1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:44.200]  constitutions absolutely prohibit mail-in voting of any kind you have to show up
[1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:49.880]  in person period they didn't even allow absentee ballots 35 states require a
[1:07:49.880 --> 1:07:56.520]  photo id to vote which is a very good idea how you just negate both state
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:08:01.640]  constitutional law and state law with a sweeping federal bill for mail-in
[1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:05.520]  ballots not clear to me now the california result is going to be
[1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:11.440]  corrupted no matter how you conduct at the ballot that's clear to me you have
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:16.320]  other urban centers where vote stealing is an art i don't think we're going to
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:20.560]  get an honest election and the president has to reserve his ability to
[1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:24.680]  object illegally i believe that the next election sadly is going to get
[1:08:24.680 --> 1:08:29.040]  decided in the courts what the president's done here is really quite
[1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:35.400]  brilliant he's trying to elevate the entire issue of voter fraud an issue by
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:40.400]  the way that the mainstream media keeps insisting just does not exist and the
[1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:44.480]  president himself has to talk about it because he is the one among us who is
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:49.080]  not censored it doesn't do me any good to talk about other than here on info
[1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:54.280]  wars because as you know just before i was about to be sent to a covid-19
[1:08:54.280 --> 1:08:59.000]  infested prison a prison by the way that was releasing rapists and child
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.640]  pornographers and pedophiles and bank robbers to protect them from covid-19
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:09.280]  was preparing to receive me in 20 minutes before the president commuted my
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:14.960]  sentence the dc circuit court of appeals upheld the order sending me to this
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:20.920]  this dank covid-19 infested prison so i'm thankful to god i'm thankful to the
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:27.800]  president but that same day facebook banned me for life stones roger stone
[1:09:27.800 --> 1:09:33.440]  gone stone cold truth gone stone zone gone these were the facebook pages for
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:39.640]  my websites and they claim that they did this because i own 100 fake facebook
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:44.920]  sites of pages alex i don't even own a single fake facebook believe me you
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:47.800]  don't have to tell me about massive censorship and that's the good news is
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:51.840]  we're finally seeing congress even matt gates two years ago wasn't going up
[1:09:51.840 --> 1:09:55.880]  against censorship now he gets its front and center thanks to tucker carlson
[1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:59.040]  yourself the listeners of the show we've really been at the front line now
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:03.600]  medical doctors that get up about hydroxychloroquine that the president
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:08.000]  tweets they get banned and foutsy says good banned doctors they're not allowed
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:14.080]  to have press conferences i mean this is out of control i don't disagree the i
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:18.400]  guess what they don't want the american people to know is that there is a a
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:22.720]  prescription drug that appears to be very helpful and this is not you know
[1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:27.200]  coming out of left field you've now got a number of studies i'm not a scientist
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:31.400]  there's hundreds of them look you can't get covid-19 if you have high zinc
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:35.280]  levels so here's the problem if you take hydroxychloroquine and you don't have
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:38.400]  zinc it'll pull other minerals and push them into the cells you'll have
[1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:41.760]  hallucinations that's where that happens in the military this is a malaria
[1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:45.200]  drug everybody knows about this is well known if you take zinc with hydroxychloroquine
[1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:49.680]  with vitamin d3 and vitamin c you're in like flinn you cannot die from the
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:54.320]  covid if it hasn't progressed too far it is a real virus it is a bad demonia it
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:57.760]  does kill people but it's it kills people who have the vitamin mineral
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:02.920]  deficiencies well it was a good reason to stock up on both of those i like zinc
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:07.840]  as a general immunity booster to begin with and as you know vitamin c is more
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:11.920]  effective when taken with zinc in the combination so those are have been in my
[1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:17.200]  daily regimen for many years i was very saddened to hear that herman kane
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:20.560]  passed away from covid-19 he was a very good man he was a
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:23.600]  strong supporter in my recent fight for freedom
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:27.120]  he is a great patriot was a strong supporter he was a great talk show
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:32.720]  house is what he was he was i loved his show terrific guy just a terrific guy
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:36.400]  and he broke the stereotype of course as a black conservative
[1:11:36.400 --> 1:11:40.080]  he will be missed he was a very good man of course the media will now
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:45.200]  will now focus on his passing away uh for proof of a larger narrative because
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:48.560]  we understand where they're headed keep the country locked down
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:51.760]  yeah they'd like to convince the president to shut the country down a
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:56.080]  second time uh or even tighten the lockdown you have going on now
[1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:59.280]  yesterday i traveled to nashville in order to take
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:02.960]  governor mike huckabee show uh remember i had not traveled it
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:06.640]  very far in other than to washington dc and over a year
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:10.800]  almost two years really uh and it was a ghost town nashville which is a great
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:14.720]  town was a ghost town uh and it was uh everybody of
[1:12:14.720 --> 1:12:19.040]  course like a zombie wearing their masks i certainly wore mine because i'm not
[1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:22.960]  a scientist and i don't know but i it's hard for me to
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:25.680]  believe that the projections the second time will be any
[1:12:25.680 --> 1:12:29.360]  more correct than the projections the first time let's talk about the global
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:33.200]  list and what they're going to do with covet 19 the riots the communist forces
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.040]  they're activating tell you folks this is the big one they're going for broke
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:40.240]  this is their hell mary this is time to say frosty
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:43.680]  states cracking down on social gatherings
[1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:50.240]  says cnn because fouchy says if we don't we'll see further surges
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:54.800]  in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping up the testing
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:59.280]  because the tests have been designed at the wuhan lab it turns out to
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:03.200]  be completely fraudulent they cook the whole thing up
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:06.720]  offshore in a communist dictatorship with fouchy
[1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:12.320]  bill gates and the chai comms to be directed by the u n as a giant planetary
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:16.960]  power grab and now it's all over the news that indeed bill gates has developed
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:20.560]  digital tattoos under your skin and so is google
[1:13:20.560 --> 1:13:24.000]  and they're deploying them at the airports next year
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.520]  where you'll have to have it to be able to travel oh and then soon to leave your
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:30.880]  house or go in a grocery store and the contact tracers work
[1:13:30.880 --> 1:13:33.920]  for billable indicates and the clinton's and they're going to come to your house
[1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:38.160]  and make sure you're inoculated yes we're now inside the mark of the beast
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:42.080]  resist to be enslaved another part of the great awakening is taking place
[1:13:42.080 --> 1:13:45.600]  is people that haven't even been religious or christian
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:50.160]  now see how evil is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:54.080]  europe and the us hundreds of christian icons have been
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:57.520]  burned destroyed jesus has had their heads cut off all over the
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:00.160]  country all over the philippines all over europe
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:03.680]  virgin marries are getting torn down i mean crosses are being torn down
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:07.920]  it's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was
[1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:11.840]  always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:15.760]  to make its move building beneath the surface and now it's emerged
[1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:18.720]  that's why when i ask listeners and viewers for your prayer i mean it i'm
[1:14:18.720 --> 1:14:22.560]  praying for america i'm praying for you and i know the power prayer is real and
[1:14:22.560 --> 1:14:25.520]  god hears it we need to come together and pray for even
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:29.120]  greater awakening pray for donald trump to be protected
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:33.520]  pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception
[1:14:33.520 --> 1:14:36.640]  of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:40.640]  god bless you all please pray for him for us as well
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:51.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:58.560]  you know folks are online and i see some of the comments is like oh
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:01.600]  jones claims they're after him he just says that to
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:05.760]  says that to act all cloak and dagger oh yeah if you only know
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:09.120]  and i want to explain something
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:13.680]  i'm not up here telling you how we're under a taxi feel sorry for us
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:17.280]  i'm telling you we're under attack like we're a gauge on the radiator that
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:20.320]  that's about to blow up they're coming after everybody they're not just coming
[1:15:20.320 --> 1:15:25.840]  after roger and i and i've been asked by a lot of smart people not to get into
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:30.160]  all the stuff i know and and there's reasons for that
[1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:33.360]  and there's good people inside the fbi and there's bad people inside the fbi
[1:15:33.360 --> 1:15:36.000]  i just look there's bad people in your neighborhood and there's good people
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.360]  but i can tell you this country's in a lot of trouble folks
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:44.560]  and they have successfully gotten democrats
[1:15:44.560 --> 1:15:47.760]  to be willing to do anything now you watch those hearings with nadler
[1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:51.840]  five and a half hours says you cannot go to the bathroom bill bar
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:55.440]  and then he looks over at jim jordan says i don't care what you want
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:16:00.240]  you don't matter to anybody i mean just they're delusional but what's crazy is
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:03.520]  it's like a chihuahua intimidating a a
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:08.400]  bull mastiff or a rottweiler but we roll over so we keep saying oh these
[1:16:08.400 --> 1:16:12.800]  people are a joke no they're not and now they are activating
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:16.560]  all over the country violent people not just burning courthouses or buildings
[1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:19.280]  thousands of buildings or shooting people in the head at checkpoints they
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:25.200]  have roving gangs in austin with trucks pulling up blocking
[1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:29.200]  traffic and pointing guns at families
[1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:32.720]  this is being ordered directly by the democrats
[1:16:32.720 --> 1:16:36.240]  so what you have to understand is they're building this to explode the
[1:16:36.240 --> 1:16:38.480]  country whether trump leaves or not folks they
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:41.840]  want to bring it down once and for all because the chinese and the globalists
[1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:44.080]  are funding and running this takedown of america
[1:16:44.080 --> 1:16:47.200]  they want a civil war it doesn't matter that it's not going to work for the
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:51.040]  democrats they're not thinking they're being ordered to do it because the
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:54.880]  civil war is what the globalists want to destabilize the country
[1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:58.320]  roger stone i want to get into this next segment and talk about your case
[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:01.680]  because your case is everybody's case but what do you think trump should do
[1:17:01.680 --> 1:17:05.600]  right now you know what i'm going through you know what you've gone through
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:08.720]  we can't get into a lot of it people really need to understand
[1:17:08.720 --> 1:17:12.480]  we're not this is real authoritarianism this is the nastiest
[1:17:12.480 --> 1:17:16.240]  thing i've ever even read about in the history book they're really trying
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:20.720]  a authoritarian takeover that will target everybody like trump said
[1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:23.520]  they don't want me they want to get through me to get to you
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:28.960]  and it's totally true they want america one thing became very clear in
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:32.640]  yesterday's hearing on high tech which is in my opinion still the key to this
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:35.520]  entire issue our ability to communicate to
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.560]  everybody and our ability to communicate to each other
[1:17:38.560 --> 1:17:42.960]  is the single best protection about against this effort to just take down
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.280]  individuals who the deep state considers dangerous
[1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:50.880]  unfortunately i think uh if you watch tucker carlson
[1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:55.440]  real jim jordan last night jordan has to point out that we're in the minority
[1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.680]  in the house uh and therefore at this point we have to count on the justice
[1:17:59.680 --> 1:18:02.960]  department to move forward with anti-trust action where they
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:06.480]  certainly have a strong case against these tech giants i mean
[1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:09.440]  you and i sat there in the house judiciary committee
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:14.240]  slightly before i went to trial and we we we listened to this guy pie lie over
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:18.240]  and over and over again china i couldn't even find it on a map we're
[1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:21.920]  not doing business in china no your your cell phone doesn't track you that's
[1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:26.000]  false i mean yet i was charged with lying to congress
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.880]  even though other things i made misstatements about were completely
[1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:32.800]  innocuous they were immaterial so again the two
[1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:36.160]  tiered justice system the president needs to go on
[1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:40.320]  offense it needs to go often on offense on a number of issues but
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:43.840]  the most important one still remains our economy
[1:18:43.840 --> 1:18:48.720]  this is all designed to crash our economy uh and therefore the question
[1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:52.960]  will be who best to rebuild our economy a man who is
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:57.440]  absolutely proven indisputably that he knows exactly how to do it
[1:18:57.440 --> 1:19:01.200]  a guy who got us the strongest job growth the strongest wage growth
[1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:04.160]  the highest levels of employment in american history
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:08.320]  or the prescription of a doctor who will kill the sick patient with
[1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:12.160]  higher taxes higher regulation and more and by the way i should have opened the
[1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:16.160]  interview with them attacking us uh hank johnson that thinks that islands float
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:20.000]  i'm not joking folks we forgot that he actually says guam floats is worried
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.640]  too many people will make it capsize or turn over
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:26.640]  we're so punch-trunk to being attacked you every day me every day
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:31.120]  that since you reminded me i will play it i mean we're in these hearings arm
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:34.240]  services committee hearings senate intelligence committee hearings they
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:39.120]  call us russian agents with no proof then they term the deep state loose on us
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:42.400]  in the last four years it's been a living hell this is criminal and trump
[1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:44.720]  still hasn't gotten control of the government
[1:19:44.720 --> 1:19:48.560]  here's hank johnson islands float attacking roger and i during the testimony
[1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:54.480]  actually recognizes uh mr johnson from georgia
[1:19:54.480 --> 1:20:00.080]  thank you uh general boy your opening statement reads like it was written by
[1:20:00.080 --> 1:20:04.080]  alex jones or roger stone
[1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:11.200]  do you stand by that statement yes now i'm sure that we can agree
[1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:14.160]  and then he goes into roger and how horrible roger is and then the attorney
[1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:18.000]  general doesn't agree i'm sure you watch part of it i last night i stayed up
[1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:21.120]  late i couldn't be drawn away the democrats act like
[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:25.840]  psychotic clowns and they're only getting crazier what the hell is going on
[1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:29.040]  well i really can't be called a hearing because a hearing means that both people
[1:20:29.040 --> 1:20:31.280]  speak so what happens is each one of these
[1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:34.800]  leftist demagogues stands up and gives a little speech in every case
[1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:39.600]  riddled with falsehoods or false premises and then when poor attorney general
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:43.520]  bar tries to answer they cut him off and say i'm reserving back the rest of my
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:46.960]  time so what you really heard was a soliloquy from
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:53.120]  hank johnson who did once said if we put too much military hardware on guam
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:56.720]  that the island would sink i guess he thought islands floated
[1:20:56.720 --> 1:21:00.880]  but again he was complaining about the fact that that the attorney general
[1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:05.440]  rescinded the seven to nine year sentence that was given to me by these
[1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:10.240]  radical left prosecutors who were not career line non-political
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:14.480]  prosecutors and bar had to point out to them that they were using guidelines
[1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:17.440]  that had only been used rarely in the past and then for
[1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.880]  mafia kingpins who had killed thousands of people
[1:21:20.880 --> 1:21:24.640]  so once again you'd never get the truth out of these things it was a
[1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:28.320]  circus with every democrat standing up and giving
[1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:32.400]  false recycled information about russian collusion
[1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:35.520]  i mean i couldn't watch after all i thought bar was quite effective
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.840]  when he was allowed to speak but that was very very rarely
[1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:43.200]  why is all decorum never in the history of our country all
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:47.760]  everything's thrown to the wind and and the democrats literally can't talk
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:50.560]  biden's led around by his hand now like he can't see
[1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:54.800]  i mean what and that what is going on here well it was interesting because bar
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:58.640]  basically called the mount say does and do and is any of these members do any
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:01.280]  of you object to the violence going on in the streets today
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:05.920]  and no democrats said a word i mean jerry nadler who i refer to as jerry
[1:22:05.920 --> 1:22:10.560]  nadler actually insists that there is no violence in the streets that it is a
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:13.520]  myth created by the right wing none of this is
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:17.360]  member how censorship is a myth fox news the five last night
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:20.880]  is there censorship or republicans making enough what the hell
[1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:23.840]  we have all the veritas all the documents all the proof all the
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:27.360]  admissions of massive suppression they're censoring the president now
[1:22:27.360 --> 1:22:31.840]  they're censoring medical doctors at press conferences i mean what the hell
[1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:35.600]  uh and if i were laying out a campaign plan for the president's reelection
[1:22:35.600 --> 1:22:39.520]  which i am not i would not be counting on advertising at
[1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:42.960]  multimillion dollar levels on facebook in october
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:46.160]  because i don't think that's going to happen that was one of the keys to the
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:50.960]  president's victory in 2016 very skillful geotargeting and
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:55.680]  and political targeting of certain voters via facebook which has a very
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:58.880]  good application stay there let's talk about your advice the president we come
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:00.640]  back but think about how fundamental that is
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:04.320]  all the other platforms say trump can't advertise
[1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:07.360]  but facebook and so facebook's boycotted by the atl
[1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:12.800]  for allowing political ads and then now as you said they're curtailing those
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:16.800]  yeah it is it is really a technological conundrum because you can't go back to
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.760]  broadcast television but there is a way i wish i would talk
[1:23:19.760 --> 1:23:23.680]  about when we come back when we return the blueprint for trump
[1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:26.880]  to defeat the globalist but i'm telling you it's all the planets are aligning
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:30.160]  literally and figuratively this is the most insane time ever
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:33.520]  roger stone's got a lot to cover please tell everyone you know to tune in now
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:38.000]  that's how we overpower the censors your word of mouth help yourself and help us
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.440]  there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic mask
[1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:45.520]  at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:48.240]  live darts but one of the biggest reasons is
[1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:52.640]  it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:57.040]  at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks does
[1:23:57.040 --> 1:23:59.920]  absolutely nothing to protect you from covid-19 or anything else
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:03.760]  it's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations
[1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:07.680]  and contact tracing of their openly announce it it's an active
[1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:11.760]  submission it's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down
[1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:15.440]  but a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why
[1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:19.680]  you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:23.520]  masks that you're wearing and the m95 mask only
[1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:27.440]  control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread covid-19
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:30.560]  they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back in these
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.480]  control freaks faces you buy one for 995 you get four more free
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:40.640]  they're at cost infowarstore.com there are only a few days left to take

[1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:08.000]  finally nothing moves high noon black
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:14.960]  rolling below the asphalt dry a concrete you know i can feel the danger
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:19.600]  the nation of the world and i'm repenting every middle second of jesus
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:23.200]  because the sick part of me the fleshy part of me
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:26.640]  is still ready for a fight
[1:27:29.360 --> 1:27:33.040]  but we've got to control ourselves and win in the information war
[1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:36.560]  the enemy wants a physical confrontation because they know they're losing
[1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:39.920]  we need to not have that physical confrontation we need to keep our powder
[1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:43.440]  dry and be like martin wither king or gondy or christ
[1:27:43.440 --> 1:27:46.080]  their example
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:49.680]  and that will defeat them but at a certain point if they try to collapse the
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:52.960]  whole government and come grab us out of our houses we have to go on major
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:56.720]  offense defensively and it's off the races so
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:59.680]  people know of it on there 26 years i don't get up here and
[1:27:59.680 --> 1:28:03.280]  tell people to prepare for physical operations but
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:06.880]  if trump is removed if he's killed if they do communist uprisings and burn out
[1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:09.280]  all the police stations and start announcing lists of people they're
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:12.080]  going to come grab uh you don't just go hide in the country
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.000]  from them you hit them you go right in and you go right after the
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:19.520]  leadership of the globalist and that's the only way we're going to stop a
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:23.520]  marxist linonist 1917 style takeover you remember
[1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:26.080]  two years ago i said they're planning an overthrow of the government burning down
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:29.440]  police stations uh they're you know they're saying 100 years after the
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:32.880]  bolstering revolution they want it and the media went jones is crazy no one's
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:35.840]  planning that and they wouldn't show where i was showing you the internal
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:40.240]  soros documents but now you all know it was real they
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:43.600]  were beta testing it then
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:49.200]  and so burning stuff at courthouses and throwing bombs and
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:54.480]  lasering police and shooting people to edit checkpoints that's all bad
[1:28:54.480 --> 1:28:58.800]  but what's really bad is the checkpoints with trucks and cars and men
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:03.360]  aiming guns at people
[1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:07.200]  that is the the practicing of shutting down society and having states and
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:11.440]  cities defund police and then give that big part of the budget
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:14.960]  over to leftist groups who are now contact tracers
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:19.280]  that's a soviet communist all takeover so roger
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:23.280]  this isn't about you this is about alex jones is about us all but you're like a
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:28.480]  roman standard that the enemy wants to capture so am i
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:32.800]  and if they can get that standard they think it's a big morale boost for them
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:35.760]  they said the new york times at least we have a consolation prize that
[1:29:35.760 --> 1:29:40.320]  roger stones going to prison and alex jones is being sued and be
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:43.920]  platformed and so they really are obsessed with
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:47.040]  that because we're symbols of the populist movement and of the great
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:49.760]  audience of supporters we have that are right beside us
[1:29:49.760 --> 1:29:53.280]  and so people don't know they passed a law in new york you know
[1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:57.520]  most people don't know this so that trump if he pardons people like roger
[1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:01.120]  stone they said they will prosecute you so the manhattan
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  prosecutor for those that don't know is looking to indict you again
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:08.720]  for the supposed crimes you committed federally it's totally asked backwards
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:12.560]  it's unconstitutional they don't care so i think people need to realize that
[1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:15.440]  we're not out of the woods yet and if trump loses
[1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:18.480]  i predict they're gonna get a hundred times worse
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:21.120]  and and they're gonna go for broke they've said everywhere we want to level
[1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:25.200]  trump supporters we want to bring down we want to punish them we want to
[1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.640]  defeat these populist people you know that don't just think of trump
[1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:34.160]  gets taken out things go but no no no things go into warp speed
[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:38.800]  alex it does seem to never end i mean the day after the president and an act of
[1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:43.360]  mercy and justice committed by sentence because i surely would have died
[1:30:43.360 --> 1:30:47.280]  in a coveted 19 infested prison where they wanted to put me
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:51.120]  contrary to every legal precedent contrary to the current department of
[1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:55.120]  justice and bureau of prisons regulations contrary to my health and
[1:30:55.120 --> 1:30:58.080]  my age and contrary to the conditions in that
[1:30:58.080 --> 1:31:01.040]  prison but the law didn't matter the regs didn't matter
[1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:04.960]  this was even upheld by the the circuit court of appeals
[1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:08.960]  what about new york wanting to reunite you what what's going on with that
[1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:13.920]  i have no ties to new york and i'm not sure how that could even work
[1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:18.640]  but but more precisely uh you have andrew weissman who was really the guy who
[1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:22.640]  ran the Mueller investigation opining in the Washington Post
[1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:26.080]  well we probably the new york times well we can get the truth out of roger stone
[1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:28.320]  by pulling him in front of the grand jury
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:32.000]  he had three years to pull me in front of the grand jury he never did
[1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:36.160]  there is no there is no fact to find out the new
[1:31:36.160 --> 1:31:40.000]  the new leftist chant goes roger stone
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:45.200]  maintains silence regarding misconduct by the president and traded that silence
[1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:49.600]  for clemency in his case that is completely and totally false
[1:31:49.600 --> 1:31:53.200]  they had three years and spent millions of dollars trying to find that
[1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:56.640]  uh i was not charged with that the president was not beached for that
[1:31:56.640 --> 1:32:00.880]  because it does not exist no matter how many times jerry nadleyer
[1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:04.640]  says it does it still does not exist that's right so where i was going with
[1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:07.440]  this is you're doing your appeal you only got clemency
[1:32:07.440 --> 1:32:12.080]  you do expose amy burman jackson the fraud so people need to buy the t-shirts
[1:32:12.080 --> 1:32:15.040]  they need to donate we've already gone so far with roger
[1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:17.680]  we need to push him over the top i want to thank you all for your support for
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:21.440]  roger but believe me he has been through living hell and he's now a symbol
[1:32:21.440 --> 1:32:24.560]  of the resistance they want to destroy don't let them take
[1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:28.400]  one of our main standards down we must keep the flag
[1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:31.360]  and roger you are now a flag in that fight where's the best place for people
[1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:34.880]  to donate well i think the key point here alex is
[1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:39.520]  that the main reason to pursue my appeal is not only to clear my name
[1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:43.920]  but also to expose the entire mother investigation
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:47.760]  and the fraudulent nature of my trial what if a
[1:32:47.760 --> 1:32:51.600]  special counsel durham does not do this the media is not going to do it
[1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:56.240]  so it becomes a forum to demonstrate how corrupt this whole thing was
[1:32:56.240 --> 1:33:00.400]  and how the russian collusion thing was a fraud uh an appeal is going to cost me
[1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:04.720]  a million dollars it's going to take a year but people can go to stone defense
[1:33:04.720 --> 1:33:07.840]  fund dot com for stone defense fund dot com
[1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:11.680]  i have no choice but to fight this out because i think it will
[1:33:11.680 --> 1:33:15.920]  explode it will expose uh and lay bear in an open court
[1:33:15.920 --> 1:33:19.520]  the utter corruption absolutely they've turned you into this character of evil
[1:33:19.520 --> 1:33:22.400]  we have to defeat that and people can also get the shirt stone
[1:33:22.400 --> 1:33:25.440]  roger stone still did nothing wrong to throw at their face where do people get
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:29.520]  the ultimately politically incorrect shirt they can go to fight back dot
[1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:33.600]  store that's fight back dot store you know alt you may not have heard this but
[1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:38.560]  just a few minutes ago uh the dc court of appeals
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:41.760]  withdrew their dismissal order against general flinn
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:44.960]  and they will now hear the flinn case unbunk meaning
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:50.560]  the entire appeals court every member uh this is a setback for general flinn
[1:33:50.560 --> 1:33:56.320]  this is just horrific just horrific uh we now know flinn did absolutely nothing
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:34:00.400]  wrong we now know definitively that he was set up
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:03.920]  that he was entrapped there is no crime here what has happened to this
[1:34:03.920 --> 1:34:07.280]  judiciary because even republicans that trump gets put in still go with the
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:10.400]  left i mean they really are just setting up themselves
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:15.600]  as an oligarchy i don't think any conservative or any republican
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:20.400]  or any trump supporter can get a fair trial in the district of columbia
[1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:23.200]  the three judge panel that made a decision about whether i should be
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:26.320]  incarcerated at the same time that michael avanotti
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:30.160]  and michael cone and rick gates are being let out of prison along with rapists
[1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:35.120]  and pedophiles and uh and bank robbers and child
[1:34:35.120 --> 1:34:38.720]  pornographers uh i had three judges one appointed by obama
[1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:42.480]  one appointed by car by clinton and one appointed by george
[1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:47.200]  h w bush they rolled three to one against me despite the law and all
[1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:50.640]  precedent this is it is very scary till you've been
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:54.320]  there you cannot understand it i had it's not just dc it's it's
[1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:58.320]  happening to me in canada kit in austin texas i mean reality has
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:01.440]  nothing to do with i have judges look at my lawyers and they go
[1:35:01.440 --> 1:35:04.480]  give us the sandy hook marketing we know you made your fortune off sandy i'm
[1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:07.520]  like we barely ever talked about it
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:10.400]  what are you talking about they're like no we know you have and they go okay
[1:35:10.400 --> 1:35:13.840]  well we're going to default your case if you don't give us the sandy hook info
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.760]  and again it's all those lawyers and bloomberg and the anti-gun
[1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:21.920]  lobby living off of sandy hook for their own donations
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:25.200]  and then saying that we talk about sandy hook you've been on my show you've
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:28.080]  been you've been on the air with us for five years how many times you heard me
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:31.280]  talk about sandy hook roger i've never talked to you about it i've
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:35.120]  never heard you talk about it on the air doesn't mean you haven't but i mean
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:38.480]  four chan thought it was staged we looked at it some probably did
[1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:41.360]  part of 20 shows on it but you know just mentioned here and there was a thing
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:43.920]  going on and and again they're making it my
[1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:46.800]  identity and doing frontline specials you were in it
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:50.240]  all about how he's sending people to our houses you know and the guys in the
[1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:53.440]  dark because jones is after him you know the guys regularly on tv not in the
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:56.560]  dark it's all i mean it's all making it my identity when
[1:35:56.560 --> 1:35:59.600]  it's their identity they're the ones that live off of it
[1:35:59.600 --> 1:36:03.200]  and raise the money off of it and and violate free speech off of it
[1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:06.640]  when you come back roger i want to cover the waterfront with you i want to ask
[1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:10.480]  you because i guarantee you if you say roger stone
[1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:14.640]  has a message to donald trump what you say what you already reported
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:17.200]  whatever else you want to add to him about going on the offense what he needs
[1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:19.280]  to do i want you because you're already fired up
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:22.800]  but i want you to take a big shot of expresso when you come back in five
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:27.120]  minutes i want roger stone briefs trump on 2020

[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:33.040]  to president trump because you the listeners are badass and you're going
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:37.040]  to share those links we'll be right back
[1:36:37.040 --> 1:36:41.760]  the bbc estate run media in the uk and they've come out with a detailed
[1:36:41.760 --> 1:36:46.160]  article it's linked on info wars dot com saying
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:50.480]  you will have to have forced inoculations multiple times a year

[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:03.600]  fun the microsoft website now officially has
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:07.280]  announced the digital tattoo we exposed this six months ago
[1:37:07.280 --> 1:37:10.400]  how bill gates was funding it and they had hundreds of news articles attacking
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:13.760]  and saying it wasn't true this is a tactic they use
[1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:17.280]  first they announce it we say it's a bad idea they say that's crazy we didn't do
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:20.960]  it they introduced the idea to you then they come back and announce it again
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:24.160]  thinking you have no memory this is a criminal
[1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:29.760]  takeover this is the line in the sand we must say no we must expose the fraud of
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:33.040]  covet 19 this entire house of evil is built on

[1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:08.720]  everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed
[1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:12.480]  why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:15.920]  because they intubate them putting a tube in their lungs
[1:38:15.920 --> 1:38:20.800]  and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen

[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:16.160]  the country is fighting for its life i do not have words
[1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:20.240]  to describe to you how horrible this is how sickening this is
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:24.480]  how disgusting this is but i'm not demoralizing you i'm saying the only
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:28.720]  thing you have now is to speak up and say no now
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:31.680]  no to the new order no to globalism no to the end of the country
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:34.720]  we will win but we have to admit how much trouble we're in
[1:43:34.720 --> 1:43:39.920]  roger stone your emergency briefing message to the president right now
[1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:43.280]  in the next five minutes you have the floor i guarantee you know this the
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:45.840]  president calls you we're going to get this message to him
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:49.200]  you said he's to go on the offense roger stone repeat what you said and add to
[1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:52.960]  it well alex i'm happy to do that because i have
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:57.840]  a very deep affection for the president and he literally just saved my life
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:01.440]  and i know a lot of the people around him told him not to do it but an act in a
[1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:06.480]  humanitarian act of mercy and an enormously courage courageous
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:10.560]  act in a presidential year he stepped up so my family and i
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:14.640]  will always be indebted to him and i will always love him i do think he needs to
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:18.960]  do several things one i would not count on the uh on the
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:25.840]  internet social media platforms for my major push advertising in fall
[1:44:25.840 --> 1:44:29.600]  i would look to sending messages directly to text to
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:33.280]  by text to cell phones a technology that's much tougher
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:37.680]  to block uh and uh you can match the voter files
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:40.960]  with cell phone numbers and reach people effectively that way
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:44.960]  with your television ads with your print messages i would look at that
[1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:48.480]  technology secondarily these debates are going to be crucial
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:52.160]  donald trump is an amazing debater because he's a showman
[1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:55.440]  he knows how to make a simple point and get people to understand it
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:59.920]  he doesn't get lost in the weeds but i don't know that he should agree to a
[1:44:59.920 --> 1:45:03.680]  debate schedule laid out by the presidential commission on
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:07.840]  debates because it is not appointed by the president it is not a commission
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:11.760]  and it's not about debates as the president of the united states he can
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:15.200]  command where and when he wants to debate he could say
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:19.440]  hey joe i'm doing it on fox next thursday are you going to be there or not
[1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:23.600]  he could just choose when and how he debates what you don't need
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:27.600]  is the presidential commission of uh on debates
[1:45:27.600 --> 1:45:31.920]  inserting the their moderator because we've seen in the past what happens
[1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:35.280]  when the moderator is in the tank we've seen that
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:38.800]  and what we need is a no holds barred toe-to-toe
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:42.880]  biden to trump and if that happens donald trump will emerge victories in
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:46.320]  all three debates and those debates in this race
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:50.480]  will be more crucial than ever before i think we have to fight
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:45:55.520]  mail-in ballots on a state-by-state basis the problem here is we don't know
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:58.960]  how much geographical dislocation
[1:45:58.960 --> 1:46:05.040]  covid-19 is likely to to cause the president floating the idea of moving
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:09.760]  the election as two predictable results the left will say you see he's a
[1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:13.920]  dictator he refuses to lose he refuses to leave
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:17.760]  this is outrageous i don't think that's the point here the point here is that we
[1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:20.720]  we don't know what the future brings and we want an
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:24.560]  honest election the president was very clear he said it three weeks ago
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:29.120]  if i lose i lose this is nonsense this idea that i would try to hang around
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:32.480]  what people don't understand is he he didn't run for this job
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:35.760]  because he had to have it he ran for it to save
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.120]  the country he ran for it because he didn't like to see
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:42.560]  he didn't like what he saw in terms of the fact that this country was hurtling
[1:46:42.560 --> 1:46:46.080]  over the plane and mail-in ballots are a violation of federal state law
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:49.280]  they need to be stopped that's why he's challenging it and they're trying to set
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:53.200]  the precedent that he's not allowed to challenge their fraudulent activities
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:56.720]  that's not challenging an election that's challenging fraud
[1:46:56.720 --> 1:47:01.040]  and he has to preserve that option until we see the results who can judge
[1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:05.840]  whether they're honest or dishonest who we one of the things you have to do is
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.760]  match the total number of voters with the number of people in each machine
[1:47:09.760 --> 1:47:13.200]  that needs to be done on a precinct by precinct basis
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:18.160]  fraud is not that hard to detect it does happen but it happens in the urban
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:21.360]  areas mostly i think they're fixing to steal
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:25.680]  this election the president should not give up any of his rights to challenge
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:28.640]  that if that is the case if we get an honest
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:32.160]  election and he should lose he made it clear that he would withdraw
[1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:35.520]  but i don't think that will happen it better not happen because
[1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:40.320]  he is the last best hope for this country he's the only one who can revive the
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:43.200]  economy he has rebuilt our military strength
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:47.200]  he continues to struggle to keep our borders closed but they will throw
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:50.080]  anything they can at him first it was russia
[1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:55.120]  then it was ukraine then it was the manifestation of covid
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:47:58.560]  and now adam schiff has cooked up a whole new
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:02.880]  russian collusion meme what do you see this one alex i mean that they
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:06.560]  they just will never stop they'll never stop
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:10.560]  until the president beats them and then he cleans house
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:13.600]  and they only get more insane i get this because they've never been punished
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:16.800]  that's the problem with bill bar and durham i love bar speeches i love what
[1:48:16.800 --> 1:48:19.760]  he says he seems like a really gracious smart guy i'm impressed with
[1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:24.400]  with his overall acumen and his
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:28.720]  amazing oratory skills and and his ability to stay calm i mean the guy's
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:32.960]  obviously very astute and very very accomplished but
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:36.320]  still no action against the deep state for an attempted coup against the
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:39.040]  president and the american people i'm pissed
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:43.520]  that's why that's why i must get my case to appeal that's why i can demonstrate
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:46.400]  the rank corruption of the Mueller investigation
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:50.800]  if i can get my case to appeal that's why i'm pushing so hard to raise the money
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:54.080]  to do so i could just walk away at this point not put
[1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:58.400]  myself in harm's way because if i win a new trial
[1:48:58.400 --> 1:49:01.680]  then i would most likely be in front of that same judge
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:05.600]  i question whether i can get a fair trial in front of that judge but let's take
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:09.920]  this one step at a time right now my highest priority is doing
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:14.320]  everything i can as a private citizen uh to help the president get reelected i'm
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:17.600]  working on a long piece about what the president
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:20.400]  must do written from a very friendly point of view
[1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:24.160]  because i the strategy has to has to fit
[1:49:24.160 --> 1:49:27.200]  the candidate's talents these guys have one of the greatest
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:31.120]  candidates at all time but the rallies which give him so much energy
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:34.640]  and which have been media events unto themselves
[1:49:34.640 --> 1:49:37.680]  in which thousands of voters are registered to vote by the way many of
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:40.800]  them democrats uh it does not look to me like
[1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:45.040]  covid-19 is going to allow the set piece rallies that had been
[1:49:45.040 --> 1:49:47.520]  trump's strength but i think he should i think
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:50.720]  look the the democrats are all marching and it's wonderful when they do
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:54.000]  and then they demonize him when he had his tulsa rally and make up all these
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.240]  lies i think he just goes back to it says we're
[1:49:56.240 --> 1:49:59.440]  tough we're americans come at your own risk i think that's the answer
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:02.880]  i think he's not having more rallies because he saw his rallies
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:08.320]  sabotaged by the local tabular that wouldn't let the people in
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:12.400]  well and by uh you know by a chinese app tip top
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:15.920]  where they pulled a classic dirty trick i hate to say it but the
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:19.600]  president's campaign manager got punked by a bunch of 13 year olds
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:23.120]  that cannot happen again ever those that don't know
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:27.200]  they went and got the tickets and then parskill didn't check to see where the
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:30.720]  orders i mean if i was getting a bunch of orders we go look if they're real
[1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:34.160]  and if it's all a bunch of you know 13 year olds or whatever we contact them
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:37.200]  and then we're like oh this is this is a scam if they were all bragging on
[1:50:37.200 --> 1:50:40.880]  tiktok for a week and then he goes oh we got a million and a half
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:44.880]  rsvp's i mean parskill really showed him i don't even mean to parskill but that
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:49.840]  was just amateur behavior well and we had to turn real people away
[1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:52.960]  because all the tickets had been sold to people who weren't real weren't really
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:55.920]  coming i mean it really was a tragedy but i guarantee
[1:50:55.920 --> 1:50:59.280]  this it won't happen again even better on that
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:03.120]  all right roger stone roger stone what is the best website to get that t-shirt

[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:31.200]  americans have had freedom for so long and most americans
[1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:35.520]  were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history
[1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:39.280]  that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate the american
[1:51:39.280 --> 1:51:43.120]  way truth justice due process the right to self-defense
[1:51:43.120 --> 1:51:45.680]  private property because we've had it so long we just think
[1:51:45.680 --> 1:51:49.120]  that's how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the
[1:51:49.120 --> 1:51:53.040]  social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up
[1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:56.160]  humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower
[1:51:56.160 --> 1:51:59.920]  the weak as well as the strong is something the west invented
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:03.120]  and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by the
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:07.120]  technocrats by the globalist who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth
[1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:10.560]  that we need to be cold and dumb down and put into
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:14.240]  subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate and command
[1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:17.920]  you're even lucky enough to stay alive and that's what covet 19 is

[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:39.360]  the race war that i mean i'm not here to kiss black people's butts i mean black
[1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:41.280]  people are good they're bad like everybody else
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:45.040]  but i mean it's not black people at these events there's pockets of black
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:47.920]  folks it's mainly white academics and white government
[1:55:47.920 --> 1:55:52.720]  workers who are communists who who want to paint their revolution as
[1:55:52.720 --> 1:55:56.240]  black against white when they're when it's a red revolution
[1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:59.920]  i don't mean the washington redskins folks or native americans i mean red
[1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:04.080]  communist movement red for the blood they want to spill
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:08.400]  and now they say the american eagles not seeing them and the flags bad and and
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:12.160]  ban it and now they're saying ban the finish flag and the dutch flag and the
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:16.480]  german flag and the british flag it's a load of bull
[1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:19.840]  and speaking of that we got these in a couple of days ago
[1:56:19.840 --> 1:56:23.120]  i'm going to be wearing one of these very soon out in about town
[1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:28.880]  they came out and said trumps campaign flag of an american eagle with a flag
[1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:32.400]  under it was a nazi that's ridiculous ladies and gentlemen i guess the
[1:56:32.400 --> 1:56:35.760]  mexican flag is nazi too and you know the russian flag
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:38.880]  no the eagle is the most popular symbol of countries
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:42.000]  and it is the shield with the betsy ross flag
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:46.640]  out of many one on the back it says info wars dot com
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:50.800]  and it says keep america great i think this is the best shirt we've ever
[1:56:50.800 --> 1:56:54.080]  produced i really wanted to be the campaign 2020
[1:56:54.080 --> 1:56:57.840]  shirt for this epic battle for the republic i think this is the uniform
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:57:01.360]  to wear ladies and gentlemen so you've got one with the american eagle with 20
[1:57:01.360 --> 1:57:05.520]  stars around it looks awesome and then we've got this other one
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:09.360]  that's the big eagle that doesn't have the 20 stars on it and it looks just as
[1:57:09.360 --> 1:57:11.840]  good maybe even better i can't decide which one's my favorite
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:14.720]  i kind of like the one with the stars but then i look at this one i like this
[1:57:14.720 --> 1:57:18.880]  big old eagle that's wings out it's the coolest looking eagle

[1:59:50.560 --> 1:59:53.840]  ladies and gentlemen we have breaking intel
[1:59:53.840 --> 1:59:56.720]  that feeds into all the other big reports we've been bringing you from law
[1:59:56.720 --> 2:00:00.000]  enforcement and others that they're not just fire bombings of
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:02.560]  federal and state courthouses and thousands of buildings being burned
[2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:06.000]  down people being shot at illegal communist checkpoints
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:10.480]  we now have major leftist groups funded by sorrows the democrats
[2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:14.880]  like the sunrise movement recently renamed from their previous communist
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:17.840]  name activating not just college but high school
[2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:21.280]  students and even middle school students to carry out
[2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:25.760]  violence these are all malice youth brigade you think your child's joining
[2:00:25.760 --> 2:00:29.200]  an anti-racism group you think you're joining some progressive group
[2:00:29.200 --> 2:00:34.560]  and then they get programmed online by the left to carry out sexual blackmail
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:39.120]  that's on video communist attacks and we have footage of this
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:42.880]  recorded inside the zoom meetings and so they are
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:46.960]  really activating their organizations discarding the old name coming up with
[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:50.320]  the new revolutionary name and this is just one of many of these organizations
[2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:54.160]  doing this so this is the sunrise movement milley recap what you and others
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:57.840]  discovered in the last six months the previous reports you put out and then
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:00.880]  give people a breakdown of what they're about to see and how big this is
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:04.800]  because your intel absolutely confirms all of our intel
[2:01:04.800 --> 2:01:09.520]  not what we're seeing on the streets but a major escalation and the media saying
[2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:13.520]  firebombing shooting people killing people burning buildings is protest
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:17.200]  and and so now they're just beta testing going from beta
[2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:20.800]  into operational so milley weaver thanks for joining us
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:24.720]  thank you so much alex well we still have our undercover
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:29.200]  infiltrator inside the sunrise movement it took our undercover
[2:01:29.200 --> 2:01:33.680]  like a year and a half to be you know fully embedded into this organization
[2:01:33.680 --> 2:01:38.720]  and now it's going on about two years so the other day the undercover was
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.800]  pointed out by the leadership inside the sunrise movement
[2:01:42.800 --> 2:01:48.000]  to an instagram video which was signaling their uprising that they are
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.320]  going to be activated and it was pointing them to a zoom conference that
[2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:56.800]  was held last night at 8 p.m. well we have all of it
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:01:59.760]  we have their plans we know what they're going to do
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:03.360]  we know that they're now going to be hitting the homes
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:09.520]  of republican and conservative politicians and prominent people so they
[2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:14.240]  are fully going forward they've announced a 100 day siege
[2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:19.440]  they've changed their logo to what resembles an all-seeing eye
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:25.440]  and they are mirroring their movement after the organization from the 1860s
[2:02:25.440 --> 2:02:31.200]  called the wide awakes and if you do your research into the wide awakes you find
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:34.880]  that that group well although they were republican
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:39.760]  Abraham Lincoln supporters that were pro abolitionists
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.680]  they're modeling themselves after their works and what they did was they went to
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:46.960]  the polls the voting booths and they kind of
[2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:50.480]  policed the voting booths and made sure that
[2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:54.640]  that ballots were valid or genuine before they were allowed to be cast
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:57.920]  so they talk about in these zoom chats how they
[2:02:57.920 --> 2:03:01.920]  themselves are now going to be at the voting locations and that
[2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:07.040]  they're going to be policing and watching and going after Trump's
[2:03:07.040 --> 2:03:11.200]  poll watchers and so what we're seeing here is this
[2:03:11.200 --> 2:03:14.480]  movement towards okay let's take it to the suburban homes
[2:03:14.480 --> 2:03:17.600]  let's take it to the homes of these republican
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:21.680]  prominent people and politicians and that they're also going to be taking
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:24.640]  this to the voting booths if the voting polling
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:28.720]  locations are allowed to be open so that's what we're seeing right now
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:34.240]  it's very alarming Alex and you've got videos we're going to get to
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:38.160]  here in a moment where they're laying out again going out and intimidating
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:42.400]  people at the voting places polling places and going to
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:46.320]  republicans homes like Mitch McConnell like Alan Jones
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:49.360]  like Tucker Carlson and others this has already happened to everybody
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:52.240]  and they're getting more and more violent rhetoric we're going to kill you
[2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:56.320]  evil turtle uh i'm not saying that that's what they say to Mitch McConnell
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:03:59.280]  i mean this is out of control they're saying all police are evil
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:03.920]  Austin City Council has a resolution in their budget to blow up the police
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:06.960]  station as a symbol of ending police hate
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:09.840]  whatever that means i mean this is really a Bolshevik
[2:04:09.840 --> 2:04:15.120]  malice takeover yes they specifically say this is not a protest
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:19.360]  they say this is a haunting and that they're going to be at people's homes
[2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:23.200]  day after day night after night keeping people awake and harassing them
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:27.200]  it's terrorism Alex and they say that they're they talk about how they're
[2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:31.040]  going to expect police to be more aggressive against them
[2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:34.560]  since they're taking it to residential neighborhoods versus
[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:40.480]  the typical political sit-ins at you know representatives offices so to speak
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:45.200]  but they're taking what they've done is you know they said the purge shows
[2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:49.360]  right-wingers going to liberals houses no this is the left coming to our houses
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:52.000]  and people say well they're pathetic we've got guns well the McCluskey's have
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:55.200]  been indicted uh in st louis for people on their property saying we're going to
[2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:58.080]  kill you they just pointed guns at them and said get off our property totally
[2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:01.520]  legal open and shut they're indicted by a Soros operative
[2:05:01.520 --> 2:05:05.760]  we've put up with so much so long now that they literally believe we're going
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:09.280]  to roll over again and i guess america probably will
[2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:13.760]  well what americans need to realize here is they also have guns themselves
[2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:17.440]  and tifa has guns black lives matter has guns
[2:05:17.440 --> 2:05:20.480]  they have ar-15s i mean it wasn't that long ago
[2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:24.800]  oenshorer was even harassed by some and tifa in austin with guns
[2:05:24.800 --> 2:05:30.480]  they have guns so what are you going to do when a large mass of riot and group
[2:05:30.480 --> 2:05:34.240]  rolls up outside of your house your neighborhood and they have guns
[2:05:34.240 --> 2:05:37.360]  sure you have a gun but have you organized with your neighbors
[2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:40.720]  have you prepared for what you're starting to happen and that's what people
[2:05:40.720 --> 2:05:43.280]  have to understand is they're now going into the suburbs
[2:05:43.280 --> 2:05:45.680]  and then when people fight back to defend themselves it's going to be called
[2:05:45.680 --> 2:05:49.440]  terrorism by the media they're going to be going and targeting
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:54.000]  people one by one if they as a group go and target let's say tucker carlsson's
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:58.160]  house or mitch mcconnell's house or target all these houses
[2:05:58.160 --> 2:06:01.920]  in a massive group each day and who knows
[2:06:01.920 --> 2:06:04.960]  i mean they this is the same group that says burning down buildings is a
[2:06:04.960 --> 2:06:08.480]  legitimate form of protest and the police have been told if you support
[2:06:08.480 --> 2:06:11.840]  citizens you'll get in trouble from your police chiefs cops seem to do their
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:14.880]  jobs they'll be heroes and and and call out this
[2:06:14.880 --> 2:06:19.360]  confrontation stop following orders i mean it's time to do your job
[2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:25.840]  and her skype just froze it should come back here in a moment really we were
[2:06:25.840 --> 2:06:28.480]  joining us we're going to come back in a few minutes
[2:06:28.480 --> 2:06:33.040]  after break and we've got a ton of footage we haven't gotten to yet
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:36.320]  from the sunrise movement that just got taped this is what they're activating
[2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:39.440]  let's play clip number one part of it as we go to break here
[2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:44.400]  sunrise leaders call to action they call for 100 day siege well america is
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:47.840]  under siege right now here it is all right
[2:06:47.840 --> 2:06:52.000]  sorry to cut the music off i was really vibing but i do want us to get started
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:56.400]  this is really the moment that this broken system could all come crumbling
[2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:59.760]  down but it's up to us to take action and make it happen
[2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:03.520]  and the people who are supposed to be in charge the people who are supposed to
[2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:07.760]  be protecting us are either asleep sleeping through the crisis or
[2:07:07.760 --> 2:07:11.200]  actually even worse the very architects and profiteers
[2:07:11.200 --> 2:07:14.880]  of this death economy we can't occupy their offices so
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:18.560]  we have to bring the crisis to their doorsteps and we're going to mobilize
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:22.240]  outside the homes of politicians in the middle of the night to wake them up to
[2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:26.800]  the devastating realities we face that's right y'all no justice no sleep
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:30.800]  and this isn't just your regular protest this is a daily haunting to make it
[2:07:30.800 --> 2:07:34.320]  clear that our generation is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to the
[2:07:34.320 --> 2:07:36.880]  revolution in the streets and at the ballot box
[2:07:36.880 --> 2:07:41.760]  my dream is that we bring these failed and corrupt institutions
[2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:46.320]  to their knees and we build something new something founded with ideas and
[2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:50.320]  policies we know to be right and just and necessary
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:54.000]  so this month-long siege that we're going to wage to
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:57.680]  break down these anti-democratic walls in fear of future
[2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:01.360]  and let me just say that i love the term siege because i feel like that's
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:05.280]  exactly what we're going to do and i all encourage you to go read the book of
[2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:08.720]  pd page for what a siege is because have that expectation
[2:08:08.720 --> 2:08:12.160]  we've been failed and forgotten and we need to tell the world that we're not
[2:08:12.160 --> 2:08:16.000]  taking this anymore that they will see us
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:19.600]  they will feel us and they will hear us until they are deaf with our that's it
[2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:23.120]  i'm going to mayor nadler's house or adler's house
[2:08:23.120 --> 2:08:26.800]  keep going siege over the course of one year and nine days which was a fact i
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:29.680]  learned today every single day from now until the election
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:32.800]  is a day we're preparing for ballot time battle
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:36.480]  and the post-election eruption of our pent-up anger
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:39.920]  that means showing up to houses of politicians everywhere who are
[2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:43.200]  reading on a script my favorite line no justice
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:46.720]  no sleep or wide awake protesters even showed up
[2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:51.200]  outside of the the portland maria uh or trump's secret police sleeps
[2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:55.200]  chanting no justice no sleep these people all want to get in the country
[2:08:55.200 --> 2:08:57.280]  so they can bitch and complain and get free stuff
[2:08:57.280 --> 2:09:00.480]  none of these people work all across the country they want to run your life
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:04.480]  have no possibility of continuing to sleep until they get away
[2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:07.200]  the most powerful evil rich people are the public
[2:09:07.200 --> 2:09:12.000]  who run deathhands and power looks like these are such disgusting things
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:16.080]  we will haunt these architects of the death economy we will march into their
[2:09:16.080 --> 2:09:17.760]  homes oh really you're going to nikey go to the
[2:09:17.760 --> 2:09:21.040]  brown james house and sweatshops we will go to apple
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:23.760]  to their homes and make it plain and simple for them
[2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:26.480]  yep yeah back up for where they go to this lady when we come back and which
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:29.280]  that's good guys we're gonna cut the clip off thank you uh when we come back
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:32.480]  we're gonna back that up to that point we're gonna play that the death
[2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:35.200]  economy yeah yeah that's right
[2:09:35.200 --> 2:09:39.280]  this is a pandemic survival alert and the most time sensitive messages
[2:09:39.280 --> 2:09:43.520]  you will hear this year you still have time to plan a one acre crisis garden
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:47.760]  and secure a supply of your own nutrient dense food but time is running out and
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:51.680]  it's one deadline you don't want to miss who should plan a crisis garden
[2:09:51.680 --> 2:09:55.840]  individuals families churches communities anyone or any group that sees
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:59.360]  hard times ahead let's face it even the mainline media is talking
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:02.880]  about food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers

[2:14:31.600 --> 2:14:35.600]  out and start attacking people but if you listen to some of the
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:40.720]  audio and video we're about to play here they're saying this evil death
[2:14:40.720 --> 2:14:44.480]  economy we're going to dismantle america and america is not perfect nothing is
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:48.480]  but never anything about communist china or millions in death camps
[2:14:48.480 --> 2:14:51.440]  never anything about keeping babies alive and selling their organs
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:55.840]  it's all just it's racist it's bad it's white we got to destroy it
[2:14:55.840 --> 2:14:59.840]  and it's always women hired and trained to lead
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:03.520]  other young girls into the malice youth brigades now type in
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:09.920]  malice great leap forward cultural revolution youth brigades

[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:19.120]  chinese malice uprising children fighting in mal's army malice youth
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:22.480]  brigades you can see it and that's the model they admit when you go to these
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:25.920]  things of what they're doing so let's go back to that audio
[2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:29.520]  they come up with a hundred day siege and how they're gonna get america here it
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:33.840]  is i knew that if we could replicate this
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:38.800]  and mass numbers all across the country corrupt leaders would have no
[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:42.480]  possibility of continuing to sleep until they give way
[2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:47.200]  this campaign is going to show the public what a threat to power
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:52.080]  looks like so for the next 100 days we will haunt these architects of the
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:57.520]  death economy we will march into their homes we will march into their homes
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:02.320]  we will march into their homes and make it plain and simple for them
[2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:07.120]  we are wide awake to the role in which they are crafting this nightmare
[2:16:07.120 --> 2:16:11.680]  and they are about to be too so now we're going to take
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:16.320]  actions they cannot ignore so as we ramp up to the election
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:20.240]  we know there's a lot that's going to be stopping black and brown people and
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:23.600]  young people from voting polling places are being shut down
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:27.760]  and we've heard that trump has called for 50k poll watchers
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:32.240]  which we all know that means there's going to be an army of terrorizers
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:36.800]  to scare black and brown people from voting it's going to be rough
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:40.640]  that's what we need to show up like never before despite the potential for
[2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:44.000]  change that's coming we still have to deal with biden right and i know
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:47.840]  literally every time i open the news he's gone and said something else terrible
[2:16:47.840 --> 2:16:51.760]  the democratic party is banging us over the head with we got to defeat trump
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:55.840]  and this really speaks to me right we need an administration we can control
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:59.760]  we need to be able to pull the strings if we want to be able to implement the
[2:16:59.760 --> 2:17:03.600]  visionary future we need right now we are building a force that is
[2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:07.360]  powerful enough to strike fear into the hearts of politicians on
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:10.720]  either side of the aisle we're talking with youth groups leading the movement
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:14.800]  for black lives and other youth partners to build this youth block this
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:20.160]  multi-issue multi-racial so this is all based on malice principles in their
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:24.960]  own words but china doesn't basically let black people in they're super racist
[2:17:24.960 --> 2:17:28.960]  and china puts christians hindu's and muslims in death camps
[2:17:28.960 --> 2:17:33.120]  but all these women are running around screaming how much america sucks
[2:17:33.120 --> 2:17:36.800]  i mean these these these are idiots ladies and gentlemen
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:40.400]  absolute morons millie weaver you've been going through thousands of documents
[2:17:40.400 --> 2:17:44.240]  all these videos to see them now this video is just a few days old saying
[2:17:44.240 --> 2:17:47.280]  we're activated you know the hammer comments are coming up
[2:17:47.280 --> 2:17:52.400]  we're gonna go out we're gonna do all this this is just insane
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:56.480]  it's scary alex they are saying they're going to be marching into people's
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:17:59.680]  homes that should terrify everyone this is
[2:17:59.680 --> 2:18:03.680]  these people are like a terrorist organization they want to go around and
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:07.440]  harass people and violently riot and use
[2:18:07.440 --> 2:18:10.800]  radical action to forcefully get their way
[2:18:10.800 --> 2:18:14.480]  these people are not going to stop and that's why i say quote
[2:18:14.480 --> 2:18:18.080]  overthrow the united states is necessary and the time is now
[2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:20.880]  and again the most powerful corporations in the world and the chinese
[2:18:20.880 --> 2:18:23.760]  communists are funding the college and high school students
[2:18:23.760 --> 2:18:27.280]  to want a violent overthrow this is criminal
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:31.440]  exactly and they're all leading this up to election day and election time and
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:35.680]  even the aftermath of of the election so everyone needs to be prepared and
[2:18:35.680 --> 2:18:38.560]  that is the main reason why i decided this
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:42.400]  message needs to get out now i know we've been talking about that we've been
[2:18:42.400 --> 2:18:45.920]  working on a documentary we have so much information we're all putting together
[2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:49.920]  and it takes time to do that but that's why i decided all right this
[2:18:49.920 --> 2:18:53.920]  needs to get out now this is an urgent message to the american people
[2:18:53.920 --> 2:18:57.040]  they need to know that they need to prepare themselves and their families
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:01.040]  to be able to defend themselves because these radicals are going to go around
[2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:05.520]  and hit the suburbs they are serious they don't care if they have to smash
[2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:08.720]  trump supporters in order to win the election they're going to do what they
[2:19:08.720 --> 2:19:12.880]  need to do because they are so brainwashed it looks like
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:16.480]  george soros is going to get some more happy making days alex
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:19.200]  i mean he's behind some of these groups and organization
[2:19:19.200 --> 2:19:22.800]  and he's overthrown more than 15 countries most recent ukraine
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:26.000]  they did the whole arab spring for those that don't know they have former
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:29.520]  military members that are communists now men
[2:19:29.520 --> 2:19:33.840]  training these kids that have been paid for by soros and then they all believe
[2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:37.280]  they're going to get positions in power the little young dumb kids don't know
[2:19:37.280 --> 2:19:39.280]  that they just believe they're bringing
[2:19:39.280 --> 2:19:42.720]  equality and they're sad for george george floyd uh and they're you know
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:46.000]  there's socialist mothers are supporting and there's no dad in the home
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  but these people really believe they're about to have their way with us and i
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:54.240]  got news for them they're not going to have their way with us
[2:19:54.240 --> 2:19:57.680]  yeah i mean there's going to be a lot of americans that stand up and fight back
[2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:01.600]  and i hope that's what americans do because this is unacceptable this is
[2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:05.200]  unamerican this is a communist revolution they think that they're going to be
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:08.960]  able to take america over in a hundred days well i have news for them
[2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:12.400]  there's a lot of patriots out there that are going to be in the way of that
[2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:16.240]  and as long as the patriots are awake and know what's happening
[2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:18.720]  they're going to be able to stop it and that's right and they even have the
[2:20:18.720 --> 2:20:21.520]  classic communist model where they're going to collapse things
[2:20:21.520 --> 2:20:25.840]  things are going to collapse but then it's okay they'll be the new normal
[2:20:25.840 --> 2:20:29.120]  and they'll teach us then they'll reeducate us into the future i mean
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:33.440]  it's all laid out it's all planned well it's another interesting thing that
[2:20:33.440 --> 2:20:38.160]  they had this this conference zoom call on the bohemian groves
[2:20:38.160 --> 2:20:41.600]  cremation of care night so it's just a little
[2:20:41.600 --> 2:20:44.480]  interesting that that they announced their 100 day
[2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:49.040]  siege for their violent revolution on that day
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:52.880]  so just goes to show i mean this is the same group that is connected to lucis
[2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:58.400]  trust and yeah those are all very important occult days
[2:20:58.400 --> 2:21:02.160]  exactly so it's odd that they would announce this on that day
[2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:05.760]  don't you think alex milley it's all occult these are all alice or crally
[2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:10.800]  groups that's all admitted um i think trump's winning in the
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:15.200]  real numbers but there's such election fraud coming i'm really concerned i
[2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:17.440]  don't know the listeners understand that i'm not just saying we're in deep
[2:21:17.440 --> 2:21:20.240]  trouble for effect i'm really want people to know
[2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:23.600]  they better get active they better get vocal people what do you think everybody
[2:21:23.600 --> 2:21:26.400]  out there can do to make sure we understand that the globalists are
[2:21:26.400 --> 2:21:30.720]  making their move right now this isn't the beta test this is it
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:34.480]  yeah they're making their move i think that people need to get organized
[2:21:34.480 --> 2:21:37.520]  one thing i've noticed with these groups with the lab
[2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:40.880]  they are extremely organized and that's because they are
[2:21:40.880 --> 2:21:44.560]  these are um ngos and other intelligence contractors
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:49.280]  they're behind this oh yeah using classic cult program
[2:21:49.280 --> 2:21:52.640]  exactly and so people need to get organized they need to know that there
[2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:57.200]  is a real threat to their safety and they're in their country
[2:21:57.200 --> 2:22:01.280]  right now and they need to get organized it's not you laugh at a bunch of dumb
[2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:03.920]  14-year-old girls the ignorance is their strength
[2:22:03.920 --> 2:22:08.160]  that's why 1984 they say ignorance is strength that was a real stylistic term
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:11.440]  the fact that their followers are so dumb and so evil and so stupid
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:16.080]  is what makes them dangerous there were there were houses were 20 30 14-year-old
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:18.800]  girls 12-year-old girls would show up with butcher knives
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:21.920]  and kill whole families that didn't submit to mount
[2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:25.280]  it was little girls that led the attacks with butcher knives
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:28.160]  like children of the corn people don't know what this is and you've got the

[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:22.320]  so this this was designed on one of the top guys in the country you didn't want
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:25.040]  his name on it because obviously the political issues but we had to pay a
[2:26:25.040 --> 2:26:28.080]  lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it and we believe it
[2:26:28.080 --> 2:26:31.840]  is the best strongest but healthiest energy out there and you're saying
[2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:34.400]  that it's made your life better so that means a lot to me thank you to all your
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:37.440]  truck drivers we love you
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:43.440]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:26:43.440 --> 2:27:02.000]  again have i seen really concerned on air folks we've already seen massive
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.800]  violence people being shot in that over and over again
[2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:07.680]  that illegal common checkpoints around the country we've seen the corporate
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:11.600]  media praise it the democrats praise it the democrat leaders say there's no
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:16.000]  violence at all these we see new definitions of
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:19.280]  protesting being burning and shooting and killing people
[2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:23.600]  and we see every form of trash and garbage being pushed to do this and now
[2:27:23.600 --> 2:27:29.040]  we see activations going out to antifa blm and and in the text we're going to
[2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:33.120]  be showing on screen this next clip they talk about using hammers to go out
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:36.640]  and tell the young girls go out and use your hammers and start attacking people
[2:27:36.640 --> 2:27:39.680]  or our own vehicles been attacked by men with hammers
[2:27:39.680 --> 2:27:44.320]  and then the media made a joke about it like this is a great thing
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:48.880]  and when they burned down a homeless camp they uh blamed it on us i mean the
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:53.600]  media the establishment is working in lockstep
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:56.880]  to protect these people who've been told they can just go out and act with
[2:27:56.880 --> 2:28:00.880]  impunity and that they're going to quote blow up the austin police department
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:03.840]  that's in the official city council in fact when i say that i don't even believe
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:07.760]  it even though it's true it's in the official city budget to blow up
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:12.240]  the police department as a symbol of ending hate
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:15.120]  and they just say we don't need a police department anymore we're going to blow up
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:20.800]  the police department this is from apd source monday evening blm and other
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:24.960]  anti-police group members we're riding around downtown austin in
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:28.080]  technicals pickup trucks with two to four arm
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.160]  individuals with rifles in the back stopping cars counter flowing going
[2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:37.440]  the wrong way down streets etc apd reported on what was happening and
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:41.040]  wanted to intervene but we're told to stand down unless they started
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.320]  shooting these trucks were stopped in the middle of the road
[2:28:44.320 --> 2:28:48.800]  intimidating other motorists etc rank and fall cops were furious they weren't
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:51.920]  allowed to act we see the video feel like stop all
[2:28:51.920 --> 2:28:54.720]  ladies and point guns at them and stuff i mean it's just you can't believe
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:57.760]  they'll actually act like this just random people they don't know they attack
[2:28:57.760 --> 2:29:00.800]  you also same guy who was shot and killed when he
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:04.400]  came up and pointed his gun at a car that was surrounded had been at
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:08.560]  several other protest downtown in front of apd headquarters with his ak and it
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:11.840]  stopped vehicles in the roadway on the frontage road
[2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:16.400]  apd cops reported what he was doing but again we're told to stand down source
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:23.600]  says that actively may have been aware but captured on the hq cameras that was
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:27.040]  captured on the hq cameras they believe they also received intel briefing
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:31.120]  that antifa and related groups are planning for a takeover of the part of
[2:29:31.120 --> 2:29:35.280]  austin like chopper chas in seattle that could happen as early as this weekend
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:38.240]  they're calling for additional manpower from apd to be ready
[2:29:38.240 --> 2:29:42.960]  but no words so far apd will be allowed to act and prevent the takeover so
[2:29:42.960 --> 2:29:47.680]  it's the public activation to carry out terrorism
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:52.240]  i mean if i was planning secretly to have members of our crew go point guns
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:56.240]  at people and set up checkpoints i should be wiretapped i should be
[2:29:56.240 --> 2:30:01.280]  swat teamed i should go to jail for conspiracy you know to to engage in in
[2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:05.680]  acts kidnapping people commandeering menacing i mean i mean it's horrible
[2:30:05.680 --> 2:30:09.600]  mafia behavior i wouldn't do that i'm not a you know i'm not humongous from the
[2:30:09.600 --> 2:30:15.600]  road warrior this is going on i've seen this with my eyeballs
[2:30:15.600 --> 2:30:18.560]  i have them come and say we're going to kill you once we take over
[2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:21.760]  and the police literally are running around with their tail between their
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:25.360]  legs because the leadership doesn't support them
[2:30:25.360 --> 2:30:28.080]  millie and now you've got all this incredible footage of them saying we're
[2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:31.200]  going to come into your homes we're going to attack you with hammers
[2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:34.320]  i mean it's and people say oh it's a bunch of little girls
[2:30:34.320 --> 2:30:38.000]  that's what's so dangerous about it this what they did in china
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  people don't realize that the psychology of a hundred little girls coming to
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.480]  burn down your house and then when you shoot them
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:48.160]  you kill little girls this is like hezbollah using little kids
[2:30:48.160 --> 2:30:52.160]  with explosive vest and and antifa and others and blm are now using small
[2:30:52.160 --> 2:30:57.440]  children as human shields these are terrorist tactics
[2:30:57.440 --> 2:31:02.080]  exactly they capture the teenage girls so that they can capture the teenage boys
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:06.080]  because they know how influenceable little boys are and teenage boys are
[2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:08.880]  and that they'll go out and try to impress these girls
[2:31:08.880 --> 2:31:13.600]  and how naive the youth are and this is terrorism alex when we saw that they
[2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:16.720]  were talking about marching into the homes of
[2:31:16.720 --> 2:31:20.400]  prominent politicians republicans conservatives we
[2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:23.680]  immediately understood that this was a terrorist threat
[2:31:23.680 --> 2:31:28.000]  and we sent it off to the doj so we're giving all this information over to the
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:31.280]  doj anything we can to help them in their
[2:31:31.280 --> 2:31:34.320]  investigations into antifa and these terrorist
[2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:38.000]  cells inside the united states you know it's another interesting thing though
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:41.920]  that trump has been talking about wanting to delay
[2:31:41.920 --> 2:31:45.920]  the 2020 election well you think about it after the
[2:31:45.920 --> 2:31:49.040]  demonstration the experiment that other journalists
[2:31:49.040 --> 2:31:52.240]  carried out where they mailed a bunch of mail-in
[2:31:52.240 --> 2:31:55.120]  voter ballots and to see how many they got back
[2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:58.880]  well they found that after four days there were still 21 percent
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:03.600]  of the ballots missing lost in snail mail which could cause a massive
[2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:07.840]  discrepancy in the election i mean we'll never really know what the
[2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:11.360]  true voting results are if we only do mail-in ballots due to
[2:32:11.360 --> 2:32:15.360]  COVID-19 so it's imperative that we have these voting locations
[2:32:15.360 --> 2:32:20.560]  open well now too late for that right because guess what
[2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:24.400]  these groups like the sunrise movement BLM etc
[2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:27.600]  they're planning to be out the voting locations
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:31.920]  they're talking about it in these zoom conference chats where they're saying
[2:32:31.920 --> 2:32:38.080]  that they want to do exactly what the wide awakes did in the 1860s
[2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:41.200]  well what did they do they police the voting locations
[2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:45.520]  they would reject ballots that they said were not genuine
[2:32:45.520 --> 2:32:49.760]  i mean it's pretty scary it's a scary thought but how many people are going
[2:32:49.760 --> 2:32:54.000]  to be deterred if they know that okay if i go there
[2:32:54.000 --> 2:32:57.040]  and someone stops me and asks me if i'm a trump supporter if i'm wearing a
[2:32:57.040 --> 2:33:00.960]  MAGA hat i'm fine i'm going to be beaten it's going to deter a lot of people
[2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:04.880]  alex so this is election rating election meddling
[2:33:04.880 --> 2:33:09.040]  absolutely it's all meant to lock us down make everything abnormal
[2:33:09.040 --> 2:33:12.240]  activate a revolution call it racial as they're covered but really it's a
[2:33:12.240 --> 2:33:15.600]  revolution against america backed by foreign powers like the chai comms and
[2:33:15.600 --> 2:33:18.320]  big tech i mean millie i just cannot it's one thing to
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:21.440]  know all this is theoretical it's another thing with 95 days after the
[2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:25.440]  election to be living in mega banks and the chai comms and the
[2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:29.280]  richest people on earth that own slave camps like nike and apple
[2:33:29.280 --> 2:33:32.800]  creating a woke movement to blow up people's own life boat
[2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:36.480]  and bring down the freest country in the world i mean it's just the fact that
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:41.520]  they've got this many idiots is shocking to me
[2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:45.840]  well what happened in minneapolis and throughout the country
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:50.240]  after george floyd's death was a 500 buildings burned in minneapolis
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:55.280]  sorry i'm sure you're right 500 buildings burned down in minneapolis
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:59.520]  that was a dry run they have now officially announced their 100 day
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:04.000]  siege so i don't even know what's going to happen now at this point alex
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:07.120]  well i know this i don't want to kill anybody
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:11.040]  um i don't need to put that on my belt i'm just
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:14.720]  empty for anybody comes to my house with a gun or or any type of fiery object
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:18.400]  and threatens my family they're dead but the problem is these methods scum that
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:22.080]  they've hired are so stupid they don't care and i predict a lot of them are
[2:34:22.080 --> 2:34:26.800]  going to get killed millie yes a lot of them probably will
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:30.560]  but i think that they they're so brainwashed uh i mean
[2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:33.920]  they're willing to die for yeah they think they're captain america
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:37.040]  they think they're captain america fighting fighting hitler
[2:34:37.040 --> 2:34:40.320]  when they literally work for the dude that helped hitler
[2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:43.840]  there ain't many nazi collaborators still left they work for the biggest
[2:34:43.840 --> 2:34:46.800]  evilest one around
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:50.480]  you know it's been scientifically proven that the youth their brains are not
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:53.600]  developed enough to be able to make good sound judgments i mean that's
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:57.360]  typically why we have ages of consent so that's why they're
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:00.240]  going after the young people because young people would be so
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:04.800]  impulsive or lacking judgment to go and you know beat some old person with a
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:08.640]  MAGA hat on or burn someone's house down saying it's a legitimate form of
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:11.920]  protest that's why they're praying on the youth
[2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:15.760]  is because they're influenceable i agree but you know uh i watch though like the
[2:35:15.760 --> 2:35:19.040]  video they just showed her that bigger redhead god you know like he is body
[2:35:19.040 --> 2:35:23.280]  languages he's in charge the cops he's the guy managing a bunch of dumb kids
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:25.920]  there are a lot of people who think they've chosen the winning team
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:29.200]  they think they've chosen the globalist they know it's evil they want the power
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:34.240]  they're bad people the people managing this are the worst people on the planet
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:38.240]  the democrats think that they're manipulating and using the youth
[2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:42.160]  the youth know this the youth are planning to manipulate the democrats
[2:35:42.160 --> 2:35:46.000]  because once the youth gain power you think biden wins that they already
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.960]  have plans to embed themselves in his campaign
[2:35:48.960 --> 2:35:52.480]  and you know extort him and manipulate him to do their bidding
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:56.160]  i mean this group is going to try to take over
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:36:03.120]  and that's what is the communist factions literally just battling for control
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:06.960]  yeah they want to destroy america that's what they're trying to battle control
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:11.040]  over and anyone that stands in their way they are not afraid to tear them down
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:14.640]  burn them down smash them down well the good news is when they show up at
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:17.120]  these different suburbs they're waiting for people
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:20.080]  that have firearms and they're and they're getting stopped in their tracks and

[2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:01.440]  and we need to be praying for president trump praying for america praying for a
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:06.000]  great awakening worldwide and we need to all be very very active
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:10.320]  so despite them trying to shut us down and trying to censor us despite them
[2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:14.320]  trying to blockade our information the globalist
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:17.520]  have failed to a great extent in force still here in some ways more powerful
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:21.360]  than ever but we it's not about in force it's about all of us you've got
[2:42:21.360 --> 2:42:24.480]  to share the live links you've got to share the different articles and videos
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:27.760]  whatever you think is most informative to friends and family and neighbors and
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:34.000]  random people every day every hour human activity can override them and
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:36.960]  people are very hungry for the truth right now
[2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:42.320]  that's why they're trying to censor us i want to play a few more of these clips
[2:42:42.320 --> 2:42:46.560]  millie weaver was talking about these we already showed the sunshine
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:49.360]  sunrise leaders and then one of these big sorrow
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:53.600]  scripts with middle school high school and college girls mainly being
[2:42:53.600 --> 2:42:56.720]  brainwashed but let's play clip number two and
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:43:00.000]  number three sunrise movement and they have on the screen here talking about
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:03.600]  using hammers to beat people in the head and also the all-seeing i
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:06.000]  instagram 30 second let's play number clip number two and number three here
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:21.040]  they are
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:25.280]  again this is mainly tax but they tell you we try to be nice but now
[2:43:25.280 --> 2:43:27.600]  we're coming with hammers to your house you're not gonna be able to sleep we're
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:30.320]  gonna haunt you
[2:43:30.320 --> 2:43:38.000]  we are awake no justice no sleep
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:41.200]  they're all paid to do this
[2:43:44.400 --> 2:43:48.240]  160 year old tactic wide awake
[2:43:48.720 --> 2:43:50.880]  look at these hammers to beat people in the head
[2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:54.400]  they're there with their hammers
[2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:57.360]  they're pots and pans
[2:43:57.360 --> 2:44:01.520]  by the way the imf and world bank came out in 2002
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:04.720]  documents got leaked the bbc and greg pal especially they were still half
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:08.240]  decent and the imf will fund the
[2:44:08.240 --> 2:44:11.200]  communists to riot and protest to bring down a society
[2:44:11.200 --> 2:44:15.120]  so they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:20.400]  let's play their clip of the all-seeing eye play that clip
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:26.320]  yeah so there it is on screen for you millie again this is just one part of
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:29.200]  this but this is a big organization with massive
[2:44:29.200 --> 2:44:32.560]  this is a big organization with massive funding
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:36.320]  and we need as a society to be aware of what's
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:39.760]  what's going on and what's happening millie we were skype was crystal clear
[2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:43.120]  today but sometimes that goes along with her skype
[2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:47.040]  dropping so her skype dropped again i do want to have her be able to finish
[2:44:47.040 --> 2:44:51.200]  up what she had to say but since she mentioned this uh let's get to the clip
[2:44:51.200 --> 2:44:55.680]  of local news experiment in mail-in voting
[2:44:55.680 --> 2:44:59.440]  ends in disaster and this is exactly what president
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:05.120]  trump was talking about here it is if you know how to mail a letter
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:08.080]  you already know how to mail in your vote
[2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:13.760]  thank you very much but how long might it take for that vote to actually
[2:45:13.760 --> 2:45:17.520]  arrive and be counted have a good afternoon we
[2:45:17.520 --> 2:45:20.480]  decided to test it sending a hundred mock ballots
[2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:24.640]  simulating a hundred voters from locations all across philadelphia
[2:45:24.640 --> 2:45:28.720]  to a p o box we set up to represent a local election office
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:32.960]  a couple days later we mailed a hundred more using the same size envelopes
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:37.360]  and the same class of mail as real ballots here to approximate the weight
[2:45:37.360 --> 2:45:43.280]  we even folded mock votes into every one in the following week we checked our
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:47.280]  p o box for the results mail pickup notices more when we went to
[2:45:47.280 --> 2:45:50.320]  collect everything though
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:56.080]  nothing most of our votes seem to be lost that's all i had to write down but
[2:45:56.080 --> 2:45:59.840]  that's not sure you're totally sure i'm leaving you on this one
[2:45:59.840 --> 2:46:03.920]  okay take care we had to ask for a manager
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:07.200]  we're trying to do something about mailing ballots and explain ourselves
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:11.440]  before someone finally found our votes
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:16.560]  okay thank you one two we soon discovered another problem
[2:46:16.560 --> 2:46:20.240]  missorted mail two pieces of it we got a birthday card
[2:46:20.240 --> 2:46:25.840]  from mike to ronnie have a sweet b day get it there's a b on top when the
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:30.480]  birthday greetings ended 12 13 we found a bigger issue
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:34.880]  21 percent of our votes hadn't materialized after four days
[2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:39.520]  and the batch we'd mailed a week prior some of those were missing two
[2:46:39.520 --> 2:46:45.280]  so of our 100 ballots 97 arrived which sounds pretty good
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:49.040]  unless you consider the fact that that means three people who tried to vote by
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:53.360]  mail in our mock election were in fact disenfranchised by mail
[2:46:53.360 --> 2:46:57.520]  in a close election three percent could be pivotal especially in what's
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:47:00.080]  expected to be a record year they're going to be stuffed in the
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:03.120]  daylights out of it somewhere between probably 80
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:06.880]  and 100 million voters receiving their ballot that way
[2:47:06.880 --> 2:47:10.720]  the postal service says voters should mail their return ballots at least one
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:15.040]  week prior to the duty all because the un says of all states still allow voters
[2:47:15.040 --> 2:47:18.800]  to request ballots less than a week before the election
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:22.160]  so you can forgive the public for being a tad confused
[2:47:22.160 --> 2:47:24.880]  how long do you think the post office recommends
[2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:28.720]  about three days two to three days they're saying at least a week
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:31.280]  a week they're saying at least a week for your vote
[2:47:31.280 --> 2:47:34.320]  i just don't trust them out that's true yeah no
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:37.280]  because they're going to remove your ballot and change the vote with your name
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:40.880]  on it especially during covid give them ample time to fill it for her
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:45.440]  i don't trust it why not i don't know i'm scared that it might get lost in the
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:49.360]  know i don't trust dr gates my vote is submitted
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:53.200]  like i see that it's submitted that it actually counts so i need a couple cbs
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:56.480]  news new york so there you go we got mentally
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:47:58.640]  back let me play this clip since i mentioned that we'll go back to her to
[2:47:58.640 --> 2:48:01.600]  finish up this video is at man dot video
[2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:05.440]  google admits us doctors don't have free speech because of you and directives
[2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:08.560]  he says we follow the cdc and nih sundar bachai
[2:48:08.560 --> 2:48:12.000]  which gets its orders from the united nations
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:15.360]  so oh we can't have doctors have a press conference that's got to be banned off
[2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:19.520]  google youtube and twitter and facebook
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:22.320]  because the un says hydroxychloric one isn't good
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:26.560]  off a fake study that bill gates paid for that was withdrawn
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:30.560]  because of fraud but even if the doctors were lying they have a right to a press
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:34.160]  conference you should be up there who says they're lying i mean these are
[2:48:34.160 --> 2:48:38.240]  criminals folks so now oh we're not censoring oh but we can't let doctors
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:41.360]  have a press conference with congressman
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:44.720]  oh the president he's not allowed to tweet either we censored him because the
[2:48:44.720 --> 2:48:49.040]  un said we're under un control
[2:48:49.040 --> 2:48:53.040]  america needs to wake up and say no to all of this the rioting all of it is a
[2:48:53.040 --> 2:48:56.880]  unoperation here's sundar bachai in congress yesterday
[2:48:56.880 --> 2:49:01.600]  mr bachai there there are rioting groups that are going unchecked with the
[2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:05.360]  posting of what i would contend is very violent
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:08.720]  video yet yesterday i was sent a youtube video
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:11.920]  about doctors discussing hydrochloroquine
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:16.880]  and discussing the not dangers of children returning to school
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:20.240]  and when i clicked on the link it was taken down and then i was sent a
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:23.600]  different link on youtube and it was taken down i just checked again just to
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:27.520]  make sure and it says that this video has been removed for violating youtube's
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:33.120]  community guidelines how can doctors giving their opinion on a drug that
[2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:36.080]  they think is effective for the treatment of covet 19
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:40.080]  and doctors who think it's appropriate for children to return back to school
[2:49:40.080 --> 2:49:45.360]  violate youtube's community guidelines when all of these videos of violence is
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:51.760]  all posted on youtube uh congressman we we believe in freedom of
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:55.520]  expression and there is a lot of debate on youtube about
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:49:59.440]  effective ways to deal with covet we allow robust debate
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:03.200]  but in the area during a pandemic uh we
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:08.080]  look to local health authorities in the u.s it would be cdc
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:12.160]  guidelines around medical misinformation in a matter way which could
[2:50:12.160 --> 2:50:16.240]  cause he said local because he knows about you and and so for example
[2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:21.280]  if there is a the aspects of a video and if it explicitly explicitly states
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:26.160]  something could be approved and cure and that doesn't meet cdc guidelines
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:29.920]  you know we would we would see a free expression of speech and you have these
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:34.960]  doctors who are giving their opinion as doctors and i don't understand why
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:39.360]  youtube and therefore google thinks it's appropriate to silence physicians
[2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:42.320]  and their opinion of what can help and cure people
[2:50:42.320 --> 2:50:48.800]  with covet 19 i mean folks these globalists have gone so far down
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:50.960]  the rat hole with our freedoms and we just sit here and put up and we'll come
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:53.040]  back and finish it with millie weaver what do you think's about something

[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:28.400]  whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory
[2:51:28.400 --> 2:51:32.880]  or not the globalist controllers do and they constantly write about and talk
[2:51:32.880 --> 2:51:37.920]  about how they want to create a global crisis or a group of crises
[2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:41.920]  that force humans to quote evolve in a new better way
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:45.360]  that when you study how they actually want you to evolve you believe in that
[2:51:45.360 --> 2:51:48.480]  it is to stop having children emerge with silicon bodies
[2:51:48.480 --> 2:51:52.320]  and a post-human future talk about psychotic talk about creepy
[2:51:52.320 --> 2:51:56.320]  talk about crazy but they need an event like COVID-19
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:51:59.760]  to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose
[2:51:59.760 --> 2:52:04.400]  over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced inoculations
[2:52:04.400 --> 2:52:08.880]  for the gmo for the 5g and for all the things that they admit will
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:13.360]  end our humanity as we know it that's why this is so evil their whole agenda for
[2:52:13.360 --> 2:52:16.320]  cashless society global government
[2:52:16.320 --> 2:52:20.800]  un control getting us all into debt getting rid of local government

[2:53:34.800 --> 2:53:44.160]  i miss the bar where the beach boys would go
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:50.720]  denises last stop before kocamon i didn't even get to
[2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:53.520]  we hired a statistician to show that they're using all the numbers of people
[2:53:53.520 --> 2:53:56.160]  looked out of the flu other things and said that it's
[2:53:56.160 --> 2:53:59.200]  covid that's a study we paid for big major news
[2:53:59.200 --> 2:54:02.240]  i didn't even cover it maybe i'll cover it tomorrow maybe we'll have an article
[2:54:02.240 --> 2:54:06.400]  on info wars.com on that subject
[2:54:06.400 --> 2:54:11.360]  it's just such a crazy world right now things are so out of control
[2:54:11.360 --> 2:54:14.000]  and you know the media talks about how they want to shut us down as we're
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:17.440]  fake news well but actually what we cover it's it's all
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:20.240]  coming true we're not trying to be false in any way we make mistakes
[2:54:20.240 --> 2:54:24.000]  sometimes milley what's gut level milley weaver
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:27.840]  great journalist out there what do you think's coming in the future what do
[2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:30.240]  you think should happen with trump what do you think should happen with all
[2:54:30.240 --> 2:54:35.120]  these mail-in ballots election fraud what's your female mother's intuition
[2:54:35.120 --> 2:54:38.640]  uh i know your mother go two beautiful children
[2:54:38.640 --> 2:54:42.640]  what do you gut level thinks about to happen in 95 days
[2:54:42.640 --> 2:54:46.720]  well i think that no matter the result of the election
[2:54:46.720 --> 2:54:49.840]  we're going to see civil unrest we're going to see violence
[2:54:49.840 --> 2:54:54.000]  i mean because think about it if biden wins we're going to see
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:58.960]  insanity he's going to be pushing more and more of these globalist policies
[2:54:58.960 --> 2:55:03.200]  he's going to be trying to take away guns look at his draconian gun policies
[2:55:03.200 --> 2:55:07.520]  the policies he has are going to be insane so either way if biden wins i
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:11.920]  predict civil unrest if uh if trump wins there's definitely
[2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:15.440]  going to be civil unrest because the left is not going to stop
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:18.960]  i think that there's going to be so much election fraud
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:22.480]  meddling rigging everything in the election
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:25.520]  what's going to happen is it's going to be contested
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:29.440]  trump's going to contest it and i think that the democrats are going to say
[2:55:29.440 --> 2:55:32.320]  oh he's a dictator he's refusing to leave office
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:36.560]  and they're going to try to have a violent coup a violent overthrow
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:40.160]  um i think that's what we're going to see happen here it seems like they're
[2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:44.240]  setting the stage for that from the news headlines that i've been
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:48.080]  reading and seeing that's what's going to happen
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:54.960]  i totally agree with you how do we change that how do we navigate that
[2:55:54.960 --> 2:55:59.360]  i don't know i mean this is one of those things where it's a
[2:55:59.360 --> 2:56:03.040]  it's a double-edged sword i mean if biden wins
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:06.480]  we're going to be battling the globalist head-on
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:10.400]  they're going to be trying to force us with these vaccinations that have
[2:56:10.400 --> 2:56:14.480]  markers in them they're going to force a universal id on us
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:17.760]  the mark of the beast you're not going to be able to buy things shop go
[2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:20.640]  anywhere without proof that you've been vaccinated
[2:56:20.640 --> 2:56:23.680]  they're going to take away guns they're going to limit free speech they're
[2:56:23.680 --> 2:56:26.560]  going to police the heck out of the internet they're going to have surveillance
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:30.720]  cameras everywhere social credit score systems we're going to be in a tech
[2:56:30.720 --> 2:56:33.200]  that's right they didn't even police anymore because they'll just turn your
[2:56:33.200 --> 2:56:35.760]  phone your money off if you don't do what they say
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:38.960]  they'll have a little special leftist groups that come and burn your house down
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:42.640]  i mean this is such i mean this is we're waking up in a nightmare science fiction
[2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:46.240]  dystopia i mean this is really here it's not coming now what is it like millie
[2:56:46.240 --> 2:56:48.560]  to know this is coming to be awake for 10 years
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:52.320]  working for m4s you know eight years what is it like to now see it all
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:56.480]  actually here well it's frustrating alex because
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:56:59.680]  i always thought okay if you give the truth to the american people they're
[2:56:59.680 --> 2:57:01.680]  all just going to wake up they're going to be
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:05.760]  awakened they'll be enlightened they'll rebel against these globalists and
[2:57:05.760 --> 2:57:08.160]  these people but the sad thing that i'm beginning to
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:11.680]  realize is that some of them are just so brainwashed
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:15.680]  like these culties in the sunrise movement that they are going to be used
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:19.360]  as a weapon against their fellow americans they're going to be working
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:23.200]  against their own you know best interests essentially
[2:57:23.200 --> 2:57:27.440]  attacking their own fellow americans for the bidding of the globalists that
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:31.040]  want to destroy this country not even realizing or knowing it and
[2:57:31.040 --> 2:57:35.040]  we're in such a time period where right is wrong and wrong is right
[2:57:35.040 --> 2:57:39.040]  everyone's so confused there's so many psychological warfare operations ia
[2:57:39.040 --> 2:57:41.520]  operations going on right now on social media
[2:57:41.520 --> 2:57:46.400]  people don't know what to believe you have like a like we saw in the hearings
[2:57:46.400 --> 2:57:49.360]  where you have sundar pichai talking about how
[2:57:49.360 --> 2:57:54.400]  these doctors putting out their opinions they're practicing medical doctors
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:57:56.880]  and they're claiming that you're done you're not
[2:57:56.880 --> 2:58:01.280]  fousy says you're not allowed to fousy said it's the president was shut down
[2:58:01.280 --> 2:58:05.680]  and fousy says that's good at first they came for alex jones
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:09.280]  remember that everyone first they came for alex they called him fake news they
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:12.640]  banned him from everything now they're calling practicing physicians
[2:58:12.640 --> 2:58:17.120]  physicians and doctors fake news they're banning breifart prager university
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:21.520]  granting the president's tweets what more do you need to know that the real
[2:58:21.520 --> 2:58:24.640]  goal is that they're coming after you the american people
[2:58:24.640 --> 2:58:28.880]  and we're just in the way that's right powerful milley weaver thank you so much
[2:58:28.880 --> 2:58:32.160]  millenia milley find her everywhere we'll be right back stay with us have one
[2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:34.240]  more piece of it is the guest house is coming up
[2:58:34.240 --> 2:58:38.160]  reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown
[2:58:38.160 --> 2:58:42.400]  the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes
[2:58:42.400 --> 2:58:45.520]  we've gone over those purposes many times
[2:58:45.520 --> 2:58:49.440]  here on air the casual society the surveillance system
[2:58:49.440 --> 2:58:52.880]  global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:56.480]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[2:58:56.480 --> 2:59:01.680]  obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to
[2:59:01.680 --> 2:59:05.440]  witness automation computers and robots take over
[2:59:05.440 --> 2:59:10.880]  the jobs that people once had by design this isn't like it's some
[2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:14.480]  advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:18.560]  organized globally and it's extremely predatory
[2:59:18.560 --> 2:59:21.920]  and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:25.440]  and regulations the central banks that control it all
[2:59:25.440 --> 2:59:30.400]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power
[2:59:30.400 --> 2:59:44.240]  this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[2:59:44.240 --> 2:59:54.240]  alex jones the cure to fake news coming to you live from austin texas
[2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:59.680]  you know ted newgent is 71 years old and if you know him in person he's got a
[2:59:59.680 --> 3:00:03.200]  very powerful presence and feels like you're with a 45-year-old
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:07.600]  guy in his prime and he's kind of canned in his speeches
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:10.640]  the things he says as he works you know 18 hours a day
[3:00:10.640 --> 3:00:13.920]  doesn't work a whole lot worse than i am but i was talking to him
[3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:18.000]  during the break last sunday when he was on
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:21.440]  and he said alex you just got to work as hard as you can now because
[3:00:21.440 --> 3:00:24.400]  this is everything they've been planning for generations to take down the
[3:00:24.400 --> 3:00:27.200]  republic for part of their larger plan and
[3:00:27.200 --> 3:00:29.680]  i don't think it's going to go well for him but it's going to be rough so just
[3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:32.960]  you need to let everybody know this is once in a lifetime what's what's going
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:36.240]  down and everything that we've stand for is now
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:39.040]  about to be tested
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:45.840]  and that's really what's going on here
[3:00:46.640 --> 3:00:49.200]  you know i already told the crew i said i want to come in tonight seven to nine
[3:00:49.200 --> 3:00:51.520]  to a special commercial free live show but i don't think i'm going to do it i'm
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:56.720]  too tired i'm 46 folks i got a lot of energy
[3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:00.160]  but the reason i'm so tired is i did all this preparation i didn't cover five
[3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:03.600]  percent of it i just know how they're lying i know
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:09.360]  their plan and it's so horrible and what's exhausting is
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:13.200]  we know they're evil we know they're psychotic we know it's bad
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:17.120]  we know it's going to get worse and then i see all these idiots buying into it
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:20.720]  who have no idea how much trouble they're in because i mean look i've been
[3:01:20.720 --> 3:01:24.880]  living with the devil for a long time living close to this thing
[3:01:24.880 --> 3:01:28.240]  and and i guess i never really figured it out when i was a kid but i was always
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:32.000]  close to it my family been involved a bunch of stuff
[3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:34.320]  and
[3:01:36.160 --> 3:01:40.400]  but now to be here in the zeitgeist and to be right down to the wire
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:44.240]  and and and and to have real evil about to take over
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:48.320]  i mean we're talking soviet level red terror in america i mean we're talking
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:51.360]  tens of millions towards the death death camps ever i mean
[3:01:51.360 --> 3:01:55.200]  civil war death of the streets i mean starvation nuclear reactors melting down
[3:01:55.200 --> 3:02:00.560]  i mean it's we are entering hell itself right now
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:04.480]  because we gave up on god we said god we don't need you just go ahead and you
[3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:07.280]  know get out of here
[3:02:12.880 --> 3:02:16.880]  and then i see the hit pieces on cnn and msnbc and abc news and
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:21.840]  front line pbs and it doesn't hurt me that they're lying about me it hurts me
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:26.240]  that there's so many bad people that are so good at lying
[3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:29.840]  i mean i watched this hour-long thing we'll go to our guest who's taking over
[3:02:29.840 --> 3:02:32.560]  jedi in a moment
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:36.160]  and i sat there and i watched the other night when it came on all the pbs
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:39.440]  stations which still has a big audience
[3:02:39.440 --> 3:02:43.120]  and i watched how they took photos of me and even photo shopped them
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:47.440]  to make me look weird you kind of make people unsettled and the way they edited
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:51.440]  sentences together and the way they lied about this but told the truth about that
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:55.840]  and i was just watching it and realizing what a bunch of followers these people
[3:02:55.840 --> 3:03:00.160]  are but what is the spider who's the conductor
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:02.640]  that they're following the orders from that's really what we should be
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:06.800]  discussing but everything in the show even though
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:10.480]  they would twist it would still tell the truth because the truth is still there
[3:03:10.480 --> 3:03:14.080]  like jones claims he's being censored
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:17.920]  jones claims there's a movement to take him off air they admit that's their
[3:03:17.920 --> 3:03:20.640]  movement and then they misrepresent who i am and talk
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:23.120]  about sandy hook that i hardly ever even talked about
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:27.120]  the internet questioned it you have ever write to and people that are not in
[3:03:27.120 --> 3:03:30.720]  hiding one day or now in hiding oh because of me and i i'm sending
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:34.480]  white supremacist after him none of that's even true
[3:03:34.480 --> 3:03:38.000]  and you watch it and you see it people living off my name
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:42.480]  collecting money off my name and then saying i'm doing it off their name
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:46.480]  it actually makes me just feel sorry for them
[3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:51.760]  and how they took the openness and freedom of our society and pissed all
[3:03:51.760 --> 3:03:54.960]  over it and now all that prosperity and
[3:03:54.960 --> 3:03:58.720]  all the the blessings and the hedge of protection
[3:03:58.720 --> 3:04:03.120]  is now being removed so here's a few minutes
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:07.040]  from the piece that we haven't played i haven't played most of it
[3:04:07.040 --> 3:04:11.200]  where they're like look he's a kook he claims he's being censored
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:14.880]  when they are censoring me and then they show this one scene in the press
[3:04:14.880 --> 3:04:18.640]  conference where the cop comes over says i want to talk to you for a moment
[3:04:18.640 --> 3:04:22.640]  he just wanted to say you're not going to go inside and yell at the senators are
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:25.280]  you and i said no he said fine i was gone 30 seconds
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:28.880]  they make it look like i got arrested for my speech and they go on to say that's
[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:32.400]  a good thing on the show so there's all these photos that
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:35.200]  always pushing me whenever the communists attacked me at the rnc
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:38.560]  four years ago in july four years ago
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:43.280]  four years ago now and
[3:04:44.240 --> 3:04:46.960]  the state police grabbed me and took me out of the crowd and they put on the
[3:04:46.960 --> 3:04:50.720]  news that i was arrested said look they are i mean they don't care folks
[3:04:50.720 --> 3:04:54.720]  it's next level line so so you'll see this in this little
[3:04:54.720 --> 3:04:58.640]  piece just every bit of it you spend an hour on each minute
[3:04:58.640 --> 3:05:02.640]  because this is the fan fiction that that they produced for the people that
[3:05:02.640 --> 3:05:06.480]  watch uh and listen to npr here it is brought to you by the ford foundation
[3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:10.320]  here it is there was a backlash there was a backlash
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:14.480]  where people started to really try to examine this person
[3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:18.880]  they started to review internally you know are we monetizing this guy are we
[3:05:18.880 --> 3:05:22.800]  supporting the horrible things that he's doing
[3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:27.520]  jones tried to portray it as a conspiracy by the deep state and globalists
[3:05:27.520 --> 3:05:30.880]  i am here because there is a concerted effort
[3:05:30.880 --> 3:05:34.080]  by the democratic party and multinational corporations in big tech
[3:05:34.080 --> 3:05:38.320]  to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices that's why i've
[3:05:38.320 --> 3:05:42.480]  been targeted so i can't have a press conference as
[3:05:42.480 --> 3:05:46.240]  you can see in america cannot face my users the tech giants were
[3:05:46.240 --> 3:05:50.000]  incredibly slow to respond to what mr jones was doing
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:54.080]  they were more than happy to allow mr jones
[3:05:54.080 --> 3:05:57.600]  to make money for their platforms causing mayhem and hysteria
[3:05:57.600 --> 3:06:03.680]  they were absolutely happy to do it it's called section 230
[3:06:03.680 --> 3:06:06.960]  that they're not publishers they let activists say go kill people at their
[3:06:06.960 --> 3:06:09.600]  houses again and these are all they're only telling the
[3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:12.160]  show that these are the lawyers and the deep state operatives
[3:06:12.160 --> 3:06:16.640]  that are literally saying they want to take us off air and stop our free speech
[3:06:16.640 --> 3:06:19.680]  well they don't care about slave labor in china or death camps or
[3:06:19.680 --> 3:06:23.440]  three million christians and muslims in in death camps no no no it's all
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:27.840]  alex jones he's a bad guy and he claims
[3:06:27.840 --> 3:06:31.840]  when they in the senate hearings the senators say we want jones off the air
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:36.400]  senator blumenthal and murphy and then oh jones claims there's a conspiracy
[3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:40.800]  insulting your intelligence let's continue for them and some of it became
[3:06:40.800 --> 3:06:44.400]  this lawsuit some of it became mr jones's
[3:06:44.400 --> 3:06:50.080]  conduct those around jones saw something else
[3:06:50.080 --> 3:06:54.560]  revenge from the left for jones's alliance with trump
[3:06:54.560 --> 3:06:59.520]  my own view is that it has the fingerprints of an organized attack
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:03.440]  within two years of trump's election he faces an onslaught of lawsuits
[3:07:03.440 --> 3:07:07.440]  from all across the country like the kind he had never faced before
[3:07:07.440 --> 3:07:11.760]  and he is completely removed from almost every social media platform
[3:07:11.760 --> 3:07:16.400]  and his voice is censored or silenced it's an unprecedented attack on any
[3:07:16.400 --> 3:07:23.440]  individual that i've ever witnessed
[3:07:23.440 --> 3:07:29.040]  by 2020 alex jones was exploiting another national tragedy
[3:07:29.040 --> 3:07:32.320]  the coronavirus pandemic
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:36.720]  to create the fear and allow the nation to never be open
[3:07:36.720 --> 3:07:44.960]  this is the chai kong for those bio-limits and to shut down our economy
[3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:50.960]  fear economic collapse partisan division
[3:07:50.960 --> 3:08:03.520]  and he was still in lockstep with the president later the democratic party the
[3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:10.960]  liberals are cheering this virus now the democrats are politicizing the
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:15.840]  coronavirus i will stop there lockstep with reality
[3:08:15.840 --> 3:08:18.800]  earlier in the film they go look jones said obama was planning executive order
[3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:22.480]  cartel guns and trump said the same thing it was in the news
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:26.480]  so trump's mentioning the same top story i am and look trump has listened to me
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:28.640]  some but the point is the truth the truth
[3:08:28.640 --> 3:08:33.600]  almost all that show is a lie and they know it's a lie
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:37.840]  all right got a special guest toast about to take over j dire he's got a lot
[3:08:37.840 --> 3:08:42.240]  to cover claus schwaab head of the deboss his book on the great reset that's
[3:08:42.240 --> 3:08:45.360]  what this is is a world depression their engineering they say it's good we're
[3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:49.520]  going to have a global depression that will cut the carbon footprint
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:52.720]  you just saw them saying jones is crazy when he says the lockdown's
[3:08:52.720 --> 3:08:56.480]  going to cause a depression okay well don't have to hold your breath it's here
[3:08:56.480 --> 3:09:00.640]  folks i mean again they have to take something totally normal and true
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:04.400]  and something totally authentic teleprompter free
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:08.160]  and then they say it's a manufactured setup by me like everything j dire is
[3:09:08.160 --> 3:09:10.400]  about to say is all pre-programmed by somebody else
[3:09:10.400 --> 3:09:13.680]  you know uh the uh really what are those people saying
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:16.640]  somewhere right when republicans really always claims funding me
[3:09:16.640 --> 3:09:20.160]  which it's not the whatever their names are i always forget the coke brothers
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:23.360]  we got one set from them got it from the list for supporting us
[3:09:23.360 --> 3:09:26.960]  and revolution flash mom's brain chips bill gates backing climate
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:30.480]  scientists lobbying for large-scale geoengineering that's weather control
[3:09:30.480 --> 3:09:33.760]  it's all coming up stay with us there are a lot of reasons to get an alex
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:38.720]  jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political
[3:09:38.720 --> 3:09:42.720]  events you can trigger live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:46.720]  great conversation starter at any costume party or
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:51.200]  at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks goes
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:54.000]  absolutely nothing to protect you from covid-19 or anything else
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:57.120]  it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:10:00.160]  inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:04.000]  announce it it's an act of submission it's an act of like putting a burqa on
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:07.680]  your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then
[3:10:07.680 --> 3:10:11.200]  into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say
[3:10:11.200 --> 3:10:15.040]  it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're
[3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:19.440]  wearing and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:22.960]  so they quote spread covid-19 they don't protect from it
[3:10:22.960 --> 3:10:25.920]  so again it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks faces
[3:10:25.920 --> 3:10:29.600]  you buy one for 9.95 you get four more free they're at cost

[3:11:33.120 --> 3:11:54.720]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:11:54.720 --> 3:11:57.760]  welcome back to the alexa jones show on your guest host
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:03.600]  j dire of json alexa.com you know in the last few installments when i was on
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:08.080]  we covered the writings of the elite uh this time we're going to cover a more
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:12.320]  recent book 2018 in the head of davos claus schwaab
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:17.040]  himself wrote a really important book now remember this is pre
[3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:22.240]  covid right so this is 2018 and i think mr claus has given us
[3:12:22.240 --> 3:12:26.320]  quite a few clues and keys to understand what's going on
[3:12:26.320 --> 3:12:29.920]  right now in fact i was pretty blown away looking back
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:35.200]  at this this material given what's happened in the last few months
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:39.280]  because he outlines the entire big perspective
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:42.160]  and that's what we're going to focus on and i'm also going to look at a
[3:12:42.160 --> 3:12:46.400]  document or two from a while back one from 2007 that dealt with
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:50.320]  flash mobs and revolution a white paper then we're going to look back at the
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:54.800]  philosophy of the un back from 1946 the governing
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:58.240]  philosophy of the united nations and the reason that matters is that
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:01.440]  as claus will tell us and as we all know now from
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:05.600]  what we've seen out of the world health authority
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:09.360]  we are now supposed to submit to whatever the un says right across the
[3:13:09.360 --> 3:13:12.960]  board we were just told in the bbc what two
[3:13:12.960 --> 3:13:17.520]  days ago in the technology section that there will be
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:23.920]  implantable printed ink chips or tattoos it may in fact deal with rna
[3:13:23.920 --> 3:13:28.240]  and dna it may manipulate our rna and dna it's all
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:31.760]  funded by bill and melinda gays foundation everything that by the way i
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:35.440]  made videos about this about three months ago talking about it was all on the
[3:13:35.440 --> 3:13:39.200]  gavi website it was all publicly on the website you go look at it i put it in
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:43.440]  my videos where i was dressed up like marina abramovich
[3:13:43.440 --> 3:13:46.800]  you're sort of making fun of her in a satire video i did
[3:13:46.800 --> 3:13:50.880]  and in that video i put the images of the gavi website where they talked about
[3:13:50.880 --> 3:13:54.320]  this but i had multiple people months after that
[3:13:54.320 --> 3:13:58.640]  attacking oh this is crazy this is a crazy conspiracy oh you think the book
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:03.680]  revelations is going to come true oh he's crazy right
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:07.280]  but guess what within 25 pages of claus's book
[3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:11.200]  in 2018 he said all of what we're seeing now
[3:14:11.200 --> 3:14:15.600]  would occur that's the amazing thing here right you can look at davos world
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:18.320]  economic forum kind of like a more liberal public
[3:14:18.320 --> 3:14:23.360]  builder bird basically right and so if we want to understand what
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:27.840]  thereafter we have to think about the recent past
[3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:32.080]  the the past revolutions and here we're talking about economic
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:35.040]  social revolutions we're talking about political revolutions we're talking
[3:14:35.040 --> 3:14:39.280]  about the you know the the machine revolution right when
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:43.040]  the luddites tried to bust all the machines and then textile you know
[3:14:43.040 --> 3:14:46.640]  industry was revolutionized he counts that as the first revolution
[3:14:46.640 --> 3:14:50.800]  right as then if you work your way up the fourth revolution that claus is
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:14:54.160]  talking about is what they're trying to bring in now
[3:14:54.160 --> 3:14:57.520]  which is the integration of all areas of life
[3:14:57.520 --> 3:15:01.360]  including the biosphere including humans
[3:15:01.360 --> 3:15:06.800]  biometrics all of this stuff under one umbrella of a new system and he
[3:15:06.800 --> 3:15:10.080]  outlines all of this in the book but first of all he starts out with a
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:13.840]  really curious statement that now that we're in a global society he says
[3:15:13.840 --> 3:15:17.040]  we suddenly have a global responsibility
[3:15:17.040 --> 3:15:20.400]  meaning that there's no longer this idea of
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:26.000]  individual nation states individuals it's all conditioned now by this
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:29.920]  collective and this fourth revolution which did build on previous
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:35.040]  revolutions he says will initiate a whole new way of being
[3:15:35.040 --> 3:15:39.920]  and he argues about this kind of rocket style
[3:15:39.920 --> 3:15:43.840]  increase in technological production in
[3:15:43.840 --> 3:15:47.280]  advances that are occurring faster than we can even keep up with and he says
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:51.600]  that we can predicate we can we can assume that from that
[3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:55.200]  we're necessarily then going to have to have a global government to
[3:15:55.200 --> 3:15:58.640]  control all of this out of control technology
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:01.920]  and we're going to have to have a new ethics that's the craziest part of this
[3:16:01.920 --> 3:16:06.960]  so this book it is a lot of about future predictions but what really
[3:16:06.960 --> 3:16:12.160]  surprised me with claus's work was he wants to instill a new ethic
[3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:15.680]  he says we can't use the older enlightenment idea of neutral ethics
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:19.280]  anymore neutral philosophy neutral science
[3:16:19.280 --> 3:16:22.480]  there's no neutrality now ha ha ha we tricked you we told you there was
[3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:25.360]  neutrality there's not really neutrality
[3:16:25.360 --> 3:16:29.520]  actually we're going to give you the new ethic he says
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:32.160]  and he says the first thing that we're going to learn in this new ethic of the
[3:16:32.160 --> 3:16:35.360]  fourth industrial revolution which is transhumanism
[3:16:35.360 --> 3:16:40.160]  he says is that everything will have to be fairly redistributed
[3:16:40.160 --> 3:16:44.720]  everything will be fairly redistributed
[3:16:44.720 --> 3:16:49.200]  in other words kind of what marx said right redistribution
[3:16:49.200 --> 3:16:52.480]  not just of wealth redistribution of everything
[3:16:52.480 --> 3:16:56.480]  so all of life will be kind of commodified
[3:16:56.480 --> 3:17:02.640]  and quantified and equalized that's the key here is the radical equalization
[3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:08.080]  of all things including people cultures male female
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:10.800]  everything that you could think of in society being radically
[3:17:10.800 --> 3:17:14.800]  equalized he says all of life will change and everything will come under
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:19.760]  this new systems analysis development that will
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:23.440]  that will instill a new sense of empowerment
[3:17:23.440 --> 3:17:28.560]  right and equalization he says this book is not written for the average
[3:17:28.560 --> 3:17:30.960]  person this is the book written for leaders
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:35.600]  so what you're getting from me is what the elite themselves write to one another
[3:17:35.600 --> 3:17:38.720]  right claus just trusts that nobody's going to read his book he trusts that
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:41.840]  none of the people out there you know joe six-pack they're not going to read
[3:17:41.840 --> 3:17:46.080]  claus's book they're just going to watch tv watch netflix whatever
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:50.240]  and so claus can openly write his books as we've seen with the 50 other plus
[3:17:50.240 --> 3:17:53.280]  globalist elite books they can just write these books
[3:17:53.280 --> 3:18:00.240]  as if you don't care this new ecosystem he says will have a value
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:05.280]  embedded in every area of our life that the tech elite will decide and get this
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:09.440]  page 20 to 21 he's not even 22 pages into his book
[3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:16.160]  and he says the microchips will become a part of us
[3:18:16.160 --> 3:18:20.480]  literally openly saying you will have a microchip it will be part of you
[3:18:20.480 --> 3:18:25.920]  you will become a robot of size right the robots are going to take over
[3:18:25.920 --> 3:18:30.160]  he says this will unfortunately put a lot of people out of jobs right i mean
[3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:32.560]  you're not going to have check out people you're not going to have any of that
[3:18:32.560 --> 3:18:35.280]  stuff that you're already seeing you know the big box stores
[3:18:35.280 --> 3:18:39.840]  replace but it doesn't stop there right you're not just going to get
[3:18:39.840 --> 3:18:45.920]  your nasty gmo hamburger from a robot when you go to mcdonald's
[3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:49.440]  it doesn't stop there you're not going to have factory jobs
[3:18:49.440 --> 3:18:52.720]  the factory jobs are going to go away so they're going to be robots
[3:18:52.720 --> 3:18:56.560]  you're not going to be driving for amazon right you're not going to be a truck
[3:18:56.560 --> 3:18:59.680]  driver you're not going to be a ups driver drivers
[3:18:59.680 --> 3:19:04.560]  are going away and in fact in the ultimate scheme
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:08.960]  you won't have a car cars are going away now you say wait a minute that's
[3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:11.200]  crazy how are you going to get rid of cars i mean
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:14.480]  everything is structured in the system that we have i mean
[3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:18.640]  transportation is is crucial to you know the economy it's
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:20.720]  the getting products to where they need to go
[3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:25.200]  right but that's the point is that the existing system
[3:19:25.200 --> 3:19:31.440]  has to go that is the great reset that's what claus is talking about
[3:19:31.440 --> 3:19:36.000]  what is the great reset the idea here is that man has become
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:39.440]  a kind of virus on the earth right so he has to be not just
[3:19:39.440 --> 3:19:43.120]  completely reduced but ultimately sort of transformed into something beyond
[3:19:43.120 --> 3:19:46.160]  what he is it's a kind of a inversion of the gospel you
[3:19:46.160 --> 3:19:49.440]  could think of it like this right like think about the garden of
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:52.480]  eaten right satan says you can be your own god
[3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:56.560]  right and what are the tech elites saying oh we're going to promise you
[3:19:56.560 --> 3:19:59.840]  that you can become your own god claus will literally talk about that he'll
[3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:04.000]  talk about it as the promethean principle in this very book
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:07.840]  he says that the economy of the future will be green
[3:20:07.840 --> 3:20:14.240]  clean and will completely cut down co2s he says the goal is zero now i'm
[3:20:14.240 --> 3:20:18.320]  going to tell you why that matters what what zero co2s actually mean
[3:20:18.320 --> 3:20:21.280]  right uh we're the carbon based life form that
[3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:24.800]  means zero humans right zero human population growth is actually what he's
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:30.800]  talking about but i'll get into that when we come back in the next segment
[3:20:30.800 --> 3:20:36.160]  you can't make this stuff up a consortium of the unwho the bill of
[3:20:36.160 --> 3:20:40.480]  melinda gates foundation the national institutes of health and of course the
[3:20:40.480 --> 3:20:44.640]  clinton global initiative headed up by chelsea clinton on the board
[3:20:44.640 --> 3:20:47.840]  are in control with apple and google with a

[3:20:52.240 --> 3:20:55.760]  everywhere you go they claim for covet but of course it's really the
[3:20:55.760 --> 3:20:59.520]  chinese communist social score rollout these people
[3:20:59.520 --> 3:21:04.000]  are sick filthy criminals and they want total control over society
[3:21:04.000 --> 3:21:07.600]  with the official global id system that's why it's called
[3:21:07.600 --> 3:21:10.640]  the clinton global initiative but you can fight back

[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:07.600]  claus and what claus was saying and i want to pause for a second with claus
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:11.280]  because as i was reading his book he reminded me of that
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:17.120]  2007 guardian article that i think alex reported on at the time
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:21.280]  and it was a british ministry of defense white paper that looked forward to the
[3:24:21.280 --> 3:24:24.320]  future right so we're going to see that what claus was talking about a couple
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:28.080]  years ago was the same thing being talked about in 2007
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:30.960]  and by extension we're going to see all the way back to the 40s
[3:24:30.960 --> 3:24:35.040]  so that uh article set is called revolution flash mobs and brain chips a
[3:24:35.040 --> 3:24:39.040]  grim vision of the future it's the guardian's report on the british
[3:24:39.040 --> 3:24:41.920]  ministry of defense and it says that what we're looking for in the future
[3:24:41.920 --> 3:24:45.760]  in the near future here is implanted microchips
[3:24:45.760 --> 3:24:52.560]  emp weapons and a revolutionary middle class of flash mobs
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:56.880]  well i wonder what that might have a reference to right this is 2007 here we
[3:24:56.880 --> 3:25:00.160]  are 2020 what has been activated
[3:25:00.160 --> 3:25:04.640]  all across america flash mobs and not only that
[3:25:04.640 --> 3:25:08.080]  this british ministry of defense paper predicts that the
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:14.160]  flash mobs would even be mobilized with a philosophy of revived marxism
[3:25:14.160 --> 3:25:18.880]  cultural crazed malice style marxism
[3:25:18.880 --> 3:25:22.560]  and it even notes that these are largely sort of middle class people right
[3:25:22.560 --> 3:25:26.240]  primarily probably white people engineered and
[3:25:26.240 --> 3:25:30.560]  mobilized mainly through their uh you know marxist education that they
[3:25:30.560 --> 3:25:33.680]  received by their marxist professors in the universities
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:36.960]  now at the top of the system it's not run by marxist
[3:25:36.960 --> 3:25:40.960]  okay it's the wealthiest people on the planet that are up there doing that
[3:25:40.960 --> 3:25:45.120]  just look at anthony sutton's book wall street the bullshit revolution
[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:48.640]  wall street and hitler it's the richest people that fund these
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:53.040]  movements hence why when you read claus the world economic forum who attends
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:25:56.480]  davos all these zillionaires all of these
[3:25:56.480 --> 3:25:59.520]  hollywood elites right all these degenerates out of the entertainment
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:02.560]  industry they all go there and they dalliance and they
[3:26:02.560 --> 3:26:06.720]  they dance around and they proclaim i think kevin spacey called himself king
[3:26:06.720 --> 3:26:10.640]  of davos a few years ago right and so they're all partying and having fun
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:12.560]  and talking about what they're going to do and
[3:26:12.560 --> 3:26:16.480]  yeah they seem like oh they're these these liberals these we're marxists we
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:19.440]  care about fighting the elite and they're all zillionaires
[3:26:19.440 --> 3:26:23.840]  come on it's always the same scam and this document even predicted that it
[3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:29.840]  said these flash mobs would be mobilized and engineered by this
[3:26:29.840 --> 3:26:34.720]  kind of revived lower level marxism run by
[3:26:34.720 --> 3:26:40.000]  fortune 100 fortune 500 amazing document 2007 told us everything that we would
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:42.560]  be seeing today it even talks about the
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:46.080]  brain chips as well and it says that the brain chips might even be
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:50.320]  put into people's heads in the section on flash mobs right to mobilize
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:57.840]  brain chips by 2035 and flash mobs literal mobs of like cyborg zombies i
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:01.760]  mean he's the oh that's science fiction and yet it's all written about right
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:05.280]  that was 2007 claus is just echoing all that same
[3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:09.120]  stuff anyway so claus moves on to say in the next
[3:27:09.120 --> 3:27:12.080]  few chapters chapter three and four he says that we're going to have a new
[3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:16.240]  ethic and that ethic is going to be given to you by the united nations it's the
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:19.680]  philosophy of the united nations that will be enforced
[3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:23.120]  he says actually ai will enforce this new ethic and he says we're going to make
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:28.000]  people sign on to a new social covenant
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:32.880]  let's curious language because covenant is biblical language right god make
[3:27:32.880 --> 3:27:36.000]  covenant with israel god makes a covenant with his people
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:39.360]  the new covenant etc so we we know that this is
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:43.440]  intentionally i think biblical language but claus says the covenant is going to
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:46.000]  be the united nations making a new
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:49.120]  earth covenant with you you're going to have a new
[3:27:49.120 --> 3:27:54.960]  collectivist ethic he says where everyone is perceived to be a steward
[3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:59.680]  and not an owner of everything your children
[3:27:59.680 --> 3:28:04.640]  you're a steward of your child that's owned by the global village
[3:28:04.640 --> 3:28:08.480]  if you have a car that's not your car in fact you probably got that through
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:12.000]  some sort of oppression right you didn't get that car because you
[3:28:12.000 --> 3:28:15.840]  built a business or no everybody contributed to you having that car and
[3:28:15.840 --> 3:28:19.440]  so therefore everybody owns your car now this is of course the classic
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:23.920]  collectivist scam that because you know we have a society
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:28.000]  therefore everybody owns or everybody has some claim to
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:32.720]  your children and to your to your wealth to your capital
[3:28:32.720 --> 3:28:38.240]  but now wait a minute who is going to redistribute and decide what's fair
[3:28:38.240 --> 3:28:42.560]  you see that's the thing that that the ground swell marks his mob they never
[3:28:42.560 --> 3:28:45.520]  asked that question or they just assume that you can
[3:28:45.520 --> 3:28:48.560]  you can just sort of throw all that authority off to some international
[3:28:48.560 --> 3:28:53.440]  body oh and it'll be fair as if international bodies
[3:28:53.440 --> 3:28:57.040]  aren't corrupt though you understand that the whole
[3:28:57.040 --> 3:29:02.480]  global system is run by zillionaire con artists the whole system
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:06.560]  is conology that's key to understanding
[3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:10.480]  think about in ron think about what we've been seeing the last six months
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:14.720]  it's run by high high level con men the best con men
[3:29:14.720 --> 3:29:22.480]  you see remember the stories of bill gates
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:27.840]  anyway this new society that's going to come about will be a global democracy
[3:29:27.840 --> 3:29:33.520]  based on rights and fairness and we will have a global centralized body
[3:29:33.520 --> 3:29:38.560]  he says on pages 50 51 that will enforce the fairness and redistribute
[3:29:38.560 --> 3:29:41.600]  the wealth he says we'll have a social gospel
[3:29:41.600 --> 3:29:44.960]  right a liberation theology kind of social gospel that will be preached on
[3:29:44.960 --> 3:29:48.480]  all these fake churches and kind of tied into like new age movement type
[3:29:48.480 --> 3:29:51.040]  stuff and he says maybe even when we get the internet of
[3:29:51.040 --> 3:29:55.440]  things and everything is interconnected we can use that interconnected
[3:29:55.440 --> 3:29:59.600]  system to track and trace everything this is the key
[3:29:59.600 --> 3:30:02.320]  point here this is what all of this is about
[3:30:02.320 --> 3:30:05.760]  everything that we're seeing now it's not about covet that's not what this is
[3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:09.120]  about it's ultimately about this what claus is
[3:30:09.120 --> 3:30:12.160]  talking about he says because when we get the e-bucks in
[3:30:12.160 --> 3:30:14.480]  place when there's a big e-buck system and everything's
[3:30:14.480 --> 3:30:17.440]  electronic and there's an internet of things
[3:30:17.440 --> 3:30:21.680]  what she says requires 5g 5g is going up everywhere
[3:30:21.680 --> 3:30:26.160]  to facilitate this new infrastructure
[3:30:26.160 --> 3:30:29.920]  so that the internet of things can transfer all of that data
[3:30:29.920 --> 3:30:33.120]  so that the embedded the embedded microchips
[3:30:33.120 --> 3:30:38.000]  can follow and trace everything he says all of that
[3:30:38.000 --> 3:30:42.240]  will be able to tell the centralized ai systems
[3:30:42.240 --> 3:30:49.520]  how to track and control the carbon emissions why does that matter
[3:30:49.520 --> 3:30:53.920]  because he's not talking about carbon emissions you are the carbon emission
[3:30:53.920 --> 3:30:56.720]  that's the point humans are the carbon emission
[3:30:56.720 --> 3:31:01.280]  that's what he's talking about and he says we'll use the ubi
[3:31:01.280 --> 3:31:04.240]  right this quasi socialist idea of ubi which
[3:31:04.240 --> 3:31:07.440]  i mean in theory it sounds good oh why don't why doesn't zuckerberg just send
[3:31:07.440 --> 3:31:10.080]  me two thousand dollars a month and then i can live in it
[3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:13.840]  well yeah i deserve that yeah but it's a trap dummy
[3:31:13.840 --> 3:31:18.640]  it's intended to get you on the dole so that then they can shut off your
[3:31:18.640 --> 3:31:25.200]  zuck bucks you see so the ubi he says universal basic income
[3:31:25.200 --> 3:31:28.000]  which they're all throwing around and tossing around he says
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:35.120]  will be connected to this this giant ai internet of things control grid
[3:31:35.120 --> 3:31:39.520]  and once we've got everybody on that dole system on that government cheese
[3:31:39.520 --> 3:31:45.360]  system he says then we've got him he says then we can control not even not
[3:31:45.360 --> 3:31:50.560]  just the monetary system but they can control he says
[3:31:50.560 --> 3:31:54.720]  who goes into the future whether you get to have children
[3:31:54.720 --> 3:31:57.680]  because you can't have everybody having kids he says
[3:31:57.680 --> 3:32:00.800]  in fact he goes further and says we're going to have to know everything about
[3:32:00.800 --> 3:32:05.040]  your dna and your genetic lineage your biometric history
[3:32:05.040 --> 3:32:09.200]  to determine if according to some computer somewhere
[3:32:09.200 --> 3:32:12.800]  right some ai some terminator system to
[3:32:12.800 --> 3:32:17.840]  to determine whether you have the genes fit to go into the future
[3:32:17.840 --> 3:32:22.560]  but guess what most people are not going to have the genes fit to go into the
[3:32:22.560 --> 3:32:25.920]  into the future according to them because when he says he's pro-human and by
[3:32:25.920 --> 3:32:28.960]  well he does have this kind of this kind of shady
[3:32:28.960 --> 3:32:35.600]  shifty pro-human chapter now if he's pro-human and then on the other hand he's
[3:32:35.600 --> 3:32:41.360]  also for depopulation right what pro-human group do you think he's
[3:32:41.360 --> 3:32:44.960]  talking about he's talking about the elite that's what he means by pro-human
[3:32:44.960 --> 3:32:47.920]  because he also says that the only people going into the future are the
[3:32:47.920 --> 3:32:52.080]  ones that have the right dna now this was all talked about
[3:32:52.080 --> 3:32:56.080]  a hundred years ago right the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[3:32:56.080 --> 3:32:59.520]  the sterilization the the the race science all this stuff
[3:32:59.520 --> 3:33:04.640]  eugenics it was talked about in 1946 as the governing philosophy of the
[3:33:04.640 --> 3:33:09.200]  united nations unesco and when we come back i will show you
[3:33:09.200 --> 3:33:13.520]  that that is exactly what julian huxley the brother of alice huxley
[3:33:13.520 --> 3:33:17.920]  talked about in his famous book the philosophy of unesco

[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:37.920]  that in the middle of 2020 the democrats as well as many republican leaders will
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:42.480]  be calling for the united nations who edict that all
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:49.040]  americans wear masks be a quote federal order and mandate totally
[3:36:49.040 --> 3:36:53.200]  unconstitutional annihilating states rights
[3:36:53.200 --> 3:36:57.600]  think about that a woman can kill her baby you pay for illegal alien's health
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:02.640]  here but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:07.200]  plus times less than what they said even if you believe the official story
[3:37:07.200 --> 3:37:11.120]  this is about the WHO the globalist testing their power
[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:14.560]  through the media over the federal government to set
[3:37:14.560 --> 3:37:18.400]  policy in the united states this is our punishment for not going
[3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:21.920]  with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it and by the way they
[3:37:21.920 --> 3:37:25.280]  admit that they say now your carbon's down
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:31.360]  one way or another you stupid americans
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:49.600]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:53.600]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm your guest host j dire
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:38:00.080]  and i was finishing up with claus so the last few points
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:03.680]  page 99 claus goes on to say that the internet of things will be the core
[3:38:03.680 --> 3:38:08.320]  infrastructure it will take 5g chips we will have smart city smart tech
[3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:12.080]  and this will in fact also bring about the predictive crime
[3:38:12.080 --> 3:38:16.560]  right pre-crime minority report all real he says there will be sensors
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:20.400]  everywhere right remember patreus many years ago saying that even your
[3:38:20.400 --> 3:38:24.480]  dishwasher will spy on you he was talking about this he was talking
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:29.120]  about what they would bring in through mass social
[3:38:29.120 --> 3:38:32.400]  collapse now i'm not saying patreus mentioned that i'm saying that's what
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:36.080]  claus is talking about right now how do i know there's going to be or they
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:40.480]  wanted to have mass social collapse well if you're going to get rid of markets
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:44.160]  get rid of market economies how else do you do that
[3:38:44.160 --> 3:38:48.400]  other than by trying to collapse the existing system because out of the ashes
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:51.920]  the phoenix reborn right this is the ordo abcayo system
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:58.080]  order out of chaos you got to collapse through chaos the existing older system
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:02.480]  he goes on to talk about all of those life extension technologies
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:06.240]  all of those technologies that we hear about that oh you're going to get
[3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:10.080]  you know if you've ever seen what's the tarantino film the grindhouse films
[3:39:10.080 --> 3:39:13.920]  right where rose McGowan has a giant cannon on her leg right oh you want the
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:16.560]  cannon leg that's what you think you're going to get in the future
[3:39:16.560 --> 3:39:20.720]  your cannon leg and you don't get a cannon leg only the elite get cannon legs
[3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:23.440]  i'm joking but he's talking about the the the
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:29.360]  prosthetics he's talking about the neotropics he's the brain interface with
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:33.200]  computers that wouldn't you want to have wikipedia in your head you could just
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:36.080]  search it in your head and you would never lose at quiz night because you got
[3:39:36.080 --> 3:39:40.160]  wikipedia in your head no no it's a two-way system right
[3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:43.440]  and claus says that this is all coming you can't stop it
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:46.800]  it's going to be here the nanotech will be inside you
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:50.560]  it will invade you bill gates will be inside you
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:54.240]  whether you loved and wanted an intimate relationship with bill gates or not he
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:39:58.160]  will be inside you he says we're gonna have crisper
[3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:02.960]  gene editing all of that's coming all the transhumanist stuff
[3:40:02.960 --> 3:40:06.560]  and then he says that the governing philosophy will be
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:09.920]  everything that was declared in the united nations
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:14.400]  philosophy what is the united nations philosophy did you even know
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:19.120]  they had a governing philosophy and philosophical system well they wrote one
[3:40:19.120 --> 3:40:24.160]  many years ago in 1946 and julian said
[3:40:24.160 --> 3:40:27.840]  what we're going to do is we're going to have to end the existing system now you
[3:40:27.840 --> 3:40:32.000]  think of the market system that exists the quasi free
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:34.400]  markets it's not really a free market system but
[3:40:34.400 --> 3:40:38.080]  what he calls the sort of free market system that does exist he says
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:42.800]  that's got to go away because the nation state is intimately connected
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:45.920]  with that right and the nation state that's
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:49.520]  intimately connected with that is bound up with that economic system of
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:52.720]  markets and he says that we're going to have to destroy that
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:40:57.360]  to bring in the new system exactly what claus was talking about
[3:40:57.360 --> 3:41:02.240]  so is it a conspiracy theory to talk about a planned and intentional economic
[3:41:02.240 --> 3:41:06.160]  collapse they go on mainstream media and say i hope there's an economic
[3:41:06.160 --> 3:41:08.720]  collapse so we can blame trump so we can do this right
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:12.320]  they talk about doing the very thing that's happening and then when you talk
[3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:16.800]  about it they say through gas lighting right
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:20.800]  we never said that we never said oh we never there was never anything
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:27.200]  to do with an ink dot microchip that would track you
[3:41:27.200 --> 3:41:30.720]  even though it was on the gates website it doesn't exist
[3:41:30.720 --> 3:41:34.960]  but now the bbc says that it exists so therefore it exists you see
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:38.800]  this is the games that are played and if you know basic psychological warfare
[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:43.600]  that is gas lighting right they do practice gas lighting
[3:41:43.600 --> 3:41:50.160]  it's a classic tactic now back to julian what julian says is that it's not
[3:41:50.160 --> 3:41:53.920]  just an eco collapse right because remember
[3:41:53.920 --> 3:41:56.960]  most of the people in this system they are revolutionaries they do have a
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:42:01.600]  philosophy a belief in in revolution for the purpose of
[3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:05.600]  overcoming man and not just man but also man's environment
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:10.640]  it's a biosphere level overcoming that they want to do
[3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:14.080]  and so he says that at the very beginning right within
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:19.440]  20 pages of julian's book he says that radical eugenic measures will be
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:23.360]  necessary through psychological operations because
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:28.000]  most people aren't prepared to hear or understand this truth
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:31.200]  what he's talking about is called this this is what's known as dysgenics
[3:42:31.200 --> 3:42:34.640]  okay so eugenics being racial hygiene and purity
[3:42:34.640 --> 3:42:37.920]  dysgenics being like the intentional destruction
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:41.120]  or purging or genocide of some group right
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:45.920]  or some race he says that this intentional dysgenics will have to be
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:48.640]  done through a centralized planning system that will
[3:42:48.640 --> 3:42:52.720]  act like it's liberal act like it's humanitarian oh we love people we want
[3:42:52.720 --> 3:42:57.040]  to save people we want everybody to be happy oh yeah
[3:42:57.040 --> 3:43:02.160]  but he says propaganda and reeducation will be the means by which
[3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:06.640]  this new scientific religion will come into place
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:10.720]  so he's literally saying that that what you thought was
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:15.840]  sort of this technocratic nazi style system it will just be rebranded into a
[3:43:15.840 --> 3:43:20.240]  sort of fabian socialist style system that's not focused on one people group
[3:43:20.240 --> 3:43:23.440]  and then older nazi system was just one test system
[3:43:23.440 --> 3:43:27.360]  right it was one experiment according to birch and russell
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:32.400]  along with bolshevism sovietism being other forms of experimentation
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:36.160]  russell says that he has absolutely no problem with bolshevism or
[3:43:36.160 --> 3:43:38.320]  Stalinism he thinks they're great experiments that
[3:43:38.320 --> 3:43:43.200]  they're wonderful possibilities for where humanity can go right this
[3:43:43.200 --> 3:43:45.760]  exact same thing david rockfiller says about mal
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:49.760]  mal was a wonderful tyrant and dictator it was a great experiment
[3:43:49.760 --> 3:43:54.080]  and it could forge the way for how to have the technocracy in the future
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:43:57.520]  rockfiller says himself
[3:43:58.320 --> 3:44:01.840]  now huxley goes on to say that what we're going to have to do is
[3:44:01.840 --> 3:44:06.080]  change all of our thought processes right just like the
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:09.280]  changing image of man document says we're going to have to change man's view of
[3:44:09.280 --> 3:44:13.200]  himself and man's view of nature this will all be done through the unesco
[3:44:13.200 --> 3:44:18.640]  program infecting like a virus all areas of education and life and culture
[3:44:18.640 --> 3:44:22.560]  that's why you see the toxic culture that's why you see the push for all this
[3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:25.920]  degeneracy and it doesn't matter how many times these people get busted
[3:44:25.920 --> 3:44:29.520]  but un related groups for child trafficking all this kind of stuff
[3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:33.840]  they just deny it and they keep pushing it right you wonder oh you know 10 years
[3:44:33.840 --> 3:44:37.840]  ago we were there wasn't a push for pedophilia publicly
[3:44:37.840 --> 3:44:42.080]  now it's everywhere why because of this because of what they said they would
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:47.360]  push decades and decades ago he says that we're
[3:44:47.360 --> 3:44:50.480]  going to have to have a return to primitivism
[3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:54.880]  shamanism shamanistic traditions the promotion of lsd
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:45:00.560]  all of this stuff right the huxleys right but years before the counterculture
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:05.280]  revolution of the 60s 40s right he says we're going to
[3:45:05.280 --> 3:45:08.000]  promote this stuff archaic revival primitivism
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:12.160]  to help collapse the existing market-based system
[3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:15.920]  now you think yeah there's problems in the existing market-based system
[3:45:15.920 --> 3:45:20.800]  but the the trick that they play is ah you see just like bane right remember
[3:45:20.800 --> 3:45:23.840]  what bane does bane says there's all these problems in your
[3:45:23.840 --> 3:45:28.000]  existing you know bruce wane uh batman city
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:32.560]  arkham right whatever uh we got to change all this and what does he bring
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:36.560]  he brings something far worse right he brings chopchats
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:38.960]  you see
[3:45:40.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  these elites who are way above those street commies
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:47.120]  they're much more interested in the long-term game
[3:45:47.120 --> 3:45:51.280]  they don't care about collapsing one city
[3:45:51.280 --> 3:45:56.160]  they don't care about losing ground and they're not ultimately going to put
[3:45:56.160 --> 3:46:00.480]  these low iq commies in charge but not that's not who's going to run things
[3:46:00.480 --> 3:46:03.920]  these university marxists are not going to run things
[3:46:03.920 --> 3:46:08.480]  who's going to run things are the technocrats and ai and that's what is
[3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:11.280]  so amazing about this this julien huxley document
[3:46:11.280 --> 3:46:16.880]  is that he said back in the 40s and by the way he's
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:22.480]  he glowingly praises linen vi linen he says vi linen was a masterful
[3:46:22.480 --> 3:46:25.200]  propagandist and he kind of had this
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:29.680]  incipient this this nascent idea of a technocracy
[3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:33.120]  but he didn't go about it the right way right now
[3:46:33.120 --> 3:46:36.960]  with the technocratic mindset there's a better way to go about this
[3:46:36.960 --> 3:46:43.440]  we use the slow kill slow track baby and model bring it in slow bits and pieces
[3:46:43.440 --> 3:46:47.360]  right then we can bring in the actual
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:53.360]  technocracy which will allow the elite to transcend to go to the next level
[3:46:53.360 --> 3:46:56.800]  he's the guy who coined the term transhumanism
[3:46:56.800 --> 3:47:01.520]  right the luciferian idea you heard millie weaver in the last
[3:47:01.520 --> 3:47:05.280]  segment with alex talking about how the luciferian idea was part of some of
[3:47:05.280 --> 3:47:08.320]  these groups yes all of these marxist groups have always had
[3:47:08.320 --> 3:47:14.160]  this luciferian idea at the root which is to overthrow god to storm heaven
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:18.720]  as the counter cultural guys leery right they all said the storm heaven
[3:47:18.720 --> 3:47:22.880]  man will become god we'll dethrone the idea of god put man there
[3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:26.480]  and by man they don't mean that you and all your friends are going to have
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:30.960]  canon legs like rose mcgowan and and death proof
[3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:34.240]  you're not going to get you're not going to become a terminator it's for the
[3:47:34.240 --> 3:47:37.440]  elite and the elite believe that everyone else
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:42.320]  needs to die so that is the governing philosophy of the united nations that's
[3:47:42.320 --> 3:47:45.200]  who's telling us what we're supposed to do
[3:47:45.200 --> 3:47:50.160]  in this covet nonsense it's not ultimately about covet it's about this
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:57.440]  and claus in 2018 it says the exact same thing as julian said in 1946 it's the
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:01.360]  same plan i've shown you two elites here give this to your friends send this
[3:48:01.360 --> 3:48:05.760]  video out show them two of the top elite riders
[3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:10.480]  have full continuity from the 40s to the to the 2020s
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:15.280]  and it's the same plan i'm j dire jays analysis you can go to jays analysis
