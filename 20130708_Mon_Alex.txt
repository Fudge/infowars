[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:36.320]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones Vladimir Putin yesterday
[00:36.320 --> 00:43.600]  warned of a civil war in Egypt I think you're already seeing a civil war in Egypt all part
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.840]  of the globalist on record strategy of tension vulcanization destabilization global program
[00:51.360 --> 00:56.640]  that's what they have in store for the United States many years down the road the places like
[00:56.640 --> 01:02.640]  Egypt are a little bit further along in the new world order plan we're going to be looking at that
[01:03.200 --> 01:09.200]  on this Monday the eighth day of July 2013 global transmission Larry Pratt will be joining us at
[01:09.200 --> 01:14.080]  the start of the next hour for 30 minutes the head of gunners of America to look at some of the
[01:14.080 --> 01:19.840]  new fast and furious type scandals that have broke in the back of the newspaper but have not
[01:19.840 --> 01:26.640]  gotten a lot of attention and the state of the anti gunners extra judicial outside of the law
[01:26.640 --> 01:33.600]  UN treaty operations because Obama says he doesn't care if the Senate doesn't ratify it
[01:33.600 --> 01:40.960]  he's going to implement it so we'll be looking at that coming up in the second hour Adam Kokesh
[01:40.960 --> 01:46.480]  is going to pop in for about 1015 minutes I haven't talked to him yet he said he's been
[01:46.480 --> 01:53.760]  off the radar since he went and locked and loaded or loaded a shotgun outside the Capitol
[01:53.760 --> 02:00.080]  in defiance of the unconstitutional law that's been overthrown in DC so he'll be giving us the
[02:00.080 --> 02:05.520]  first media interview that he's done since he did that on Independence Day last week as a true
[02:07.040 --> 02:13.840]  follower of terrorists like George Washington very extreme very evil very bad he also thinks
[02:13.840 --> 02:18.960]  that you have a fourth amendment a tent amendment and should not have police all over the country
[02:18.960 --> 02:25.120]  now doing proctology exams on people on the side of the road a new video emerged over the weekend
[02:25.120 --> 02:34.640]  that I watched this morning of Texas women again with police male police on top of it
[02:35.280 --> 02:41.200]  doing cavity searches and just just unprecedented and it shows how whacked out government's gotten
[02:41.920 --> 02:47.600]  by the way they the government is on record as I've said 50 trillion times and as you know
[02:48.320 --> 02:53.120]  shipping the drugs into the country these women were coming back from the beach
[02:53.120 --> 03:00.560]  to Houston in their bikinis two friends actually two cousins and uh well some will say well it's
[03:00.560 --> 03:05.200]  because they're black this happened I don't know I've seen footage of blondes brunettes white
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.920]  Hispanic black seems to be women though and they just tell them get a bend over the hood
[03:11.120 --> 03:15.520]  and and you can have multiple women same glove just a total assault in my view
[03:15.520 --> 03:23.440]  you but it's the officer's order I order you out of your house we're going to use your house

[03:48.960 --> 03:54.320]  it's all part of the same orgy we've seen thousands of times in different nations in history
[03:54.320 --> 04:00.240]  when the tyrants take over the decadent population submits I mean this is happening
[04:00.240 --> 04:06.720]  because we do have a slovenly arrogant self-centered thuggish population as well
[04:06.720 --> 04:14.400]  not everybody but but in general it's a rotting society uh with no self-respect uh in fact uh
[04:14.400 --> 04:21.280]  san francisco flight 77 crash why did so many passengers evacuate with their bags forms asked
[04:21.280 --> 04:26.640]  well they should be asking what's buried in the article why did they not help the children

[09:01.040 --> 09:08.640]  the courage of this modern roza parks i'm not sitting at the back of the bus type activity
[09:09.680 --> 09:15.040]  against these control freak miscreant criminals that have hijacked our nation speaking of that
[09:15.040 --> 09:22.240]  there's a new gallop poll out and i think it's much higher than this 71 agree founding fathers
[09:22.240 --> 09:29.920]  would be ashamed of country today and they're right well the police are trained and we show this video
[09:29.920 --> 09:35.440]  in my film roda tyranny and we've shown countless training manuals they're actually told the founding
[09:35.440 --> 09:41.360]  fathers were bad people then they swear an oath to a constitution because that's law
[09:42.880 --> 09:48.640]  and to uphold it and then they are told anyone that makes frequent references the constitution
[09:49.680 --> 09:54.560]  go ahead and put them in a terrorist file that's in the fbi training manuals just type in constitutional
[09:54.560 --> 10:00.080]  terrorist and you'll see let's not exaggerate over a hundred manuals of the fbi put out in
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.720]  the last 15 years that are public these are on their website they've got over a hundred
[10:04.720 --> 10:14.160]  current ones for every business there is tattoo parlors barbershops bars uh car washes somebody
[10:14.160 --> 10:20.480]  talking about the founding fathers and freedom give the police a cold imagine he'll read dawn
[10:20.480 --> 10:26.320]  of the soviets taken over in the 80s if you hear american pigs speaking of founding fathers of freedom
[10:26.320 --> 10:34.960]  report them immediately i mean this is how bizarro it's gotten so we're going to be breaking all of
[10:34.960 --> 10:42.560]  that down also some good news uh train wreck of obama care begins to unravel massive government
[10:42.560 --> 10:49.120]  boondoggles set to self-destruct by 2015 well it's all written to be selectively enforced
[10:49.120 --> 10:57.040]  uh but if you resisted it's so nakedly unconstitutional it will be defeated it is a tax as the supreme court
[10:57.040 --> 11:06.160]  ruled two private offshore banks that own the big insurance companies to make you purchase insurance
[11:07.440 --> 11:13.920]  now what happens when you've got to buy something you've got to buy textbooks to go to college
[11:13.920 --> 11:21.040]  that's why the average textbook cost over 200 smackers when a similar book at barns and noble
[11:21.040 --> 11:27.360]  would cost 20 they've got all sorts of military textbooks and big thick publications that are
[11:27.360 --> 11:34.960]  even better than the soviet style bilge uh that you pay for i see some textbooks that are $500
[11:34.960 --> 11:43.280]  now that you've got to have a $500 outdated crud filled piece of garbage well it's the same thing
[11:43.280 --> 11:48.800]  you've got to buy car insurance so it goes up and up and up and after that unconstitutional
[11:48.800 --> 11:54.160]  president said well you've got to buy health insurance and now you've got to buy in california
[11:54.160 --> 12:00.880]  gun insurance if the governor signs it oh and insurance to buy ammo and oh lo and behold
[12:02.080 --> 12:04.400]  once they turn a right into a privilege they can outlaw it
[12:04.400 --> 12:14.240]  so we're going to be going over all of that news and this is well mother tells how she was strapped
[12:14.240 --> 12:21.600]  down while prison doctors persuaded her to be sterilized and and and they put it in persuaded
[12:21.600 --> 12:29.280]  that's in quotes they strapped her down and forced her uh as nearly 250 californian inmates
[12:29.280 --> 12:37.280]  were pressured into surgery that's just who they know about rising the specter of california's
[12:37.280 --> 12:44.480]  dark eugenics history and then people will argue well we shouldn't have these prison inmates being
[12:44.480 --> 12:49.760]  able to have kids again oh they're going to end up sterilizing you when you go on welfare
[12:50.400 --> 12:53.760]  which and then people say well that's a good idea there's too many poor people having kids
[12:53.760 --> 13:00.000]  that's the plan is to totally break down society and then bring in orwellian control
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.360]  that is not going to even be targeted on the giant masses of poor people it never is it's going to
[13:05.360 --> 13:12.000]  be targeted on middle class we're the enemy i don't care what color you are if you want to be
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  self-sufficient and outside of their cult they're coming after you and speaking of that here's a
[13:16.000 --> 13:27.120]  cns news story it's up on drudge and on info wars info wars dot com and up on drudge report dot com
[13:27.120 --> 13:35.040]  101 million americans get food aid from federal government more than the number of private sector
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.520]  workers here i'll i'll i'll move over the box um so we can actually show tv viewers this
[13:41.520 --> 13:47.920]  or you guys can just go and punch it up on your computer and show people since we put new computers
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.200]  in here it's very hard for me to put stuff on screen without it being cut off and i want to
[13:51.200 --> 13:59.440]  rectify i think we can figure out a plan to do that 101 million americans get food aid from federal
[13:59.440 --> 14:09.280]  government more than the number of private sector workers that's why it's going to be game over soon
[14:09.280 --> 14:16.640]  unless we just start non-compliant with everything because they've got a giant mass of drooling
[14:16.640 --> 14:23.520]  fluoride heads who have been chemically lobotomized who are living off the dole and don't even know
[14:23.520 --> 14:29.040]  what country they're in what state what the three branches of governments are in some cases that
[14:29.040 --> 14:35.040]  they don't know their head from a hole in the ground that's why all over the country cops
[14:35.040 --> 14:41.360]  are pulling people over mainly women for speeding or for burnout tail light and saying all right get
[14:41.360 --> 14:46.640]  up against the car and we're such animals to the government now they don't even change gloves
[14:47.360 --> 14:54.560]  when according to juris prudence and common law it is a rape to stick your hands in someone's pants
[14:54.560 --> 15:01.360]  and put your body uh put your hand into their body two women you've you've seen that famous video a
[15:01.360 --> 15:09.280]  blonde and a brunette both white two women outside dallas state police and now more videos are coming
[15:09.280 --> 15:13.520]  out it's by the way continuing they're not stopping and they just pull you over and say all right i'm
[15:13.520 --> 15:18.400]  gonna search your car they don't even ask permission like the old days to trick you into letting them
[15:18.400 --> 15:24.000]  violate your fourth amendment the sheep don't know what planet they're on they get out they comply with
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.960]  everything unconstitutionally and so of course it's all right now i'm gonna wear the same glove
[15:30.960 --> 15:36.640]  it'd be illegal if they change gloves but it's serious assault when it's the same glove and
[15:37.280 --> 15:41.440]  the female officer but now they're using male officers why not the slaves will put up with it
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.400]  going inside
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.280]  one woman's well it's one it's one glove for orifices
[15:53.280 --> 16:01.760]  one glove two women two girls one glove and this is how it works and listen
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.360]  next it's going to be your kids like tsa we're going down the pants of kids thousands of photos and
[16:07.360 --> 16:13.680]  videos there was a big backlash they pulled back for a little while now they're back doing it again
[16:13.680 --> 16:17.040]  and and they're going to pull you over and they're going to get your three-year-old out and they're
[16:17.040 --> 16:20.800]  going to ram their hand into them and if you don't like it they're going to line you up and taser
[16:20.800 --> 16:24.240]  you and if you resist that they're going to shove a gun right in your head and splatter your
[16:24.240 --> 16:30.880]  brains all over the ground because that's how america the cursed nation is if you'll kill 53
[16:30.880 --> 16:38.960]  million babies and say they're not humans well why why are you a human and i love how
[16:38.960 --> 16:53.840]  they're always pushing this like it's for our own good and how it's to stop drugs
[16:54.800 --> 17:01.440]  ladies and gentlemen in case you didn't know it's not a rumor that our ships were never
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.400]  attacked to get us into vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin that came out in 64 the average person
[17:06.400 --> 17:12.880]  just heard the rumor so it became a conspiracy theory now been completely declassified 2004
[17:14.960 --> 17:21.840]  it's a fact all over the u.s. they sterilize foster children they sterilize them here in austin
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.640]  and the doctors that have told me about it are like but you don't tell anybody okay you're a
[17:26.640 --> 17:34.000]  journalist this is off record they give the children in austin cancer virus orally illegally
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.560]  at these big public clinics at the sport stadiums in zilker park and i've had a top doctor tell me
[17:40.560 --> 17:46.720]  this but say you go investigate it you know i don't want to be on the news and we went and
[17:46.720 --> 17:50.080]  investigated and surely enough it's true and the health department said we're not going to discuss
[17:50.080 --> 17:57.440]  that with you they don't just take foster kids and tie their tubes or or give the males vasectomies
[17:57.440 --> 18:04.480]  they give them cancer you may take them 30 years to get it but they're giving them the
[18:04.480 --> 18:11.120]  cancer virus that implants in all of their major cell groups and so that's what i'm talking about
[18:11.120 --> 18:16.880]  here there's no there's no making deals with the new world order there's no playing games and and the
[18:16.880 --> 18:21.680]  cops are just brainwashed zombies just like the public they believe they have the authority
[18:21.680 --> 18:25.680]  just like nazis believe they have the authority to put people in sand pits and shoot them in the head
[18:25.680 --> 18:31.040]  they believe they have the authority to pull you over and ram their hand into your body
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.080]  and they're going to do it and they're going to lose lawsuits and keep doing it because
[18:36.080 --> 18:39.600]  the bankers want to bankrupt america they hope they lose more lawsuits they don't care
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.760]  that's why they've been told lose all the lawsuits you want drive them into submission
[18:45.840 --> 18:52.480]  by the way the daily mail says oh you know not really they were pressured actually the news 10
[18:52.480 --> 19:00.400]  abc out of california female inmates sterilized in california prisons without approval so you
[19:00.400 --> 19:04.240]  know the daily mail is kind of whitewashing it actually they forced these women to do it
[19:04.240 --> 19:10.960]  and they took them and tied them down they've always done that and again the argument here
[19:10.960 --> 19:16.880]  is well there's too many people the point is ladies and gentlemen they've picked a plastic
[19:16.880 --> 19:23.760]  system out of thousands of formulas that has estrogen in it to feminize men and hyper feminize
[19:23.760 --> 19:28.240]  women women are like good i'll be hyper feminine yeah you'll you all of your sexual tissues will
[19:28.240 --> 19:36.960]  hyper age you will die but again 101 million americans get food aid from federal government
[19:36.960 --> 19:42.160]  more than the number of private sector workers and it's growing that's why they're deindustrializing
[19:42.160 --> 19:46.160]  that's why they're putting regulations on independent businesses that could give people jobs
[19:46.160 --> 19:52.400]  to make it too hard so that everybody just goes and watches opera and obama and just drinks their
[19:52.400 --> 19:57.040]  fluoride and goes quietly into the night and we're going to look at egypt and a lot of other

[24:39.520 --> 24:47.120]  coming up in the next segment i will not just take your calls i will elaborate on the egypt
[24:47.120 --> 24:52.560]  situation i'm gonna get to some of that in a moment but i want to finish up talking about our
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.360]  society talking about the cultural trends these are not just my observations i go off of the
[24:59.360 --> 25:06.720]  sociological numbers that you hear us hear breaking down every day and my own experiences in life
[25:08.800 --> 25:16.240]  where i will see more and more people act like selfish stupid evil greedy demons
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.240]  and that's why the police are getting worse and worse it's because they are a reflection of the
[25:22.240 --> 25:31.040]  public as well our government is a reflection of what we've become now there are giant groups of
[25:31.040 --> 25:37.440]  good people i would say more than half the population generally are hardworking good decent
[25:37.440 --> 25:49.920]  people who are criminally naive and simple minded and at their base cowardly and i would call the
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.840]  coward is more of a an excuse of oh i don't want to be out front i don't want to be arrogant i don't
[25:55.840 --> 26:02.480]  want to force myself into public view i'm just gonna put my head down and that you know that's
[26:02.480 --> 26:08.800]  a manly thing to do know what that is is insanely cowardly and is the road to absolute enslavement
[26:09.920 --> 26:10.720]  that's what it's called
[26:10.720 --> 26:20.400]  i get being a quiet person i get leaving people alone minding your business i do that with
[26:20.400 --> 26:26.160]  individuals but when it comes to organized corporations or organized government or gangs of
[26:26.160 --> 26:35.360]  people i instinctively get very angry and very aggressive one time i had drag rats um
[26:35.360 --> 26:41.200]  tommy pilotta was with me we were downtown having a business meeting filmmaker and we walk out and
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.280]  these drag rats aren't like your normal homeless people they're not all bad but large groups of
[26:45.280 --> 26:51.040]  them have raped people beat people up all sorts of stuff there's been a lot of cases of it there's
[26:51.040 --> 26:57.360]  even been deaths and i walked down eight or nine of them said you know basically hey you know give
[26:57.360 --> 27:03.600]  me some money and i turned around to them and i said oh really give you some money what do you
[27:03.600 --> 27:08.320]  mean they said well it'd be good for you to give us money if you know what i mean and i said no what
[27:08.320 --> 27:12.240]  do you mean well if you know what's good for you and i said why don't you all get up and i'm
[27:12.240 --> 27:17.680]  gonna stomp your heads into the ground right now and i couldn't help it folks i mean i was ready
[27:17.680 --> 27:23.680]  to stomp them into the ground and again i grew up in dallas getting a lot of fights the few times
[27:23.680 --> 27:28.320]  i wasn't in the right in the fight i'd get my butt kicked because i couldn't get up if the fight was
[27:28.320 --> 27:33.760]  50 50 i couldn't even swing a punch i couldn't even get upset i had no energy it was only when
[27:33.760 --> 27:38.160]  somebody was in the wrong somebody trying to mug me in a parking lot of a group of people trying to
[27:38.160 --> 27:48.880]  assault me that i would turn into absolute king kong on pcp because instinctively i get completely
[27:48.880 --> 27:56.720]  angry and of course they backed off at that point and it wasn't that i'm mr tough guy it's that
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.960]  eight or nine people who i know have a history of abusing and and raping and grabbing women off
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.520]  their bicycles and robbing them i wanted to stomp their guts into the ground and the reason they
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.760]  didn't take the fight was they figured out even though they might have won in the end because
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.720]  i've had my leg broken and stuff like that fight a big group of people five guys yeah the whole
[28:14.720 --> 28:19.600]  issue is is that they knew to back off because they knew this they weren't going to get the
[28:19.600 --> 28:25.360]  money out of my wallet easy there was going to be a price to pay and that is the difference between
[28:25.360 --> 28:32.000]  a free society and a slave society bending over literally on the side of the highway now all over
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.400]  the country but sadly my own state is so whacked out that all over the country cops are taking money
[28:38.400 --> 28:42.640]  out of old ladies wallets how much money you got in there well i've got two thousand dollars sonny
[28:42.640 --> 28:48.320]  i carry it with me boom they take it there's no law saying they can do that they claim it's a forfeiture
[28:48.320 --> 28:54.640]  on site with no proof of drugs and a lot of these cops aren't even conscious criminals
[28:54.640 --> 28:59.840]  they're so whacked out the local judge has told them to do it and then it turns out the local
[28:59.840 --> 29:05.360]  judge is the one getting the money and living in some million dollar house i mean it is
[29:05.360 --> 29:10.080]  un i'm talking about real cases i just mentioned there a composite of several a tennessee and texas
[29:10.080 --> 29:18.480]  case indiana does it louisiana is horrible on record shaking people down and when you put up
[29:18.480 --> 29:24.080]  with it it's what allows it to get worse standing up to it is what puts it back in the box and when
[29:24.080 --> 29:32.400]  i come back i want to talk about the thug culture the the oppressor culture versus the jellyfish
[29:32.400 --> 29:39.200]  culture and tie it into san francisco seven seven seven crash the passengers left even their own
[29:39.200 --> 29:45.200]  children it's being reported and didn't help them they would go to get their bags i mean give me a

[33:17.280 --> 33:18.640]  a new world order
[33:21.840 --> 33:30.240]  i say give obama 20 peace prizes and push 100 the front lines of the information war it's alex
[33:30.240 --> 33:37.680]  jones what we are looking at right and wrong and you are
[33:43.760 --> 33:47.120]  by the way i didn't mean to flash back and start talking about getting in fights with
[33:47.120 --> 33:55.840]  homeless people but all over the country there's the phenomenon of runaways of young people who then
[33:55.840 --> 34:00.880]  are usually led by like a 25 30 year old and they're involved in a lot of crime and austin is infested
[34:00.880 --> 34:06.080]  with these people now some of them are actually nice and are like nomadic groups they then get fed
[34:06.080 --> 34:11.920]  on by the criminal groups and my point is is that the instinct of good people should be to stand up
[34:11.920 --> 34:18.080]  to groups like that and so when i see government as a giant gang and the irs running around robbing
[34:18.080 --> 34:24.000]  people without due process in an unconstitutional tax but even within the confines of people that
[34:24.000 --> 34:31.280]  have paid being robbed and and having their homes and wedding rings stolen the horror stories are
[34:31.280 --> 34:38.000]  literally legion upon legion upon legion that's being run by the congress by the president by the
[34:38.000 --> 34:45.120]  central government we act like the tsa some bad agency or the irs or the nsa this is all part of
[34:45.120 --> 34:50.800]  a plan there's a reason the street lights are laid out in a certain way and the street cameras are
[34:50.800 --> 34:58.160]  laid out in a certain way in the street signs it's an organized program and most of it's secret
[34:59.360 --> 35:02.800]  what we know about it is is they're trying to change the genetic environment of the planet
[35:03.680 --> 35:07.840]  where it's artificial and you've got to go to them to even be able to have kids or have crops
[35:08.480 --> 35:13.120]  and they're busy spraying aluminum dioxide barium salts and other chemicals i've got a story out
[35:13.120 --> 35:22.800]  today that are on record thousands of times in the metric worse than the old cfcs that were in
[35:22.800 --> 35:30.160]  spray bottles why is the government trying to destroy the ozone layer in a giant secret program
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.840]  that it's declassified they're doing the program and what they're spraying last time i checked five
[35:35.840 --> 35:41.360]  billion dollars a year department of energy alone just to pay for the program in north america
[35:41.360 --> 35:49.120]  these people operate like they're aliens from a trillion miles away come here to destroy us
[35:49.120 --> 35:51.760]  i'm not saying that's what they are they might as well be that
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.720]  you understand when i got up here and told you about our family pediatrician who had one of
[35:58.720 --> 36:04.160]  the biggest pediatrician outfits here in austin he recently sold it and retired i'm not going to
[36:04.160 --> 36:09.440]  say anymore grab me by the arm seven eight years ago and saying listen you know these big free clinics
[36:09.440 --> 36:16.320]  they have i listen to your show and it's true he goes guess what we were given because doctors are
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.400]  supposed to volunteer it's like compulsory volunteerism and they've got to go back to schooling and
[36:20.400 --> 36:24.400]  stuff you're supposed to do so much volunteer time so the doctors go to the big zhulker park and
[36:24.400 --> 36:27.920]  sports stadiums i don't know where i live it happens in your area and you might have three
[36:27.920 --> 36:33.760]  thousand people come to get their shots and he said he looked at the dose vials they were giving
[36:33.760 --> 36:45.440]  liquid 1960s batch totally illegal polio live polio that had sv 40 in it a highly contagious
[36:45.440 --> 36:51.040]  cancer virus that you could pull up the government's own numbers they believe contributed to over
[36:51.040 --> 36:58.800]  100 million cancers just from the 50s through the 70s when it was made illegal by the way i see
[36:58.800 --> 37:05.360]  in the news all the time they're still using that those original batches to replicate it and then
[37:05.360 --> 37:09.440]  they grow it on fetal tissue they grow it on eggs you name it and they're shipping it to africa
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.320]  asia you name it that's why all over the world they go we don't want that in pakistan and and in
[37:14.320 --> 37:20.720]  nigeria they run from the white witch doctors in the un witch doctors because folks they used to run
[37:20.720 --> 37:26.400]  to the medicine man now they run from the from the european or the e u or the un medicine man
[37:26.400 --> 37:37.440]  simian virus 40 sv 40 polio vaccine fact sheet it was discovered in 1960 that's the cdc's website
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.000]  soon after the virus was found in the polio vaccine and it says more than 98 million americans
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.720]  received one or more dosages of it all in the bowl in that suite by the way they're still giving it
[37:46.720 --> 37:52.640]  and they're still sterilizing people in every town and every city and they're still putting poison in
[37:52.640 --> 37:59.360]  the water hydrofluorosalic acid on record that wrecks your mind and wrecks your fertility
[38:02.080 --> 38:05.760]  and people hear all this and you can go look it up and find out it's true i mean the crew's
[38:05.760 --> 38:09.200]  sitting in there just typing in whatever i say and pulling it up on the government's own websites
[38:10.160 --> 38:16.000]  i'm not making any of this up and that doctor had the courage to tell me
[38:17.760 --> 38:21.120]  but he also had the courage to grab me hard by the arm and say and i told you you don't tell
[38:21.120 --> 38:25.760]  anybody my name you can tell the story and he said i went and complained about it and was told to
[38:25.760 --> 38:35.360]  shut up they know full well here bring your kid down to zilker park we're gonna give them liquid
[38:35.360 --> 38:45.760]  monkey virus that is a death sentence a death sentence and there'll be no police investigation
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.560]  there'll be no discussion on the news just like when i get up on air and say all over the country
[38:50.560 --> 38:58.000]  in the hydrofluorosalic acid they're adding radioactive isotopes local media goes out checks it
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  at the at the wastewater plant and the treatment plant and then the geiger counter's off the
[39:02.000 --> 39:08.960]  chart and they say what is this and then locals go we don't know why it is forget about it must be
[39:08.960 --> 39:16.080]  in the aquifer must be naturally radioactive and again i just keep going back to this over
[39:16.080 --> 39:21.680]  and over again instead of all the news because they're killing us it's back in the la news
[39:21.680 --> 39:27.040]  that they forcibly are sterilizing people of course they are illegally and no one's gonna
[39:27.040 --> 39:35.760]  get in trouble because it's a plan you know how the sv-40 another cocktail of those specific viruses
[39:35.760 --> 39:41.360]  that by the way didn't come from monkeys dr. sock and others bragged about it those were cooked
[39:41.360 --> 39:46.400]  up specially for you and your family sure they grew them on monkey kidneys but they didn't come
[39:46.400 --> 39:52.800]  from monkeys that's a weaponized virus program guess what they do they go plug into your dna
[39:52.800 --> 39:58.720]  they go into viral plaques is what they're called they engineered these whole family perfectly to
[39:58.720 --> 40:05.600]  wait until your hormone level lowers and when your hormone level lowers it then triggers the viral
[40:05.600 --> 40:15.680]  plaques similar to shingles which is really just in the whole family of herpes when does it trigger
[40:15.680 --> 40:22.080]  when you get older when does it get to where it kills people when you're old when when you're young
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.840]  when you're under stress or have a lot of problems that's when it breaks out folks
[40:26.800 --> 40:31.920]  there's stuff a lot worse than herpes it's called deadly you know what sv-40 can do in the sinus
[40:31.920 --> 40:39.440]  the uh the particular cancer you look it up i forget its latin name but it looks like blue yogurt
[40:40.320 --> 40:47.760]  purple yogurt how's that growing into your brain just a little a little gift for you and your
[40:47.760 --> 40:54.480]  family they're murdering you with pleasure and if i walk up to austin cops and start saying hey the
[40:54.480 --> 40:59.360]  government's murdering people the dime core building right there uh in town uh here's the
[40:59.360 --> 41:04.320]  washington posters the uh chicago tribune how they got caught running child kidnapping rings
[41:04.320 --> 41:09.760]  the cops i've done this forego i know i work for them part time get out of here alex
[41:11.200 --> 41:15.360]  that happened in front of pf james and then another time the cops are like yeah we know what
[41:15.360 --> 41:20.800]  do we do about it what are we supposed to do about it we're told who we can investigate i mean
[41:21.360 --> 41:26.400]  okay i said i'd go to your phone calls and i'm gonna go to them but i talk about the culture of thugs
[41:26.400 --> 41:32.720]  people that have figured this out decide to act like predators and thugs
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.440]  so whether you're a street criminal a corporate criminal a corrupt cop there's that whole culture
[41:42.320 --> 41:47.040]  or then you've got the culture of the slaves who just get real self-serving though and put
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.160]  their head down to everything but then do the minimum amount of work suck off things don't care
[41:52.160 --> 42:00.320]  about anybody but themselves and think that's an attribute then you've got the nanny staters
[42:00.320 --> 42:03.600]  who go around persecuting people in the name of the government whether they work for the government
[42:03.600 --> 42:07.680]  or not who don't really care about in the major studies that are out like the environmentalist
[42:07.680 --> 42:12.320]  who don't the fake environmentalist they don't care that a big canadian study last year they
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.720]  don't actually care about real issues they just want the power from it that they are the moral
[42:16.720 --> 42:22.560]  authority i think this canadian study was a major government study that the environmentalist were
[42:22.560 --> 42:29.920]  six times more likely to be thieves and to be dishonest the groups that answer that they were
[42:29.920 --> 42:35.760]  the biggest environmentalist because it's just a way to say i'm a Pharisee i'm good all the rest
[42:35.760 --> 42:42.160]  of you are bad meanwhile real conservationist real environmentalist people that are really concerned
[42:42.160 --> 42:48.080]  oh we alex they're not growing corn in texas that has live hiv virus in it
[42:52.560 --> 42:54.880]  and no one will even look that up it's associated press
[42:57.280 --> 42:59.680]  protogen is the company
[43:03.920 --> 43:07.440]  and that's why if a cop pulls me over because i'm driving late at night or something and i
[43:07.440 --> 43:11.600]  know i'm not speeding and they go mind of the surgeon got any drugs i'm like do you have any
[43:11.600 --> 43:17.760]  drugs because you know the government ships most of them in they're like oh oh what's your problem
[43:17.760 --> 43:22.640]  what's my problem they're lining kids up nationwide and giving them oral
[43:23.520 --> 43:28.400]  cancer viruses live cancer viruses that's communicable and you're just going to laugh
[43:28.400 --> 43:34.080]  at me because see it's too big of an issue it's too big for you to deal with so you're just going
[43:34.080 --> 43:40.000]  to pick on me and act like you're holding society together and the thin blue line blah blah blah
[43:40.000 --> 43:48.240]  when we've got psycho eugenicist running the whole show but look at this article from Forbes it's
[43:48.240 --> 43:54.560]  up on info wars dot com san francisco seven seven seven crash why did so many passengers evacuate
[43:54.560 --> 44:00.800]  with bags and again i've seen it in our local news that when the drag rats will catch you know
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.920]  two young yuppie women coming out of a restaurant down on south congress or down on the old drag
[44:05.920 --> 44:09.840]  or whatever they'll they'll grab their they'll order them to give them their purse and the women
[44:09.840 --> 44:13.840]  usually had a feral just give it to them and if not they'll punch them in the nose rape them whatever
[44:15.760 --> 44:20.000]  and then i i was thinking how that's just like the police when they're like i'm going to search
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.840]  your car it's not mind if i search it's like people on the new york sub will sit on both
[44:23.840 --> 44:31.440]  sides of you and go mind if i look at your watch can i have it so they're not legally actually
[44:31.440 --> 44:36.720]  robbing you they're there there would be an inference of it and now the police are like
[44:36.720 --> 44:42.080]  i'm going to search the car give me authorization or i will taser you
[44:45.440 --> 44:49.680]  or answer my question or i will taser you failure not follow my order and the threat
[44:49.680 --> 44:56.080]  continuum of force continuum who's an abdilutah now you're all now private pile in the marine
[44:56.080 --> 45:02.880]  corps drill sergeant situation i'm going to do a cavity search you the women are in the
[45:02.880 --> 45:09.280]  bikini the video is up on info wars dot com right now in texas again you're joking right i'm not
[45:09.280 --> 45:16.320]  joking up against the car and then and then the police are like well they can play with it yeah
[45:16.320 --> 45:21.680]  they can play like when somebody comes into a park and says hey two years or three year old while
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.240]  your mom's in the bathroom at the park get in the car i said the little kid reaches their
[45:26.240 --> 45:30.960]  hand up does what they say it's the authority figure and that's what the drag rats do robbing
[45:30.960 --> 45:34.800]  people that's what the police do you know when they're knocking talks wanting to come in people's
[45:34.800 --> 45:42.080]  houses it's all criminal psychology right out of criminology 101 and that's all eugenics and all
[45:42.080 --> 45:47.680]  this is it's just a bunch of predators who want to do mean things to people setting the precedent
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.080]  that they can get away with bloody murder and then they've got useful idiots down low who actually
[45:52.080 --> 46:02.000]  believe in the whole system and so i'm not surprised that trendies flying into san francisco on 777
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.720]  out of south korea because this is this is how it is all over the world now anywhere that's
[46:06.720 --> 46:13.760]  industrialized humans are the same people are so into themselves they won't risk their life to help
[46:13.760 --> 46:21.760]  somebody who's choking or whatever or to go into a house to save people but they will risk their
[46:21.760 --> 46:28.640]  lives if their ipad is in a burning house or if they're i mean imagine the plane crashes the tail
[46:28.640 --> 46:36.400]  falls off it bursts into flame jet fuel everywhere and people are going in the overheads to get their
[46:36.400 --> 46:44.720]  bags out to then try to get out of the aircraft i mean the minute it's crashing there's flames the
[46:44.720 --> 46:50.400]  first thing i'm doing and with you know the strength that comes with caring about your kids
[46:50.400 --> 46:55.760]  is grabbing my children throwing them on my shoulder and i'd probably get incredibly hurt just jumping
[46:55.760 --> 47:05.840]  out of the hole that's just a normal behavior but no it's reported watching the videos of
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.000]  watching the videos and witnesses that it appears from the reports that people weren't even leaving
[47:10.000 --> 47:17.200]  their own kids but they wanted their bags now that's a programmed group of people that only care
[47:17.200 --> 47:27.280]  about themselves to such a point that one man even was interviewed by the new york times
[47:27.920 --> 47:31.360]  said that he grabbed his bags and then his kids they're even proud of it
[47:31.360 --> 47:38.720]  i mean i can't believe parents will let the cps take their kids clearly when there's no reason
[47:38.720 --> 47:42.800]  to do it and then when a family runs with their kids they're called terrorists on the news
[47:42.800 --> 47:47.040]  they've taken your basic normal human instinct and flushed it down the commode
[47:50.080 --> 47:53.120]  we're gonna go to break it i'm gonna come back and take your calls for two segments then
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.040]  we got larry prat popping and then i'll continue uh with your phone calls but
[47:57.040 --> 48:04.080]  but this is the difference between having a civilization and not having a civilization
[48:04.720 --> 48:10.240]  is that good men do nothing and you have a tyranny all the evil men in tyranny to flourish
[48:10.240 --> 48:14.080]  is that good men and women do nothing you know i started lifting weights again
[48:14.080 --> 48:20.240]  with light weights trying to lose weight and so maybe once a week i have time to go down to a
[48:20.240 --> 48:29.360]  local ymca and i'll watch cops come in wearing their local cop shirts and i'll watch them kind of
[48:29.360 --> 48:34.160]  strut around and bug their eyes out at people they're not too bad but i've seen groups of them in there
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.240]  and it's a totally different group of people when the fire department is always there no
[48:40.240 --> 48:45.440]  matter when i go somebody from the haves county fire department is always in there i was watching
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.920]  these guys do like 60 pull-ups and then go back and do it again and doing these things we were
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.160]  doing pull-ups and swinging their body all the way over you basically in a gymnast move
[48:54.160 --> 48:59.120]  they're so nice and friendly because they're fire department people who actually have a real job
[48:59.120 --> 49:03.760]  and who actually serve the community and i'll never forget watching the austin police with their cadets
[49:04.880 --> 49:09.760]  in a swim test and about a third of them could barely swim three of them had to be pulled out
[49:09.760 --> 49:16.080]  i even shot video of this and life jackets put on because they couldn't swim and the head police
[49:16.080 --> 49:20.880]  that were teaching them weren't that good of swimmers i mean you ought to be able to swim
[49:20.880 --> 49:26.240]  two miles to be a cop you ought to be able to do 40 pull-ups to be a cop and i'm not sitting
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.480]  there claiming i'm mr tough guy i used to do 45 pull-ups i can barely do three of them now
[49:30.480 --> 49:35.360]  but the point is as i watch these fire department guys they are the polar opposite of the police
[49:35.360 --> 49:40.960]  now not saying all police are like this but nice guys friendly not putting off a power trip and just
[49:40.960 --> 49:46.080]  savagely lifting weights and just you know in incredible shape you can kill their drug free
[49:46.080 --> 49:50.160]  too you can just look at their muscles just savagely strong because they need to be able to pick
[49:50.160 --> 49:55.360]  people up and stuff they need to be able to you know climb out of a window and and you just see
[49:55.360 --> 49:58.880]  the difference in the culture and now they're trying to corrupt the fire departments and make them
[49:58.880 --> 50:05.200]  secret police it's so disgusting to see that happen and i've talked to a lot of retired people
[50:05.200 --> 50:09.760]  read a lot of criminology 30 40 years ago all they cared about being a cop was that you were
[50:09.760 --> 50:15.920]  somewhat honest and really tough nowadays it's about hiring little social worker bureaucrats
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.320]  who are on power trips and want to dominate you because a really tough guy is not going to want
[50:20.320 --> 50:25.360]  to dominate people that haven't done anything a warrior is going to want to go after bad guys
[50:25.360 --> 50:30.800]  and defend innocent people not oh i think you might have marijuana i'm going to stick my hand
[50:30.800 --> 50:37.280]  in your rectum and then your vagina i mean that's totally illegal but their supervisors are told
[50:37.280 --> 50:44.960]  they're allowed to it's a disgusting power trip by people that can't even swim they're hiring
[50:44.960 --> 50:51.600]  people with under 100 iqs and it's a joke i do not want to be ruled over by a bunch of power tripping
[50:52.880 --> 50:59.120]  semi lobotomized morons that can't even do pull-ups we'll be right back

[54:52.160 --> 54:57.520]  in dallas and my dad had friends that were police that would come over and stuff and play cards and
[54:57.520 --> 55:02.480]  things like that they were all just really nice friendly boy scout type guys and now more and
[55:02.480 --> 55:06.880]  more they want thugs i'm not saying all departments are like this if you've got a boy scout department
[55:06.880 --> 55:12.720]  that's good but people think it's tough now to be a thug i saw two different spy thrillers last week
[55:13.760 --> 55:18.560]  one of them was called numbers i think it's like we're there at work at the cia base in england but
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.480]  the point is and i was watching another one half asleep that's what i remember the name of it my
[55:22.480 --> 55:27.280]  wife was watching another one another night and it's like the cia goes in a house and kills you
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.360]  know the former cia guy and goes ahead and just shoots their daughter while they're at it and
[55:31.360 --> 55:36.240]  that's okay that's a good thing to do we got to kill their family it's collateral damage they're
[55:36.240 --> 55:43.360]  warping everybody's brains with these shows and that's why the cops all the time you see in the
[55:43.360 --> 55:48.240]  news going to house even the wrong house and say get in a fetal position to the naked guy out of his
[55:48.240 --> 55:54.560]  bed now crawl to us and then they taser them and rubber bullet them for fun and i've seen the videos
[55:54.560 --> 55:59.200]  of police laughing about it did you see how i shot that lady with the sign in the face of rubber
[55:59.200 --> 56:07.120]  bullets yes you have blood pouring on her nose you're gonna have your bank accounts taken to
[56:07.120 --> 56:12.320]  dumb dumb you're gonna be injected with cancer viruses dumb dumb you're not being given this
[56:12.320 --> 56:19.760]  power to abuse people for no reason evil is coming in and we need to wake up to it and say no and i
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.160]  don't mean to obsess on the police all day the point is that's where the rubber meets the road
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.920]  and i wish the police would try to be more like firefighters and and act like that i mean i guarantee
[56:31.920 --> 56:38.640]  you folks if i went and saw a group of firefighters being trained at the local pool at deep eddie that
[56:38.640 --> 56:46.320]  i bet they could all swim you don't know how bizarre it is to see the police and most of them were
[56:46.320 --> 56:50.720]  horrible swimmers and some of them had to be fished out and couldn't swim couldn't tread water for five
[56:50.720 --> 56:57.280]  minutes like children gooping and drown i mean it's just mindless i don't mean to go off into a
[56:57.280 --> 57:04.640]  jag it's just so pathetic coming up after i take some phone calls analysts george zemmerman probably
[57:04.640 --> 57:09.040]  won't be convicted of murder of manslaughter here's why and i agree they have a very bad case
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.560]  and there's there's there's there's reasonable doubt that he's guilty i think he was stupid to go
[57:14.560 --> 57:19.520]  following somebody around with a gun unless he saw him committing a crime and that's a different subject
[57:21.840 --> 57:29.920]  george zemmerman is probably an out of control cop wannabe type turns out most of his family and
[57:29.920 --> 57:36.240]  friends are cops i don't know why didn't try to go get on their department but the point is is that
[57:36.240 --> 57:42.800]  he was clearly jumped on top of and beat up and now threats to riot loot if zemmerman found innocent
[57:42.800 --> 57:49.040]  intensify it is thousands of tweets without even looking that people where they're gonna attack
[57:49.040 --> 57:57.280]  what they're gonna burn down all racially organized basically and it is really really sad you know
[57:57.280 --> 58:03.040]  why don't we all get together and get angry and and march against cancer viruses and vaccines
[58:03.040 --> 58:07.520]  oh no no no jesse jackson doesn't support that why don't we all march by the millions for the
[58:07.520 --> 58:12.080]  unborn children getting chopped up where we know they're innocent and it's wrong oh no it's too much
[58:12.080 --> 58:16.240]  fun to notice how the justice department kept calling zemmerman white the guy looks like kim
[58:16.240 --> 58:24.800]  jung unto me nothing against asians or anything but i mean you know i mean what is this whole deal
[58:24.800 --> 58:31.040]  what all right ladies and gentlemen we're gonna be right back take a few phone calls liberal bill

[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:43.680]  a bunch of other news that we're going to be uh discussing uh here today but i wanted to play
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:48.160]  this for larry pratt everybody else out there watching or listening radio listeners can go
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:56.080]  to info wars dot com and the title of the video is new gun show exposes joe biden as a fraud and
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.640]  i'm going to tweak that out on real alex jones uh while larry pratt is talking here in a moment
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.640]  if you want to find the link that way follow us there uh at twitter this is just a few minutes
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.600]  from the 15 minute shooting show we did and what we do is we do shooting shows we do entertainment
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:16.320]  reviews you name it to get mainstream people into the liberty movement now that the youtube stuff
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:22.320]  is is kind of our outreach prison planet dot tv's for our hardcore supporters and here's just a
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.560]  short clip i wanted to get larry's take on first because this video went viral a few months ago so
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:34.240]  we incorporated it in where biden says don't get a shotgun uh or i just had a Freudian slip
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.360]  until you're not a use guns right i wouldn't get a 12 game shotgun i don't think it kicks much but for
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:45.520]  new people it does get something like an ar-15 they're one of the easiest to use you know m4 type
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:52.720]  a 223 platforms and women children men you name it it's a great firearm well biden says don't get
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:58.080]  that he says get a shotgun go out and commit a felony just fire it off your front porch at somebody
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:04.640]  so let's go to that clip showing uh a nine-year-old first time he shot an ar-15 at about 100 yards
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:12.320]  hitting bullseye every time here it is nephew my brother's son rocker and uh he's been dying to
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.840]  to do some shooting and uh we thought it'd be like a little much for him to climb behind the 50 cal
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:25.840]  but we had a 223 and and uh we let him let him loose on that and uh he uh he had a pretty good shot
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.920]  vice president biden told women not to get a 223 rifle that it was too much for them to handle
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.360]  he said instead to get a 12 gauge shotgun if you want to protect yourself get a double barrel shot
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.960]  as you can see here it's not the best gun for beginners put that double barrel shotgun and
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:57.520]  fire two blasts here you see how 223 is perfect for children and women you don't need an ar-15
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:04.960]  it's harder to aim it's harder to use
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:11.840]  nine-year-old rocker was hitting bullseyes from the start with the 223 ar-15
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:18.480]  one of the things that i was shocked about oh that's good that full 15 minute video
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.280]  premiered over the weekend on prismplanet.tv it's now up on info wars.com for the full radio
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.320]  audience if you want to go see it but it shows women where people as a joke give them a 12 gauge
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.280]  the first time they shoot it and they don't know to pull it into their shoulder uh so they leave
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:38.240]  some space and it knocks them over imagine telling beginners go buy a 12 gauge go fire it out your
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.400]  front door that's what you do when there's a problem the exact opposite of what you do the
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:48.640]  exact type of gun to beginner once i would get something like a you know 223 single shot or
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.560]  something for a beginner or a 22 then after that graduate on but i'm going to shut up and go to
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.040]  larry prat larry you know you've seen that viral video so we've we've put it out in context with
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:04.160]  a child i think it's important to get this video and continue to show what a fraud joe bideness larry
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:09.600]  what's your take on that yes sir i can hear you you hear me yes sir you hear me oh good okay
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:18.160]  we're cooking yeah that is uh just a fabulous video and it it shows just how impervious to new
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:25.520]  information a liberal ideologue is i've talked to people who tried to explain to the vice president
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:32.640]  and uh sir um it's not exactly the way you were saying that uh actually said you know just like
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.160]  your video showed and if you want to get yourself flat on your back just pick up a shotgun and use
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:45.040]  it without any instruction whatsoever and meanwhile uh in the one that i saw a lady with her hearing
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:56.880]  muffs on is very controlled uh firing at a target boom boom boom boom no problem whatsoever but the
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:04.480]  vice president knows everything so how could we tell him anything the guy i thought kind of showed
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:12.000]  us the liberal mind and all that it is in this particular episode where it is so demonstrable
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.200]  we're not talking about whether kanesian economics in 20 years is going to ruin the country
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:22.720]  and we're talking about what's going to happen in the next 20 seconds exactly and you know i've
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:27.360]  grown up obviously born in texas been around a lot of what i would just call good old-fashioned
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:34.960]  populist uh type people larry but libertarians conservatives they may be wrong on some issues
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.120]  sometimes but they'll come over and help you fix your truck or fix your tractor they'll come over
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.560]  they know how to fix the air conditioner they'll come over and help you carry your groceries in
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.800]  and they want help too and and and they'll help somebody that's choking and they'll help somebody
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:51.840]  on the side of the road and they'll stand up so-called liberals i've noticed will just sit there
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:57.920]  and say call 911 call 911 if somebody's being assaulted or somebody's choking i've seen it
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:04.160]  they're not really liberals they are domesticated idiots consistent with what you're saying studies
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:10.240]  of giving patterns of people in different states show that the the more conservative of the states
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:17.440]  are the places where more is given to private charity where people obviously assume that they're
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:23.040]  responsible for helping their fellow citizen and they're they're not leaving it all to the government
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:30.240]  whereas as you say the 911 mentality is just leave it all to the government a friend of gun owners
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:39.520]  of america has been a town hall columnist and my mind has just dropped his name right off the
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:44.560]  train it's okay tell the story he's a professor down in the university of north carolina and he
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:52.960]  started out as a 100 down the line liberal and then a couple that he knew was murdered i think in
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.360]  their car alongside a roadway and he would go by that point every day and couldn't help but remember
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:05.600]  that that's where they died and of course they didn't have a gun he and he knew that well he finally
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:12.640]  got a gun and for kind of the right reason you know protect himself and once he did that he was
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:19.840]  on his way to becoming a conservative and when i talked to him one time about his book that he
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:26.560]  had written he said you know you're right i hadn't thought of it that way but once i took responsibility
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:34.080]  for my own protection the most important thing that is in my life my life itself then i began to
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.240]  question why all these other government programs if i can take care of myself and if i should
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:45.840]  take care of myself then what's with all this government welfare stuff and all the control
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.720]  that comes with it and biden knows what he's doing consciously we may be winning the culture war
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.760]  for liberty in many respects and obama cares in trouble and their open border plan is in trouble
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.600]  some really good news we can now announce to people but the problem is they're winning the
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:05.920]  slow war of domestication 101 million americans according to the department of labor uh and
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:12.000]  statistics are now getting food aid from the government more people than are in the private
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.040]  workforce that's right mike adams by the way as the professor i was trying to come up with a name
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:23.680]  for and one of the things that we want to do here at gun owners of america more consistently we have
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:30.560]  access to some rural acreage not far from the gun owners of america office and we're going to
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:37.760]  start taking staffers out we found that even sometimes conservative christian men and women
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:42.960]  are all confused about the second amendment and that's why i like the apple seed project just
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:49.040]  like the globalists try to recruit into collectivism we have to recruit into liberty i think that's
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.720]  the ticket and what they're doing in that apple seed project is terrific and i guess uh you might
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:00.800]  say we're going to be uh the capital hill apple seed project and i think it's going to pay some
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:08.480]  dividends because we've seen it uh professor adams was a very conspicuous case of when somebody
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.040]  finally learns that guns uh there's a right end and a wrong end of a gun and when you know how
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.600]  to handle the right end of the gun it's not such a big deal uh obviously you use common sense you
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:24.720]  demystify it now now expanding here in the time we've got with you shifting gears what's going on
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:30.160]  with the un gun treaty obama saying he's going to sign it even if the senate doesn't ratify it and
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:35.440]  even mainstream media goes can he do that is that dictatorial well that's like asking you know it
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.840]  does the fish swim in the ocean of course it's dictatorial well he can sign it that's what would
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.600]  have to be done before he can refer it to the senate but that's where even democrat senators
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:51.280]  are going to look at that puppy and say that doesn't hunt here uh they they're they they
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:58.640]  un is not popular gun control is not popular that's unpopularity squared no i know but he's had uh
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.640]  his chief brainwasher in his own words the attorney general has said that we're going to try to do
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:11.600]  this even if they don't ratify it as my point that's where i think we need to be very alert what we've
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:18.960]  seen happen even under the clinton administration was a new age gold mine in wyoming outside of
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:30.160]  the national park there and when they applied to start mining activity they went through something
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.920]  like three million dollars worth of permits and inspections and they were just about on the verge
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:42.960]  of mining again uh like three miles from old yellowstone park and the clinton bureaucrats
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:50.640]  went running up to the un and had the un declare the the the park world heritage yeah world heritage
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:58.800]  park and no mining within a hundred miles took care of that mine and i can see something similar
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:05.360]  being done with either this administration or god forbid a future obama type administration
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:14.080]  somehow legislating through the un saying well we got to comply with the the world law because
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:21.280]  we are good world citizens well that's the real danger and i think if the president does sign it
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:28.000]  if we ever do get an uh an american as president again we ought to have him un sign it and send it
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.960]  back where it came from sure well it's like the carbon taxes congress voted that down almost
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:39.200]  four years ago and obama just used a regulation on microwaves to add a line in there about increasing
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:45.280]  the cost of carbon and now he says he's going to do other uh executive actions he can't do that
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:52.240]  he he can't implement parts of obama care uh executively it's unconstitutional what's going
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:21:00.160]  on with congress when this guy is such a lame duck has no political power uh in the last vestiges
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:04.720]  of capital he had politically or draining out of him i mean isn't it time to really go after him
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:10.560]  politically or will congress just sit there and let him run over him so far the latter seems to be
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:18.800]  the case uh john bainer the speaker has it well within his ability and power to tell the president
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:24.320]  we're just not going to send you any money for enforcing unconstitutional gun control for
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:32.000]  implementing a un treaty or even signing a un treaty uh we're not going to do any of that and
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.960]  yet um they just sit around and say well what can we do we can't see they they will tell us if we
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:45.680]  tell them we want you to stop obama care we want you to cut the funding and just kill it do a and
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:51.120]  they will say well but then the president would allow the government to be shut down well because
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:58.000]  there wouldn't be a budget or there wouldn't even be a continuing resolution well you know if nothing
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.440]  happens to increase spending uh to pay for the current uh excessive spending the taxes that come
[01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:12.080]  in on a monthly basis would run 57 percent of the federal government which is still way too much
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:17.200]  it would pay for all the social security and medicare payments so all of those that are depending
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:22.640]  on those federal funds would still be getting those federal funds but what it might mean is
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.760]  that some of the bureaucrats inside the beltway uh would be furloughed without paying well that's
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.720]  the larger problem and and and they're there lobbying to keep this going but we're already
[01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:38.240]  bankrupt we can't let them continue to bankrupt us they hope through that emergency to then
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.680]  collectivize the country uh and i think a lot of the so-called libertarians that are in congress
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:49.520]  are scared of the dinosaur media but you notice that joe biden and obama when speaking to contributors
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.960]  these tapes have come out in the last month i want to get your take on that before getting back into
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.880]  guns specifically and where the future attack on that front's going with the head of governors of
[01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:03.600]  america larry pratt joining us on this monday edition is that they attack ted cruise and ran paul
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.400]  and say these guys are dangerous we've got to shoot them down politically they're extremist
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:13.920]  because they know if real libertarian constitutional conservatism americana
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.280]  ever takes root which it's starting to do you even see carl roe of attacking real conservatives
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:26.480]  and libertarians with the rhinos they're desperate in 2014 that of the campaign for liberty types
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:31.760]  get a stronger foothold we could reverse all this that's why the whole left the collectivist
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.040]  the establishment republicans are pulling out all the stops because what ran paul and ted
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:43.680]  cruiser doing will defeat these people your take on that i couldn't agree more those are two of the
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:49.120]  nicest things to have happened to the united states senate in a long time and when john
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:58.000]  mccain aka mcluzer accused senator cruz of being a wacko bird cruz went right back in his face and
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.520]  said well if it means being for limited government uh hearing to the constitution and he ran off a
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:10.560]  number of things said well then please call me a wacko bird uh his willingness to get into a scrap
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:16.240]  not only willing i think he came here looking for trouble because he he's not stupid that's the only
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:20.480]  way you stand out and make change they're always saying don't be loud don't be aggressive that's
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.600]  bull they have bullied us long enough one of my favorites uh about senator cruz in the short time
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.080]  he's been here on the judiciary committee they were considering the gun control bill that they
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:40.240]  put out for a vote that happily lost and diane feinstein wanted to ban some guns and his question
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:45.760]  to her was well i wonder if the senior senator from california could tell me that if her view
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.320]  that the second amendment only protects certain guns would also then correspond to the first
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:57.840]  amendment only protecting certain speech and the fourth amendment only protecting certain
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:05.920]  houses sure she went bananas and she accused him of calling her a sixth grader which i thought would
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:12.560]  be an insult to sixth graders so i'm sure senator oh he was so polite and calm exactly with exactly
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.080]  with the logic that's why that witch got so upset shifting gears again i know you've seen a story
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.880]  about atf arming robbers in hatch plots that they create themselves similar to fashion furious this
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.960]  came out in local abc news channels and a few others but hasn't gotten any attention uh what's
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:36.400]  going on with fashion furious and other atf scandals and then what is their newest plan to go after
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:43.840]  our guns well two more uh mexicans have been murdered by thugs using a fast and furious gun
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:50.800]  in this case it was a i believe it was a police chief of a mexican town and hit or a mayor and
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:59.040]  his bodyguard and um wife of the guy was wounded and it just goes on and on and nothing is going
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:06.000]  to be done because we don't really expect eric holder to prosecute eric holder what is concerning
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:13.120]  me is that the house of representatives in a vote for criminal contempt sent that vote that
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:18.960]  approval of that resolution over to the federal court for the district of columbia and essentially
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:24.960]  became the prosecutor against the underlings of eric holder that and eric holder that had been
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:33.360]  caught in outright lies under oath and said we want these people prosecuted the court i understood
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.280]  before the election they weren't going to do anything but now it's been over six months and
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:43.360]  they still haven't done anything clearly the washington establishment is not going to do
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:49.440]  anything to anybody that even gets involved in complicity to commit murder which is what fast
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:56.640]  and furious was from the get go the intention was not to track guns we know from what whistleblowers
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.960]  have told us the intention was always to make it look like folks like you and me are the bad guys
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:08.560]  because we own guns sure that came out the cbs's credit they got the internal memos that was to
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.200]  be blamed on the second amendment a false flag we've only got three minutes left with larry
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.560]  pratt we're going to break and come back with your calls i've been asking a lot of the questions
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.680]  here what else do you want to tell people about and alert people about uh that's going on we've
[01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:27.040]  got california saying got to get insurance or background checks to get bullets you've got
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:33.600]  all this stuff happening what else is on the radar well i've got our attorneys studying the proposition
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:39.520]  what would happen if a bunch of guys my age or somewhat younger went on to a school ground at
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:45.440]  lunchtime when probably everybody pretty much is outside and started playing cops and robbers with
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:51.920]  our fingers and our pop carts and i suppose we could get charged with trespassing but i'd like
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:59.520]  to know exactly what might be the result of of that because we need to educate children that a gun
[01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:06.240]  in a hand of somebody besides a police officer is not a bad thing when that kid in west virginia
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:16.080]  was put in a whole heap of trouble jared markham for having defend the right nr a defend the right
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.680]  and showed a picture of truly a hunting rifle it was not even and they arrested him they arrested the
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:28.160]  kid uh it was a most amazing ordeal happily we were able to get involved with our foundation
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:35.280]  and i think that had some effect on bringing some reason to these people and having the prosecutor
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.520]  dropped the case when he was going ahead with it again we've just got to come in gunners of america
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:43.760]  for what you're doing so what you're saying is get on the offense culturally because they've
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:48.720]  got the kids in their clutches right now teaching them that that even the image of a gun's illegal
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:56.560]  even the image uh so i think we have to push back in whatever smart way we can do to make
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.200]  sure that kids see that yeah having a gun is just as much fun as you thought it was when you were
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.320]  shooting your buddy with a water pistol yesterday uh it's not a bad thing i tell you what's fun
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.400]  about it is having low crime and sleeping good at night yeah that kind of beats living in detroit

[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:16.720]  creating a north american union we're beating them on their attempt to take our guns we are
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:22.720]  beating them on so many fronts and we will abolish the offshore federal reserve we will
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.440]  kick the Rothschilds and Rockefellers out of this country out of our banking system we will restore
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:32.240]  the republic now we're going to go to your phone calls here in a few minutes adam kokeshi is on
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:39.440]  now and this happened on the 4th of july he went ahead with his armed march on dc there between
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.040]  the capital and the white house got out there in the morning loaded the shotgun up in his words
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:50.960]  and a text to me saying he committed four felonies the issue here is the supreme court five years ago
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:58.240]  overthrew the ban on shotguns and handguns for citizens but just like courts have ordered fast
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:03.920]  and furious of the justice department to answer questions they haven't done it in several years
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:09.680]  and now in the latest ruling six months they are lawless this is like roose park saying i'm not
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:13.680]  going to sit at the back of the bus anymore i'm going to sit up at the front with the air condition
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:19.760]  that is because i'm black doesn't mean i'm a second class citizen and dc the government has
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:24.400]  its guns it's got its helicopters and rocket launchers but you can't have a gun so you can live
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.320]  in one of the highest crime rates in the country just like chicago where they've taken the citizens
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.480]  guns and so he sent me a text right after it went live i mean he sent me the text i looked at it had
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:38.000]  like 20 views on youtube when he sent it to me i saw it that morning i called him and he said i'm
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.240]  not ready to come on right now i'll talk to you next week so he's giving us the first interview
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:47.360]  right now and you could say what you want about him but he's going straight into the wind on this
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.680]  and that's how you make history uh he's not closing his eyes in the face of adversity
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:58.560]  and he is standing up for our civil and god given and just unalienable unalienable
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:04.080]  basic human rights and it's easy to say you know should he do an arm march should he do
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:08.480]  an arm march shouldn't he the point is you have a right you can debate whether it's a good idea or
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:14.800]  a bad idea but you cannot debate that he has courage and he has a right to do it the question is
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.360]  is now the time to call these people on their criminality i think that's open for debate but
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:25.600]  adam has caused a debate as i said friday would you card jackson and has contributed to it and
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:33.040]  and our listeners have contributed as well uh to coming to that clarion call of a new paul revere
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:38.240]  all of us are paul revere's of every race color creed sex you name it there were marches in all
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:42.960]  50 states some of them had thousands of people i think conservatively there were probably 800
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:48.320]  people from the news report jacari jackson filed the texas capital and it was the impetus the idea
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:54.080]  of adam kokesh on the fourth to march for the second amendment that then even turned into an
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:00.320]  nsa protest in many states so big big things have small beginnings let's go to this clip
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:05.440]  of his civil disobedience against the incredible tyranny of the foreign banks that have occupied
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:15.200]  dc here it is we will not be silent we will not obey we will not allow our government to destroy
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.640]  our humanity we are
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:30.240]  the final american revolution see you next independence day i love the name of the square
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.360]  where he did this too to point out the orwellian bizarreness of this uh adam thank you for coming
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.480]  on with us it's been about four days since you did this and for those that live in freer areas it
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.200]  doesn't seem like a big deal more door has announced they're planning to come after you it's been a
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:51.120]  big national story thank you for joining us tell us uh the details where this is going well alex i
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.960]  really appreciate that introduction it's my pleasure to come on this is the first formal
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:01.120]  interview that i've done since the event and i'm more than happy to give this to you first because
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:07.120]  you've you've been so supportive in this but i want to draw a comparison with rosa parks as you
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:13.200]  have and i'm greatly honored by that and the significance of her single act of civil disobedience
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.640]  uh really can't be measured and and and i hope that that in my lifetime i might have a similar
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.880]  impact but you also made the comparison to paul revere so if i may the events that that took
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.960]  place this past independence day with as you pointed out thousands marching throughout the country
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:34.640]  uh world about a lot more than the second amendment or the fourth amendment or the nsa or gun rights
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:39.200]  in general it was very specifically a call to overthrow the united states federal government
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:43.680]  and i think that we have come to the point where we can get a critical mass of americans to realize
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:48.640]  that we'd be better off without it than with it and rosa parks when she went to the front of the
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:54.240]  bus it wasn't well i think the government should be able to to say who should be able to sit at
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.400]  the front of the bus but it should only be white people and black people screw yellow people and
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:03.680]  red people and forget about them no it was we are independent human beings and we have inherent
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:08.640]  rights based on that that are absolutely universal and i know that you're very well committed to that
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:14.400]  cause but similarly with paul revere if you want to take take the call that i'm putting out for this
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:18.400]  it's not to restore the republic and and i feel like i have a much more important mission right
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.840]  now during this interview with you today sir uh than than to spread the message about what what
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.800]  happened on independence day but to convince you of the appropriate course of action moving for
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.120]  because your audience and yourself have so much respect and and carry so much power in this united
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.040]  states national conversation right now and if if we say well we have these rights but we're
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.200]  going to restore the republic we're going to be repeating the mistakes of the past by creating
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:50.000]  a central authority that is based on democratic concepts i listen listen i i want to get into
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:56.240]  that with you and i want you to be able to say your piece but for me and i've had a lot of
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:01.600]  constitutional lawyers like ebb and veera and countless others on who who who agree that what
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:06.640]  i'm saying is how the declaration of independence bill of rights and constitution we don't even
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.960]  have a federal government it's a foreign banking cartel and if we point that out then it's totally
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:19.120]  illegitimate and people get it and i think it's going to be easier to at least restore the classic
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:24.320]  republic that's a million times better than the new world order we've got than just saying let's
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.720]  overthrow the federal government it's not even the federal government the federal reserve is not
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.560]  federal this is an alien globalist corporate kleptocracy in europe they brag that private
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.440]  banks have seized the countries so my issue is i support you defending the individual right to
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.240]  bear arms but i'm even giving you the legal argument the way that you probably went in
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.400]  court if they come after you instead of just saying i see you all as illegitimate criminals
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:54.800]  i i respect what you're saying i respect the whole and you know uh the anarchic capitalist
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:01.520]  hyper libertarian whatever you want to call yourself view i get that i'm simply saying that
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.520]  that that i think you have a lot of courage this is a you know overall a very positive thing you
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.680]  did it was your individual choice it didn't endanger a whole bunch of other people so i
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:14.480]  wanted to speak specifically about that and then you can give us your view but when you say a
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:20.000]  revolution i want to have a psychological uh cultural revolution against the globalist
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.040]  so first first define your revolution and what you're saying and then let's get back to you
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.800]  locking and loading uh with the 12 gauge there in dc sure alex i appreciate that and and the the
[01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:34.880]  revolution in the bigger picture in the longer term i'm absolutely with you it's the paradigm
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:39.760]  shift it's the it's not the revolution it's the evolution that people are going through of realizing
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:44.400]  that they have these rights but the american founders would would you be the one telling them oh
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:49.040]  you shouldn't really shoot back at the king's soldiers you should go send an emissary to king
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  george and plead in his court for forgiveness and and you should plead for independence no the time
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:00.560]  then was to take a specific radical action and it fortunately this day and age violence is not
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:05.360]  required to achieve that but we're not going to achieve this through democracy through the voting
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:10.480]  process through the court well i'll tell you this if we saw if we saw 20-something governors and former
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:17.920]  senators and ron paul and people i respect meeting in public like in philadelphia again
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:22.240]  and then i heard ideas and saw plans that were sent to the states you got to have some organization
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.640]  well no let me ask you a question alex because you talk about these rights and it's very important
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:31.120]  to understand what these rights are and again going back to roza parks which she was protesting for
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:37.680]  was not for specific privileges under an existing system she was protesting for rights and that's
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:44.400]  what i'm talking about here you don't have a right under any system in in the world to choose a leader
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.600]  for anyone else that is fundamentally immoral that is what the real immediate revolution that is
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:53.760]  happening no i get it this is a total this is one you want to restore the republic you're still
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:58.880]  going to have other people choosing a leader for me and i reject that but i see this in steps i want
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:04.160]  to kick the new world order out and expose their eugenics agenda and bring them to justice and then
[01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:10.400]  out of that great victory we could build an open more free society okay so i i agree with a lot of
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:15.680]  your basic ideas and a lot of the you know hyper libertarian ideas that i think were expressed
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:22.080]  by thomas jefferson more eloquently than i can do 200 plus years ago i'm saying the globalist
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:29.360]  actually like revolutions because they could steer them into larger crises and and that's why i think
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:35.360]  people have reputation that's why specifically the what what we are calling for here is an orderly
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:40.960]  peaceful disillusion of the federal government not not anything chaotic which is what we face if we
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.000]  don't do anything or if we take these half measures and with all due respect sir i believe that what
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.080]  you're calling for is the definition of insanity of trying the same thing over and expecting
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:54.880]  different results and we can't fight inch by inch anymore because you take an inch and they're going
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:59.280]  to take a mile behind your back and laugh at you while they're doing it and we have to get a critical
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.640]  mass of public support on our side and you're not going to get a critical mass of public support
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.280]  saying well let's change this law or let's tweak this well i'll say this i know a lot of government
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:15.920]  people that that that want to have some big showdown and i historically we're winning in the
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:22.720]  awakening process and and i i think this baby is five months pregnant my gut tells me and people
[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:27.280]  say oh you just say that because you're a popular talk show host and have stuff to lose that's not
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:31.920]  true folks i go out and give speeches to thousands of people without bodyguards i'm out in the open
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.120]  i just just i mean you're saying let's have the revolution they're all set up to try to have a
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:43.920]  civil war instead of a restoration of any type of freedom and i believe the the the the system of
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:50.080]  the declaration of independence that says it's our right it's our duty to abolish forms that are
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.720]  abusive and set up new ones obviously if we've got 101 million people on on welfare in the us right
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:01.840]  now these people don't even know how to wipe their own hind ends much less live in the society you're
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:07.520]  talking about it's like ron paul said america is an a coma it's going to take time to get us out of
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:12.560]  this well in a sense i feel like i'm the moderate here because what i'm suggesting is that we maintain
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:18.000]  the state governments as they are and what i'm suggesting specifically as a form for this revolution
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.880]  this specific step that i think we can demand that i think we can get a critical mass of people from
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:29.840]  behind is to restore the authority of the states to go back to having independent truly autonomous
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:34.480]  states and this is something that can really unite people see there's a problem alex when you say
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.800]  let's have a republic let's restore the republic let's have this vision on the national level
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.760]  it's one person's specific particular vision and if a lot of people share it fine but it's going to
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.880]  be forced on the entire country but if you if you break it down at the state level you can tell
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.960]  everyone no that's what i called for last year i said i called for a new continental congress
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:58.560]  and the states to decide what we want to do and i believe the best course would be a re upload of
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:04.240]  the republic cutting the federal government by about 97 percent why stop there why would you
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:10.080]  cut a cancer out and leave three percent to grow back because it's not the cancer the globalist came
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.400]  and took it over people blame the republic for what's there that's not a republic that's a un
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:21.920]  globalist fortress if you leave three percent the same forces will be there to take advantage of it
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.160]  and grow it back into a force but you need a balance of the two sides against each other
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:31.200]  separation of powers they will also go into the states and take those over the balance of power
[01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:35.920]  is that we fill the vacuum with self-governance and that's the paradigm shift that's where that
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:41.280]  comes in sir where people are able to say i am a free beautiful independent human being i'm not
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.760]  going to allow you know but when we have this level of domestication when we have this level
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:50.480]  of domestication 101 million people they've gotten us dependent so that it'll be almost
[01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:55.200]  impossible to get off of it i agree it's like we're a heroin addict but can we go cold turkey is
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.720]  what i'm asking you i think there are a lot of people who are still going to be dependent on
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:02.320]  the state governments after what i'm suggesting the only people i want to pull the rug out from
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.440]  underneath is the nsa and the irs and a few other absolutely destructive well they're foreign agents
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.760]  their leadership does need to be arrested absolutely absolutely and and if we pull the rug out from
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:16.080]  underneath them i have no problem with that but i'm not talking about a change in the actual
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:20.480]  mechanisms of governance we'd still be living under state governments that provide the what you
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.120]  know illusion of stability that you're talking about that would give the sheep if you will
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.200]  that comfort and that protection but they would see it on a much less corrupt on a much more
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.880]  local level where they have the ability to change and if one state fell to tyranny you can run to
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:37.440]  another absolutely yeah that's the problem of global government is it's one giant ring ruling
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:42.160]  the mall that's the question which direction do you want to go and serve greater concentrations of
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:47.120]  power or lower do you want to bring it back to the individual and if we go in that direction
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.680]  compromise in in in attempt i want to take the federal government back over and i want to bring
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:55.760]  the people to justice that have taken the country over believe me that'll send a very strong message
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:00.400]  well i'm i'm a little as much as i share your passion for that justice i'm more concerned with
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:05.040]  the progress that we need to make right now as a species and get past this idea of central authority
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:10.160]  in the first place but if you compromise in in in uh you know in the short term you're going to get
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:14.080]  uh you know when all right listen listen you did the provocative loading the shotgun you have a
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.400]  lot of courage down there i understand you want to be smart and leave it nebulous for legal reasons
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.120]  but we got you on to talk about that specifically uh i mean talk about why you decided to do it
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:26.560]  because some will try to say it's a blue screen does not look like a blue screen to me you can
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:32.080]  hear the birds tweeting and the wind blowing on the microphone uh i mean if it is fake you had
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:37.120]  stanley cubrick out there helping him well that might just be the case but no it was a real shotgun
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:42.400]  it was loaded and it was racked and and had a round in the chamber in freedom plaza in washington
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.280]  dc in between the white house and the capital and if anything i did it at this point simply for
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:51.360]  follow-through for the sake of my own credibility to show that i was willing to follow through
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.440]  with committing that particular act of civil disobedience on independence day and a lot of
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.280]  people didn't understand this a lot of people attacked me a lot of it was government trolls
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.680]  and we've seen the patterns of oh it's easy for people that are on the bench to criticize those
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.640]  in the arena of course and uh you i i'm sure you understand the the exact same thing from your
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.400]  personal experience but i want people to understand that this year we simply didn't have the numbers
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:19.520]  for the march to get a critical mass in dc and with my arrest on on may 18th in in philadelphia uh
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.400]  to have an event that was based on an open carry march crossing a border dependent on a single
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.360]  organizer was not wise and so for those reasons i decided to make it about the 50 state capitals
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:33.760]  instead and i appreciate your recap of that because it was an incredible success we still
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.840]  have videos coming in from all over the place but now it's time to plant the flag for next
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.000]  year and alex i know a lot of people in your audience will join us in this and i hope you
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.920]  will endorse it too because it's going to happen with or without me now when we invite anybody
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:51.440]  to join us who for whatever reason wants to end the fed entirely to join us on independence
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:55.920]  save next year we're going to be doing the same route from arlington cemetery across memorial
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.440]  bridge down independence avenue around the capital and the supreme court up pennsylvania avenue
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:06.000]  around the white house back down constitution avenue but this time it's not about guns and it
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.240]  really wasn't ever about guns as much as it was about the monopoly of force that the government
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:14.880]  has over the citizens and wanting to put it in its place but now it's time to build this critical
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.600]  mass and i appreciate the opportunity to make this pitch and appeal to you and your audience
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:23.280]  because i know a lot of people in your audience are with me on this point philosophically and
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:27.760]  tactically that it's time to say let's end the federal government let's call for nothing less
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.240]  let's hear you i just think you do it a favor calling it the federal government it really is
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:40.000]  a foreign alien banking combine fair enough i mean it i just i just want to try to get america reason
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.040]  to not compromise all the more reason to give no quarter all the more reason to take it down
[01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:50.480]  to zero percent all right adam versus the man dot com adam kokesh thank you so much for spending

[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:43.760]  ancient times got a bunch of armed people together and they took over and said everybody had to

[02:01:53.920 --> 02:02:00.160]  jason well the bottom line is this you just got a young 20-something year old kid who's being
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:07.040]  pumped up with this propaganda and he actually believes it and he just it it's like you said
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:13.360]  this weekend i can't be mad at him i'm sad for him it hurts he thinks he's serving christ and he's not
[02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:19.360]  well i mean i i've done a lot of things when i was 22 23 20 i was already on the air but i had a
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:26.160]  pretty wild seen a lot of things but i would still be it's i would be nervous even if i was a good
[02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:31.200]  guy and it was a public safety issue to be pulling people over and writing tickets and deal i mean
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:36.320]  i get why they've got to get control freaks to do it because i wouldn't want to do that but i mean
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:40.720]  the way that you know they pull you over and you know you weren't speeding they want to search your
[02:02:40.720 --> 02:02:45.840]  car and you look and the guy even knows who you are and knows you're not you know and then the
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:53.040]  government is shipping the drugs in and you're being cased basically by the state police and and
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:59.840]  to see the conversion everybody sees this and the good news is i see people waking up did you
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.520]  say anything to him when he was strutting around uh of course not i mean i just sat there and

[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:47.600]  when when moracy people uh are being killed we covered it but when it's al-qaeda killing
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:51.920]  people over there for no reason our media will not pick it up but but we've been covering
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:57.760]  because that's the group our government is supporting absolutely absolutely outrageous
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.720]  let's go ahead and talk to ryan in wisconsin thanks for holding ryan you're on the air
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:12.880]  hey alec i just uh wanted to comment real quick on um well mr go catch i i think he's uh
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:21.120]  directly on the target so to speak i i think uh yeah he has it's trouble so much flows i mean
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:28.400]  if things were to ignite they would definitely try to uh use that against um the movement as far as
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:34.560]  gun control and and the rights to bear arms but um you know it's like gerald colincy though said
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:40.720]  20 of the people they come together that's all we we realistically need in order to uh make things
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:48.800]  happen 20 of the american people um and you know i think that a lot of the uh the liberal side
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:54.400]  unfortunately i live in madison wisconsin right now and i'm actually from colorado so i'm very
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:12:00.560]  familiar with liberal ideology i speak with a lot of people that have that kind of academia
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:08.560]  mindset and uh yeah they think they're right on pretty much every level but um when it comes to guns
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:15.360]  and uh you know they all seem to uh have that same idea or understanding that it's just not worth it
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:19.520]  to uh to have guns and go to that length and they don't they don't quite understand they're not
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:26.320]  quite they're not putting the pieces together but i think liberal uh liberals have had a lot
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:33.040]  of traction in the political arena longer than the conservatives have as far as being active
[02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:43.040]  in politics so i think what uh would be great to see if uh adam kokesh could grab a lot of these
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:50.240]  and he does appear at least on the surface to be a lot like or he could easily grab a lot of those
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:57.200]  liberal thinking minds and pull them down into uh into where where we're at well i mean here's the
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:01.120]  issue yeah i don't think adam kokesh is a bad guy i think he's interesting i think he's smart
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:07.200]  but i he was phrasing it in the interview earlier like alex i don't know if you could speak for
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:15.440]  everybody and say that you want the revolution to be a restoration of our republic uh what we need
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:21.200]  is the states to be by themselves and it's like that's not even what i'm saying i'm giving
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:26.800]  my view that i think that's what we should do and really adam is kind of putting out
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:32.640]  his idea of leadership and then classically and i guess he did do psych warfare in the marines
[02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:39.680]  turning it around like i'm the one saying i'm the leader uh and and i mean that's fine he handles it
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:47.520]  all deftly he goes and does these pr events and then i'm getting him on about one thing about what
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:52.160]  he did down there and he confirmed he did do it and then it turns into his idea for next year
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:57.840]  which is fine i'd have him on to promote ideas i mean i i think we should all promote uh july
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:04.240]  4th marches about whatever issue it is that you're concerned with um so i'm not criticizing adam i'm
[02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:09.120]  just aware of what he's doing when he's on air i don't sit here and really come up with a plan
[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:14.320]  of what i'm gonna say i know the info i've done the research and it's really just from my heart
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:23.280]  and my gut tells me that we're not going to get and then i'm not even sure i want a total
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:28.000]  end to the federal government at this stage of human development because there's all these other
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:33.360]  big governments that will come in and take us over that's the that's the necessary evil of
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:40.960]  some government our founders believed in 237 years ago or 236 years ago now do we really think we
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:46.800]  know more than men that actually want a revolution a good revolution one of the few times in history
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:50.720]  and beat the greatest empire the planet had ever seen and put everything on the line
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.760]  and actually executed it for seven and a half years and get it and then built the country that
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:00.960]  became the freest and the wealthiest the world's ever seen and now has been infested by criminals
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:07.600]  because we were the shining city on the hill and i'm just i'm telling you i've actually read the
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:14.800]  writings of george washington thomas jefferson thomas pain all of them that we've got a quote
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:19.760]  up on info wars dot com about one of the founders up there about government and it's the means of
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:25.760]  defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:33.280]  that was james madison so i get adam's point about uh if you build uh some you know huge
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:41.200]  giant overreaching overarching thing to defend against a great enemy overseas the domestic
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.760]  system you set up for it will just become what it was originally fighting and that's the nature of
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:51.120]  power that's why the police are getting more and more imperious more and more arrogant more and
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:59.040]  more power grabbing it's a it's a it's a revolt of the of the the bureaucrats the judges the power
[02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:05.200]  structure as they get bigger pensions and as they get bigger raises and as they get more power and
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.160]  as they all get together and kind of a mafia psychology and hype each other up that what
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:18.480]  they're doing is okay so i fully understand it and i understand the dangers though in trying
[02:16:18.480 --> 02:16:27.600]  to be transported directly to some libertarian heaven some anarchic capitalist valhalla up there
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:34.240]  with thor and odin and the tree of life and ragnarok and gutter damarang i just don't see that
[02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:40.000]  happening i'm trying to desperately beat them getting all our guns i'm trying to desperately beat
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.560]  them kidnapping people's kids in mass i mean look i want adam could catch talk about fluoride the
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:51.520]  water and and and and i mean if somebody called for a revolution to go start arresting these
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:55.520]  health department people with the proof bring it to the grand juries when they do nothing then take
[02:16:55.520 --> 02:17:00.640]  action that hey they're giving people cancer viruses in these particular shots here's the proof
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:05.600]  or hey we need to start you know suing and then if that doesn't work well you know whatever to
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:12.640]  stop them putting fluoride the water which they know is killing us see but oh you don't cover that
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:18.720]  is what the kooky right wingers talk about i mean this is so much bigger folks and incredibly complex
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:24.400]  and i eat drink and sleep the research of this but i appreciate your call ryan and so i'm i'm
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:31.360]  mainly allowed musing here musing allowed about this it's just he's like let's get rid of the fed
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:40.560]  it's not even the fed it's like the movie the thing from the 1980s where it looks like the federal
[02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:45.440]  government it doesn't really i mean it looks like nazi germany it looks like soviet russia it looks
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:51.600]  exactly like what it is a big fat out of control tyranny gearing up for all out takeover against us
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:57.920]  in a design collapse i mean we it's bad and so my point is there isn't even a federal government
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:05.040]  i mean you get this thing out of here get the national security state of 1947 when the private
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:09.920]  banks and the skull and bones group on record were able to set up the national security act
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:14.480]  where they get all the money all the secrecy licensed to kill whatever they want i say that's
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:19.520]  illegitimate i say they've robbed us blind i say being given the keys to the kingdom they
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:25.040]  abuse the hell out of this place and of course they have i mean it's totally illegitimate

[02:24:15.040 --> 02:24:19.760]  let me guess i stole your thunder the idea is for people need to put libertarian patriot
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:26.880]  anti-neural order type material in the libraries but i like my day uh even more of giving people
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:31.760]  a gift subscription a yearly subscription to info wars magazine the shipping's included
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:36.720]  its one time deal 12 of these will be delivered give it to the police department give it to the
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:42.400]  library give it to your state rep and then they will get 12 of these into their office and you
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:48.000]  have no idea how those messages in a bottle will affect things but go ahead john make your point
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.640]  yes and one of those seven libraries which does have the book and you can see it on the screen
[02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:57.680]  it's the library of the federal bureau of investigation academy so isn't that kind of
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:04.160]  like spooky or creepy to see right uh oh up there in the world's cat that the fbi is like spying on us
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:08.960]  if you talk about liberty you're evil
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:19.600]  yeah so what was the rest of your point yeah so it's kind of spooky when i type in world's cat
[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:26.080]  that are the resistive manifesto one of those seven libraries which does have the book is the fbi
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:31.520]  academy so it's kind of like creepy to like see the evidence right be up on the screen
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:36.080]  no see i thought i was stealing your thunder uh about what we should put books in libraries and
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:41.520]  now it was about something completely different sometimes i go off half cocked um but you know
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:45.200]  i think that's good i think they should know the truth that's a good book that mark wrote
[02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:50.720]  and i think it's you know we should all donate to the local fbi a yearly subscription
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:57.840]  to info wars magazine because we're not hiding we haven't done anything wrong we have a government
[02:25:57.840 --> 02:26:03.040]  that's completely out of control totally illegitimate that has been hijacked good to hear from you john
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:11.280]  and again you can get the july issue that has 10 bumper stickers in it at cost in groups of 10
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:16.880]  magazines up to 100 in bulk to give to friends and family or to leave in different public places
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:23.520]  or to give to your preacher i mean it's limitless or you can get a yearly subscription and this
[02:26:23.520 --> 02:26:29.280]  current issue has four big bumper stickers six medium size that say listen to alex jones in
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:35.040]  four wars dot com and it has the at symbol listen to alex jones at info wars dot com there's two of
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.880]  those there's another that says info wars dot com forbidden information and my favorite america
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:49.280]  has been occupied by globalist forces info wars dot com and then six medium size info wars dot
[02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:54.400]  com the average bumper sticker gets seen by thousands of people it results in hundreds of visits to
[02:26:54.400 --> 02:27:00.320]  the site imagine what you can do posting these in legal and lawful areas because the last thing you
[02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:05.040]  want to do is put post these in public like the founding fathers did with committees of correspondence
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:08.480]  putting up posters everywhere about red coat tyranny you don't want to be like the founding
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:14.480]  fathers okay or the french resistance seriously that don't put them on private property folks
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.200]  because i don't want to violate that and then let the media make a big deal out of it so put them
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.400]  in legal and lawful areas and pass them off to friends george uh thank you for calling in george
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:31.920]  from connecticut you're on the air hi alex i have uh two suggestions uh i i i appreciate your rent
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:38.640]  on uh fluoride and uh and inoculations i'm wondering if we could find a date uh somewhere
[02:27:38.640 --> 02:27:44.240]  that would be appropriate whether the health uh weak or something like that and and sort of get
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:49.280]  all of the people that are also against that liberal and conservatives i mean uh the health
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.880]  ranger uh did something with gary knoll on the seeds but gary knoll is one of the one of those
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:59.920]  guys on the east coast in new york with pr and one of the largest uh liberal stations and online
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:04.800]  things but that's always trying to uh go to legislators and well no that's the issue i want
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:10.400]  to be clear you've got real liberals like thomas jefferson was a real liberal who really are for
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:16.160]  freedom and good food and health and community and who want a safety net and who want to help people
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:21.200]  the problem is the system always ends up using that towards bad just like mainline right wingers
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:26.160]  wants security but then that gets turned into a police state and so i when i talk about liberals
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:33.440]  i mean the authoritarian know-it-alls that liberals are obama supporters sign petitioned
[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:38.320]  to ban and and repeal bill of rights i mean that there's current video they would call themselves
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:46.400]  liberals these are whacked out screwballs basically and they are multiplying everywhere
[02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:53.680]  and so i agree we should have a march against poison in our environment and focus it in on all the
[02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:59.280]  additives and the chemicals and the real we should have a march for real environmental awareness
[02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:06.480]  where real environmentalists march not about some pie in the sky uh scam for carbon taxes to make
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:12.800]  al gore money but march for real environmental issues yeah what i'm trying to get out is if we
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:19.280]  could get all of the big cashes or against us also uh savages against this if we're all
[02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:24.480]  sitting on uh we could focus on some sort of date and get everybody to focus on then the
[02:29:24.480 --> 02:29:28.960]  national media could not ignore it it would i want to hear your idea stay there i'm gonna come back
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.040]  to you george i want to let you flesh that out that's very important we should do it i mean
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:39.360]  kokesh mainly through this show promoted his uh 50 state march the mainstream media demonized it
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:45.040]  helped magnify it and look at half and it just shows how the alternative media has major platforms
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:51.840]  now so i think that's a great idea savages against gmo because he's smart we're on the march the
[02:29:51.840 --> 02:30:03.680]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network calben soap company can save you thousands

[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:49.360]  americans now on food welfare that is just some of what is coming up i haven't really hit yet
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.120]  but going back to george george i mean what would you call the rally when would you set the date
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:34:03.920]  what would you do go ahead george we we we held you over i see you're still there on hold so you
[02:34:03.920 --> 02:34:11.600]  could complete what you had to say that happens sometimes with our callers i don't i don't know
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:15.200]  i say hey we're going to hold you over and they almost never stay on so we can hear what they
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:21.440]  have to say i mean i guess you're asking me george what we should do and i don't really
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:28.160]  like to think of myself as the overt out front leader uh i could easily have big events all over
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:36.000]  the country i could easily uh you know have a second american revolution tour and and then
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:41.680]  inculcate you know what revolution really means a peaceful revolution and have other speakers attend
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:46.160]  it uh and i've actually thought about doing that in fact as soon as i finish obama deception too
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:54.720]  i might do like a tour maybe six seven eight nine ten i don't know cities it's just so much goes
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:35:04.640]  into that uh that i have to like think is it better just to sit here into the radio show and make
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:10.000]  films that reach millions instead of going around and sure having thousands of people come out make
[02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:15.280]  money to be able to fund the operation you know if we charge to get in you pretty much have to
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:21.280]  everywhere pay for the venue uh and then have the media notice you've got 10 000 people out
[02:35:21.280 --> 02:35:26.960]  so that people go oh he has a lot of listeners i mean it really is only good for propaganda purposes
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:34.480]  to make info wars look big and to make info wars look powerful that's like i've had all these new
[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:39.280]  york publishing companies the biggest offer me ghost written deals they put a book out every six
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:46.080]  months and i just haven't done it because uh i'd have to promote the book do it and then it wouldn't
[02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:53.440]  even reach that many people but it's prestigious to be at barns and noble and i just i just haven't
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:36:02.640]  done it but the argument is if i don't put myself out there as the leader other people will do it
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:09.040]  people that have criticized ron paul and criticized oath keepers and criticize libertarians and
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:15.920]  criticize constitutionalists now even wear military style shirts on air and say that they are the
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:23.360]  leader and as long as they don't backstab us okay i you want to be the leader if people
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:29.520]  think of the leader go be the leader the problem is i still see that the person is making themselves
[02:36:29.520 --> 02:36:37.040]  the leader so they can drag a large double-edged knife across our throat more properly um but i
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:42.560]  mean i i you know i see where glenn beck is giving speeches now and it's like with steward roads and
[02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:49.360]  with uh other you know pretty hardcore patriot people uh and so i'm like well that's that's a
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:54.880]  good sign but again beck knows which way the wind's blowing i mean to get off and glenn beck
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:37:01.680]  but just as a weather vane he knows that the libertarian constitutional movement is the
[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:07.040]  fastest growing thing that now it doesn't work to say ron paul supporters should be arrested
[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:11.200]  the army should be watching them that's a quote from five years ago just look it up
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:18.560]  and he made many similar comments then now he only goes after me because he sees me as a rival
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:22.240]  to be knocked off so he'll take things and take them out of context or make stuff up
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:26.400]  and i really just want glenn beck to come all the way i want to be able to trust him
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:30.560]  because i'm not in competition with him my goal is to reach more people period
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:42.720]  and i hope that's his goal my gut tells me that he's super bad news uh and uh super sneaky but
[02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:48.080]  people have been actually critical some of them that i've not been negative about glenn beck
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:52.960]  and i just kind of went off into that because that's a model of things that's out there and
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:57.440]  the reason is i don't want at the end of the day if we lose this fight to have looked back and said
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:02.720]  oh i in fought with a bunch of people even if they bait me into it i just don't care
[02:38:04.480 --> 02:38:12.400]  in fact it's a good thing when msnbc and cnn and fox news fox news had a piece last week saying i'm
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:16.960]  lying about two billion bullets and the people on youtube pointed out well here's other fox news
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:22.640]  reports confirming the two billion bullets i mean they're coming after me folks from every angle
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:29.920]  and i see that as a really good thing but i want to believe there's other good people out there
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:34.160]  that want freedom who are in the conservative libertarian movement i know drudge report dot
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:39.200]  com is good i know those are people that care about freedom and aren't just opportunistic um
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:44.800]  michael savage gets better and better we were just talking about michael savage being anti gmo well
[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:51.280]  he's got a university mainline doctorates in nutrition and botany folks from real universities
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.840]  he really is a doctor of what is it botany uh so i mean he knows okay these main gmo crops
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:03.520]  grow their own pesticide and kill bugs that eat it and then that's safe for us to eat
[02:39:03.520 --> 02:39:10.320]  and the lawyers that got it all approved the bt corn the bt this and that are monsanto lawyers
[02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:19.520]  lawyers and archer dangles midland gmo lawyers and wow this is a really bad idea and all the studies
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:29.520]  it's killing the lab animals that's my point is that did you hear me earlier tell you that
[02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:35.440]  all over the world you can look this up they're still giving people from the batches of polio
[02:39:35.440 --> 02:39:40.480]  vaccine made in the fifties and sixties they re-batch that over and over again they grow from that
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:46.960]  stock that's filled with a whole bunch of deadly communicable viruses that give you cancer i mean
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:56.160]  that's an absolute fact and they're giving it to people here in america i don't have time to fight
[02:39:56.160 --> 02:40:01.920]  with rachel madow and glenn beck and newsbusters and all these other people man i do not have time
[02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:08.240]  for this stuff every time i get in an in fight with somebody i get ashamed later when i think
[02:40:08.240 --> 02:40:16.160]  about what i did do people get it do you get how real this is okay do you get that aspartame that's
[02:40:16.160 --> 02:40:24.080]  in 10 000 plus products will give you match your regeneration of your nerve tissues in your eyeballs
[02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:29.760]  it's not a joke going blind do you understand they're killing us i said i'd go to your calls
[02:40:29.760 --> 02:40:35.200]  and there's it's just like what is the point it's almost like bad to even come do a radio show and
[02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:40.480]  joke around and have ads and okay let's go back to the news now oh let's look at the Zimmerman
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:46.240]  thing blah blah blah i mean while i know all over the country they're sterilizing people against
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:52.880]  their wills uh in prison or parents have their kids taken and then they're sterilized and people go
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:58.560]  well there are too many poor people that's not the plan they're setting the precedent to make
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:02.320]  everybody poor and dumb and they just want to be able to get away with sterilizing you when
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:08.560]  they want to have that sadistic power i covered that earlier you know the la tv stations are
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:14.160]  reporting that they're against people's wills people that are in jail for dw i they go and
[02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:22.000]  they chain you down and they cut your tubes of course they do i mean they stick their hands
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:28.720]  in your body in texas when they pull you over now all over the place i pulled you over speed and
[02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:34.800]  get up against the car and not only do they assault you that way they wear the same glove on
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:41.840]  multiple people i mean it is just it is but but she blew bubbles at the demonstration and one
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:48.720]  touched me you charged with felony assault oh you attacked me with the cops even sit around and go
[02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:54.400]  what do we call it in the with the with the with the grand jury you call it detergent
[02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.320]  you say that she threw detergent in your eyes the detergent acid
[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:06.560]  we might even be able to get 10 years on this woman who was blowing bubbles at a park and
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:23.040]  hit me in the eye i mean it's just evil is rising and it came out in texas but other parts of
[02:42:23.040 --> 02:42:29.360]  the country the juvenile thing with the little kids in cps not just you know 10 12 13 where they
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:34.640]  would have the judges and the police in in these big rape parties and little kids and the texas
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:38.960]  rangers tried to stop it and they all just got in trouble and they were removed the head of the dps
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:43.440]  because he was allowing them to investigate it i mean that's who runs texas much child molesters
[02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:49.360]  that's who runs your state and that's who runs your country and that's who is infesting the bbc
[02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:57.040]  and you just got to grow up and realize it these people aren't going to stop till we stop them
[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:01.760]  why do they like to give little kids cancer because they like killing people
[02:43:01.760 --> 02:43:07.920]  they're not trying to reduce population they give you an engineered virus that will kill you
[02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:11.360]  when your hormone levels go down around retirement and then they'll suck every
[02:43:11.360 --> 02:43:15.920]  bit of money you've saved out with the chemotherapy and the and the radiation and the surgeries
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:22.960]  it's all been planned it's all been actuary it's all done on purpose bear had plans to give people
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:29.200]  hiv and hepatitis and then even had a plan to roll out treatments for that in the countries
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:35.680]  where they were given people the hiv and the hepatitis look it up they're not playing games
[02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:41.360]  they're systematic murder teams and of course they've got idiots out there doing proctology
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:45.520]  exams on the side of the highway they're going to do whatever they want
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:53.360]  and then the new york times because bear made the decision to put their riskier factor eight
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:59.920]  overseas they call it riskier see that's how they spin it too it was riskier that we
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:07.120]  took factor eight product that had hiv in every ampule of it and three types of hepatitis and
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:14.400]  then dumped it on the third world and on europe and on australia giving conservatively hundreds of
[02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:23.600]  thousands of people death sentences and it's just it's just a oh it was a we get yeah it's just an
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:29.680]  oversight folks do you know about bear pharmaceuticals do you know about illy lily you know about any
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:34.480]  of these companies do you know who these people are you might want to find out who they are and
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:41.040]  if you're a cop who's been told we're now gonna do cavity searches on the side of the highway we don't
[02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:48.880]  need no war it's no more you better ask yourself why you've been given all this illegal power all
[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:53.840]  right i'm gonna shut up who was i talking to bill in california here on the air go ahead
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:45:00.800]  can you hear me there yes sir i can hear you great what do you want first the good the bad or the
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:09.520]  doable i want it all okay the good is that we're seeing ammunition show up at the big old sailors
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:19.200]  uh we're getting uh some uh seven six two by thirty nine fairly affordable we're getting some
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:26.720]  two twenty threes the price is still too high twenty twos are hard to come by all they have
[02:45:26.720 --> 02:45:33.760]  is illy and i think that's a british firm but anyway that's the good you know what they got
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:40.240]  to import most the bullets now especially lead based they want to allow lead mines to operate in the
[02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:49.600]  u.s we're under industrial sabotage go ahead yeah the bad is that we're coming coming close to a
[02:45:49.600 --> 02:45:57.680]  showdown and we really don't want to have our people slaughtered there's a couple of good books
[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:05.040]  and some people you might want to get on uh the guy who calls himself max velocity has a
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:14.080]  little trainer on uh small unit tactics called contact and uh it's one that i read carefully
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:20.320]  before adam's march but mostly small unit contest stuff i see is like out in the wilderness
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:26.560]  battling people i mean i mean the real contact if everyone to a civil war is you walk in a globalist
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:31.920]  bar and take everybody out and i'm not saying people should do that but i mean a lot of these
[02:46:31.920 --> 02:46:36.960]  video games are teaching people and i'm not the max velocity on the show before with one of our
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:41.360]  other get a host but i'm not saying his stuff's bad i haven't really followed it but so much of
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:46.560]  what i see is like we're going to be out in the woods battling the new world order you don't wait
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:52.000]  to go find some army in the woods folks if this thing goes to hell in a hand basket you go out
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:58.400]  and you find them i'm sorry go ahead the main thing that we're thinking of is uh defending
[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:03.040]  ourselves and you don't want to know i hear you but if they start coming after people
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:08.240]  you know how to defend yourself the best defense is a vicious unending offense
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:17.920]  well okay we have another good book out there by a guy who calls himself joe nobody which is
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:27.440]  the homeschooled shootest which covers the basics of shooting uh internal external ballistics the
[02:47:27.440 --> 02:47:34.720]  kind of things that everybody needs to know and if you read these things and then consider yourself
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:44.320]  and your ability uh you'll say i'm too old too fat too slow i can't do this in that case
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:51.520]  pass the book on to a younger poet that's uh so that's the bad and now the doable
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:48:00.640]  in california here we have a recall procedures and many states have a formal recall procedures
[02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:11.200]  and we need to have a watch on the state capital and anybody who steps over the line and of course
[02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:19.360]  in california that's almost everybody we go after them on a recall these politicians have
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:31.360]  got their whole career planned around the um oh come on term limits and as such they've got their
[02:48:31.360 --> 02:48:39.040]  war chest all up but if you deplete their war chest on a recall you can knock them out of politics
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:46.720]  we did that to rubberty who pushed through a anti-gun bill uh we were able uh just using the
[02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:54.160]  internet to collect enough signatures to force him to a recall election no i hear you a lot of
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:58.640]  times if you just start a recall and get your first few thousand signatures and get people to
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:04.480]  support you it'll become a news issue and just that heat will make the politician turn tail and run
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:08.000]  now now what's the good news i gotta go to other people brother all right the good news is we do
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:15.120]  this without the the media we have to do this on the internet we need to get a a bunch of people
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:23.600]  in each state ready to go and so that they can distribute petitions right locally without touching
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:28.880]  the internet without touching the media absolutely we are we are the media god bless you sir a lot
[02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:38.160]  of great points you made theo in wisconsin you're on the air welcome oh i'm afraid that the patriot
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:46.800]  man militia will be quite operational by the time your new world order robot armies arrive
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:55.120]  oh i love that twist on palpatine good job i'm afraid we're aware of your new world order plan

[02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:15.520]  because there's a war on for your mind well the corporate dyno media and the justice department
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:22.560]  have been caught trying to hype up race rioting if towards everyone is found out guilty and
[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:27.520]  now that the defense is putting on its case i don't know when is this thing supposed to be over
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:33.520]  i mean it's just an excuse for people to go around and riot i mean our black folks can
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:42.400]  riot because so many black people are killing each other or or vice versa if if if uh white
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:50.000]  people supposed to riot of a black person uh you know attacks a white person even in self-defense
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:55.360]  it's just the media trying to create division that's all that's going on here
[02:54:55.360 --> 02:55:02.880]  and we have an article threats to riot and loot if zerman found innocent intensify well yeah they
[02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:10.240]  build a fever pitch and if i made a comment like this i would be arrested if i called for rioting
[02:55:10.240 --> 02:55:14.000]  and looting and and and pre-planned criminal activity that's not protected by the first
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:20.880]  amendment um you can't say you know hypothetically let's all meet up and burn down the capital if
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:26.640]  they don't find um you know this guy guilty or let's go out and attack some white people
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:33.200]  but but that shows the political correctness how the idea is sold
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:40.480]  that inherently you know this is the new civil rights movement is that all white people are bad
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:44.400]  how about all of our civil rights to not be run by foreign offshore banks
[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:50.160]  how about people in any community protesting against the fluoride near water i talk about that
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:55.200]  so much because it makes me mad that austin has had scientists and doctors all come here
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:04.800]  and medical doctors and top professor toxicologist and here's this harvard study here's this ut study
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.520]  20 points in iq reduction the feds even say take it out of the water now because they had
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:15.200]  such a rebellion last year with their own scientist 90 plus percent of them signing letters
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:19.840]  and saying this is deadly poison take it out because you know the government even admitted it
[02:56:19.840 --> 02:56:25.600]  did you know that they've said for seven years in the journal of pediatrics and the um american
[02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:32.320]  medical association american dental association that children under six shouldn't brush with fluoride
[02:56:32.320 --> 02:56:37.600]  because it creates the dental fluorosis and other problems and bone cancer but then you go hey
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:44.800]  it's like extra fluoride for kids you know it makes me mad and they know that if we ever get
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:50.880]  them on that we get them on everything but oh no we're just supposed to get mad about
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:55.520]  george zemmerman i mean quite frankly if george zemmerman would have shot him wrongly but there's
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:57:01.280]  reasonable doubt it's not the end of the world people shoot each other wrongly all the time why
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:06.240]  is this such a big deal because they're invoking racial division i'll do a little bit of overdrive
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:12.640]  and go back and finish up with theo who wanted to finish up his point that he was um making in the
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:19.200]  last segment uh and then we're going to go to robert and a few others but just briefly here at the

[03:01:35.680 --> 03:01:41.200]  studies and the government even saying reduce it from one part part one one point six parts per
[03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:46.240]  million always start stuttering when i try to hurry at the end of the show uh and and cut it down to
[03:01:46.240 --> 03:01:52.080]  zero point seven uh one parts per million and it's just time to get aggressive with these scum it's
[03:01:52.080 --> 03:01:59.360]  all they recognize god bless you uh let's talk to uh greg listing on kyah uh in utah you're on the
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:07.760]  year go ahead yeah hi i uh i you know you can't i i wanted to make the point you can't just move
[03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:11.440]  to a small town and put your head in the sand because i went out to the health department
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:16.640]  and and spoke with the nurse and i had all the documentation about you know using
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:23.760]  aborted fetus cells and vaccines and uh studies on uh showing that the uh the the mercury causes
[03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:29.360]  autism and all and on and on and they are so asleep i mean just this nurse just that they're
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:33.280]  and defended it like it was still a good thing oh no they'll lie to you most of them say there is no
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:37.520]  mercury in a shot you show them on the answer if they go you're an extremist i mean it's it's
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:43.360]  they just do whatever they're told you know in this town they uh few years ago they didn't
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:47.600]  treat the water with anything it was just right out of the well well as soon as they did let me
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:51.760]  tell you something those hospitals i mean the doctor's offices for the next few weeks just
[03:02:51.760 --> 03:02:56.240]  filled up with people who are sick well yeah you have that first allergic reaction they're like
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:01.360]  the cosmetics make us sick but it's no big deal the gmo makes me sick but i'm going to keep eating it
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:09.600]  they take all over this country aquifer water like austin texas and they dump when they call it fluoride
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:17.200]  it could be over 300 plus chemicals that's a cover for every toxic waste we pay to then drink it it's
[03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:23.680]  a total globalist joke i think there's an alternative i mean i'll tear your motive to
[03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:28.640]  fracking too because when they're pumping over 500 chemicals down into the into the ground like that
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:33.520]  and it's coming up in people's wells there's you know what they're doing they don't need that many
[03:03:33.520 --> 03:03:39.200]  chemicals to break the the rocks down there and lubricate them it's just ridiculous but i i hope
[03:03:39.200 --> 03:03:44.240]  we're helping you out on our bandwidth because we actually have our station uh on the internet too
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:50.000]  hopefully takes a little bit of you know if other stations too i would suggest if they do that you
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:56.080]  know get on the internet uh maybe it'll sure sure 540 am out there in your area and all over the
[03:03:56.080 --> 03:04:03.680]  country our affiliates upstream us and i was talking to uh our chicago affiliate and he said that
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:08.400]  when they first put me on they had almost nobody listening to their streams he said just my show
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:15.440]  a month has 30 000 logins and logoffs and that's not big for my big broadcast you know which has
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:20.160]  hundreds of thousands a day listening to streams uh 600 000 downloading the podcast every day
[03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:25.360]  just that way but for a station they're like wow we had almost no one listening on the internet
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:35.680]  now it's 30 000 a month that log in uh and listen to you just over the stream here in chicago
[03:04:35.680 --> 03:04:42.240]  so that's a big deal all right folks i'm gonna do one more segment in overdrive uh for robert in

[03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:32.720]  borders and given the illegals free tuition more more free welfare that'll bankrupt the country no
[03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:38.720]  no no nation does that that's in deep trouble no matter how much they say turn your guns in

[03:09:41.840 --> 03:09:47.680]  as god special people they think they have the rights to do anything that they want and they're
[03:09:47.680 --> 03:09:54.480]  actually talk this at their post training academy before they even get out on the field that is so
[03:09:54.480 --> 03:09:59.440]  disgusting i know that the more and more they're giving police arrogance training now some departments
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:04.320]  are going the opposite direction towards trying to be public servants and understanding that's
[03:10:04.320 --> 03:10:09.280]  how they get the respect of the people but yeah a lot of state police units because they're really
[03:10:09.280 --> 03:10:14.800]  federal state police units set up in the 30s they don't even know that are like the paramilitary

[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:42.720]  because first wait a minute you might be a terrorist without a warrant we need to do a
[03:14:42.720 --> 03:14:49.280]  proctology exam ma'am you don't have a problem with that do you honey i don't bend over so
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:58.720]  hell no you will you will respect an officer i'm sorry go ahead i i just wanted to uh know
[03:14:58.720 --> 03:15:04.880]  really quick that i contacted bill o'reilly to uh notify him that he should have jesse ventura on
[03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:13.280]  him um that was a segment you had at a later show but uh my question is for people who are
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:20.960]  unemployed or trying to fight the new world order if they're pigeonholed into a position
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:29.280]  that that's all they can get what are they supposed to do for a means of finances what working for
[03:15:29.280 --> 03:15:35.840]  the new world order right they call that killing yourself to live i would do whatever you can
[03:15:37.120 --> 03:15:43.120]  to just try to even though you slowly inform people and slowly try to be somebody on the
[03:15:43.120 --> 03:15:48.880]  inside for good it will do big things like if i was in the texas state police and they pulled
[03:15:48.880 --> 03:15:54.880]  women over for speeding or burnout tail light and one guy goes get the gloves we're gonna do we're
[03:15:54.880 --> 03:15:59.680]  gonna search them you know you want to say well wait a minute doesn't she have a fourth amendment
[03:15:59.680 --> 03:16:04.960]  i'm gonna trick her into comply and and and then the next thing is when they say no they
[03:16:04.960 --> 03:16:09.920]  they then just taser you so it's like now they're having checkpoints under federal funding where
[03:16:09.920 --> 03:16:15.840]  they take blood it's like pull over i'm gonna take blood and they don't even tell you it's voluntary
[03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:21.280]  and then it's like what's wrong with that what are you what are you hiding in your blood what's wrong
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:26.560]  with me sticking a needle in your arm so i mean diana i can't tell you what you should do but
[03:16:26.560 --> 03:16:35.680]  what did uh how did how did uh bill o'reilly uh the uh the um star of fox news uh how did he
[03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:41.040]  respond when you emailed his people and said you they wanted him to have ventura on i actually
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:49.600]  didn't email them i left them a voicemail so um well how dare you how dare you anything else ma'am
