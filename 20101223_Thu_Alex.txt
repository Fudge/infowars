[00:00.000 --> 00:11.980]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:11.980 --> 00:30.420]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.420 --> 00:37.460]  welcome my friends welcome it is the 17th day of December 2010 on this live
[00:37.460 --> 00:43.580]  Friday broadcast we have former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura joining us
[00:43.580 --> 00:50.860]  for a full hour coming up in the second hour today we then of course have our
[00:50.860 --> 00:56.300]  once a week visit with Bob Chapman and we may go into overdrive our in the
[00:56.300 --> 01:01.500]  fourth hour today with a special guest if not we'll do it next week or the week
[01:01.500 --> 01:05.700]  after that but a very special guest with very important information going into a
[01:05.700 --> 01:10.140]  fourth hour of overdrive today we should be able to tell you what's
[01:10.140 --> 01:14.740]  happening with that within the next hour and a half and who the guest is okay
[01:14.740 --> 01:20.740]  let me just briefly right now mention something before I forget to cover it
[01:20.740 --> 01:26.940]  because I saw this three days ago I read it it really didn't surprise me because
[01:26.940 --> 01:30.460]  people I know that have worked in intelligence at the State Department had
[01:30.460 --> 01:39.460]  told me about this over a decade ago and I had also read in different me mainline
[01:39.460 --> 01:46.340]  media reports things that foreshadowed it but Christopher Hitchens with the
[01:46.340 --> 01:53.180]  latest Nixon tapes that they're doling out it has a Henry Kissinger saying
[01:53.180 --> 01:56.780]  that it'd be fine for the Soviets to make basically kill all the Jews that they
[01:56.780 --> 02:02.780]  didn't care and that's freaked out some of the Israeli newspapers and papers
[02:02.780 --> 02:07.020]  like the Jewish Journal headline Kissinger gassing Jews would not be a
[02:07.020 --> 02:14.300]  U.S. problem and he said this in the 1970s Kissinger wrote in a book and has
[02:14.300 --> 02:18.060]  also been quoted many times with statements about how troops are dumb
[02:18.060 --> 02:24.940]  animals to be used their cannon fodder this is how the establishment sees you
[02:24.940 --> 02:32.340]  but there's major movements in geopolitical Balkanization systems to
[02:32.340 --> 02:39.860]  push that the source of all evil is Jews or Catholics or masons or Christians
[02:39.860 --> 02:45.260]  or Muslims when the truth is human societies organize themselves in very
[02:45.260 --> 02:50.500]  similar hierarchical ways and there are quite frankly just incredibly corrupt
[02:50.500 --> 02:57.900]  evil people running all of these major powers I mean that's just a fact and it's
[02:57.900 --> 03:04.420]  the ruling classes that sit above all of these racial or religious groups that
[03:04.420 --> 03:08.620]  are openly teaming up to bring in world government and they see the rest of us
[03:08.620 --> 03:13.540]  as dumb cattle that have to be gotten rid of so at the bottom of the hour I'm
[03:13.540 --> 03:17.140]  gonna get into this and and talk more about the true nature of the New World
[03:17.140 --> 03:21.140]  Order I mean when I tell you something when I come here with my views it's what
[03:21.140 --> 03:30.020]  I really think we don't mince words if I thought that Jews ran to the entire New
[03:30.020 --> 03:34.380]  World Order system I would come on here and say it if I thought Catholics ran
[03:34.380 --> 03:37.340]  the whole New World Order system I would come on here and say it if I thought
[03:37.340 --> 03:44.220]  Protestants did if I thought Hindus or Muslims it's it's it's a priest class
[03:44.220 --> 03:51.580]  that uses management systems and their understanding of human psychology just
[03:51.580 --> 03:59.100]  like an ornithologist studies birds or they have other schools that study marine
[03:59.100 --> 04:05.900]  mammals or groups that study insects they have people that study the stars
[04:05.900 --> 04:14.620]  astronomy mathematics the globalist study human systems and forms of deception
[04:14.620 --> 04:21.740]  and compartmentalization and when you look at the incredible corruption that
[04:21.740 --> 04:25.820]  comes out of Israel in the APAC lobby and they're open-pushed or a strict free
[04:25.820 --> 04:29.940]  speech it's horrible and I criticize it but there's something above that in
[04:29.940 --> 04:34.780]  fact there's several levels above it and so at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna
[04:34.780 --> 04:40.980]  get into that the type of mindset we see through a Henry Kissinger or as a big
[04:40.980 --> 04:46.420]  new Brazinski where they love to just talk about cold bloodedly signing off
[04:46.420 --> 04:51.220]  on people being wiped out and standing down because for them it's a badge of
[04:51.220 --> 04:57.060]  honor that they have disdain against humanity and a blood thirst we'll be
[04:57.060 --> 05:02.940]  right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[05:02.940 --> 05:07.420]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.420 --> 05:11.540]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.540 --> 05:15.580]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.580 --> 05:19.460]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.460 --> 05:23.700]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:23.700 --> 05:27.900]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:27.900 --> 05:32.220]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.220 --> 05:35.940]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[05:35.940 --> 05:40.140]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.140 --> 05:43.500]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[05:43.500 --> 05:49.700]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[05:49.700 --> 05:54.180]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the son so go
[05:54.180 --> 06:02.220]  to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have
[06:02.220 --> 06:06.900]  fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[06:06.900 --> 06:11.420]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug
[06:11.420 --> 06:15.700]  from underneath the Americans at home turning members influence on our
[06:15.700 --> 06:19.940]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[06:19.940 --> 06:25.140]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall the
[06:25.140 --> 06:29.740]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[06:29.740 --> 06:34.140]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[06:34.140 --> 06:37.860]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[06:37.860 --> 06:41.780]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:41.780 --> 06:47.340]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[06:47.340 --> 06:53.060]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[08:35.100 --> 08:39.980]  most controversial ever it's the Pentagon strike it's a 9-11 truth piece
[08:39.980 --> 08:44.340]  and they found some new information and this is gonna be the first time a lot
[08:44.340 --> 08:47.500]  of this stuff has ever been on national television and been given a fair
[08:47.500 --> 08:52.420]  hearing so it's going to be amazing tonight 10 o'clock Eastern 9 o'clock
[08:52.420 --> 08:58.100]  Central with Jesse Ventura he'll be live with us again coming up in about 50
[08:58.100 --> 09:03.060]  minutes from now he wants to get into WikiLeaks he wants to in fact I had some
[09:03.060 --> 09:08.940]  notes here fact here they are from Monday when I talked to him that we're
[09:08.940 --> 09:14.860]  gonna be going over the truth is a crime we're gonna talk about the past gulf
[09:14.860 --> 09:18.540]  piece from last week and some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that wasn't in
[09:18.540 --> 09:22.580]  the piece with the whole force relocation program that is public
[09:22.580 --> 09:26.940]  knowledge it is declassified we'll get to the Pentagon episode we'll get a
[09:26.940 --> 09:31.060]  little bit of the police state censored episode and how he will not fly but a
[09:31.060 --> 09:34.740]  lot of breaking news with governor Ventura coming up and then we've got Bob
[09:34.740 --> 09:39.900]  Chapman joining us and we were contacted a few weeks ago by some activists and a
[09:39.900 --> 09:46.380]  interesting prominent person who wanted to break some news on the show but we're
[09:46.380 --> 09:50.700]  still trying to line all that out so we'll see if we go into fourth hour of
[09:50.700 --> 09:54.620]  overdrive today to cover that if not it'll be next week of the week after but
[09:54.620 --> 10:02.020]  so a surprise guest floating around there as the wild card today if you just
[10:02.020 --> 10:07.100]  joined us coming up at the bottom of the hour I'm gonna get into the National
[10:07.100 --> 10:12.800]  Post of Canada Christopher Hitchens latest Nixon tape Barry's Kissinger's
[10:12.800 --> 10:17.740]  reputation and it's got all this cold-blooded
[10:17.740 --> 10:28.820]  Jew bashing going on with Nixon and then Kissinger and you know I would be
[10:28.820 --> 10:33.460]  fair to Kissinger if I hadn't already read some of Jim's writings and read
[10:33.460 --> 10:36.820]  other writings by people that know him well and I could say well he was just
[10:36.820 --> 10:39.620]  hanging out with somebody who was reportedly putting anti-Semitic
[10:39.620 --> 10:46.820]  Richard Nixon so he was just playing along with it but when you understand the
[10:46.820 --> 10:52.540]  larger mindset of somebody like Henry Kissinger and what I've seen out of the
[10:52.540 --> 10:58.940]  leadership of Israel it is very very dark very very scary and so I'm gonna
[10:58.940 --> 11:01.980]  talk about some of this information coming up at the bottom of the hour and
[11:01.980 --> 11:06.500]  it's very controversial because the truth is controversial and the usual
[11:06.500 --> 11:14.180]  suspects are going after Christopher Hitchens right now and of course there's
[11:14.180 --> 11:23.420]  a report on this so you've got some of the usual suspects going after Hitchens
[11:23.420 --> 11:27.100]  trying to claim he's anti-Semitic when he's one of the biggest supporters of
[11:27.100 --> 11:32.780]  Israel out there almost to a point of blindness and the last nine years has
[11:32.780 --> 11:39.260]  really gotten on the Islamophobia bandwagon now that's not saying that
[11:39.260 --> 11:43.780]  there aren't radical elements of Islam and it's not saying that as a Christian
[11:43.780 --> 11:48.060]  as an American you know to watch news footage in areas of Dearborn other
[11:48.060 --> 11:53.620]  areas of minarets and daily prayers and people in you know eastern dress I mean
[11:53.620 --> 11:59.860]  it it it I'm just being honest it it is irritating but I know a lot of Muslim
[11:59.860 --> 12:06.780]  people they're good hard-working folks and there is a very diverse spectrum of
[12:06.780 --> 12:11.900]  Muslims out there and I certainly don't like women being caned or beheaded for
[12:11.900 --> 12:17.620]  wearing pants so I don't like the whole hardcore Saudi Arabian variant of it and
[12:17.620 --> 12:24.940]  that's the one that the West is allied with you know our own government give
[12:24.940 --> 12:28.100]  special treatment to Saudi Arabia one of the most corrupt regimes in the world
[12:28.100 --> 12:34.740]  and helps export radical Islam and in Iraq where 60% of college graduates were
[12:34.740 --> 12:40.620]  women that include doctors and lawyers where Western music was playing where I'm
[12:40.620 --> 12:44.500]  not saying it's even a sign of a healthy society but it's a sign of a free one
[12:44.500 --> 12:51.420]  playboy magazine being sold in in in shops you either got that extreme under
[12:51.420 --> 12:58.700]  Saddam or the new extreme a women having to wear hoods over their heads so we're
[12:58.700 --> 13:04.660]  gonna get into all this so again I see threats in radical Zionism to liberty
[13:04.660 --> 13:08.140]  and freedom in the United States in the Israeli lobby doesn't mean I dislike
[13:08.140 --> 13:13.540]  Jews or people who believe that Israel has a right to exist just like I see
[13:13.540 --> 13:17.300]  threats from radical Islam but it doesn't mean that I want to have this
[13:17.300 --> 13:22.380]  clash of civilizations or that I buy in to most of this terror coming from
[13:22.380 --> 13:27.220]  Muslims the fact is most of it staged by Western governments in Israel and even
[13:27.220 --> 13:31.020]  her Ritz and Jerusalem Post have written countless articles admitting that this
[13:31.020 --> 13:36.220]  is an open secret that Israel founded Hamas is a counterbalance what in 1974
[13:36.220 --> 13:44.060]  75 against Hezbollah which is Iranian backed the truth is all these
[13:44.060 --> 13:49.940]  governments whether it's Iran North Korea South Korea China Japan Germany they
[13:49.940 --> 13:54.780]  all pretty much used Russia the same tools of manipulation they've all been
[13:54.780 --> 13:58.580]  caught staging a provocateur in events to have the security state apparatus
[13:58.580 --> 14:02.780]  take over I mean read what our founding fathers said it's common sense but when
[14:02.780 --> 14:07.460]  you depoliticize things when you get the religion out of it and just look at
[14:07.460 --> 14:12.500]  what these countries are doing then you can get almost everybody to agree with
[14:12.500 --> 14:17.060]  you that we need to remove this tyranny and put liberty back in place I mean I
[14:17.060 --> 14:23.060]  don't like the Israeli lobby demonizing and pushing to shut down free speech in
[14:23.060 --> 14:26.940]  the United States which they're clearly doing on record one of the most anti-
[14:26.940 --> 14:30.980]  free speech groups out there and it's wrong and it's authoritarian and its
[14:30.980 --> 14:36.260]  tyranny I also don't like different Muslim groups trying to say don't
[14:36.260 --> 14:42.420]  publish things making fun of the Prophet Muhammad look that's what freedom looks
[14:42.420 --> 14:48.420]  like sorry if you don't like it and I don't like the Israeli lobby through the
[14:48.420 --> 14:52.340]  ADL sudden poverty law center a line about yours truly and so doing a lot of
[14:52.340 --> 14:56.420]  stuff see I'm already getting into this I'm already getting into this but I'm
[14:56.420 --> 15:03.740]  gonna cover it coming up a little bit later in the hour but it's wrong you
[15:03.740 --> 15:07.180]  know if there was a big Russian lobby here in the United States manipulating
[15:07.180 --> 15:12.420]  our government I'd be angry if there was a Italian lobby manipulating our
[15:12.420 --> 15:15.980]  government there was a British lobby which there is it's just more well
[15:15.980 --> 15:19.820]  hidden probably bigger than the Israeli lobby we got the Israeli lobby you got
[15:19.820 --> 15:28.220]  big defense but the Israeli lobby and big defense basically have the same view
[15:28.220 --> 15:32.580]  so it's like one group it's all a combine you've got the British lobby that's
[15:32.580 --> 15:35.700]  part of the same Empire system so it's all merged I mean really you've got a
[15:35.700 --> 15:40.140]  lot of forces there that are teamed up going in the same direction and when
[15:40.140 --> 15:43.900]  you only focus in on one group that doesn't mean that that group isn't
[15:43.900 --> 15:49.220]  guilty of doing things that are tyrannical but when you only focus in on
[15:49.220 --> 15:53.340]  one and make a cult out of hating a group you then become blind to all the
[15:53.340 --> 15:58.100]  other heads of the Hydra and then people who associate themselves with that
[15:58.100 --> 16:01.180]  group who were not involved in the corruption and tyranny they will
[16:01.180 --> 16:06.580]  automatically be driven into the arms of the ideological extremist that are
[16:06.580 --> 16:11.280]  controlling it so I'm gonna be talking about that but I need to shift gears for
[16:11.280 --> 16:16.300]  a moment and get back into all the other news this is probably just the best
[16:16.300 --> 16:24.940]  way to go over it is just to start here well let me just read the stacks
[16:24.940 --> 16:31.220]  North Korea says war with South would go nuclear Russia calls on South Korea to
[16:31.220 --> 16:36.340]  halt military drill Reuters got another report here out of Japan where they're
[16:36.340 --> 16:40.340]  now saying their number one threat is not Russia anymore and the old Cold War
[16:40.340 --> 16:44.460]  strategy it's the threat of China and they believe China trying to take over
[16:44.460 --> 16:48.380]  the Chinese are freaking out and threatening Japan right now and and
[16:48.380 --> 16:51.500]  ladies and gentlemen it's kind of like saying you think some of the Muslim
[16:51.500 --> 16:57.260]  nations on average hate America they don't hate the West one-tenth as much as
[16:57.260 --> 17:01.740]  Sunnis and Shiites hate each other this is more complex same thing you think
[17:01.740 --> 17:05.100]  some Japanese don't like the fact that our country dropped a bombs on them and
[17:05.100 --> 17:10.900]  that they lost a war Japanese love us on average compared to the Chinese and
[17:10.900 --> 17:16.780]  vice versa they literally hate each other and the Koreans hate the Chinese
[17:16.780 --> 17:21.300]  and the North Koreans hate the Chinese but they hate the South even more I
[17:21.300 --> 17:25.260]  mean this is just tribalism it's like Hutus and Tootsies and Rwanda killing
[17:25.260 --> 17:32.620]  each other or it's like Christian blacks being killed by you know Muslim blacks
[17:32.620 --> 17:37.740]  in Sudan or where the Christians have the upper hand in Nigeria slaughtering
[17:37.740 --> 17:42.900]  the Muslims it's just an excuse for people to take over other folks land and
[17:42.900 --> 17:49.700]  make them slaves and the globalists know that so it isn't about a German or a
[17:49.700 --> 17:55.020]  African or a Jew or a somebody from China it's about these systems of

[23:59.060 --> 24:16.580]  by the way Aaron is gonna pop in the last little five-minute segment of this
[24:16.580 --> 24:24.260]  hour he saw Brad Metzler's decoded on the history channel I've been
[24:24.260 --> 24:28.340]  interviewed for an episode of it and I'm not gonna talk about it till it comes
[24:28.340 --> 24:38.380]  out because I agreed to not get into too much of it but I tell you Aaron saw it
[24:38.380 --> 24:44.980]  last night and I just can't believe that they one of the hosts of it when
[24:44.980 --> 24:50.820]  they're investigating it compares people to paranoid schizophrenics who think the
[24:50.820 --> 24:55.020]  Statue of Liberty is Lucifer and by the end they go interview these mainline
[24:55.020 --> 24:59.220]  professors that go it is Lucifer it is the light bearer that's basically what
[24:59.220 --> 25:04.900]  the French said who gave it to us but it's the good Lucifer see when you become
[25:04.900 --> 25:12.460]  a 32nd degree Mason they come out and tell you Lucifer and Jesus are one and
[25:12.460 --> 25:18.340]  that's just a fact and that's what Albert Pike their big supreme commander is
[25:18.340 --> 25:23.780]  his painting hangs in every Masonic lodge in the Western world and I'm not
[25:23.780 --> 25:26.820]  even here bashing Mason's because most of them are porch Mason's and don't know
[25:26.820 --> 25:32.140]  this or they read the Isaiah quote and you've got Christ the morning star
[25:32.140 --> 25:37.620]  Lucifer's called the morning star and he's the light bearer so they say that
[25:37.620 --> 25:41.900]  that's a secret code in the Bible and that this is the big mystery that King
[25:41.900 --> 25:48.020]  David and Solomon knew but but see we're cooks for saying it's Lucifer but at the
[25:48.020 --> 25:52.420]  end of the show oh it is Lucifer but they're still cooks it's a loving Lucifer
[25:52.420 --> 25:56.660]  Aaron saw it he's gonna be popping in I mean you can't make this kind of stuff
[25:56.660 --> 26:03.220]  up they're pretty nice people on the show and Aaron said it was overall fair
[26:03.220 --> 26:06.860]  because you know you've got three hosts on the show so that it runs the spectrum
[26:06.860 --> 26:09.940]  of what their views are so I don't know what they're gonna do in the episode I'm
[26:09.940 --> 26:15.220]  in let me just say it's dynamic and I haven't talked to them in two months I
[26:15.220 --> 26:18.700]  need to since I was out in California and barely made it back I'll just leave
[26:18.700 --> 26:22.580]  it at that I need to call them and find out when my episodes coming out because
[26:22.580 --> 26:26.900]  I want to be able to get them on the show and you know get as much out to you as
[26:26.900 --> 26:33.700]  we can before it comes out I mean I I'm just gonna leave it at this I escaped
[26:33.700 --> 26:38.380]  off into the woods and never saw him again I mean and you'll find out if they
[26:38.380 --> 26:44.620]  air this show what I'm talking about but I mean literally I just boom and then
[26:44.620 --> 26:47.660]  called him and talked to him on the phone days later and then that was it I
[26:47.660 --> 26:54.900]  haven't talked to him since but let's just say I'm the only person that escaped
[26:54.900 --> 27:00.220]  alright I'm not gonna go any further you can't make up how crazy my life is
[27:00.220 --> 27:03.620]  ladies and gentlemen you just can't make this stuff up it's too it it's too
[27:03.620 --> 27:07.180]  insane and then I'm so busy you'd think I'd be checking up on these folks and
[27:07.180 --> 27:10.860]  finding out what's developed since then and I haven't so remind me when I go off
[27:10.860 --> 27:15.740]  the air today I got to get on the telephone to those people but they say
[27:15.740 --> 27:21.860]  that a watch pot never boils well I don't watch the pot you know the tea
[27:21.860 --> 27:27.100]  kettle and so it's going off all the time I just go out engage in the missions
[27:27.100 --> 27:35.260]  engage in the operations and move on to the next and that's the secret to why
[27:35.260 --> 27:39.460]  we've been so successful against the New World Order is because we just move
[27:39.460 --> 27:47.100]  forward we don't get distracted or diverted so their first episode was the
[27:47.100 --> 27:54.940]  Statue of Liberty is Lucifer but not Lucifer as alleged on Brad Metzler's
[27:54.940 --> 28:00.500]  decoded I know we'll get Aaron's take on I haven't seen it yet Aaron watched it
[28:00.500 --> 28:04.140]  last night see I when I tell you we don't really have our TVs turned on I
[28:04.140 --> 28:07.860]  mean it it probably takes us 10 15 minutes to get a television working at
[28:07.860 --> 28:13.980]  my house I do watch short clips on the internet but that's pretty much yet or
[28:13.980 --> 28:18.700]  maybe once a month I go to the theater and I watch a full-bore movie and maybe
[28:18.700 --> 28:22.420]  once a year I go see the nutcracker with the children or go see a symphony or
[28:22.420 --> 28:26.100]  something a couple times a year we'll go see you know acrobats when they come to
[28:26.100 --> 28:32.380]  town or non-animal circus something I'm a big animal rights activist I just the
[28:32.380 --> 28:39.700]  smell of monkey and elephant dung and clowns dressed up like demons and
[28:39.700 --> 28:45.020]  looking at the carnies and looking at the totally depressed elephant swing
[28:45.020 --> 28:49.380]  their heads back and forth you can't pay me to go to a circus my parents put me
[28:49.380 --> 28:53.380]  a few times when I was a child I always I mean I wouldn't cry anything we have a
[28:53.380 --> 28:55.780]  babysitter over that would show me a horror movie and then they'd get in
[28:55.780 --> 28:58.860]  trouble or whatever and I wouldn't be scared by it but I would just cry and
[28:58.860 --> 29:04.380]  demand when I was like three four five years old take me out of this circus and
[29:04.380 --> 29:07.500]  I remember being like ten and going with friends to the circus when their parents
[29:07.500 --> 29:10.940]  took me out I just wanted out of there I don't like the clowns I don't like the
[29:10.940 --> 29:16.860]  the elephants you can see where they've been beating them with crowbars side
[29:16.860 --> 29:20.540]  issue I like taking my kids when it comes to the type of circus where they
[29:20.540 --> 29:23.380]  got the guys in the motorcycles that drive around in the cage and they got
[29:23.380 --> 29:28.020]  the acrobats and all that stuff that's what I like that's really cool okay now
[29:28.020 --> 29:32.460]  I'm totally off the reservation here with things that don't matter I'm gonna
[29:32.460 --> 29:35.780]  finish up with this attack on free speech then I'm gonna get into Christopher
[29:35.780 --> 29:40.100]  Hitchens latest Nixon tape Barry's Kissinger reputation I didn't know he

[38:15.180 --> 38:21.780]  Cowboys 49ers just like WikiLeaks is totally wonderful and our savior and
[38:21.780 --> 38:27.340]  perfect and does no wrong and it's the second coming of Jehovah you know on and
[38:27.340 --> 38:34.860]  on and on you know this type of ridiculous propaganda either you just
[38:34.860 --> 38:39.180]  got a totally worship WikiLeaks or you've got to say execute Assange you know
[38:39.180 --> 38:43.460]  just ban all free speech those are the two camps the mainstream media gives you
[38:43.460 --> 38:48.180]  no we look at the facts cast Sunstein behind the announcement of it involved
[38:48.180 --> 38:53.220]  with it three years ago Washington Post op-ed the Chinese dissidents and I'm
[38:53.220 --> 38:56.420]  not for the Communist Chinese but the fact is that these dissidents are known
[38:56.420 --> 39:01.540]  CIA and CIA operatives on record they're the core of WikiLeaks Assange is the
[39:01.540 --> 39:05.820]  young playboy they put up there as the front man he was busted a decade ago
[39:05.820 --> 39:09.540]  for hacking admits he was brought into some national security jobs at that
[39:09.540 --> 39:13.300]  point you've got all these connections there I don't think Assange is a bad
[39:13.300 --> 39:17.740]  guy they put false charges on him that are that they know are gonna fall apart
[39:17.740 --> 39:21.540]  you know oh molestation rape then it turns out not wearing a condom and
[39:21.540 --> 39:26.180]  consensual sex it's all designed to make him the hero and I don't know if he
[39:26.180 --> 39:32.460]  consciously knows that time will tell but the bottom line I told you a year
[39:32.460 --> 39:37.020]  ago six months ago a month ago last week and all of my expert guests who
[39:37.020 --> 39:41.460]  really got a track record of being accurate agreed and concurred and notice
[39:41.460 --> 39:44.380]  all these foreign governments the Iranians the Pakistanis many others
[39:44.380 --> 39:49.260]  they all say this is staged you know this stuff has been redacted he's cut
[39:49.260 --> 39:53.540]  stuff out it basically oh bin Laden still alive oh they've got nukes oh there
[39:53.540 --> 39:58.020]  were WMDs it just promotes all the old propaganda just because a document
[39:58.020 --> 40:01.220]  secret doesn't mean it's real some of the most brainwashed groups in the world
[40:01.220 --> 40:06.740]  are inside government and but I told you regardless I said it forces you to
[40:06.740 --> 40:12.340]  side with Assange it forces you to you'll say regardless of who he is we've
[40:12.340 --> 40:17.420]  got to get him out of jail we've got to stop this we can't go along with Bill
[40:17.420 --> 40:23.060]  O'Reilly saying execute people like Assange because it's designed to take
[40:23.060 --> 40:26.620]  all of our free speech now they've got three pieces of legislation cybersecurity
[40:26.620 --> 40:32.020]  open government kill switch surveillance grid control over all ISPs packet
[40:32.020 --> 40:35.740]  scanning just just total big brother it's already in place but they want to
[40:35.740 --> 40:39.660]  grow it and again have it come out in the open which they're now doing you
[40:39.660 --> 40:45.660]  notice they're like yeah we we read all your mail yeah we we're scanning what
[40:45.660 --> 40:50.500]  you buy and what you do it's all illegal but we do it for your own good now
[40:50.500 --> 40:55.380]  they're introducing at the international and national level life in
[40:55.380 --> 40:59.740]  prison if you bring out a leak so they would say well Alex Jones got that
[40:59.740 --> 41:04.340]  Mayak Homeland Security report from law enforcement we're going to put those
[41:04.340 --> 41:09.700]  cops a federal marshal and a state police officer we're gonna put them in
[41:09.700 --> 41:13.500]  prison see it's meant to be a shelling effect even and of course politically
[41:13.500 --> 41:16.820]  they couldn't get away with that so they picked somebody who's a foreigner who's
[41:16.820 --> 41:23.500]  a playboy who most people look at and go man that guy's kind of creepy it's all
[41:23.500 --> 41:29.660]  typecast just for us and here it is the UN announces global policing internet

[42:05.540 --> 42:11.820]  talking more about that but as Ron Paul said you know is the truth treason
[42:11.820 --> 42:16.260]  and again Paul smart he just addresses it as well these are the supposed
[42:16.260 --> 42:20.340]  documents is it treason to release the truth but it's not even the truth it's
[42:20.340 --> 42:24.540]  lies when then lies within lies but Paul knows you've got to come out and defeat

[44:55.740 --> 45:00.580]  completely safe a it's impossible be that's called total tyranny and that's
[45:00.580 --> 45:03.860]  always statistically the greatest danger you should be afraid of big
[45:03.860 --> 45:09.540]  government not phantom boogeymen wearing turbans okay I'm going to get more into
[45:09.540 --> 45:14.020]  this with Bob Chapman because I know he is a deep thinker and shares a lot of my
[45:14.020 --> 45:17.740]  views coming up the third hour today but I want to bounce it off of him and get
[45:17.740 --> 45:20.580]  his take on it because it's so sophisticated we only got five minutes
[45:20.580 --> 45:25.220]  left in this segment I'm gonna I promise I will cover it more coming up in the
[45:25.220 --> 45:29.460]  third hour but if you guys give me a document cam shot or put it on screen
[45:29.460 --> 45:32.340]  I'll show people who are not just listening on the radio but watching this
[45:32.340 --> 45:37.620]  live right now at prisonplanet.tv this is out of the national post big paper up
[45:37.620 --> 45:45.820]  in Canada and it goes on Christopher Hitchens latest Nixon tape berries
[45:45.820 --> 45:52.740]  Kissinger's reputation the immigration of Jews from the Soviet Union is not an
[45:52.740 --> 45:56.660]  obligation of the American foreign policy and if they put Jews in the gas
[45:56.660 --> 46:01.020]  chambers in the Soviet Union it is not of America's concerned Henry Kissinger
[46:01.020 --> 46:08.820]  and he goes through all of this information now again I'm gonna cover
[46:08.820 --> 46:15.100]  this more coming up but here is the Jewish Journal headline gassing Jews
[46:15.100 --> 46:20.620]  would not be a US problem Kissinger the tapes Chronicle President Nixon's
[46:20.620 --> 46:27.860]  obsessions with disparaging Jews and other minorities continuing with that
[46:27.860 --> 46:31.980]  information there's a good article by Henry Macau Henry Kissinger was a
[46:31.980 --> 46:37.820]  Soviet agent and that's now been coming out in these documents I mean I remember
[46:37.820 --> 46:43.380]  Bob Chapman telling me that 10 years ago here's Jewish ideas daily Christopher
[46:43.380 --> 46:48.140]  Hitchens Jewish problem they attack him for attacking Kissinger and this is what
[46:48.140 --> 46:51.180]  I've noticed if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger and tell Rolling Stone
[46:51.180 --> 46:56.380]  magazine in 1977 you admire Hitler and want to be a dictator and that he had he
[46:56.380 --> 47:00.460]  would hand out Adolf Hitler recordings on records and reportedly dressed up as
[47:00.460 --> 47:04.780]  in a Nazi uniform and call black subhuman and intimidate them inside the
[47:04.780 --> 47:14.820]  gym you get ADL awards if you are not anti-Semitic but anti-globalist you
[47:14.820 --> 47:20.300]  will be called an anti-Semite and it's simple the ADL is a bucket of black
[47:20.300 --> 47:28.020]  paint to basically take post-World War two anti-German rhetoric and put it on
[47:28.020 --> 47:31.660]  the American people you just you just take the Nazis and you say oh you want
[47:31.660 --> 47:34.740]  freedom you you don't want open borders you don't want government run health
[47:34.740 --> 47:39.220]  care you're a racist you're a Nazi meanwhile Hal Turner who I told you
[47:39.220 --> 47:42.340]  almost a decade ago was a Fed now confirmed highest level national
[47:42.340 --> 47:47.660]  security attack yours truly every single week some cases daily it's just
[47:47.660 --> 47:52.780]  come out in in came out just last year in the Florida papers about the big
[47:52.780 --> 47:55.580]  Nazi rallies they were having going through towns all over those were
[47:55.580 --> 48:03.500]  entirely cops there was no Nazis in the group it they it's a way to make any
[48:03.500 --> 48:07.300]  type of political discussion look crazy just like the government got caught
[48:07.300 --> 48:11.540]  creating the Viper militia with a bunch of methhead drug dealers to then say
[48:11.540 --> 48:15.980]  militias or methhead drug dealers it's just like to go out and find these
[48:15.980 --> 48:20.900]  patsy you know young prison converts to Islam who are Hispanic black white
[48:20.900 --> 48:27.020]  they're always super poor super low IQ and the feds lead them as their
[48:27.020 --> 48:30.980]  imams to go blow stuff up they're not infiltrating groups that are already
[48:30.980 --> 48:35.100]  going to do it they're going out and creating them so I want to explain this
[48:35.100 --> 48:41.780]  and and now it's gotten so blatant so brazen so naked so out in the open so
[48:41.780 --> 48:47.180]  unclothed that no one is buying it anymore I mean I mean the ADL's lost its
[48:47.180 --> 48:51.660]  power now they're out of gas because when they come out and say you know
[48:51.660 --> 48:56.660]  Glenn Beck's criticizing George Soros oh he's bad people are like what what is
[48:56.660 --> 49:00.820]  it you know George Soros admits he worked for the Nazis that's not
[49:00.820 --> 49:07.340]  debatable going around robbing you know taking stuff from other Jews and that's
[49:07.340 --> 49:14.540]  this type of attitude that I've seen you see it's very sophisticated and I'm
[49:14.540 --> 49:17.140]  about to go to break but I'm gonna get more into this later in the third hour
[49:17.140 --> 49:21.900]  today but I remember reading a book many years but 12 years ago or so the
[49:21.900 --> 49:25.620]  distant mirror going back to medieval times and how all this got set up and
[49:25.620 --> 49:31.540]  and operates and when the Royals started using Jews to be their treasurers
[49:31.540 --> 49:35.180]  because then they could rob them whenever they wanted to they didn't want
[49:35.180 --> 49:38.180]  the general public to be allowed to engage in banking but if they use an
[49:38.180 --> 49:41.100]  unpopular minority it would give them great power but then they could also
[49:41.100 --> 49:44.900]  rob them this actually gets into real history I'm somebody who actually has
[49:44.900 --> 49:49.740]  read hundreds of real history books you know they the true history of it but
[49:49.740 --> 49:52.540]  but I'll leave you with this before I really get into the big secret the
[49:52.540 --> 49:57.020]  globalists don't want you to know why do you think this is on Israeli
[49:57.020 --> 49:59.900]  television this is not denied in the US it's almost unknown it's in my film
[49:59.900 --> 50:05.700]  endgame that 110,000 Jewish children were radiated many of them to death it's
[50:05.700 --> 50:08.620]  called the ringworm children they say you're going to get a dental appointment
[50:08.620 --> 50:13.220]  and you're gonna have you're gonna be de you know fungus that's what ringworm is
[50:13.220 --> 50:20.780]  and they would hit him with radiation now now the US government paid from 1951
[50:20.780 --> 50:28.140]  to 1961 to a radiate 110,000 Jewish children by the way they were the dark
[50:28.140 --> 50:37.060]  skinned Sephardic out of North Africa and what the Romano types out of Spain
[50:37.060 --> 50:41.540]  and this is a fact and they took those little kids and they murdered them many
[50:41.540 --> 50:44.780]  of them others they just fried of course our own government did it to foster
[50:44.780 --> 50:51.980]  children in the US but the issue here is where's the ADO on that see this is the
[50:51.980 --> 50:56.060]  big secret this is the big secret you're gonna you're gonna get it they're not

[54:09.540 --> 54:13.820]  very start of the next hour so let's go ahead and call him at 58 after he expects
[54:13.820 --> 54:17.980]  to be up right at the start for a full hour Aaron you traveled with me in
[54:17.980 --> 54:21.300]  month and a half ago to California it's two months ago now we're not supposed to
[54:21.300 --> 54:25.660]  get into what happened because it's coming out on television but you know
[54:25.660 --> 54:30.940]  I'm able to cover some of it you know it's weird when you work with TV you
[54:30.940 --> 54:33.580]  know you have to sign something agreeing that but then I wouldn't sign it I
[54:33.580 --> 54:36.580]  said well I'll be able to talk about some of it I'm not but point is I'm not
[54:36.580 --> 54:39.980]  gonna get into all of it even though I can in the interest of the show but we're
[54:39.980 --> 54:43.740]  lucky we got out of there it will be very exciting if it actually goes on air
[54:43.740 --> 54:48.820]  I'm just gonna leave it at that but you did see Brad Metzler's decoded season
[54:48.820 --> 54:51.460]  one episode three I was wrong when I said it was their first episode it's the
[54:51.460 --> 54:57.020]  first one I've heard about and break it down your view of the show yes the
[54:57.020 --> 55:01.220]  first episode I've seen also and the exciting incredible part is that all
[55:01.220 --> 55:06.100]  these so-called conspiracy researchers who've been yourself and others Mark
[55:06.100 --> 55:11.060]  Dice and Stan Monteith were in this episode are all getting airtime but it
[55:11.060 --> 55:14.940]  just simply doesn't seem as hard-hitting as conspiracy theory has been up till
[55:14.940 --> 55:19.420]  now that was my take after seeing the Statue of Liberty episode they just
[55:19.420 --> 55:23.100]  seemed dumbfounded that there was the symbolism hidden in the Statue of
[55:23.100 --> 55:26.780]  Liberty and other objects they look at like Rockefeller Center in New York
[55:26.780 --> 55:31.100]  City well it's designed for the general public yeah but and they didn't know what
[55:31.100 --> 55:35.060]  Prometheus was explain that yeah they talk in one part about the flame on the
[55:35.060 --> 55:39.140]  torch and then they compare it to the Prometheus at Rockefeller Center but then
[55:39.140 --> 55:42.460]  they act like well this this couldn't be anything I don't know if you've ever
[55:42.460 --> 55:46.820]  seen the Nazi Olympic footage shot by Lenny Reifertstahl but she goes out of
[55:46.820 --> 55:50.860]  her way to show the runner holding the torch up against the Sun that kind of
[55:50.860 --> 55:54.780]  symbolism the way I read Hitler drew the rings that's about man trying to
[55:54.780 --> 55:59.260]  become God that's the whole eugenics you know that's why the Rockefellers have
[55:59.260 --> 56:04.500]  put most their fortune on record into genetic engineering yeah but
[56:04.500 --> 56:08.820]  specifically man in his fire that's all about the quest for godhood in terms of
[56:08.820 --> 56:12.660]  symbolism and then when they bring out the Lucifer connection between the
[56:12.660 --> 56:16.980]  lightbearer the Statue of Liberty their first completely dumbfounded as if
[56:16.980 --> 56:20.740]  there could be no connection to Lucifer then when they talk to the so-called
[56:20.740 --> 56:24.860]  mainline researchers they're suddenly relieved within five minutes on the
[56:24.860 --> 56:28.980]  program of having even heard of this symbol that it's just a happy good symbol
[56:28.980 --> 56:32.580]  because Lucifer the lightbearer according to their research is a good
[56:32.580 --> 56:36.900]  hat so we got a giant statue of a man in drag it's not a woman it's not the
[56:36.900 --> 56:40.500]  Statue of Liberty it's the Statue of Lucifer given to us by the Illuminati
[56:40.500 --> 56:45.900]  French and it goes on here and you know my whole deal is they have three
[56:45.900 --> 56:49.140]  different hosts that they're nice folks but you know they're like oh this is
[56:49.140 --> 56:53.820]  gonna be a fair piece we like you well she says that she compares them to
[56:53.820 --> 56:59.540]  paranoid schizophrenics I mean Monty and and and dice are really good guys and
[56:59.540 --> 57:03.980]  and they're really knowledgeable and but I guess they've got to show all sides
[57:03.980 --> 57:08.580]  but Aaron I appreciate you coming on because you happen to see the show it
[57:08.580 --> 57:11.780]  does look like it has high production quality oh yeah and yeah the show looks
[57:11.780 --> 57:16.700]  good it's it's similar in style to conspiracy theory and I am very glad
[57:16.700 --> 57:20.820]  that this kind of information is going on television and hopefully people would
[57:20.820 --> 57:25.500]  do some research from there absolutely but I mean they can't just come out and
[57:25.500 --> 57:28.340]  say yeah it's Lucifer I guess that's kind of the mystery as you find out as
[57:28.340 --> 57:33.380]  they go here's a Mason clip being asked about Lucifer and he says yeah God is
[57:33.380 --> 57:36.020]  Lucifer here it is
[57:36.580 --> 57:42.780]  what is your problem just that sir okay I'm a Christian sir I'm pure and
[57:42.780 --> 57:47.060]  virtuous and wholesome and innocent how can you say anything to buy it about me
[57:47.060 --> 57:51.380]  sir you need to be born again I am born again now did you just say that you're
[57:51.380 --> 57:56.260]  Lucifer I am Lucifer okay to find Lucifer for me pure virtuous wholesome
[57:56.260 --> 58:01.740]  innocent individual that's out to help people Lucifer is yeah Lucifer say that
[58:01.740 --> 58:07.540]  again Lucifer is a pure holy virtuous virtuous now see the Lucifer that God
[58:07.540 --> 58:11.060]  created that's the same one oh man this is great I'm gonna put this on the
[58:11.060 --> 58:15.620]  internet God bless you brother because that's exactly what the Shriners and
[58:15.620 --> 58:21.180]  Mason's teaches at Lucifer Lucifer is like no and you're confirming hospitals
[58:21.180 --> 58:26.220]  they know what sir Jesus said many will say to me on that day Lord Lord did not
[58:26.220 --> 58:29.580]  we do not do these good deeds in your name and you'll say away from me you
[58:29.580 --> 58:38.140]  workers of iniquity I never knew you Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5 mercy no

[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.540]  you here with us thank you Alex always a pleasure to be here and what's the
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.500]  weather like down in Austin now we got plenty of cold snow up here for you
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:32.220]  yeah you had the football dome collapse oh it's about 50 degrees it was 75 two
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:38.100]  days ago speaking of the football dome I actually called the local media guy
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:44.060]  that feels these questions and I don't know I thought I guess I'm getting too
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:49.500]  much like you Alex because when I saw the dome collapse and I saw that that
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:56.220]  Fox News had a camera running the first thing that popped into my head was why
[01:01:56.220 --> 01:02:02.020]  would it wasn't Fox News excuse me Fox TV that does football why would they
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:07.940]  have a camera running inside the dome at five o'clock in the morning sounds like
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.580]  a staged event yeah think about it well we know they're wanting a new stadium
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:18.460]  exactly why why would they have a camera I can't for the life of me I mean the
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.460]  game wasn't until noon they certainly would have ample time to get their
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:29.060]  feeds I've done football you have plenty of time you know in the first couple
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:33.660]  hours before the game to ensure the feeds are there the cameras of where
[01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.780]  they're supposed to be why would they be running the camera at 5 a.m. in the
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:42.540]  morning which caught the collapse perfect well they wouldn't stage an
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:46.340]  event to get a billion-dollar new stadium they've been demanding the Cowboy
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:52.300]  Stadium they just completed last year cost 1.2 billion I mean they wouldn't
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:57.260]  use this as a pretext to demand a new stadium governor well you know it's
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:00.660]  for sure they're gonna get one now you know it seems like the foregone
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.460]  conclusion that you know that they're gonna have to build a new stadium for
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:09.140]  them now but I don't know it just seemed doesn't it seem strange to you Alex
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:13.380]  didn't we have the highway collapse up there too yeah the bridge collapsed on
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:17.340]  highway also that was pretty suspicious a lot of experts and engineers said you
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:20.540]  know you've got a good point and in fact I remember reading about that that
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:26.180]  luckily they had a camera at 5 a.m. in the morning that sounds pretty
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:32.260]  implausible like one out of a thousand well and the but the point is why why
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.420]  would Fox television be running now they've gotten through the film from
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:43.700]  security cameras that were going but why was Fox television running a camera at
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:50.260]  5 a.m. and I'd like to know this that what did they run the camera all night
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:55.180]  or when was the camera actually turned on yeah I mean if they have nothing to
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:04:01.220]  hide we should get Fox Sports TV on the horn well you said that you actually
[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.220]  called him no no no I didn't I just called the local guy on the news and
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:09.500]  posed that question to him what did he say he said that they thought of that
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.380]  too and couldn't they thought that was pretty peculiar but I don't know if
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:18.740]  anything will happen with it or not but I just thought it was pretty strange that
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:23.780]  Fox television would run a camera at 5 o'clock in the morning are you calling
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:29.420]  for an investigation no why because they won't investigate it well I don't know
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:34.180]  it's not that important to me I just found it peculiar yeah but if taxpayers

[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:13.260]  your mind well if you just joined us one the only governor Jesse Ventura is
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:18.220]  here with us he was telling me off air I said hey too bad Larry Kings of retiring
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:22.660]  and he had an interesting behind the story tie-in to the TSA with that we'll
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.900]  talk about that briefly we're gonna get into the governor's concerns about
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:31.460]  WikiLeaks his view of the incredible final show in the second season set to
[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:36.300]  air tonight dealing with the Pentagon in 9-11 I want to get into talk about the
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.020]  amazing episode that I was so honored to be a part of dealing with the Gulf some
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.180]  of the behind-the-scenes things we're gonna talk about it all here in the
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.900]  next 51 minutes but a governor you dropped a bombshell on us and I've seen
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.220]  people point this out but you've even made some better points during the break
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:56.140]  dealing with the Mall of America dome collapse reportedly from the snow
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:01.780]  recap the point you made because I mean I mean it's really suspicious
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:06.820]  I don't know if it is or isn't Alex there could be a logical explanation but nobody's asked the
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:12.300]  questions they've just focused on the fact that the dome collapsed but the
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.120]  other interesting thing was when I watched and I was just watching the same
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:20.460]  thing everyone else was watching right I'm not you know Fox sports with how we
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:27.500]  long and Terry Bradshaw and you know all the North Jimmy Johnson all them on
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:32.540]  TV and they showed it then the first time I watched it I thought how peculiar
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:37.540]  that they would have a camera running from Fox Sports at five in the morning
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:42.820]  and how peculiar that they never even had to adjust it the camera was like
[01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:49.300]  focused right in on where the collapse took place and no adjustment was even
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:56.860]  needed hardly and the bones are pretty big building that is crazy in fact we're
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:03.940]  showing the footage now and they actually had two different cameras focused
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:09.460]  in right where it happens want a close shot want a wide shot governor that is
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:14.060]  I mean maybe there may be a logical explanation Alex I don't know you know
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:19.060]  but I just find it peculiar that as to why they I just like someone to see why
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:25.460]  they were running why Fox Sports was running cameras at 5 a.m. that's amazing
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:30.660]  at 5 a.m. they're running cameras in high-def and recording it when no one's
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:37.740]  in there at 5 a.m. central time that's 3 a.m. Pacific well and it's how many how
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:44.780]  many hours before the game the kickoff is new so you're talking seven hours
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:52.780]  before the kickoff hmm anyway let's move on enough on that very interesting let's
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:56.820]  talk about Larry King I said too bad Larry King over 25 years really leading
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:01.660]  CNN to prominence that he's retiring and you had a tie-in to that you were
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:06.780]  invited to be on his finale show but you can't go well I don't know if I was to
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:10.380]  be on the show but I was invited to the party and all of that stuff there was a
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:15.140]  big hoopla and I thought that about it but I can't go because it would
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.700]  require me to fly commercial airlines and I refuse to fly commercial airlines
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.380]  anymore because I feel they're violating my fourth amendment right of the
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:30.060]  Constitution and that's reasonable search and seizure I believe that is
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:35.460]  Jesse Ventura I pose no threat and so it's not reasonable for me to be
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:40.580]  submitted to all of the search that I have to face every time I fly simply
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:47.020]  because I have a disability and you know it takes my disability and makes it
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:53.660]  to where it exposes my disability rather than accommodate it and so I just make
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:58.380]  the choice I refuse to fly rather than be searched the way they do which I
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:03.060]  believe is a sexual assault to the level if they did it on the street they
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:08.820]  couldn't search you that way and so it's just a personal stand I've made and
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.580]  unfortunately I was invited to be part of Larry's final night to be part of the
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:18.300]  big party and who fly afterwards and I apologize to him but it would have
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:23.100]  required me to fly out there and subject myself to that and I've made the stand
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.660]  and I won't do it governor what's your view on the announcement that first
[01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:34.380]  800 Walmart's now 900 9,000 there's a Homeland Security press release 9,000
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:39.660]  retail stores including Mall of America are gonna have giant telescreens with
[01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.180]  Janet Napolitano telling you to watch other shoppers telling you to spy on
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:48.660]  your neighbors Homeland Security is coming out with iPhone apps where you
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:58.020]  spy on your neighbor I mean now there I would just encourage everybody to go
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.420]  out to the library or go online or wherever where you have to go to get
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:10.620]  reading material and to start reading history on the Nazis yes I think that
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:15.860]  that would be a good thing for people to do to simply refresh your memory over
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:21.860]  the fact that history always repeats itself and so you can always go back
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.380]  in history and you can learn from history and you can watch certain things as
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:32.220]  they fall into place and what they led to the ultimate result you know that's
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:38.020]  what I find so amazing is how when I was governor ten years ago almost some of
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.820]  the things that I did ten years ago are showing up today and that's what
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:51.020]  history truly is and so I would encourage people to get books and go back
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.900]  and read about what the things that went on in Nazi Germany and then compare
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:01.220]  them to certain things that they're doing here and always remember what
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:08.220]  Albert Einstein said a foolish faith and authority is the enemy of the truth
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.220]  well governor there's been a new twist to that speaking of Nazi Germany they
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.420]  first started with unpopular political groups but then expanded it to everybody
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.060]  else they claim all this is for Muslim extremists but now we learn from the
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:23.940]  Mayak and Homeland Security reports as your show also documented in the
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:28.340]  police state episode that it's for Ron Paul supporters Bob Barr supporters
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:34.420]  gun owners libertarians here's an info wars dot com article but it links to the
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:39.940]  major union websites thousands of unions with millions of members are now
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:45.180]  being ordered by Homeland Security steel workers unions taxi cab you name it
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.700]  they've got to get a government biometric ID card be government drug
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:53.860]  tested and you have to file an application with Homeland Security
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:15:00.820]  before you could have a job in America and if that's true Alex that is
[01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:07.780]  completely absurd and I you know I just throw my arms up and go why are we
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:17.340]  letting them get away with this you know that all you can do is I'll keep
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.900]  showing my show and we'll keep talking and hopefully out there people will start
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:27.780]  listening and say enough is enough well you're absolutely right on that point
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:32.860]  you know I do see a big awakening taking place thanks to I hope so I hope we're
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:40.060]  not asleep at the wheel because these things are dangerous and many of the
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:45.740]  little things you just look at them as small things they become big then you
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:52.100]  know like like like I said this enhanced airport security at the airport my big
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.940]  question is who if they stopped wouldn't it be a big news story if they
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:04.020]  caught someone actually trying to get on a plane well governor here that do you
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:08.820]  well no you don't but governor as you know they continually catch the
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:12.780]  underwear bomber being helped on by the US government source Detroit Free Press
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:18.180]  Associated Press they and we're all a locky Fox News reported the number three
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:24.380]  in Al Qaeda has been in command of all these latest patsies oh by the way even
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.500]  Geraldo Rivera and Judge Andrew Napolitano have both come out and said
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:33.620]  that the official 9-11 story is impossible and that it it's just like the
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.860]  JFK assassination of fraud what do you think about that courage you've always
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.740]  been calling for other people to have courage if the judge and her all go
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.620]  actually did that I wasn't privy to that but I'm not privy to everything
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:51.580]  certainly especially when I'm heading to Mexico but if they said that then good
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:55.500]  for them and hooray for the First Amendment to the Constitution because
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:17:00.620]  you know ultimately that's what we're fighting here you know is is our rights
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:05.740]  and the and the disintegration of our bill of rights and it all falls under
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:12.220]  that and it and it falls dangerously because I've said it so many times when
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:16.100]  government says they're going to protect you well then part of that
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.700]  protection is you losing your freedoms and you have to be willing to give up
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:26.580]  your freedoms for that protection I'm not I would rather face face the
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:32.140]  adversaries and I would rather face the whatever it is we have fear of than to
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:38.340]  lose my freedoms I think losing our freedoms is far more important and to
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:43.660]  me Alex it means that if there is this opposition and there is this group of
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:50.100]  people out there that want America overthrown be it Taliban be it whoever
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:57.060]  they are well if they're destroying our freedoms then they're winning because
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:03.940]  it's true our freedoms we have what we have and have had what we've had and we
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.620]  are a country today that was the greatest country in the world do we want
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.980]  to be known as the country that with the biggest failure in history and that
[01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:20.340]  simply was the failure of freedom freedom is the most important thing here and
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:25.900]  all the other stuff in my opinion falls by the wayside and we can't give up our
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:31.980]  freedoms even if it means that occasionally terrorists can attack us if
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:37.220]  we lose our freedoms that's more important in my opinion than you know
[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:40.900]  any other result that could come from it well sure I mean even if you take their
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.540]  official argument that there's this army of turban boogeymen they're gonna get
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:50.740]  us so we gave up all of our liberty and let government goons take their hands
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:54.220]  down our pants and radiate us and we're gonna have big brother telescreens I
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:59.340]  mean you're in the movie the running man and in that film you know written by
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:06.180]  Stephen King it starts with big telescreens in the city streets saying
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:13.340]  report suspicious people I mean in that 1980s book and film the total dystopic
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:17.740]  society is where they have telescreens saying watch your neighbor and now it's
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:23.540]  here yeah and it's insane you know we did the one episode on my show we simply
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:29.140]  went down to Washington Avenue and First Avenue in Minneapolis a normal
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:34.020]  downtown intersection and we're amazed that there there wasn't one camera on
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:38.900]  the corner Alex there were four it's happening everywhere governor I mean
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:46.580]  it was I expected to see one I got down there and saw four on one corner
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:51.940]  amazing stay there we're gonna break come back get into United Nations moles
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:57.340]  internet regulation options because of wiki leaks and O'Reilly says execute
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:01.460]  Julie and Asan we'll be back with Governor Ventura what one food can help

[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.580]  I know you've really been when I talked to you off air Monday you're really
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.460]  upset about this WikiLeaks situation you said you concurred with Ron Paul and
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:38.260]  his speech where he you know came out and said you know telling the truth is
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:42.420]  not treason but then you went on to make the point we'll go ahead and make the
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:48.380]  point yourself well that's just it Alex I mean it's that simple if we're at the
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:53.860]  point that if the government get well first of all this is the classic kill
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:59.860]  the messenger not the message this is a classic thing that happens they're
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:04.060]  putting all the heat on the messenger when ultimately if these things haven't
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.660]  been written in the first place there would be no messenger to tell them
[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:12.620]  because there'd be nothing to tell but they're blaming the messenger and the
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:17.500]  point is exactly what congressman Paul said if our country is at the point now
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:23.740]  where if the government lies or does something and you expose it by telling
[01:25:23.740 --> 01:25:31.220]  the truth and if the truth makes you a candidate for treason then we're in
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:37.500]  horrible shape when telling the truth becomes a treason offense in other words
[01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:42.540]  they're saying it's okay for government to lie but by God if anyone exposes the
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:48.460]  lies we're gonna get you for treason what kind of message does that send the
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:54.940]  kids well what is it right for government to lie and it isn't all right for you to
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:01.060]  catch them or tell on them or expose them or tell the truth well governor what
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.820]  type of message does it send to the press I've been leaked plenty of documents
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:08.740]  that have even shown up on your TV show like the Mayak and Homeland Security and
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:14.980]  others and I mean are we gonna get executed next I don't know and then
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:20.500]  it becomes laughable when you have elected officials like Mike Huckabee and
[01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:26.180]  and these other people who state that this guy should be brought up and put to
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:32.260]  death for treason well you can't commit treason unless you're a citizen of the
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:40.060]  country that simple Alex he's an Australian how can an
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:44.580]  Australian commit treason to the United States well how can Sarah Palin say
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:51.380]  that he's un-American he's not American exactly but but and I guess well then
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:59.100]  what is he insinuating that an American would lie he's un-American because he's
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:03.300]  releasing these truthful documents you notice they're not denying the
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:10.220]  documents are they no there you know there's no denial it's just that it's
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:17.820]  happening and to me it shows clearly that it boils down to even more basic
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:22.180]  than that Alex it goes back to our entire system of government here in the
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:28.420]  United States it's a system based upon bribery and panhandling and in order to
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:32.900]  succeed in that system you have to be comfortable with those thoughts of
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:40.100]  bribery of being bribed is okay and so you have a system and the people that
[01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:45.140]  thrive and live in this system our politicians they're comfortable with
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:50.700]  that so they're also comfortable with the lying then that obviously goes on
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:55.980]  continuously in our foreign policy and they're saying it's treason to expose
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:01.540]  their criminal activity here's another angle of it I want to get your take on
[01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:07.780]  since when can the United States or the crooks that run it the gangsters as you
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:11.500]  say the Crips in the Bloods or the Gambino's in the Genoveses you know
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:16.620]  pick your flavor of poison since when governor can they reach across the world
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.580]  to England or Australia and they're now openly have a grand jury federally in
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.420]  panel and they're saying they may try to extradite him on espionage or treason
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.220]  or something they've got a bill now saying it's treason even if you're a
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:33.180]  foreigner because it was pointed out a few days after Huckabee and O'Reilly
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:38.740]  called for his execution that he's not an American can the Communist Chinese not
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:43.540]  like what Jesse Ventura says or Ron Paul or Alex Jones or Bob Barr and can
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:48.980]  they then come and and extradite us to China because say some Chinese
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:54.020]  dissidents give us some documents and then we publicize them yeah
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:59.500]  I mean this is absurd it's it's closing the barn door after the horses have
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:07.860]  already gotten out you can't pass laws and go after a guy after he did it how
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:16.260]  do you create a new law and then retroactively apply it that's insane
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:23.620]  and the point is why why are we creating laws that stop the truth it boils
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:29.540]  back to what congressman Paul said when the truth becomes treason our country
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:35.060]  is hurting and people we better wake up and understand that the truth is what
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:42.700]  it is it's not something that you know certain elements create or allow to you
[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:48.220]  know why and then you're not allowed to expose them stay there gotta break gotta
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:55.740]  break powerful we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the
[01:29:55.740 --> 01:30:02.740]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:07.180]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:11.220]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:15.100]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:19.140]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:23.700]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.700]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:31.540]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:35.140]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:39.500]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:44.820]  gamut of things we're discussing but I wanted to finish up with the really
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:48.980]  powerful points that cut right to the heart of living in a free republic the
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:52.580]  governor Ventura was talking about I want you to finish the statement you were
[01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:58.020]  making when the when the break cut you off but first I want to get or then I
[01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:03.020]  want to get your take on the top story on the drudge report and info wars.com
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:07.660]  right now UN moles internet regulation options and they have a direct link in
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:11.460]  IT news to the UN announcement that they want to have everybody with internet
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:16.740]  IDs tracking where you go taxing the internet and they call it a internet
[01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:22.500]  takeover this is the UN quotes and this was in a meeting in New York two days
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:27.540]  ago and the United Nations says because of wiki leaks so there's a few
[01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:32.380]  terrorists we've got to all lose our rights there's somebody doing you know
[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:35.900]  the the wiki leaking that government doesn't like so we've all got to lose
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:39.020]  our rights I mean this is this is tyranny is it not governor
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:56.660]  lately absolutely it is because of a few rotten apples the internet was the
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:35:01.220]  only thing they haven't been able to control and they must get control of
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:06.780]  it so it's not surprising at all that they're gonna drum up that we all that
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:12.020]  we're all in danger and that's for our own safety they should take over the
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.740]  internet and we all have to have ID cards and we can all be tracked and
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:22.460]  anything we do and say can be you know looked over and made sure of if the
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:29.100]  internet allows that to happen I don't know if they can but if you know they
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:35.460]  do it to telephones and all that now so it can't be impossible but if that does
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:41.180]  happen it's going to be a very dark day on the planet what do you think overall
[01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:51.780]  of Julian Assange well to me he hasn't broken a law all he's done is reveal
[01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:57.380]  documents he's not a citizen of the United States so he doesn't have to have
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:03.620]  any allegiance to our government or policies or our political standing and
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:10.380]  again if everything he releases is the truth well then the truth shouldn't be
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:15.980]  considered bad it's that simple the truth should never be a bad thing the
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:22.860]  truth should always be a good day and so I I support fully I stand with Michael
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:29.060]  Moore this guy doesn't belong in jail at all and what he's doing again it's the
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.100]  classic case of killing the messenger which is him rather than the message
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:40.780]  which is the information that he's putting out and if the information
[01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:46.740]  wasn't put out in the first place there would be nothing to spill and this is
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:52.940]  also a power play to let us as citizens know that if you go against the
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:59.780]  government they will attempt to destroy you open your eyes up people and see
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:05.180]  that that this is a clear example they're gonna try to make an example out
[01:37:05.180 --> 01:37:11.700]  of this guy they got to because he's gone over a new line on them and they
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:15.940]  they're now the power brokers are now taking the sword and drawn the line in
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:22.020]  the sand and they're gonna attempt to get this guy and make an example of him
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:27.260]  so that there will be no more down the road and I don't believe in a free
[01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:33.300]  society we should allow that to happen well we all hang together hang separate
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:38.260]  as Benjamin Franklin said and there's also been calls by Lieberman and others
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:42.660]  to look at indicting people at the New York Times people in the British
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:47.180]  government are talking about indicting folks in the Guardian newspaper because
[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:51.380]  they got the leaks I mean that's what Assange is saying I'm a journalist I've
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:55.940]  been given this stuff we've vetted it we've released it it was leaks that
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:38:00.540]  brought down Nixon it was leaks that just that exposed the Tuskegee experiment
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:06.260]  why do you think they're trying to stop it Alex they gotta put the line in the
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:12.420]  sand now this is a major major thing this is one of the biggest things that's
[01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:17.980]  happened in my lifetime in my opinion this WikiLeaks stuff is gonna rate right
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:24.880]  up with 9-11 and it's gonna rate right up with the murder of John Kennedy well
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.580]  they're certainly using it to try to curtail the internet and my free speech
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:33.940]  and exactly and that's huge I mean our basic Bill of Rights is on the line
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:39.820]  here not only the Fourth Amendment for reasonable search and seizure but also
[01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:44.580]  the First Amendment governor to write the free speech Alex is there any doubt
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:48.860]  then that they're running a blitz against every one of our liberties
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:53.300]  doesn't matter if it's Clinton Bush Obama what do you think's going on here
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:58.540]  well it certainly shows to me that Democrats and Republicans are from the
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:05.100]  same ilk that they portray that they're not together but ultimately they are in
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:12.020]  the face of holding up nationalism if you follow me no I totally understand
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:16.780]  governor see there's no difference and people need to understand that as long
[01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:21.580]  as we keep electing these Democrats and Republicans this is what you're going
[01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:27.100]  to get nothing different this is it all right we've only got 20 minutes left
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:31.820]  with you and I want to get into the show the new one premiering tonight 10 p.m.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:36.940]  Eastern I'm real excited about it let's let's talk about the new episode now
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:41.460]  that I want to go back to the incredible episode from last week because if
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:45.220]  people have trouble believing there's a plan to force relocate folks out of the
[01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:50.260]  Gulf Mississippi Louisiana and even parts of eastern Texas southeastern Texas
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:55.260]  we have the London Guardian article rebuild or retreat US debates evacuation
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:40:00.980]  of Gulf coastline of four billion dollars excuse me 40 billion dollars to
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:04.980]  fund that and you put them on the hot seat you want to cover that first or get
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:11.300]  into the Pentagon special tonight let's get into that I mean this is some
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:15.860]  groundbreaking stuff I've been privy to some of the behind the scenes it's not
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:21.500]  it's not overly groundbreaking if you're a connoisseur of the facts if you study it
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:27.580]  you know the things that we find out the things we do are not a great deal if
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:32.140]  you're into it do you and you'll understand exactly where we're at but
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:36.540]  it's groundbreaking to get a JFK deathbed confession on national TV for the
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.580]  first time it's groundbreaking to prove the FEMA camps and I mean let me tell
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:44.180]  you this will be the first time some of these eyewitnesses have ever been on
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:50.900]  television absolutely I mean tonight on the show and it's the old classic the
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.900]  mainstream media doesn't talk to the people who actually live through it
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:01.420]  mainstream media avoids those people mainstream media only talks to government
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:07.900]  spokesman who can spew the government story on what happened on 9-11 my show
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:13.540]  we go out and we talk to survivors people that were actually there and
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:21.380]  tonight you will get the opportunity to hear a sergeant in the army with a
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:27.020]  higher-than-top secret security clearance who survived was in the very
[01:41:27.020 --> 01:41:35.980]  room that the alleged plane hit and to hear her story is far different than the
[01:41:35.980 --> 01:41:42.660]  story that you hear come out of the government the official story much the
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:49.100]  same as talking to William Rodriguez the janitor at the World Trade Center when
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:54.980]  his story so much differed from the actual story that was told by the
[01:41:54.980 --> 01:42:00.420]  government and tonight will be one of those groundbreaking stories that
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:05.660]  hopefully mainstream America will now get to hear from the mouth of the
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:12.980]  survivor of the very room the alleged plane struck in the Pentagon why do you
[01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:17.020]  think Geraldo and we'll get back into the show and and now judge Andrew and
[01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:22.220]  Polatano are coming out and and saying building seven suspicious we know the
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:26.540]  story is it true because because hopefully shows like mine are showing the
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:31.540]  facts and showing the cover up hopefully they're going on the internet and
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:37.420]  they're doing some research of their own see my biggest bitch about 9-11 is the
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:42.660]  fact that the general populace that defends the government's position has
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:48.340]  done nothing to learn of what happened that day the only thing they know is
[01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:54.420]  what was on mainstream media television and what the government has told them
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:43:00.220]  and yet if you go through mainstream media and take out all the little
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:06.180]  different tidbits it still paints a far different story I mean there were tons
[01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:11.620]  of stories immediately when the towers fell of mainstream media reporting that
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:18.260]  people hurt masses of explosions then all of a sudden within 12 hours all those
[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:24.020]  stories magically disappeared let's run through some of the bullet points that
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:29.980]  we can reveal ahead of this new show airing tonight at 10 p.m. Eastern on
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.860]  true TV or you just type in Jesse Ventura conspiracy theory it's the top link
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:38.220]  on the search engines if you want to go to their page and also review some of
[01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:42.220]  these groundbreaking previous shows but I'm gonna run through these bullet points
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:47.300]  and then get your comments on them explosive revelation about 9-11 attack
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:52.020]  on the Pentagon destroyed evidence of lost trillions it had broken in the AP
[01:43:52.020 --> 01:43:59.740]  and in the Oregonian the week before that two trillion was missing from the
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:06.300]  Pentagon well it's even bigger than that Alex today before 9-11 Donald Rumsfeld
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:11.940]  held a press conference talking about they couldn't account for trillions of
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:17.460]  dollars yes Pentagon and then ironically to the exact place the alleged plane
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:23.140]  hits is where all these records were kept yes now we're supposed to look at
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:29.300]  that and go cheese that sure was bad luck wasn't it no what comes to me is what
[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:39.340]  Colonel Elfletcher Prowdy says nothing just happens everything is planned man
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:43.420]  that is ground you know you look at things like that though these are real
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:50.100]  things that press conference took place hold on governor again you're I I don't
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:54.460]  have words to describe how big that is that Rumsfeld had the press conference
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:58.860]  it's the area where the records were building 7 had a bunch of similar records
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:04.660]  with the CIA in it and that was only a press conference the day before it was
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.500]  in the news the week before that so he had to respond it was breaking we've
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:13.300]  never seen anything in mainstream news since then there's only I mean this is
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:17.180]  groundbreaking I can't believe there can't be anything since then because
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:24.100]  there are no now there's no clues now all the evidence is gone it's huge and it
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:31.220]  just goes away mainstream media doesn't bother with it anymore they just don't
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:39.020]  bother with it it's gone oh well now now because I haven't seen the show yet I've
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:41.980]  just talked to people behind the scenes I mean can you tell us what the new
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:48.340]  explosive revelation is about the attack with the missing trillions well that's
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:51.580]  pretty easy you know that's part of it what I just explained the fact that it
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:57.900]  hit right in the spot where the accounting would have been done well the
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.020]  evidence was I'm just surprised this is even going to get on air as we know
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:06.460]  briefly the missing police state episode you want to say anything about that well
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:12.420]  apparently there was enough outcry from the congressman and from our
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:18.020]  government that they went to the higher ups of AOL or whatever and they've now
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:22.460]  removed it from the website and they won't show it anymore and they've
[01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:26.740]  basically censored it that's all I can explain on it but you know it didn't
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:31.020]  surprise me because Alex I never believed these shows would get on the air in
[01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:34.220]  the first place well it turns out what you said a year ago in a way is right
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:39.460]  well it's starting to come true well we must have rattled enough cages oh they
[01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:42.940]  got scared about those threat fusion centers commanding the FEMA camp grid I
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:47.340]  mean you hit them hard I mean I've never seen TV where it's where there's a real
[01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:52.500]  Perry Mason moment you annihilated that congressman he was caught with his
[01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:55.540]  pants down and then you annihilated I don't want to talk about that before you
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:59.140]  leave us but we're gonna finish up with the Pentagon episode tonight you
[01:46:59.140 --> 01:47:02.420]  annihilated the head scientist in her minion from the Army Corps of
[01:47:02.420 --> 01:47:06.580]  Engineers you first they deny there's a plan to secretly force relocate and that
[01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:09.500]  they only want business there then you give them the documents and they go oh
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:15.460]  yeah we know about that plan I mean they look like a deer in the headlights I'm
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:21.340]  serious well you know if you do your homework the thing is it's all out there
[01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:26.900]  but getting back and tying it in if we don't have things like wiggly we won't
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:30.940]  be able to do our homework will we no and that's the whole game plan let's go
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:36.620]  to number two hijacker who flew 757 jetliner in the Pentagon unable to fly
[01:47:36.620 --> 01:47:41.580]  single-engine Cessna trainer you guys went and talked to the folks the flight
[01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:45.340]  schools on record they couldn't even get a Cessna off the ground well it wasn't
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:48.820]  that he couldn't get a Cessna off the ground it was simply they didn't trust him
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:54.460]  with one well there was another case where he and we go into it better than
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:48:01.980]  that if we will take tonight the exact what the 9-11 Commission and the official
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:07.820]  government mister whoever does all this stuff we will take their exact
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:14.460]  dimensions for lack of better term and try to duplicate it on a flight simulator
[01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:21.020]  wait till you see what happens now I've talked to so many airline pilots and
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:25.260]  fighter pilots they say what happened at the Pentagon is impossible well we take
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:29.420]  it the step by that we do it on a flight simulator incredible here's another one
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:33.540]  you know we're gonna show what we try to do with our show is we try to bring it
[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:38.940]  to the average person's level to where you don't have to be a scientist to
[01:48:38.940 --> 01:48:44.540]  figure it out we'll show it to you by the way folks we're gonna skip this
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.420]  network break coming up so we have a full 12 minutes left with the governor
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:50.740]  always precious time with him what a great patriot I gotta say I admire
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:57.340]  Jesse Ventura because he's got courage and he tells it like it is and that's
[01:48:57.340 --> 01:49:01.500]  what we need in this country and now I just admire her Aldo Rivera I admired
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:06.460]  judge Andrew Napolitano even more that they would put their careers on the line
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:10.300]  there have been calls now to fire them it's been big news though as as listeners
[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:15.860]  know remember I was basically dismissed and fired from MSNBC because I opposed
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:20.260]  the war in Iraq oh that's in WikiLeaks that they're the number one recipient of
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:23.700]  mainstream media of bailout money governor what do you think of that
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:29.620]  who MSNBC yeah massive government money oh I wouldn't doubt it but no I was
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:35.500]  essentially fired because I opposed the invasion of Iraq and they they they
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:39.820]  wouldn't allow me on the air they fulfilled their contract but I couldn't
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:45.780]  say anything because my contract said that I could not do any new shows nor
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:53.180]  could I do any satellite or cable television well and so you know that
[01:49:53.180 --> 01:49:58.980]  the censorship is clear that it's out there well again you're seen as a hero
[01:49:58.980 --> 01:50:04.300]  today for what for doing what a man is supposed to do tell the truth follow
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:08.580]  your moral compass and what you believe in and let the chips fall where they may
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:12.580]  just as be done though the heavens fall and but more and more that scene is
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:17.940]  heroic because so many people just cower and go along with whatever they think
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:22.700]  the establishment wants them to do exactly because they're in fear and we
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:32.140]  can't live in fear if we start living in fear then give up the ship are we
[01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:42.940]  supposed to be real Americans then let's stand up tall and be what we're supposed to be absolutely I
[01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:46.420]  mean I can't say it any better let's hurry through these other bullet points
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:50.740]  former NASA engineer reveals that Jesse Ventura damage to the Pentagon didn't
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:54.700]  come from plane strike I can't tell you how many demolition experts have pointed
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:58.700]  out from the few frames they released it's orange and white hot that's not
[01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:03.700]  jet fuel it's red and black as a Navy SEAL demolitions underwater demolition
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:07.220]  expert you know of the cadre of SEALs it's the underwater demolition teams that
[01:51:07.220 --> 01:51:11.700]  are from what I've read correct me if I'm wrong that are the you know most
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:16.860]  focused on explosives I mean that's a white hot orange fireball well not only
[01:51:16.860 --> 01:51:22.580]  that but we look at any of these things when when you end up with metal being
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:30.340]  melted I mean melted when metal melts it takes extreme heat you know you're
[01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:37.060]  talking degrees of 3000 you know and nothing like that could happen to a
[01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:44.180]  normal plane crash it will not get that hot through the normal crashing of a
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:47.660]  plane well it's shot through there's been lots of planes that have crashed
[01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:54.100]  unfortunately well it went through three rings of the Pentagon like a
[01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:58.700]  bunker-busting missile well and that's you know what we'll get into tonight on
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:03.180]  the show unbelievable continuing FBI confirms Pentagon had 84 security
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:07.740]  cameras on 9-11 but no footage shows plane hitting building yeah and they
[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:12.340]  you know they've taken that footage they've under the old premise of national
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:17.540]  security they locked it up and we as citizens are not allowed to see it I
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:23.260]  guess it would traumatize us too much I don't know of course I'm being
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.980]  sarcastic there well folks here but why can't we see if they had all these
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:35.500]  cameras running why in the hell aren't we allowed to see the footage what
[01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:41.260]  possible excuse Alex could they use they don't have one and they have one they
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:45.220]  even went to hotels and gas stations and confiscated it continuing final point
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:49.220]  there's even more on the show 911 Commission lawyer admits to Jesse
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:54.380]  Ventura that government has a penchant for secrecy oh yeah well this was a
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:58.820]  lawyer that was actually on the 9-11 Commission and tonight you'll see me sit
[01:52:58.820 --> 01:53:05.180]  down with her and you know I respect her and I think what she did as an
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:12.420]  individual was okay but what she reveals in just talking to her unintentionally
[01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:19.300]  tells you what a hoax and what a fraud the whole investigation was that it was
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:25.700]  clearly dictated out of the White House and you know the White House wasn't
[01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:30.540]  going to have this investigated at all people seem to forget and have the
[01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:36.580]  short-term memory that immediately following 9-11 the Bush White House
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:41.100]  completely blocked any investigation there wasn't going to be any
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:46.860]  investigation we were simply to believe what they told us and that was good
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:55.020]  enough and I think today even after the 9-11 investigation there were good
[01:53:55.020 --> 01:53:59.180]  things that were revealed out of that investigation you have to find them and
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:05.820]  piece them together but we're no better off learning the truth today after the
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:11.380]  9-11 investigation and the clear example of that Alex is again follow the money
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:17.020]  when Bill Clinton was investigated for whitewater which ultimately they learned
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:23.380]  the president cheated on his wife they spent a hundred million dollars the
[01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:32.980]  initial allocation for the death of 3000 people or more at 9-11 3 million they
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:36.460]  ended up spending 13 and they agreed at the beginning of the commission they
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:40.660]  were gonna look for who was wrong or what happened they were gonna look at
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:47.060]  things to recommend national ID cards but no one got fired if pushing them
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:54.300]  with that enough that these 19 bozos could get on planes with box cutters
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:55:00.380]  and accomplish what they did against our military our air defense system and
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:06.220]  what was called the most safest building in the world the Pentagon they
[01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:14.060]  break it's a no-fly zone why wasn't that plane shot out of the air well we know
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:20.500]  Cheney was in the bunker and basically involved in the standout because the
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:27.540]  Pentagon is in a no-fly zone anything that flies any so close to the Pentagon is
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:34.540]  to be shot out of the air governor what day nothing was shot out of the air we're
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:39.500]  almost out of time very powerful folks you better set your TVO's your DVR's
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:43.460]  this may be the only time you ever see this they know they normally air the
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:47.980]  episodes more than 50 times but they've already deep-six won because of
[01:55:47.980 --> 01:55:54.060]  homeland security and congressional things it really hit a nerve and I mean
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:57.940]  let me tell you no one I know about this episode I'm I'm quite frankly crossing
[01:55:57.940 --> 01:56:01.340]  my fingers I'll be surprised if it even makes it on air there's been a lot of
[01:56:01.340 --> 01:56:04.940]  other stuff behind the scenes that I can't get into but this is real TV
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:08.620]  Ventura and his crew have a lot of courage to bring you this and what's
[01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:15.940]  amazing Alex is even the confession of G Gordon or I'm sorry Howard Hunt yes the
[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:22.580]  confession of Howard Hunt which backs up the book the plausible denial written
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:28.740]  back in the 80s the court case in Florida and yet not one not one bit of it
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:34.780]  is reported in mainstream media yeah you use the confession to the murder of
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:39.740]  John Kennedy well no the show slipped in under the radar but it's it's now
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:44.380]  being targeted in closing I was really proud to be associated with the gulf
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:47.260]  episode I know it was one of your favorites but here's the Guardian
[01:56:47.260 --> 01:56:53.940]  article where they admit there's a plan to buy up 17,000 Mississippi houses just
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:58.140]  to begin to force people completely out of the gulf area Mississippi Louisiana
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:03.380]  you really caught them last week when you talked to the head scientist and they
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:07.580]  had to admit it well you know they're doing it for the good of the people
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:13.100]  Alex they don't want them flooded out anymore yeah you know that's their simple
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:17.860]  explanation it's time for all them people to relocate but they admitted big
[01:57:17.860 --> 01:57:22.900]  business is gonna be there yeah big businesses gonna be staying but they
[01:57:22.900 --> 01:57:28.220]  prefer to have the people going well you haven't left you know what I always
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:33.180]  question certain parts of big business won't do very well unless there's people
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:39.460]  around will they not in the endgame they want to consolidate part of the big
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:44.100]  things down there is the casinos who's gonna go down there and gamble with all
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:49.620]  you can do is look at oil wells governor it's incredible we've only got
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.740]  about a minute left I guess this will be our last interview until six seven
[01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:58.620]  months from now when you get back to Minnesota you're about to go to Mexico

[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:24.220]  would would fix it decriminalize oh completely I mean if they would decriminalize
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:29.620]  drugs that puts the cartels out of business again it's called go back to

[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:00.860]  radio network
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:12.340]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:19.860]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:23.500]  Alex Jones
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:32.380]  alright he's finishing up here in about two minutes and then we're gonna let
[02:00:32.380 --> 02:00:36.180]  governor Ventura go again one of his last interviews of the year before he
[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:39.260]  leaves honored to have him he were finishing up with the fact that you won't
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:43.420]  fly so you got to drive that gauntlet of all the violence on the border with the
[02:00:43.420 --> 02:00:47.620]  drugs and you were making a point about legalize it and that's the end of the
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:50.980]  drug cartels it's the end of the big banks that have been caught laundering
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:54.140]  the money as well you were making a point about Al Capone well at the point
[02:00:54.140 --> 02:00:58.260]  is if you go back and look at history Alex of Al Capone and how the whole
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:03.660]  prohibition of alcohol happened this is identical to it it's the same thing and
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:08.380]  you know prohibiting something doesn't mean it's gonna go away what it means
[02:01:08.380 --> 02:01:12.980]  when government prohibit something it means it will then be run by criminals
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:18.740]  and the criminal element and the less you can have to be run by the criminal
[02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:22.780]  element the better it is for everybody involved and you wouldn't have these
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:27.100]  innocent people being slaughtered at the borders and you wouldn't have people
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:33.020]  afraid to go to Mexico simply because of legalization and it's time to get our
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:37.260]  heads out of the sand I feel bad at what happened in California that they
[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:41.780]  didn't pass it but that fight will continue to go on to because hopefully
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:46.540]  at some point intelligence will prevail here's the headline good luck and we'll
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:49.700]  see you in the spring bye bye all right governor take care God bless there goes
[02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:54.660]  governor Jesse Ventura and here's the headline at info wars dot com governor
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:02:01.500]  Ventura probes Pentagon attack unreleased 9-1-1 video and missing trillions
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:06.860]  conspiracy theories 9-1-1 Pentagon episode airs tonight Friday December 17th
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:12.780]  at 10 p.m. Eastern 9 p.m. Central Standard Time on true TV and I'm gonna be
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:16.380]  really surprised because I know about some of the behind-the-scenes stuff that
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:21.020]  this is gonna make it on air and they've tried their best to give you super
[02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:26.380]  hardcore groundbreaking show and they've done it I mean I will tell you that you
[02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:29.580]  know there's behind-the-scenes stuff like where the super higher ups I'm not
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:36.620]  even gonna get into it I mean they put it in a format where it's for the general
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:40.220]  public it's exciting it's dynamic I don't even think you need to even hype
[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:44.260]  this stuff up it's so incredible it's getting top ratings for true TV I forgot
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:47.620]  to ask Ventura if he's even thinking about doing a season next year I mean I
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:51.100]  pretty much know what he's already told me he's given me some other really big
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:54.900]  news I'm not allowed to talk about dealing with some other issues but as soon
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:58.660]  as that comes out you're gonna definitely hear about it I'm just gonna
[02:02:58.660 --> 02:03:03.780]  leave it effect I'm gonna say nothing more it's hard being on the inside of
[02:03:03.780 --> 02:03:07.300]  so much of this now because I'm in people's confidence and I can't talk
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:14.300]  about it but believe me you want to tune into the night 9 p.m. central 10 p.m.
[02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:18.180]  Eastern and in Ventura such a great guy one thing I wanted to bring up to him
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:21.780]  but on a side note that I'll do next time he's on I guess in six seven months
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:25.820]  when he gets back from Mexico he kind of orbits through for half the year we
[02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:29.060]  always enjoy getting to hang out and have him on the show and talk on the phone
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:33.060]  and stuff he's just a great guy kind of like a John Wayne type character in
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:36.940]  person no in Ventura you can tell why he was a movie star and a top wrestler and
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:44.860]  a governor I mean you know he's got that he's got that's that charisma I've got
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:48.060]  to know a lot of other Hollywood people and folks a powerful charisma and when
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:50.900]  you're with them in person you really figure out why they're quote a star as
[02:03:50.900 --> 02:03:55.420]  they say because they've just got that electric you know dynamic dynamism
[02:03:55.420 --> 02:04:03.380]  about them but I did want to put him on the hot seat little which I know he
[02:04:03.380 --> 02:04:07.100]  doesn't mind and because I know how Ventura's brain works now and he's
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:10.340]  learning more all the time he has a lot more knowledge and I do in many areas I
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:14.180]  have more knowledge and he does in other areas but him saying and it was in a
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.020]  book signing a few months because it was kind of tongue-in-cheek but I want to
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:22.260]  get his full view on it about hey I might run if Bloomberg financed me you
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:27.580]  know for president and you know he said he might endorse Bloomberg because he's
[02:04:27.580 --> 02:04:30.860]  not part of the two parties you know that's his idea break the two parties
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:34.740]  with Bloomberg he's a Democrat on steroids totally against guns on
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:38.460]  insider so I wanted to tell Ventura that maybe I'll call him today and tell him
[02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:41.820]  off air because I just haven't gotten around bringing that up to him but
[02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:46.460]  that's my only point but I know he'll hear about it anyway so it doesn't matter
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:50.780]  because I know that a lot of great folks like Breverman and Tyrell are listening
[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:54.580]  right now want to give a shout-out to those guys as well and just say
[02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:58.300]  congratulations on putting groundbreaking stuff on television Bob
[02:04:58.300 --> 02:05:01.300]  Chapman's coming up stay with us

[02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:34.300]  over a host of issues with Bob Chapman but at the bottom of the hour I want to
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:38.940]  get into a subject because I want to collect my thoughts on this I need to
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:43.380]  write some notes on I've got all the ideas the information the facts that
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:48.940]  I've researched and it only further confirms that Hitchens article Christopher
[02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:53.420]  Hitchens latest Nixon tape buries Kissinger reputation where they're
[02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:58.500]  talking about the Soviets persecuting and killing Jews in the 70s in Russia
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:04.420]  Kissinger says it's not a problem no big deal and how it goes into the mindset
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:09.300]  of Zbigniew Brzezinski you know writing about how our government funded
[02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:14.020]  Pol Pot you know we didn't have to kill these people Pol Pot did it for us I
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:19.260]  mean they brag member Kissinger is openly written that soldiers are dumb
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:24.180]  animals you know police are dumb animals I mean they sit there they think
[02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:28.180]  you're morons destroying your own freedom in your own future and I want to
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:33.620]  get into this and and talk about the global hierarchy that we're dealing
[02:09:33.620 --> 02:09:39.420]  with here so that's coming up because I see this over and over again and I'm
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.460]  gonna leave it at this and get into it at the bottom of the hour with Bob I
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:45.420]  want to cover the economy wiki leaks some other issues first with Bob Chapman
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:49.180]  and then I want to have Bob on for this because he's talked about a lot of this
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:53.140]  and it's one of the people out there that from his deep research shares my
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:58.140]  view and understanding of this and I haven't even really gotten to the point
[02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:02.860]  I'm gonna be making it's just that you go back to World War two and there's been
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:07.180]  books written about this by Jewish professors and others that the Zionist
[02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:13.020]  in Israel or who are already starting to move into the area they they would
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:16.700]  make Jews pay a million dollars to get out of Germany and they did deals so
[02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:21.860]  Jews couldn't get into the United States or England and they can only go and
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:28.900]  there's quotes like a cow in Palestine is worth more than all the Jews in
[02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:34.540]  Europe if those Jews don't come to Israel I mean it's like this with every
[02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:38.380]  group it's it's a criminal organization on top claiming it's doing all this for
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:41.460]  the people under it just like our government does or the Chinese
[02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:45.220]  government does but really it's an excuse to feed on them it's like the
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:49.340]  Israelis radiating a hundred and ten thousand Jewish children I mean this is
[02:10:49.340 --> 02:10:53.180]  real folks like our government shooting up kids in Guatemala with syphilis that
[02:10:53.180 --> 02:10:56.860]  just came out this year I mean this stuff's so horrible and then you got to
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:11:00.900]  ask yourself well who really runs Israel see because I look at Prince Philip and
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:06.860]  Ted Turner and I look at the Dutch royalty they're all into Nazism Ted
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:10.940]  Turner calls it liberal but it's population reduction but that goes back
[02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:15.980]  to real Nazis like Prince Philip Prince Bernhard and then people say oh you're
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:20.540]  saying the Nazis run things what I'm saying is it's eugenics the Rockefellers
[02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:26.580]  did fund Hitler that's mainline news and the eugenics they did fund the Kaiser
[02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:30.980]  Wilhelm Institute they're always behind it Margaret Sanger said we got a higher
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:34.660]  blacks to be our fronts so we can kill these animals and weeds and abort them
[02:11:34.660 --> 02:11:39.220]  they kill 51% of blacks in this country before they're born seeing they pose as
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:43.860]  liberals and then call us racist when we criticize big government so I just
[02:11:43.860 --> 02:11:48.660]  report on what I know I don't even call it Nazism so much Hitler was a
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:53.180]  aberration according to the globalist of their overall eugenics plan he was a
[02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:56.860]  bad son for those that know what a bad son is you have a great myrtle tree and
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:00.300]  oak tree the Acorns or whatever will grow up little trees every year you got
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:04.540]  to cut them he was a bad son Bob I want to get into this more later in the hour
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:07.660]  because I want to read through these articles with you but I start talking
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:11.540]  about something I go ahead and get into it this is just such an important issue
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:16.100]  that's really been hidden and you got the Nazi camp out there the Catholic
[02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:19.380]  bashing camp you know all these different camps that obsess over it's this
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:25.140]  group it's that group but for my study it's a scientific eugenics elite and it
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:29.780]  doesn't matter of their Chinese German Jewish Japanese Mexican by the way
[02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:35.340]  Mexico adopted sterilization in the 30s it's a group of people who think they're
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:40.820]  God your your brief comment on that before we get into the other news I'm
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:46.420]  going to say and because you covered it so well is that my own personal
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:52.900]  experience when I was connected to people who had been in the hierarchy in
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:59.660]  Germany during the war and I got to know some of them very very well and they
[02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:06.500]  of course were hooked up with Canaris who ran foreign intelligence and in the
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:16.620]  1930s Adolf Hitler was shipping SS people to Palestine to infiltrate and I
[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:24.980]  think they're there today in the form of their children and grandchildren and so
[02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:30.260]  there was a deliberate attempt by the German government during the 1930s in
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:40.780]  probably in the 40s too and I got this straight from two generals Bob yes please
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:50.060]  continue the two generals were Leon de Grel and general Ramo Ramo was the man
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:55.340]  who surrendered Berlin to the Russians and I knew them quite well and they both
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:14:00.620]  told me the same thing at separate times and we were you know talking about
[02:14:00.620 --> 02:14:07.020]  world politics and that sort of thing but I'm not a fundee on this but that
[02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:10.940]  would just happen to be one of my personal experiences and outgrowth of
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:16.740]  being involved in counterintelligence well we know it's now come out in
[02:14:16.740 --> 02:14:22.220]  history books that there was a deal where they would only let Jews get out to
[02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:27.500]  Israel and this is so diabolical it's that no one would ever suspect that it's
[02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:33.380]  pure genius is what it is pure evil genius tell us what the generals told
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:36.820]  you I mean the reason I interrupted I heard a crackle on your line and thought
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:41.460]  it had disconnected it sounded like a disconnection in my ear I guess they may
[02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:44.020]  be thinking about this connecting you right now Bob I don't think you've ever
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:50.380]  talked about this before no I haven't and about gentlemen are dead now and I
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:55.980]  suppose I can talk about it but they just simply told me that and how it came
[02:14:55.980 --> 02:15:01.940]  up as I remember now is that they were citing the fact and they were both
[02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:08.420]  still Nazis I mean they they believed in in the the fascist government of
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:13.900]  Germany and they didn't till they died and they were telling me about the
[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:20.980]  Grand Mufti of Jerusalem who had sent several divisions of men to fight on
[02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:27.140]  the Eastern Front and they were accompanied by the Mullahs and all their
[02:15:27.140 --> 02:15:32.540]  own food and in all of the things that that separate Muslim group would need
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:37.460]  and how they had fought quite valiantly against the Russians and that's how it
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.060]  came up that that's how it came up the first time the second time was another
[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:48.060]  conversation but I saw these people fairly frequently over a 10-15 year
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:54.340]  period so there were a lot of other things I I picked up as well but not to
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:57.900]  do with this subject well that's because they were using the Nazis here in the
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:01.540]  US but also in Europe to fight the Russians during the Cold War and that's
[02:16:01.540 --> 02:16:08.620]  when you were there because I keep keep watching the so-called Israeli
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:12.260]  leadership always claiming how much they love Jews love Israel but then in
[02:16:12.260 --> 02:16:18.260]  every case we actually see the opposite going on behind the scenes there's
[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:22.860]  something very sophisticated going on in all of this and then you got the
[02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:26.820]  Rockefellers claiming they love all these Jewish causes but they were Nazis
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:31.060]  at the time they're Nazis today they funded the whole deal I mean I guess
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:35.620]  it's that the globalists are masters of funding all the all the sides or is it
[02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:42.660]  more sophisticated no they find both sides usually there's two sides sometimes
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:49.060]  is three or four but usually two and that goes back deeply into history this
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:55.740]  is nothing new in and you know the people who are the power behind governments
[02:16:55.740 --> 02:17:00.940]  or whatever they have always especially when they get in financial trouble so
[02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:07.460]  well we're gonna have another wall and so they tell the the the person who's
[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:11.180]  running Rome at the time look you know this this whole economy is gonna fall
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:16.140]  apart you better go over and kick the crap out of those goals over there or
[02:17:16.140 --> 02:17:20.500]  whatever we'll be able to have a war going well Bob since we got into this
[02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:23.260]  now let's cover it now we'll hit the economy and wiki leaks other
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:28.540]  developments at the end of the hour I don't know if you saw this Christopher
[02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:33.140]  Hitchens report Christopher Hitchens latest Nixon tape berries Kissinger
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:37.100]  reputation these tapes are public we can't play them there's so much Nixon
[02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:41.820]  cussing I'm not even gonna attempt to beep it out but we know in the end
[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:47.380]  Kissinger set up Nixon but and I would think this that this was just Kissinger
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:51.820]  going along with Nixon and playing like he was an anti-Semite if I hadn't gotten
[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:55.620]  the intel from you and Anthony Sutton and countless others that he was a
[02:17:55.620 --> 02:18:00.340]  Russian agent that's now coming out mainstream news that he was a Rothschild
[02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:06.540]  agent his code name was what bore or the bore and that the other statements and
[02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:10.180]  other things kissing your dinner now he's behind the eugenics and it turned
[02:18:10.180 --> 02:18:15.340]  out he was behind earlier helping ship the radiation systems machines over to
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:19.580]  Israel I mean this guy who is this guy from your deep research I mean what is
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:23.900]  going on with him saying that hey let the Russians kill Jews it's you know we
[02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:30.220]  don't care and now Jewish groups are attacking Hitchens for criticizing him
[02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:34.460]  well that's understandable because I don't think that they understand the
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:40.540]  full import of what this man is he's a man for all seasons he is whatever you
[02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:46.100]  want him to be if he's with a group of Catholics oh he loves Catholics if he's
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:50.500]  with a group of black people he loves them as well and he's with Jewish people
[02:18:50.500 --> 02:18:54.420]  he loves them as well but he's diabolically evil and he's also a
[02:18:54.420 --> 02:19:02.500]  pervert and that's from your intelligence sources absolutely in fact I was in
[02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:08.020]  Rome one time and it just happened I was going over to a
[02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:13.020]  observatory mono which is a newspaper there and I was going over with a
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:20.460]  couple of other people some of who I had picked up with intelligence and they
[02:19:20.460 --> 02:19:25.220]  was a newspaper on the stand and it said in Italian hide your children Henry
[02:19:25.220 --> 02:19:32.780]  Kissinger is coming to town I'll never forget it I was I was undestruck all
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:39.020]  right let's come back and I'm gonna give folks my view on this whole situation
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:41.940]  I'm gonna get Bob Chapman to take them we're getting into the economy and a
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:48.060]  host of other issues but I mean where's the ADL with Israel radiating 110,000
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:55.580]  of their own children whore Sephardic you know darker-skinned Jews I mean what's
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:20:02.260]  going on here folks this is Nazism this is eugenics they ride back men take

[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:09.500]  all right going back to Bob Chapman then we're getting into the economy and a
[02:24:09.500 --> 02:24:15.160]  lot more coming up there's thousands of data points here so it's hard to give
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:19.140]  people a full image of this until they've studied it but over and over again
[02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:23.140]  how Turner turns out to be a fed the big white supremacist who attacked yours
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:27.980]  truly on an almost daily basis it comes out news oh these Klan groups are Nazi
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:30.380]  groups that marks through black neighborhoods turns out they're all
[02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:35.380]  feds they're all cops there's no one in the group I mean that's come out in the
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:40.820]  Orlando news other newspapers in Ohio this stuff comes out and then it's
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:45.620]  used to create racial division and then you've got the Southern Poverty Law
[02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:49.540]  Center with their people inside Elohim City running it connected to McVeigh I
[02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:53.940]  mean it just goes on and on but studying history if you go back people
[02:24:53.940 --> 02:24:57.780]  following the Bible in the dark ages would not allow Christians to lend money
[02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:06.100]  it was called usury but the Royals in Spain France and other areas they
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:09.940]  learned how to let an unpopular minority do it claiming it was okay under
[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:13.380]  their religion and this is in mainline history books they would have then have
[02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:17.220]  pogroms every fifty hundred years you know it varied and and rob them of the
[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:23.860]  wealth and so they kind of just chose some of the Jewish moneylenders who
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:27.180]  would kind of run pawn shops that's how it started that's where the Rothschilds
[02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:30.380]  came from in Germany and then they would set that up now since then the
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:33.540]  Rothschilds have married in with the royalty and you know we're definitely up
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:37.340]  there at the top of the pyramid but then you see them funding eugenics you see
[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:41.340]  them funding and it's more than just funding both sides I mean why would
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:45.580]  Israel take a hundred and ten thousand Sephardic Jewish children and kill
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:49.580]  many of them on the radiation and maim others and then you add all these other
[02:25:49.580 --> 02:25:53.580]  and you've got Kissinger there's been other famous quotes you know in the
[02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:57.700]  Israeli news where the light-skinned Israelis and you'll make fun of the
[02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:01.260]  dark-skinned Israelis I mean they have a really racist name it's the same name
[02:26:01.260 --> 02:26:05.540]  they use for black people here in this country of racist use and we see
[02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:09.540]  Kissinger saying ask so what if they kill all the Jews and these are on tape
[02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:16.540]  you know in Russia it's just all part of this cold-bloodedness and so so that's
[02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:19.860]  why it's used as a political weapon anti-Semitism against those who aren't
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:24.100]  anti-Semitic and then Jews who are on the grass roots aren't involved in any
[02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:28.260]  corruption or anything it's basically a Jewish mafia who probably aren't even
[02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:34.660]  Jewish just parading around using this as a weapon and at the end of the day
[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:38.220]  they're just globalists who are into eugenics like all these other elite
[02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:42.820]  groups and once you realize that it depoliticizes it and you can see clearly
[02:26:42.820 --> 02:26:47.780]  what's happening Bob Chapman your comments on what I just said and it
[02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:55.580]  de-religiousize is it if there's such a word and and that's very important in
[02:26:55.580 --> 02:27:02.620]  Israel and we have many people who are Jewish subscribers there's a
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:07.740]  distinction and there always has been between the people who came from
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:14.900]  Europe and Eastern Europe generally called the Askenazi and in the Shabbat
[02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:21.100]  Jews who are we'll call the Mediterranean Jews who are darker in
[02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:30.580]  complexion and they're different and they in some parts believe in Judaism in
[02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:35.380]  a different way a slightly different way they've done the DNA test they've done
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:41.500]  the DNA test they have a lot more of the original you know Hebrew blood they
[02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:47.940]  probably have 98% more yeah and then there was an operation Moses that
[02:27:47.940 --> 02:27:55.060]  went on during the 19 early 1980s and they took the Fallasha Jews from
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:28:01.180]  Ethiopia and they brought them to Israel and they treated terribly and so there
[02:28:01.180 --> 02:28:07.980]  is a social pecking order there and you find that in most countries yeah and in
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:14.420]  Latin America where I spent a lot of time in recent years people who are
[02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:22.140]  light of skinned and have hazel or blue eyes tend to like to marry with people
[02:28:22.140 --> 02:28:30.660]  who look the same generally speaking and so there is this difference in people
[02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:35.140]  and what they are what they want to continue to be and it is racism there's
[02:28:35.140 --> 02:28:41.220]  no question and the point is this is a human condition and there's another
[02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:44.900]  level to it that's why the federal government and Castine admits this
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:50.540]  uncast funds all this infighting with each other because you know if people
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:53.620]  think it's the Catholics that run it or it's the Jews or it's the Masons no it's
[02:28:53.620 --> 02:28:57.660]  corrupt people at the top of all these organizations that have just become
[02:28:57.660 --> 02:29:01.620]  basically mafias and they're feeding on the groups under them who think that
[02:29:01.620 --> 02:29:07.580]  they're there to protect them was a good example is a balkanization of Eastern
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:12.780]  Europe which started in the 1500s and the reason that the the British and
[02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:19.700]  others Germans as well would balkanize countries in other words they take an
[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:27.380]  area and where there were three different tribal groups and they were
[02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:33.020]  very different and and they would make them into a country so that they could
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:37.540]  have war and demand and how they did that was they have the guys in the right
[02:29:37.540 --> 02:29:41.540]  attack the guys in the left in finance both sides stay there keep breaking that
[02:29:41.540 --> 02:29:44.660]  down on the other side and now they've set that up in America they claim
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:47.740]  multiculturalism is about getting along but it's really all about being
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:52.620]  different and hating each other we'll be right back we're on the march the

[02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:30.820]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather

[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:48.060]  okay we've got a lot to cover and a short time to get there made off last
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:52.660]  weekend as you know his son hangs himself with a dog collar if you believe
[02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:56.540]  that again I got a bridge on Pluto I'm happy to sell you but I want to get Bob's
[02:35:56.540 --> 02:35:59.460]  take on it I don't want to prejudice his view I want to get his real view but
[02:35:59.460 --> 02:36:03.460]  that looks very suspicious this looks like a message is being sent suddenly
[02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:08.380]  oh that hundred billion dollars or so we're actually finding a lot of it now
[02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:14.380]  big mega banks and Bob Chapman has been dead on on this first telling us about
[02:36:14.380 --> 02:36:18.540]  made-off years before it came down the SEC knew all about it for 11 years
[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:22.940]  protecting what's going on with the made-off son dying and now this money
[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:27.700]  being discovered are some are some people sending messages I think they
[02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:36.820]  are and I quite frankly I don't know whether his son was murdered or not
[02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:44.220]  certainly the circumstances were very strange I think the medical
[02:36:44.220 --> 02:36:48.460]  examiner in New York could tell us more if they would but you never know when
[02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:53.660]  you're going to get the true story it's like when Nelson Rockefeller died he had
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:58.900]  a heart attack when in fact he didn't because it was a gold gold gold a badge
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:06.340]  detective who was at the scene of the crime scene of the the death and he had
[02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:13.940]  been using what they call poppers and and it killed him these are things that
[02:37:13.940 --> 02:37:21.540]  that caught this is a chemical that causes an upward rush in your in your
[02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:27.820]  blood system and people like to use those when they're doing things which I
[02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:35.020]  will get into but anyway we'll never know I don't think but it could go either
[02:37:35.020 --> 02:37:40.260]  way I just don't know at this point I haven't I've got a guy in New York who's
[02:37:40.260 --> 02:37:47.220]  really good and he's reserving judgment on perhaps no more later and he's been
[02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:52.780]  very careful lately because I print what he tells me in the publication and I
[02:37:52.780 --> 02:37:57.580]  think he's afraid someone might catch on to who he is but the discovery of the
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:07.060]  money is very very important and this by naming this Ponzi scheme under the law
[02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:13.540]  not only can they go back and get money from people who received a profit or
[02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:20.660]  received monies when nobody else did or very few did and that is being applied
[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:27.420]  to other cases now and I came across one here just recently where letters of
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:33.780]  being sent by the receivers in the bankruptcy of this and other Ponzi scheme
[02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:39.140]  you know you invested a hundred thousand you got a hundred and three back you
[02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:43.500]  have to give us the three back because that has to go to the people who didn't
[02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:49.820]  get out like you did you were lucky they weren't that sort of thing and so that's
[02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:56.060]  going to be applied to future Ponzi schemes I noticed today to overstock
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:02.460]  which has been chasing the naked shorts for years and finally I think they're
[02:39:02.460 --> 02:39:09.700]  going to file a Rico action against Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase for
[02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:13.780]  naked shorting of their stock and trying to destroy their company so there's a
[02:39:13.780 --> 02:39:19.700]  lot of things going on there yes this made off but how about what the FBI is
[02:39:19.700 --> 02:39:25.340]  doing they're going to subpoena 2,000 people I mean it's incredible a crime
[02:39:25.340 --> 02:39:31.340]  that goes on and of course I was on Wall Street for 28 years and I sorry but I
[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:35.820]  didn't see anything like this I mean these people are brazen they just don't
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:40.620]  care anymore let's go over this Reuters article made off insider a state giving
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:45.980]  back 7.2 billion the estate of made off insider Jeffrey Pick our agreed to get
[02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:51.140]  back 7.2 billion to settle a shovel claims on Friday significantly boosting
[02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:56.100]  the amount available to repay thousands of investors swindled in the epic fraud
[02:39:56.100 --> 02:40:02.420]  so the Sun dies and now we start seeing big movement continuing with the economy
[02:40:02.420 --> 02:40:07.140]  in a moment but what do you think of the El Paso Times reporting Mexican drone
[02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:11.740]  crashes in the backyard of El Paso home we've seen all the video of Mexican
[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:16.500]  helicopters flying deep inside the US we know the Mexican military is dealing a
[02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:22.380]  lot of the drugs committing assassinations on both sides and can you
[02:40:22.380 --> 02:40:28.420]  imagine what would happen if a US drone crashed on their side well I gotta tell
[02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:32.460]  you something Alex I don't think much had happened because all the drones come from
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:36.500]  the United States and they must give them to Mexico and now we know that they
[02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:43.300]  have given them to Mexico and now we know that one went astray so we know
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:50.060]  that for sure hopefully they are trying to catch the NACO traficantes who are
[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:55.660]  doing all this bad stuff and and perhaps the people who were smuggling and
[02:40:55.660 --> 02:41:01.780]  illegal aliens into the United States as well as drugs that land route is is
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:07.900]  wide open and you live in Texas I don't have to tell you and if Americans
[02:41:07.900 --> 02:41:11.780]  weren't using those drugs it wouldn't be any market for them and that's what the
[02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:17.100]  foreign is contend and I think they got a good point let's stop using drugs
[02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:21.980]  American and we won't have to worry about all this let's continue years years
[02:41:21.980 --> 02:41:26.300]  the Mexicans have looked the other way 30 billion dollars a year going into the
[02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:32.420]  economy that's a lot of money it's number two after the petrochemical
[02:41:32.420 --> 02:41:37.020]  industry and then the money is going back from legal and illegal aliens to
[02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:44.980]  Mexico is about 22 23 billion a year and any you have the tourists that's about
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:51.060]  17 billion a year so you can get a little an overview of why that's important
[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:59.340]  to the Mexican economy Bob I want to look at the TSA and the whole police state
[02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:02.900]  grab before we get back into the economy we published an article yesterday
[02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:06.620]  because a caller pointed it out that the unions all over the country no law
[02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:11.660]  Homeland Security is just ordering them to enroll the millions of union people
[02:42:11.660 --> 02:42:20.300]  in a biometric card drug testing for steel workers school workers trash men
[02:42:20.300 --> 02:42:25.280]  you name it and now Watson has discovered that Fox News 23 is reporting
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:30.100]  but we have a detailed article on it FBI agents trained garbage collectors to
[02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:35.020]  report suspicious activity or suspicions and it says nationwide waste
[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:39.860]  watch spy program another alarming reminder of society and terminal decay
[02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:44.140]  former FBI agents are helping local authorities train thousands of garbage
[02:42:44.140 --> 02:42:48.620]  collectors across the country as a nationwide internal spy force to report
[02:42:48.620 --> 02:42:52.580]  suspicious activity to police yet another example how America is turning
[02:42:52.580 --> 02:42:56.980]  into East German Stasi informant society as the country decays from within but
[02:42:56.980 --> 02:43:00.620]  then meanwhile the hijackers are trained at US bases and we're all a lucky the
[02:43:00.620 --> 02:43:04.140]  head of al-Qaeda is hanging out at the Pentagon I called the FBI last week the
[02:43:04.140 --> 02:43:07.180]  threat fusion center number the FBI was running it and they didn't want to hear
[02:43:07.180 --> 02:43:12.180]  about it continuing so I'm reporting real in real stuff local news reports out
[02:43:12.180 --> 02:43:16.340]  of all many concerning the new waste watch program in guilty until proven
[02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:19.620]  innocent garbage collectors are trained by former FBI agents to look for
[02:43:19.620 --> 02:43:23.420]  suspicious activity and of course that'll be just digging through all your
[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:30.980]  stuff stealing data everything we're replete with nodding drones expressing
[02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:35.180]  how delighted they were they were being spied on by their fellow Americans your
[02:43:35.180 --> 02:43:39.020]  local trash man will help prevent crime now they admit they have the cable guys
[02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:42.900]  in your house spying on you and of course it's always for terror first then a
[02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:46.780]  week later are they spanking their kids do you smell marijuana do you see firearms
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:52.260]  they've they've got the real estate agents now all the time people get police
[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:55.740]  called on them for reloading equipment in their garage because that looks
[02:43:55.740 --> 02:44:00.020]  suspicious I mean this is getting insane this article just came out at
[02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:04.500]  prisonplanet.com folks get it to drugs get it to everybody this is big FBI
[02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:08.540]  agents trained garbage collectors report suspicious activity Bob Chapman your
[02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:15.020]  take on this and the TSA homeland security telescreens going and now 9,000
[02:44:15.020 --> 02:44:22.500]  stores not just 800 Walmart's the I mean I mean it's it's like a nightmare it was
[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:27.900]  all laid out by the people who used to run East Germany and when the wall came
[02:44:27.900 --> 02:44:32.340]  down they recruited them paid them quite a bit of money and including Marcus
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:39.540]  Wolf who was a monster and in none of the wherever prosecuted for anything I
[02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:45.140]  mean with all the things that they did the murders and the torches and
[02:44:45.140 --> 02:44:52.900]  everything and they showed them in the in Washington how you would do what
[02:44:52.900 --> 02:45:00.060]  they're doing right now this spying network and when the wall came down as
[02:45:00.060 --> 02:45:05.820]  well there were hundreds of thousands of people living in what was previously
[02:45:05.820 --> 02:45:14.420]  Western Germany who had been spying in behalf of Eastern Germany never mind the
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:19.860]  hundreds of thousands of Eastern Germany who was buying on each other in fact the
[02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:25.220]  Western German government which is the government we have today ordered the
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:29.740]  the records destroyed yeah the Western government I went along with it but but
[02:45:29.740 --> 02:45:34.580]  Bob this is now they're going to anybody who's under city or county control or
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:40.660]  private unions and saying it is your job to not just dump trash in but spy on it
[02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:46.140]  and the cable guys have been recruited I mean this is outrageous and meanwhile
[02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:50.180]  we know who's committing the crime we know CIA aircraft crash all the time
[02:45:50.180 --> 02:45:54.060]  full of drugs I mean I'm sick of it I'm so I want to walk up to every cop out
[02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:57.420]  there and every bureaucrat go I know you work for drug dealing scum it came out
[02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:01.740]  in the WikiLeaks this week in the Houston news that Dincor was running kidnap
[02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:07.300]  little boys and nobody gets in trouble but they'll freak out over marijuana I'm
[02:46:07.300 --> 02:46:14.140]  sick of it go ahead well Dincor has been nabbed in a giant part prostitution
[02:46:14.140 --> 02:46:21.260]  ring in Serbia after the war which is 10 or 12 years ago and the guys that took
[02:46:21.260 --> 02:46:31.060]  over and also the Muslims they're running the drugs from Afghanistan into
[02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:35.700]  Europe oh now it's come out that the KLA thousands and thousands men women
[02:46:35.700 --> 02:46:40.780]  children they just grabbed the Serbs and cut their organs out and I guess
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:46.660]  that's what our allies did that's right and of all places most of them were
[02:46:46.660 --> 02:46:52.980]  shipped to Israel because they offer the highest price but the point is why are
[02:46:52.980 --> 02:46:56.220]  they doing what they're doing in America and they're setting up the same kind of
[02:46:56.220 --> 02:47:03.140]  system as they had in Soviet Russia and all of the satellites and in particularly
[02:47:03.140 --> 02:47:08.260]  Eastern Germany which is probably most of the most effective counterintelligence
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:15.500]  operation and intelligence operation in that Soviet family so to speak and so
[02:47:15.500 --> 02:47:20.380]  that's what we got today and I've written about it before I started coming
[02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:26.420]  others did too but not many and but that's always a way and they're gonna
[02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:33.900]  try to create an atmosphere like they did with the Hitler Junga in Germany spy
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:37.940]  on your parents I mean it's incredible and this is what it's coming to no no
[02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:42.980]  no I've got videos in Austin news where they said 200 bucks the biggest bonus
[02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:46.300]  for turning in mommy and daddy and the parents are like oh I love putting my
[02:47:46.300 --> 02:47:50.300]  child in public school where they're taught to spy on me I mean it's just
[02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:56.660]  like you said naked brazen blatant it's just so super charged in your face
[02:47:56.660 --> 02:48:01.060]  leering and we know they're staged in the terror attacks these people are
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:06.860]  maniacs and now the dollar devaluations accelerating what's your take on the
[02:48:06.860 --> 02:48:11.420]  Chinese and Russians making good on their two week old announcement to only do
[02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:16.620]  trade with each other in the Chinese currency do you agree with a lot of
[02:48:16.620 --> 02:48:20.220]  analysts that this year is probably the year that the dollar is already dying as
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:23.580]  the World Reserve currency but by the end of this next year coming up it's
[02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:28.580]  gonna be basically official well we predicted that and I think there's a
[02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:34.380]  good chance of that and I think that there's going to be strength in the
[02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:40.780]  dollar going into the first quarter and the reason why is the debt refunding in
[02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:45.940]  the first quarter that has to happen in Europe and that would tend to make the
[02:48:45.940 --> 02:48:51.340]  euro and in other European countries currencies and don't forget there's only
[02:48:51.340 --> 02:48:59.380]  16 members in the euro and there's 27 countries in the European Union so there's
[02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:04.740]  other currencies as well and they're going to be under pressure because the
[02:49:04.740 --> 02:49:09.980]  euro is and the others by proxy so to speak or by contagion it probably a
[02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:14.620]  better word and that's going to put pressure on the euro again during the
[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:21.740]  first quarter until a giant part of a very large yearly refinancing is done
[02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:27.580]  and the US is facing the same thing but it's laid out more over the year rather
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:34.380]  than the first quarter so I think you can't wait the dollar should not become
[02:49:34.380 --> 02:49:40.820]  a lot lower until late in the first quarter going into the second quarter
[02:49:40.820 --> 02:49:44.660]  now you've talked about inflation starting to accelerate now we see
[02:49:44.660 --> 02:49:49.020]  interest rates going up to the general public for housing and loans but even
[02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:53.740]  though the supposed rate is still the same we see oil going up to 92 dollars
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:59.580]  today what's your view on that well I think oil is being deliberately
[02:49:59.580 --> 02:50:05.580]  manipulated up when it's not hard for the people who who produce oil to do
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:10.380]  that they're all countries with the exception of oh maybe 20 or 30 non
[02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:15.500]  countries that produce large amounts of oil and so it's it's very easy to
[02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:21.580]  manipulate and the long side on the market is very very strong and so
[02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:28.100]  where are they gonna stop what I don't know and I think that people who
[02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:34.140]  produce oil believe that they should be receiving more for their oil because of
[02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:39.740]  the diminuent diminuation of the value of the dollar and they're right they do
[02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:44.740]  deserve a higher price than they were getting I think a bottom on oil is at
[02:50:44.740 --> 02:50:50.700]  least in the format that we're in now is probably 60 65 dollars a barrel yes
[02:50:50.700 --> 02:50:55.020]  we're approaching a hundred it'll probably go there because they want it
[02:50:55.020 --> 02:50:59.220]  there stay there stay there we gotta go to break I got more financial questions

[02:55:48.420 --> 02:55:52.460]  list of radio specials from Alex Jones that's the smoking deals that are five
[02:55:52.460 --> 02:56:00.460]  to ten points on average lower than what their main prices are 800 686 2237 to
[02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:03.460]  find out about the loss leaders and the best deals and don't wait to get into
[02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:07.660]  gold and silver briefly Bob Chapman what's your view on golden silver what
[02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:12.380]  have they been up to lately trying to suppress it unsuccessfully well the
[02:56:12.380 --> 02:56:18.540]  February contract right now is up 650 and the March contract up 44 cents and
[02:56:18.540 --> 02:56:23.300]  they're going to be trading for another couple of hours and it looks like we may
[02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:28.180]  be ending this mini correction and all your people out there got to realize
[02:56:28.180 --> 02:56:33.740]  that the gold and silver have always been a volatile market and now they're
[02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:37.300]  even more volatile than ever because you have more people getting involved not
[02:56:37.300 --> 02:56:41.460]  particularly from the United States but particularly from Europe and Asia that
[02:56:41.460 --> 02:56:47.020]  haven't been big buyers in the last 30 years or big buyers ever and so there's
[02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:50.340]  a lot of volatility at the U.S. government other central banks in the
[02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:54.820]  market manipulating it it's something you got to put up with and you don't look
[02:56:54.820 --> 02:57:00.660]  at it every day you don't trade it you go long and you stay long and don't think
[02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:05.260]  about it if you want to make changes from time to time any of your coins or
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:09.780]  your boony in your stock for some reason you do so but for all intents and
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:14.700]  purposes you buy and you hold it and you don't worry about gold going from
[02:57:14.700 --> 02:57:20.700]  1400 to 1375 or whatever it is or silver going for because if you look at
[02:57:20.700 --> 02:57:24.860]  that if you look at the 750 if you look at the yearly graph versus the 10-year
[02:57:24.860 --> 02:57:30.740]  it's just going straight up that's right it's been going there for 10 years
[02:57:30.740 --> 02:57:38.300]  19 and point six percent appreciation compounded in gold million over the last
[02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:43.260]  10 years it does not get any better than that and this is only the end of phase
[02:57:43.260 --> 02:57:48.260]  one the beginning of phase two there'll be three or four phases in this Ron Paul
[02:57:48.260 --> 02:57:53.940]  and I have both talked about six thousand dollar gold price for backing new
[02:57:53.940 --> 02:58:00.380]  backing on a dollar it's very very possible others are predicting four
[02:58:00.380 --> 02:58:04.980]  thousand some more we won't know until we get there but it's going to be up in
[02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:10.740]  that realm so to speak and so you're gonna see silver trading at one or two
[02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:14.980]  hundred dollars in that I don't know all I know is it's going higher all I know
[02:58:14.980 --> 02:58:18.460]  is they're devaluing currencies worldwide not just the dollar and so
[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:22.060]  you're gonna see oil go up all of it now if you want to call Midas resources
