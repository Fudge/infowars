[00:18.960 --> 00:30.360]  Texas Alex Jones often imitated and successfully duplicated that is my goal
[00:30.360 --> 00:34.480]  to get people involved to alert the population of the threat of the global
[00:34.480 --> 00:38.100]  crime syndicate the private banking syndicate to shadow the left-right
[00:38.100 --> 00:41.720]  paradigm to get the people of the planet and the United States saying no to the
[00:41.720 --> 00:49.600]  new world order so often imitated and duplicated that is our goal thank you
[00:49.600 --> 00:55.280]  so much for joining us today we are live it is twins Wednesday the 21st day of
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.240]  April 2010 and we're going to be live here for the next four hours
[01:01.240 --> 01:05.800]  Catherine Austin Fitz was on with us a few weeks ago formerly headed up a
[01:05.800 --> 01:10.760]  HUD and she's an expert on the new world order and the criminal banking cartel
[01:10.760 --> 01:14.640]  that is setting up a worldwide dictatorship a financial dictatorship
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.840]  backed up with paramilitary forces and a green Gaia neo-futalistic surf system
[01:20.840 --> 01:25.480]  she'll be joining us in the third hour in the fourth hour haven't had him on in
[01:25.480 --> 01:30.760]  years you know years just slipped past us and he was the head of the FBI in
[01:30.760 --> 01:34.680]  Southern California with thousands of agents under him he was the head of the
[01:34.680 --> 01:40.240]  FBI in Dallas before that and I want to get him on about a host of issues
[01:40.240 --> 01:51.840]  he is in the hospital and has had cancer Ted Gunderson will be joining us from an
[01:51.840 --> 01:54.960]  undisclosed location he's had people trying to kill him but he is in a
[01:54.960 --> 02:02.320]  hospital right now he will be joining us coming up in the fourth hour today Ted
[02:02.320 --> 02:06.720]  Gunderson joining us in the fourth hour today he also was involved in Co and
[02:06.720 --> 02:12.480]  telepros and give you some window view into a bird's-eye view into that so Ted
[02:12.480 --> 02:17.640]  Gunderson former high-level retired FBI agent who woke up when he found out that
[02:17.640 --> 02:21.440]  basically there's a satanic grip of pedophiles running our country in the
[02:21.440 --> 02:25.560]  world of course he got laughed at by many people 20 years ago but documented
[02:25.560 --> 02:30.200]  much of what he covered and now a lot of what he covered decades ago is
[02:30.200 --> 02:36.520]  mainstream news so Ted Gunderson coming up in the last hour today you
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.400]  certainly want to join us for that I have a whole bunch of important stacks
[02:42.400 --> 02:48.760]  of news here in front of me threat of new larger Icelandic eruption looms
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.760]  there's a lot of top volcanologists saying with all this increase in
[02:52.760 --> 02:59.600]  volcanic and seismic earthquakes tsunamis around the world that there is
[02:59.600 --> 03:04.560]  an increasing chance though it's a low chance but an increasing chance that
[03:04.560 --> 03:10.960]  there could be an eruption in and around the supervolcano around Montana
[03:10.960 --> 03:18.600]  Wyoming Colorado you know that whole area that would be extremely devastating
[03:18.600 --> 03:22.800]  and I meant to get to this a few days ago but I will cover it later in the
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.400]  broadcast like later in the shower of course it centers in and around Yellow
[03:26.400 --> 03:34.840]  Stone Park but threat of new larger Icelandic eruption looms scientists are
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.240]  saying you could go for a month more you go for six months it could it could
[03:38.240 --> 03:44.640]  erupt for two years you see the earth is always changing the only thing that is
[03:44.640 --> 03:50.320]  constant is change that's why it's so asinine when Al Gore says pay me a carbon
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.560]  tax and I will save you from the rising sea levels it is a ridiculous joke the
[03:55.560 --> 04:00.920]  sea levels are not rising the earth is actually cooling and if this eruption
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.000]  continues it may make the earth two or three degrees scientists are saying
[04:05.000 --> 04:13.800]  colder in the next two years so generally volcanoes of this type that
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.960]  eject ash into the upper atmosphere cool the earth scientists have shown that the
[04:19.960 --> 04:25.480]  giant meteor that caused the extinction of many of the dinosaurs that hit a
[04:25.480 --> 04:31.600]  round the Yucatan potential the Yucatan Peninsula where the Gulf of Mexico
[04:31.600 --> 04:38.560]  enters into the Caribbean that that ejected so much particulate into the
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.360]  atmosphere that it caused as much as a 30 degree on average temperature
[04:43.360 --> 04:47.600]  reduction triggering an ice age basically that wiped them out the cold
[04:47.600 --> 04:55.520]  blooded dinosaurs okay GOP seeks SEC records on Goldman and Obama this is

[09:27.960 --> 09:32.800]  coming up the threat of a new larger Icelandic eruption looms that's out of
[09:32.800 --> 09:37.520]  the AP and this dovetails with a AFP agency French Press report rare
[09:37.520 --> 09:45.120]  Yellowstone volcano eruption would be deadly so I do want to get into some of
[09:45.120 --> 09:55.600]  that today separately GOP seeks SEC records on Goldman Sachs
[09:55.600 --> 09:59.800]  Representative Darrell Issa the top Republican on the House oversight
[09:59.800 --> 10:02.360]  committee is demanding a slew of documents from the Securities and
[10:02.360 --> 10:05.600]  Exchange Commission asserting that the timing of civil charges against Goldman
[10:05.600 --> 10:08.960]  Sachs raises serious questions about the Commission's independence and
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.000]  impartiality right up before the election it's a civil matter so it allows
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.080]  them to suck up all the evidence and cover it up the SEC's but intimately
[10:17.080 --> 10:19.640]  involved in the cover up they're demanding all the emails from the
[10:19.640 --> 10:24.840]  White House from the Treasury Secretary and others involved who were by the way
[10:24.840 --> 10:30.520]  all either financed by Goldman Sachs or former Goldman Sachs president CEOs
[10:30.520 --> 10:38.040]  vice presidents I mean there isn't a top slot whether it's Larry Summers whether
[10:38.040 --> 10:42.920]  it's Paulson whether it's Bernanke whether it's Tim Geithner it does I mean
[10:42.920 --> 10:49.720]  all of them all of them either headed it up or the deputy of the head and so
[10:49.720 --> 10:52.840]  they they sit in all the positions they sit in the Treasury they sit in all the
[10:52.840 --> 10:56.680]  Federal Reserve positions they sit in Goldman Sachs they sit in the SEC and
[10:56.680 --> 11:01.080]  this is how they get away with bloody murder it's like when Paulson we have
[11:01.080 --> 11:03.880]  this in the Obama deception was being grilled after he'd been secretary and
[11:03.880 --> 11:06.840]  every left and they said where did the hundreds of billions go and he says I
[11:06.840 --> 11:11.800]  won't tell you and Congress says well how did you give a bailout to your own
[11:11.800 --> 11:15.200]  company Goldman Sachs and you got $200 million at least in one payment
[11:15.200 --> 11:19.120]  yourself personally and he said oh I got a waiver and they said who gave you a
[11:19.120 --> 11:23.160]  waiver the Treasury Department gave me a waiver well who was the head of the
[11:23.160 --> 11:29.200]  Treasury Department well I was this would be like a bank manager giving
[11:29.200 --> 11:33.960]  himself a letter authorizing him to open the vault up at midnight and carry
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.400]  all the bags of cash out and put in the back of his truck it's illegal I mean
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.920]  you can't that's what's so dangerous about the White House lawyers under Bush
[11:43.920 --> 11:51.120]  and now under Obama saying the president is God he's the furor he it's it's not
[11:51.120 --> 11:54.720]  illegal when the president orders children tortured it's not illegal when
[11:54.720 --> 11:58.080]  the president orders the murders of individuals it's not illegal well yes
[11:58.080 --> 12:03.680]  it is I mean can the president have pygmies flown in from Africa and then
[12:03.680 --> 12:10.320]  marinate them and then cook them on a spit no could the president snort cocaine
[12:10.320 --> 12:16.200]  on the White House lawn no could Richard Nixon I mean he tried it at the time to
[12:16.200 --> 12:19.200]  say when the president vectors those famous tapes he says oh when the
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.560]  president does it though it's not illegal isn't that right he's sitting there
[12:23.560 --> 12:28.600]  talking to his top men in the Oval Office when I do it it's not illegal when I
[12:28.600 --> 12:36.880]  do it it's okay I'm not a crook I I'm not I I'm not a crook this is fundamental
[12:36.880 --> 12:40.920]  this is the fundamental lawlessness of government where they've just trained
[12:40.920 --> 12:44.320]  their minions to accept lying at every level and then the liars feel like
[12:44.320 --> 12:49.600]  they're insiders they're they're part of the lie you know I've studied World
[12:49.600 --> 12:54.560]  War one World War two I've studied the French and Indian War I studied the
[12:54.560 --> 13:03.080]  Spanish Civil War but in 1937 3839 and I studied the dispatches from the time
[13:03.080 --> 13:06.000]  from both sides I was just reading the history book about death the other day
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.200]  and they even the lowest level officers on both the fascist and communist side
[13:12.200 --> 13:17.160]  in the Spanish Civil War it was all about deceit all about staging terror
[13:17.160 --> 13:22.160]  attacks all about blaming each other for massacres it's a culture of lying and
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.720]  that's why once you have the Pentagon that Eisenhower warned us about what
[13:26.720 --> 13:33.360]  in 61 I mean how many years ago was that 49 years ago that's why it's so
[13:33.360 --> 13:37.760]  dangerous to have militarized police and have a military surveillance system in
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.640]  America because they are trained in their culture to lie and to kill and to
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.000]  steal and that's one thing if you're getting overrun an attack by some other
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.440]  nation and dirty tricks are played and I'm not even rationalizing that because
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.720]  once you go down that road see where we are but but that's that's another thing
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.760]  all together you certainly don't turn that loose inside your nation but that's
[14:02.760 --> 14:06.760]  now happened and it's fundamental I know I say this a lot but we need to get this
[14:06.760 --> 14:17.000]  out to everybody it's fundamental that this isn't our government you know I
[14:17.000 --> 14:20.560]  get sent these emails I see daily news articles attacking me mainstream
[14:20.560 --> 14:23.600]  alternative it doesn't matter I mean there's so many of them and I don't even
[14:23.600 --> 14:28.240]  you know read them I just scan over them quickly and they attack from every
[14:28.240 --> 14:37.040]  front but their main attack is I hate America and I want to bring down
[14:37.040 --> 14:39.880]  America and so that's why I'm criticizing the government that's the
[14:39.880 --> 14:46.640]  common theme you know I'm here pointing out that we've been colonized by
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.840]  offshore banks that there is a hostile corporate takeover going on and we have
[14:50.840 --> 14:54.440]  all the banking documents all the club of Rome all the human documents all the
[14:54.440 --> 15:00.120]  ran corporation CFR public and private and declassified and stolen and leaked
[15:00.120 --> 15:04.200]  and we know that they hate America they want to bring it down they want to
[15:04.200 --> 15:07.440]  bankrupt the average person they want to get you deep in debt that's the big
[15:07.440 --> 15:12.960]  power structure but on the left they say you're anti-american you're trying
[15:12.960 --> 15:15.800]  to undermine the president and on the phony right they say the same thing
[15:15.800 --> 15:19.960]  you're trying to undermine America talking about the police state it's a
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.200]  joke I mean when Bush was in office I was called a hardcore communist and I'm a
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.920]  constitutionalist now that Obama's in I'm called an extreme right winger who's
[15:29.920 --> 15:33.840]  calling for violence and you as listeners know that's a lie that's a
[15:33.840 --> 15:39.960]  complete manufactured lie and the government and even mainstream newspaper
[15:39.960 --> 15:43.560]  repeats it says I work for the Vatican when I'm not even Catholic they say I
[15:43.560 --> 15:46.520]  work for Israel when I have no connection to Israel and I'm very
[15:46.520 --> 15:50.080]  critical of Israel I've made films critical of Israel they say I'm a
[15:50.080 --> 15:53.320]  Scientologist I've been critical of Scientology I don't know any
[15:53.320 --> 16:01.040]  Scientologist I'm not involved in it they say I mean the sky's the limit in
[16:01.040 --> 16:05.880]  fact it was put out that I was secretly an Al Qaeda sleeper cell and then I
[16:05.880 --> 16:12.080]  worked for Al Qaeda this goes back six years because I was saying 9-11 was an
[16:12.080 --> 16:18.640]  inside job and I've now seen classic Republican operatives like what Cliff
[16:18.640 --> 16:22.440]  Kincaid and others and it's not effective but I'm just pointing it out so
[16:22.440 --> 16:26.560]  you understand what they're doing saying I work for Lyndon LaRouche I've never
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.280]  interviewed Lyndon LaRouche I've been critical of Lyndon LaRouche his analysis
[16:31.280 --> 16:35.360]  of the British banking cartel is accurate but so is Carol Quigley I mean
[16:35.360 --> 16:38.720]  you know Georgetown professor who was one of their historians who was for it
[16:38.720 --> 16:43.280]  900 page book I mean but I don't agree with LaRouche's answer to things big
[16:43.280 --> 16:51.800]  government they say I'm a Russian agent that's a new one because on 888 it was in
[16:51.800 --> 16:57.800]  the British and German and Russian and Japanese news that the Georgians snuck
[16:57.800 --> 17:02.400]  attacked South Ossetia started shelling it went into the military bases killed
[17:02.400 --> 17:06.320]  the Russian peacekeepers and then we learned that Dick Cheney wanted to start
[17:06.320 --> 17:13.800]  World War 3 with the Russians and our news ran a giant hoax saying that Russia
[17:13.800 --> 17:21.200]  had attacked Georgia well Ron Paul's been on the show and stated the fact that
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.040]  NATO and Georgia attacked that Russian controlled area with dr. Bob Bowman on
[17:26.040 --> 17:30.040]  yesterday I mean that's just a fact that's like saying the Sun didn't come
[17:30.040 --> 17:39.160]  up this morning and they say no I'm making it up the preposterous lie that
[17:39.160 --> 17:45.840]  that US-backed Georgia attacks South Ossetia I mean within three or four days
[17:45.840 --> 17:51.480]  CNN had to reverse themselves I mean they put the leader of Georgia on CNN on
[17:51.480 --> 17:55.320]  Fox everywhere calling for a new world order you can pull those clips up if
[17:55.320 --> 18:00.080]  it's in Invisible Empire he's calling for a new world order a global government
[18:00.080 --> 18:05.320]  and he's on there saying Russia has attacked us Russia pushed him out and
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.000]  then pulled back out of the country does that mean Russia's good absolutely not
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.120]  we wrote two articles yesterday and posted a video about clear evidence of
[18:14.120 --> 18:19.600]  Russia in the late 90s staging terror attacks but I mean it's asinine you know
[18:19.600 --> 18:30.280]  they say oh I must work for Iran and see this is how it works they attacked
[18:30.280 --> 18:35.240]  someone who's trying to get you to look at the facts for yourself to divert and
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.480]  distract attention away from the real culprits we have a global private
[18:39.480 --> 18:44.680]  banking cartel that's got its agents and its its tentacles into every nation
[18:44.680 --> 18:49.040]  it's openly announcing a world government again today I'm gonna get into
[18:49.040 --> 18:53.360]  that when we come back from break and I'm here simply pointing out what's
[18:53.360 --> 18:59.360]  happening and saying Goldman Sachs is criminal and needs to be indicted and
[18:59.360 --> 19:04.360]  you've got government hacks and people tied into the defense establishment who
[19:04.360 --> 19:09.320]  are not defending our republic they're doing everything they can to push this
[19:09.320 --> 19:13.600]  new world order to push the torture to push the secret arrest to push the
[19:13.600 --> 19:17.720]  Patriot Act that I told you eight years ago was for the American people because
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.720]  I read the bill now it's in the news yes Homeland Security the Patriot Act is
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.460]  for you you the American people are the main threat and the Tea Parties are
[19:25.460 --> 19:28.880]  supposedly terrorist and there's more news today saying we're terrorists and
[19:28.880 --> 19:33.800]  that internet blogging is a lot like terrorism and sedition and we've got to
[19:33.800 --> 19:38.360]  be shut down and you see Republican hacks and Democrat hacks they're really
[19:38.360 --> 19:42.240]  revealing themselves right now because they're in so much trouble going after

[24:11.400 --> 24:15.240]  anybody that criticizes the new world order the banking dictatorship is now
[24:15.240 --> 24:21.920]  out in the open GOP seeks SEC records on Goldman Sachs they want White House
[24:21.920 --> 24:27.840]  they want SEC emails they want the emails between the Federal Reserve and
[24:27.840 --> 24:34.320]  the White House and the SEC that's representative Darrell is now doing it
[24:34.320 --> 24:40.040]  continues is his letter addressed to SEC chairwoman Mary Shapiro and signed by
[24:40.040 --> 24:43.160]  eight other House Republicans asked whether the Commission had any contact
[24:43.160 --> 24:47.800]  about the case prior to its public release with White House aides well I mean
[24:47.800 --> 24:52.080]  we know they did with Geithner and that's illegal telling him not to release
[24:52.080 --> 24:56.160]  the bailout information Democratic Party Committee officials or members of
[24:56.160 --> 24:59.880]  Congress or their staff we are concerned that politics of unduly influence the
[24:59.880 --> 25:03.440]  decision and timing of the Commission's controversial enforcement action against
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.440]  Goldman is a rights is implied that the timing was a bit too convenient saying
[25:07.440 --> 25:11.000]  President Obama's push on Wall Street reform neatly coincided with the
[25:11.000 --> 25:16.840]  Commission's announcement of the suit now continuing here it of course has come
[25:16.840 --> 25:21.000]  out that a million dollars was given to the Obama campaign by Goldman Sachs
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.960]  they were his biggest contributor and then separately let me go back here
[25:26.960 --> 25:30.880]  before I get into this new headline of the London Guardian new global fat tax
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.760]  to rein in banks it's called the FAT Gordon Brown claims credit for
[25:35.760 --> 25:39.360]  International Monetary Fund plan to impose tough levy on biggest banks
[25:39.360 --> 25:45.000]  profits and pay well he does deserve the credit he's leading the G20 and he said
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.680]  it Copenhagen it doesn't matter if the countries didn't ratify this we will
[25:48.680 --> 25:54.680]  have Europe England Australia New Zealand the United States and Canada levy
[25:54.680 --> 25:58.520]  taxes in the name of banking reform you notice they have this international
[25:58.520 --> 26:04.400]  announcement as Obama is trying to pass the re-regulation that is really
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.080]  deregulation right at the same time it all couples together you have unified
[26:09.080 --> 26:14.440]  legislation at the international and national level and he said we will just
[26:14.440 --> 26:18.480]  levy the money pay it in the IMF and World Bank themselves holding companies
[26:18.480 --> 26:24.320]  for the biggest central banks so they will take tax money from all financial
[26:24.320 --> 26:27.920]  institutions see the headline says biggest banks then you read it says all
[26:27.920 --> 26:35.160]  financial institutions that's a check cashing place that's credit unions that's
[26:35.160 --> 26:39.520]  anybody who does lending that's that's dental offices that you know have credit
[26:39.520 --> 26:45.560]  lines that people can sign up for that's GMAC that's everything and so this sets
[26:45.560 --> 26:49.280]  up the international framework and just like they push the Federal Reserve in
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.320]  the banking takeover in the US their beachhead in 1913 as anti-big bank as
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.520]  a way to get the rich guys it's been released since then that they engineered
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.880]  the whole thing and acted like they were against it the big central banks wrote
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.960]  this this is their plan for the new Constitution of the world signed by the
[27:10.960 --> 27:14.360]  central bank heads that he's been announcing the last few months on
[27:14.360 --> 27:21.120]  television but it's being sold as if oh Obama and Gordon Brown in the EU they're
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.240]  getting tough on the bankers who meanwhile at Davos and Bilderberg and
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.720]  everywhere else for years they have been planning and pushing and even
[27:30.720 --> 27:35.400]  publicly promoting and they call it the new world order global government of
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.400]  foreign by the banks what's that Rockefeller quote about a world government
[27:39.400 --> 27:45.760]  for the administrative convenience of central bankers that's a quote now listen
[27:45.760 --> 27:48.840]  to this other one and guardian tough proposals to cut the world's biggest
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.960]  banks down to size by taxing their profits and pay or outline the
[27:53.960 --> 27:57.440]  international monetary fund tonight which is a big holding company for the
[27:57.440 --> 28:02.480]  banks in an attempt to spare taxpayers another massive public bailout of the
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.560]  financial sector oh they're gonna spare you though this is paid in tax money
[28:07.560 --> 28:12.400]  into the IMF and World Bank this is going to be matched and they they they
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.880]  take the money from the banks and put it in a pool which then the only select
[28:16.880 --> 28:20.480]  groups get to use in measures more stringent than Wall Street and the
[28:20.480 --> 28:26.960]  city had expected the city of London the fund called for both an instruction an
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.520]  introduction of a twin-track approach to the three-year banking crisis that would
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.920]  both force firms to pay for any future support packages and raise new taxes on
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.960]  their profits when remuneration the report prepared by the
[28:40.960 --> 28:45.080]  Washington based institution for the G20 group of developing developing
[28:45.080 --> 28:49.640]  nations was seized upon by Gordon Brown as evidence his push for an
[28:49.640 --> 28:54.640]  international crackdown on the banking sector was gaining support then in my
[28:54.640 --> 29:01.560]  next article here out of the AP it gets into the supposed bank
[29:01.560 --> 29:07.960]  re-regulation system here saying taxes on all financial institutions and it's
[29:07.960 --> 29:15.680]  the same thing being pushed by the G20 leaked in advance of the funds meeting
[29:15.680 --> 29:19.040]  this weekend the blueprint emerged as an investment bank Goldman Sachs released
[29:19.040 --> 29:23.200]  better than expected first quarter revenues and admitted its bonus and
[29:23.200 --> 29:29.440]  paid pool had reached 5.5 billion in the first three months of 2010 the
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.840]  anticipated study called for financial stability contribution which would be
[29:33.840 --> 29:39.760]  paid by all financial institutions not just banks and used to bail out weak
[29:39.760 --> 29:43.400]  and failing institutions that's not true we're gonna come back to that when we
[29:43.400 --> 29:47.160]  get back it is a tax on all institutions but it's not the weak ones

[33:54.320 --> 34:01.120]  evidence this is going to take the burden off of taxpayers it says
[34:01.120 --> 34:05.000]  International Monetary Fund tonight in an attempt to spare taxpayers and other
[34:05.000 --> 34:10.480]  massive public bailout of the financial sector this is the IMF and World Bank who
[34:10.480 --> 34:13.880]  were hated all over the third world they're known for coming in with say a
[34:13.880 --> 34:18.840]  billion dollar loan in Nigeria and even after 50 billion has been paid back over
[34:18.840 --> 34:23.240]  the last 30 years they still owe another 50 billion so so you pay over a hundred
[34:23.240 --> 34:28.360]  billion dollars back for one billion that's worse than loan sharking and it's
[34:28.360 --> 34:35.160]  made up money backed up by US and European taxpayers these are the
[34:35.160 --> 34:40.360]  international robbery arms of the banksters and so this article talks
[34:40.360 --> 34:43.320]  about Gordon Brown claims credit for International Monetary Fund plan to
[34:43.320 --> 34:48.640]  impose tough levy oh it's tough on the biggest banks profits and pay then you
[34:48.640 --> 34:53.520]  read down here at the bottom and they've got a link to the leaked G20 document
[34:53.520 --> 34:58.920]  and it says the anticipated study called for a financial stability
[34:58.920 --> 35:08.480]  contribution or FSC which would be paid by all financial institutions all and
[35:08.480 --> 35:16.600]  the article goes on not just banks and used to bail out weak and failing firms
[35:16.600 --> 35:22.920]  oh wait a minute we were told that the blank check to the bankers in October of
[35:22.920 --> 35:28.520]  2008 was to unfreeze mortgages to get the economy going and then the next day
[35:28.520 --> 35:32.360]  October 4th on that Saturday Paulson said we're not gonna spend it on that
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.000]  now and I won't tell you where the money went thank you for the blank check and
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.720]  having it in the law that there's no oversight thank you I'm the former head
[35:41.720 --> 35:46.680]  of Goldman Sachs I own you haha and now they're moving to the international
[35:46.680 --> 35:51.840]  level and simultaneously they have every major nation they control and the EU
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.800]  passing laws right now national laws to pay into this international level of the
[35:57.800 --> 36:02.440]  banks and the banks are signing a global treaty amongst themselves saying
[36:02.440 --> 36:08.240]  that's the world government these are Ponzi scheme operators that bought the
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.320]  world many times over out of nothing because they wore fancy suits and they
[36:12.320 --> 36:15.560]  paid off the politicians and they brainwashed the police and military to
[36:15.560 --> 36:20.680]  serve them and they fund the communists they fund the fascists they every
[36:20.680 --> 36:25.440]  chance they get England and the people that run the US they fund dictatorships
[36:25.440 --> 36:29.000]  worldwide and that's what they want here and that's what they're setting up here
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.560]  a dictatorship of these plutocrats oh puppets come and go but the
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.520]  dictatorship of the continuity of government emergency dictatorship system
[36:38.520 --> 36:46.840]  is in place and so the sky's the limit VAT taxes carbon taxes all of it to be
[36:46.840 --> 36:50.760]  paid to the federal government and then paid into the private banks as a tax
[36:50.760 --> 36:56.240]  then they say oh all financial institutions from check cashing places
[36:56.240 --> 37:02.840]  to small outfits that give loans to private car dealerships that give their
[37:02.840 --> 37:09.280]  own loans to mom and pop neighborhood community rural banks credit unions
[37:09.280 --> 37:16.400]  university credit unions union credit unions pension fund credit unions and
[37:16.400 --> 37:19.280]  they've announced they're ordering the private and public pension funds
[37:19.280 --> 37:22.680]  ordering them because they're the regulators that they can always find
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.080]  something you did wrong they're gonna audit and shut down these companies and
[37:26.080 --> 37:31.400]  their CEOs if they don't pay all of your money quote into failed banks they put
[37:31.400 --> 37:34.600]  it in the failed bank the IMF World Bank Federal Reserve one of those arms
[37:34.600 --> 37:39.040]  absorbs it absorbs the money and then goes back and gets another bailout for
[37:39.040 --> 37:43.280]  the bank they've taken over and the regulators can then go in and force the
[37:43.280 --> 37:47.000]  takeover of regional banks regional credit unions and they can raise the
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.840]  taxes to whatever they want and they want taxes on your fuel of federal tax
[37:50.840 --> 37:54.920]  and VAT on every step of the way of manufacturing and production in the
[37:54.920 --> 38:03.600]  country it says it would initially be paid at a flat rate but eventually be
[38:03.600 --> 38:09.440]  tailored to suit institution size and riskiness oh it's selectively enforced
[38:09.440 --> 38:15.240]  the G20 gets all the central bank heads to sign an agreement with each other
[38:15.240 --> 38:19.360]  that they can selectively do whatever they want boy isn't that the definition
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.920]  of tyranny and no one's talking about this no one even gets it I'm hearing
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.880]  almost no one but maybe Ron Paul and then he knows he's talking to a dumb
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.640]  down general audience on national TV doesn't get into any detail I mean we
[38:36.640 --> 38:42.520]  saw replay of this in February of last year with a stimulus package bailout
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.320]  ripoff number two and I've gone over this it's covered the Obama deception and
[38:47.320 --> 38:50.920]  that's why it's so important you see it it's just five minutes of the two-hour
[38:50.920 --> 38:57.120]  film and we show senator Dodd same guy on the banking committee right now
[38:57.120 --> 39:00.280]  pushing this new takeover through this is this is the big and that this dwarfs
[39:00.280 --> 39:04.720]  all the others it isn't the 50 billion he's talking about that's just the first
[39:04.720 --> 39:12.360]  payment it's the regulatory taxing system run by the private banks but pushed
[39:12.360 --> 39:16.040]  in the name of getting the rich guy getting those bankers that have screwed
[39:16.040 --> 39:19.680]  us getting those bankers that have been us over a barrel boy we're gonna show
[39:19.680 --> 39:28.520]  them can you believe it think I mean that's why they're in charge they know
[39:28.520 --> 39:31.880]  how to manipulate just like they said oh please don't pass the fellow reserve
[39:31.880 --> 39:35.400]  act please don't pass it please don't get us please don't shut us down please
[39:35.400 --> 39:38.200]  don't stop the robber barons we're against it meanwhile they wrote the
[39:38.200 --> 39:43.320]  whole thing had the meetings financed it boom gave you the income tax and they
[39:43.320 --> 39:46.800]  got rid of senators being controlled by the states the same year that was the
[39:46.800 --> 39:52.240]  big coup d'etat and we're 97 years into this dictatorship and it's getting
[39:52.240 --> 39:57.280]  worse and worse and worse because once these things go downhill more happens
[39:57.280 --> 40:04.960]  in five years than happened in the previous 97 and the sky's the limit so
[40:04.960 --> 40:07.720]  let me try to simply put this now I mean not that you don't understand as a
[40:07.720 --> 40:10.400]  general listener you probably know more than I do many of you but when you're
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.480]  talking to your friends and family this isn't a banking reform in a good way
[40:14.480 --> 40:19.680]  this is our federal government lining up to put taxes on all financial
[40:19.680 --> 40:25.240]  institutions and it's selective to where they can have the federal regulators
[40:25.240 --> 40:30.360]  that are former JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs alumni and CIA many of them it's
[40:30.360 --> 40:34.720]  come out go in and decide what banks and credit unions and community
[40:34.720 --> 40:39.520]  institutions and state banks the state bank movement they want to head off
[40:39.520 --> 40:42.720]  because that's starting to gain some traction they can come in and shut down
[40:42.720 --> 40:46.480]  whoever they want and I have noticed by the way it's the regional banks and the
[40:46.480 --> 40:50.240]  state banks and the local banks that are screaming bloody murder but they're just
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.400]  saying this is unfair trade advantage by the big banks that control the
[40:54.400 --> 40:59.360]  regulators we don't want this we're healthy we didn't get invested in
[40:59.360 --> 41:04.480]  derivatives we don't want to be part of this they're the real banks not the
[41:04.480 --> 41:12.040]  made-off can lay type scam systems that run the planet and so we better get the
[41:12.040 --> 41:15.480]  word out this is the biggest move towards world government we have ever
[41:15.480 --> 41:18.640]  seen I've been screaming bloody murders since November when we got the secret
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.400]  Copenhagen documents and then when it failed Gordon Brown and Obama came out
[41:22.400 --> 41:28.240]  and said okay it's world government we need it we need it right now to save the
[41:28.240 --> 41:32.360]  planet and punish the banks we need a constitution of the banks and we need to
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.320]  have all this tax money paid into the coffers of the banks oh that will
[41:35.320 --> 41:43.600]  certainly show them again tailored to suit institution size and riskiness
[41:43.600 --> 41:51.120]  they will decide at an international level who pays taxes now let's go back
[41:51.120 --> 41:55.640]  to February of last year and the stimulus package oh we've got to save
[41:55.640 --> 41:59.440]  the car makers we've got to give them stimulus money so they can move to
[41:59.440 --> 42:05.000]  Brazil and Russia and Eastern Europe and China which is what they've used most
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.880]  of stimulus money for you give them 30 something billion to General Motors they
[42:08.880 --> 42:15.800]  use it to move offshore that's the globalist model the GMAC its banking
[42:15.800 --> 42:21.240]  business is much better than its car manufacturing it's all funny money they
[42:21.240 --> 42:28.080]  could buy the world every day if they can get you to buy into it you'll kill
[42:28.080 --> 42:32.160]  for a dollar you'll you'll kill for an iPad some of you out there you know
[42:32.160 --> 42:38.760]  money's what we worship and it's all made up by these Ponzi scheme gods so
[42:38.760 --> 42:45.160]  remember Dodd they came out Obama Dodd said this is gonna punish CEOs this is
[42:45.160 --> 42:50.320]  gonna cap their pay this is gonna cap bonuses this is gonna stop all this no
[42:50.320 --> 42:54.000]  discussion about the shareholders the CEOs are just frontmen yeah some CEO
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.680]  gets a hundred million bucks or something that's nothing compared to the
[42:56.680 --> 43:00.800]  tens of billions and trillions of the shareholders the big families are getting
[43:00.800 --> 43:04.640]  so that's a red herring within a red herring wheels within wheels shills
[43:04.640 --> 43:11.880]  within shills scams within scams frauds within frauds and we've got clips of
[43:11.880 --> 43:15.720]  Obama in the films Obama deception over and over again we're gonna get tough and
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.560]  it's wrong that the banks have done this meanwhile they totally financed him and
[43:18.560 --> 43:21.680]  put him in office and he's whole White House is more banker run than anybody in
[43:21.680 --> 43:28.560]  history the maximum puppet and then it comes out people actually read the bill
[43:28.560 --> 43:34.280]  the day before they pass it and they went ahead and passed it and suddenly a
[43:34.280 --> 43:39.120]  few newspapers report well wait a minute this says retroactively after the
[43:39.120 --> 43:43.920]  banking bailout legislation because it wasn't just a bailout it was legislation
[43:43.920 --> 43:49.120]  to give them more control this allows in perpetuity all the big banks to continue
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.520]  what they've done under the old deal into the future with no sunset and it's on
[43:54.520 --> 44:00.040]  the honor system and is selectively enforced and the White House said
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.120]  that's senator Dodd how dare you senator Dodd and Dodd came out and released
[44:03.120 --> 44:08.320]  emails surprised I didn't blow his airplane up and he said I did what the
[44:08.320 --> 44:14.960]  White House told me to here's your emails remember that that's how cynical
[44:14.960 --> 44:21.280]  and sickening this is so I'm spending a lot of time on this today because it's
[44:21.280 --> 44:25.440]  here and it's being billed in the AP and the London Guardian the Wall Street
[44:25.440 --> 44:29.360]  Journal the New York Times all the banks don't like it
[44:29.360 --> 44:36.320]  oh man Obama is getting tough on them whoo he is gonna put a big tax on him and
[44:36.320 --> 44:40.760]  then you read the legislation it's selectively enforced the regulators are
[44:40.760 --> 44:43.560]  controlled by the top banks it allows them to come in and shut down their
[44:43.560 --> 44:49.320]  competition and it mirrors the G20 plan that the US is the main driver and
[44:49.320 --> 44:55.320]  signatory to along with England and then you find out it's a tax on all
[44:55.320 --> 45:03.880]  financial institutions passed on to you and then they take that money and pay it
[45:03.880 --> 45:11.160]  into a federal slash IMF World Bank kitty and then the revolving door between
[45:11.160 --> 45:17.320]  the top eight banks or so globally the revolving door in the IMF and World Bank
[45:17.320 --> 45:21.920]  all the former bank heads of Europe and the US that revolving door on the IMF
[45:21.920 --> 45:26.880]  and World Bank they will decide quote who to bail out that means oh here's a
[45:26.880 --> 45:34.920]  trillion bucks Goldman Sachs you can keep it think about the magnitude of
[45:34.920 --> 45:38.720]  this and its problem reaction solution they create the original financial
[45:38.720 --> 45:44.000]  crisis they get tens of trillions of dollars they freeze the economy they
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.320]  refuse to lend they cut their lending when they promised the bailout was to
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.520]  expand lending then they come in and say we've got a plan to fix things the
[45:51.520 --> 45:58.040]  banks don't like it when they wrote it but we're gonna do it and it allows us
[45:58.040 --> 46:01.760]  to selectively tailor and do whatever we want and it's all gonna be secretive
[46:01.760 --> 46:07.840]  just like the past bailouts so just sit down and shut up and enjoy it but now
[46:07.840 --> 46:11.120]  your money is going to go directly to the international level when they're
[46:11.120 --> 46:15.000]  just bypassing even the UN being the world government just directly to the
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.640]  bankers and they're also in the news saying we need this to fund the third
[46:19.640 --> 46:23.400]  world to stop starvation and then you actually read the Copenhagen document
[46:23.400 --> 46:27.520]  that that's what the third world pulled out it right at doubles the taxes
[46:27.520 --> 46:31.360]  greenhouse gas taxes on them than it does the West it's designed to destroy
[46:31.360 --> 46:35.200]  their industrial development to freeze their development to keep them as
[46:35.200 --> 46:43.440]  shadow bankrupt stone-age societies that can just be looted and controlled deep
[46:43.440 --> 46:53.160]  oppressive poverty as a tool of domination it's totally sick and then the
[46:53.160 --> 46:56.720]  globalists have the nerve to attack those of us that understand what the
[46:56.720 --> 46:59.640]  banks are doing the end the Feders and others and say you're terrorist you're
[46:59.640 --> 47:04.000]  racist or you're an American oh you don't like the banking oligarchs running
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.680]  your country you're bad you want to bring America down when America is
[47:09.680 --> 47:13.000]  already long gone we might be able to get it back but let's just admit we've
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.360]  been taken over and now they're not going to stop they're going to keep
[47:16.360 --> 47:20.080]  hammering and hammering and hammering the good news is the criminality is
[47:20.080 --> 47:23.200]  coming out but the Republican leadership isn't going after Goldman Sachs
[47:23.200 --> 47:25.960]  because they contribute to them as well they're not going after the real
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.200]  corruption they're just using this to score political points to get back in
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.240]  for themselves in fact here's the next line
[47:36.640 --> 47:42.080]  while the banks had been bracing for the FSC plan they were caught unaware oh
[47:42.080 --> 47:47.040]  they didn't know that they haven't been having all these big g20 meetings and the
[47:47.040 --> 47:50.280]  secret meeting a month and a half ago that was the headline in Australia heads
[47:50.280 --> 47:56.240]  of 27 biggest banks meeting secret with IMF World Bank in Australia oh they
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.360]  were unaware oh they don't want it see they know they've got about a 1%
[48:00.360 --> 48:06.600]  approval rating literally and so they're like oh no we don't like this in the
[48:06.600 --> 48:10.880]  public's like you're gonna get you where for it glad Obama's finally doing
[48:10.880 --> 48:17.000]  something while banks had been bracing for the FSC plan they were bracing
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.360]  bracing for their world government throne they were so upset by winning the
[48:21.360 --> 48:26.760]  lottery they were bracing they were bracing for their their vacation with
[48:26.760 --> 48:31.240]  the Swedish bikini team it was just so horrible they were just so afraid of it
[48:31.240 --> 48:35.440]  they were so afraid of the pot of gold that that the leprechaun was giving them
[48:35.440 --> 48:42.120]  it was terrible while banks have been bracing for the FSC plan that they wrote
[48:42.120 --> 48:46.560]  I would add they were caught unaware oh by the proposal for a financial
[48:46.560 --> 48:50.760]  activities tax see then they go even further it's a financial activities tax
[48:50.760 --> 48:55.640]  it's a tax on you it's a value-added tax the way I read that we have the
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.240]  document right here the way we really it's a tax not just on all the seats
[49:00.240 --> 49:06.200]  always worse than even I'm saying here it's everything it's cashing your check
[49:06.200 --> 49:11.360]  it's electronic transfer it's credit card bills it's a tax on everything on
[49:11.360 --> 49:16.240]  every step of the process while banks have been bracing for the FSC plan they
[49:16.240 --> 49:19.680]  were caught unaware by the proposal for a financial activities tax which will be
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.240]  based on the profits and the pay structure of the firms and would be on
[49:24.240 --> 49:29.120]  all financial institutions and transactions but then next next they
[49:29.120 --> 49:33.600]  say it's liberal and loving see here here they go anti-poverty campaigners had
[49:33.600 --> 49:39.720]  been pinning their hopes oh oh on the IMF endorsing a so-called Robin Hood tax
[49:39.720 --> 49:44.920]  under the small levy would be placed on all financial transactions however the
[49:44.920 --> 49:49.120]  funds said such an approach does not appear to be well suited for specific
[49:49.120 --> 49:52.200]  purposes but I've read it it just allows them to do it's a blank check it says
[49:52.200 --> 49:58.200]  they have the tutorial power in the end of story set out by the G20 and its
[49:58.200 --> 50:02.200]  mandate the funds said the financial sector had become too big as a result of
[50:02.200 --> 50:06.680]  being taxed too lightly and said this could be addressed by the FAT which is
[50:06.680 --> 50:14.200]  compared to a VAT see VAT the FAT is a tax on every level of any financial
[50:14.200 --> 50:18.240]  transaction and as a control grid surveilling all of that and that's why
[50:18.240 --> 50:22.160]  you're gonna have a national ID card that you've got a swipe this is in the
[50:22.160 --> 50:26.280]  white papers going back over 10 years to track everything you do because they
[50:26.280 --> 50:29.920]  they're gonna make any type of black market mowing your neighbors Leon
[50:29.920 --> 50:35.640]  selling couch for the TV any type of barter is gonna be illegal that's what
[50:35.640 --> 50:39.080]  they're passing laws trying to ban and restrict a million dollar fines for
[50:39.080 --> 50:45.560]  garage sales or swap meets it's all here I I just can't even believe it myself
[50:45.560 --> 50:49.080]  it's so monstrous enjoy all the new taxes but see these will just be like

[50:52.880 --> 50:57.240]  different little fees those are just taxes they pass on your cell phone that

[51:13.640 --> 51:17.080]  perform even golden silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[51:17.080 --> 51:20.880]  even happen again so our friends and solutions from science have put together

[54:02.340 --> 54:09.280]  so let's be clear the G20 met in November and December and publicly said
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.760]  they were establishing global governance of foreign by the banks but it was in
[54:13.760 --> 54:17.640]  the back of the newspaper and you had to watch Davos meetings and others we got
[54:17.640 --> 54:22.080]  the clips we put them in fall the Republic we put them in invisible Empire
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.640]  we warned people we told you the exact plan because we were reading their
[54:26.640 --> 54:33.000]  blueprint and now they're going to have a global regime of VAT value added on
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.080]  every financial traction interaction that everyone makes and you read the
[54:37.080 --> 54:41.840]  documents here it says it's broad and wide open for interpretation by the
[54:41.840 --> 54:46.960]  regulators in fact here's a quote from Gordon Brown out of the London Guardian
[54:46.960 --> 54:52.160]  the fund added that cooperation required only broad agreement see it's
[54:52.160 --> 54:55.520]  wide open rather than complete uniformity they keep repeating that they
[54:55.520 --> 55:00.880]  can selectly do whatever they want and did not specify rates for the two new
[55:00.880 --> 55:06.600]  taxes a brown aid that's Gordon Brown said the report is radical and in line
[55:06.600 --> 55:14.720]  with what they had argued for at the G20 in November when Brown surprised his
[55:14.720 --> 55:20.120]  Treasury team by promoting the idea of international levies or international
[55:20.120 --> 55:26.240]  taxes it is another big judgment call that Gordon Brown got right and David
[55:26.240 --> 55:29.000]  Cameron got wrong that's who he's running against for Prime Minister right
[55:29.000 --> 55:34.880]  now the aid said Alistair Darling the Chancellor welcomed the report oh yes
[55:34.880 --> 55:39.480]  the Chancellor of the Exchequer of course the banker the recognition that
[55:39.480 --> 55:43.840]  banks should make a contribution to society is in which they operate is
[55:43.840 --> 55:48.640]  right make a contribution they are all run by these people the banks are the
[55:48.640 --> 55:53.040]  ones that are ramming this through and lobbying for it this is world government
[55:53.040 --> 56:02.440]  a tax and regulatory power over all of their smaller competition and it goes
[56:02.440 --> 56:06.440]  on Max Lawson policy advisor at Oxfam said the IMF has been given the green
[56:06.440 --> 56:11.800]  light to tax banks to be worthy of Robin Hood it must raise hundreds of
[56:11.800 --> 56:15.160]  millions each year and be directly linked to fighting poverty at home and
[56:15.160 --> 56:21.640]  abroad and tackling climate change there you go helping the poor and fighting
[56:21.640 --> 56:25.720]  climate change I mean shutting down industrial development as the parasite
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.760]  economy takes over the real economy I mean do you realize how huge this is
[56:30.760 --> 56:33.960]  I've got to get Watson or Steve Watson or Curtin and want to write an article
[56:33.960 --> 56:38.600]  about this based on the analysis I just laid out in the last 30 minutes because
[56:38.600 --> 56:42.680]  I just broke it all down for you because this is what they say they're doing in
[56:42.680 --> 56:45.680]  their internal documents and then publicly they say it's about helping the
[56:45.680 --> 56:48.760]  poor and then you get the documents and it says it's meant to shut down
[56:48.760 --> 56:53.760]  industrial society in the West in the first world in Japan and in the third
[56:53.760 --> 57:00.840]  and developing world period end of story oh and anybody who criticizes them as a
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.360]  racist and as a hate monger and as a terrorist and that's coming up when we

[57:18.280 --> 57:24.840]  this to save the earth from rising sea levels or we're basically all going to
[57:24.840 --> 57:31.380]  drowned coming up cops link white supremacist to bombs in

[58:10.200 --> 58:15.520]  them unless they stage a terror attack and so the fact that this is starting to
[58:15.520 --> 58:19.240]  come out on more and more me limbaugh is talking about it last week is big

[01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.000]  transactions as a value-added tax on every step of a financial transaction to
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.760]  the private banks this is being billed as a way to counter the banks when they're
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.200]  actually pushing it through they will use this to go after all their
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.360]  competition this is very serious in gordon brown calls this world

[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:53.400]  uh... i'm a big fan of his work he has done what i think is his best video very
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:57.480]  eloquent and the text of it is up on info wars dot com
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.600]  and prison planet dot com it's titled when false flags don't fly
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.120]  and we're going to air this video and audio coming up at the thirty three
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:10.760]  after uh... or at the bottom of this hour
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.440]  because he just chronicles some of the more documented false flag terror
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.440]  tax staged by governments uh... around the world
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.720]  from the u.s israel russia the british uh... the list goes on and on very
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:27.240]  important video i think it's very informative eight minute video

[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.240]  up uh... in about uh... thirty minutes and twenty two seconds

[01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.680]  and right in line with that they've got every major nation like the united
[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:59.000]  states passing their own regulatory reform bill with the same pitch
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.200]  oh this is going to get the bankers this is going to punish him this is going to
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.800]  make them pay for the bailouts of the citizens in that great
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.880]  when it's a tax on all their competition paid to the mega banks that are
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.280]  engineering the formation of world government
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.800]  i can't say it any simpler and hardly anyone gets it or understands it
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:21.960]  we have got to stop it we have got to get the word out
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.760]  about this now and say no and and senator dodds bill

[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:42.040]  must be stopped now not next week not next year we have got to call
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.600]  congress and say we understand this is another scam
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.120]  but don't look for the republican leadership ron paul's against it but
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.280]  don't look for the republican leadership to speak out against this
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:56.760]  oh they're saying they're against it playing politics because it goes too far
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:00.440]  against the banks well yeah it goes too far giving the mega banks
[01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:05.400]  dictatorial power but some republicans are supporting
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.440]  this because they're being funded by goldman sacks jp morgan

[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.040]  money to main streets they can consolidate power
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.240]  as bad as that was that was only a forte
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.800]  and hors d'oeuvre a uh you know a glass of wine before the
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.480]  10 course meal and the meal is us we are the enemy

[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:17.080]  the biggest news in years on world government they're actually
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:21.160]  doing it we have the g20
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.120]  document that's been released for the one in guardian we have the
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.120]  the article in the ap and the guardian they are
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:32.680]  packaging it and pushing it as if it's a way to get back at the big banks to
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.240]  make them pay their own way to make them pay taxes
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:38.520]  when the big mega central banks wrote this and when you read it
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:44.280]  it allows them to levy taxes value added on all financial transactions
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:47.800]  not just banks on your check on what you cash
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.800]  on your stocks on your bonds on credit unions
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.160]  the big banks wrote this but just like in 1913
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.200]  they were able to take over our issuance of currency and credit from
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.160]  the congress which is illegal and unconstitutional
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.560]  they pushed that through as an anti-banking bill to punish the bankers
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:09.640]  the robber barons and here's gordon brown in november
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.520]  in december and in january it's all in the article saying
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.360]  this is global government this is world government this will punish the banks
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:21.480]  when the banks wrote this that's how they do it they use deception and in
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.280]  england and in europe and in the united states
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.800]  they are trying to pass quote banking reform bills
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.640]  that they admit in these articles and in the document plug into the
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.920]  international agreement the new bank of the world
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:40.200]  global governance is here
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.680]  we're going to be covering that more later meanwhile gop seeks sec records on
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.400]  goldman sacks between them and the white house
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:53.240]  so the plot is thickening on that front now
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:10:01.560]  i want to get into the latest developments dealing with the
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:07.160]  tea parties it's very elementary what's happening is
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.840]  the system is coming out and saying if you criticize the private banks if you
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:14.520]  criticize the private fellow reserve if you criticize the banker bailouts if
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.520]  you criticize that they won't tell congress
[01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.920]  where trillions of dollars went if you do that you're basically a terrorist
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.520]  and i don't have to tell you this is going on anybody who listens to radio
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.360]  anybody that reads the newspaper anybody who
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:33.240]  spends any time watching the news knows this is everywhere i mean i hardly
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.600]  watch any television every time i turn it on when i'm on the treadmill or late
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.800]  at night or the youtube videos i've sent by listeners
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:47.080]  it's just 24 seven saying that all the tea parties are racist
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:52.360]  the american people are evil what does racism have to do
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.080]  with not wanting to pay trillions to foreign banks
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.720]  what does racism have to do with not wanting the government to take over
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:01.080]  healthcare and cut benefits out of the american people when the insurance
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.120]  companies actually wrote the scam you've heard ron paul here on the show
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.520]  document that it's not just me saying that you heard lord
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.640]  montan last week agree anybody who's read the bill and i have
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.960]  that's what it does now
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:23.000]  these are just three video clips and audio clips from just the last two days
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:30.520]  here's one article cfr journalist calls tea party talks seditious illegal
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.360]  and uh... that's joe cline council on foreign relations member
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.720]  if you read the public by monthly book they put a book out
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.160]  on newsstands not a newspaper not a magazine it's a book it's a paperback
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:47.400]  book calling for world government and telling you how great it is
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.920]  he's saying it is seditious to criticize the government and we've got a clip of
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.400]  michael savage a new clip not not not the last two clips where he said
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.680]  obama will blow up a capital building or carry out a rise stag attack
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:02.680]  to set up martial law which i agree
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.360]  now he's talking about the tea parties where the democrats have been caught
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:09.720]  dressing up like nazis with swastika signs they've not been caught we told
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.000]  you this a month ago it's been mainstream news since last monday for over a
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.560]  week and a half they have been caught and they
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.920]  they did what they promised they went out to tea parties from new mexico
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:23.560]  to texas to origan to new york city to dc
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.000]  in nazi outfits with swastikas we've shown you those photos and videos
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.360]  the black congressional caucus has been caught going out trying to start fights
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.240]  no one's calling them inward no one's spitting on them
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.720]  this is another form of false flag but they're not going to stop there
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.400]  they are going to blow up some federal buildings they are going to engage in
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.200]  terror attacks guaranteed it's the only card they've got
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.640]  to blame it on us to try to shut down our political speech because we are
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.880]  telling the truth we are constitutionalist
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.200]  we're standing up to the law of the land and there's nothing these people can do
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.360]  to shut us up but stage events and blame them on us
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.160]  it is very very elementary and simple and coming up in about 20 minutes
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.000]  i'm going to play an excellent eight-minute analysis
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.400]  uh... when false flags don't fly by james corbett very powerful
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.800]  i mean this is this is five stars this is i give this guy a ninety nine
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:21.400]  okay and i don't think i'd ever get myself even a ninety nine
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.280]  uh... you know if you're grading a speech
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.320]  i don't know i guess that was about a hundred uh... that i did in front of the
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:30.680]  bilberberg group that time uh... in uh...
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.880]  in canada bullhorning the bilberberg but uh...
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.160]  it's as good as it gets very powerful very focused
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:41.000]  this is more of what we need to see very effective so that's
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.680]  that's coming up let's go ahead and play the short clip of cfr journalist
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:47.720]  calls tea party talk seditious on slime ball
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:51.560]  with chris slimansson uh... here it is
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:55.240]  just watch sarah palin and she said unamerican
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.480]  now she said it was just as policy is not him but those words are license words
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.080]  the commission world you know i did i did a little bit of research just before
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.640]  the show is on this little napkin here i looked at the definition of sedition
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:11.400]  which is conduct or language inciting rebellion
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.440]  against the authority of the state and a lot of these statements especially the
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.240]  ones coming from people like glenn beck and to a certain extent sarah palin
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.320]  we're right next right right up close to being seditious
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.440]  well this is and you know it shows right and i i'll they'll name another person
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.480]  you know name is bear you know who uses this phrase constantly talks about the
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.880]  obama administration as a regime that phrase which you which has connotations
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.480]  of tyranny and what's so interesting about it to me to get to nora's point
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.680]  what is the focus what's the cause of this you think back to 1994
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:45.960]  there was ruby ridge there was wake up there were triggering incidents there's
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.800]  been nothing like that okay and they go on and on
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:53.960]  uh... basically saying we're terrorists so if you say i don't want tyranny
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.080]  gun controls tyranny open borders is tyranny
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.320]  uh... federalization of local police is tyranny i mean by every yardstick
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.840]  they've had big universities do an analysis and find the u.s is the number
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.960]  six police state in the world i mean is mexico a tyranny
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.920]  is north korea a tyranny they're ahead of us
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:15.240]  north korea is number one we're number six folks and i don't want to move
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:18.600]  up towards number one this is not a uh...
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:25.640]  laurel or a prize you know it's kind of like they say on that uh... movie
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:30.680]  talladega nights if you know if you're not uh... first year last or what's the
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.880]  what's the corny thing they say in that movie
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.960]  you're not first year last yeah uh... well no this is something where we want
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:40.360]  to be last well we don't want to be first
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.960]  for this and it's both parties i mean
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.000]  republicans who are mainline republicans they should love obama
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.200]  continuing wars continuing secret arrest continuing torture
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.440]  hiring nothing but lobbyist uh... continuing you know all of this
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.640]  corruption continuing all the bushes executive orders continuing bushes
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.520]  cyber security takeover of the internet
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.960]  there is no difference with obama on real issues
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.040]  oh bush was supposedly anti-abortion kind of halfway
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.680]  he was for the assault weapons ban so there they are saying sedition
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:19.240]  now this is what michael savage again i rarely play their talk show host but
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.800]  when rush limbaugh says obama may stage events
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.720]  and michael savages saying it every week now i mean this is from monday
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.760]  uh... we've got to give credit where credit's due because these guys reach
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.040]  tens of millions of people and i don't like being alone
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:35.720]  i don't want to be the leader i don't want to be the one guy who's right
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.880]  i don't want to be the uh... one person who's got the courage to say this okay
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.160]  i believe me i like to walk point but i'd like to
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.760]  rotate with other people i like to be more targets out there i don't like to
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.560]  be the only person telling the truth here
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.080]  and so uh... here is michael savage talking about this on monday here this
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:56.040]  they want you to react don't you understand what uh... obama is doing with his
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.880]  little men you can turn it off now his little men on the left are trying to
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.600]  provoke you into a violent act so they can declare you the illegitimate ones
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.760]  don't take the bait they want the tea party to explode
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.520]  they have probably sent the gen provocateurs in there with guns
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.280]  i can guarantee you that this government is going to do something along those
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.480]  lines whether it's sooner or later it's going to happen and i'll make another
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.600]  prediction on this show right now because it doesn't take a genius to know
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.400]  what this illegitimate band of gangsters is going to do next
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.640]  i'll make it very clear for you this illegitimate group of gangsters is not
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:33.640]  only going to cause a violent action somewhere in america that is not
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:37.320]  conducted by the tea parties but by an ajan provocateur that they sent into
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.520]  the crowds along the lines of what the left is done for the beginning of
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:45.560]  the left okay but the october surprise that they have in mind for this world
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.680]  is not to be imagined because they know they're going to lose if they have a
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.120]  plated fair and square a number one they wouldn't be in power today that's to
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.040]  start with if they have a plated fair and square the illegal aliens never would
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.520]  have been and he goes on to say they're going to stage
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:02.440]  a Reichstag event now the whole video is up on info wars dot com and prison
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.760]  planet dot com why is this important
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.200]  well as soon as the republicans get back in they're going to start blowing stuff
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:11.640]  up okay i mean this is what governments do now
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.840]  and we've got a big dirty corrupt government who's desperate
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:19.080]  and who has what a 10 percent approval rating for congress now
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.920]  a nine percent for nancy polosi even lower than dick cheney
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:26.040]  when governments get in trouble and they're corrupt they start
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.920]  staging terror we're going to cover the history of that coming up at about 12
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:35.800]  minutes uh but uh here's another clip and we'll
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.800]  play this when we come back from break washington post writer
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.800]  internet journalism is sort of like terrorism
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.840]  and we're not even looking for these clips they're just everywhere
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.760]  so they're now equating criticizing the government and internet journalism
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:54.440]  with terror because the alternative media has now
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.440]  surpassed the mainstream media in 2010 that's mainline numbers
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.800]  that the studies also show people vastly
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.480]  trust the alternative media more than they trust the mainstream media
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.240]  which is actually kind of scary there's a lot of bs on the alternative media too
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:12.600]  i mean uh we try to get it right we get it wrong sometimes a lot of people out
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.880]  there just making stuff up but it it doesn't matter people know the
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.880]  mainstream media is organized and deceptive and they trust the alternative
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.680]  media a lot more and so they have this whole discussion
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:27.720]  about terrorism and not knowing how to target the alternative media
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.520]  so they're really getting desperate because the mainstream media is dying
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.960]  the government's in deep trouble falling apart they're circling the wagons
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.680]  together and saying they want to shut down freedom on the web
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.200]  and and have a rigged game because they're losing because they've been
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.920]  discredited because they've been caught lying millions of times i mean
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.840]  literally just constant lying like hundreds of millions of
[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:52.040]  parrots up on a tree squawking lies uh we'll be back uh with that
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:56.120]  and a lot more and they've had another fake raid out in california
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:01.240]  to create that that illusion that there are all these terrorists stay with us

[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:27.320]  is seditious is illegal borders on terrorism you've got clinton saying
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.440]  look if you don't stop criticizing the government it's going to cause someone
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.200]  to stage a terror attack and gee i hope that doesn't have to happen
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:39.240]  so we can then silence you i mean it's a very thinly veiled threat
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:42.840]  washington post columnist who appeared on cbs faced the nation on sunday
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:46.840]  described he partiers as potential violent and decried
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.720]  internet journalism as sort of like terrorism
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:56.840]  it's a bullet surprise winning um kathleen parker is a commentator with the
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.080]  show and you can watch the whole eight minute clip
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.160]  up on prisonplanet.com in our article washington post writer
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.640]  internet journalism is sort of like terrorism we're just going to play a
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.440]  short clip of this listen opinion that comes uh from various places like
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:14.040]  during uh lincoln's day every newspaper had an editorial
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:16.840]  point of view but this person said the difference was
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:20.600]  in those days you knew which paper it was coming from
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:24.440]  now you don't know where some of this is coming from and and that is
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.360]  the added factor to the volatility of this stuff
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:32.280]  yeah it's interesting people will say anything when they have the the cloak of
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.280]  anonymity it's sort of like terrorism you know we don't know where to aim
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:40.760]  our bomb so we can't go after a country because there are
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:45.160]  you know there's no one place to focus on and it's the same thing with
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.520]  with the internet you can't really you don't know who to go after and you and
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.240]  i i'm sure you share some of the the wonderful experiences i've had of
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.960]  being attacked and threatened and whatnot and it's
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:00.920]  uh it's sort of it feeds on itself you know builds and and people who are
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:05.560]  not well grounded and who may have these uh these more violent tendencies
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.920]  suddenly find a place where they can convene and find
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.320]  validation and even so there you have it anybody criticizing the government or
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:16.840]  who is angry you don't have a real reason to be angry or upset
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.960]  you're just not well grounded you've got a mental problem
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.160]  and you're like a terrorist you know these bloggers online are
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:27.800]  basically kind of like terrorists but uh the host of the show
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.640]  bob Schaefer uh you could hear part of the clip but before that he was talking
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:34.280]  about lincoln you know we had free speech under
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:38.600]  lincoln no he arrested hundreds of newspaper editors in the north
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:43.560]  who were against the war uh he even arrested a member of congress
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.760]  uh so i guess what he's saying is under lincoln we knew where they were that's
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.480]  kind of a veiled threat for those that know history
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.640]  and they keep modeling obama like he's the new lincoln
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.520]  they were saying this when he was running for office that the nation may fall
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.880]  apart but he'll hold it together and he's going to deal with the states
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.160]  they knew the states were going to rebel against all this unconstitutional
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.120]  activity and so they've been writing books about him as if he's the second
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.480]  coming of lincoln they've been preparing everyone that when obama has
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.920]  to crack down on the terrorist on the states rights people and the people
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.640]  that don't like the foreign banks taking over
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:19.640]  that are angry at wall street that he's going to be just like lincoln
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.800]  he is going to come in there and he is going to put his foot down
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:29.640]  in a big big way and uh he is going to save the republic and we'll have big
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:35.640]  marble statues to him thank god we've got barack h obama
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:38.760]  meanwhile he always talks about reconciliation everybody be friendly
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.880]  come on don't have bad rhetoric republicans you know conservatives
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.720]  libertarians shut up meanwhile all his surrogates are out on tv
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:48.680]  and in the newspapers and bill clinton's out there saying
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.080]  we're going to cause terrorism those of us that don't like them and are
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.560]  criticizing them we don't have a right as americans to
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.360]  criticize what they're doing we're going to cause violence we're we're
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:00.680]  racist because they don't want hispanics and black people
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.600]  who are angry about higher taxes and less jobs and unemployment and
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:08.200]  government corruption and the government tripling under bush and even
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:12.200]  growing faster under obama you know people are mad that's why the polls show
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.880]  over 40 of the tea partiers are democrats or independents
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.920]  oh they're scared of that the people getting together getting outside the
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.960]  left-right paradigm coming together to save the country
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.800]  so they're saying racism it's racism it's evil it's hate
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:29.640]  it's the Ku Klux Klan it's bad it's terrorism it's
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:33.880]  and then meanwhile they've had a bust in california when you read deeper into
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.120]  the ap and other articles there's no bombs no evidence of bombs
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.000]  they went and busted some white supremacist gangs that the prisons
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.800]  basically create there's either an hispanic gang
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.560]  black gang asian gang or white gang or you don't live
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:50.120]  and they segregate them in the prisons and jails like this
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.480]  in california so they've busted some white supremacist gangs
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.760]  and are saying they think it may lead to bombs they
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:01.640]  they think they may have bombs and they try to tie it into the tea party
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:04.280]  i mean what does gang violence in the prisons
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:07.560]  have to do with the tea party but again it's just like the hatari militia
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.520]  they didn't do anything they didn't have any weapons the feds have now put out
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.560]  their affidavit they've now been in court their
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.520]  prime evidence is the is mr stone the head of the hatari saying man the
[01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.640]  government's getting out of control and waging war on us
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.240]  we might have to fight back against them
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:28.680]  i mean that sounds like something george washington would say
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.200]  so now you don't even have that free speech and they go and arrest you but
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.880]  they they're engaging in all these busts so people kind of halfway paying
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:38.360]  attention to the newspaper and tv and radio here
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:42.120]  oh there's militias oh there's white supremacist so the media can then tie
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.440]  that into anybody criticizing the government
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:48.520]  ahead of the government false flag event we'll cover false flags when we come

[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:20.440]  uh just doing a fabulous job so i wanted to air this here
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.280]  it's a good eight minute boil down of what governments do
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.720]  and how they operate in a call to action to warn everyone
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:31.400]  that the groups that control our government the illegitimate criminals
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:35.240]  are clearly prepping the population for sustained staged
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:39.320]  terror here it is those who have studied history
[01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:43.480]  know that nothing invigorates and empowers an authoritarian regime more
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.800]  than a spectacular act of violence some sudden and senseless loss of life that
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:50.840]  allows the autocrat to stand on the smoking rubble
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.800]  and identify himself as the hero it's at moments like this that the public
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:59.160]  still in shock from the horror of the tragedy that is just unfolded before
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.440]  them can be led into the most ruthless despotism
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.040]  despotism that now bears the mantle of security
[01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:10.360]  acts of terror and violence never benefit the average man or woman
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:14.440]  they only ever benefit those in positions of power
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:18.040]  this is why nero fiddled while rome burned it gave him a chance to throw out
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.640]  the christians to the lions and rebuild the capital of the roman empire in his
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.080]  own image this is why herston the warmongers of the
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:28.760]  emerging american empire were delighted by the destruction of the uss main in
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.760]  havana harbour in 1898 it gave them the excuse they needed to
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:36.360]  rouse the public into supporting the spanish-american war
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:41.000]  this is why israel attacked the uss liberty in 1967 during the six-day war
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.160]  strafing and torpedoing it relentlessly for hours in a vain attempt to send it
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.880]  to the bottom the israelis believe that the loss of the
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:52.200]  liberty could be blamed on egypt and draw the americans into war
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:55.400]  this is why there are hundreds of documented examples of government
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.760]  staging attacks in order to blame them on their political enemies
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.000]  in every civilization in every culture in every historical period
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.280]  authoritarians have known that spectacular acts of violence help to
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.640]  further consolidate their own power and control
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:14.680]  and sadly throughout history there have been all too many willing to allow
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.320]  attacks to occur to pretend that attacks have occurred
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.800]  or even to attack their own population in order to further their political
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.960]  agenda to think that such staged provocations and false
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:30.120]  flag attacks no longer occur would be as unrealistic as believing that human
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:33.960]  nature itself has changed that powerful people no longer seek to increase
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.560]  their power that influence is never used for deceit or manipulation
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.960]  that lies are no longer told to satisfy greed or slake the thirst for control
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:44.840]  it is to believe that our society is immune from those things that we have
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.680]  seen in every other society in every other era
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:53.560]  in short it's a dangerous delusion the people are once again learning the power
[01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:57.640]  of this delusion they are learning the extent to which they have been lied to
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:01.720]  they are once again studying their history the russians are learning how
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:05.880]  the fsb was caught planting bombs in moscow in 1999 during a terror scare
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.320]  that swept putin into power and stirred the public into supporting the second
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:12.120]  chetchen war they are learning how their autocratic
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.280]  ex-president came to power campaigning on the graves of those his old fsb
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.400]  cronies had killed the israelis are learning how
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:23.160]  massad has been caught time and again posing as the very muslim terrorists
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:27.400]  they claim to be opposing they're learning how israel uses the specter of
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:30.840]  terror to further extend their blank check drawn on american funds to expand
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.440]  their police state at home and maintain their hardline stance the world's
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:37.720]  sixth largest nuclear superpower supposedly threatened by the
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:42.280]  possibility that one of their neighbors may one day obtain a single nuclear
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.240]  weapon the british are learning how their sas
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:48.680]  officers were caught dressing up as arabs in iraq driving around with trucks
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:52.680]  full of munitions shooting at police to stir up ethnic tensions and ensure
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:55.880]  that permanent bases could be built in the region
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.880]  they're learning how haruna swat the supposed mastermind behind the 77
[01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:02.920]  bombings was working for british intelligence
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:07.240]  they're learning how british military intelligence took part in ira bombings
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:10.680]  the indians are learning how the mumbai attack was helped by a u.s agent who is
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.280]  cooperating with investigators so that he won't face questioning by foreign
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:17.160]  authorities the canadiens are learning how their
[01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.520]  own provincial police dressed up as protesters in 2007 and threatened
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.040]  violence against other police in order to force a crackdown on peaceful
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:26.520]  protests
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:31.480]  and the americans the americans are learning that there were multiple
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.240]  bombs found dismantled and taken out of the alfred pima building on april
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.240]  19th 1995 they're learning that timothy mcvay
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.680]  had written a letter to his sister in which he claimed to be in the special
[01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.000]  forces for the u.s army they are learning the bombing
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.760]  was being directed by fbi informants just as the 1993 world trade center bombing
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:55.960]  was they were learning about 9-11 and the gulf
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:41:00.120]  of tonkin and operation north woods and their own army counter insurgency
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.680]  manuals that teach officers how to commit false flag
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:08.600]  attacks to blame on their enemies in short the people are learning the
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:12.760]  truth and now we see the same build-up to a false
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:16.360]  flag event taking place that we saw in 1995
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.120]  at that time the u.s had a corporate media desperate to fling mud at anyone
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:23.000]  concerned by the actions of their government and it had a government that
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.640]  was desperately unpopular today we see the exact same
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:31.320]  factors at play if anything the situation today is
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:34.520]  worse than it was in the run-up to the oklahoma city bombing with media
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:37.560]  consolidation meaning that groups of concerned citizens like the oath
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.560]  keepers are being attacked by the controlled minions on both the left
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.080]  and the right and now it is not just the militia
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:49.640]  that is being demonized by the establishment it is veterans and gun
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:52.520]  owners third-party supporters and libertarians
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.560]  anti-war protesters and human rights campaigners
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.080]  people who are upset with a government giving trillions to the banks that have
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:02.600]  engineered our current financial crisis in short
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.600]  everyone is now a potential terrorist according to the governmental and media
[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:10.040]  agencies that they need to limit our range of acceptable opinion
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:14.040]  and control dissent even the word terrorist
[01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.240]  means something more than it did back in 1995
[01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:21.400]  now after the false flag attack of 2001 allowed the passage of the patriot act
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.400]  after the boogeyman of al-ciyeda gave the NSA the opportunity to announce that
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:29.240]  they were collecting everyone's emails and everyone's telephone calls
[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:32.200]  after the former white house press secretary came out and admitted that
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.280]  the bush administration had made up terror threats in order to scare the
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  people into supporting the government now we know what the real definition of
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  terrorism is it is governments scaring their own
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:48.200]  populations into line but there is something else
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:51.640]  that's different now from what it was in 1995
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:54.760]  the people are learning something else about terrorism
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:59.080]  they are not terrorists for speaking out against their government
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:02.200]  they are not terrorists for wanting the government to stop selling their
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.800]  children into servitude to paid bankers their bonuses
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:10.840]  they are not terrorists for pointing out that the FBI and the CIA and Mossad and
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.400]  MI6 are behind every major international terrorist event
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.280]  the people are not terrorists because they do not
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:21.960]  want to see more death they do not want more destruction
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:25.320]  the spilling of the blood of their fellow citizens is not
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.000]  in their interests death and destruction
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.080]  only ever serve the governmental and financial and industrial interests
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:36.760]  who always grow in power and wealth in the wake of every
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:40.600]  tragedy time and again the people pay with their lives
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.280]  and the governments and the banks and the war machine only grows
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:49.160]  and prospers the people do not want terrorism because it does not benefit
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.200]  them it only benefits the existing power structure
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:57.800]  and this time if there is another staged event to blame on the government's
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:04.920]  enemy of the day the people will know who to blame
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:10.520]  for the Corbett report in western Japan I am James Corbett
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.080]  okay ladies and gentlemen there is the Corbett report
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:25.080]  excellent job you can go see the video up at info wars dot com and prison planet
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.200]  dot com the article that has the text of what you just heard
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:33.560]  is titled when false flags don't fly let's go ahead and take calls now let's
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:37.000]  talk to Ronnie in texas Ronnie you're on the air
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.520]  thank you sir it's Ronnie we've received but uh two quick
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.360]  shockers one death panels were paraded as a solution
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:47.800]  openly and be the our sacred constitution trading is
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:50.840]  destroying our first amendment at the same time here yesterday at the travis
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:54.600]  county commissioner's court session the commissioners received a report
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:59.480]  on the necessity for progress on so-called president so-called brock obama
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.680]  banks or two to a very sitaros health scare scam
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.400]  their advisors who run the hospitals here actually admitted that one
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:11.000]  main problem for all of us to get our proper share of our ever so limited
[01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:15.080]  resources the problem was that the expensive care needed for only a few
[01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:19.000]  sick old individuals with eating up our precious resources
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.840]  for the rest of us and when i was allowed to speak i pointed out that that
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:25.960]  talk about cutting off the care for those two expensive old
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:30.520]  individuals who were too sick to old that means death panels
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.600]  and regardless the commissioners then voted five to zero in favor
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:37.480]  in effect of death panels and by the way i'm still
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:40.600]  banned from 75 percent of the austin city council
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.360]  meetings because i'm bothered to participate when i can and that's right
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.280]  Ronnie i appreciate your call you know tom daschle who wrote the original
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.400]  bill wrote a book about death panels and how they're good
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:55.320]  uh europe has them england has them they've said that they're going to reduce
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.440]  care to the old people and people who have chronic illnesses
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.280]  that's collectivism they they they take your wealth even if you can buy your
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:05.720]  own health care and they say how much health care you can get
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.760]  they tax your health care they tax your insurance
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:12.360]  they make you buy insurance and then they lower your standard of care
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.400]  and in a collective a system they then play everyone
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:19.720]  off against each other this is what is done
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:23.400]  they then say oh that person's smoking that person's drinking that person's
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:26.280]  eating red meat and and and you know we say that's bad
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.560]  and so they're gonna have to pay more taxes or we're just going to deny them
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.480]  health care and and yes the the bioethicist boards
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:37.480]  that have been set up in the last 20 plus years and i've had wall street
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:42.040]  journal writers on you name it about it in many cases where old people or
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:46.040]  people that are paralyzed but can still talk and we've covered these cases on
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:49.640]  air when the state gets custody of them they turn their water they turn
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:54.040]  their food off they kill them and this is going on all over the
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:57.080]  country it's going on all over europe and when we say we don't want it they
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:00.680]  say you're crazy it doesn't exist you know that's dangerous rhetoric don't
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.560]  say their death panels or you may blow up a building
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:07.480]  you're not allowed in america to actually read what we're really doing
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:10.680]  but again the insurance companies wrote the legislation where they force you to
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.640]  buy their health care and then the government lets them cut the quality
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.920]  of the care and doesn't let doctors engage in medicine
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:21.000]  the hmo's and others get to say what type of health care you get
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.360]  so instead of a knee surgery you need you get a shot of cortisone
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.480]  a $50 shot instead of a $2,000 surgery and that's what they're pushing for
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:33.880]  good points uh ronnie julio in illinois you're on the air
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.040]  alex jones excited for the three o'clock premiere it's been about a year

[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:06.120]  you know reliant state uh coincidentally enough i was watching cnn on
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:09.880]  sunday morning uh two two weeks ago reliable sources talking
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:13.640]  about the exact same thing talking about pepsico
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.920]  getting sponsorship into a 30 rock show but also it was it's not really a shock
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:22.600]  that corporate media has been doing this to multi-nationalists
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:26.600]  if you look back with operation mockingbird press got pushed was
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:31.400]  you know a director of cbs news at one point back in the fifties with rca
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:37.000]  radio corporation of america to push forward propaganda during world war two

[01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.440]  you know these fall flight nuclear tech to toros talking about
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:48.280]  terrorists are more dangerous with a nuclear weapon than we are
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:52.680]  i mean what's going to happen next we see you know with blitzer falling down to

[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.600]  into this banking dictatorship they're setting up right now and they may
[01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:11.000]  uh set off a nuke and blame it on iran i mean the they're and
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.840]  every guest we've been talking to you heard dr bob bowman former head of

[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:23.480]  number one threat tarpley who's really got a good crystal ball
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:29.480]  agrees many others michael savage agrees rush limbaugh is now coming out i mean
[01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:32.760]  this is what they're going to do they know what they've done is so illegal and
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:35.560]  so bad and they're clearly saying you guys are
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:39.160]  going to cause terror get ready for it it's going to be your fault

[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:47.560]  joe and maryland joe you're on the air hey elix thank you for taking my call
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.680]  um yeah you know i i didn't hear about you either
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:56.200]  until a few months ago um uh i was this guy in front of me had a bumper sticker
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:59.960]  on his pickup truck said uh in 9-11 was an inside job
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.320]  learned the truth at info wars dot com present planet dot com and that's how i
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:07.880]  found out about you um it was uh so so i ended up
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.160]  being a member of we are changed recently and um
[01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:16.280]  down here in maryland and uh we went to go hear ralph nader talk and i asked
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.880]  him a question about the federal reserve and gave him a copy of uh
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:23.640]  fall of the republic so i was calling let you know i i gave ralph nader a copy of
[01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:27.560]  uh fall of the republic awesome and um
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:31.000]  uh look at you um what do you think about what do you think the odds are that
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:34.440]  we're uh going to enter hyperinflation
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:37.800]  we've had a lot of different economists that i really respect on and they
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:41.560]  debate it whether the elite is going to continue depressing the economy
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:45.400]  or whether they may do something new depressing the economy while having
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:49.160]  inflation or even hyperinflation uh so i guess it would be hyper
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:55.960]  stag inflation uh or or hyper depression uh but they're
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:59.320]  starting to talk about raising interest rates and that could start
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:05.240]  uh and a increase in inflation we know the government cooks the books on
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:08.600]  inflation that they manipulate the numbers on that they also manipulate
[01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:12.440]  the numbers on unemployment but we know that everything we buy
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:17.960]  costs more than it did a few years ago uh but that's not hyperinflation yet
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:23.240]  the biggest issue is the globalists have a combination of depression and the
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:27.240]  real economy but inflation or devaluation of the
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.960]  dollars so they're trying to balance the two together
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:34.280]  but that's like balancing you know cancer with a hole in the head
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:37.080]  you know a gunshot wound to the head i mean both are bad
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:40.920]  both add on to each other and that's because we live in a rigged economy
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.800]  anything else uh that was it um thank you for taking my call
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.600]  i appreciate your call from maryland scott in california you're on the year

[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:37.320]  global government has announced officially
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:40.520]  what we told you four months ago they were setting up we have a very clear view
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:43.800]  of the next step in the global banking dictatorship
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.240]  and we've got kathryn austin fits an expert on this joining us in the next
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:52.200]  segment but right now i wanted to go back to scott in california
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:56.040]  listening to us on one of the michael's whirlings great stations
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:00:59.720]  out there in santa barbara an area is going into san francisco
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:03.240]  and scott go ahead and finish up the point you wanted to make
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:07.480]  well i was just saying that i had parents that listened to me brussel and
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.960]  and made me listen to her as well and and taught me how to think
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:16.520]  not what to think so i'm sure want to thank you for carrying the uh the baton
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:21.240]  of truth and and teaching people how to think instead of what to think so
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:24.920]  kudos to you um when i was in the debate club
[02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:28.680]  we were taught that when your opponent resorts to ad hominem attacks
[02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:32.040]  the debate is one if you can keep your emotions about you and
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:35.800]  continually to think rationally so tea party members
[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:40.280]  take heart because our opponents cannot debate the issues because
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.120]  your races your terrorists your any other kind of s
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.200]  just keep your head don't give in to the anger that you're going to feel
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:51.080]  because they're only going to turn that anger and and fear
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:54.600]  well i agree but even more you need to rebuke them as as
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:57.640]  as worse than racist because it's one thing to be an ignorant racist
[02:01:57.640 --> 02:02:01.240]  it's another to consciously try to turn groups against each other
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:05.160]  in a cold-blooded way i mean that is that that is horrible
[02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:09.080]  mm-hmm what i was talking to a friend about this and in the new world order
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.320]  and i keep telling him you know you don't realize
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:14.600]  what they are doing to you and how you how they're controlling the way you
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:19.160]  think and but i keep using this this this uh ambiguous
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:23.560]  them so we're thinking we need to have the leaders of the new world order
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.400]  maybe like uh like when we went into uh uh
[02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:33.560]  uh... baseball cards yeah the baseball cards or or or playing cards and have
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.320]  these guys
[02:02:35.320 --> 02:02:40.840]  on record uh... some sort of uh... tangible item that you can hand people
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.680]  uh... and if we can ever get these people arrested put them behind bars
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:48.520]  you know you put a big stamp on it that way this but this can get passed around
[02:02:48.520 --> 02:02:51.880]  uh... i don't know if anybody in your team would be uh... you know the problem
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.240]  is there's so many globalists you have to make about 20 decks of cards
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:57.560]  and people have done something similar i've thought about it
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:02.120]  we could have the bankster deck the the the political criminal deck
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:06.760]  uh... the police state deck uh... the new world order uh... occult deck
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:10.520]  and it's a great idea and uh... a lot of people thought of it
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:14.280]  it's just the time and energy that would go into it i can make a film that gets
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:20.360]  seen by 20 million people online uh... and so all my time goes into the films
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:24.440]  and radio because per capita they're the best bang for the buck
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:28.200]  and the time and the energy but it's a great idea we've actually promoted
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:30.840]  some of the folks out there that do have these card decks
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.720]  uh... some of the card decks i agree with some really i don't think of the power
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:37.160]  structure right but i know that's a great idea but somebody's come out the
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:41.800]  whole line of these cards but also have a very inexpensive
[02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:45.160]  some people that made them it's such limited runs they want to get their
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:47.960]  money back so they're expensive they need to be super cheap
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:52.840]  like two three bucks a deck so people can buy these decks in mass
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:56.120]  and give them to everybody they know uh... but we're thinking about
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:59.160]  uh... making a deck i've been wanting to do it for more than a decade anything
[02:03:59.160 --> 02:04:03.480]  else uh... there scott a couple of questions uh... sir
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:09.080]  are you planning on committing suicide i will know i will never kill myself and
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.520]  of the uh... gov and if the government says i did it's a lie
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:15.640]  well thank you for putting your life on the line and helping to awaken the
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:17.560]  human consciousness the other question
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:21.240]  the love of money is the root of all evil how long before we as a species
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:25.320]  start valuing people for what they bring to the table of ideas instead of how
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:28.600]  how many ones and zeros that can be transferred between accounts
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.520]  in a nanosecond all right i appreciate your call i i appreciate your call
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.880]  answer that briefly when we come back and we're going to catherine austin

[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:01.960]  other side
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:08.680]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:12.360]  has become reality it really says that the state is god
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.200]  the united states is now recognized globally is one of the most oppressive
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:19.880]  police states on earth this film conclusively proves the
[02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:22.600]  existence of a secret network of fema cams
[02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:27.160]  now being expanded nationwide this documentary exposes of the continuity

[02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:23.640]  okay i had a caller in california saying
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:29.240]  that he wanted my comments on money being the root of all evil
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:33.480]  and that's a cliche that's used and there's some truth to it but it's more
[02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:37.560]  money-changing fraudulent money dealings
[02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:41.320]  uh fractional reserve banking i mean what did jesus christ do he went into
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.240]  the temple and the the scribes and Pharisees made
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:49.560]  you buy your sacrifice of a dove or a calf whatever it was you were buying
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.240]  for the sacrifice for the remission of sins
[02:08:53.240 --> 02:08:57.720]  you know under jewish law they would make you buy it with a certain very rare
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:01.640]  coin a silver coin that silver wise didn't have
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.600]  a lot of value but because it was a rare coin in scarce
[02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:08.600]  you had to pay for it with a bunch of gold and that's what he went in and
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.520]  overturned the fact that they were turning it into a business
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.360]  people in there uh you know carrying out their sacrifice
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:19.400]  people say well why sacrifice something for your sins you're saying i'm giving
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:22.040]  something up i'm giving some valuable food up that i
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:24.680]  could sell or i could eat you know i'm saying
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:28.840]  you know to to god this is the main focus uh
[02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.680]  you know i'm giving something up for this you're most important you are my
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:37.560]  idol no other idols before you and i look at it as a hierarchy of
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:41.320]  needs if somebody can make a billion dollars
[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:45.480]  without hurting someone and doing good in the process that's wonderful
[02:09:45.480 --> 02:09:49.880]  but money can't be the top of your pyramid it's a hierarchy of needs
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.200]  i mean my hierarchy of needs is i love my family i love my children
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:57.000]  uh i mean i woke up last night in the middle of the night and was just like
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  almost having a vision of just a beautiful ocean and a sunset and how
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.760]  beautiful that is and how i just want to go live by the seashore and
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:08.040]  you know hang out with my family in oil paint we don't we all wish we could do
[02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:12.120]  that uh and and just this pull to quit this
[02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:17.000]  this this ever-increasing drive to stop doing what i'm doing
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:20.520]  the frustration that i have to be here every day fighting these people because
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:24.200]  we have no future if we don't fight them and my anger at them
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:28.120]  uh this isn't some ego trip it's not fun out here fighting the new world order
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:31.880]  it is survival but things get twisted the system
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:35.080]  then says give the government all your money we're going to help the poor
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.880]  don't love money but really they're using that
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:42.040]  your well-meaning guilt to get your money to get control of your life so they
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:45.400]  can make you dependent i believe it's good for people to be
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.880]  wealthy i like it when people are doing well i like seeing healthy happy
[02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:52.920]  people with nice houses and swimming pools and plenty of food
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.040]  i know that also tends to bring decadence but
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:58.840]  it's good to be able to have a car that doesn't break down it's good to be able
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:02.120]  to travel it's good to be able to pay for medicine for your family
[02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:06.280]  but would you kill somebody for an ipad would you kill somebody for 500 bucks
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.480]  on their wallet would you kill somebody for a billion bucks
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:13.560]  would you plant wmds in iraq would you stage a 9-11
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:17.800]  and so i don't believe money or even the love of money
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.240]  is the root of all evil because you know if you like
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.840]  being successful and comfortable and secure
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.440]  i guess you call that love but is that what you love the most
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:32.040]  you know what what do you idolize first the truth honor
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:34.600]  telling the truth
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:40.600]  because the hatred of money then almost turns into another class in the system
[02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.440]  and then they use the underclass to rob the middle class and the elite is
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.000]  manipulating that so it's very sophisticated and kathryn

[02:12:28.200 --> 02:12:31.320]  would you like to comment on your view about money
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.760]  and and it is the love of it the root of all evil
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:38.040]  well we're talking about two investment models
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:43.080]  um the old investment model which is in the process of changing and i'd like to
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:46.280]  talk about the new one too but the the old one says
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:50.840]  as long as i have a positive return to me or my shareholders
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.160]  and what i'm doing is lawful that's okay okay so
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.840]  if you go to the texas pension funds where you are if you go to the tennessee
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:03.080]  pension funds and you say to them what impact is it having on your communities
[02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:06.200]  that you're putting this money in these mortgage back securities they'll say i
[02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.720]  don't know because i'm not responsible to understand
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:13.880]  my impact on the greater ecosystem i leave that to government
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:17.320]  and we're going into a world alex where we're going to come up with a new model
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:21.000]  and the model is going to look like this and the model is going to say okay
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.400]  you have a return to your investors or your shareholders or your
[02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:28.840]  family or your pension fund beneficiaries but then you have an impact on your
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:32.440]  financial ecosystem you know in the greater world
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:36.520]  so so we want to make sure that our investments have a have a positive
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.800]  return to the system and a positive return to us
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:43.080]  and we use the information of understanding the impact of our
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.080]  investments to protect ourselves against risk so for example if all the
[02:13:47.080 --> 02:13:50.280]  state pension funds all the union pension funds all the
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.840]  corvind pension funds in this country had said
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:57.560]  i want to understand the impact my money's having on my financial ecosystem
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.360]  it would have protected them for making investments that we're ultimately going
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:05.000]  to lose the money because they would have seen wait a minute
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.520]  if i'm destroying the middle class and wiping out the middle class i can't
[02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:12.520]  possibly be good for for my investments in municipalities
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:15.400]  and places i'm going to lose money on this ultimately
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.320]  if i do things that are harmful so we're going from an investment
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:23.240]  model where people didn't need to understand their participate
[02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:26.920]  participation participation in the ecosystem
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.120]  to one where they're going to have to be much more awake about what their
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  impact is because that's going to be an essential risk management tool in a
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.480]  world that's much more global much more integrated and we're
[02:14:37.480 --> 02:14:41.880]  capitals moving much faster so what we're literally talking about is a
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:46.360]  complete reinvention it's simple but it's profound in terms of your
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:51.000]  operations if you're running money a real invention of the investment model
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.880]  okay i should have pointed out at the beginning i had you on a few weeks ago
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:57.960]  about the problem and and and and how this operation works who
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:15:02.280]  we're facing what they're setting up the model they want
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:05.480]  who they are and what the establishment wants versus
[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:11.400]  uh your idea and others idea of how to have a non-destructive non-predatory
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.200]  system but just going back to what the caller was asking me
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:18.840]  there's this other idea that ever having any wealth is bad in and of itself
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.480]  when in truth don't good people need to get in a position of being sustainable
[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:28.440]  powerful spins that the new world order promotes is that wealth is bad
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:31.320]  and let me tell you something that's not coming from the grassroots that's
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.920]  coming from the top because when you if if
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:38.280]  everybody who's got a solution says wealth is bad
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:41.480]  then they're going to they're going to keep sending their money to wall street
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:44.920]  there nobody's going to shift their retirement capital into a group of people
[02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:49.800]  and a and a new model that says wealth is bad you know we've all worked you know
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:54.040]  we we have a whole generation now alex that have worked their entire life many
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.080]  of them work very hard to accumulate this capital
[02:15:57.080 --> 02:15:59.880]  and this capital is the one thing standing between their family and the
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:03.080]  abyss of the last thing we need to say is oh that's bad
[02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:06.200]  that's good that's what's protecting people so
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:09.960]  so in fact what we needed an investment model that says
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:13.880]  optimization and the creation and the building of wealth
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:18.920]  is good because it is you know there's no such thing as too much energy
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:22.520]  the question is how you channel and use it because money's just a tool
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:26.520]  exactly the robber baron class has written in many policy papers
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:30.600]  that they're waging war against the middle class that allows the working
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:33.720]  class to have upward mobility the united states one of the few countries in
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:37.400]  history that's had a large middle class that trends now reversed it's
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:39.960]  disappearing and it's always the big central banks
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:43.160]  that push for the income tax that push for command and control
[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:47.720]  because it's the ultra rich robbing the rest of humanity and they want a
[02:16:47.720 --> 02:16:51.800]  two-tier tiny elite giant underclass system where no one can ever challenge
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:54.360]  them now for those that just joined us and i'm going to sit back on the shower
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:58.760]  now and give you the floor recap briefly going into break
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.760]  who the elite are the type of economy they've set up where we're going
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:06.280]  so people understand how important it is uh to go with
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:10.600]  your alternative well that's the 64 thousand dollar question
[02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:14.600]  is you know who are they and and i can only talk from what i know
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:16.920]  because i'm not you know i'm not sitting in the
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.200]  provian well tell us what's their model tell them i mean right like you did
[02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:23.960]  actually what you have is at the very top of the investment
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:28.680]  hierarchy on this planet you have intergenerational pools of capital that
[02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:32.040]  are controlled and owned by private families they're
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:35.480]  unbelievably centralized and they operate through
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:39.320]  a whole series of bureaucracies which you describe which is the
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:42.760]  you know the central banks and the insurance industry and the builder
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:45.160]  burgers and the council on farm relations and there's
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:48.600]  umpteen billion secret societies coordinating all the stuff because it's
[02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.520]  a big planet um but at the very very top you have a small
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:55.960]  number of huge intergenerational pools of capital
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:18:00.600]  that have remarkable control and it and it is remarkably centralized and very
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:03.880]  planned and we've reached the point where
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:07.720]  you know where we've had a real breakdown in alignment of the interests of
[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:10.920]  the folks at the top and everybody else so
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.880]  so they kind of feel they're much better off with
[02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:18.280]  unbelievable control and i'm afraid if you look at the agricultural and other
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.240]  policies you know it's clear that we are on a
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:26.680]  trajectory for significant um you know i would predict
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:31.000]  significant depopulation so so there's a real breakdown in
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:34.200]  interest and if you look at all the people in our
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:37.320]  society alex are saying this is wrong and this is wrong
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:40.120]  and they're talking about the money is wrong or the corruption is wrong or
[02:18:40.120 --> 02:18:43.640]  wall street is wrong or nine eleven is wrong or vaccines are wrong
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.640]  the most all of those things are symptoms they're symptoms of the
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:50.920]  fundamental problem which is a governance problem which is
[02:18:50.920 --> 02:18:56.280]  who's in charge and why are they destroying significant amounts of
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:59.320]  freedom and wealth because our problem in this in this world
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:02.360]  is not that there's too much wealth you're watching the centralization of
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:06.920]  economic control in a way that is significantly reducing wealth
[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:11.880]  significantly reducing wealth yeah they've sold the kind of underclass
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:14.760]  that wealth is what's hurting them no it's that there's not
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:18.280]  enough wealth and we can turn the engine of wealth loose
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:21.640]  and we can colonize the stars it's unlimited there's enough for everybody
[02:19:21.640 --> 02:19:24.680]  it's really funny in the nineteen nineties i started a company in
[02:19:24.680 --> 02:19:27.720]  washington and call him up in securities group
[02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:30.760]  and coming out of the bush administration i said you know entrepreneurs
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:33.880]  are going to have to get government money out of communities and we're gonna
[02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:36.600]  turn this thing around and we were putting together a plan
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:40.840]  where small business had easy access to all the information about how money
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:43.320]  worked in their place including government contracts
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:47.800]  which is as you know a big part of the economy and they also could put together
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:51.160]  little venture funds and mutual funds for their community stay there let's talk
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:54.040]  about your plan that got nixed on the other side

[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:11.720]  hundreds of billions of dollars and her colleagues
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:14.920]  discovered that this trend was beginning to basically steal all the wealth and
[02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:18.200]  destroy wealth and now we have the big banks saying they
[02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:21.640]  want a world government we're going to pay a value added tax on all financial
[02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:24.200]  transactions that's how they're going to get the banks
[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:28.360]  but the money's paid to the elite banks so
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.120]  we've got to identify this threat but not just identify it we've got to talk
[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:36.760]  about other alternatives to use the power of currency and credit
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:40.600]  to build healthy communities katherine austin fits please
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:44.280]  continue with the other plan yes so i want to i'm telling you
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:47.960]  about the time when i discovered how huge the opportunity was
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:52.120]  because i did i didn't understand in the 90s alex until this happened
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:55.400]  how much the system is being used to shrink wealth
[02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:59.320]  in other words you know to keep people poor anyway so
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:03.080]  so we're doing this thing where we're making software tools we made a
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:05.720]  software tool called community wizard which will allow anybody in a
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:09.720]  community to dial in and see you know because if we look at the
[02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:13.320]  the u.s budget we see here's how the money works in housing or military
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:17.480]  we never see it contiguous to the areas that we vote for representation
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:21.400]  so you never see sources and uses of government appropriations contracts and
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:24.360]  credit for your congressional district which is
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:27.320]  of course what you need to hold your congressman accountable
[02:25:27.320 --> 02:25:32.120]  so so anyway so so we we took relational database technology and we
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:36.120]  reconfigured all the databases so that you could start to look at your money
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:39.480]  by place and we were putting together venture funds and mutual funds for your
[02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:42.840]  neighborhood so you could literally put your 401k
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:47.160]  in a pool that would invest in local businesses and you could in theory
[02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:50.200]  you could trade and you know you could go to bloomberg and see what your
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.920]  neighborhood was trading trading at theory so
[02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:59.480]  so we're working away at this and um i had this smart guy uh it's a phd from
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:02.440]  mit absolutely brings through the smartest guy the company
[02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.920]  and i said okay let's assume that we re-engineer all the government money
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:11.480]  so that so that we optimize total equity in the 3100 counties because
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:14.040]  america just breaks down into 3100 counties
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:17.800]  so let's say we really you know we completely changed how we did the
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:21.240]  government money so that we could create as much
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:24.120]  business wealth whether it's big companies or small companies
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:27.560]  and he went off and did the numbers alex and he came back and i looked at him i
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:31.400]  said that's impossible that he was saying
[02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:35.400]  within a short period of time we could get a six times multiple of total
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:39.560]  equity outstanding in the country alone let alone globally
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:42.760]  and i just couldn't believe so i made him go back and do the numbers a couple
[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:46.120]  times and dug in it and and did the numbers and i realized
[02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:51.000]  oh my god we're spending the entire federal budget the way that totally
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.320]  shrinks innovation entrepreneurship cuts off
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:26:59.080]  capital to so much of the healthy economy which is what you're seeing now in
[02:26:59.080 --> 02:27:03.800]  the way the credit crunch is being engineered we're shutting off money
[02:27:03.800 --> 02:27:07.800]  to all these different productive sectors and if we stop doing it the wealth
[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:12.440]  could be enormous i mean you know there's really no reason
[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:15.400]  for there to be poverty at all we have the resources
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:18.760]  and a part of it is you know because you've covered this is the sort of
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:23.720]  you know suppression of new technology and i was astonished and i you know for
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:27.240]  about a week i just walked around laughing i couldn't stop laughing because
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:31.320]  i realized you know there's plenty of money there really is no problem at all
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.520]  and then of course the department of justice east our offices and stole all
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:38.040]  the databases and kept them under lock and key for six years
[02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:42.920]  which is when i discovered you know that there really is an intentional effort
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:47.080]  to channel capital and restrict it in a way that really keeps things very much
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:50.280]  under control and we're running the economy
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:54.600]  to achieve centralized control not to achieve wealth if anything we're trying
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:58.200]  to reduce the middle class to a state of you know not having
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:01.160]  the wealth that that really supports freedom
[02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:05.400]  because our constitution and our freedoms alex
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:09.400]  really depend on not being not having our
[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:14.600]  digital data and our our physical bodies and our money controlled by somebody
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:17.960]  else very centrally and should that even be
[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:21.640]  surprising to us you look at the japanese feudal model
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:25.080]  you look at the european continental model the last thousand years you look
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:29.720]  at the british model of the last 800 uh... you look at all of these systems
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:34.120]  it was written down in handbooks by the royalty and their lords
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:39.080]  to keep people at a subsistence level to make them more easily controlled i mean
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:42.600]  this is the way the world has always worked it was only the renaissance of
[02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:46.280]  the enlightenment that reversed that and we saw all these inventions
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:50.360]  and technology and wealth and the non-existent middle class suddenly
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:55.480]  appeared right and now so now we have a new problem and if we're going to solve
[02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:58.680]  if we're going to build a new alternative to the new world order
[02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:01.640]  then we have to grapple with some of the issues that they're legitimately
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:06.040]  grappling with which is we have new powerful communications
[02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:09.320]  and digital technology and that technology
[02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:13.560]  alex allows some groups to have phenomenally high learning speed
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:17.720]  and what has happened in this country is some people have shot way ahead and
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.480]  you know gone much faster whereas other people have sat back and said i don't
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:25.640]  want to change but what i want is i want to continue to get my check and so
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:29.400]  we've had a political process in this country which wasn't democracy
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.480]  it was simply politicians buying electries with their own money stay there
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:37.960]  let's talk about that because the elite are creating a giant domesticated mass
[02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:41.480]  that they can use as a weapon against the tiny middle class that's left
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:44.920]  then once they get rid of them they remove the chicken feed from their slaves

[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:19.640]  possibilities it means all the world under their
[02:32:19.640 --> 02:32:22.920]  control the united nations would take over america

[02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:31.240]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:35.080]  to establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all
[02:32:35.080 --> 02:32:38.280]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:42.040]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the g20
[02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:45.720]  so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else

[02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.480]  kathryn austin fits here in just a moment with her discovery that the system
[02:33:23.480 --> 02:33:27.320]  knew that there was almost a limited wealth generation capacity
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:30.760]  and that they didn't want that instead they wanted to go in the opposite
[02:33:30.760 --> 02:33:34.040]  direction towards wealth destruction what do the
[02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:37.880]  fake environmentalists say what does morris strong say world government
[02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:42.200]  global carbon taxes to shut off industrial development
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:44.840]  but even if you don't like industrial development there's so many other
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:48.840]  economies they're stifling it all because that's how they control the
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:52.120]  economy don't forget we premiered invisible empire
[02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.240]  our new order defined last week to rave reviews dvd available at info wars

[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:14.840]  of the radio broadcast in an hour and a half okay kathryn austin fits for those
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:18.760]  that just joined us assistant secretary of housing federal housing commissioner
[02:34:18.760 --> 02:34:24.360]  for bush 41 investment banker portfolio strategy of over 300 billion of
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:28.680]  financial assets and liabilities she's uh designed and closed over 25
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:32.520]  billion of transactions herself she of course was on the board of dylan
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:37.560]  reid and the uh just a top analyst out there
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:41.720]  such a great financial brain we're honored to have her
[02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:46.360]  kathryn continuing where we left off with you have this awakening
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:50.440]  you discover from the numbers that the system is designed to suppress wealth
[02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:56.600]  please continue so i went through it took me about 10 years to finish
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:59.960]  learning how to litigate successfully with the federal government but
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:03.400]  what i discovered alex is the real solutions are going to have to come
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:07.320]  from the grassroots and the important question is not how do we turn this
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:10.840]  around but how do how do we get energy turning it around
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:14.280]  because what we have to do every person is listening to this call is being
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:19.320]  drained by this process and what we need to do is reverse the drain we need to
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:22.360]  reverse the drain in our individual lives and then in
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:25.560]  our family and then our community and it goes out
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:29.240]  and so you know that uh if you come to our web
[02:35:29.240 --> 02:35:33.560]  one of our websites says redeeming the monetary system one customer at a time
[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:37.560]  so we have to do this and you know we have to do this individually
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:40.680]  can't wait for the big solutions on how we're going to have to turn this around
[02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:44.840]  ourselves and so the question i've been working on since then in you know
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:47.640]  whether it's me personally or in my businesses
[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:51.480]  is how do i start to get back my power
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:54.360]  and how do i prevent the drain in my life because
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:58.280]  because essentially if you look at our money we're all being harvested by the
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:03.320]  system and so that's what we have to do is is we need the wealth growing
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:07.160]  and we need it in a way which it's growing in your pocket in my pocket in
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:09.720]  the pocket of everybody listening to this call
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:14.920]  okay so if they want a wealth destroying model we want a wealth building model
[02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.960]  and the way you do that is by building your wealth and my wealth and the wealth
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:23.000]  of everybody on this phone call okay so so one of the things i'd like to do is
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:26.760]  to walk through let's look at each person's time
[02:36:26.760 --> 02:36:30.920]  and our health and our money and just make some simple suggestions
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:34.520]  of what we can do to reverse the drain in our lives and if all this start to do
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:36.840]  it it's going to have an unbelievably dramatic
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:41.960]  fact effect on shifting power and wealth out of the new world order and much
[02:36:41.960 --> 02:36:46.360]  more into the grassroots so let's just talk about an individual
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:50.280]  and the first most important thing you have to do alex is you have to protect
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:54.520]  your time because time is so so valuable in this environment and
[02:36:54.520 --> 02:36:57.720]  and i just want to tell everyone and they probably know it because they're
[02:36:57.720 --> 02:37:01.720]  listening to the alex joneshow but we've got to get radical about
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:05.240]  getting unreliable in people uh unreliable people in
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:08.680]  information out of our lives particularly corporate media
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:12.040]  i mean if you look at what's going on you don't even have the time to
[02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:16.360]  be entertained by the disinformation because it's such a complete waste of
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:20.120]  time um so please turn off corporate media
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:23.160]  i want to tell you you know i often tell people to bank
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:27.720]  locally and i'm often asked um you know well
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:30.760]  it's much more convenient or isn't it really okay to
[02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:34.680]  to to bank at the at the big banks and i just want to tell a story of what
[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:39.480]  happened to me in the last week in the last three days my company has
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:45.560]  gotten hit by two unauthorized ACHs electronic transfers from big banks
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:49.800]  it's going to take us five to seven hours this week just to reverse them
[02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:52.600]  and it's not going to be a problem for us because we have a great local
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:57.480]  community bank but that's the kind of tax these guys put on people
[02:37:57.480 --> 02:38:00.680]  you know you literally just wake up and and they've taken money out of your
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:03.240]  account it's not authorized it's incredible
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.520]  and that's why you want to get as far away from these guys you don't want them
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:10.280]  to have an authorization to dip into your account because then things like this
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:12.920]  are going to happen
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:17.640]  they're there yes i'm here i'm just i'm just listening to you
[02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:21.640]  so get radical about getting these people out of any relationship with you
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:25.080]  that can eat up your time okay so that's number one time
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:28.680]  number two is help get radical about environmental pollution
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:32.600]  i just did a salaried report on chemtrails just because i want people to
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:35.240]  understand the kind of poisoning that's literally
[02:38:35.240 --> 02:38:38.600]  you know i have so many subscribers who take wonderful care of themselves
[02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:42.280]  they're responsible about their health you know they eat the right food and
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:44.440]  everything so they think they're okay
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:48.760]  and we need to understand we're not and whether it's chemtrails or vaccines or
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:52.440]  any all the things you've covered these really are
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:56.520]  enormous stresses and strains on our immune system
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:01.160]  and a buildup of detox of toxicity that can really hurt a person
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:04.680]  and i'm an investment advisor alex and there's nothing that will hurt your
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:08.360]  financial position more than bad health i mean bad health is
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:13.560]  is really the cause of more more bankruptcies and financial problems in
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:16.680]  this country than anything else well since you're killing me to interrupt i'm
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:19.480]  trying to be polite because i want to hear what you have to say i'll interrupt
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:23.560]  and again i'm not up here on a mountain alex it's unnerving
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:27.720]  no but i don't want to sit up here on a mountain because i'm certainly
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.320]  not as healthy as i should be but absolutely you know the bible says that
[02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:35.880]  you've got to get your temple clean and your self clean first before you can
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:40.360]  start fixing your life and then your city your county your state the world
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:43.480]  and so we've all number one got to feel good about ourselves
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:47.240]  realize that this madison avenue system is there to make us feel insecure
[02:39:47.240 --> 02:39:50.040]  so they can then sell us their false solutions we've got to feel good about
[02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:53.240]  ourselves we've got to get our relationship with god going again
[02:39:53.240 --> 02:39:56.600]  and we've got to realize that we've got to take action against this evil and just
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.880]  start taking a walk every morning start eating healthier stop drinking
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:04.280]  fluoridated water i mean there's a reason and the evidence has been
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:07.800]  very clear on this for new listeners we've reached the point where if you walk
[02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:10.040]  into the average you know typical grocery
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:14.280]  store the food is not safe to eat i you know it's amazing and that's done by
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:17.080]  design i mean the globalists are poisoning the food and water
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:20.840]  they have genetically engineered the crops every major crop they found
[02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:24.440]  just so happens to make you sick just so happens to give you stomach problems
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:28.760]  just so happens to reduce fertility no they've been caught engineering it into
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:32.120]  these i mean they know what they're doing any data about this there's a
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.040]  wonderful uh dvd made in 2006 it's up online you
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:38.840]  can get it on my blog it's called killer at large
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:42.920]  and and it really focuses on what they're doing to the children with the food
[02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:46.120]  and i you know particularly if your kids or grandkids
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:49.640]  please watch killer at large uh you know there's another great one
[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:53.880]  supersized me there are lots of great dvds on the food system but
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:57.800]  making sure that you and your family have fresh food and clean water without
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:41:02.440]  fluoridation and all the chemicals is so so important and then i would include
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:05.640]  in the health area the ability to protect yourself
[02:41:05.640 --> 02:41:09.960]  so getting the proper training in you know if you if you want to bear arms
[02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.200]  great protecting the right to bear arms and doing whatever you have to do to
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.640]  protect yourself now for people who are in a county where you have a great
[02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:20.840]  sheriff and you can communicate with your sheriff and you have the right
[02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:24.520]  sheriff and police supports that's great but more and more alex many of us are
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:29.880]  not you know in that week two years ago we had to organize to
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.000]  all the all the women or i shouldn't say all the women a whole bunch of us in
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.200]  the hickory valley women's club went out bought guns got training got our
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:40.120]  permits and you know there was lots of jokes about
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:43.000]  everybody who was married to somebody in the hickory valley women's club had to
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:47.640]  sleep with a you know a bulletproof vest
[02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:51.880]  but you know we haven't had any problems since then so so part of health in this
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:55.160]  environment is making sure you know how to protect yourself and your family and
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:41:58.600]  that probably is going to require some training at some time
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.520]  then then the third category after time in health is money
[02:42:02.520 --> 02:42:07.160]  and there's so many things we can do with our money to completely shift
[02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:10.680]  you know stop the drain from happening because the inflation alex
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:16.200]  is killing us and it's funny because i constantly say as subscribers why have
[02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:19.640]  your money in a money market account when you can put your money in tangibles
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:23.880]  any non-perishable that you know you're going to use in the next two years
[02:42:23.880 --> 02:42:28.040]  if you buy it now given the inflation i mean we've seen food prices up six
[02:42:28.040 --> 02:42:33.080]  percent or more so far this year so if if you put it in a non-perishable and
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.960]  just um let the value of that inventory go up
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:41.160]  then in fact you don't have to pay tax on that capital gain and you're getting
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:43.880]  a much better yield than you are in the money market so that
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:48.600]  there's a fundamental shift going on between tangibles and financial assets
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:51.560]  tangibles are just going to keep getting more and more valuable
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:55.560]  and that has a radical impact on how we think of our
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:59.000]  investments you know a lot of people say oh well diverse you need to be
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.120]  diversified and what they mean by that is you need to have
[02:43:02.120 --> 02:43:05.960]  different kinds of corporate securities in your in your brokerage account
[02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:09.080]  that's nonsense what you need to do is have money outside of the brokerage
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:13.160]  system and and be much more invested in tangibles
[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:17.400]  and carry much less debt because debt has risks involved
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:21.480]  you know i may be getting a higher yield on my investments that i'm paying on my
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:25.720]  mortgage but there are real risks associated to having with debt and
[02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:29.400]  now as people are losing their jobs we're all discovering that so
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:33.880]  it's very important alex to get radical about lowering our overhead and
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:38.040]  radical about lowering our debt getting rid of things we don't need
[02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:41.560]  focusing on what's important and finding out you didn't need most this junk
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:45.160]  what you really need is your freedom now now going back though comprehensive
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:48.920]  annual financial reports we know this started in Chicago
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:53.080]  in the 40s it was adopted nationwide in the 50s a double set of books county
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:57.880]  city school districts water districts universities federal
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:44:02.120]  departments they have a real set of books that are their investments
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:05.880]  and then they have their supposed budget which they always have a shortfall on
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:09.640]  but that's only a small part of what they're doing and now they've tricked
[02:44:09.640 --> 02:44:12.760]  the counties the cities the the public pension funds
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:16.360]  the private pension funds and others to invest
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:20.040]  in the derivatives in the banks because they were getting a good return
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:23.240]  now we hear all these states thought they were getting a good return they were
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:26.120]  getting a good return until they started to lose money
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:30.440]  exactly but that was the big that was the big setup and so now
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:34.360]  we've got bloomberg and others reporting the federal regulators are
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:39.560]  ordering the public pension funds to quote invest in failed banks
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:46.680]  since when can regulators order the the heads of the pension funds to invest in
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:48.760]  quote failed banks that sounds like a pretty bad
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:52.040]  investment somebody comes to me and says look i've you know i've done everything
[02:44:52.040 --> 02:44:55.880]  i can to turn around the drain and my you know on my own finances and my family
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:59.880]  i've got extra time i want to be involved in my community the first thing i
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:03.320]  say is you know the new world order is pulling a
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:07.080]  ton of money out of your community through local state and government
[02:45:07.080 --> 02:45:10.040]  through the pension funds and if you can simply
[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:13.880]  understand the game bring transparency and start to turn that around
[02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:19.160]  the opportunities for wealth creation are absolutely phenomenal alex and it's
[02:45:19.160 --> 02:45:23.000]  it's just so huge that no one can even imagine how big it is
[02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:26.920]  but i agree with you if you look at our state local government finances
[02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:32.280]  let's start with a simple one let the job engine in this country is small
[02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:36.360]  business okay so you have great local families with great
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:40.120]  local businesses whether they're banks or stores or other
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:44.360]  operations in your community they are the job engine they are the
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:47.960]  the thing that's keeping your community going in many respects
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:51.400]  and if you look at the government bank deposits
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:54.600]  the government investments the government contracts the government
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:58.440]  purchases those are going not to those great local
[02:45:58.440 --> 02:46:02.040]  businesses um or you know the great businesses in the
[02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:04.760]  state they could if they're going out to places like
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:07.480]  wall street so i always use the example of the food
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:12.680]  stamp program here in tennessee we are we have counties in tennessee alex
[02:46:12.680 --> 02:46:16.040]  that have 25 an employment rate but meantime
[02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:19.880]  we are outsourcing our data servicing and customer support
[02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:24.040]  on our state food bank i mean a food stamp program
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.960]  are you ready for this to jp morgan chase in india
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:31.800]  so jobs that could be being done in tennessee and counties where there's
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:34.840]  because these are digitally you can shoot these with telecommunications
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:40.040]  exactly even the bureaucracy to deliver the welfare of dependency
[02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:44.120]  has been globalized to make sure that none of the money ever gets back to the
[02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.840]  community right and nobody connects the dots because
[02:46:46.840 --> 02:46:50.440]  that knowledge those data well here's another example i saw in the ap last
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:54.200]  week with a texas case and the legislatures complaining
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:59.720]  they're taking existing roads giving stimulus money to centra of spain to
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.320]  come in and put toll roads on it and paying them
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:06.760]  paying them stimulus money to put the toll road
[02:47:06.760 --> 02:47:09.880]  gates and license plate reading cameras in
[02:47:09.880 --> 02:47:13.560]  and it it came out that's illegal to use stimulus money for a toll road but they
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:16.360]  just don't care i mean this is incredible
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.120]  well it's incredible i mean in my little town of hickory valley there was a
[02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:24.360]  proposal to put up a cell tower at our city hall
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:28.520]  and use a government grant to do it when private parties were going to own it
[02:47:28.520 --> 02:47:33.240]  but the government was going to pay i think for half of it it's unbelievable
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:37.400]  so you know that the money is clearly out of control and i think
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:41.960]  you know we're seeing incredible polls in the last two weeks rest mucin
[02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:46.920]  polls basically uh... in election between ron paul and obama today they're
[02:47:46.920 --> 02:47:50.440]  basically even and we've seen other polls alex
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:54.680]  showing that people of all parts of the political spectrum agree more with the
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:57.800]  tea parties than they agree with any political party
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:00.360]  republican or democrat and so you're watching
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:03.800]  a very powerful unification start to happen
[02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:07.640]  around you know americans believe in the constitution
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:11.560]  and the importance of running the money clean you know simple basic issues
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:15.400]  and and now with april fifteenth behind us wanting
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:18.600]  nobody wants taxation without representation which is really where
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:21.560]  we've gotten with the bailouts and now with the health care bill
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:26.520]  and so i think you're starting to see a very powerful new consensus emerge
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:30.280]  in america which is our real opportunity saying wait a minute
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:34.120]  you know this system is has no legitimacy
[02:48:34.120 --> 02:48:37.720]  it has no legitimacy under the constitution it has no
[02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:42.040]  legitimacy under the law and the funny thing of the conundrum
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:45.080]  that the weakest you remember in in uh...
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:49.400]  star war with star wars where they they have the hole in the death star the
[02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:53.960]  the death star has won vulnerability yes let me tell you where the vulnerability
[02:48:53.960 --> 02:48:58.200]  is for the new world order you know the hole in their death star
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:03.960]  and that is that as a bureaucracy they have promoted all sorts of wonderful
[02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:08.040]  things the the most wonderful being the constitution in the declaration of
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.400]  independence and the second most wonderful being all sorts of
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:16.440]  of fiduciary laws related to the money and if you look at their operation
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.520]  they are they are in direct and intentional violation
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:24.200]  to criminal standards on those two laws
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:29.000]  and and what is happening that's so powerful is the tea party group
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:32.120]  the you know sort of the other people rising up and saying
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:38.040]  this is wrong have have embraced constitutional principles
[02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:41.640]  the principles of the declaration of independence and all the fiduciary laws
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.000]  related to money and so you've got a very interesting
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:48.040]  switch of what the chinese call the mandate of heaven
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:51.160]  because the tea party in ron paul and his group
[02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:54.040]  have got the mandate of heaven according to
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:57.240]  you know hundreds of years old traditional uh
[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:01.560]  american values and american law let me just interrupt i mean i i mean to
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:05.480]  boil it down the banks the offshore corporations are engaged in a
[02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:09.880]  hospital corporate takeover it's purely illegal they raise our taxes
[02:50:09.880 --> 02:50:13.320]  for corporate welfare to be paid to them by the government they also come in and
[02:50:13.320 --> 02:50:17.240]  buy off the city managers to invest most of our tax money
[02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:22.360]  in their derivatives so that's another tax to the private banks it's illegal
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:25.320]  and now the people are finally waking up and going wait a minute a bunch of
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:30.600]  made-off criminals kin lay types are running our society
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:33.320]  right and let me tell you what people are waking up to because people have
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:36.920]  known it was criminal for a long time and the question was always what we do
[02:50:36.920 --> 02:50:41.800]  about it but they're coming to the same point i came to in 1998 which was
[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:48.440]  uh you know this thing is so perverted and is so without any
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:52.520]  uh you know it's so empty of any meaning and values
[02:50:52.520 --> 02:50:55.800]  i want nothing to do with it and i would rather be out in the wilderness i'd
[02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:59.720]  rather die in the wilderness than be part of the new world order stay there

[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:31.640]  real and they're seeing that it's predatory

[02:54:44.680 --> 02:54:47.560]  that's what these people out there that support world government the useful
[02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:51.560]  idiots don't understand and powerful words from kathar
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:55.480]  austin fits at the end of that segment saying i'd rather die
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:58.200]  than be in the new world order i wanted her to be able to
[02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:02.040]  finish that statement and then continue through this segment in the next
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.280]  i'll go ahead katharine well i what i was saying was i i was in the middle of
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:10.520]  litigation in washington in 1988 when i made the decision
[02:55:10.520 --> 02:55:14.280]  and alex i you know everything was corrupt you i was dealing with the
[02:55:14.280 --> 02:55:17.160]  folks from the department of justice and the courts and
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:21.400]  my own attorneys and it just you know it just went on and on and on and on and
[02:55:21.400 --> 02:55:25.960]  there was at one point i finally realized these people don't believe in the law
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:29.720]  of any kind you know that they just uh
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:33.240]  they're is what Leonard Cohen said they're blinded by the beauty of their
[02:55:33.240 --> 02:55:37.720]  weapons and ultimately an economy and a civilization
[02:55:37.720 --> 02:55:41.400]  can't be based on force and greed that's not enough to keep
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:44.680]  something going and you know if you if you look at the
[02:55:44.680 --> 02:55:48.040]  great empires throughout history they had something more than
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:54.040]  than simply guns and and greed and so uh you know and i remember saying look we
[02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:58.120]  need another plan this is not going to work and i would
[02:55:58.120 --> 02:56:01.160]  rather be dead than be part of it because it's too perverted
[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:05.560]  i mean it's just if you if you look at the sexual practices if you look at the
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:09.240]  cultural practices it's it's just too perverted now
[02:56:09.240 --> 02:56:13.240]  let me speak in defense of some of the top guys what they say is
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:16.440]  the crowd always goes through the criminals you know you know the story
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:20.040]  of the crucifixion you're talking about Jesus and the money changer you know
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:25.080]  Jesus gets gets hauled off by the uh the Romans that the
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:28.680]  request the priest give us Barabbas right and
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:33.080]  and the Romans know it's very bad karma to kill Jesus so they offer the crowd
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.400]  the option of the criminal or Jesus and and the crowd lets the criminal off and
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:40.760]  and if you look throughout history what the guys at the top will say look
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:44.680]  the crowd is easy to manipulate the guy that will buy them with their own money
[02:56:44.680 --> 02:56:48.120]  always wins and so that's what i was about to say
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:52.440]  i've had high level elitist openly tell me over the years look Alex this is the
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:56.520]  way the world is you might as well join it and try to do some good in the evil
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:56:59.320]  system because this is just the way it is but
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:03.560]  once you have that attitude it just races downhill into Nazi Germany
[02:57:03.560 --> 02:57:08.040]  right and that's the problem and and suddenly it's funny i gave a
[02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:12.440]  presentation in London um many years ago about sort of what was happening in
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:15.800]  this country and there was a guy who i'm pretty sure
[02:57:15.800 --> 02:57:19.800]  they had sort of sent over to discredit me after i spoke
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:23.320]  and i gave a paper called the myth of the rule of law which is quite good and it
[02:57:23.320 --> 02:57:26.600]  was quite fair and everything and and this guy just turned
[02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:29.640]  redder and redder as he was listening to me speak and finally when it was over
[02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:35.320]  he just burst out and he said you don't understand he said he said we can't we
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:39.080]  can't we can't depend on people to be responsible so
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:43.240]  uh you know so so we just can't depend on them be responsible and i turned to him
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:47.000]  and i said so that's why you destroy all the people who are
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:50.920]  and because really what the you know all this has been used to justify just
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:53.720]  taking and theft and bad behavior on their part
[02:57:53.720 --> 02:57:57.400]  and Alex he jumped up and walked out of the conference and never came back so i
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:00.920]  guess he figured he couldn't discredit me and was instead deeply
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:03.880]  disturbed but but there is a chicken and egg problem
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:07.160]  and that's why i believe that significant efforts
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:11.480]  in the grassroots to shift this thing can shift it because there's so many
[02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:14.600]  people who work in government and corporations
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:18.440]  and large organizations who don't want it to go to this they don't want a slavery
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.200]  system yeah people who have children and and people who love
[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:26.280]  humanity i mean i've i've seen so many people who've been abused
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:30.120]  who then become abusers it's like well i've been cheated so i'm going to cheat
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:33.960]  somebody else but then when i get cheated i fight to stop others from
[02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:37.560]  being cheated i mean it's it's it's there's just so many twisted people
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:42.760]  out there we'll be back final segment with our guests

[03:00:21.640 --> 03:00:26.440]  uh katherine there's this article in the london guardian today new global f at
[03:00:26.440 --> 03:00:30.440]  tax to rein in banks and they say it's a v at on all
[03:00:30.440 --> 03:00:34.040]  transactions and the nations are all passing laws to comply
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:37.960]  gordon brown says it's a global governance and the top banks will now
[03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:41.800]  put taxes on all other financial transactions and give themselves the
[03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:45.000]  money and they're billing it all over the news
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:49.400]  as a way to get the rich bankers i mean they really are slick
[03:00:49.400 --> 03:00:53.320]  how they pass all their different takeover operations in the name of
[03:00:53.320 --> 03:00:57.160]  getting the rich guys i mean they are really duplicitous but i guess they've
[03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:01.320]  got the guardian and the ap and others working for them the matrix is
[03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:05.160]  trillions of dollars are spent on on getting the matrix to look
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:12.360]  you know disney world has taught these guys a lot
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:15.560]  so you know but there's a great amount of money made to
[03:01:15.560 --> 03:01:21.160]  to make the system look um legitimate you know up to and including the lawsuit
[03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:25.320]  against goldman fact oh yeah i wanted to ask you about that we're
[03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:28.360]  almost out of time i believe it's because there's so much
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:31.880]  heat it's civil they can now have a three four year investigation give
[03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:35.480]  somebody a five million dollar fine slap somebody on the wrist and use the
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:38.760]  investigation to smoke screen all the state investigations
[03:01:38.760 --> 03:01:42.360]  well i think it's complex i think there are multiple agendas going on
[03:01:42.360 --> 03:01:46.440]  but there's no doubt about it i think the reason this one got through is
[03:01:46.440 --> 03:01:51.000]  is these latest polls that show ron paul even with obama or the tea party
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:55.800]  representing american most american people more than either political party
[03:01:55.800 --> 03:02:00.600]  i think washington is in real trouble and and washington is trying to
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:04.360]  say no no no this wasn't us this was wall street which is clearly a bunch of
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:08.520]  bunk but coming into the election washington has a real problem
[03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:11.560]  the democrats have a real problem because if you look at the
[03:02:11.560 --> 03:02:14.520]  the derivative you know glass beagle and derivatives it was all ruben and
[03:02:14.520 --> 03:02:17.960]  clinton and we see literally clinton in testimony
[03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:22.280]  you know this last week saying oh i was wrong to listen to rumen and summers
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:25.960]  you know he can't hint the goldman guy
[03:02:25.960 --> 03:02:30.280]  so so you've got really i call it the midnight thing after the story in the
[03:02:30.280 --> 03:02:33.720]  old testament of the midnight taking over israel and they
[03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:37.240]  they getting the army attacks and the midnight jump up in the dark and kill
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:40.360]  each other and we're literally watching the midnight kill each
[03:02:40.360 --> 03:02:43.480]  other now as they start looking for scapegoats coming in the election so
[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:46.840]  you're saying it's so bad for them they may even throw a few of their minions
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:49.560]  overboard oh they're going to throw a lot and that's
[03:02:49.560 --> 03:02:52.520]  the opportunity if you if you make a deck of cards
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:56.600]  i want you to make a deck of cards that are basically the 50
[03:02:56.600 --> 03:03:00.280]  most ridiculous people in the new world order and make fun of them because the
[03:03:00.280 --> 03:03:04.840]  more we make the ones you're going to get shot at the ones we make fun of
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:08.600]  that they have excess capacity so what you're going to watch is they're going
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:12.200]  to start turning against each other yeah because really they're all a bunch of
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:16.200]  hateful creatures anyways any excuse to well i throw him over i'll move up the
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:19.320]  pyramid right there's no loyalty among rats and that
[03:03:19.320 --> 03:03:22.520]  and that is our opportunity if we can be part of something
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:25.800]  and that's what i said before there are so many wonderful people
[03:03:25.800 --> 03:03:29.160]  who are working in government are working in large corporations are working
[03:03:29.160 --> 03:03:31.800]  in state local government that are looking at what
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:35.480]  what is going on they're absolutely appalled and they need
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:39.720]  you know they need uh more and more of us offering something which is
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:44.200]  constitutional which is absolutely which is wealth building to
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:47.000]  attract them into we've only got one minute left
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:50.040]  do you agree with me that they're setting a stage for false flag terror to be
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:51.960]  blamed on tea parties i mean they're really
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:55.240]  really beating the drum right now they're trying so hard
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:58.920]  and the harder they try the more ridiculous they look and so
[03:03:58.920 --> 03:04:02.360]  they're going to keep trying it's going to fail completely and
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:06.040]  i hope they just keep talking that way because the more they talk that way the
[03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:09.560]  funnier they look it is getting ridiculous
[03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:12.680]  it is getting ridiculous when you say you don't like the banks looting you
[03:04:12.680 --> 03:04:16.360]  you hate black people you want to blow up federal buildings
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:20.680]  it's not working it's not working so i hope they keep doing it because
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:26.040]  what the reason ron paul is pulled you know is pulled into uh
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:29.480]  you know is is head to head now with obama is because of these tactics and
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:33.720]  how they're failing people are smart alex it is amazing how little
[03:04:33.720 --> 03:04:37.960]  violence you see across this country it is amazing because people have
[03:04:37.960 --> 03:04:42.200]  learned that will be used the wrong way and so that
[03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:45.560]  the you know people are really smart about how they are
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:49.480]  exercising their disobedience to the new world order so
[03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:53.080]  you know we're for law we're for wealth and they're against it and
[03:04:53.080 --> 03:04:56.760]  absolutely katherine we're out of time incredible interview
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:04:59.880]  thank you for spending time with us god bless you alex you're the best
[03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:04.040]  you're the best one major world crisis away from having
[03:05:04.040 --> 03:05:07.480]  a totalitarian type of system the main event is the

[03:11:29.240 --> 03:11:32.760]  patriot act and substituted it for the other one and then our congressman
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:37.240]  voted on an act that said nobody'd ever read and you know what did it do
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:41.000]  look what it does if you buy a direct violation of the constitution
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.080]  and a number of areas the freedom of speech a new process
[03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:50.440]  uh and uh and then it just goes on and on and on that's what it's all about
[03:11:50.440 --> 03:11:53.000]  all right this terrorist movement in this country today
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:57.480]  is uh is government uh coordinated the covert the covert
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:00.600]  so i the i call it the criminal government
[03:12:00.600 --> 03:12:04.760]  that enterprise is behind this whole thing the shadow government
[03:12:04.760 --> 03:12:08.760]  the the not things as you say there's no question about it the spiritual war
[03:12:08.760 --> 03:12:14.200]  it's up to them to say panic activity and the pedophilia and freeing the
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:17.400]  congressman's senators in the Nebraska case which i worked with former
[03:12:17.400 --> 03:12:22.760]  senator john decamp and on and on and on oklahoma city uh it was the inside
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:27.240]  job 911's inside job uh the world trade center car bombing
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:32.200]  february 26 1993 the fbi was not only involved in that they knew but in
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:34.680]  advance this is in the new york times up till
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:40.600]  28 1993 by the way they knew in advance the fbi did i brought the
[03:12:40.600 --> 03:12:44.840]  bombing and they had an informant with the group and he was told to put their
[03:12:44.840 --> 03:12:47.560]  bomb together he went to his fbi superiors
[03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:50.840]  and uh he said we're going to use a dummy bomb aren't we in this very fbi
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:53.720]  superiors said no we're going to use a real bomb so the fbi
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:56.840]  knowing in advance that they were going to bomb the world trade center car bomb
[03:12:56.840 --> 03:12:59.480]  in 1993 they furnishing fees for the bomb now
[03:12:59.480 --> 03:13:02.360]  what more evidence do you want then that came out during the trial
[03:13:02.360 --> 03:13:06.200]  because the informant the fbi informer wore a body mark on mike when he met
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:08.920]  with the cherish and i knew that the fbi wore a body
[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:11.560]  mike when he went with the fbi and that's what probably
[03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:15.720]  expected yeah that was a mod salon i mean he he knew
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:20.440]  he knew that they were setting him up and so he went in and said look you're
[03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:24.120]  you're saying go ahead with the bombing you you did this why are you doing this
[03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:27.880]  we were supposed to bust them and the fbi said no it goes forward
[03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:30.920]  now uh again we're very honored to have you uh
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:33.560]  ted and you're going 100 miles an hour which is great because you're so full
[03:13:33.560 --> 03:13:36.760]  of information everything he's saying is backed up and documented
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:40.920]  for my own research but let's go back now and be sure and back off that phone
[03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:45.160]  for me uh let's go back to your awakening in the
[03:13:45.160 --> 03:13:49.080]  fbi what you saw with co until pro what it is
[03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:52.920]  and how you see them trying to now frame
[03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:56.760]  the tea parties how they're prepping the public in the media
[03:13:56.760 --> 03:14:00.600]  for terror attacks to discredit people that are trying to stop the new world
[03:14:00.600 --> 03:14:04.200]  order well uh i was very active in the coin
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:07.720]  shop program uh particularly the back dancers back in
[03:14:07.720 --> 03:14:12.440]  1960 through the vietnam war um you know we used it against them and it was
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:15.080]  very effective and it's very effective today and they're using it
[03:14:15.080 --> 03:14:18.200]  today but what they're doing today makes uh
[03:14:18.200 --> 03:14:22.920]  makes the the uh old coin shop program by the fbi back in the 60s
[03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:25.640]  looked like a study school class these guys today are
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:29.960]  unbelievable i'm being there for brazen they're violating the law they're
[03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:33.560]  coming out and they're trying to set people up i'm i'm a perfect example of
[03:14:33.560 --> 03:14:37.720]  they try to set me up in 1982 with a drug deal with a girl named band
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:41.400]  boston she came over to my side and told me that they were trying to set me up
[03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:44.920]  and i took i gave her a polygraph examination
[03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:49.400]  and uh she passed it and uh and i sent uh i took a sign statement i sent it back
[03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:53.160]  to washington and uh i mean that was i might have
[03:14:53.160 --> 03:14:56.920]  kind of it was uh you know short of that unbelievable
[03:14:56.920 --> 03:15:01.000]  activity on their part just trying to set me up on the drug operation i knew
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:05.240]  all they want to do is just discredit me well tell people what co and tell pro
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:08.680]  tell people what co and tell pro is and when you were involved in it
[03:15:08.680 --> 03:15:13.160]  uh you as you said that was light compared to what's going on now what it is
[03:15:13.160 --> 03:15:18.200]  well what a good point to a pro program is a disinformation major disinformation
[03:15:18.200 --> 03:15:21.880]  program uh and i'll give you an example on the black dancers
[03:15:21.880 --> 03:15:25.880]  back in the 60s uh we sent an anonymous letter to the
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:28.920]  secretary treasurer uh the black dancers uh probably
[03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:33.080]  there in new Haven, Connecticut and told him that uh
[03:15:33.080 --> 03:15:36.040]  that the chairman of the black dancers party was having an affair with his
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:39.400]  wife we sent a letter at the same time to the chairman
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:43.320]  told him that the secretary treasurer was stealing money from the panthers
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:47.080]  and it caused disruption within the ranks and it causes the dissension among
[03:15:47.080 --> 03:15:51.000]  the the troops so that's you know that's just an example of it
[03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:54.360]  but and that's the kind of stuff i go through just just and i know you've
[03:15:54.360 --> 03:15:58.840]  gone through it just constant lies constant stories just throwing as much
[03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:03.560]  garbage as they can at anybody that's actually getting something done
[03:16:03.560 --> 03:16:06.360]  that's right that's right and that and they've done that to me i mean if you're
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:10.520]  going the internet you see people like stew lab who was an FBI informant
[03:16:10.520 --> 03:16:16.280]  right he took i took him in how the house didn't close him for seven months
[03:16:16.280 --> 03:16:20.520]  leaving a car but with gasoline and a body actually bought him a suit
[03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:23.880]  he had no place to go he was looking for a place to stay for four days i took him
[03:16:23.880 --> 03:16:28.440]  in he stayed for seven months and ended up being an FBI informant against me
[03:16:28.440 --> 03:16:33.800]  and uh he he stole from me he stole all kinds of material and research from me
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:37.480]  and then he goes out now and he goes on the internet this guy stew lab
[03:16:37.480 --> 03:16:42.200]  and he tells the people that i'm a uh oh i was practicing i'm a practicing
[03:16:42.200 --> 03:16:45.400]  statement that i was picked out of the FBI for practicing defending
[03:16:45.400 --> 03:16:49.160]  family in the federal building enough kind of junk well i don't even really
[03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:51.800]  know that guy but i mean i i mean the issue is
[03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:55.800]  they call my wife up on unlisted numbers and tell her
[03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:58.600]  well her and i've been talking about on the phone
[03:16:58.600 --> 03:17:02.920]  and then and then women call up saying i've gotten her uh them pregnant so it's
[03:17:02.920 --> 03:17:07.000]  just standard stuff uh going on but but but but you're
[03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:10.120]  saying today it's much worse what do you see them doing
[03:17:10.120 --> 03:17:13.320]  with the tea party because it's every news channel is saying
[03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:17.080]  we're all racist clan members and we're going to blow federal buildings up
[03:17:17.080 --> 03:17:20.440]  the news is all saying i'm calling for violence when i'm calling for the
[03:17:20.440 --> 03:17:23.720]  opposite uh break that down
[03:17:23.720 --> 03:17:26.680]  well what they're doing is they've infiltrated
[03:17:26.680 --> 03:17:30.920]  every uh group in america they've got they've got their own people in there
[03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:34.280]  their own informants their own provocateurs in there and they're
[03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:37.080]  going to stir up screw them up they're going to come up with the idea there
[03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:40.520]  their provocateurs are going to come up with the idea of doing some violent acts
[03:17:40.520 --> 03:17:43.640]  and then try to set up set up the tea party itself
[03:17:43.640 --> 03:17:47.480]  uh for these violent acts and then of course that's when the FBI will come in
[03:17:47.480 --> 03:17:50.680]  and arrest everybody and uh they'll let that their people go
[03:17:50.680 --> 03:17:53.960]  all the people that set it up they'll be pretending like the prosecution
[03:17:53.960 --> 03:17:58.520]  they'll just disappear out the back door and uh that'll be it
[03:17:58.520 --> 03:18:02.040]  well that's like that's like hitari uh up in michigan
[03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:06.440]  they're now saying that their fbi agent and informant were part of the nine
[03:18:06.440 --> 03:18:09.640]  member group but they still arrested all of them
[03:18:09.640 --> 03:18:12.440]  but some of them are being held at other facilities so we'll see them be
[03:18:12.440 --> 03:18:16.280]  released out the back door later absolutely they'll be able to release
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:19.400]  their own people and then they'll go along another part of the country
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:22.920]  and work in with another group under another name and start over again
[03:18:22.920 --> 03:18:27.080]  absolutely that's exactly what's happening well they've even caught the
[03:18:27.080 --> 03:18:30.200]  democrats telling people to go out and dress like
[03:18:30.200 --> 03:18:34.120]  nazis and go to tea parties but uh more and more of this is coming
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:37.960]  out i mean do you think the new world order is in trouble
[03:18:37.960 --> 03:18:41.960]  well uh i hope that they're in trouble
[03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:45.720]  uh you know because their people are waking up
[03:18:45.720 --> 03:18:49.080]  and when i started talking about this like 30 years ago i got out of the FBI
[03:18:49.080 --> 03:18:52.360]  in 1979 when i started talking about this 30 years
[03:18:52.360 --> 03:18:55.320]  ago and i came up with it and went public with it people thought i was a
[03:18:55.320 --> 03:18:59.720]  pook i was nuts i was conspiracy theorist uh but now people are saying
[03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:03.480]  you know uh looking back you're right and people are saying that to me on
[03:19:03.480 --> 03:19:07.480]  on almost a daily basis so i think people are waking up to what's
[03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:10.040]  going on thanks to shows like this alex by the way

[03:24:21.400 --> 03:24:25.960]  right now long segment coming up from your fbi training from your research a
[03:24:25.960 --> 03:24:28.520]  lot of your predictions you made over the decades
[03:24:28.520 --> 03:24:32.360]  unfortunately came true how do you see the feds
[03:24:32.360 --> 03:24:36.040]  and the globalist from from their pre-programming on the news because he
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:38.920]  always pre-program I know you've been watching it because we talked before he
[03:24:38.920 --> 03:24:42.840]  went on air what type of attacks should we look out for to
[03:24:42.840 --> 03:24:46.760]  demonize the patriot movement well uh...
[03:24:46.760 --> 03:24:49.560]  first of all they're they're they're going to make all kinds of wild
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:53.400]  allegations like we mentioned to web uh... being at the end of the week
[03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:56.680]  said i was practicing organic ceremonies at federal belly which is
[03:24:56.680 --> 03:25:00.120]  the reason i was dismissed from the fbi which is not true
[03:25:00.120 --> 03:25:03.320]  uh... they're going to resolve kind of disinformation like that against each
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:05.720]  one of us like i think they've accused you of being
[03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:10.680]  involved in potter or something else uh... alex and a lot of crazy stuff
[03:25:10.680 --> 03:25:15.240]  and uh... so they're going to use those tactics and then they are going to use
[03:25:15.240 --> 03:25:19.080]  their own infield traders into the various groups there was a supervisor fbi
[03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:23.400]  supervisor at albuquerque made a statement uh... publicly that uh...
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:27.880]  that the fbi infiltrated every patriot movement in the country well they have
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:31.160]  they got their informants out there i know because back in the late sixties
[03:25:31.160 --> 03:25:34.680]  when i was active in the uh... against the black panthers
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:38.200]  uh... we were as we were in and also the communist party
[03:25:38.200 --> 03:25:42.040]  we had members and people there were informants for us
[03:25:42.040 --> 03:25:46.040]  within every group and in America so they can go in there and disrupt the
[03:25:46.040 --> 03:25:50.360]  operation uh... make plans for a terrorist act of some sort
[03:25:50.360 --> 03:25:54.600]  then blame it on the infield traders uh... and so forth
[03:25:54.600 --> 03:25:57.800]  so it goes on and on and on it's a vicious circle
[03:25:57.800 --> 03:26:01.160]  and you know like for example you mentioned the children that were
[03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:04.840]  uh... that would be and we've worked with johnnie camp on this case in
[03:26:04.840 --> 03:26:08.520]  nebraska back in the eighties late eighties early nineties where they were
[03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:11.400]  flying children out of uh... Omaha nebraska
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:14.920]  uh... they're actually are driving in the city of 184 miles away putting them
[03:26:14.920 --> 03:26:18.200]  in private jet flying to the washington dc for sexual use of congressman's
[03:26:18.200 --> 03:26:21.960]  centers well then resty nilson the fisher photographer who i
[03:26:21.960 --> 03:26:24.840]  interviewed by the way and have i have him on tape
[03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:28.280]  uh... with uh... would take pictures and then the black meal at congressman's
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:31.560]  centers tell them how to vote and that's what's happening in america today
[03:26:31.560 --> 03:26:35.880]  and uh... we don't have enough people i could finish and run for standing up
[03:26:35.880 --> 03:26:39.240]  uh... and the other people have all been from many of them blackmailed to
[03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:42.040]  children through sex with two drugs and one have yet
[03:26:42.040 --> 03:26:45.080]  and of course they're only interested in being reelected
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:50.920]  it is for the most part so so from your research i mean what percentage how does
[03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:53.960]  the power structure work is it a mixture of pedophiles
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:58.760]  satanist occultist uh... because i mean every time i was never
[03:26:58.760 --> 03:27:02.920]  expecting to find this every time i do research we run into satanism
[03:27:02.920 --> 03:27:06.680]  pedophilia uh... devil worship occultism
[03:27:06.680 --> 03:27:09.880]  i mean it's it's really just a bunch of lunatics
[03:27:09.880 --> 03:27:12.760]  you know absolutely but they're well organized
[03:27:12.760 --> 03:27:16.600]  and uh... the passion we we're dealing with a bunch of nazi
[03:27:16.600 --> 03:27:20.760]  of fascist uh... uh... uh... evil people
[03:27:20.760 --> 03:27:24.040]  and uh... they are lunatics but they're well organized they know what they're
[03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:27.080]  doing uh... they have a master plan is called the
[03:27:27.080 --> 03:27:30.680]  Illuminati and we're in a spiritual war is that a spiritual war
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:36.200]  all the way and uh... so people need to wake up to what's actually going on by
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:37.000]  the way
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:40.520]  alex i have a uh... i have uh... fifty two percent sorry

[03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:04.520]  obama says the number one threat is nukes going off
[03:35:04.520 --> 03:35:08.440]  and what you know about suitcase nukes ted gunnerson
[03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:13.160]  well uh... you know when oklahoma city occurred uh... i had a call from mike
[03:35:13.160 --> 03:35:16.760]  for connoisseur i mentioned mike's name a few moments ago
[03:35:16.760 --> 03:35:20.840]  mike told me that the oklahoma city bombing
[03:35:20.840 --> 03:35:24.360]  the uh... it was not a fertilizer bomb it was his uh...
[03:35:24.360 --> 03:35:28.120]  his bomb that he developed when he was with the cia for 20 years
[03:35:28.120 --> 03:35:31.480]  and it's called the electrohydrodynamic gaseous fuel device
[03:35:31.480 --> 03:35:34.840]  anybody with any sense knows anything about fertilizer bombs
[03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:37.640]  uh... you don't even know anything about it but you you know that they
[03:35:37.640 --> 03:35:40.680]  feel like the bomb did not destroy half of that building which is what they
[03:35:40.680 --> 03:35:44.600]  claimed in oklahoma city so mike called and told me this and so i started
[03:35:44.600 --> 03:35:48.280]  researching it and i found out and learned of the uh...
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:52.200]  it's uh... i'll call it a barometric bomb this bomb was actually developed
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:56.600]  back in the 1980s under the ronnie reagan administration
[03:35:56.600 --> 03:36:00.440]  and that the night that it was tested in area 51 i was with the group of people
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:04.280]  in palm springs waiting for the results it was so powerful they underestimated
[03:36:04.280 --> 03:36:07.160]  the strength that was so powerful that one of the scientists died
[03:36:07.160 --> 03:36:12.440]  and the two others were injured and uh... and and then it was highly classified
[03:36:12.440 --> 03:36:15.080]  and inside the classified still is to this day
[03:36:15.080 --> 03:36:19.560]  and reagan put a high classification on it the top secret not to be developed
[03:36:19.560 --> 03:36:23.080]  or to furnish to anybody any other sources and so on and so forth
[03:36:23.080 --> 03:36:26.680]  and this was actually the bomb that was used in oklahoma city now my research
[03:36:26.680 --> 03:36:32.280]  didn't stop there i found out the contract number for this bomb
[03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:35.400]  it was developed by hercules manufacturing which was microcontact
[03:36:35.400 --> 03:36:38.040]  to this company he actually developed the bomb
[03:36:38.040 --> 03:36:41.800]  and it was manufactured by dine in no bail out of salt lake city
[03:36:41.800 --> 03:36:46.040]  i wrote to picatinny arsenal in new jersey and with the contract number
[03:36:46.040 --> 03:36:49.080]  and said i want to copy the contract this is public source information by the
[03:36:49.080 --> 03:36:52.200]  way and they came back and said there's no
[03:36:52.200 --> 03:36:57.240]  uh... contract in our record and so that was not right live because i had
[03:36:57.240 --> 03:37:00.120]  that i had to actually had the contract number itself
[03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:03.400]  uh... and so there's there's the rate that they're right now
[03:37:03.400 --> 03:37:07.880]  in june of nineteen ninety five right after the bombing
[03:37:07.880 --> 03:37:10.840]  bill clinton gave a speech in handover new hampshire
[03:37:10.840 --> 03:37:14.040]  and he said that the bomb and used in oklahoma city
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:17.400]  was a miracle of technology you know you the government's in the meantime is
[03:37:17.400 --> 03:37:20.840]  telling us that the fertilizer bomb was used in oklahoma city and now
[03:37:20.840 --> 03:37:23.080]  clinton comes out and says it was a miracle of
[03:37:23.080 --> 03:37:27.400]  technology this is all well documented in the american pre-press by the way
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:31.000]  so uh... you have a major major cover-up i made
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:34.440]  two trips to oklahoma city out of my pocket
[03:37:34.440 --> 03:37:37.800]  and uh... and then checked into this like this case
[03:37:37.800 --> 03:37:41.000]  and there's absolutely no question about it it was like it was a government
[03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:43.640]  operation uh... the meantime kerry nick was one of the
[03:37:43.640 --> 03:37:47.640]  co-dependent in the case as well and after david with the u.s.
[03:37:47.640 --> 03:37:51.720]  district court in salt lake city that larry pot number two men and yet the
[03:37:51.720 --> 03:37:53.960]  at the time was the person who orchestrated
[03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:58.360]  bill of the oklahoma city bombing and then mcvey was working for black ops and
[03:37:58.360 --> 03:38:02.120]  we had jane gramm on yesterday who was on the ninth floor
[03:38:02.120 --> 03:38:04.600]  and she said she saw mcvey going up and down the
[03:38:04.600 --> 03:38:07.480]  elevators she saw guys with gray sticks of butter
[03:38:07.480 --> 03:38:11.960]  and and and and wiring and uh... we know police officers said they saw the same
[03:38:11.960 --> 03:38:14.200]  thing like taryn's yakey then he basically got
[03:38:14.200 --> 03:38:18.440]  you know killed uh... all of this all of this going on
[03:38:18.440 --> 03:38:22.840]  and you have the building blown out not in and you've got uh... at the same time
[03:38:22.840 --> 03:38:25.240]  clinton's saying it's going to happen again
[03:38:25.240 --> 03:38:28.520]  and and and uh... but not even a veiled threat saying it's going to be blamed on
[03:38:28.520 --> 03:38:30.360]  the tea parties
[03:38:30.360 --> 03:38:30.960]  right
[03:38:30.960 --> 03:38:32.200]  that's right
[03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:36.280]  at all at all or not at all more part master plan in order to uh... comes
[03:38:36.280 --> 03:38:37.000]  into
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:38.400]  because martial law
[03:38:38.400 --> 03:38:40.840]  we know that they've got bill of things uh...
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:43.960]  that are on the police thirty-five bill of things in in uh... i think they're in
[03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:45.320]  Atlanta right now
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:49.080]  we have a coffin that are a stockpiled in a and in a georgia
[03:38:49.080 --> 03:38:54.240]  that just happened in nineteen ninety-five the state legislature in georgia
[03:38:54.240 --> 03:38:56.000]  passed a law they would allow
[03:38:56.000 --> 03:38:59.280]  inmates who were given the life of their death sentence
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:03.520]  to be extolled executed by uh... by uh...
[03:39:03.520 --> 03:39:07.120]  but but by that by guillotine that's right more than a decade ago you said
[03:39:07.120 --> 03:39:11.200]  they were stockpiling plastic coffins everywhere and now they're on the news
[03:39:11.200 --> 03:39:13.840]  and they admit they're stockpiling them everywhere
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:15.640]  that's right that's right
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:18.080]  and and uh... and they uh...
[03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:20.800]  you know that uh... they have a georgia
[03:39:20.800 --> 03:39:22.880]  nineteen ninety-five passed this law
[03:39:22.880 --> 03:39:24.240]  which allowed them to bring
[03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:27.800]  guillotines and and also caught coffins in the georgia
[03:39:27.800 --> 03:39:32.120]  uh... as an excuse now that they've prepped the anticipation of doing this
[03:39:32.120 --> 03:39:33.860]  on a national base i believe
[03:39:33.860 --> 03:39:36.640]  and uh... absolutely no question about it
[03:39:36.640 --> 03:39:41.000]  and uh... so you know that it goes on and on and on by the way i want my
[03:39:41.000 --> 03:39:45.760]  mention this also in the fireman's magazine september nineteen ninety-five
[03:39:45.760 --> 03:39:50.160]  the editor wrote an article about Oklahoma City and the information he obtained
[03:39:50.160 --> 03:39:53.800]  for the article came from the Oklahoma City Fire Department
[03:39:53.800 --> 03:39:55.920]  and in that article it says that
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:39:58.800]  four different conventional bombs
[03:39:58.800 --> 03:40:02.520]  were removed from that building from Oklahoma City to the uh... murray building
[03:40:02.520 --> 03:40:03.960]  Oklahoma City four
[03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:05.920]  conventional bombs were removed
[03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:09.680]  so i think that what happened is that the barometric bomb went off
[03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:13.680]  and uh... it was to be followed by four other bombs that were completely
[03:40:13.680 --> 03:40:14.800]  destroyed
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:18.000]  that building but if they did it for some reason rather the other four bombs
[03:40:18.000 --> 03:40:19.960]  did not go off if they had to remove them
[03:40:19.960 --> 03:40:23.880]  and they stopped the rescue process for like five hours while they ran in there
[03:40:23.880 --> 03:40:26.880]  and brought a bunch of files out of Oklahoma City
[03:40:26.880 --> 03:40:28.240]  uh... and uh...
[03:40:28.240 --> 03:40:31.960]  because we know about Terence Yeagy that said that he committed suicide
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:34.440]  uh... well i mean that's pretty tough to do
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:38.360]  uh... because he had thirteen uh... thirteen by the way
[03:40:38.360 --> 03:40:41.240]  uh... injuries to him and including his uh...
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:43.240]  uh... his arms
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:45.760]  and uh... i think on his neck
[03:40:45.760 --> 03:40:48.400]  and uh... of course he was shot and uh...
[03:40:48.400 --> 03:40:52.400]  there's blood in his car and his body was like a death because they got a mile off the
[03:40:52.400 --> 03:40:54.040]  high or something along the way
[03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:55.880]  so it could distance off the highway
[03:40:55.880 --> 03:40:59.440]  so uh... you know that's all part of the cover up. Yeagy had
[03:40:59.440 --> 03:41:01.600]  I talked to his wife at one time
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:03.480]  and he had a video
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:07.840]  and he was a video buff and he had a video camera right there
[03:41:07.840 --> 03:41:11.640]  at the time of the Oklahoma City bombing and he came over and started taking pictures
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:14.960]  with his video and they wanted that but you were a load of boys wanted
[03:41:14.960 --> 03:41:17.200]  those pictures uh... from his camera
[03:41:17.200 --> 03:41:18.880]  uh... in order to uh...
[03:41:18.880 --> 03:41:22.920]  to be a question that's right we've interviewed uh... colonel Craig Roberts
[03:41:22.920 --> 03:41:25.600]  uh... who's talked who's a police officer also
[03:41:25.600 --> 03:41:26.720]  in the area
[03:41:26.720 --> 03:41:28.320]  who talked to his partner
[03:41:28.320 --> 03:41:31.520]  and the last time Terence Yeagy cop of the year for seven almost people in the
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:32.840]  building was heard from
[03:41:32.840 --> 03:41:35.480]  he was going to a secret storage facility
[03:41:35.480 --> 03:41:37.240]  outside the police department
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:39.840]  out in the country where he had these materials
[03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:42.240]  and he said i'm being followed by feds
[03:41:42.240 --> 03:41:44.960]  and then they found his body he'd been tortured to death
[03:41:44.960 --> 03:41:48.920]  trying to find out where that video was we had all those other video cameras
[03:41:48.920 --> 03:41:51.320]  from the local bank and the ymca
[03:41:51.320 --> 03:41:53.880]  that the government declared national security on
[03:41:53.880 --> 03:41:55.480]  and uh... wouldn't release
[03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:57.040]  uh... from the oklahoma city
[03:41:57.040 --> 03:41:58.080]  uh... bombing it
[03:41:58.080 --> 03:42:00.760]  as close as you can tell from your research
[03:42:00.760 --> 03:42:05.080]  uh... and it did come out mainstream newspapers that the fb i had of terror
[03:42:05.080 --> 03:42:09.240]  counterterrorism was there for the week before was there the day of the bombing
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:12.920]  he'd lied about that he said that he'd flown up from Dallas that day
[03:42:12.920 --> 03:42:14.440]  uh... that morning
[03:42:14.440 --> 03:42:16.280]  but it turns out he is lying
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:19.080]  uh... but but then you've got the southern poverty law center and in
[03:42:19.080 --> 03:42:23.440]  declassified documents running allaheem city you've got mcvay there you've got
[03:42:23.440 --> 03:42:25.040]  andres drossmeyer there
[03:42:25.040 --> 03:42:29.000]  you've got all these people from your research is best you can tell how was the
[03:42:29.000 --> 03:42:31.280]  operation run
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:34.440]  how is it right you say
[03:42:34.440 --> 03:42:38.760]  well what would you say i would have run i mean uh... it was uh... uh... inside
[03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:40.320]  investigator
[03:42:40.320 --> 03:42:44.240]  told me uh... investigator for the defense by the way told me the release of eleven
[03:42:44.240 --> 03:42:46.360]  other people involved in it
[03:42:46.360 --> 03:42:50.280]  story was that they took a team of people in order to pull this off
[03:42:50.280 --> 03:42:55.080]  uh... if you if you if you can't just run up the truck in with fertilizer bomb
[03:42:55.080 --> 03:42:58.960]  and and exploded and that's what jane graham said she said there were army
[03:42:58.960 --> 03:43:02.200]  guys in mcvay crawling all over the building
[03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:03.360]  that's right
[03:43:03.360 --> 03:43:04.280]  that's right
[03:43:04.280 --> 03:43:09.040]  so it was you know it was well uh... well uh... uh... plan
[03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:12.540]  and it will run it was well it could be a real professional
[03:43:12.540 --> 03:43:14.480]  these guys know what they're doing
[03:43:14.480 --> 03:43:18.160]  and uh... they but they were probably that the four conventional bomb didn't
[03:43:18.160 --> 03:43:21.680]  explode so they didn't bring all building down which was very
[03:43:21.680 --> 03:43:25.880]  that which you can get change their their overall plan to bring the building
[03:43:25.880 --> 03:43:27.160]  down but anyway
[03:43:27.160 --> 03:43:30.760]  uh... at least uh... we have the documentation in that magazine article

[03:46:40.080 --> 03:46:43.960]  which would be division five is the one that the handling this
[03:46:43.960 --> 03:46:47.600]  and uh... but they also have a by the way the committee of fascination of some
[03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:51.040]  of these other sensitive investigation
[03:46:51.040 --> 03:46:52.600]  and uh...
[03:46:52.600 --> 03:46:58.200]  that they have liaison with uh... keep people and it would be with the politicians
[03:46:58.200 --> 03:47:02.680]  and uh... they did their activity uh... it's just a sign of domestic
[03:47:02.680 --> 03:47:03.580]  intelligence
[03:47:03.580 --> 03:47:06.320]  are coordinating this with pia

[03:47:10.640 --> 03:47:14.840]  and uh... they have their own uh... nationwide of operation
[03:47:14.840 --> 03:47:16.220]  this designed uh...
[03:47:16.220 --> 03:47:18.920]  it's really a terror attack operation
[03:47:18.920 --> 03:47:23.000]  designed against the average citizen to expose us and to come after us and
[03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:26.360]  cause it raise hell and they're very very happy with us and with our
[03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:28.000]  activities and discredit us
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:31.960]  and the average fb i agent doesn't really know anything about this to the
[03:47:31.960 --> 03:47:34.300]  no absolutely not no they do not
[03:47:34.300 --> 03:47:36.360]  but the matter of fact alec uh...
[03:47:36.360 --> 03:47:38.900]  uh... i mentioned reconditioning
[03:47:38.900 --> 03:47:42.760]  but you put me to google reconditioning recondition i'm gonna spell his name
[03:47:42.760 --> 03:47:43.760]  for you
[03:47:43.760 --> 03:47:46.560]  all right c o m o s
[03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:48.560]  the i utl michael
[03:47:48.560 --> 03:47:50.320]  uh... j
[03:47:50.320 --> 03:47:53.880]  recondition all right c o m o s
[03:47:53.880 --> 03:47:57.480]  the i utl you go to michael recondition you've got a
[03:47:57.480 --> 03:48:01.560]  because you're going to find a tremendous amount of information about michael
[03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:05.960]  now michael was set up uh... and and uh... you can be prepared to testify against
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:08.800]  your department of justice in a criminal case
[03:48:08.800 --> 03:48:11.800]  and i'm not a congressional hearing accused of book committee back in the
[03:48:11.800 --> 03:48:12.960]  late late eighties
[03:48:12.960 --> 03:48:16.200]  and he was set up on a drug operation and sent into thirty years michael's
[03:48:16.200 --> 03:48:20.760]  in prison out for the alleged drug uh... allegation
[03:48:20.760 --> 03:48:22.760]  but anyway michael is uh...
[03:48:22.760 --> 03:48:25.560]  his mistake was he testified against the government
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:28.840]  and uh... so they go in after you may set him up and what have you
[03:48:28.840 --> 03:48:32.440]  now i visit michael on a regular basis michael and i've done a lot of work
[03:48:32.440 --> 03:48:34.220]  together as a matter of fact we met
[03:48:34.220 --> 03:48:37.280]  all summer been a lot back in the spring of nineteen eighty six and we were
[03:48:37.280 --> 03:48:39.120]  responsible michael and i
[03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:46.120]  but it's very serious
[03:49:00.640 --> 03:49:06.000]  the christians alliance and the capital of the roman empire in his own image
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:09.040]  this is why herston the warmongers of the emerging american empire were
[03:49:09.040 --> 03:49:12.520]  delighted by the destruction of the u.s. as main in hibana harbour in eighteen
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:13.760]  ninety eight
[03:49:13.760 --> 03:49:16.800]  it gave them the excuse they needed to rouse the public into supporting the
[03:49:16.800 --> 03:49:19.040]  spanish-american war
[03:49:19.040 --> 03:49:22.400]  this is why israel attacked the u.s. as liberty in nineteen sixty seven during
[03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:23.480]  the six-day war
[03:49:23.480 --> 03:49:27.840]  strafing and torpedoing it relentlessly for hours in vain attempt to send it to
[03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:28.960]  the bottom
[03:49:28.960 --> 03:49:32.080]  the israelis believe that the loss of the liberty could be blamed on egypt and

[03:53:31.560 --> 03:53:34.880]  well uh... i had a good back in uh... the three eighty six out of twenty
[03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:37.800]  two on company with the former top administrative
[03:53:37.800 --> 03:53:41.360]  official with the regular administration
[03:53:41.360 --> 03:53:44.760]  and that's that you have the fb and that was in the project against the story of
[03:53:44.760 --> 03:53:47.880]  the night you want to contact the micro-common said who i knew that the
[03:53:47.880 --> 03:53:49.680]  cif is for twenty years
[03:53:49.680 --> 03:53:54.640]  a scientist and uh... mike and i met in a hotel room in germanoce california
[03:53:54.640 --> 03:53:58.000]  with uh... that's the state department official and that's all city fellow
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:00.200]  with traveling under turkey passport
[03:54:00.200 --> 03:54:02.560]  and name is jim osmond
[03:54:02.560 --> 03:54:05.400]  that was the name he would use and i find out years later it was actually
[03:54:05.400 --> 03:54:06.800]  with summer bin laden
[03:54:06.800 --> 03:54:08.760]  and as a result of that meeting
[03:54:08.760 --> 03:54:12.240]  michael pernish the afghan rebels to service their message that we're able
[03:54:12.240 --> 03:54:15.720]  that he we'd be shot down that they used to shoot down so we don't copy the one
[03:54:15.720 --> 03:54:17.080]  more for them
[03:54:17.080 --> 03:54:20.200]  so all you know i've got that that of course they are also the one with our
[03:54:20.200 --> 03:54:21.200]  ally
[03:54:21.200 --> 03:54:24.280]  and then i've forced up to learn that we've furnished uh... the
[03:54:24.280 --> 03:54:27.800]  uh... the rebels uh... afghan rebels the uh...
[03:54:27.800 --> 03:54:30.840]  six hundred fifty million dollars here for five years so
[03:54:30.840 --> 03:54:33.520]  they use that money of course now to come back after us
[03:54:33.520 --> 03:54:36.520]  so you're saying you were involved in the conduit
[03:54:36.520 --> 03:54:38.240]  with the government
[03:54:38.240 --> 03:54:41.360]  uh... and i've never known you to make stuff up to that's just that that's just
[03:54:41.360 --> 03:54:42.480]  wild
[03:54:42.480 --> 03:54:46.320]  that and now how did you know he was a summer bin laden uh... or did you find
[03:54:46.320 --> 03:54:47.440]  out later
[03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:49.520]  i found out that i didn't want to have
[03:54:49.520 --> 03:54:53.200]  though i thought i knew later it was uh... it was a summer bin laden it was
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:56.160]  he was traveling under turkey passport came out
[03:54:56.160 --> 03:54:57.280]  but not at all
[03:54:57.280 --> 03:55:01.400]  well that's now been declassified that it was to my husband and yeah he had
[03:55:01.400 --> 03:55:03.200]  a shaven face and everything else
[03:55:03.200 --> 03:55:08.200]  i mean did he speak good english or what was he like
[03:55:08.200 --> 03:55:11.200]  you'd understand him i didn't think much about it i didn't realize it was a
[03:55:11.200 --> 03:55:12.680]  summer bin laden
[03:55:12.680 --> 03:55:14.920]  and uh... he was undercover
[03:55:14.920 --> 03:55:18.680]  uh... and and and i thought through the state department official years you know
[03:55:18.680 --> 03:55:21.240]  later later on in trying to get into it
[03:55:21.240 --> 03:55:24.360]  make certain admissions he said just forget about me i believe me out of the
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:26.640]  picture i don't know what i mean to do with it
[03:55:26.640 --> 03:55:28.120]  he was afraid
[03:55:28.120 --> 03:55:30.680]  which i'm not
[03:55:30.680 --> 03:55:33.680]  but anyway you know that's the story on there and that's
[03:55:33.680 --> 03:55:34.560]  if michael
[03:55:34.560 --> 03:55:37.600]  developed the source inside the earth world
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:39.800]  by furnishing these purpose there and that was that
[03:55:39.800 --> 03:55:42.000]  if you could educate it as soviet
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:45.600]  and so we had inside sources on this we had inside information
[03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:47.920]  michael did about nine one one

[03:56:09.760 --> 03:56:11.240]  very scary stuff
