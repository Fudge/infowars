[00:00.000 --> 00:18.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.600 --> 00:28.040]  so does he lie from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones ladies and
[00:28.040 --> 00:31.840]  gentlemen I got back early we got up at 5 a.m. and at the Texas border with
[00:31.840 --> 00:36.720]  Mexico and we're back in Austin for the July 1st 2021 transmission here's a
[00:36.720 --> 00:41.920]  few of the highlights of what we witnessed on the Texas Mexico border
[00:41.920 --> 00:46.520]  Trump's not suppressing this but I gotta tell you even Fox News not showing people
[00:46.520 --> 00:51.920]  that Fox News could send a team down here we've been here 30 minutes we're gonna
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.120]  upload these in chunks we're all at a band on video and many of these people have
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.640]  disappeared out of their countries many of these people are alone like this
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.360]  little boy right here barefoot and they're just disappearing there's this
[01:05.360 --> 01:10.840]  little kid that's a blonde-haired blue-eyed little boy with a Hispanic
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.040]  lady and a baby right there hundred percent not as mother did you just see
[01:16.040 --> 01:19.760]  that right there I got it I got it on the ladies and gentlemen did you just see
[01:19.760 --> 01:28.040]  what I just saw right there we need to call the police see those packets that's
[01:28.040 --> 01:31.880]  the one on the airplanes or private charter and then they're put on these
[01:31.880 --> 01:36.480]  buses and this just continues around the clock totally illegal the border
[01:36.480 --> 01:44.720]  absolutely completely over this is replacement migration right here and
[01:44.720 --> 01:52.160]  of course the global exploit the third world and then they implode the borders
[01:52.160 --> 01:56.760]  and bring the third world here to be controlled and many of these are families
[01:56.760 --> 02:00.080]  but also many of these are unaccompanied children that even the Senate's own
[02:00.080 --> 02:07.920]  report six years ago found disappeared into slavery including sex slavery now at
[02:07.920 --> 02:14.560]  least this time this is a proper vehicle for the smuggling and this is not the
[02:14.560 --> 02:21.520]  back of a trunk this is not the trunk of a car but we literally just arrived here
[02:21.520 --> 02:28.120]  three minutes ago our cameras weren't even ready and boom this facility which
[02:28.120 --> 02:34.240]  just a month ago they leased is now full of people from the door swung open and
[02:34.240 --> 02:39.760]  these people were fouled out I saw more than 50 people men women and children
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.360]  inside right now and and now they've rented buildings up and down the street
[02:44.360 --> 02:50.160]  on both sides of the street so again a lot of people when I stopped that car
[02:50.160 --> 02:52.480]  because they were illegally putting three children in the trunk they said oh it
[02:52.480 --> 02:58.880]  must be fake because it says Hollywood on this old building that I guess decades
[02:58.880 --> 03:03.400]  ago had some type of clothing store no this is a real place McAllen Texas this
[03:03.400 --> 03:08.000]  is real it's going on right here and it's it's all illegal but Biden is not
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.360]  enforcing federal law and these counties are even bucking the state
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.680]  governor Abbott who's declared an emergency here and called it state
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.240]  police from around the country to try to arrest people when they do violate the
[03:19.240 --> 03:22.680]  law like trespassing on people's property or any type of theft so here
[03:22.680 --> 03:31.480]  you go this is a emergency response team state assistant EMS support vehicle
[03:31.480 --> 03:42.160]  state placard ID what does this even mean again who are these organizations we
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.880]  need to find out about all of this we need to investigate here's another one
[03:45.880 --> 03:52.720]  pulling up to get more people now why is this important for hundreds of reasons
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.240]  when you allow this type of legal activity to go on an industrial scale it
[03:57.240 --> 04:00.680]  allows criminals to bring in drugs hit that children you name it we have video
[04:00.680 --> 04:04.440]  at the airports of the same woman day after day delivering children saying
[04:04.440 --> 04:08.400]  this is my child babies they're allowed to fly just handing them off to people
[04:08.400 --> 04:12.600]  handing them off to NGOs and then these children just disappear my sisters
[04:12.600 --> 04:16.520]  adopted it took us two years to adopt her from South Korea they had to go
[04:16.520 --> 04:20.000]  through all the background checks they had to check us out and we had to pay a
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.320]  lot of money and they had to make sure that they weren't taking a child from
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.640]  from a woman that wasn't trying to give the child up and there should be a lot
[04:27.640 --> 04:32.920]  of strictures and rules and laws of all the adoption this is again industrial
[04:32.920 --> 04:41.080]  scale taking place and again they're obviously about to load this back up and
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.600]  then leave as well again you've got these people and there's supposed
[04:45.600 --> 04:52.040]  security guard outfits this is all just outfits it's just dressing it up with
[04:52.040 --> 04:59.320]  the appearance of legality arm guards out here

[06:28.360 --> 06:33.360]  economically and using the criminal justice system defeated will be known
[06:33.360 --> 06:38.560]  as the new definition of Benedict Arnold they are the plague they are a curse
[06:38.560 --> 06:44.000]  and they are planning in my view fall flag terror attacks here in America to
[06:44.000 --> 06:48.640]  submit their rollout against us they're spoiling for a war they're spoiling for
[06:48.640 --> 06:53.800]  a coup they're spoiling to overthrow and they're getting ready to carry out
[06:53.800 --> 06:57.880]  terror attacks that is their handlers are to be blamed on those of us they're
[06:57.880 --> 07:01.560]  loyal Americans in our opposition to the destruction of the country and the sell
[07:01.560 --> 07:04.920]  out of the nation and they're all over television saying Trump question the
[07:04.920 --> 07:09.160]  election is an act of terror and he's got to be dealt with by the military
[07:09.160 --> 07:12.440]  government's gonna kill this guy and they're on channel saying we need to get
[07:12.440 --> 07:16.120]  members of Congress using the military people sitting in Congress right now
[07:16.120 --> 07:20.880]  people in and around the former president and then general Millie and
[07:20.880 --> 07:25.280]  general Austin and general on array get up there and click their heels and say
[07:25.280 --> 07:30.160]  we want to slug out with the American people and every white person that
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.560]  doesn't salute us is a white supremacist enemy and we're the Americans and
[07:34.560 --> 07:38.720]  they're Hitler and we're gonna get ready for war
[07:38.720 --> 07:45.320]  turn us loose we're gonna get America death to America says Millie death to
[07:45.320 --> 07:55.320]  America says Austin death to America says on array it's July 1st 2021
[08:03.240 --> 08:08.200]  to chronicle the treason in anti-American activities of general
[08:08.200 --> 08:16.000]  on array Austin and Millie it would take years let us examine only one small data point the
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  gun confiscation that took place after the Katrina hurricane where peaceful
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.560]  people high and dry under the orders of on array had their firearms stolen and
[08:27.560 --> 08:32.520]  taken from them never to be returned the police and National Guard going street
[08:32.520 --> 08:39.000]  by street house to house sometimes entering open houses with guns drawn
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.480]  instructions to disarm anyone inside you say guns guns will be taken no one
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.720]  will be able to be on yes take all weapons and now on array is organizing
[08:48.720 --> 08:54.040]  the national response for the Democratic Party for gun confiscation that
[08:54.040 --> 08:57.320]  happened today in this wealthy neighborhood where homeowners had armed
[08:57.320 --> 09:02.600]  themselves to protect their mansions residents were handcuffed on the ground
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.240]  in the end police took their weapons but let them stay in their homes for many
[09:07.240 --> 09:10.760]  of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an
[09:10.760 --> 09:16.960]  American city this guard unit occupied a church using it as a base camp all of
[09:16.960 --> 09:22.800]  a sudden they were banging on the front door the side door and the back door
[09:22.800 --> 09:30.600]  and they said let us in I said it's not even loaded I really thought they were
[09:30.600 --> 09:35.400]  gonna kill me they took them and they didn't have a right to take them they
[09:35.400 --> 09:38.360]  didn't have a reason to take you never expect to do this in your own country
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.880]  Chris Montgomery says he'd rather be in Iraq than patrolling American
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.840]  neighborhoods walking up and down these streets you don't you don't want to
[09:46.840 --> 09:49.320]  think about the stuff that you're gonna have to do somebody pops around the
[09:49.320 --> 09:55.920]  corner me shooting America yeah you know them by their fruits as Christ said
[09:55.920 --> 10:02.320]  a leopard never changes its spots here in focus is the treason of honor a
[10:02.320 --> 10:28.400]  against the Second Amendment and America big brother mainstream media
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.120]  government cover-up you want to stop tyranny well so does he live from the
[10:35.120 --> 10:40.720]  info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones

[10:49.120 --> 10:53.840]  engaged and listening and taking action all of us every race color and creed who
[10:53.840 --> 11:00.560]  love God and justice are coming like maus to the flames but evil is coming
[11:00.560 --> 11:06.720]  like maus that flame as well the flame of liberty the flame of our children's
[11:06.720 --> 11:12.680]  destiny to live innocent lives and to be able to have their own free will that is
[11:12.680 --> 11:17.640]  under attack we have so much news today we made really really good time back
[11:17.640 --> 11:21.760]  from a callin normally takes about six hours to get back we got back in less
[11:21.760 --> 11:26.920]  than five that's good drivers and so I'm here and and Owen's gonna be riding
[11:26.920 --> 11:30.720]  shotgun with me for an hour so before he goes it's ready to take over his own
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.440]  show 3 p.m. Central today I'm your host Alex Jones and we have Roger Stone
[11:34.440 --> 11:37.840]  popping in next segment remember he told you a month ago they're gonna start by
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.720]  indicting the company and the heads of Trump's company and then they're gonna
[11:41.720 --> 11:45.400]  move against Trump that's what Democrats are planning you heard earlier in the
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.200]  week oh that's not true Trump's lawyers said but now the head of Trump's company
[11:50.200 --> 11:55.000]  has been indicted pled not guilty did absolutely nothing they say oh during a
[11:55.000 --> 12:00.880]  divorce Trump might have let one of his children was getting divorced stay in a
[12:00.880 --> 12:04.800]  condo because he was kicked out of the other condo that his wife was living in
[12:04.800 --> 12:09.280]  oh and maybe they were able to use company cars maybe company pencils to
[12:09.280 --> 12:14.520]  Owen oh no and if he had to you know cut a check it may have been a pen Alex I
[12:14.520 --> 12:20.360]  mean God forbid but you know when you watch that video that we came in with and
[12:20.360 --> 12:24.880]  you realize how serious the situation that this country is in right now I mean
[12:24.880 --> 12:30.480]  folks we've got communists and globalists breathing down the neck of the
[12:30.480 --> 12:34.080]  United States China threatened war against us in a huge speech today I
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.960]  mean the fangs are out you know you see the vampire creeping up and then you see
[12:38.960 --> 12:42.080]  them getting right there ready to bite your neck and then the fangs come out
[12:42.080 --> 12:46.120]  and then it's time and then it's the bite comes right Dracula is lunging on our
[12:46.120 --> 12:51.480]  throat right now and so the analogy of the flame of liberty you know the the
[12:51.480 --> 12:55.360]  people have the people going to it or I don't know whatever the numbers are the
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.520]  communists going towards the light of liberty the torturing they're going to
[12:58.520 --> 13:02.640]  extinguish exactly they want to put it out meanwhile freedom lovers are on a
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.760]  kamikaze mission to the flame of liberty to do anything to keep it going
[13:07.760 --> 13:11.160]  even if that means jumping into it themselves to spontaneously combust
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.680]  because we know we're about to go into the tunnel we're about to be under total
[13:15.680 --> 13:21.080]  communist takeover reeducation that's their plan they don't want to just take
[13:21.080 --> 13:26.240]  the US over they want to butcher it chop it in pieces for maybe 80 90 years like
[13:26.240 --> 13:31.560]  the Russians I mean they want to break our spirit and for some people this
[13:31.560 --> 13:35.360]  information this intelligence is tough to swallow because they they haven't
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.640]  really seen it play out like we have an info wars for the last decade and the
[13:40.640 --> 13:43.840]  doctor that I had on yesterday that was that was on the Alex Jones show that I
[13:43.840 --> 13:47.800]  interviewed it was such a powerful interview and and sometimes when you're
[13:47.800 --> 13:51.280]  talking to people like that like that doctor who's so informed when it comes
[13:51.280 --> 13:55.040]  to the vaccines and COVID and everything and and you're talking to her and you're
[13:55.040 --> 13:57.920]  going through things in your own head and you realize again we already we
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.600]  already knew this but like you play it out in two simple sentences they made a
[14:02.600 --> 14:06.640]  gain of function virus they intentionally made a gain of function
[14:06.640 --> 14:10.760]  virus to be to be released to be used on people I mean why else would you make it
[14:10.760 --> 14:15.680]  that's why they make it to be used on people and then they intentionally
[14:15.680 --> 14:20.160]  censored and made cures to to the sickness of the virus called illegal
[14:20.160 --> 14:24.960]  illegal I mean what is that and notice he's a prestigious medical doctor he's
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.000]  testified to the Senate she goes listen this is all just main line every doctor
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.400]  knows this it's like in America we drive on the right hand side of the road in
[14:33.400 --> 14:38.720]  England the left hand it's like the sun is yellow this stop signs are red they
[14:38.720 --> 14:42.240]  said oh if you're having trouble breathing from pneumonia or flu or whatever
[14:42.240 --> 14:45.640]  don't come to the doctor until you're really sick then they call that COVID it
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.040]  was all premeditated default against known medicine and they go it's the
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.400]  science it's the science it's the science these people need to be arrested and
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.520]  then they'll blow your lungs out on a ventilator which is the new guillotine
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.280]  and then they'll send you you know your COVID infected grandma into the nursing
[15:03.280 --> 15:06.320]  home to kill the rest of the grandma's and grandpa's in there and by the way
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.600]  we don't know any medical doctors defending what the system is done none
[15:10.600 --> 15:15.920]  well there are some like Vin Gupta but that's because he's a CNN guest maybe
[15:15.920 --> 15:19.320]  even you know a federal shill or something like that he'll tell us that
[15:19.320 --> 15:23.160]  there's a down down is out there now they're saying oh just get every
[15:23.160 --> 15:26.680]  vaccine just get every vaccine get it once get it twice get it as many times
[15:26.680 --> 15:29.400]  you know because it's safe and effective and then they go oh but it doesn't help
[15:29.400 --> 15:32.640]  you so keep wearing your mask but imagine oh we need new lockdowns oh my gosh
[15:32.640 --> 15:37.440]  the delta plus but let but here's the formula as as we go to break here okay
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.920]  someone made and released a virus that can kill you and they're also making it
[15:42.920 --> 15:46.520]  illegal the cures to the sickness of that virus what what is that equal folks
[15:46.520 --> 15:51.000]  someone's trying to kill you oh and the very same group all met until they want
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.440]  to depopulate us and and oh it's like I don't want to be the doctor telling you
[15:54.440 --> 15:57.160]  you have internal disease but someone's trying to kill you in case you have a

[17:10.920 --> 17:15.560]  trying to get a hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I have
[17:15.560 --> 17:20.760]  bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my
[17:20.760 --> 17:25.600]  life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living
[17:25.600 --> 17:30.480]  defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying
[17:30.480 --> 17:35.760]  as to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall
[17:35.760 --> 17:42.120]  deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all
[17:42.120 --> 17:47.320]  nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray
[17:47.320 --> 17:51.720]  one another and shall hate one another right where we're at brother and that's
[17:51.720 --> 17:55.480]  because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say
[17:55.480 --> 18:01.080]  and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country I'm a very
[18:01.080 --> 18:05.640]  humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are with the
[18:05.640 --> 18:08.960]  globalist attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are unfolding I
[18:08.960 --> 18:13.960]  want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well I'm a
[18:13.960 --> 18:17.440]  public figure so I get to see things the Republic doesn't need to see and let me
[18:17.440 --> 18:22.240]  tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in
[18:22.240 --> 18:27.840]  Hollywood or or mainstream media or industry people are really really awake
[18:27.840 --> 18:31.880]  in the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalists but they're
[18:31.880 --> 18:36.440]  scared they're looking for leadership well that's where info comes in you
[18:36.440 --> 18:39.680]  fund us you support them for worse or calm you get rape prostitution at the
[18:39.680 --> 18:44.560]  same time we will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular but
[18:44.560 --> 18:48.380]  the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the
[18:48.380 --> 18:54.240]  truth and to take the heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can
[18:54.240 --> 18:57.680]  hit the barbed wire so we can be the shock groups the information war
[18:57.680 --> 19:25.360]  fund us and for store.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[19:25.360 --> 19:30.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Alex Jones. We've got the host of the War Room. I was Troy riding shotgun in the former
[19:30.800 --> 19:35.680]  co-host of the War Room. Famous political prisoner. Long-time political operative in
[19:35.680 --> 19:40.760]  Patriot Roger Stone for one segment only. Hopping in with his prediction a month
[19:40.760 --> 19:44.120]  ago they would begin indicting leaders of the Trump organization that has now
[19:44.120 --> 19:48.520]  come true unfortunately Alan Weiselberg he says is a great guy has now pled not
[19:48.520 --> 19:54.000]  guilty to using company cars and during a divorce with his son was getting
[19:54.000 --> 19:59.520]  divorced Trump letting use a condo for a few months. Oh my gosh. Did he let him use
[19:59.520 --> 20:05.680]  posted notes to Roger. You know Alex that the juxtaposition of this with say
[20:05.680 --> 20:10.080]  Hunter Biden is extraordinary. Hunter Biden still has a two hundred million
[20:10.080 --> 20:15.440]  dollars stake in a investment fund in which his partner is the Chinese
[20:15.440 --> 20:18.760]  Communist Party. But no there's no indictment there. Instead we're going to
[20:18.760 --> 20:23.280]  indict poor Alan Weiselberg because he used a car or a condo for a few months.
[20:23.280 --> 20:27.920]  This is really Mickey Mouse nonsense. But it's meant to sully the president's
[20:27.920 --> 20:32.280]  reputation. It's meant to to generate negative headlines which it certainly
[20:32.280 --> 20:36.560]  has done because the Democrats do not want to run against Donald Trump again
[20:36.560 --> 20:42.200]  in twenty twenty four. That's what this is really about. Tell us about Weiselberg.
[20:42.200 --> 20:45.720]  You've done Trump 45 years. I don't Weiselberg was a confidant of Trump's
[20:45.720 --> 20:50.440]  father. I don't think you can get you know closer to the family unless you've
[20:50.440 --> 20:54.840]  got bloodier. He has said that Trump's done nothing. He's done nothing. This is
[20:54.840 --> 21:01.360]  just outrageous. Alan Weiselberg is a very decent man. He is a devout Jew. He
[21:01.360 --> 21:06.120]  is a financial genius keeping track of all of the various businesses of Donald
[21:06.120 --> 21:11.720]  Trump is an enormous enterprise. He is very shrewd. He is very honest. He's
[21:11.720 --> 21:16.680]  very meticulous. Hard for me to believe that this man did anything wrong. And I
[21:16.680 --> 21:20.520]  know what it's like to be squeezed by a prosecutor. I know what it's like to be
[21:20.520 --> 21:24.320]  threatened that you'll spend the rest of your life in prison if you don't say
[21:24.320 --> 21:29.520]  what they want you to say. My heart goes out to both Alan and his family. He's a
[21:29.520 --> 21:34.040]  fine man. And I think he is being subjected to a witch hunt. Well it's
[21:34.040 --> 21:41.160]  just amazing to me that I'm reading this indictment and it says during his
[21:41.160 --> 21:44.800]  son's divorce years ago they let him use a condo when he was kicked out of the
[21:44.800 --> 21:52.040]  house and maybe a car and maybe a bonus at Christmas time or something. I mean
[21:52.040 --> 21:56.240]  this is cash. I mean this is insane. It's like saying he might have had a crooked
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.480]  toenail at one point compared to just what the Democrats publicly promoting
[22:00.480 --> 22:05.480]  pedophilia. World government smuggling children over the border. I mean it's
[22:05.480 --> 22:11.240]  just it's two different universes. It's really extraordinary how minor this is
[22:11.240 --> 22:15.760]  particularly given the enormous buildup this got from the mainstream media.
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.760]  Trump about to be indicted and so on. The other instance I read about was
[22:20.760 --> 22:27.120]  Matthew Calamari. Long time associate of Trump was the COO of this company. He
[22:27.120 --> 22:30.840]  may have gotten some insurance benefits that he didn't properly report on his
[22:30.840 --> 22:36.160]  income taxes. Please give me a break. I mean you have massive crimes going on in
[22:36.160 --> 22:41.200]  Washington D.C. New revelations that Joe Biden attended business meetings
[22:41.200 --> 22:46.120]  for his son's businesses specifically went to a restaurant which we learned
[22:46.120 --> 22:50.600]  about a week ten days ago which he denied but no there's no investigation
[22:50.600 --> 22:54.400]  into any of that. This is where hundreds and millions of dollars have changed
[22:54.400 --> 22:59.440]  chance. No investigation into that. You know this tells me about Trump. He's
[22:59.440 --> 23:02.560]  got to be one of the cleanest people that has any big business ever heard of
[23:02.560 --> 23:05.760]  because the way they write laws everybody's doing something wrong. I mean
[23:05.760 --> 23:09.440]  letting people use a condo during a family problem or letting someone use a
[23:09.440 --> 23:14.040]  company car. We have a couple company cars. I mean Owen drives a company car.
[23:14.040 --> 23:18.560]  Does that mean that I've paid you off in some criminal action? I mean this is
[23:18.560 --> 23:22.880]  just next level. This shows me that Trump is like an angel. I mean who could
[23:22.880 --> 23:27.400]  have hundreds of properties and all this and not have anything going on wrong
[23:27.400 --> 23:31.760]  with federal investigation, state investigation, city investigations. All
[23:31.760 --> 23:36.080]  these people being threatened who they've gone and rolled up for crimes they
[23:36.080 --> 23:40.640]  committed separately saying we'll we'll let you off just make something up and
[23:40.640 --> 23:45.920]  they can't even get anybody to do it. Well congratulations Owen. Alex just put a
[23:45.920 --> 23:49.480]  big old target on your back. I'm sure you'll be. Yeah that's all right Roger
[23:49.480 --> 23:52.760]  expanded about half an inch from that comment so that's okay. No no it's not
[23:52.760 --> 23:56.320]  even that well no we've got two company cars and one time your car was in the
[23:56.320 --> 24:00.400]  shop and you used the company car like a month. But it's ridiculous. The point is I
[24:00.400 --> 24:04.320]  work for the company. I need to get to work. What am I supposed to do if I don't
[24:04.320 --> 24:10.080]  have a car? The point is that during the ice storm I let the engineers use my
[24:10.080 --> 24:13.860]  personal truck. Oh my god they use the truck for a week. Are we going to get
[24:13.860 --> 24:19.160]  arrested for that? Look I'm making a joke to make a serious point which is this
[24:19.160 --> 24:23.360]  is all petty anti-stuff. I think we know what happened here. The Mueller
[24:23.360 --> 24:27.080]  investigators looked at all this same material all these same business records
[24:27.080 --> 24:30.840]  turn them over to the state of New York and they have a fishing expedition. No
[24:30.840 --> 24:34.880]  probable cause no evidence of a crime but let's let's just keep looking. Why was
[24:34.880 --> 24:38.640]  it Stalin said show me the man. I'll show you the crime. I think that's exactly
[24:38.640 --> 24:44.760]  what's going on here. Call it which which on 3.0 at this point. Roger I've
[24:44.760 --> 24:49.840]  never been so stunned at a political prosecution as this. I mean you did
[24:49.840 --> 24:53.360]  nothing wrong but they at least tried to cook something up. This is he let
[24:53.360 --> 24:56.520]  somebody use a condo when they were in trouble and a car the heads of the
[24:56.520 --> 24:59.280]  company. I figured they'd have a lot more than that. They could just put it on
[24:59.280 --> 25:04.000]  and it's all on paper. This is literally saying we're taking you to jail because
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.400]  you wiped your ass. Well but Alex let's be clear the investigation is not over
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.600]  that even the president's lawyer said that he was not being charged at this
[25:13.600 --> 25:18.520]  time. Not sure what that means. I'm praying that the president is safe. I'm
[25:18.520 --> 25:23.680]  praying that they will use better judgment and drop this nonsense but this
[25:23.680 --> 25:27.720]  is still an open question as far as I'm concerned and I'm hopeful that the
[25:27.720 --> 25:33.280]  president has a strategy in the right lawyer. If in fact he ends up being
[25:33.280 --> 25:37.480]  dragged into the middle of this this circus which is what it is. But here's
[25:37.480 --> 25:42.640]  what's not an open question. This is a hundred percent political and everybody
[25:42.640 --> 25:46.160]  knows it. Why isn't the Republican Party making more of a fuss. Why isn't the
[25:46.160 --> 25:52.080]  Republican Party up in arms about this political harassment. There's a never
[25:52.080 --> 25:57.840]  underestimate the stupidity of the Republican Party. This is a a feckless
[25:57.840 --> 26:04.120]  weak need gutless group of leaders in the house particularly who never want to
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.920]  do battle who always want to make a deal. And then you've got patriots like Matt
[26:07.920 --> 26:15.720]  Gates Jim Jordan Lee Seldin in the Senate. You've got Ron pardon me Ron Paul
[26:15.720 --> 26:20.200]  and the senator from Louisiana. I mean there are a few people there who are
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.880]  who are brave and courageous and willing to take the radical left and the
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.520]  Democrats on but not within the Republican Party leadership. Roger we
[26:29.520 --> 26:32.200]  only got a minute and a half but you said they're going to start with the
[26:32.200 --> 26:36.320]  organization and move on. Notice Trump's lawyers say Trump's not being indicted
[26:36.320 --> 26:39.760]  now. You're still extremely concerned and I would say your prediction has come
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.600]  true. Well look I love the president. I don't want anything bad to happen to him
[26:44.600 --> 26:48.920]  and I would like to see him run again in 2024 and I recognize the entire
[26:48.920 --> 26:55.960]  political nature of this. It is its politics run amok. You have a one-party
[26:55.960 --> 27:00.280]  state essentially in New York. The Republicans hold no statewide offices
[27:00.280 --> 27:05.000]  hold neither chamber of their legislature certainly in New York City.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  One could never expect a fair trial. I've been subjected to a D.C. jury. I think
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.720]  a Manhattan jury would be very similar. So why are they doing it just because
[27:16.720 --> 27:19.960]  they think mainstream media will paper over this and make this look like the
[27:19.960 --> 27:25.000]  Trump's dirty. This makes Trump look like an angel. I think they recognize that the
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.360]  average citizen just sees the headline they don't read into the body of the
[27:28.360 --> 27:33.040]  story so Trump's organization charged with criminal activity sure it splashes up
[27:33.040 --> 27:38.160]  on Donald Trump. That's the idea. It's the same kind of malicious attacks he's
[27:38.160 --> 27:43.360]  been subjected to by the fake news media for four long years. Nothing new here.
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.960]  Well I've experienced it with these Democrat funded lawsuits. They'll take anything
[27:46.960 --> 27:51.480]  and just lie about it or make stuff up is even true. It's insane. Roger Stone thank
[27:51.480 --> 27:54.360]  you so much for the time. Look forward to speaking to you again very very soon.
[27:54.360 --> 28:00.560]  All right. Owen Schreuer's with me riding shotgun. We've got a ton of news.
[28:00.720 --> 28:05.200]  The globalists are having their revolution but for humanity has to have
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.960]  its revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[28:10.960 --> 28:17.680]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into
[28:17.680 --> 28:26.680]  these artificial corporate controlled slaves. Worse than slaves. Just property
[28:26.680 --> 28:32.320]  from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions of
[28:32.320 --> 28:37.520]  the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control. We have to recognize
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.080]  the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and
[28:42.080 --> 28:45.840]  we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[28:45.840 --> 28:51.600]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world and it's
[28:51.600 --> 28:56.040]  the only choice we've got. Freedom or slavery go to evil. It is a spiritual
[28:56.040 --> 29:00.200]  battle and in full wars at the tip of the spear fighting it. The fourth of July

[30:10.000 --> 30:13.880]  as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have
[30:13.880 --> 30:18.880]  being given free will. Being given free will being given consciousness is
[30:18.880 --> 30:24.800]  literally the seed of an entire universe an entire system and the fact that
[30:24.800 --> 30:27.920]  you're able to commune with God the fact you're able to see the beauty of the
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.120]  sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife your
[30:32.120 --> 30:36.640]  husband the beauty of your child learning knowledge the beauty of music the
[30:36.640 --> 30:41.000]  fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that
[30:41.000 --> 30:46.400]  itself is what God teaches us is worship so don't worship the globalist don't
[30:46.400 --> 30:50.400]  worship the NFL don't worship all the things of the system but worship the
[30:50.400 --> 30:54.800]  things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness and
[30:54.800 --> 31:02.640]  appreciate free speech while you still have it while you still have it you're
[31:02.640 --> 31:28.640]  listening to the Alex Jones show
[31:32.640 --> 31:43.400]  Monday through Friday we are here live from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. central
[31:43.400 --> 31:49.620]  standard time of course we have American Journal with Harrison Smith 8 a.m. to 11
[31:49.620 --> 31:54.120]  a.m. and the War Room with Owen Schreuer 3 to 6 p.m. I also do a lot of special
[31:54.120 --> 31:58.480]  transmissions and I'm seriously considering so much news is breaking on
[31:58.480 --> 32:03.400]  coming in Saturday and doing a special broadcast and a special broadcast on
[32:03.400 --> 32:07.280]  Sunday and maybe even on Monday because we need to really understand this could
[32:07.280 --> 32:12.080]  be the last July 4th ever in this country effect you could say last year was
[32:12.080 --> 32:16.760]  we really are a congregation if we're not honest with ourselves about how much
[32:16.760 --> 32:21.280]  trouble we're in we have no hope so I'm just asking listeners to realize that
[32:21.280 --> 32:25.720]  this is the moment of truth because if people realize this is a globalist take
[32:25.720 --> 32:31.800]  over at every level and reject it or we just acclimate ourselves and submit to
[32:31.800 --> 32:39.880]  it and it's over so that is the point as a civilization as a species that we're
[32:39.880 --> 32:44.560]  at this point of no return we're gonna decide what we're gonna do now so let
[32:44.560 --> 32:48.760]  me just show you some of the news that we have here for you
[32:48.760 --> 32:53.480]  G.P. you know he's the dictator that has all the one-sided policies by the
[32:53.480 --> 32:58.280]  globalist to build them up and not us up she gives blistering Taiwan reunification

[33:19.840 --> 33:25.480]  actually happening UN controlled Davos group pushes new lockdowns citing
[33:25.480 --> 33:33.240]  Delta plus variant lie it's all lies we told you over a year ago they'll take
[33:33.240 --> 33:36.840]  some of the lockdowns off a little bit and then as soon as they've done that
[33:36.840 --> 33:40.400]  they'll clamp them right back down again claiming variants now how did I know
[33:40.400 --> 33:44.920]  that because people are going and finding us 14 15 16 months ago predicting
[33:44.920 --> 33:50.240]  it all because I know the enemy they admitted their own white papers that
[33:50.240 --> 33:56.040]  they want a permanent lockdown but they want you to have the illusion that it's
[33:56.040 --> 34:00.880]  going to be unlocked from time to time so you don't build opposition to them so
[34:00.880 --> 34:09.480]  every time opposition builds they will then loosen up a bit but only to kill
[34:09.480 --> 34:14.560]  the opposition building and coalescing and taking back power it's a psychological
[34:14.560 --> 34:19.200]  warfare system they very successfully use we'll be looking at all of that COVID
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.840]  news now it ties together with communist China then it's just gotten too over the
[34:24.840 --> 34:30.120]  top disgusting we're gonna hit this coming up next segment yes kink belongs
[34:30.120 --> 34:35.760]  at pride and I want my kids to see it many eating feces drinking urine and
[34:35.760 --> 34:40.480]  having sex in public that's what goes on at the gay pride parades I've never been
[34:40.480 --> 34:45.560]  to one but I've seen the videos and it is it is beyond disgusting it's about
[34:45.560 --> 34:51.840]  the filing yourself there in the system and that ties into now the celebration
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.240]  of men coming in and showing little girls their penises in the showers and
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.680]  saying oh isn't it beautiful I've had sex with hundreds of women and so that's
[35:01.680 --> 35:05.720]  what terrorizing these poor children is about and most of these people at these
[35:05.720 --> 35:09.800]  parades have been sexually abused themselves that's why there's very zombie
[35:09.800 --> 35:15.520]  like and seem to have no life in them so truly truly evil it's all about
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.520]  pedophilia Spock he has doubled down saying oh yes it's the Republicans be
[35:19.520 --> 35:23.480]  fighting the police and that's who's caused the crime wave Republicans have
[35:23.480 --> 35:28.160]  just laid they're taking it because they're such pathetic jellyfish also
[35:28.160 --> 35:33.000]  turn off those big billboards all over the world the globalist are saying turn
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.040]  down your thermostat or turn it up there's not enough power and they're
[35:37.040 --> 35:40.580]  going to charge you more it's all about carbon taxes but then oh all the big
[35:40.580 --> 35:44.160]  corporations and all the big billboards they of course stay fully energized
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.320]  because they're essential you're not we're going to get to all of that and
[35:48.320 --> 35:55.040]  then I spoke about white papers here with you I spoke about white papers we
[35:55.040 --> 36:00.400]  actually have some Davos group white papers I spent a couple hours yesterday
[36:00.400 --> 36:05.240]  last night reading some of the new white papers on how to censor everyone in
[36:05.240 --> 36:10.440]  the world through global governance that's a quote and how they are the
[36:10.440 --> 36:15.600]  global government the corporate world government with the UN so between the UN
[36:15.600 --> 36:21.840]  and big tech and big farm and the big corporations they have a plan to end all
[36:21.840 --> 36:26.160]  inequality and you guessed it to end whiteness and in the family this is all
[36:26.160 --> 36:30.040]  coming out of the Davos group save world economic forum pledges to censor
[36:30.040 --> 36:36.880]  health misinformation and anti-vaccine content I read completely five or six
[36:36.880 --> 36:40.560]  of the white papers the new ones that just came out this month and I scanned
[36:40.560 --> 36:45.360]  over another ten or so and let me tell you is it rich reading and remember
[36:45.360 --> 36:49.720]  these are the self-appointed corporate board where the corporation set the
[36:49.720 --> 36:54.720]  policy the fortune 100 controlled by the big banks and then they tell you how
[36:54.720 --> 36:58.720]  you're going to be living so until we organize against this and use our own
[36:58.720 --> 37:02.600]  regional governments to say no and our own individual companies to say no and
[37:02.600 --> 37:05.960]  our own individual will to say no we have no hope because world government is
[37:05.960 --> 37:11.800]  here the new order is a corporate world government so that is coming up with all
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.720]  the censorship rolling out right as Davos snaps his fingers Trudeau one of the
[37:16.720 --> 37:19.800]  leaders of implementing the new order who says he wants to be a Chinese
[37:19.800 --> 37:24.160]  dictator he they've now introduced the worst censorship law of any Western
[37:24.160 --> 37:29.800]  democracy allowing live-time surveillance of everyone and banning of anything that
[37:29.800 --> 37:34.960]  the UN trained censors say they're not going to allow and now they have major
[37:34.960 --> 37:40.840]  leaders of state leaders of province leaders saying we're never going to
[37:40.840 --> 37:44.640]  allow demonstrations or gatherings again because that allows unauthorized
[37:44.640 --> 37:49.440]  communication so we're just openly going into worldwide martial law and they
[37:49.440 --> 37:52.320]  just hope to acclimate us and oh and I think you said it earlier and on the
[37:52.320 --> 37:56.840]  show yesterday the biggest problem is the opposition in Europe the opposition
[37:56.840 --> 38:01.080]  here and in Australia doesn't realize how much trouble we're in and just eats
[38:01.080 --> 38:05.000]  around the edges of this instead of pointing out this is a UN corporate
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.400]  world government takeover as China as the model and this is the new world war
[38:09.400 --> 38:14.120]  it's a new type of war you're expecting army tanks and fighter planes and that's
[38:14.120 --> 38:18.360]  that's part of it later but but this is really economic takeover war bullying
[38:18.360 --> 38:23.360]  war and so it's not just misguided leftist this is a scientific blueprint in
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.200]  their own words well that's the problem is you know just like the media is 10
[38:28.200 --> 38:31.780]  or 20 years behind info wars simply just because they don't want to be fully
[38:31.780 --> 38:35.000]  honest with their audience most of the stuff that Alex or I talk about on air
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.760]  the person the average person on Fox News or whatever will talk about behind
[38:38.760 --> 38:41.720]  the scenes with their family at the bar at dinner whatever they know it's all
[38:41.720 --> 38:44.880]  going on they're just not going to talk about it on TV so that causes the
[38:44.880 --> 38:49.480]  public to also kind of be 10 20 years behind and that's why they're so stunned
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.520]  when they see info was reports from 10 years ago or whatever that are calling
[38:52.520 --> 38:55.520]  out everything that's happening now no we're just being real about what's
[38:55.520 --> 39:00.000]  going on it's not that hard to predict the obvious and so that's what's going on
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.500]  here people say how did you exactly know there'd be a new variant because they
[39:03.500 --> 39:07.880]  said in a white papers 10 years ago once we watch this virus will then have new
[39:07.880 --> 39:11.400]  variants to keep people locked down and then we'll reduce the lockdowns from time
[39:11.400 --> 39:14.920]  to time to renew hope but only clamp them down more to save the earth from carbon
[39:14.920 --> 39:19.240]  I mean it's all stated and so they can slowly roll this out in a short five
[39:19.240 --> 39:22.560]  year stretch is what looks like their goal is going to be oh the medical
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.000]  tyranny and you don't really know what's behind it you just think oh there's this
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.680]  deadly virus and oh all this stuff is getting shut down what's going on whoa
[39:29.680 --> 39:32.640]  this is kind of weird this kind of crazy this is not right this isn't America
[39:32.640 --> 39:36.040]  well yeah it's been in the works for for five years and now oh sorry that
[39:36.040 --> 39:40.160]  vaccine doesn't work now you've got to take more vaccines oh sorry yeah a lot
[39:40.160 --> 39:43.680]  of people are dying from it but no big deal don't talk about it it's all been
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.640]  planned and by the time that reality catches up to you the new tyranny is
[39:48.640 --> 39:51.800]  going to arrive and it's going to shock you and son you're not going to know
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.720]  what to deal with it and that's the environmental tyranny that's that's the
[39:54.720 --> 39:59.240]  you're not that's what Davos said they said segue with the COVID lockdown into
[39:59.240 --> 40:03.480]  the new carbon lockdowns and and and all the new green deals and admissions that
[40:03.480 --> 40:06.440]  leftist can build buildings but you can't build buildings your political
[40:06.440 --> 40:09.880]  affiliation in Austin is whether or not you get a permit I mean this is
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.880]  real communism and hey you know what I think that everybody could get behind
[40:13.880 --> 40:17.560]  hey let's save energy let's conserve energy fine that's no big deal but you
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.040]  can't make it a government mandate to limit how much energy you can use and
[40:23.040 --> 40:30.640]  and like it's a good point so who decides that 30 40 50 100 200 300 billboards in
[40:30.640 --> 40:35.960]  New York City and Times Square get to be lit 24 7 but I don't get to keep my
[40:35.960 --> 40:41.840]  thermostat below 69 degrees in the heat of summer and oh you put in that little
[40:41.840 --> 40:45.240]  remote control Google thermostat in the terms and services they're going to
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.880]  control your thermos yeah but oh but I can control it from my cell phone it's
[40:49.880 --> 40:57.280]  so trendy I can control my AC from the cell phone Alex yeah yeah good stay
[40:57.280 --> 41:00.880]  with us we'll be right back again I don't like to lecture people I'm a very
[41:00.880 --> 41:04.640]  private person but because of the globalist their attack on humanity I've
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.240]  been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given the
[41:08.240 --> 41:12.760]  globalist one hell of a run for their money because of God and I know some of
[41:12.760 --> 41:15.680]  our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day but just give me a break the
[41:15.680 --> 41:20.000]  Satanism's out the open I've always been a Christian but now the fact that it's a
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.240]  fight between good and evil is so clear and I get it while you've been turned
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.960]  off by big churches while you've been turned off by the corrupt priest class
[41:27.960 --> 41:32.480]  system and I get it me too believe me I'm one of them but it's that relationship
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.160]  with God and just God's universe that God created that is so essential and and
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.840]  God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.560]  life and so that's what info wars is really all about so thank you all for
[41:45.560 --> 41:48.360]  your word of mouth thank you for spreading the word about info wars and

[45:32.760 --> 45:36.600]  day or two we're not like looking for this it's just everywhere here's the
[45:36.600 --> 45:47.600]  washington post lauren growl oh yes cake belongs at pride and I want my kids to
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.200]  see it you see the total sexualization of children everywhere pedophilia being
[45:52.200 --> 45:56.360]  promoted there's the washington post in an article showing things I don't want
[45:56.360 --> 46:00.680]  to show our audience because you don't want to look at dudes and g strings and
[46:00.680 --> 46:05.040]  men dressed up like animals and you know men shaking their butts and little kids
[46:05.040 --> 46:10.840]  faces but it's all super inappropriate it'd be like if you took your five-year-old
[46:10.840 --> 46:15.440]  daughter or son to a topless bar which they do that too which which would well
[46:15.440 --> 46:19.400]  only if it's gay if it's a little boy at a men's bar they throw money at him and
[46:19.400 --> 46:23.480]  say I want to have sex with you well he's a tough kid he can take it so I'm not
[46:23.480 --> 46:27.840]  gonna read you the article it's totally sick my wife is trans and it just goes on
[46:27.840 --> 46:31.800]  to talk all about how wanted to see people cutting themselves deprecating on
[46:31.800 --> 46:38.040]  the streets I mean ladies and gentlemen if you want to see something crazy you
[46:38.040 --> 46:41.360]  definitely go online and look at some videos of some gay pride parades I would
[46:41.360 --> 46:47.000]  call it lost people trying to kill themselves in slow motion so washington
[46:47.000 --> 46:52.120]  post writer calls for children to watch kink at parades and then they show
[46:52.120 --> 46:58.320]  little cute girls smiling with with men dressed up like wolves which they're
[46:58.320 --> 47:03.400]  telling you we've got your kids they're captured and putting them through this
[47:03.400 --> 47:08.360]  hell and this is the the light stuff ladies and gentlemen now let's shift
[47:08.360 --> 47:13.000]  gears to that article from four or five days ago that's been a big national
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.760]  story video spa staff dismissed woman's complaint about man exposing his penis to
[47:18.760 --> 47:22.600]  little girls in female area remember what Chris Cuomo said four or five years
[47:22.600 --> 47:26.800]  ago he said oh people are complaining in public schools that in middle schools
[47:26.800 --> 47:32.200]  that if the coach is a man but thinks he's a woman and wants to take showers
[47:32.200 --> 47:36.400]  with your 11 year old daughter they should celebrate that your daughter is
[47:36.400 --> 47:41.080]  a bigot if she doesn't want her coach now imagine Gillette commercials and the
[47:41.080 --> 47:44.840]  left teaches men shouldn't hey hey lady I think you're pretty come have a coffee
[47:44.840 --> 47:50.560]  or go get a drink with me or all sex heterosexuals is right or you know you
[47:50.560 --> 47:54.760]  know men being masculine is aggressive all that's bad all traditional real
[47:54.760 --> 48:01.760]  human activity biological activities bad but if it's going to taking a child to
[48:01.760 --> 48:07.280]  a homosexual bar so money can be thrown at them and they can dress dance around
[48:07.280 --> 48:11.960]  in a negligee that's wonderful and now if a man and it turns out they've got
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.680]  other cases of the same spa wants to go in and say I've had sex with hundreds of
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.560]  women here's my genitals but I'm a woman so now I've got to get a jail card they
[48:20.560 --> 48:25.080]  wouldn't even help her and now the spa isn't denying it they're defending it

[52:35.720 --> 52:39.720]  declined to comment but say they do follow state law which makes discriminating
[52:39.720 --> 52:43.840]  against trans and other non-conforming people in business establishments
[52:43.840 --> 52:49.360]  illegal California is the state in the whole nation that has the most trans
[52:49.360 --> 52:56.040]  inclusive legislation and obviously different local governments also adopt
[52:56.040 --> 53:00.680]  some of those okay so let's stop right there oh and responding to this this is

[58:46.640 --> 58:53.080]  kink at pride parades and this creature that wrote this big article for the
[58:53.080 --> 58:59.560]  Washington Post look at those zombified eyes says I am a gender vague person who
[58:59.560 --> 59:04.000]  is married to a trans woman topics related to gender and queer identity
[59:04.000 --> 59:08.920]  aren't an important focus of our work Lauren is a former sex worker and team
[59:08.920 --> 59:13.800]  parent who is writing essays and a memoir about their experience the
[59:13.800 --> 59:18.680]  Philadelphia area native Lauren is an autistic person raising two neuro
[59:18.680 --> 59:23.560]  divergent kids in South Jersey and you know they're taking all their poison
[59:23.560 --> 59:29.320]  shots they are committed as zombies to on their anti-human quest that the
[59:29.320 --> 59:33.320]  Washington Post is gonna publish and so we can be lectured about all women at
[59:33.320 --> 59:36.920]  the local gym don't want to do propositioning him with his large
[59:36.920 --> 59:42.040]  member hanging out they're bad oh but a guy asking her on a date is bad the
[59:42.040 --> 59:47.280]  nuclear family is bad it's insane and then I've got this article we seem to
[59:47.280 --> 59:56.280]  see it every couple days with this FBI agent another FBI agent has been
[59:56.280 --> 1:00:04.040]  arrested and convicted for raping little kids ladies and gentlemen and that was
[1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:10.160]  in my that was in my stack here it is overhead shot please second FBI agent in
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:16.160]  two months arrested for raping molesting small children 51-year-old David
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:20.800]  Harris is an active the FBI agent in New Orleans field office and it goes into
[1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:28.880]  the horrible things that has been going on and you realize this is an army of
[1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:32.840]  these people and they're getting into all the major positions of power was
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:35.800]  getting an FBI agent who's been arrested in Louisiana State Police Bureau of
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:39.240]  Investigation Special Victims Unit in the United States Department of Justice
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:43.080]  Inspector General we're using all these smuggled kids out of Latin America go
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:46.920]  for sexual misconduct against juveniles according to a press release
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:54.120]  Harris 51 was booked on numerous sexual misconduct charges he was arrested in the
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:57.680]  parish and booked on charges of aggravated crimes against nature and
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:04.280]  innocent behavior with children under the age of 13 but see they got a main line
[1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:09.440]  it real quick it's why they're at war with civilization they got a main line at fast
[1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:15.960]  I'll ensure your comments on this so the Washington Post has a mentally
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:20.840]  retarded hooker writing for it that's where we're at now that the blinds
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:24.520]  leading the blind she's now raising their own autistic children isn't it
[1:01:24.520 --> 1:01:27.560]  magic you know they're all on drugs they're all locked out they're all in
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:31.680]  welfare and they're creating these people to be the permanent kept slaves of
[1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:36.680]  system again this is a child psychology and you know it's like a young child
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:40.680]  does something wrong at home you know spills a glass of milk or breaks the
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:44.200]  vase or whatever the first step is open I didn't do it I didn't do it and then
[1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:47.680]  blame someone else and you know try to try to obfuscate somehow once you've
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:50.440]  been caught it's just child psychology there's nothing wrong with it it happens
[1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:55.720]  it's fine but this child psychology applies to liberal so just like when oh
[1:01:55.720 --> 1:02:00.480]  look our defunding the police is unpopular our defunding the police is
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:05.240]  leading to crime spikes let's just blame Republicans oh no those are the
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:09.080]  Republicans the Republicans in it it's the same thing with this kink stuff they
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:12.880]  realize now look our perversion our sexual perversion is now out in public
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:16.080]  it's not popular we're basically molesting children in public raping

[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:04.920]  vehicles and buses our crew has not gotten back yet I left at 6 a.m. and drove
[1:05:04.920 --> 1:05:10.800]  up here at about 90 miles an hour back to Austin from our fallen southern border
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:16.160]  that is all coming up but the raw footage of just part one yesterday is on
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:19.400]  Band-Aid video raw video reporters confront massive human smuggling
[1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:24.160]  operation during Trump border visit many of them little children not even with
[1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:29.960]  an accompanying parent so that is all coming up but here's what happened
[1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:41.480]  previously in the last few months before we give you the latest update on
[1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:47.240]  January 20th 2021 the globalist puppet Joe Biden was installed as president
[1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:51.800]  since then info wars has traveled to the US Texas border more than five times to
[1:05:51.800 --> 1:05:56.520]  document the planned implosion and invasion of our country human smuggling
[1:05:56.520 --> 1:06:01.360]  on a scale never foreseen because remember candidate Biden said if I win
[1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:06.480]  surge the border what I would do as president several more things I would in
[1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:11.200]  fact make sure that there is we immediately served to the border all
[1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:14.840]  those people are seeking asylum they deserve to be heard that's who we are
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:18.560]  where a nation says if you want to flee and they're fleeing oppression you
[1:06:18.560 --> 1:06:22.880]  should come thanks to info wars listeners and viewers we have been able to
[1:06:22.880 --> 1:06:27.120]  spotlight the implosion of our border and bring massive attention to it now
[1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:31.520]  president Trump governor Greg Abbott and others are traveling the Texas border to
[1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:36.760]  bring an even bigger spotlight to this crisis and force Joe Biden to stop the
[1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:41.360]  invasion of the United States so share the live feeds and share our videos and
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:45.400]  articles of the information the globalist hope the world never discovers
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:48.840]  because of the world discovers their human trafficking their drug trafficking
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:53.280]  and their criminal activity they are going down info wars live coverage of
[1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:57.960]  president Trump's visit to the US Mexico border live in South Texas only at
[1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:19.960]  freeworldnews.tv
[1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:38.400]  all right we are again back into hour number two I wanted to dovetail though
[1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:42.560]  and shroyer's ride the shotgun with me post the war on 3 p.m. weekdays I wanted
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:47.840]  to dovetail oh and all we just covered the last few segments with another FBI
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:51.920]  agent arrested for raping under 13 year old children seems to be happening every
[1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:55.240]  couple days now just a couple times Louisiana the last few months and the
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:08:00.040]  fact that they've infiltrated every institution and and now they're saying
[1:08:00.040 --> 1:08:03.240]  drag queen story time convicted pedophiles will be mandatory the
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:06.440]  military's training this I mean this is their religion this is their cult
[1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:09.800]  takeover and then at least a tenfold increase and the number of people being
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:13.640]  smuggled the board patrol whistleblower talked to us and said that it's two
[1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:16.880]  million that they're going to apprehend by fiscal year October it's over a
[1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:20.200]  million already they asked to make between three and five get away that they
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:26.760]  never saw so that's up to 10 million in one border sector alone in Texas this is
[1:08:26.760 --> 1:08:31.960]  off the charts compared to anything ever before seen this is the collapse of
[1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:38.000]  Central America and South America by the UN through the great reset lockdown no
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:43.280]  jobs no food forcing them up here this is a seismic event this is replacement
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:47.640]  migration the UN calling for 650 million to be brought to the United States by
[1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:52.280]  2050 they're actually doing it Owen I don't even know how to properly cover
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:56.360]  this really it's such in your face it's such bold criminal activity it's it's
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:59.920]  such against common sense and logic and reasoning it's like how do you even
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:05.360]  cover this is okay and the problem is liberals and Democrats just won't be
[1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:08.600]  honest they're just they're just liars about everything it'd be one thing if
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:11.920]  they were like yeah we want there to be an open border we don't want to matter I
[1:09:11.920 --> 1:09:15.680]  mean I guess they are being honest in a way but the ADL says if you talk about
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:18.680]  replacement migration which is the official UN policy you should be
[1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:22.400]  arrested by the way these are tyrants these are authoritarians the problem is
[1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.000]  the Republican leaders are weak need because they precondition none of this
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.800]  exist before they roll it out there is no world government there is no open
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:33.880]  borders there is no pedophilia and then once it's here people go well I'm not
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:37.000]  supposed to say that exists even though it exists see how the preconditioning
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.280]  works people have to get through the conditioning realize it's only gonna get
[1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:43.600]  worse they're gonna take everything you got until you start saying no so maybe
[1:09:43.600 --> 1:09:47.360]  we should just go with the big lies to oh there are no men in women's bathrooms
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:51.960]  there are no men on the podiums during you know women's sporting events there's
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:56.280]  no open border there's no child smuggling Hunter Biden isn't selling art for
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:10:00.640]  political influence Joe Biden didn't fire that prosecutor and withhold
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:05.560]  for Nate do it no I'll tell you what needs to happen the border patrol and
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:08.800]  even their head guys said this thing I fired has become the facilitator of the
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.720]  smuggling we need the border patrol to completely walk off because right now
[1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:16.760]  they're the ones that organize it and bring it across and actually ferry it
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:20.760]  these people can't even get through or find a bus or go anywhere unless the
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:25.160]  border patrol does it and so the border patrol needs to have a strike their
[1:10:25.160 --> 1:10:29.040]  union needs to call for it and you'll walk off because because they are
[1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:34.680]  facilitating the breach because it means it's it's insane this is a tough
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:38.720]  this is a tough thing to work out to because it gets to the larger issue of
[1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:42.240]  the fiat currency and how that's used to control us a new study came out it's
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:46.520]  now worse since the COVID obviously it's like they give the trillions of
[1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:51.280]  dollars that they issue a week to themselves but but I'm saying most
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:55.000]  Americans are still living paycheck to paycheck and so oh don't we don't get
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.960]  any of the money oh but if you're in if you can get to New York you're a legal
[1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:02.480]  alien you get $15,000 the day you get there but I'm saying for some border
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:05.800]  patrol agents probably going on strike and not getting that paycheck is not an
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:08.880]  option they've got families they've got mortgages they have things to do so it's
[1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:12.800]  the control over all of us the fiat currency slavery that we're all
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:15.920]  enduring right now but absolutely that'd be one thing border patrol could
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:18.920]  just walk off and say look we're not doing anything to protect the border all
[1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:21.760]  we're doing is facilitating human smuggling well that's the thing they're
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:25.640]  committing the crime helping smuggle and deliver the people to the NGOs of the
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:31.520]  UN and so they they must resign they must quit they must go no we look
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:36.680]  America needs to have a serious reconciliation with itself and just
[1:11:36.680 --> 1:11:41.320]  accept that what what what has happened here is is so criminal and out of
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:44.600]  control I mean I'm not calling for a constitutional convention but I mean
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:48.000]  there needs to be there needs to be some sort of reconciliation that we have
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:53.120]  and we have to just decide do we want to have a country or not because if we're
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:56.040]  if we if we don't want to fight for America then fine let the left take over
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:11:59.560]  let the Chinese communists take over they'll throw all of us in jail or if we
[1:11:59.560 --> 1:12:03.320]  do want to have a country and and we're seriously want to rot out all of this
[1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:08.040]  get out all of this rotten corruption how are we going to go about this it's
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:11.760]  not going to be easy or do we just kind of maybe just sit back Alex for a
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:15.280]  couple years and just let them run all of their stuff and let them commit all
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:18.120]  their crimes and open the borders and rape kids and all the stuff and then
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:21.920]  and then maybe America will be ready but by then total election probably a
[1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:24.840]  complete place and there'll be no there'll be a one-party system like
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:29.200]  Venezuela and it's all over so I guess that's that's where the the intellectual
[1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.920]  battle I mean Americans have to realize this is a scientific premeditated
[1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:39.320]  organized crime syndicate takeover I've got world economic forum documents they
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:42.160]  run the whole show they now admit they run the world government in their own
[1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:45.640]  words I'm gonna show you this next segment after Owen leaves it is huge
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:49.800]  there is so much to hit coming up and we've got a special guest who now has
[1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:53.920]  had her bank account taken away because she dared run for Congress and and of
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:58.440]  course Congress does nothing about that but Owen tell me a lot's gonna happen
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:01.680]  between now and the war room at 3 p.m. Central but what do you got coming up on
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:06.520]  your own show we've got Jesse Lee Peterson joining us of course he's very
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:09.240]  influential it's the start of white history month so he'll be telling us
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:13.480]  about that we've got Norm Pattison to talk about three things the Cosby case
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.240]  the Brittany case and then the one that really scares him the fact that it's now
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:22.240]  being politicized the bar the bar which is what you have to pass you have to
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:25.720]  pass to get into the to be a lawyer they're now removing people like Rudy
[1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:30.000]  Giuliani's law license because he supports Trump so now being a lawyer is
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.680]  politicized Alex so what's next you can't be a doctor unless you love
[1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:35.920]  vaccines you can't be a lawyer unless you love the new world order so no
[1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:40.120]  political litmus test I can't wait Jesse Lee Peterson is gonna do white
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:44.680]  history month for us on air and Norm Pattison on all these big court cases

[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:02.760]  Lend and
[1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:04.760]  show.
[1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:55.040]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen we have a special guest who dared run for
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:56.040]  Congress.
[1:16:56.040 --> 1:17:07.040]  Had her bank account taken away, that's a fuck crime, you don't run as a Republican under your corporate dictatorship, but before we do that I'm going to hit this now and get more into it in the next hour because it's a big deal.
[1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:20.040]  When you see all these articles with the Washington Post saying pedophilia is good and the sexualization of children and men coming into women's bathrooms and saying I want to have sex with you as long as they're transgender, they're God, they're allowed to do it.
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:47.040]  When you see all this and you wonder why it's happening, well it's because Klaus Schwab, who headed up the UN biological diversity system, which is really the UN, has written a bunch of books saying we're going to end the nuclear family, we're going to make humans obsolete, and we're going to face humans out to 500 million a manageable number.
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:18:02.040]  That's why you see all these HBO and Amazon TV shows where there's a terrorist who learns really a hero and they explain there's too many people, we're hurting the earth and we're going to cut things down to 500 million.
[1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:26.040]  All these different shows, from Zardaz back in the 70s to Utopia 2020 to Utopia 2013, hundreds of shows tell you what's on the Georgia Guidestones because they give these production companies talking points and they say we want films produced with these talking points.
[1:18:26.040 --> 1:18:33.040]  And then you find out at the end, oh, they're heroes depopulating us.
[1:18:33.040 --> 1:18:38.040]  And they even tell you how they do it through the vaccines and through the fluoride.
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:19:03.040]  So there's a new article out, World Economic Forum pledges to censor health misinformation and anti-vaccine content, and that means not letting you know about cures for viral infections, not letting you know that putting respirators on people with COVID kills them, not letting you hear from chief scientists and heads of universities and major whistleblowers from inside Big Pharma that hey, this vaccine will sterilize you.
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:12.040]  What it is, is things they don't want known, just like Google and Facebook and others, were invested in the Wuhan lab in this very virus. Everybody wanted to be involved in this.
[1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:22.040]  You've got to get everybody involved in the black magic. You've got to get them all involved in the black Sabbath.
[1:19:22.040 --> 1:19:31.040]  Like why do you get 100 men and women together to go with a kidnapped baby that's three years old, rape them and torture them and drink their blood slowly over a day in a dungeon?
[1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:38.040]  That's what Satanists do, because it's very bonding to have sex while you torture a little girl or boy to death for these sickos.
[1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:42.040]  Well now they're torturing and killing us all on a wide scale.
[1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:48.040]  And now they're injecting our children with a vaccine that all the scientists say won't protect them and hurt them.
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:53.040]  Why would you do that when it's not even a vaccine? Because it's an act of Satanism.
[1:19:53.040 --> 1:20:01.040]  World Economic Forum pledges to censor misinformation, health information and anti-vaccine content. That's a quote.
[1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:09.040]  Just if you say these things are a fraud of a bad history, well you're not allowed to, because the World Economic Forum said so.
[1:20:09.040 --> 1:20:15.040]  That's the public Bilderberg group. That's the corporate governance system that set up the UN that runs it.
[1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:19.040]  And they're the ones that decide the lockdowns. They're the ones that decide the vaccine passports.
[1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:23.040]  They're the ones that think they're going to force you to comply and they're going to surveil you and control you.
[1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:25.040]  They're the enemy.
[1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:30.040]  Koss Schwab is Hitler 2.0, twice grandfather at work for Hitler.
[1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:36.040]  And here it is, advanced digital safety, a framework to align global action.
[1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:41.040]  White paper. World Economic Forum just put out three days ago.
[1:20:41.040 --> 1:20:46.040]  And I read it. It's how global boards will decide what you can and can't publish.
[1:20:46.040 --> 1:20:56.040]  Down to your newspaper, down to your website, they'll all decide with armies of leftist trains at universities who will now surveil and dominate everyone.
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:00.040]  But it's all about safety, of course.
[1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:06.040]  And the need for public-private cooperation, the corporations with government doing all this.
[1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:09.040]  Yes, that's called fascism. That's the definition of it.
[1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:19.040]  And then this newest paper, Global Governance Toolkit for Digital Mental Health Building Trust in Disruptive Technology for Mental Health.
[1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:24.040]  They say, oh, our technology, our takeover, our end of the family is going to wreck their mental health.
[1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:28.040]  So now we've got to take control of them and help them now that we've destroyed them.
[1:21:28.040 --> 1:21:32.040]  But really, that's just making you more depressed, more control.
[1:21:32.040 --> 1:21:39.040]  With their disruptive post-human takeover, what they're going to make you feel good and enjoy and love your servitude is exactly what they get into.
[1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.040]  Global Governance.
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:46.040]  Global Government Toolkit, meaning Weapon System, Control System.
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:49.040]  I read the whole thing.
[1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:51.040]  Go read it for yourself.
[1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.040]  And then now you see it in action.
[1:21:53.040 --> 1:21:57.040]  Federal Judge blocks Florida, social media law, blocks to FANTAS.
[1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:01.040]  Trying to say you can't censor people or political candidates.
[1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:04.040]  So they're saying, no, we can censor who we want politically and we will.
[1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:07.040]  And all over the world, Facebook does.
[1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:19.040]  Meanwhile, Trudeau, who wants to be a communist dictator in his own words, has introduced the worst censorship law of any Western democracy, word for word, what is in the Davos Group.
[1:22:19.040 --> 1:22:21.040]  But he waited till they released it.
[1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:22.040]  So he's under orders.
[1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:24.040]  He's a colonel.
[1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:28.040]  And there's generals and field marshals above him.
[1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:29.040]  And it was a field marshal.
[1:22:29.040 --> 1:22:37.040]  He had lots of generals, but the field marshal is in command of the war, command of the battle.
[1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:40.040]  Trudeau is just a colonel, not even a general.
[1:22:40.040 --> 1:22:44.040]  He reads a teleprompter and all of it comes out of Klaus Schwab.
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:47.040]  All of it comes out of the global governance.
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:51.040]  It's all right there.
[1:22:51.040 --> 1:22:52.040]  Republicans fight it.
[1:22:52.040 --> 1:22:53.040]  Federal judges overturn it.
[1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:59.040]  Trudeau rams it through total submission and what does the provincial leaders say?
[1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:04.040]  We're keeping locked down martial law in place so that you can't spread this information.
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:08.040]  It's all an exercise of only our information gets out.
[1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:12.040]  And we're the ones that cooked up the virus and brought it to you and now bring you the deadly vaccine.
[1:23:12.040 --> 1:23:20.040]  And we're going to sit there and kill you with it and watch you take it and watch leftist line up and say, we're letting them experiment on our newborn baby with it.
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:24.040]  Because we're heroes. We're leftist. We're in the cult.
[1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:26.040]  We're in the club.
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:31.040]  We're showing how we'll give our humanity up to carry this out.
[1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:34.040]  That's why they're trying to shut us down, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:36.040]  That's why you can't let them.
[1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:45.040]  It's such an act of resistance to go buy a t-shirt and to wear it and spread the word like a free americaninfowars.com shirt in camo in navy blue and in black.
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:51.040]  It's such a revolutionary act to get the supplements and the vitamins and the minerals that are so incredible.
[1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:53.040]  We have all the highest grade out there.
[1:23:53.040 --> 1:23:59.040]  It's so revolutionary when they bombard you with fluoride and bromide and bromine, all the bad halogens to go, oh, what do they not want me to have?
[1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:01.040]  The good halogen.
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:05.040]  But the government used to put in the fall to have high IQ and health and not get cancer.
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:10.040]  Oh, but instead they don't want you to know about that.
[1:24:10.040 --> 1:24:12.040]  Iodine's one of the biggest deficiencies out there.
[1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:15.040]  We have the best cleanest systems, two different formulas. They're both excellent.
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:18.040]  X2 and X3, they're both two different formulas.
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:20.040]  One is not better than the other.
[1:24:20.040 --> 1:24:21.040]  X2 is 50% off.
[1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:22.040]  We have a limited supply.
[1:24:22.040 --> 1:24:24.040]  I got a big shipment of X3 in.
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:29.040]  It's 60% off, $16 unprecedented low with double patriot points and free shipping.
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:31.040]  That is basically a loss leader.
[1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:33.040]  And I'm going to sell it out at current sales rates.
[1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:34.040]  It'll be gone in a week.
[1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:46.040]  You've got until Sunday to get your orders in for X3 or X2 with the free shipping and the huge discounts at infowarstore.com or triple A 253 3139.
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:53.040]  All right, our special guest, I'll tell you about on the other side, she has had her bank account taken away.
[1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:55.040]  So everyone should shut up and submit or they'll get you next.
[1:24:55.040 --> 1:24:56.040]  No submitting bills.
[1:24:56.040 --> 1:24:59.040]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:05.040]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:06.040]  It hurts.
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:07.040]  It stinks.
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:09.040]  It's got pus coming out of it.
[1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:10.040]  I go to the doctor.
[1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:11.040]  They fix it.
[1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:12.040]  That's not negative.
[1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:13.040]  I'm not living in denial.
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:19.040]  And so think of globalism as being hidden as an infection that we feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[1:25:19.040 --> 1:25:21.040]  That's actually a positive thing.
[1:25:21.040 --> 1:25:23.040]  And so yeah, Trump did an overall great job.
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:24.040]  They stole the election.
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:26.040]  We can't get down about that.
[1:25:26.040 --> 1:25:30.040]  We have forced them out in the open.
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:34.040]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:35.040]  They're scared.
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:37.040]  That's why instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers.
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:38.040]  Look what happened.
[1:25:38.040 --> 1:25:39.040]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[1:25:39.040 --> 1:25:40.040]  They're trying to suppress us.
[1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:44.040]  Let our light of proof shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[1:25:44.040 --> 1:25:48.040]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:52.040]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're an information war.
[1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:59.040]  We're going to win this together and the fight starts at implores.com.
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:04.040]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:12.040]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:22.040]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:28.040]  Orson slaves are just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be
[1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:34.040]  servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:39.040]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:26:39.040 --> 1:26:44.040]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:45.040]  It's that choice.
[1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:48.040]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:26:48.040 --> 1:26:52.040]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:27:21.040]  It is a spiritual battle and implores at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:50.040]  We're going to win this together.
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:28:16.040]  We're going to win this together.
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:42.040]  We're going to win this together.
[1:28:42.040 --> 1:29:08.040]  We're going to win this together.
[1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:34.040]  What we're witnessing is a global corporate government that wants dumbed down, confused,
[1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:39.040]  lost, alone sheep to go to any leftist event.
[1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:43.040]  It looks like you've been dropped in the middle of a mental institution.
[1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:44.040]  And it's very, very sad.
[1:29:44.040 --> 1:29:47.040]  They're incompetent and they want to take us over.
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:48.040]  They want to make us their slaves.
[1:29:48.040 --> 1:29:50.040]  But above them is Klaus Schwab and the Globalist.
[1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:52.040]  I just showed you their own public documents.
[1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:56.040]  They released about we're going to control all speech through corporations, through government.
[1:29:56.040 --> 1:30:00.040]  We're going to have non-governmental boards that decide what speech you can have and who
[1:30:00.040 --> 1:30:01.040]  can have a website.
[1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:04.040]  So, oh, first they kick you off the major platforms.
[1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:09.040]  Now, they want GAB taken down, whether it's the ADL, the Southern Private Law Center,
[1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:15.040]  or the Davos group that says the new revolution is going to be taking over our bodies and
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:19.040]  sterilizing us and depopulating us and we'll own nothing, we'll have nothing.
[1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:24.040]  And a report I shot a week ago in New York that we still haven't put out because we've
[1:30:24.040 --> 1:30:27.040]  been so busy and it's so amazing, should air tomorrow.
[1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:29.040]  It's almost done.
[1:30:29.040 --> 1:30:33.040]  We've added a lot to it, a lot of clips and documentation.
[1:30:33.040 --> 1:30:37.040]  But we went to the UN building and this could be its own story.
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:44.040]  It had giant placards saying you will soon live like this and it shows dungeons in like
[1:30:44.040 --> 1:30:48.040]  a barren field and it said you will live in a commune and own nothing and have nothing.
[1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:50.040]  And then we went to Pfizer and it had similar things.
[1:30:50.040 --> 1:30:52.040]  I mean, this is, you're going to love it.
[1:30:52.040 --> 1:30:53.040]  You'll own nothing.
[1:30:53.040 --> 1:30:56.040]  You'll have no family and you're not going to be a human and there's no mommy or daddy
[1:30:56.040 --> 1:31:00.040]  anymore and there's no Jesus and there's no money and there's nothing.
[1:31:00.040 --> 1:31:02.040]  It's liberal.
[1:31:02.040 --> 1:31:05.040]  I mean, this is satanic folks.
[1:31:05.040 --> 1:31:07.040]  And then the Washington Post saying pedophilia is good.
[1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:10.040]  Take your children to kink events, take them to topless bars.
[1:31:10.040 --> 1:31:12.040]  It's all illegal.
[1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:17.040]  But they want to get the children young so they can screw them up like they were.
[1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:21.040]  These are abused people sexually who are now, can't replicate.
[1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:25.040]  They don't have children so instead they get our children and psychologically rape them.
[1:31:25.040 --> 1:31:33.040]  Lauren whiskey has been a guest frequently on shows here at info or she's been with us before as well.
[1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:39.040]  I see her prolific work all over the place doing a great job just standing up for freedom.
[1:31:39.040 --> 1:31:44.040]  She's a spokeswoman for hold the line pack and former Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate.
[1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:50.040]  She smashed the record in most Republican votes for the Senate candidate in Delaware history outside of politics.
[1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:56.040]  She's been an addiction recovery in her passion and is an active volunteer in recovery ministry.
[1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:02.040]  Lauren whiskey DE on gab and you need to follow her there because she's lost her bank account.
[1:32:02.040 --> 1:32:09.040]  Financial blacklisting Wells Fargo shuts down GOP Senate candidate Lauren whiskey's bank account.
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:13.040]  How dare you try to have a how dare you.
[1:32:13.040 --> 1:32:16.040]  She says she will be pursuing legal action against Wells Fargo.
[1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:18.040]  We're fighting back.
[1:32:18.040 --> 1:32:20.040]  Where is Congress fighting back.
[1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:22.040]  This is Nazi Germany stuff.
[1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:24.040]  First thing Hitler did was take the Jews bank accounts.
[1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:26.040]  But now the 80 else says they want to do that.
[1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:28.040]  I'm really sad and scared.
[1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:30.040]  I thought Hitler was bad.
[1:32:30.040 --> 1:32:31.040]  Lauren, thank you for joining us.
[1:32:31.040 --> 1:32:33.040]  Give us the latest on what's happened to you.
[1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:34.040]  Hey, Alex.
[1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:36.040]  Thanks so much for having me back on.
[1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:43.040]  So listen, it's no coincidence that they did this to me the same day that I exposed the equality act.
[1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:50.040]  I'm filling in for true news host Rick Wiles and I went on their show and I talked about the equality act.
[1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:52.040]  Now there is a war on Christians.
[1:32:52.040 --> 1:32:53.040]  They did this.
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:33:01.040]  They targeted me and they made an example out of me because I'm an outspoken Christian who vocally opposes the equality act.
[1:33:01.040 --> 1:33:09.040]  Listen, I don't know if you know much about it, but they're about to they're trying to illegalize Jesus Christ and the scripture and categorize.
[1:33:09.040 --> 1:33:10.040]  Absolutely.
[1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:14.040]  And you're up in Canada where they're arresting pastors. Tell folks about it.
[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:15.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:22.040]  So what it will do is it will classify scripture, belief and traditional marriage as hate speech.
[1:33:22.040 --> 1:33:35.040]  If an abortionist chooses not to wants to make the decision to not perform an abortion, they can arrest that abortionist or that doctor or that nurse that chooses to take the biblical approach and change their lives.
[1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:37.040]  Children who struggle with gender identity.
[1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:42.040]  Now that it's going to make him illegal for them to pursue therapy to change their mind.
[1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:44.040]  And this is, I mean, it's absolutely.
[1:33:44.040 --> 1:33:49.040]  It's basically the cult trying to make it illegal to leave the cult.
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:50.040]  Yes, exactly.
[1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:55.040]  And even just quoting scripture will be classified as hate speech is what it is going to do.
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:33:59.040]  It is going to make Christianity a crime on a federal level.
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:07.040]  And I went on TV and I exposed this and I was talking about how there's Republicans like Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, Nancy Mace from South Carolina.
[1:34:07.040 --> 1:34:14.040]  They are working with the Democrats to make the Equality Act more palatable for Republicans to accept right now.
[1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:16.040]  We vehemently oppose the Equality Act.
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:21.040]  It's not going to pass, but they're working together to make it sound better to get it passed.
[1:34:21.040 --> 1:34:23.040]  Let me tell you something, Alex.
[1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:32.040]  This entire stolen election, everything was to place Joe Biden to push the Equality Act on the American people because they know it is Christians.
[1:34:32.040 --> 1:34:33.040]  They know it is the church.
[1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:52.040]  They're the only thing standing in the way before the were the only wall standing in the way between a full communist takeover and they are trying to make us illegal and they are attacking us and they took down my bank account the same day I talked about this because they were getting heat from the Democrats.
[1:34:52.040 --> 1:35:01.040]  Wells Fargo was getting heat from the Democrats for donating to Republicans like Mitch McConnell, who allegedly opposed the Equality Act.
[1:35:01.040 --> 1:35:07.040]  But Mitch McConnell is their token GOP member because he's, you know, a moderate.
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:12.040]  However, they are working behind the scenes to pass the Equality Act with just different verbiage.
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:13.040]  Oh, I've seen big articles.
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:24.040]  I've seen big articles in Newsweek, the New York Times, you name it, saying outlaw Republicans from fundraising if they oppose this Equality Act.
[1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:26.040]  So it's the litmus test.
[1:35:26.040 --> 1:35:27.040]  It's the hate speech law.
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:33.040]  It's all the tyranny we see at universities, all the tyranny we see in the UK now actually in the Civil Rights Act.
[1:35:33.040 --> 1:35:39.040]  It would amend the Civil Rights Act and say you can't say something that hurts somebody else's feelings.
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:44.040]  Yes, absolutely. You can't even quote scripture because it's hate speech.
[1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:47.040]  They will federally illegalize it and throw you in prison.
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:54.040]  They're going to throw hundreds of thousands of pastors in prison should they not want to perform gay marriages.
[1:35:54.040 --> 1:36:02.040]  You know, we as Christians that Christian Baker was just fine $500 for not wanting to bake the tyranny cake.
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:12.040]  You know, how is it that they can force Christians to bake the cake, but we can't force Wells Fargo, come big banks like Wells Fargo to serve as Christians.
[1:36:12.040 --> 1:36:13.040]  You know, this was a targeted attack.
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  I talked to employees at Wells Fargo who have poured through my account.
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:20.040]  They are like, we have no idea.
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:22.040]  This is Lauren Whiskey buying groceries.
[1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:24.040]  There's no criminal activity whatsoever.
[1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:29.040]  But it was my entire, you know, life savings in there and they threw it to loss prevention.
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:32.040]  I still haven't gotten all the money in my account yet.
[1:36:32.040 --> 1:36:35.040]  They sent a check. It hasn't cleared yet. I'm still waiting.
[1:36:35.040 --> 1:36:38.040]  They left me stranded and they knew I was.
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:40.040]  Hold on a second.
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:42.040]  I'm fighting back.
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:44.040]  I'm glad you're fighting back while your Skype clears up.
[1:36:44.040 --> 1:36:47.040]  I'm going to come back the next segment and talk about how you're fighting back.
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:49.040]  This is the global social credit score.
[1:36:49.040 --> 1:36:55.040]  It's why they want a casual society, but they only want big corporations so they can blacklist you if you don't do what they want.
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:36:59.040]  But first it's, oh, except gay marriage and then it's, oh, except drag queen storytime.
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:04.040]  And then, oh, it's except sending your children to pedophile training and sterilization.
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:05.040]  That's the end game.
[1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:07.040]  They admitted it's about depopulation.
[1:37:07.040 --> 1:37:08.040]  Your skype's back now.
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:11.040]  You were saying you're fighting back.
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:12.040]  Yes, we are.
[1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:14.040]  So I have a lawyer.
[1:37:14.040 --> 1:37:15.040]  His name's John Mullen.
[1:37:15.040 --> 1:37:19.040]  He actually represented Simone Papadopoulos during the Mueller trials.
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:26.040]  He is, he is going to be looking into this and representing me on behalf of all Christians.
[1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:27.040]  I'm fighting back.
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:30.040]  You know, we cannot allow this to go any further.
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:31.040]  We're going to lose everything.
[1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.040]  If we give our enemy an inch, he's going to take the whole thing.
[1:37:34.040 --> 1:37:39.040]  As you've seen now, you've watched as the slow fade has happened and we have allowed it to happen.
[1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:47.040]  And it's gotten to the point now where we're all going to end up in Kamala's gulags unless we all stand up together and fight back as Christians.
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:51.040]  And that, that is why, you know, I could have just let it slide.
[1:37:51.040 --> 1:37:55.040]  I don't really want to get involved in all this, but also I have to do it.
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:37:57.040]  I have to stand up and I have to fight back.
[1:37:57.040 --> 1:38:03.040]  Congressman Paul Gosar from Arizona is the only Republican in office who has stood up for me.
[1:38:03.040 --> 1:38:09.040]  He called for a federal investigation into Wells Fargo for what they did to me, you know, because they have no evidence of any criminal activity.
[1:38:09.040 --> 1:38:16.040]  I have been a client with Wells Fargo for years and I haven't even overdrawn my account.
[1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:17.040]  I haven't even once.
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:22.040]  There was absolutely no reason for them to do this to me, aside from my political beliefs.
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:25.040]  Well, I mean, I had, I had major banks in Texas.
[1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:26.040]  I never made a big deal about this.
[1:38:26.040 --> 1:38:27.040]  It's a level to celebrate it.
[1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:33.040]  But banks we had for 20 years say, no, because you're supported Trump, you know, that they, they took those accounts away.
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:35.040]  And this is the future for everybody.
[1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:39.040]  It's why we've got to build our own accounts, build our own economy, come out of Babylon.
[1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:40.040]  That's what they really fear.
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:42.040]  They want to instead make us submit.
[1:38:42.040 --> 1:38:47.040]  There's no amount of submission until you kill yourself that makes the Satanic system happy.
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:48.040]  That's what it wants.
[1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:51.040]  We'll talk about how you're fighting back and Joe Biden's big announcement he just made.
[1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:53.040]  I'll tell you about it on the other side.
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:38:56.040]  It's bad news.
[1:38:56.040 --> 1:39:04.040]  The most important thing I've done in the last eight years for my health, for a middle clarity, for my focus has been deep birth crystal iodide.
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:11.040]  Dr. Group hammered me and hammered me nine, 10 years ago and said, Alex, you've got to start taking deep birth crystal atomic iodide.
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:15.040]  And when I finally started taking it, it changed my life.
[1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:23.040]  Even the UN's own health website admits over 2 million people have cognitive disabilities lower IQ because of lack of iodide.
[1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:26.040]  Well, we have two varieties of high quality iodide.
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:29.040]  It'll blow you away on sale right now.
[1:39:29.040 --> 1:39:35.040]  X2, there's deep breath crystal iodide and X3, there's tri iodide, deep breath crystal iodide and two other types.
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:37.040]  Some people need all three types of absorption.
[1:39:37.040 --> 1:39:41.040]  So it's apples and oranges, two different formulas, some people like one better or the other.
[1:39:41.040 --> 1:39:44.040]  But the point is, they're all discolored right now.
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:51.040]  50% off for X2, 60% off for X3, with free shipping, double patriot points through the fourth of July.

[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:03.040]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:40:03.040 --> 1:40:07.040]  But let me tell you, the new world orders breathe them down our neck.
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:11.040]  The big globalist publications are coming after us and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.

[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:35.040]  I want to keep fighting the globalist, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:40.040]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can,

[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:22.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:34.040]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:41.040]  The only question you should have is, how bad is it going to get until we say no and push back?
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:47.040]  Can you imagine, with our special guests, a great lady doing a wonderful job appearing all over national TV,
[1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:52.040]  all over the internet, all over talk radio, well-spoken, great Christian, people-lover,
[1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:57.040]  and they are trying to shut her down and take her bank account away, Lauren Whiskey.
[1:43:57.040 --> 1:44:00.040]  And she's on Gab at Lauren Whiskey DE.
[1:44:00.040 --> 1:44:04.040]  We're going to be talking to her about how we fight back against this tyranny in a moment.
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:10.040]  But first, what was the headline I wrote this morning at 10.30 before we went live?
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:20.040]  Thursday live, UN-controlled Davos Group pushes new lockdowns, citing Delta Plus variant line.
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:25.040]  They're the UN. They gave the order. What just broke 20 minutes ago?
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:30.040]  Just in, White House had deployed Delta variant response teams to go to the media
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:34.040]  and wear hazmat suits and scare everyone across the United States.
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:37.040]  They'll have some actors fall down on their faces.
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:42.040]  Lockdown twos are coming. China's got to win the economic war. We've got to be locked down.
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:48.040]  White House to deploy response teams focused on combating Delta variant of COVID-19.
[1:44:48.040 --> 1:44:53.040]  Oh, a new enemy, even more scary.
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:57.040]  The Biden administration is set to announce Thursday that's deploying response teams across the U.S.
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:04.040]  to high, to U.S. areas with high spread of the highly contagious Delta variant CNN says.
[1:45:04.040 --> 1:45:08.040]  But they admit it's not. It's all made up and it's pure garbage.
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:13.040]  But see, the Davos Group said, oh, they're going to crack down on who's allowed to talk about anything.
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:19.040]  You're not allowed to have a opinion online. The Davos Group at the UN said they're in charge of what you can and can't say.
[1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:24.040]  So they started censoring me years ago. Now they're after everybody else.
[1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:33.040]  We've got to organize. We've got to say now we've got to get the churches who are busy running their LBGTP stuff with these flags about inclusion.
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:37.040]  It's about exclusion. It's about taking over the churches, taking over the women's sports.
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:41.040]  It's about taking over all convention as a form of dominance.
[1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:44.040]  Not even the mafia would make you cut your son's genitals off.
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:49.040]  But they demand that as a sign of submission or an experimental deadly shot.
[1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:52.040]  It's a sign of total submission or wear a mask over your face.
[1:45:52.040 --> 1:45:56.040]  It's a total cult posing again as liberal.
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:45:58.040]  And we need where are the churches?
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:07.040]  If you start going to these big churches and you start demanding people expose the dangerous vaccines or you start exposing that the less taking away free speech, they're authoritarian.
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:13.040]  The churches will stop groveling. Most of these churches and institutions aren't on board with evil. They're just being bullied.
[1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:15.040]  What do you say to that, Lauren?
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:19.040]  Absolutely. But also they've been cowardly. They've been spineless.
[1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:25.040]  They've been so afraid of the evil vile people who hate us and want us dead, calling them names.
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:29.040]  So they have refused to speak out against things like gay marriage.
[1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:33.040]  And now look at this. What do we have? What have we seen all last month?
[1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:36.040]  You know, 10 years ago we talked about the slippery slope.
[1:46:36.040 --> 1:46:39.040]  Churches remain silent and did nothing because we were being called bigots.
[1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:44.040]  We were getting pressure. But in the end, we saw that the end goal was always the children.
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:50.040]  We watched as the last month they just normalize pedophilia.
[1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:56.040]  They're pushing that normalization of pedophilia in children's shows. Drag queens on blues clues.
[1:46:56.040 --> 1:47:03.040]  Like pedophile paraphernalia all over this little clip in blues clues.
[1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:07.040]  Oh, they have the pedophile flag on the show. The pedophile flag.
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:10.040]  Yes, they did. And they're not even hiding it anymore.
[1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:15.040]  Where is the church? The church has said nothing because they didn't want to be involved politically.
[1:47:15.040 --> 1:47:20.040]  Well, guess what? They're coming for us all and we need our churches to stand up against this.
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:31.040]  In regard to the vaccine, Alex, did you know that LifeSite just published an article revealing that the vaccine has an 82% miscarriage rate?
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:35.040]  Why is nobody talking about this? It's a depopulation agenda.
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:41.040]  This new variant, they're going to be pushing fear on the American people again and censoring information about these deadly vaccines.
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:46.040]  And 82% of women are having miscarriages. It's killing babies.
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:55.040]  The Democrats, they love dead babies. They love nothing more than planned parenthood and vaccines that kill little babies in the womb.
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:58.040]  And the church is going to have to make a decision at some point.
[1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:04.040]  They're going to either have to stand up or wait to be destroyed because that is what is going to happen.
[1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:12.040]  I've been desperately calling on the church to step up, especially on issues like abortion, like gay marriage, like this Equality Act.
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:16.040]  And everybody's afraid. I don't understand why everybody is so afraid.
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:22.040]  If you knew what was coming, what kind of times were in, you'd do everything you could to fight for your people.
[1:48:22.040 --> 1:48:27.040]  It's coming. It's always been about, we knew Christian persecution was coming.
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:32.040]  You've talked about this for years, the goal of the globalist agenda, but it's here now.
[1:48:32.040 --> 1:48:39.040]  And we allowed it to get this far and we have to start, instead of just playing on defense, we have got to start taking back territory.
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:46.040]  We have to be bold voices for righteousness. We have to be bold voices for Jesus Christ and everything he stands for.
[1:48:46.040 --> 1:48:54.040]  The literal instructions on how to defeat this is right in his word and they are trying to illegalize his word.
[1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:58.040]  Isn't that amazing that 2,000 years ago we were specifically warned about all this?
[1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:02.040]  And here's the new big study, naturalnews.com. It's also on infowars.com.
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:10.040]  Population, depopulation, alert. Shocking new study reveals COVID vaccine terminates 4 out of 5 pregnancies.
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:16.040]  I know medical doctors that say all the women that were pregnant that took it, the babies died via spontaneous abortions.
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:20.040]  That's what top scientists last year warned the vaccines would do.
[1:49:20.040 --> 1:49:27.040]  A shocking new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that pregnant women are given COVID vaccinations during their first
[1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:34.040]  or second trial measures. They suffer an 82% spontaneous abortion rate, killing 4 out of 5 unborn babies.
[1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:40.040]  They don't just want to rape them, they want to kill them. Incredible information, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:46.040]  Yeah, absolutely. You know, Satan, he knows that the easiest way to destroy something is when it's in seed form.
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:51.040]  That's why they try to murder babies in the womb. After, if they're lucky enough to survive...
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:53.040]  They got a fighting chance.
[1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:59.040]  Yes, but after that, then they try to indoctrinate these children by smearing their identities.
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:03.040]  We don't really know if you're a boy or a girl. Hey, you're a boy that identifies as a girl.
[1:50:03.040 --> 1:50:07.040]  Let's encourage that to the point where they want to commit suicide.
[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:15.040]  I mean, 40% of them end up committing suicide, attempting suicide, ruining their lives, spending the rest of their lives depressed.
[1:50:15.040 --> 1:50:21.040]  And remember, the groups that want us to abort our babies, and all of us, the ones saying, take this shot, we want to save you.
[1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:27.040]  Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you. He's the one coming out saying, please take this shot, I love you.
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:31.040]  But this new journal, this new New England medical journal, this is prestigious.
[1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:34.040]  It's what I've already been told by medical doctors, they're too scared to come on.
[1:50:34.040 --> 1:50:40.040]  This is crimes against humanity, and notice they're now trying to give it to newborn babies.
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:46.040]  And they have liberals seeing and celebrating some lining up to volunteer their children for medical experimentation.
[1:50:46.040 --> 1:50:48.040]  What a cult of sick freaks.
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:55.040]  Yeah. And they're having children. You know, there's no reason for little children to be taking these vaccines, healthy children.
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:51:04.040]  And it's not even just that. Pregnant moms who are around other people who are about, who have been vaccinated due to the protein shedding, they're losing their babies, too.
[1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:06.040]  So you may not even be vaccinated.
[1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:10.040]  This is a holocaust with Warren Witzke. I'd like to invite you sometime.
[1:51:10.040 --> 1:51:16.040]  We'd love to fly you down to Texas on our dime so you can be in studio with us in the HD.
[1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:21.040]  Please tell my producer when you want to come down for two days in the next month, if you can do it, to make the rounds here.
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:24.040]  We want to support you. Lauren Witzke DE on GAB.
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:27.040]  Witzke is W-I-T-Z-K-E-D-E.
[1:51:27.040 --> 1:51:30.040]  God bless you. How do people find you? How do they support you?
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:36.040]  Yeah. Alex, thank you so much for having me on. You can follow me at Lauren Witzke DE on GAB.
[1:51:36.040 --> 1:51:39.040]  I've been banned from Twitter for calling out the Pettos.
[1:51:39.040 --> 1:51:49.040]  If you want to join my fight in fighting against the Equality Act, electing America First Conservatives who are going to say no, Christian America First Conservatives who are going to say no,
[1:51:49.040 --> 1:51:58.040]  to these establishment hacks like Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, and actually fight for Christianity, please support my fight at hold the line pack.com.
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:04.040]  Again, Alex, thank you so much. I appreciate you. I appreciate your audience. I love you guys. Keep praying.
[1:52:04.040 --> 1:52:09.040]  Hey, I feel good knowing you're there. That URL one more time.
[1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:10.040]  I'm sorry?
[1:52:10.040 --> 1:52:12.040]  The URL for folks who support what you're doing.
[1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:18.040]  Oh, yeah. Hold the line pack.com. Just, you know, there, that's where I'm fighting the fight.
[1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:21.040]  I'm raising money to elect America First Conservatives.
[1:52:21.040 --> 1:52:26.040]  Absolutely. The enemy is trying to shut you down. We got to support you. Lauren, talk to you again soon. Come see us if you want.
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:33.040]  Okay. Boom. I'm going to hit this giant New England medical journal thing that she was just bringing up that I had right here in the stack.
[1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:38.040]  That is next hour. And I also intend to hit all this other news and hopefully have time to open the phones up.
[1:52:38.040 --> 1:52:46.040]  We're going to break them right back. Speaking of support, we're a mothership that has all these great activists on that are the salty earth that we ask you to support.
[1:52:46.040 --> 1:52:51.040]  But if the mothership isn't here, we're in trouble and they're working around the clock to take us down.
[1:52:51.040 --> 1:52:54.040]  We're not going to give it attention. We're not going to whine. We're God's hands.
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:58.040]  But God put us in full wars in your hands. God works through you.
[1:52:58.040 --> 1:53:05.040]  That's the info or store.com today. You have a be a sponsor. Donate button right there at the top $5, $10, $20.
[1:53:05.040 --> 1:53:12.040]  You can sign up for a recurring or just one time gift. That's pure money that helps us fund the operation or buy the products.
[1:53:12.040 --> 1:53:18.040]  X2, the deep earth crystal iodine and X3 cry iodine has deep crystal and two other types.
[1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:22.040]  Again, it's apples and oranges. Which one's the best depends on you and your body.
[1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:26.040]  They're both 50 and 60% off respectively with free shipping and double vagrant points.
[1:53:26.040 --> 1:53:31.040]  And by the way, we're selling out of X3 as I'm selling it so low, almost a loss leader.
[1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:35.040]  We'll make like $3 a model or something of this price with free shipping. That's okay.
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:39.040]  Because I want you to see how great it is and you're going to buy it at the regular price and keep us on air.
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:45.040]  But it's selling out quick. Infowarscore.com. A bunch of other stuff is going to stay on as well as a big event.
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:53.040]  Hydrofluorolistic acid is an electrified form of fluoride.
[1:53:53.040 --> 1:53:58.040]  Now microscopic amounts of calcium fluoride are needed for our bodies and are good for us.
[1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:04.040]  But tiny amounts. A lot of it's deadly poison. But hydrofluorolistic acid is electrified.
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:08.040]  It's one of the most deadly toxic poisons on the planet.
[1:54:08.040 --> 1:54:11.040]  And since the late 1940s, a little gift from the New World Order.
[1:54:11.040 --> 1:54:18.040]  They've been putting it in our water to annihilate our DNA, twist our chromosomes and lower our IQs and fertility.
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:23.040]  Well, there has to be a good halogen and it's called iodine.
[1:54:23.040 --> 1:54:28.040]  And we happen to have the highest quality formulas of iodine available anywhere.
[1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:35.040]  We have to have a DEA license at our manufacturer just to put out the deep-earned crystals that are in X2 and X3.
[1:54:35.040 --> 1:54:37.040]  Both of which are discounted through the Fourth of July.
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:41.040]  The double-patria points and free shipping. 50% off for X2.
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:49.040]  60% off for X3 and X3 selling out. Take advantage of it now.
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:54.040]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[1:54:54.040 --> 1:55:04.040]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[1:55:04.040 --> 1:55:11.040]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[1:55:11.040 --> 1:55:16.040]  Orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[1:55:16.040 --> 1:55:24.040]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:29.040]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:34.040]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:38.040]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:42.040]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:56:11.040]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:13.040]  All right, I'm going to play a few clips.
[1:56:13.040 --> 1:56:17.040]  There's a lot more of these from Trump's little intimate speech he gave at the border wall yesterday.
[1:56:17.040 --> 1:56:21.040]  I was there, but I saw all the international media there.
[1:56:21.040 --> 1:56:24.040]  I didn't want to try to cause an upset. I just didn't get out.
[1:56:24.040 --> 1:56:29.040]  But my crew did. They all got footage of it and the rest of it, but we were brought in there.
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:34.040]  And I just sat back and said, you know, I'm going to let Trump have this moment because I went out there again.
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:38.040]  Here is the Trump stalker, Jim Acosta.
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:42.040]  You've seen him shout out the questions about January 6 where Trump should get on the offense.
[1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:44.040]  He exposes a deep state operation.
[1:56:44.040 --> 1:56:50.040]  And then we'll play Lauren Bobert, who I think is just an awesome member of Congress.
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:56.040]  And what she had to say, we also representative Ronnie Jackson and a bunch of other interviews at Band-Aid video.
[1:56:56.040 --> 1:57:05.040]  But here is Acosta and the representative Bobert.
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:09.040]  Thank you for all of these incredible congressmen that came and women. We appreciate it.
[1:57:09.040 --> 1:57:11.040]  Thank you, Lauren, very much. I'll see you soon.
[1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:13.040]  Thank you, Governor. Congratulations.
[1:57:13.040 --> 1:57:15.040]  Congratulations.
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:17.040]  Thank you, everybody.
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:25.040]  Mr. Trump, will you apologize about January 6?
[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:36.040]  No.
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:39.040]  So that's that little clip right there.
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:55.040]  That's got some other great long interviews, but here's the representative. Here she is.
[1:57:55.040 --> 1:58:02.040]  Do you miss President Trump? I know you do. You miss him so much. So much.
[1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:07.040]  Hey, Congresswoman Bobert, have you been down to McAllen where they're actually processing people in and out?
[1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:11.040]  I've been in the border patrol holding facilities, HHS.
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:15.040]  I've been down to the temporary outdoor processing facility and then another one last night.
[1:58:15.040 --> 1:58:20.040]  And it's devastating what's taking place there. It's an absolute communitarian crisis.
[1:58:20.040 --> 1:58:26.040]  I don't want to hear another darn thing about any American having to shut down their life because of a pandemic,
[1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:30.040]  because of the China virus, after what I've seen here in McAllen, Texas.
[1:58:30.040 --> 1:58:36.040]  Border patrol is not testing one single migrant that crosses the border for COVID-19.
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:40.040]  They're not testing until they get into the HHS facility if they get tested.
[1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:43.040]  And that can be 72 hours in 21 days.
[1:58:43.040 --> 1:58:50.040]  And so I don't want to hear another darn thing about Americans having to change their way of life over this stupid China virus ever again,
[1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:54.040]  because of this dereliction of duties for the president right now.
[1:58:54.040 --> 1:58:59.040]  It's disaster, allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to explore into our country.
[1:58:59.040 --> 1:59:04.040]  And this is not just an Arizona or a Texas problem. This is a problem for the entire country.
[1:59:04.040 --> 1:59:09.040]  We've been in the McAllen airport, where I've seen dozens of groups of people with their Manila envelopes
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:13.040]  and instructions on how to travel all throughout the country to get to their destination.
[1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:19.040]  Talking to groups last night, they're going to California, they're going to Philadelphia, they're going to Minneapolis.
[1:59:19.040 --> 1:59:28.040]  These folks are going everywhere. Colorado is a sanctuary state and our governor has just lessened restrictions on illegal aliens
[1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:31.040]  and provided them more access to benefits.
[1:59:31.040 --> 1:59:35.040]  This is a crisis for our entire nation and the president needs to do something about it.
[1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:40.040]  This is why I introduced a censure resolution to censure Biden for his inaction at this border wall.
[1:59:40.040 --> 1:59:45.040]  I want you to see. That is President Trump's wall. That is Biden's portion.
[1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:55.040]  That is where he canceled construction of the border wall and put this country at risk for a national security crisis.
[1:59:55.040 --> 1:59:59.040]  All right, thank you.
[1:59:59.040 --> 2:00:03.040]  I'll tell you, Congressman Boebert is absolutely amazing.
[2:00:03.040 --> 2:00:06.040]  Lauren Boebert and then also Lauren Witzke. I love all these Lauren's.
[2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:11.040]  I had a chance to meet her before she was a congresswoman, right before she had elected at the Virginia rally
[2:00:11.040 --> 2:00:14.040]  and just a absolute firecracker.
[2:00:14.040 --> 2:00:19.040]  And I would love to see half of Congress or more be women like that.
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:23.040]  They could be brown, they could be white, they could be black, they could be coconut colored.
[2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:30.040]  Long as that pink matter in their head is pro-human, it just, there's nothing cooler.
[2:00:30.040 --> 2:00:32.040]  And I'll say it's sexier.
[2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:36.040]  If you have a good-looking woman that's dumb and it just, they ain't, they ain't good-looking,
[2:00:36.040 --> 2:00:40.040]  but you've had good looks with smarts. I like it. I like it a lot.
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:43.040]  And my wife likes it too. She admires women like that. That's what we need.
[2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:46.040]  I just love empowered women. Gosh, it makes me excited.
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:50.040]  All these dumb liberal women look like a spider. They're so loud.
[2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:53.040]  Don't like them very much. Stay with us.
[2:01:20.040 --> 2:01:24.040]  Well, 40% off with the free shipping and double-patriot points.

[2:01:40.040 --> 2:01:44.040]  but every day visit infowarstore.com because there's going to be new specials of select items

[2:01:49.040 --> 2:01:54.040]  The 4th of July Super Sale starts now at infowarstore.com.
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:24.040]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:29.040]  what we're about to cover is earth-shattering information.
[2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:35.040]  And it's what I was already told by medical doctors personally known by me who were scared to come on the show.
[2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:40.040]  But it's also in the mainline medical literature that up until a couple years ago,
[2:02:40.040 --> 2:02:44.040]  they would always say pregnant women should not take inoculations
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:48.040]  because even if it's a decent vaccine for something real, that's a real science,
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:52.040]  it can cause an autoimmune response and you will reject your baby.
[2:02:52.040 --> 2:02:56.040]  So vaccines until a few years ago said do not take while pregnant.
[2:02:56.040 --> 2:03:00.040]  In fact, a lot of them still say that on the informational insert.
[2:03:00.040 --> 2:03:05.040]  But because they wanted to stonewall people and say, oh, there's never a problem with regular vaccines,
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:08.040]  even though they have a secret damage fund and payout billions a year
[2:03:08.040 --> 2:03:12.040]  and they have damage funds around the world, so this doesn't make it to the news.
[2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:17.040]  Now they've got their mRNA gene therapy that rewrites the DNA
[2:03:17.040 --> 2:03:20.040]  and they came out yesterday and admitted, okay, it does rewrite your DNA.
[2:03:20.040 --> 2:03:25.040]  It makes your whole body attack proteins that just so happen to be in the placenta.
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:28.040]  And what did Wolfgang Wudarg, the head of the main advisory union,
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:32.040]  EU commission say in December last year in emergency filing
[2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:38.040]  with Dr. Yidon, the former chief scientist advisor, this will cause spontaneous abortions.
[2:03:38.040 --> 2:03:43.040]  This will probably cause shedding of viruses that will make women have miscarriages
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:47.040]  but also attack women's uterus.
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:51.040]  And now it's happened, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:03:51.040 --> 2:03:57.040]  I just read the study that's using mainline federal numbers
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.040]  from the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the most prestigious journals in the world.
[2:04:03.040 --> 2:04:06.040]  DepopulationAlert, the articles on infowars.com,
[2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:13.040]  shocking new study reveals COVID vaccine treatments
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:19.040]  terminates four out of five pregnancies via spontaneous abortions.
[2:04:19.040 --> 2:04:23.040]  The medical doctor that Rob Do and I both know
[2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:30.040]  said that every woman he knows in his practice, he's an OGBYN, here in Austin,
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:37.040]  50-something-year-old dude been practicing 20 years, every woman in his practice
[2:04:37.040 --> 2:04:46.040]  that he told don't do it, went and did it, had a miscarriage.
[2:04:46.040 --> 2:04:50.040]  You know, I might just go to his office and grab him by the damn hair and drag his ass on this show,
[2:04:50.040 --> 2:04:54.040]  but he knows, he's not supposed to tell you that, he'll get in trouble, see?
[2:04:54.040 --> 2:05:02.040]  Man, this is sick, but this is the New England Journal of Medicine.
[2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:05.040]  You see, they can't get it authorized for children, even though it's unauthorized,
[2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:08.040]  even emergency authorization, their own scientists won't do that.
[2:05:08.040 --> 2:05:12.040]  They go, don't do it to kids, oh, don't do it to babies.
[2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:18.040]  But see, they don't count a baby inside mama, that poor little baby, as a human,
[2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:23.040]  so they can get hit.
[2:05:23.040 --> 2:05:26.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, let me read you this article.
[2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:31.040]  A shocking new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that
[2:05:31.040 --> 2:05:35.040]  when pregnant women are given COVID vaccinations during their first or second trimester,
[2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:40.040]  they suffer an 82% spontaneous abortion rate.
[2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:44.040]  How many videos do I have out of Thailand and out of areas of Africa,
[2:05:44.040 --> 2:05:47.040]  you name it, where the women go, the women go, they come to our village, give a shot,
[2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:51.040]  then I lose my baby, I feel my baby kicking, and then he not kicked no more,
[2:05:51.040 --> 2:05:55.040]  and then two days later, he come out.
[2:05:55.040 --> 2:05:57.040]  Unbelievable.
[2:05:57.040 --> 2:06:03.040]  This stunning finding explained below is self-evident from the data published in the new study entitled
[2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:09.040]  Preliminary Findings of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Women.
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:17.040]  Just as disturbing as the data is the fact that the study authors apparently sought to deliberately obfuscate
[2:06:17.040 --> 2:06:22.040]  the truth about the vaccines causing spontaneous abortion.
[2:06:22.040 --> 2:06:27.040]  If you understand, this was attempted cover-up by obfuscating numbers in their own calculations.
[2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:31.040]  Originally brought to our attention by a Life Science news article,
[2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:36.040]  we checked with our own science contacts to review the data and double-check all the math.
[2:06:36.040 --> 2:06:39.040]  In doing so, we were able to confirm natural news.
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:41.040]  Two things.
[2:06:41.040 --> 2:06:47.040]  Yes, the study shows an 82% rate of spontaneous abortions and expected mothers given COVID vaccines
[2:06:47.040 --> 2:06:50.040]  during their first and second trimesters.
[2:06:50.040 --> 2:06:53.040]  They may be the lucky ones, imagine what's going to happen to kids that are born.
[2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:59.040]  Number two, yes, the study authors either deliberately sought to hide the facts in dishonest obfuscation
[2:06:59.040 --> 2:07:04.040]  explained below, or they are incompetent and made a glaring error that brings into question their credibility.
[2:07:04.040 --> 2:07:10.040]  In other words, the study was almost certainly a cover-up to try to calm vaccinated pregnant women
[2:07:10.040 --> 2:07:13.040]  as perfectly safe, but the study data actually shows the opposite.
[2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:15.040]  How many nurses have we shown you going,
[2:07:15.040 --> 2:07:17.040]  I cook it, my baby died, I'll do it again?
[2:07:17.040 --> 2:07:20.040]  Because I'm a hero.
[2:07:20.040 --> 2:07:24.040]  Because women are survivors, and in a normal travel situation,
[2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:27.040]  if an enemy comes through and kills all the men and kidnaps you,
[2:07:27.040 --> 2:07:33.040]  if you're a woman genetically and don't fight back and you hold off to their kingdom a hundred miles away or wherever,
[2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:39.040]  and they're getting gang-raped and you put up with that, you will pass on more humans, you will survive.
[2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:43.040]  So women go under Stockholm.
[2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:47.040]  It's why the Romans, the Aztecs, anybody would go capture the enemy, they kill all the men.
[2:07:47.040 --> 2:07:51.040]  They keep the women and children, because they would subserve and be slaves.
[2:07:51.040 --> 2:07:56.040]  Women under pressure, on average, will buckle.
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:59.040]  Even though they don't like it at first, they will then trick their mind,
[2:07:59.040 --> 2:08:02.040]  like the Japanese saying, if rape isn't able to enjoy it,
[2:08:02.040 --> 2:08:11.040]  and they will subserve themselves and put up with it.
[2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:13.040]  And that's it.
[2:08:13.040 --> 2:08:17.040]  And so they are killing the babies.
[2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:20.040]  And the women literally go, in the news article we've shown you,
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:25.040]  I had a six-month-old daughter and she died, but it's worth it.
[2:08:25.040 --> 2:08:30.040]  I'll take it again.
[2:08:30.040 --> 2:08:35.040]  The death of your own child is not a big deal, because you're a hero,
[2:08:35.040 --> 2:08:38.040]  because you can't admit the system's evil, because that's scary, isn't it?
[2:08:38.040 --> 2:08:41.040]  Believe me, it is scary.
[2:08:41.040 --> 2:08:47.040]  700 of 827 women were vaccinated in the third trimester.
[2:08:47.040 --> 2:08:50.040]  They manipulate the tables even higher than what they said.
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:55.040]  Table four from the study shows below reveals the total of 827 women, pregnant women,
[2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:00.040]  which studied out of the 827 women, 700 of them received their first vaccine
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:02.040]  in the third trimester of pregnancy.
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:06.040]  This means 127 women, which is 827 to 700,
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:10.040]  received a vaccine during their first and second trimesters.
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:12.040]  And it goes on from there.
[2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:16.040]  Out of 127 women receiving vaccines during their first and second trimesters,
[2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:21.040]  104 spontaneous abortions occurred before their pregnancies hit the 20-week mark.
[2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:25.040]  These are indicated as spontaneous abortions on the table.
[2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:29.040]  It's simple math, 104 spontaneous abortions during the first 20 weeks.
[2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:33.040]  Out of 127 women who received vaccines in their first and second trimesters,
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:38.040]  calculates 82% rate of spontaneous abortions among these pregnant women who were vaccinated.
[2:09:38.040 --> 2:09:42.040]  It's important to note that the deaths of unborn babies during the third trimester
[2:09:42.040 --> 2:09:46.040]  are known as stillbirths and not spontaneous abortions.
[2:09:46.040 --> 2:09:52.040]  Thus, the spontaneous abortions could not have possibly occurred in women vaccinated in the third trimester.
[2:09:52.040 --> 2:09:58.040]  Thus, the study authors dishonestly used the wrong denominator of 827
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:00.040]  on the spontaneous abortions calculations,
[2:10:00.040 --> 2:10:03.040]  which they should have used the denominator 127,
[2:10:03.040 --> 2:10:07.040]  which is the number of women receiving vaccines during their first trimesters.
[2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:10.040]  Put another way, it's impossible for women who've been vaccinated
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:15.040]  for the first time during their third trimester to have a spontaneous abortion in the first 20 weeks
[2:10:15.040 --> 2:10:18.040]  since they weren't vaccinated during the first 20 weeks,
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:21.040]  and pregnant women aren't time travelers.
[2:10:21.040 --> 2:10:26.040]  Thus, the women shouldn't be included in the denominator used to calculate the spontaneous abortion rate,
[2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:33.040]  but they did it to hide it, but it's still a massive one-third death rate.
[2:10:33.040 --> 2:10:35.040]  And it goes on and on and on.
[2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:37.040]  Articles up at infowars.com.
[2:10:37.040 --> 2:10:39.040]  Oh, she's able to do it.
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:41.040]  Perfect timing with this breaking.
[2:10:41.040 --> 2:10:46.040]  Sherry Tenpenny is scheduled to join us in the next segment.
[2:10:46.040 --> 2:10:48.040]  The Lord works mysterious ways of trying to get her for months.
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:51.040]  She's suddenly able to come on straight ahead,
[2:10:51.040 --> 2:10:55.040]  and then China threatens nuclear war with the United States,
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:10:56.040]  but they're not the threat.
[2:10:56.040 --> 2:10:59.040]  White supremacists are killing everybody everywhere.
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:02.040]  Why, they're just crawling off from under rocks.
[2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:05.040]  Please never forget, we can't be on air without you.
[2:11:05.040 --> 2:11:08.040]  Every day we're on air is precious and a blessing from the Lord.

[2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:38.040]  The tri iodine, the good halogen for your fertility, for your stamina, for your libido, for your immune system.
[2:11:38.040 --> 2:11:42.040]  Iodine is so key, the tri iodine, $16 a bottle with free shipping,
[2:11:42.040 --> 2:11:45.040]  that's almost a lost leader, infowarsstore.com,
[2:11:45.040 --> 2:11:48.040]  and the X3 is selling out at that price.
[2:11:48.040 --> 2:11:51.040]  So it's going to end in the next few days.
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:11:59.040]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:04.040]  in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:09.040]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date,
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:12.040]  Super Male Vitality,
[2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:17.040]  specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:20.040]  to create superior vitality in males.

[2:12:31.040 --> 2:12:37.040]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology,
[2:12:37.040 --> 2:12:44.040]  working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:47.040]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the infowarsstore.
[2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:49.040]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:54.040]  Super Male Vitality at infowarsstore.com.
[2:12:54.040 --> 2:12:57.040]  The most important thing I've done in the last eight years for my health,
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:02.040]  for my middle clarity, for my focus has been Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:06.040]  Dr. Group hammered me and hammered me nine, ten years ago and said,
[2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:10.040]  Alex, you've got to start taking Deep Earth Crystal Atomic Iodine.
[2:13:10.040 --> 2:13:13.040]  And when I finally started taking it, it changed my life.
[2:13:13.040 --> 2:13:17.040]  Even the UN's own health website admits over two million people
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:22.040]  have cognitive disabilities, lower IQ, because of lack of Iodine.
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:27.040]  But we have two varieties of high-quality Iodine that will blow you away on sale right now.
[2:13:27.040 --> 2:13:32.040]  X2, the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, and X3, the Tri-Iodine, Deep Earth Crystal Iodine,
[2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:36.040]  and two other types, which some people need, all three types for absorption.
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:40.040]  So it's apples and oranges, two different formulas, some people like one, better, or the other.
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:43.040]  But the point is they're all discounted right now.
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:49.040]  50% off for X2, 60% off for X3, with free shipping, double-patriot points,
[2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:52.040]  two to the fourth of July. We're running out of X3, so get your orders in now,
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:14:21.040]  at forestore.com.
[2:14:22.040 --> 2:14:35.040]  Welcome back, my friends.
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:41.040]  We have Dr. Sherri Tinpenny, who has been listed by the EU, by the globalists,
[2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:45.040]  by the Democrats as one of the top people.
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:47.040]  They want to shut down and they want to silence.
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:48.040]  She's a medical doctor.
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:53.040]  They've now, for 20 years, saw their own practices, what was happening with vaccines,
[2:14:53.040 --> 2:14:56.040]  and she's been a champion of warning the public.
[2:14:56.040 --> 2:15:01.040]  And she was out there before the inoculations even began with this experimental shot saying,
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:04.040]  I believe it's going to cause serious illnesses and death.
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:10.040]  All other top scientists like Wolfgang Wudarg and the former chief scientist at Pfizer
[2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:14.040]  have gone public warning of this, and now it happens.
[2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:18.040]  I think it's just best with all that's unfolded, since he was on with us four months ago,
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:23.040]  that interview went viral, to just have the floor cover whatever she thinks is most important
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:28.040]  with what is unfolding now, and now the targeting of newborn babies with the parents
[2:15:28.040 --> 2:15:33.040]  enrolling them in these studies just seems to be like total Nuremberg violations.
[2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:38.040]  Dr. Tinpenny, thanks for spending time with us, and we're really proud of the work you've been doing.
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:42.040]  Thank you so much for having me back, Alex, and it's a pleasure to be here.
[2:15:42.040 --> 2:15:45.040]  Okay, we only got about 40 minutes with you. You've got the floor.
[2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:47.040]  What do people need to know since you were last on?
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:51.040]  Vendication, I know, is not sweet for you. You tried to stop this.
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:57.040]  Yeah, I have been trying to stop it very loudly since the beginning, since March of last year.
[2:15:57.040 --> 2:16:01.040]  In fact, as you know, my schedule has been really packed with interviews.
[2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:07.040]  I've done well over 450 now since actually February of last year.
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:12.040]  And for people who don't know what I do, I mean, I've been doing this for, it'll be 21 years in September.
[2:16:12.040 --> 2:16:18.040]  I've logged more than 40,000 hours of personal research into problems associated with vaccines
[2:16:18.040 --> 2:16:20.040]  that I've been on broadcast, podcasts.
[2:16:20.040 --> 2:16:24.040]  I've written two books which are currently not in print for various reasons right now,
[2:16:24.040 --> 2:16:28.040]  but I've written a new e-book called The 20 Mechanisms of Injury,
[2:16:28.040 --> 2:16:32.040]  How the COVID Shots Can Make You Sick and Possibly Kill You.
[2:16:32.040 --> 2:16:36.040]  We're actually doing a training video on this on July the 10th.
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:39.040]  You can register by going to DrTenpenny.com.
[2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:45.040]  If it's the first time to our website, there should be a pop-up that greets you to have you register for the webinar.
[2:16:45.040 --> 2:16:50.040]  If you've been there before, you will have to click on the events button at the top
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:56.040]  so that it will say like live webinar because it's actually 20 plus mechanisms, Alex,
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:58.040]  because I did this webinar in May.
[2:16:58.040 --> 2:17:01.040]  And as it turned out, not very good planning on my part.
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:05.040]  It was on Mother's Day weekend.
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:09.040]  And so we've had a lot of people who've said, gosh, I missed it.
[2:17:09.040 --> 2:17:11.040]  I was out of town. We were busy. We had family over.
[2:17:11.040 --> 2:17:13.040]  Can you please do it again?
[2:17:13.040 --> 2:17:16.040]  So by popular demand, we're doing it on July the 10th.
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:19.040]  A lot of people said there was so much information the first time.
[2:17:19.040 --> 2:17:21.040]  I want to listen to it a second time.
[2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:23.040]  And you've got a lot of nurses, a lot of doctors, a lot of scientists,
[2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:28.040]  but also common people, they're going to hear a medical doctor go through a huge class.
[2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:31.040]  So we've got the information we need to be leaders in our communities.
[2:17:31.040 --> 2:17:34.040]  This is so important.
[2:17:34.040 --> 2:17:36.040]  And it's the 20 mechanisms of injury.
[2:17:36.040 --> 2:17:39.040]  And actually, I found multiple more that we're going to be talking about.
[2:17:39.040 --> 2:17:44.040]  So not only is it a refresher, because I really believe that the key to learning,
[2:17:44.040 --> 2:17:47.040]  repetition is the key to learning so people can hear it again
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:50.040]  of how they can warn people who are still in the fence.
[2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:53.040]  And Alex, more importantly, as people have gone through,
[2:17:53.040 --> 2:17:59.040]  I heard earlier today that somewhere around 47% of people in the U.S.
[2:17:59.040 --> 2:18:01.040]  have gotten one of these shots.
[2:18:01.040 --> 2:18:05.040]  I'm not sure if that's a real number, but let's just go with it and say that it is.
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:09.040]  As they start to get sick because they are going to,
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:11.040]  you need to know what to look for, what to watch for,
[2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:14.040]  because if you catch these symptoms early,
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:16.040]  and we're going to talk about this in the webinar,
[2:18:16.040 --> 2:18:19.040]  that there may be some things that you can do to help.
[2:18:19.040 --> 2:18:22.040]  But one of the important things is you can file a VAERS report
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:25.040]  and you can educate your doctor and say,
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:31.040]  doctor, not only yes, my mother, my father, my sister, my best friend, my child,
[2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:33.040]  is having side effects from these shots.
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:37.040]  You don't have to run them through a $100 million medical workup,
[2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:39.040]  or $100,000 medical workup.
[2:18:39.040 --> 2:18:44.040]  You can just say that this is a side effect of one of these shots, act accordingly.
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:48.040]  So you've got bullets for your gun metaphorically to speak.
[2:18:48.040 --> 2:18:51.040]  You can hopefully still keep people from getting the shot,
[2:18:51.040 --> 2:18:54.040]  keep them from getting the second shot.
[2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:57.040]  So if they start to have side effects, you know what to look for.
[2:18:57.040 --> 2:19:00.040]  And we're going to talk some new things, some new mechanisms.
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:02.040]  We're going to talk about the magnetism.
[2:19:02.040 --> 2:19:04.040]  We're going to talk about myocarditis.
[2:19:04.040 --> 2:19:07.040]  We're going to talk about tissue modification.
[2:19:07.040 --> 2:19:09.040]  We're going to talk about a multiple other things.
[2:19:09.040 --> 2:19:11.040]  I won't let the cat out of the bag,
[2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:14.040]  but some serious things that people need to know about,
[2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:19.040]  additional ways how these shots are designed to make you sick and even kill you.
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:21.040]  And by the way, doctor, I was really trying to give you the floor
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:23.040]  because you've got a lot to say.
[2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:26.040]  There are thousands of other medical doctors they tried to censor and block.
[2:19:26.040 --> 2:19:28.040]  Davos group coming out two days ago and saying,
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:31.040]  we're working with governments to suppress people and you by name.
[2:19:31.040 --> 2:19:35.040]  When mainline science, mainline doctors all agree with you.
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:37.040]  Now you're one of the first saying this,
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:41.040]  but now almost every doctor I see and my personal doctor agrees with you,
[2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:42.040]  but won't come on air.
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:44.040]  Rob Do's personal doctor agrees, won't come on air.
[2:19:44.040 --> 2:19:46.040]  An OGBYN I know won't come on air,
[2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:48.040]  but says every woman that's taken the vaccine,
[2:19:48.040 --> 2:19:50.040]  they knows how to miscarry as it was pregnant.
[2:19:50.040 --> 2:19:52.040]  I mean, this is what you're saying is,
[2:19:52.040 --> 2:19:54.040]  it's like on CNN, you're out in left field.
[2:19:54.040 --> 2:19:56.040]  You're covering mainline science.
[2:19:56.040 --> 2:20:00.040]  We had Dr. Angela Ferral on yesterday and she was saying,
[2:20:00.040 --> 2:20:02.040]  I can't say that this isn't sinister.
[2:20:02.040 --> 2:20:03.040]  It's on purpose.
[2:20:03.040 --> 2:20:06.040]  She said, this is all mainline science they're going against.
[2:20:06.040 --> 2:20:07.040]  It absolutely is.
[2:20:07.040 --> 2:20:10.040]  And so all these people who say that we are anti-science,
[2:20:10.040 --> 2:20:14.040]  conspiracy theorist, tinfoil hat, anti-vaccine.
[2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:17.040]  And so therefore we have nothing to say.
[2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:19.040]  You know, Alex, what it comes down to,
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:21.040]  and you know this better than anybody,
[2:20:21.040 --> 2:20:23.040]  is that when they can't beat you on the science,
[2:20:23.040 --> 2:20:26.040]  the only thing they have left is mud-slinging,
[2:20:26.040 --> 2:20:28.040]  name-calling, and character assassination.
[2:20:28.040 --> 2:20:31.040]  So for me, it's sort of like, okay,
[2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:32.040]  it's happened before.
[2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:34.040]  It's been going on for a long time.
[2:20:34.040 --> 2:20:36.040]  It reminds me of when I was in the first grade,
[2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:38.040]  when my mom said to me, you know, Sherry,
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:40.040]  sticks and stones can break your bones,
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:41.040]  but names can never hurt you.
[2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:45.040]  Don't stop what you're doing just because somebody's trying
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:49.040]  to call you names and do character assassination,
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:51.040]  because they can't beat me on the science,
[2:20:51.040 --> 2:20:52.040]  and they know it.
[2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:53.040]  And you know what?
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:55.040]  There were a lot of doctors, Alex,
[2:20:55.040 --> 2:20:57.040]  a lot of doctors that took our webinar the first time
[2:20:57.040 --> 2:20:59.040]  that actually reached out to me, medical doctors,
[2:20:59.040 --> 2:21:03.040]  MDs, DOs, naturopaths, who reached out to me
[2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:05.040]  after the webinar, and they were like, wow,
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:07.040]  I had no idea.
[2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:08.040]  Thank you so much.
[2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:11.040]  The information you gave us was so valuable.
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:14.040]  So if we can convert them one doctor at a time,
[2:21:14.040 --> 2:21:17.040]  that one doctor sees 5,000 patients.
[2:21:17.040 --> 2:21:19.040]  So perhaps of those 5,000 patients,
[2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:22.040]  we can keep more of them from being injected
[2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:25.040]  with this genetic modification technology
[2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:28.040]  that will permanently and irreversibly change your genes.
[2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:30.040]  We're going to break in a minute and a half.
[2:21:30.040 --> 2:21:32.040]  I'm going to come back for the next 20 minutes.
[2:21:32.040 --> 2:21:34.040]  You've got the floor next 30 minutes, 100%.
[2:21:34.040 --> 2:21:36.040]  Give us a prelude of the top points you're going to hit
[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:38.040]  when we come back.
[2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:42.040]  We're going to talk about the magnetism.
[2:21:42.040 --> 2:21:43.040]  And it's real.
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:45.040]  I want to read you a couple of title articles
[2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:47.040]  and things that I found because, you know,
[2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:49.040]  you showed that little bit of a screenshot
[2:21:49.040 --> 2:21:51.040]  of when I testified at the state house
[2:21:51.040 --> 2:21:53.040]  down in Columbus to promote our bill.
[2:21:53.040 --> 2:21:55.040]  And it looks as though the bill is going to pass.
[2:21:55.040 --> 2:21:57.040]  Absolutely, the bill is going to pass
[2:21:57.040 --> 2:21:59.040]  so that employers in the state of Ohio
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:02.040]  cannot mandate people to get a COVID shot
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:04.040]  to keep their job.
[2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:06.040]  So part of my testimony was that,
[2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:08.040]  so I'm happy to be drugged through the mill
[2:22:08.040 --> 2:22:10.040]  if that's going to keep our people in the state of Ohio
[2:22:10.040 --> 2:22:13.040]  and perhaps set a precedent to other states
[2:22:13.040 --> 2:22:16.040]  so that employers cannot make you get an experimental,
[2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:19.040]  not proven, no long-term study, injection
[2:22:19.040 --> 2:22:21.040]  in order to keep a job to feed your family
[2:22:21.040 --> 2:22:23.040]  and keep a roof over your head.
[2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:24.040]  Well, I got to say this.
[2:22:24.040 --> 2:22:26.040]  Hollywood stars mean nothing to me.
[2:22:26.040 --> 2:22:28.040]  Politicians, you know, I was with Trump yesterday.
[2:22:28.040 --> 2:22:30.040]  He's a good guy. I like him overall,
[2:22:30.040 --> 2:22:32.040]  but he got lied to about the vaccine.
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:34.040]  But, you know, I didn't get excited being 20 feet from Trump.
[2:22:34.040 --> 2:22:37.040]  But with you, I get so excited because of your leadership,
[2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:39.040]  how you've been right, and how you're standing and steering.
[2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:42.040]  We admired Dr. Sherry Timpinney so much.
[2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:43.040]  We're going to come right back to her.
[2:22:43.040 --> 2:22:44.040]  We'll give you the website again,
[2:22:44.040 --> 2:22:46.040]  and she's going to have the floor when we come back.
[2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:48.040]  Dr. Timpinney.com.
[2:22:48.040 --> 2:22:50.040]  Dr. Timpinney.com.
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:52.040]  So, everybody, you know, tune in now.
[2:22:56.040 --> 2:22:58.040]  Your voice counts.
[2:22:58.040 --> 2:23:01.040]  When you share information, be it over the Internet
[2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:03.040]  or in person, it changes the world.
[2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:06.040]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:23:06.040 --> 2:23:07.040]  They know you're angry.
[2:23:07.040 --> 2:23:09.040]  And now, to get around big tech,
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:13.040]  it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[2:23:13.040 --> 2:23:14.040]  Well, ladies and gentlemen,

[2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:58.040]  The globalists are having their revolution,
[2:23:58.040 --> 2:24:01.040]  but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[2:24:01.040 --> 2:24:05.040]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers
[2:24:05.040 --> 2:24:11.040]  trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:18.040]  and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:19.040]  worse than slaves,
[2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:23.040]  just property from cradle to grave of the system,
[2:24:23.040 --> 2:24:27.040]  rendered down to be servile minions of the system
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:31.040]  and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:34.040]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[2:24:34.040 --> 2:24:36.040]  which realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:38.040]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[2:24:38.040 --> 2:24:41.040]  that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[2:24:41.040 --> 2:24:42.040]  It's that choice.
[2:24:42.040 --> 2:24:45.040]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:47.040]  And it's the only choice we've got,
[2:24:47.040 --> 2:24:49.040]  freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:51.040]  It is a spiritual battle,
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:53.040]  and Info Wars is the tip of the spear fighting it.
[2:24:53.040 --> 2:24:56.040]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[2:24:56.040 --> 2:24:57.040]  It's very bittersweet.
[2:24:57.040 --> 2:24:59.040]  Everything we've talked about has happened
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:00.040]  just like we said it would,
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:02.040]  and now we have a lot of credibility,
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:03.040]  but I don't care about that.
[2:25:03.040 --> 2:25:05.040]  I care about beating the new world order.
[2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:07.040]  And it's because we have so much credibility,
[2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:10.040]  they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:25:10.040 --> 2:25:12.040]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:14.040]  they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:15.040]  I can't tell you what's going on,
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:16.040]  but let's just say this.
[2:25:16.040 --> 2:25:18.040]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[2:25:18.040 --> 2:25:20.040]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[2:25:20.040 --> 2:25:23.040]  So please pray for us and please buy the products
[2:25:23.040 --> 2:25:24.040]  at InfoWarsTour.com.
[2:25:24.040 --> 2:25:25.040]  They're great products,
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:27.040]  plus they fund the operation.
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:29.040]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy,
[2:25:29.040 --> 2:25:30.040]  they're still great.
[2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:31.040]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:25:31.040 --> 2:25:32.040]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:34.040]  These are great products that fund freedom
[2:25:34.040 --> 2:25:37.040]  and fund justice when the whole world's waking up
[2:25:37.040 --> 2:25:38.040]  and looking for truth.
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:40.040]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:25:40.040 --> 2:25:42.040]  They can't bring in all this tyranny
[2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:43.040]  and leave people like us on the air.
[2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:44.040]  So while you're at it,
[2:25:44.040 --> 2:25:46.040]  don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:25:46.040 --> 2:25:48.040]  Download everything we've done,
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:49.040]  you can find and save it,
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:51.040]  because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:53.040]  and the enemy is trying to destroy
[2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:54.040]  everything we ever said.
[2:25:54.040 --> 2:25:57.040]  The Fourth of July Super Sales starts now

[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:58.040]  at InfoWarsTour.com.
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:27:24.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:27:24.040 --> 2:27:32.040]  Eric Clapton was bullied,
[2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:34.040]  one of my favorite musicians,
[2:27:34.040 --> 2:27:39.040]  was bullied by his family to take the Pfizer shot.
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:41.040]  And of course, you know, it paralyzed him.
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:42.040]  He almost died.
[2:27:42.040 --> 2:27:44.040]  And then he owes other people his personal friends
[2:27:44.040 --> 2:27:46.040]  that got basically paralyzed.
[2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:48.040]  Well, now British rocker dies from brain hemorrhage
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:51.040]  two weeks after AstraZeneca shot.
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:53.040]  They even had to put an advisory on it.
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:55.040]  So Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, last year,
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:57.040]  know this would happen.
[2:27:57.040 --> 2:27:58.040]  How did other scientists know?
[2:27:58.040 --> 2:28:01.040]  Because they read the medical literature.
[2:28:01.040 --> 2:28:03.040]  Absolutely insane.
[2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:06.040]  So going back to Dr. Sherry Tenpenny,
[2:28:06.040 --> 2:28:08.040]  osteopathic medical doctor,
[2:28:08.040 --> 2:28:13.040]  21 years exposing this from her own experiences.
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:16.040]  Now in the middle of this depopulation,
[2:28:16.040 --> 2:28:17.040]  whatever you call it,
[2:28:17.040 --> 2:28:21.040]  please continue and lay out what we're facing.
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:24.040]  Well, it's just really a horrifying thing, Alex.
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:26.040]  And you know, it's interesting that we just got
[2:28:26.040 --> 2:28:28.040]  some notifications yesterday
[2:28:28.040 --> 2:28:32.040]  that they really are giving some people sailing shots.
[2:28:32.040 --> 2:28:34.040]  I mean, and so,
[2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:36.040]  and that's because they don't want everybody to die
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:38.040]  all at once is my opinion of that.
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:41.040]  But every single person that has been injected,
[2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:42.040]  even if you say, oh, well, I don't,
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:44.040]  I feel fine, there's nothing wrong with me.
[2:28:44.040 --> 2:28:46.040]  I always sadly say, well,
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:49.040]  I'm glad that you didn't fall into category one
[2:28:49.040 --> 2:28:52.040]  of the 20 mechanisms of injuries.
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:54.040]  Category one is sudden death,
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:57.040]  which is anaphylactic shock, heart attack, and stroke.
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:28:58.040]  And so you didn't have one of those.
[2:28:58.040 --> 2:29:00.040]  So that doesn't mean you're scot-free
[2:29:00.040 --> 2:29:02.040]  because you're going to have spike proteins in your body
[2:29:02.040 --> 2:29:05.040]  that can do all kinds of detrimental things.
[2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:07.040]  You can have antibodies to the spike proteins,
[2:29:07.040 --> 2:29:09.040]  which will probably be around forever.
[2:29:09.040 --> 2:29:12.040]  The antibodies themselves can attack your lungs,
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:13.040]  your kidneys, and your livers,
[2:29:13.040 --> 2:29:15.040]  and cause autoimmune disease.
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:17.040]  And then there's a whole kind of cluster
[2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:19.040]  of other types of things.
[2:29:19.040 --> 2:29:20.040]  And that's going to be greatly expanded
[2:29:20.040 --> 2:29:22.040]  on our webinar in July the 10th.
[2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:25.040]  We're going to talk really in depth about this cardiomyopathy
[2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:27.040]  because this cardiomyopathy,
[2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:29.040]  that all these teenage kids are getting,
[2:29:29.040 --> 2:29:30.040]  all these teenage boys,
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:34.040]  there was a report in epoch times yesterday of the military.
[2:29:34.040 --> 2:29:36.040]  There's 23 military recruits
[2:29:36.040 --> 2:29:39.040]  that were hospitalized with serious myocarditis.
[2:29:39.040 --> 2:29:42.040]  So I want people to really know what that is
[2:29:42.040 --> 2:29:46.040]  so that they do not, under any circumstances,
[2:29:46.040 --> 2:29:50.040]  allow their teenagers to be injected with this shot,
[2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:53.040]  and particularly their teenage boys.
[2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:55.040]  I had a report yesterday, Alex.
[2:29:55.040 --> 2:29:57.040]  I had a patient in my office
[2:29:57.040 --> 2:30:00.040]  who actually works in a labor and delivery unit
[2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:02.040]  in one of the local hospitals.
[2:30:02.040 --> 2:30:04.040]  And she said this baby was born,
[2:30:04.040 --> 2:30:07.040]  and the mother was furious
[2:30:07.040 --> 2:30:11.040]  that the child wasn't going to be injected with a COVID shot.
[2:30:11.040 --> 2:30:13.040]  Our old baby was furious
[2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:15.040]  that the baby didn't qualify for that.
[2:30:15.040 --> 2:30:18.040]  It's just a travesty of what's happening with our kids.
[2:30:18.040 --> 2:30:20.040]  I don't want to interrupt you,
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:22.040]  but I mean, you raised the big issue.
[2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:23.040]  You've explained this.
[2:30:23.040 --> 2:30:24.040]  The medical literature admits it.
[2:30:24.040 --> 2:30:27.040]  Some say that the VAERS is maybe one out of 10,
[2:30:27.040 --> 2:30:28.040]  one out of 100.
[2:30:28.040 --> 2:30:31.040]  Some studies say it's about 40 times on average
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:33.040]  for every person that dies or gets sick,
[2:30:33.040 --> 2:30:34.040]  that reports to it.
[2:30:34.040 --> 2:30:36.040]  There are many, many times that don't.
[2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:39.040]  But the way I've seen this described in other studies,
[2:30:39.040 --> 2:30:41.040]  and maybe you can clarify it, is you'll see,
[2:30:41.040 --> 2:30:43.040]  oh, a cluster at one military base
[2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:45.040]  or a cluster at one nursing home
[2:30:45.040 --> 2:30:47.040]  or a cluster at one hospital
[2:30:47.040 --> 2:30:49.040]  where they admit, oh, 10 patients died,
[2:30:49.040 --> 2:30:51.040]  20 or 30 got sick from the shot blood clots,
[2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:53.040]  and they go, we don't know why it's a cluster here.
[2:30:53.040 --> 2:30:55.040]  Well, that's where there's a good doctor,
[2:30:55.040 --> 2:30:57.040]  good nurses that see what happened and reported it.
[2:30:57.040 --> 2:30:59.040]  Others cover it up and keep it quiet.
[2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:01.040]  We've had nurses and doctors on
[2:31:01.040 --> 2:31:03.040]  that have said they were ordered to cover it up.
[2:31:03.040 --> 2:31:05.040]  So explain why we hear about clusters.
[2:31:05.040 --> 2:31:07.040]  Isn't that really just where it breaks through
[2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:09.040]  and actually the truth gets out?
[2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:12.040]  Well, I got this kind of a cluster meme
[2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:14.040]  sent to me yesterday, Alex.
[2:31:14.040 --> 2:31:16.040]  It's four screenshots.
[2:31:16.040 --> 2:31:18.040]  I'm looking at it on my computer right now.
[2:31:18.040 --> 2:31:20.040]  Four screenshots from Newsweek Magazine
[2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:22.040]  on different dates.
[2:31:22.040 --> 2:31:24.040]  One was dated April 21st.
[2:31:24.040 --> 2:31:26.040]  One's dated April 19th.
[2:31:26.040 --> 2:31:28.040]  The one that is dated June the 29th.
[2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:30.040]  And there's three different headlines,
[2:31:30.040 --> 2:31:32.040]  and I'm going to read them to you.
[2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:34.040]  Headline number one, group of Canadians
[2:31:34.040 --> 2:31:36.040]  accidentally received saline injection
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:38.040]  instead of COVID-19.
[2:31:38.040 --> 2:31:40.040]  Title number two, Walgreens stores
[2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:42.040]  injects people with saline
[2:31:42.040 --> 2:31:44.040]  rather than with COVID-19
[2:31:44.040 --> 2:31:46.040]  vaccine in a mix-up.
[2:31:46.040 --> 2:31:48.040]  Title number three, saline
[2:31:48.040 --> 2:31:50.040]  injected instead of COVID-19
[2:31:50.040 --> 2:31:52.040]  vaccine in South Carolina.
[2:31:52.040 --> 2:31:54.040]  Is that an accident or is that intentional?
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:31:56.040]  And is this leading to what you just said
[2:31:56.040 --> 2:31:58.040]  about clusters?
[2:31:58.040 --> 2:32:00.040]  Are they sending boxes of vials
[2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:02.040]  that are just normal saline
[2:32:02.040 --> 2:32:04.040]  to certain places and boxes
[2:32:04.040 --> 2:32:06.040]  of the real thing to other places
[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:08.040]  so that they...
[2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:10.040]  Well, let me tell you, I was told
[2:32:10.040 --> 2:32:12.040]  by a retired Army colonel
[2:32:12.040 --> 2:32:14.040]  who has a son in special operations
[2:32:14.040 --> 2:32:16.040]  that they were told,
[2:32:16.040 --> 2:32:18.040]  hey, we're just giving you saline, don't worry.
[2:32:18.040 --> 2:32:20.040]  And then they didn't get sick.
[2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:22.040]  And I've heard from others
[2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:24.040]  the exact same thing that government bureaucrats
[2:32:24.040 --> 2:32:26.040]  are just acting like they're getting a shot.
[2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:28.040]  They're not even taking it.
[2:32:28.040 --> 2:32:30.040]  Exactly. And I think that that's just criminal.
[2:32:30.040 --> 2:32:32.040]  Because, and I think that part of it
[2:32:32.040 --> 2:32:34.040]  is in my opinion, and this is just my opinion,
[2:32:34.040 --> 2:32:36.040]  they don't want everybody
[2:32:36.040 --> 2:32:38.040]  to be sick and dying all at the same time.
[2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:40.040]  We have to have clusters of people
[2:32:40.040 --> 2:32:42.040]  who get their shot and everything seems to be okay.
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:44.040]  And Dr. Peter McCullis
[2:32:44.040 --> 2:32:46.040]  said this yesterday in an interview that he did
[2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:48.040]  where he said the next shot,
[2:32:48.040 --> 2:32:50.040]  these boosters are going to be the real thing
[2:32:50.040 --> 2:32:52.040]  and are really going to be the kill shots.
[2:32:52.040 --> 2:32:54.040]  I want to mention just briefly, Alex,
[2:32:54.040 --> 2:32:56.040]  when I got taken through the mud
[2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:58.040]  like we talked about earlier
[2:32:58.040 --> 2:33:00.040]  by the mainstream media and it really didn't matter to me
[2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:02.040]  about this whole concept of
[2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:04.040]  magnetism and how people
[2:33:04.040 --> 2:33:06.040]  are magnetic.
[2:33:06.040 --> 2:33:08.040]  And I want to read you three titles
[2:33:08.040 --> 2:33:10.040]  of what I'm actually going to be talking about
[2:33:10.040 --> 2:33:12.040]  on the July 10th webinar
[2:33:12.040 --> 2:33:14.040]  on the 20 Mechanisms of Injury
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:16.040]  that you can find by going to DrTempany.com.
[2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:18.040]  If the pop-up doesn't greet you,
[2:33:18.040 --> 2:33:20.040]  you can go to the Events tab
[2:33:20.040 --> 2:33:22.040]  and click on Live Event, Live Webinar.
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:24.040]  Listen to these titles.
[2:33:24.040 --> 2:33:26.040]  This is a chapter from a textbook.
[2:33:26.040 --> 2:33:28.040]  Tissue engineering
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:30.040]  using magnetite nanoparticles.
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:32.040]  And it goes through
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:34.040]  all the steps
[2:33:34.040 --> 2:33:36.040]  on how they do this with polyethylene glycol.
[2:33:36.040 --> 2:33:38.040]  They construct 3D tissue-like structures
[2:33:38.040 --> 2:33:40.040]  and what actually happens
[2:33:40.040 --> 2:33:42.040]  to the tissues with that.
[2:33:42.040 --> 2:33:44.040]  There is another textbook that I found.
[2:33:44.040 --> 2:33:46.040]  This is a 517-page textbook.
[2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:48.040]  It's available as an e-book
[2:33:48.040 --> 2:33:50.040]  that was written on,
[2:33:50.040 --> 2:33:52.040]  that was published in 2018,
[2:33:52.040 --> 2:33:54.040]  Clinical Applications
[2:33:54.040 --> 2:33:56.040]  of Magnetic Nanoparticles.
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:33:58.040]  Another book
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:00.040]  published in 2017,
[2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:02.040]  318-page book,
[2:34:02.040 --> 2:34:04.040]  Magnetic Nanoparticles
[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:06.040]  in Medicine.
[2:34:06.040 --> 2:34:08.040]  They have known this.
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:10.040]  They've been working on this for a long time
[2:34:10.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  and they want to suspend it in a lipid coating
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:14.040]  so they can externally move it
[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:16.040]  to where they want it to be with a magnet.
[2:34:16.040 --> 2:34:18.040]  Now, I have to say,
[2:34:18.040 --> 2:34:20.040]  just in qualification,
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:22.040]  like a lot of things that happen in medicine,
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:24.040]  a lot of things that happen in government,
[2:34:24.040 --> 2:34:26.040]  that they start out with good intentions
[2:34:26.040 --> 2:34:28.040]  and then the good intentions turn rather nefarious.
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:30.040]  The good intention would be
[2:34:30.040 --> 2:34:32.040]  if you could put a particle
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:34.040]  inside of a lipid coating,
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:36.040]  a magnetic particle
[2:34:36.040 --> 2:34:38.040]  and you could put chemotherapy in there
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:40.040]  and you could use an external
[2:34:40.040 --> 2:34:42.040]  magnet
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:44.040]  to move it directly to the cancer
[2:34:44.040 --> 2:34:46.040]  so that it could be released
[2:34:46.040 --> 2:34:48.040]  at the level of the cancer,
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:50.040]  wouldn't that be a better thing
[2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:52.040]  than injecting people with chemotherapy
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:54.040]  so that every cell in their body gets dosed
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:34:56.040]  and they get terribly sick?
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:34:58.040]  You said what I was reading is
[2:34:58.040 --> 2:35:00.040]  these graphite chemicals they found
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:02.040]  is designed to go across the blood-brain barrier.
[2:35:02.040 --> 2:35:04.040]  Why would you want this vaccine
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:06.040]  to go across the blood-brain barrier?
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:08.040]  You don't.
[2:35:08.040 --> 2:35:10.040]  I was just making a point
[2:35:10.040 --> 2:35:12.040]  that when they first started
[2:35:12.040 --> 2:35:14.040]  researching this back in the 70s,
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:16.040]  I think that there was some people
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:18.040]  who thought, well, wouldn't it just be cool
[2:35:18.040 --> 2:35:20.040]  if we could direct these different places
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:22.040]  and then DARPA gets involved
[2:35:22.040 --> 2:35:24.040]  and as you know, anything that has DARPA
[2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:26.040]  is going to go across the blood-brain barrier.
[2:35:26.040 --> 2:35:28.040]  And so now
[2:35:28.040 --> 2:35:30.040]  the graphene
[2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:32.040]  can go across the blood-brain barrier.
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:34.040]  The spike protein can pull
[2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:36.040]  holes in the blood-brain barrier
[2:35:36.040 --> 2:35:38.040]  and you can take that spike protein
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:40.040]  into the brain.
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:42.040]  It can modify something called the FUSE
[2:35:42.040 --> 2:35:44.040]  FUS gene.
[2:35:44.040 --> 2:35:46.040]  When the FUS gene gets modified,
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:48.040]  it leads to ALS or cancer.
[2:35:48.040 --> 2:35:50.040]  You can modify the DTP
[2:35:50.040 --> 2:35:52.040]  another type of protein
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:54.040]  and that degeneration
[2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:56.040]  causes people to lose their ability to speak,
[2:35:56.040 --> 2:35:58.040]  lose their ability to read,
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:00.040]  have facial recognition,
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:02.040]  or to form words.
[2:36:02.040 --> 2:36:04.040]  And we hear about people being in a fog
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:06.040]  just like the autistic kids,
[2:36:06.040 --> 2:36:08.040]  but they have a name for frontal lobe.
[2:36:08.040 --> 2:36:10.040]  That's called a lobotomy.
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:12.040]  Well, frontal lobe
[2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:14.040]  is the area right behind you.
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:16.040]  I know, but I'm saying what you just described
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:18.040]  sounds like a lobotomy.
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:20.040]  Well, maybe.
[2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:22.040]  It's not a physical lobotomy,
[2:36:22.040 --> 2:36:24.040]  but it certainly could be a chemical one.
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:26.040]  I mean, and it's interesting to me
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:28.040]  that people, if this spike protein
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:30.040]  can punch holes in the blood-brain barrier
[2:36:30.040 --> 2:36:32.040]  and we've got magnetite,
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:34.040]  graphene, other types of things
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:36.040]  that can get into the brain,
[2:36:36.040 --> 2:36:38.040]  and we know that you can disrupt
[2:36:38.040 --> 2:36:40.040]  that FTP43 protein
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:42.040]  and that causes
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:44.040]  frontal temporal lobe degeneration
[2:36:44.040 --> 2:36:46.040]  and people can put keys
[2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:48.040]  on their forehead and make them sit
[2:36:48.040 --> 2:36:50.040]  there.
[2:36:50.040 --> 2:36:52.040]  Stay with us. I can't wait to hear this information.
[2:36:52.040 --> 2:37:19.040]  This is incredible.
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:24.040]  Well, there happens to be a good
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:26.040]  collagen, and it's called iodine.
[2:37:26.040 --> 2:37:28.040]  And we happen to have
[2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:30.040]  the highest quality
[2:37:30.040 --> 2:37:32.040]  formulas of iodine available
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:34.040]  anywhere. We have to have a DEA license
[2:37:34.040 --> 2:37:36.040]  at our manufacturer just to put out
[2:37:36.040 --> 2:37:38.040]  the deep-earth crystals that are in
[2:37:38.040 --> 2:37:40.040]  X2 and X3, both of which are discounted
[2:37:40.040 --> 2:37:42.040]  through the Fourth of July.

[2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:48.040]  60% off for X3 and X3 selling out,
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:50.040]  take advantage of it now.
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:52.040]  What are
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.040]  champions made of?

[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:51.820]  That's info��가.
[2:38:51.820 --> 2:38:53.000]  This is dOR.com
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:57.880]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:02.300]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[2:39:02.300 --> 2:39:03.300]  pass.
[2:39:03.300 --> 2:39:06.660]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you'll understand that they
[2:39:06.660 --> 2:39:10.880]  reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold,
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:12.020]  being totally enslaved.
[2:39:12.020 --> 2:39:15.700]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:16.700]  that move.
[2:39:16.700 --> 2:39:20.800]  They are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:26.440]  third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under
[2:39:26.440 --> 2:39:31.360]  such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:37.040]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:41.640]  change as the UN and Klaus Schwabber is saying and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:47.640]  year long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:53.480]  get more IMF and World Bank money and that's why we have to really get educated about the
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:54.480]  globalist.
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:59.480]  The Fourth of July Super Sale starts now at infowarstores.com.

[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:57.880]  The Fourth of July Super Sale starts now at infowarstores.com.
[2:40:57.880 --> 2:41:18.320]  Start listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:41:18.320 --> 2:41:22.280]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, we had to go to that break because the satellites fired certain
[2:41:22.280 --> 2:41:23.280]  times.
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:26.720]  You were in a cliffhanger about if this is attacking the frontal lobe, if it's attacking
[2:41:26.720 --> 2:41:32.040]  the, you were about to get to that big event and then largest teacher union to debate demanding
[2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:37.080]  vaccinations before returning to in person, demanding all students be injected.
[2:41:37.080 --> 2:41:38.280]  What a suicide cult.
[2:41:38.280 --> 2:41:40.240]  What a Russian roulette situation.
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:45.640]  Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, final segment, please, please lay it all out for folks.
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:50.680]  Somebody needs to put the NEA on notice that if they actually really follow through with
[2:41:50.680 --> 2:41:58.920]  that, that they're going to be sued for a whole litany of things, lying about a shot,
[2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:03.720]  lying about, you know, that these kids are vulnerable and that they're spreading anything.
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:09.120]  Put them on a Nuremberg trial for crimes against humanity.
[2:42:09.120 --> 2:42:13.560]  Somebody needs to sue them upfront before they get any farther with this.
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:16.640]  Because if that happens, then we have to, then they will have to go through the discovery
[2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:22.520]  process and show proof that they're safe and that there are studies that have been done
[2:42:22.520 --> 2:42:27.160]  and that they're safe for 15 to 17 year olds, that they should be given to all kids.
[2:42:27.160 --> 2:42:32.840]  I mean, Indiana came out with a thing a couple of weeks ago that said, if your kids are vaccinated
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:39.200]  in great age groups K through seven, they haven't even gotten to that point yet.
[2:42:39.200 --> 2:42:44.760]  But if they've been injected kindergartners through the seventh grade, then those injected
[2:42:44.760 --> 2:42:49.800]  children who are now marked forever and forever will have their genetics modified and most
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:53.520]  likely will not turn into adult women or adult men.
[2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:58.760]  They will be kind of neutered and be a eunuch as they grow up and will not actually evolve
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:03.800]  into mature adults.
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:08.480]  But if we've injected them, if parents have been stupid enough to inject their children
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.480]  with these technologies, oh, well, then that will give them privileges.
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:14.040]  They won't have to wear a mask.
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:16.120]  They can sit with their friends in the lunchroom.
[2:43:16.120 --> 2:43:17.920]  They can play a musical instrument.
[2:43:17.920 --> 2:43:19.960]  They can play with their friends on recess.
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:21.560]  They can go and play in sports.
[2:43:21.560 --> 2:43:26.080]  And if they have not been injected, they won't be able to do any of those things.
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:30.840]  So now we're separating these kids and making them feel terrible, going home and begging
[2:43:30.840 --> 2:43:33.920]  their parents, crying, begging, pleading, mommy, mommy, please.
[2:43:33.920 --> 2:43:38.200]  This sounds like the plot of the nightmare science fiction horror movie, but it's really
[2:43:38.200 --> 2:43:39.200]  happening.
[2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:41.320]  It's really happening.
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:42.680]  I say that every day, Alex.
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:46.680]  I feel like I really am literally living in the matrix.
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:47.680]  Please continue.
[2:43:47.680 --> 2:43:53.280]  Well, we're seeing that this is, you know, Dr. Larry Pilevsky.
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:58.600]  There's a group of us, Alex, that we've come to refer to ourselves as the 5Ds, the 5 Doctors,
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:00.520]  because we've done a lot of webinars together.
[2:44:00.520 --> 2:44:01.920]  We support each other.
[2:44:01.920 --> 2:44:05.560]  We are colleagues, friends, and we share a lot of information.
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:11.440]  And the 5Ds is me, Dr. Larry Pilevsky, Dr. Christian Northrop, Dr. Lee Merritt, and Dr.
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:12.640]  Larry Maday.
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:17.120]  And these are good doctors fighting Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[2:44:17.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  Absolutely.
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:20.880]  And so we refer to ourselves as the 5Ds.
[2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:25.600]  And Larry is a board-certified pediatrician.
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:30.240]  And Larry has said many, from the beginning, this is not a normal shot.
[2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:31.240]  It's a bioweapon.
[2:44:31.240 --> 2:44:37.720]  Dr. Lee Merritt, who's an orthopedic surgeon, says, and in the military and did a full career
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:40.080]  in the military, said this is a bioweapon.
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:44.720]  Dr. Christian Northrop, who's an OB-GYN, has seen all the bleeding problems, saying this
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:46.440]  is a bioterrorism weapon.
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:50.520]  And it was Dr. Terry Maday, who was the one who first started talking really loudly in
[2:44:50.520 --> 2:44:54.800]  the physician community about the hydrogel in the shots.
[2:44:54.800 --> 2:45:01.480]  And Dr. Larry has said multiple times, if parents get their kids these shots, they can
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:09.040]  absolutely, they're just signing away their rights to ever wanting to become a grandparent.
[2:45:09.040 --> 2:45:13.160]  And if they give these kids these 12 to 15-year-old kids these shots, if they give it to a 12-year-old
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:17.880]  girl who's already started her periods, is anybody going to keep track to see whether
[2:45:17.880 --> 2:45:20.040]  or not she stops them?
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:26.200]  If she hasn't started her periods yet, is anybody going to look to see if she ever does?
[2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:27.440]  What about the little boys?
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:34.200]  What about the little boys that will never grow into men, will never go through puberty?
[2:45:34.200 --> 2:45:37.680]  They won't develop body hair and facial hair and lower their voice and get muscles and
[2:45:37.680 --> 2:45:38.760]  grow tall.
[2:45:38.760 --> 2:45:41.200]  Is anybody going to monitor to see if that happens?
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:45.840]  If we give this to 12-year-old boys, what happens if we don't get females that grow
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:51.240]  into women and boys that don't grow into men and they can't reproduce?
[2:45:51.240 --> 2:45:55.160]  Well, then the fairest people at the top are spending a whole lot of time killing a lot
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:56.680]  of people off from the top.
[2:45:56.680 --> 2:46:03.480]  They certainly don't want to have all of these children repopulate the planet from the bottom.
[2:46:03.480 --> 2:46:05.640]  And they say everywhere, get rid of the humans.
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:07.200]  We need to sterilize everybody.
[2:46:07.200 --> 2:46:10.960]  So they're admitting why they're doing it openly while they do it.
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:15.640]  It's just madness that people are signing their children on for this.
[2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:17.520]  It is absolutely madness.
[2:46:17.520 --> 2:46:22.800]  I see some of these reports about, there was a report, I think it was the other day on
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:28.080]  AOL News, they were celebrating the fact that this little three-year-old girl had been enrolled
[2:46:28.080 --> 2:46:30.760]  in the most recent clinical study.
[2:46:30.760 --> 2:46:35.480]  I think these parents who enroll their kids in these studies and they want these pregnant
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:40.600]  women who allow themselves to get the shot and the babies that they allowed to put into
[2:46:40.600 --> 2:46:46.680]  these roles and all of the children and the teenagers and all of these people, these parents,
[2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:53.600]  I hope eventually all of them will be charged with crimes against humanity and perhaps child
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:55.960]  abuse.
[2:46:55.960 --> 2:46:57.880]  They are testing out depopulation.
[2:46:57.880 --> 2:46:59.200]  They're testing the censorship.
[2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:00.520]  They're testing the control.
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:02.520]  But I think they miscalculated.
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:06.240]  So many medical doctors are coming out, so many people are communicating.
[2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:09.560]  I see fear in Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' face.
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:13.960]  Bill Gates' wife is left him, suddenly Bill Gates has been pulled off TV.
[2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:16.240]  Not all is well inside the New World Order.
[2:47:16.240 --> 2:47:18.680]  Well, I certainly hope that's true.
[2:47:18.680 --> 2:47:24.800]  I'm sure that you saw that graphic that came out about us a while ago now by the Center
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:29.840]  for Digital Hate, which is such an oxymoron name that they came up with it.
[2:47:29.840 --> 2:47:34.360]  They say it's terrorism in Biden's new report to question lockdowns or vaccines.
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:35.360]  That's white supremacism.
[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:38.520]  Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[2:47:38.520 --> 2:47:42.280]  And they named us all as the Disinformation Dozen, right?
[2:47:42.280 --> 2:47:49.360]  So it was me and Del Bigtree and Bobby Kennedy and Christian Northrop, Aaron Elizabeth, Joe
[2:47:49.360 --> 2:47:51.960]  Mercola, a whole bunch of us.
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:56.400]  There were 12 people, you know, Sarah G., Kelly Brogan, I mean, it's just a whole bunch
[2:47:56.400 --> 2:47:57.800]  of us that they just, they called us.
[2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:00.440]  We were the Disinformation Dozen.
[2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:05.800]  And we've added, and we thought, well, wow, they missed a couple of people, you know,
[2:48:05.800 --> 2:48:11.000]  but they blame us for the fact that we are putting out all this information and Biden
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:15.440]  isn't going to reach his 70% of the American population by July 4th.
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:17.280]  I mean, after all, that was the last question.
[2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:21.480]  I don't believe it's even 47% but they admit it's a giant failure for them.
[2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:23.320]  Now they want new lockdowns to make us take it.
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:24.320]  It's not working.
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:28.400]  If people know it's depopulation and we don't just accept it, it's game over.
[2:48:28.400 --> 2:48:30.760]  I see this as a disaster for the globalists.
[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:31.760]  It's going to be terrible.
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:36.160]  People are going to be maimed and died but they're going to know the truth now.
[2:48:36.160 --> 2:48:38.080]  It is sad and it is true.
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:41.360]  I mean, you know, you probably saw this came out a while back now.
[2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:46.200]  The SAGE report, I mean, SAGE is a modeling agency out of the UK.
[2:48:46.200 --> 2:48:50.760]  And the SAGE report said that, you know, in paragraph 32 and paragraph 55 says it quite
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:59.840]  clearly that when the third wave comes, which it will, that 60 to 65 to 70% of people that
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:04.000]  have had two of the shots will be sick, hospitalized, or die.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  65 to 75.
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:07.080]  We're supposed to understand that.
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:10.680]  Why does somebody who's already had it take the shot, get it really sick or already had
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:14.800]  the vaccines, now that makes you run into anything similar, any type of virus, you have
[2:49:14.800 --> 2:49:15.800]  big problems.
[2:49:15.800 --> 2:49:17.300]  What's happening?
[2:49:17.300 --> 2:49:22.000]  It's a process called antibody-dependent enhancement that you develop this antibody.
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.640]  It's a non-binding antibody.
[2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:31.840]  And when you get re-exposed to coronaviruses, that it actually drags the coronavirus into
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:36.960]  your white blood cells and it makes you sicker than you would have ever been if you had never
[2:49:36.960 --> 2:49:37.960]  had the shot.
[2:49:37.960 --> 2:49:44.920]  And it causes massive cytokine storm, massive type, it looks like septic shock, and organ
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:45.920]  system failure.
[2:49:45.920 --> 2:49:51.400]  I mean, we had our first, well, one of the, there's been several, but it had an autopsy
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:56.080]  report of a man, an elderly gentleman who was in perfect health and no medications, got
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:59.720]  the shot in order to go into the hospital and have an elective procedure.
[2:49:59.720 --> 2:50:05.280]  He got exposed in the hospital after he had had the shot to sick people who had COVID.
[2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:08.240]  And he, within several days, massively died.
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:12.320]  And they did an autopsy on him because they couldn't understand why, and found abscesses
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:17.400]  in his lungs, found blood clots, found all kinds of horrific things that had happened
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:18.400]  to him.
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:20.840]  And so the antibody dependent enhancement is real.
[2:50:20.840 --> 2:50:26.000]  It's the reason, Alex, why, all these years that they've been trying to develop a coronavirus
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:31.320]  vaccine by injecting coronaviruses like you would with a flu shot, why they could never
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:36.640]  move it out of animal studies was because the animals got re, when they got re-exposed,
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:38.320]  got very sick and or died.
[2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:39.320]  Sure.
[2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:42.640]  I'm closing because you've got to come back soon, I know you're, why are so many people
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:46.880]  getting herpes or shingles after they take the shot?
[2:50:46.880 --> 2:50:54.400]  I'm not sure what the mechanism, why the exact mechanism of that is, but I'm sure there,
[2:50:54.400 --> 2:50:56.440]  there is something that's releasing these viruses.
[2:50:56.440 --> 2:50:59.560]  I haven't taken the time to dug into that, dig into that yet.
[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:03.600]  We know that we're actually getting those reports, I don't, it's not clear to me yet
[2:51:03.600 --> 2:51:04.600]  why.
[2:51:04.600 --> 2:51:10.920]  All right, Dr. Tin Penny, T-E-N-Penny.com, everybody sign up for the webinar, get it
[2:51:10.920 --> 2:51:15.280]  out and all you that are along with big tech and censorship, remember your fools, you're
[2:51:15.280 --> 2:51:18.960]  not part of the establishment, you're pretending you are, all of us are under attack, left,
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:23.560]  right, gay, straight, old, young, everybody better come together and expose this.
[2:51:23.560 --> 2:51:28.960]  This is Bill Gates' depopulation, DrTinPenny.com, DrTinPenny, we love you, we appreciate you,
[2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:30.840]  please come back sooner, okay?
[2:51:30.840 --> 2:51:35.840]  We'll actually make an effort to do that, Alex, thank you so much for having me on and
[2:51:35.840 --> 2:51:40.120]  I hope that many of your people will come and join us at the webinar in July 10th.
[2:51:40.120 --> 2:51:43.640]  Absolutely, God bless you, thank you, stay with us next hour coming up.
[2:51:43.640 --> 2:51:48.280]  I started taking high-end fish oil and high-end krill oil more than a decade ago because the
[2:51:48.280 --> 2:51:52.560]  scientific literature is overwhelming, it's good for your heart, your brain, your whole
[2:51:52.560 --> 2:51:56.960]  body, your well-being, a lot of folks take it before they take test, people that have
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.440]  arthritis pain, they take it, it's well-known for the things it does for a body, it makes
[2:52:01.440 --> 2:52:03.080]  our lives so much better.
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:08.360]  Then I learned about high-grade fish oil and high-grade krill oil, and we've got both
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:09.360]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:52:09.360 --> 2:52:13.000]  But with the COVID lockdown, supply chains have broken down, so it's been months and
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:15.800]  months and months since we've had krill oil back at Stoff.
[2:52:15.800 --> 2:52:20.400]  But let's back, ladies and gentlemen, and despite the fact that it's already very fairly priced
[2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:25.680]  for the grade it is, highest quality, we're offering it at 40% off for a limited time
[2:52:25.680 --> 2:52:30.640]  at infowarstore.com with free shipping and double-patriot points, because I want those
[2:52:30.640 --> 2:52:33.160]  of you that have already been customers to have a chance to get more of it, and I want
[2:52:33.160 --> 2:52:37.120]  new viewers and listeners who haven't tried it to get it from us, and then try regular
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:40.360]  krill oil that is not one-tenth as powerful as ours.
[2:52:40.360 --> 2:52:47.160]  This is the highest grade back in Stoff, infowarstore.com.
[2:52:47.160 --> 2:52:51.920]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[2:52:51.920 --> 2:53:00.520]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[2:53:00.520 --> 2:53:08.520]  processes of humans, and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[2:53:08.520 --> 2:53:16.000]  worsted slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system, rendered down to be
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:22.240]  servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:27.240]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world, which realizes a nightmare dystopia,
[2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:32.280]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:37.360]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:40.880]  choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[2:53:40.880 --> 2:53:47.880]  It is a spiritual battle, and infowar is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[2:53:47.880 --> 2:54:14.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:54:14.680 --> 2:54:18.040]  Just because the globalists are launching an attack doesn't mean they're all powerful.
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:24.360]  They can't help their attempt to dominate and kill an enslave, it's their satanic instinct.
[2:54:24.360 --> 2:54:28.360]  They're going to fail in all this, but first we're going to go through hellish world government
[2:54:28.360 --> 2:54:33.620]  mark of the beast, the whole nine yards, but our incredible sacking potential connected
[2:54:33.620 --> 2:54:38.160]  to our creator has already given us the keys to victory, we'll only recognize those keys
[2:54:38.160 --> 2:54:42.960]  once we've exhausted all of our own arrogance and realize that only God can save us, and
[2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:49.320]  we will merge and jack into God and complete the circuit, which at a limited level I've
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:53.040]  already done, and I can't believe the satanists have not realized they're already defeated,
[2:54:53.040 --> 2:54:55.080]  they'll find that out.
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:55:00.000]  Jay Dyer is coming up, a smart man, I've got a few questions for him before he takes over
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  in the next segment.
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.840]  Let me throw this at you right now.
[2:55:04.840 --> 2:55:09.800]  Quite frankly, it should be easy for us to fund ourselves with the historic, incredible
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:14.280]  work we're doing, but because of attacks and because of the censorship and because of all
[2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:19.360]  these other reasons, it's hard to keep the funds coming in to even keep info wars on
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:23.040]  air, and I'm not bitching, I'm not complaining, I realize it's all in God's hands and God
[2:55:23.040 --> 2:55:26.320]  works in mysterious ways, but I'll say this.
[2:55:26.320 --> 2:55:31.440]  Our credibility has skyrocketed as everything we talk about happens exactly as we said.
[2:55:31.440 --> 2:55:33.160]  Is it that important information?
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:38.120]  Let's see, a lot of people either go, oh, well this is past say, I already know this,
[2:55:38.120 --> 2:55:42.040]  or this is too horrific, I don't want to believe it.
[2:55:42.040 --> 2:55:47.200]  Well you do that at your own peril, and so I'll just tell you again, if you just made
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:50.920]  straight up donations to us, that's a win-win for everybody to fund the operation.
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:54.920]  You can do that at infowarstore.com, it's a sponsor us, that's the donation page right
[2:55:54.920 --> 2:55:55.920]  there.
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:59.680]  Do a one-time gift or do a recurring, canceling time, but we need your support.
[2:55:59.680 --> 2:56:03.880]  I got a lot of stuff I can do with extra money to really fight these people.
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:08.480]  Or you can just totally give up and roll over, well that's a decision spiritually that cuts
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:09.480]  you off from God.
[2:56:09.480 --> 2:56:12.280]  It's the decision to fight evil that God's looking for.
[2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:16.680]  God's going to come in and take care of it in the end, folks, but it's up to us to really
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:21.280]  show what we can do in the arena, and I'm doing as best I can in the arena, because
[2:56:21.280 --> 2:56:22.280]  I want to go to the next level.
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:24.560]  I do not want to be left with all these pedophiles and Satanists.
[2:56:24.560 --> 2:56:28.760]  I don't want my energy, my soul, my program, who I am to be dumped in with them.
[2:56:28.760 --> 2:56:34.120]  I am literally ready to die, have no fear, anything, to stay away from these people.
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:35.720]  I don't mean I'm suicidal, it's the opposite.
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:41.480]  I mean, I'm willing to do anything to spiritually stay away from the New World Order.
[2:56:41.480 --> 2:56:43.560]  But I need the currency of this planet to do it.
[2:56:43.560 --> 2:56:47.800]  I need a lot of money if I'm to continue this operation in its current form.
[2:56:47.800 --> 2:56:51.880]  And if you don't choose to fund us, that's your decision to say Law of Eve, but we're

[2:57:49.920 --> 2:57:53.640]  you have like the top two, well, that's what we went and got, they're like, wow, they're
[2:57:53.640 --> 2:57:57.320]  cheaper than like other brands that aren't good, yeah, because they don't have a super
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:00.800]  model on the box, they're not sold in box stores, folks, those people don't care about
[2:58:00.800 --> 2:58:04.160]  you, they want to sell you crap, they want to lie to you, that's their mojo, they've
[2:58:04.160 --> 2:58:06.000]  made that decision.

[3:00:08.680 --> 3:00:12.840]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Show, it's the 4th hour, Jay Dyer
[3:00:12.840 --> 3:00:14.520]  is about to take over.
[3:00:14.520 --> 3:00:24.040]  I can tell you that a lot of big news is now starting to break and I'm going to have some
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:26.200]  really huge stories for you.
[3:00:26.200 --> 3:00:30.880]  We're going to be breaking your day at band.video, the URL to share the video, it's a censored
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:35.560]  it's freeworldnews.tv, it's the same site, freeworldnews.tv, they're going to be breaking
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:38.880]  during the war room today, 3 to 6 p.m.
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.320]  Well, Jay Dyer is a great author, I've read several of his books, been aware of him for
[3:00:42.320 --> 3:00:46.800]  over a decade, he's become a good friend of mine, we appreciate him when he can sit in
[3:00:46.800 --> 3:00:51.920]  and give us some of his knowledge during the 4th hour on Thursdays.
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:00:55.040]  But I just wanted to talk about something here for everybody.
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:58.800]  The globalists have knowledge of human potential, but they're afraid of it and want to dumb
[3:00:58.800 --> 3:01:04.120]  the general public down so they can play God and not have competition, whereas they understood
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:07.400]  a raising tide, as Kennedy said, raises all ships.
[3:01:07.400 --> 3:01:11.160]  And people think because they launch a chemical attack or a bio attack or a war, they must
[3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:15.480]  be invincible, they wouldn't have launched this attack, no, they've launched a desperate
[3:01:15.480 --> 3:01:20.880]  depopulation brain damaging program to kill capitalism and what's left of free market
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:25.880]  because their socialist new world order can't compete, their crony capitalist fascist model
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  can't compete with America and people like Bolsonaro or anybody else.
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:38.480]  And so, this is a desperate battering ram thinking that Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:42.640]  and the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers will get away with it thinking that oh, just politicians
[3:01:42.640 --> 3:01:46.000]  did it, but no, we're going to identify the UN, we're going to identify the captains of
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:49.800]  this, we're going to expose them and they're going to be brought to justice one way or
[3:01:49.800 --> 3:01:50.800]  another for what they've done.
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:54.800]  And they've got fear in their eyes now because they had this will, they had this plan, they
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:59.160]  already stole quadrillions and money, they already, you know, decided we're all trash
[3:01:59.160 --> 3:02:04.000]  and they're guardians of the earth, they're going to play God, but see, their plan isn't
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:07.080]  going the way they wanted to in my view and now they're scared.
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:10.680]  And so, Jay Dyer, I just wanted you before you take over here to my question to you and
[3:02:10.680 --> 3:02:18.760]  then I'll just listen off air, do you agree with what I just said A or B, how do you think
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:22.560]  they think they're going to win what they've done when they're going to give us utopia
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:28.120]  saying you'll have nothing, you'll own nothing, we're pedophiles, we love Satan when people
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:32.680]  are now really starting to wake up or is it just an evil instinct and they're not even
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:35.200]  conscious because they're such satanic puppets.
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:37.240]  Jay Dyer, take over.
[3:02:37.240 --> 3:02:42.560]  That's a great question, it's because when we give our wills over to evil, we lose our
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:47.720]  own reasoning, we lose our own notion of being made in the image of God, we basically surrender
[3:02:47.720 --> 3:02:53.400]  ourselves to be tools of something beyond us even if we don't understand that.
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:58.320]  And it's funny you asked because I was just perusing the World Economic Forum's website
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:03.680]  and they've got a couple doozy articles up, the first of which is the idea that we need
[3:03:03.680 --> 3:03:09.200]  a global framework they say to regulate harm online, of course we don't know what harm
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:13.040]  is except that the article goes on to say basically that anybody who disagrees with
[3:03:13.040 --> 3:03:20.360]  Klaus and the World Economic Forum is your harming people, there's no actual science,
[3:03:20.360 --> 3:03:25.560]  no actual evidence of harming people, it's just if you disagree with that narrative.
[3:03:25.560 --> 3:03:31.200]  And even more amazing than that, they have another article up about mRNA vaccines and
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:35.640]  what they are and what will happen as a risk if you take it.
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:42.000]  Yes, the World Economic Forum's website has a pros and cons admission article up right
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:49.360]  now and it says, yeah, look, okay, it does rewrite and change the mRNA sequence.
[3:03:49.360 --> 3:03:54.400]  And it's doing that to, you know, maybe we can make your body make its own vaccine they
[3:03:54.400 --> 3:03:59.680]  say and they go on to admit but there's some cons here, we don't know what this will do.
[3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:03.680]  Now wait a minute, we don't know what this will, that's not actually the case, first
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:10.200]  of all, because as I think Info Wars was last week, they already knew what would happen
[3:04:10.200 --> 3:04:15.400]  when this pandemic so-called happened, when it occurred that they would rush out these
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:20.320]  already planned so-called vaccines which are not actually vaccines, right?
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:27.080]  It's an experimental gene therapy drug basically, it's poison and when you look at their website
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:30.920]  they admit that, right, it talks about the cons, it says, we do not know, there are many
[3:04:30.920 --> 3:04:33.200]  risks and unknowns.
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:39.360]  Now how is that misinformation when their own website says it's dangerous and then
[3:04:39.360 --> 3:04:43.920]  they have another article on the same front page saying that if you disagree with their
[3:04:43.920 --> 3:04:50.480]  assessments and the mandates, you are harming people, I mean it's completely ridiculous.
[3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:54.760]  So basic logic would be able to tell you that if they're going to have propaganda on the
[3:04:54.760 --> 3:04:58.640]  one hand that tells you and admits all the stuff, by the way, remember a year ago?
[3:04:58.640 --> 3:05:03.880]  I remember listening to Alex, I was driving on the interstate a year ago and even I thought
[3:05:03.880 --> 3:05:04.920]  this was too crazy.
[3:05:04.920 --> 3:05:13.520]  I remember Alex specifically doing a show about Gavi and mRNA vaccines and I thought
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:19.360]  that's just too, this is too wild, there's no way they would literally roll out a vaccination
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:27.360]  program so-called that would have this mutagen effect, right, within the vaccine and people
[3:05:27.360 --> 3:05:30.320]  would like, well people would know this, they would figure this out, right, no they did
[3:05:30.320 --> 3:05:31.520]  it.
[3:05:31.520 --> 3:05:35.560]  And by the way, when Alex first said that a year ago, right, when the COOFID started
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:39.920]  happening, they said, no, there's not going to be any mandatory vaccines, no, that'll
[3:05:39.920 --> 3:05:46.720]  never happen, that's crazy if you think that's coming, what, what, no, what, and then here
[3:05:46.720 --> 3:05:47.720]  it comes.
[3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:51.840]  Oh, there'll never be vaccine passports, oh, then it comes.
[3:05:51.840 --> 3:05:58.120]  Now go to the World Economic Forum's website, despite the benefits of mRNA vaccines, there
[3:05:58.120 --> 3:06:02.480]  are risks and unknowns.
[3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:08.920]  And yes, it is changing the mRNA sequence, it says that we could just simply rewrite
[3:06:08.920 --> 3:06:09.920]  your genetics.
[3:06:09.920 --> 3:06:15.800]  Now wait a minute, I thought that was a crazy conspiracy theory and yet it's admitted on
[3:06:15.800 --> 3:06:18.080]  the website.
[3:06:18.080 --> 3:06:24.040]  Now if we, if we look at the documents that they put out, if we look at the gas lighting,
[3:06:24.040 --> 3:06:28.240]  we look at the gas lighting, we look at what they put out, it's all in the open.
[3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:32.160]  They telegraphed all of this, right, from the plans that they already have, from the
[3:06:32.160 --> 3:06:36.840]  leaks of the Wuhan lab to the SPARS document to all the documents that came out, this is
[3:06:36.840 --> 3:06:41.760]  all foreknown, it was all war-gamed, planned and strategized out.
[3:06:41.760 --> 3:06:43.320]  And then they rolled it out.
[3:06:43.320 --> 3:06:46.640]  And now we can look back and see it all in perfect sequence.
[3:06:46.640 --> 3:06:51.760]  Remember when Kissinger said, this is just the first act of a play when they talked about
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:54.200]  overthrowing the Egyptian government.
[3:06:54.200 --> 3:06:58.280]  This is what they do, this is how it works, they roll this stuff out.
[3:06:58.280 --> 3:07:00.240]  But today we're going to do something a little bit different.
[3:07:00.240 --> 3:07:04.080]  We have a friend of mine, a good friend that I've known for a long time, who actually helped
[3:07:04.080 --> 3:07:09.200]  me in terms of getting my diet and health better, and his name is Tristan Haggard.
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:14.760]  He is a homesteader, proponent of self-sovereignty, food sovereignty, self-sufficiency, health
[3:07:14.760 --> 3:07:18.760]  freedom, and him and his wife run primaledgehealth.com.
[3:07:18.760 --> 3:07:22.960]  And their goal is to help people take back their health freedom.
[3:07:22.960 --> 3:07:27.760]  Tristan is a YouTuber, he has a nice, successful YouTube channel.
[3:07:27.760 --> 3:07:33.600]  He's also over on Rockfinn, a free speech platform where you can find me as well.
[3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:37.720]  And so Tristan, what I'd like to talk to you about today is one thing that a lot of people
[3:07:37.720 --> 3:07:41.920]  don't know about is the diet attack.
[3:07:41.920 --> 3:07:43.360]  And you know a lot about this.
[3:07:43.360 --> 3:07:48.360]  You taught me a lot about this element of the New World Order agenda, and that's to
[3:07:48.360 --> 3:07:49.360]  attack diet.
[3:07:49.360 --> 3:07:54.680]  We know people like Bertrand Russell, we know people like Charles Galton Darwin, they wrote
[3:07:54.680 --> 3:08:01.320]  entire books about how the technocratic elite would have to go after people's diet and food.
[3:08:01.320 --> 3:08:04.680]  Tell us about that, tell us about social engineering, why are they doing this?
[3:08:04.680 --> 3:08:05.680]  Absolutely, Jay.
[3:08:05.680 --> 3:08:09.440]  First of all, thank you so much for having me on, man, it is great to talk to you here.
[3:08:09.440 --> 3:08:14.520]  I've heard of this guy, Alex Jones, maybe in passing, so I'm glad that he's connecting
[3:08:14.520 --> 3:08:17.040]  with the big wigs like you up in the game, Jay.
[3:08:17.040 --> 3:08:19.800]  So yeah, man, I mean, food is a major part of this.
[3:08:19.800 --> 3:08:24.240]  I think a lot of people recognize the push for the genetic modification of food, which
[3:08:24.240 --> 3:08:27.640]  we saw especially ramped up in the 90s and the 2000s.
[3:08:27.640 --> 3:08:32.600]  Of course, this was facilitated in large part by huge grants from, guess who, everybody's
[3:08:32.600 --> 3:08:36.840]  favorite philanthropic and never the Rockefeller Foundation, right?
[3:08:36.840 --> 3:08:41.560]  The Carnegie's, the Rockefellers have been having their eye on our food supply for a
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:47.800]  long time, manipulating not only the markets, commodities markets, imports and exports,
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:51.520]  but also manipulating the very genetics of our food, right?
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:55.040]  So I think there's a really good starting point for people to understand kind of the
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:09:00.120]  deep politics landscape that you're looking at when you're considering what types of food
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:03.360]  you're buying and how this is going to affect not only your health, but the health of your
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:04.840]  communities as well.
[3:09:04.840 --> 3:09:09.120]  It would be F. William Engdahl's book, The Seeds of Destruction.
[3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:11.880]  Something that he references in that book that I think will shock a lot of people is
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:19.040]  that on September 9th of 2001, the company EpiSight, and you guys can find this article
[3:09:19.040 --> 3:09:25.360]  at theethoguardian.com, EpiSight actually announced that they have a, quote, GM corn
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:29.600]  set to stop man spreading his seed, right?
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:35.640]  It's a genetically modified corn that was actually contraceptive, a contraceptive corn
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:40.600]  that this would actually create antibodies, human antibodies that will attack sperm.
[3:09:40.600 --> 3:09:43.840]  Hold on a thought there, Tristan, we're going to break coming up.
[3:09:43.840 --> 3:09:48.560]  So yeah, Terminator Seeds, definitely something that is a big red flag.
[3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:49.560]  We'll be right back.
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:09:50.560]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:51.560]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:09:51.560 --> 3:10:02.160]  July 4th, 2021 is now upon us and that means our yearly big sale is here.
[3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:08.520]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points starts right now and runs through July 4th.

[3:10:36.920 --> 3:10:41.200]  infowarsstore.com because there's going to be new specials of select items with free

[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:54.720]  The most important thing I've done in the last eight years for my health, for my middle
[3:10:54.720 --> 3:10:59.000]  clarity, for my focus has been deep earth crystal iodine.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:03.840]  Dr. Group hammered me and hammered me nine, 10 years ago and said Alex you've got to start
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:09.520]  taking deep earth crystal atomic iodine and when I finally started taking it, it changed
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:10.720]  my life.
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:15.560]  Even the UN's own health website admits over two million people have cognitive disabilities,
[3:11:15.560 --> 3:11:18.880]  lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:23.720]  Well we have two varieties of high quality iodine that will blow you away on sale right
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:24.720]  now.
[3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:29.600]  X2 there's deep earth crystal iodine and X3 there's tri iodine, deep earth crystal iodine
[3:11:29.600 --> 3:11:30.600]  and two other types.
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:32.600]  So some people need all three types of absorptions.
[3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:36.560]  So it's apples and oranges, two different formulas, some people like one better or the
[3:11:36.560 --> 3:11:37.560]  other.
[3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:40.000]  But the point is they're all discounted right now.
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:45.840]  50% off for X2, 60% off for X3, with free shipping, double pay for your points through
[3:11:45.840 --> 3:11:46.840]  the process you're live.

[3:11:54.760 --> 3:12:14.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:17.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on your guest host, J. Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:23.240]  And I want to remind everybody to go to the InfoWars store and help support this tip of
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:27.040]  the spear free media enterprise.
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:31.920]  This is the tip of the spear and if you don't support InfoWars we won't be here to help take
[3:12:31.920 --> 3:12:39.480]  down this degenerate, disgusting elite that is trying to destroy the planet.
[3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:46.520]  My guest is Tristan of Primal Edge Health and Tristan you were just talking about the
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:52.920]  Terminator seeds and one of the key things that you really hit me to was the vegan agenda.
[3:12:52.920 --> 3:12:57.960]  Now I had read a couple books by the global elite for example Alvin Toffler has a book
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:13:02.720]  that he wrote a long time ago where he said that in the future they would combine veganism
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:07.440]  with the New World Order agenda to try to control people's diets.
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:11.360]  Tell us about the vegan agenda, why this is so dangerous and why it's not merely some
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:14.360]  health choice that people make to live better.
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:15.360]  Right, absolutely.
[3:13:15.360 --> 3:13:20.200]  Well, I mean, me personally, I inherit the distress, anything that's promoted by the
[3:13:20.200 --> 3:13:29.840]  likes of Jay-Z, Beyonce, 17 Magazine, Billie Eilash and these degenerate, you know, hourish
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:34.960]  celebrities who will hoard their bodies, their minds or souls out, you know, for any agenda
[3:13:34.960 --> 3:13:36.480]  that they're told to push.
[3:13:36.480 --> 3:13:41.240]  Now that's not a reason to of course, you know, change your diet just because a celebrity
[3:13:41.240 --> 3:13:47.040]  endorses or doesn't endorse something but we've seen this pattern of global corporations,
[3:13:47.040 --> 3:13:51.520]  you know, big money foundations, Rockefeller Foundation, you know, Harvard pushing through
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:55.880]  genetically modified seeds, right, we just talked about the terminator seeds, to terminate
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:14:00.640]  your seeds, right, to terminate your ability to reproduce and of course there are other
[3:14:00.640 --> 3:14:02.600]  ways that you can regulate reproduction.
[3:14:02.600 --> 3:14:06.680]  So one of the reasons I believe that we are seeing such a huge push of this so-called
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:13.160]  vegan agenda plant-based is how it's being branded now or flexitarian diets, right.
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:17.520]  The idea that eating less meat is going to result in you becoming not only a better and
[3:14:17.520 --> 3:14:21.960]  superior moral person or more spiritual person but also you're going to save the planet and
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:22.960]  you're going to be healthier.
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:25.080]  Well, this is absolute hogwash.
[3:14:25.080 --> 3:14:29.800]  When you look at who actually lives the longest, the longest living population in the world
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:34.840]  actually eats the most meat per capita, right, that's Hong Kong, Hong Kong consumes the
[3:14:34.840 --> 3:14:38.760]  most meat per capita of any population right now, they live the longest.
[3:14:38.760 --> 3:14:42.560]  So this myth of meat's going to bring you longevity, cholesterol is bad.
[3:14:42.560 --> 3:14:46.480]  When you look at centenarians, people who live over 100 years, guess what, they all
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:48.480]  have high cholesterol.
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:54.000]  Low cholesterol is associated with all cause mortality increases, right, increases in
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:15:00.040]  cancer, infectious diseases, right, you see an increase across the board of death when
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:04.320]  you have low cholesterol and what is your doctor always telling you when you go in and
[3:15:04.320 --> 3:15:08.320]  you get tested, oh, your cholesterol is high, we're going to have to give you a statin.
[3:15:08.320 --> 3:15:10.240]  What are the side effects of statins?
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:16.800]  So degeneration, degenerative bone conditions, right, weakening of your joints, you're more
[3:15:16.800 --> 3:15:23.720]  prone to injury, forgetfulness, like everything that you see just ravaging people, especially
[3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:27.600]  in the older age groups, these are all exacerbated by statins.
[3:15:27.600 --> 3:15:33.320]  So when you look at fertility as well, anybody who's got animals, especially if you live
[3:15:33.320 --> 3:15:36.600]  somewhere like high up in the mountains, we've got a bunch of cows, we've got sheep
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:40.920]  and we understand that it's especially important to get proper mineral balance and have proper
[3:15:40.920 --> 3:15:42.640]  minerals in your animals.
[3:15:42.640 --> 3:15:47.240]  If your animals are infertile, there is something that you do first, one of the first things
[3:15:47.240 --> 3:15:53.840]  you do if your cow is not getting pregnant, you give them an injection with iodine, selenium
[3:15:53.840 --> 3:15:58.960]  and zinc, okay, zinc is crucial not only for sperm production in the male but also for
[3:15:58.960 --> 3:16:01.360]  fertility in the female, iodine as well.
[3:16:01.360 --> 3:16:07.200]  When you decrease the consumption of animal foods, you see a massive decrease in fertility
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:14.000]  due to the associated decrease in these necessary minerals and vitamins that you get only from
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:19.360]  animal foods, right, vitamins like vitamin B12, iodine.
[3:16:19.360 --> 3:16:30.840]  Right, now I was watching one of the recent diehard installments, I think it was the diehard
[3:16:30.840 --> 3:16:36.560]  five, I think, and they had that plot where there was a back door that was basically like
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:42.360]  put into, you know, all of the tech stuff, all the, more or less the promiss NSA type
[3:16:42.360 --> 3:16:46.800]  software and if you remember the plot, you know, John McLean had to basically stop this
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:52.720]  private secret intelligence group that was crashing the stock market, disrupting supply
[3:16:52.720 --> 3:16:57.680]  chain logistics and it reminded me that lo and behold, what does Klaus say right a few
[3:16:57.680 --> 3:17:03.520]  weeks ago, there will be disruptions to the food, there will be the cyber-polygon attack,
[3:17:03.520 --> 3:17:08.040]  they will take down the logistics of America, there will not be food production, right,
[3:17:08.040 --> 3:17:14.000]  so he told us and then magically it happens, right, we see this disruption in the, you
[3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:19.920]  know, there was the pipeline situation and there was the meat production situation, so
[3:17:19.920 --> 3:17:24.440]  it's almost like they telegraph these kinds of things ahead of time as well and then we
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:30.400]  see a play out where they actually have these war games and then I think they're run, they're
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:35.520]  staged, they're done on purpose and so, you know, this is the next thing that Klaus has
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:40.160]  talked about at the World Economic Forum is running this war game of cyber-polygon which
[3:17:40.160 --> 3:17:47.040]  is preparing for widespread internet outages and so what I want to ask you about that is
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:52.480]  why do they see such an importance in terms of attacking not just the food chain and supply,
[3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:56.880]  but the food supply chain, but they specifically are going after meat, if you remember it was
[3:17:56.880 --> 3:18:03.400]  I think 2020, Jay-Z and Beyonce announced that this is the year of the vegan, the economist
[3:18:03.400 --> 3:18:08.280]  put on the front of the magazine, this was the year of the vegan, why is this so important
[3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:09.280]  in the revolution?
[3:18:09.280 --> 3:18:14.600]  Is it just as you said to try to weaken people or is it actually a movement towards depopulation
[3:18:14.600 --> 3:18:15.600]  and sterilization?
[3:18:15.600 --> 3:18:20.920]  Well, yeah, like we were just talking about depopulation and sterilization are definitely
[3:18:20.920 --> 3:18:24.120]  a part of this, but I think it's about far more than that.
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:26.520]  The only foods that you're going to be, if you're going to try to feed yourself on your
[3:18:26.520 --> 3:18:31.280]  own land, if you're going to try to be self-sustained as, you know, small farms, small family farm
[3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:36.200]  or homesteader, the only foods that you can actually live off of on your own land are
[3:18:36.200 --> 3:18:37.680]  going to be animal foods.
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:42.480]  You can't live exclusively off of any plant foods without heavy supplementation, right,
[3:18:42.480 --> 3:18:49.400]  a vitamin B12, zinc, iodine, you cannot live off of just plant foods without supplementation
[3:18:49.400 --> 3:18:51.120]  and pharmaceutical drugs.
[3:18:51.120 --> 3:18:56.320]  So I think it's a part of the agenda, both to weaken the population, to weaken our immune
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:19:01.160]  system and to make us unable to feed ourselves on our own land, right.
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:05.360]  Bill Gates and all these big investment banks are investing in fake meat.
[3:19:05.360 --> 3:19:09.720]  They've been pushing the beyond burger trash that nobody actually wants, right, and they're
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:14.760]  going to try to price out, and they've actually talked about this publicly, Pat Brown, the
[3:19:14.760 --> 3:19:21.320]  CEO of Impossible Inc. that makes the Impossible Burger, which contains a GMO soy leg hemoglobin,
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:25.520]  fake hemoglobin genetically modified organism in there that's never been tested on human
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:26.520]  beings.
[3:19:26.520 --> 3:19:29.640]  That actually could be incredibly dangerous, could, I think it had some really negative
[3:19:29.640 --> 3:19:30.840]  results in rat studies.
[3:19:30.840 --> 3:19:36.200]  He says that he wants to completely eliminate animal foods from the human diet by, I believe,
[3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:37.200]  2050.
[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:40.720]  So his idea is we're going to make animal foods obsolete.
[3:19:40.720 --> 3:19:46.440]  Now, when you look at the Rockefeller Foundation's population report, it was commissioned by,
[3:19:46.440 --> 3:19:50.520]  I think it was Kissinger that commissioned that, and they actually say, we need to move
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:54.560]  people away from eating foods that are produced locally and towards eating foods that are
[3:19:54.560 --> 3:19:57.080]  made in factories, and that's what it's about.
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:19:58.520]  It's about dependence.
[3:19:58.520 --> 3:20:03.600]  It's about dominance, and it's also about degenerating, you physically degenerating
[3:20:03.600 --> 3:20:08.560]  your, you culturally, and destroying self-sustained rural populations.
[3:20:08.560 --> 3:20:10.420]  And this is what you saw in the Hall of D'Amour.
[3:20:10.420 --> 3:20:15.080]  You had the black soil areas of the Ukraine where they had the highest food production.
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:21.360]  It was the bread basket of Europe, and those people starved in the most horrific and dehumanizing
[3:20:21.360 --> 3:20:22.360]  way.
[3:20:22.360 --> 3:20:28.440]  They were murdered through governmental policies of quarantine, and of isolation, and of destruction
[3:20:28.440 --> 3:20:31.800]  of their ability to feed themselves on their own land.
[3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:32.800]  So this is what it's about.
[3:20:32.800 --> 3:20:34.320]  It's about population control.
[3:20:34.320 --> 3:20:37.800]  It's about food control, and it's about resource accumulation.
[3:20:37.800 --> 3:20:40.760]  Hold that thought there, Tristan.
[3:20:40.760 --> 3:20:41.760]  We'll be back in just a moment.
[3:20:41.760 --> 3:20:43.280]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[3:20:43.280 --> 3:20:46.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:46.160 --> 3:20:47.160]  Don't Go Anywhere.
[3:20:47.160 --> 3:20:48.160]  We'll be back.
[3:20:48.160 --> 3:20:50.880]  This is like dissecting the vegan propaganda with-
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:56.120]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:20:56.120 --> 3:21:01.720]  because I sit there, and I beg you for support constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:07.080]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together, and it gets old having to come to
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:10.360]  me and say, hey, I got these great products, please, buy them, or we won't be here on air.
[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:11.360]  But it's true.
[3:21:11.360 --> 3:21:15.080]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:21:15.080 --> 3:21:19.040]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and almost shut down
[3:21:19.040 --> 3:21:20.040]  everybody else.
[3:21:20.040 --> 3:21:24.000]  They crippled all the other groups, and we're still here, and as this whole new world order
[3:21:24.000 --> 3:21:26.900]  comes out and we open, our credibility's going up.
[3:21:26.900 --> 3:21:28.400]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:30.520]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:21:30.520 --> 3:21:34.080]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:38.840]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, and yet on air, with all the craziness that's
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:39.840]  about to unfold.
[3:21:39.840 --> 3:21:42.160]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:21:42.160 --> 3:21:47.200]  So thank you all, and get in the infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements
[3:21:47.200 --> 3:21:48.200]  and so much more.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:51.520]  They're wonderful products, and they support the info war, thank you.
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:53.960]  The world is awakening.
[3:21:53.960 --> 3:21:57.480]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[3:21:57.480 --> 3:22:02.840]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[3:22:02.840 --> 3:22:08.800]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the club of Rome.
[3:22:08.800 --> 3:22:13.960]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is, they've had to
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:18.560]  come out of the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:21.680]  We have forced them out in the open.
[3:22:21.680 --> 3:22:25.920]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize
[3:22:25.920 --> 3:22:27.560]  humanity is winning.
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:32.680]  You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[3:22:32.680 --> 3:22:34.120]  That is invincible.
[3:22:34.120 --> 3:22:37.400]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[3:22:37.400 --> 3:22:42.320]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action
[3:22:42.320 --> 3:22:46.240]  against the globalists and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew
[3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:47.240]  to you.
[3:22:47.240 --> 3:22:51.440]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[3:22:51.440 --> 3:22:56.240]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:22:56.240 --> 3:22:58.960]  for beta testing to operational.
[3:22:58.960 --> 3:23:03.720]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:04.720]  takeover.
[3:23:04.720 --> 3:23:07.840]  But the good news is, we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been
[3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:12.760]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:23:12.760 --> 3:23:16.880]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[3:23:16.880 --> 3:23:18.400]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:21.040]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:23:21.040 --> 3:23:25.240]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[3:23:25.240 --> 3:23:27.040]  others is absolutely essential.
[3:23:27.040 --> 3:23:31.560]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:35.200]  on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're

[3:24:54.320 --> 3:25:24.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:31.560]  We were talking about Bill Gates and the elites, the billionaires plan to voice upon
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:37.000]  us all a so-called vegan diet, which is not a diet at all, it's actually a nutrient deficient
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  diet.
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:42.560]  I was just reminded of the fact that Plato, if you go back to the Republic, Plato talked
[3:25:42.560 --> 3:25:48.240]  about controlling society in a very top-down technocratic way, even to the extent that
[3:25:48.240 --> 3:25:52.240]  you can't feed the plebs, the prols, the worker class meat.
[3:25:52.240 --> 3:25:54.960]  He said, just give them grains, basically.
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:58.000]  He says, if you give them meats, they're going to get strong, they're going to be able to
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:01.480]  overthrow your top-down tyranny.
[3:26:01.480 --> 3:26:02.480]  So Plato knew this.
[3:26:02.480 --> 3:26:07.000]  The elites have done this for a long time, that you can control the masses through diet.
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:14.360]  It's an old plan, Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells, all these people just basically regurgitated.
[3:26:14.360 --> 3:26:19.880]  This old plan of how to keep people in a weak, dumbed-down, stupid state, and a big part
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:21.480]  of that, a huge part of that is diet.
[3:26:21.480 --> 3:26:26.680]  I'm glad you mentioned the State Department memorandum 200 from Kissinger.
[3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:29.480]  Food has been a long-time tool of warfare.
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:33.480]  It's a form of warfare, just like there's economic warfare, just like there's physical,
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:35.280]  kinetic warfare, whatever.
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:37.640]  There's also food warfare.
[3:26:37.640 --> 3:26:45.040]  One thing that I want to mention is the notion that this is something ethical, that this
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:48.640]  is the next stage of revolution and fighting the man.
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:53.480]  A lot of these vegans, you and I have had some pretty hilarious so-called debates with
[3:26:53.480 --> 3:26:57.760]  the burgeoning YouTube community of vegans.
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:00.280]  One of the things that comes to the fore is that they all think that they're fighting
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:06.520]  at the forefront of a revolution against the man, against this basically serial killer
[3:27:06.520 --> 3:27:10.320]  attitude of raping nature and all this kind of stuff.
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:16.920]  But in reality, they're actually the forefront of a billionaire-funded dysgenics operation.
[3:27:16.920 --> 3:27:21.160]  It's a totally fake, unreal, inauthentic revolution.
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:24.480]  Could you speak to that?
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:27.600]  You see this push now.
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:32.720]  Even within the mainstream, like in the EU, for instance, this was just announced yesterday.
[3:27:32.720 --> 3:27:38.840]  Caged animal farming in the EU, they're aiming to end the practice of so-called caged animal
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:39.840]  farming.
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:44.920]  Now, anybody who's seen how a lot of the intensive agriculture, like the so-called factory farms
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:50.080]  function, understands that there's something wrong with this Tyson Foods model of producing
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:51.080]  meat.
[3:27:51.080 --> 3:27:52.080]  Well, guess what?
[3:27:52.080 --> 3:27:56.000]  Tyson Foods was also one of the biggest investors in the Beyond Burger and Beyond Meat, right?
[3:27:56.000 --> 3:27:57.480]  This multi-billion dollar company.
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:27:59.320]  You've also funded by Bill Gates, right?
[3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:04.040]  So now the EU is actually using this animal welfare rhetoric that you hear from a lot
[3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:05.040]  of the vegans.
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:09.720]  Here's a quote from the EU health commissioner, Stella Kiriakides.
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:14.840]  She says, animals are sentient beings, and we have a moral societal responsibility to
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:18.720]  ensure that on-farm conditions for animals reflect this.
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:24.680]  Now, on the surface, this doesn't sound bad, but this type of legislation is being pushed
[3:28:24.680 --> 3:28:29.080]  all over the place, which makes it more and more difficult for farmers to, number one,
[3:28:29.080 --> 3:28:33.920]  turn a profit without taking out huge loans from, say, the IMF and World Bank, which was
[3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:39.200]  always the predatory model pushed on the third world to convert them to producing GMO seeds.
[3:28:39.200 --> 3:28:43.800]  But it also makes it much more difficult for anybody to meet the constantly shifting and
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:48.840]  changing standards that these government dictators will dictate, right?
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:52.360]  So you have to have big money in order to actually turn a profit.
[3:28:52.360 --> 3:28:56.040]  So the goal is not to actually bring about animal welfare.
[3:28:56.040 --> 3:29:00.160]  It's to bring about more control over the food supply.
[3:29:00.160 --> 3:29:05.000]  And you also see this in these animal rights organizations that actually have a lot of
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:08.240]  political power in various countries, including Australia.
[3:29:08.240 --> 3:29:15.200]  So there's the Animal Rights Party, which actually seeks to give animal rights, give
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:20.160]  animals a new definition of legal personhood in Australia.
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:22.880]  They're doing this in the Netherlands as well.
[3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:28.680]  So just like you see AI being given personhood in Saudi Arabia, by the way, a lot of these
[3:29:28.680 --> 3:29:31.600]  Saudi princes are also involved in funding companies.
[3:29:31.600 --> 3:29:32.600]  Right.
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:36.360]  Doesn't one of these Saudi princes who famously tosses midgets, isn't he behind the promotion
[3:29:36.360 --> 3:29:37.360]  of this?
[3:29:37.360 --> 3:29:38.360]  Exactly.
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:39.360]  Exactly.
[3:29:39.360 --> 3:29:41.760]  So Jay, I know you've been watching my channel on YouTube for a long time, which I've been
[3:29:41.760 --> 3:29:45.360]  documenting this takeover of our food supply for years now.
[3:29:45.360 --> 3:29:51.280]  Guys like Saudi Prince Awalid bin Talal, the midgets tossing billionaire.
[3:29:51.280 --> 3:29:55.080]  I think it was a famous Forbes article that talked about him.
[3:29:55.080 --> 3:29:56.640]  He, his son.
[3:29:56.640 --> 3:29:57.640]  Yeah.
[3:29:57.640 --> 3:30:00.840]  His son actually invested heavily in Beyond Meat.
[3:30:00.840 --> 3:30:03.120]  He's also invested in lab grown meat, Memphis meat.
[3:30:03.120 --> 3:30:07.760]  So this idea that, oh, you don't have to hurt an animal, we can just grow cell-cultured
[3:30:07.760 --> 3:30:10.840]  precision fermentation meat in a laboratory.
[3:30:10.840 --> 3:30:13.000]  And we'll give you extra carbon credits for this.
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:15.880]  This all ties in with this new UN agenda 2030.
[3:30:15.880 --> 3:30:22.800]  Well, it's an old agenda, but this dictation, this dictatorial agenda where they want to
[3:30:22.800 --> 3:30:26.480]  control every single bit of matter on this planet.
[3:30:26.480 --> 3:30:31.440]  They want to control every food you eat, every seed that is grown, tracked and traced
[3:30:31.440 --> 3:30:34.960]  from source to, to its end point.
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:37.040]  And they even want to weigh your poo poo in smart toilets.
[3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:39.720]  And they'll tell you whether you had too much protein or not.
[3:30:39.720 --> 3:30:44.080]  Or maybe you've, you know, if you exceeded your, your natural testosterone levels a little
[3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:48.840]  bit, sir, we're going to have to give you a special, a special soy cake so we can decrease
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:53.120]  your possible aggression towards, towards the, the good authorities and the experts
[3:30:53.120 --> 3:30:54.120]  of the science.
[3:30:54.120 --> 3:30:55.120]  All right.
[3:30:55.120 --> 3:30:57.360]  So this is not about actually animal rights.
[3:30:57.360 --> 3:30:58.800]  It's about dehumanizing people.
[3:30:58.800 --> 3:31:04.760]  And I just like giving the AI robot, Sophia, human personhood in Saudi Arabia is not about,
[3:31:04.760 --> 3:31:10.080]  you know, all the great wonders of technology, look how, how technology can serve us.
[3:31:10.080 --> 3:31:12.840]  It's about dehumanizing man, right?
[3:31:12.840 --> 3:31:15.120]  Which I know you and I both talked about this quite a bit.
[3:31:15.120 --> 3:31:17.000]  This goes beyond just what we eat.
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:21.880]  It also goes deeper than that at the fundamental level of how we see ourselves, our place in
[3:31:21.880 --> 3:31:22.880]  the universe.
[3:31:22.880 --> 3:31:27.080]  Are we made in the image and likeness of God, or are you just a monkey that should be treated
[3:31:27.080 --> 3:31:32.360]  like a lab rat and, and should chickens have the same rights as your children?
[3:31:32.360 --> 3:31:33.360]  Right.
[3:31:33.360 --> 3:31:36.080]  Now these same animal rights organizations that are out there saying, we're going to
[3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:37.680]  protect the animals like PETA.
[3:31:37.680 --> 3:31:38.680]  All right.
[3:31:38.680 --> 3:31:41.560]  PETA is well known to get stray dogs and euthanize them.
[3:31:41.560 --> 3:31:43.960]  They promote the euthanization of these animals.
[3:31:43.960 --> 3:31:46.880]  So they're telling you, yeah, we're going to give these animals rights.
[3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:47.880]  We love these animals.
[3:31:47.880 --> 3:31:49.080]  We want to protect the animals.
[3:31:49.080 --> 3:31:53.080]  But all these animal rights organizations are also involved in mass sterilization and
[3:31:53.080 --> 3:31:54.760]  euthanization of these animals.
[3:31:54.760 --> 3:31:55.760]  Right.
[3:31:55.760 --> 3:31:59.680]  So this is ultimately the goal, is not just giving animals rights.
[3:31:59.680 --> 3:32:03.320]  It's about giving you animal rights.
[3:32:03.320 --> 3:32:08.120]  I remember walking into a Whole Foods a year ago and outside on the way out, there was
[3:32:08.120 --> 3:32:13.600]  a big food truck that had pulled up and it was this new latest lab produced, I'm not
[3:32:13.600 --> 3:32:16.560]  joking, vegan pizza.
[3:32:16.560 --> 3:32:23.120]  And the hilarious part literally was that around the food truck was all of these sprinkled
[3:32:23.120 --> 3:32:24.960]  tossed out pieces of pizza.
[3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:28.680]  They were giving them out free and people had just tossed them on the ground.
[3:32:28.680 --> 3:32:30.320]  It looked like it was raining pizza.
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:33.840]  There was so many just thrown out because it was so terrible.
[3:32:33.840 --> 3:32:38.200]  Don't we just feed that trash to, I wouldn't even feed that to my pigs, wouldn't even feed
[3:32:38.200 --> 3:32:39.200]  that to my pigs.
[3:32:39.200 --> 3:32:40.200]  Nobody could eat it.
[3:32:40.200 --> 3:32:41.200]  It was hilarious.
[3:32:41.200 --> 3:32:43.440]  I should have taken a picture because it would have been a great way to refute the whole
[3:32:43.440 --> 3:32:44.440]  vegan thing.
[3:32:44.440 --> 3:32:45.960]  Humans don't want this.
[3:32:45.960 --> 3:32:50.880]  They just throw it on the ground right next to the food truck even when it's free.
[3:32:50.880 --> 3:32:56.480]  So it makes me just laugh really when you think, and Bertrand Russell, remember in Scientific
[3:32:56.480 --> 3:33:01.120]  Outlook, he says that in the future, in the technocratic dystopia, the elite will eat
[3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:02.120]  real steaks.
[3:33:02.120 --> 3:33:06.240]  They'll have their own secret underground steak meals.
[3:33:06.240 --> 3:33:07.880]  You will be eating the fake synthetic.
[3:33:07.880 --> 3:33:13.720]  He said 100 years ago there would be synthetic fake meat and now they're making these beyond
[3:33:13.720 --> 3:33:16.000]  burgers that bleed with fake blood.
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:17.600]  This is just preposterous.
[3:33:17.600 --> 3:33:22.520]  Even that, there's even a sign up, even how they frame that because when you actually
[3:33:22.520 --> 3:33:24.320]  have a burger, that's not blood.
[3:33:24.320 --> 3:33:26.000]  The blood is in the veins of the animal.
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:30.320]  When you see those juices that come from a burger, if you take a rib eye and it's raw,
[3:33:30.320 --> 3:33:31.320]  you cut that thing open.
[3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:32.840]  There's not a single drop of blood.
[3:33:32.840 --> 3:33:37.520]  You cook it in the myoglobin, which now they're making fake, they call it leg hemoglobin.
[3:33:37.520 --> 3:33:47.080]  That's how they think that chickens have eggs in their period and you're raping chickens.
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:48.600]  What could you speak, by the way?
[3:33:48.600 --> 3:33:53.040]  We only got one minute for the next break, but speak to this extinction rebellion element
[3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:57.480]  because that ties directly into the vegan and animal rights movement, right?
[3:33:57.480 --> 3:33:58.480]  Absolutely.
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:02.720]  It also ties into a lot of the work that you do, the occult symbolism, these occult ritual
[3:34:02.720 --> 3:34:08.920]  aspects of a lot of the agit prop, street theater propaganda that you see that's basically
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:13.600]  like Soviet style agit prop from groups like Extinction Rebellion, which of course are
[3:34:13.600 --> 3:34:17.480]  funded through organizations like Avaz, funded by 350.org.
[3:34:17.480 --> 3:34:23.320]  I mean, we're talking about these big money foundations, again, huge pharmaceutical foundations
[3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:28.040]  like the Wellcome Trust, also involved in pushing this climate crisis rhetoric.
[3:34:28.040 --> 3:34:31.560]  They're out there in the streets with their offshoot group called Animal Rebellion.
[3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:33.240]  What is Animal Rebellion doing?
[3:34:33.240 --> 3:34:38.320]  They're going to McDonald's and demanding climate action now through a plant-based
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:44.600]  food system, and the UN is going to try to push plant-based dietary regulations globally
[3:34:44.600 --> 3:34:45.600]  for everybody.
[3:34:45.600 --> 3:34:46.600]  All right.
[3:34:46.600 --> 3:34:47.600]  Hold on.
[3:34:47.600 --> 3:34:48.600]  All that thought, Tristan, we'll be right back.
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:50.920]  This is the Allusion Jones Show.

[3:35:52.800 --> 3:35:57.480]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:06.120]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:15.480]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[3:36:15.480 --> 3:36:16.480]  worsted slaves.
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:23.320]  It's just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile minions
[3:36:23.320 --> 3:36:27.840]  of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:33.040]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:37.840]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:38.840]  It's that choice.
[3:36:38.840 --> 3:36:42.120]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[3:36:42.120 --> 3:36:46.440]  And it's the only choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[3:36:46.440 --> 3:36:52.840]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:57.960]  The entire new world order system is about making you feel pathetic, making you feel
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:02.560]  weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't take your birthright as being
[3:37:02.560 --> 3:37:08.360]  made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny we have being given free will.
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:14.440]  Being given free will, being given consciousness is literally the seed of an entire universe,
[3:37:14.440 --> 3:37:16.440]  an entire system.
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:19.520]  And the fact that you're able to commune with God, the fact that you're able to see
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:23.920]  the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the waves in the ocean or the beauty of your
[3:37:23.920 --> 3:37:28.880]  wife or your husband or the beauty of your child learning knowledge, the beauty of music,
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:33.800]  the fact that you can commune with that and resonate with that is energetic and that itself
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:37.160]  is what God teaches us is worship.
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:41.200]  So don't worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:46.200]  the system, but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:51.600]  consciousness and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[3:38:46.200 --> 3:39:15.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I am here with the vanquisher of vegans, the Diva
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:16.480]  of Diet.
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:20.240]  In fact, he's the world's first trans-vegan, which means that he just simply identifies
[3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:24.640]  as a vegan, but he gets the benefits of eating all the meat that he wants, Tristan Haggard
[3:39:24.640 --> 3:39:25.640]  of Primal Edge Health.
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:30.360]  We were talking about extinction, rebellion, how this is a fake-funded billionaire thing.
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:37.320]  Can you tell us more about that and why this propaganda is so heavy everywhere now?
[3:39:37.320 --> 3:39:42.320]  Yeah, yeah, well, like we were finishing off there in the last segment, it's really funny.
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:48.240]  When you actually look at the so-called activism of these groups and what they do now, it's
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:52.520]  so blatantly obvious to anybody that's been studying these things, anybody that actually
[3:39:52.520 --> 3:39:58.120]  cares about health, anybody that actually cares about real environmental issues, which
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:39:59.120]  there are, right?
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:05.200]  Like Monsanto is a huge environmental hazard, not only to us, but to future generations because
[3:40:05.200 --> 3:40:08.920]  of the destruction of the top soil, because of the chelation of the soil that comes along
[3:40:08.920 --> 3:40:09.920]  with it, right?
[3:40:09.920 --> 3:40:13.400]  But you never hear these groups fighting against Monsanto anymore, right?
[3:40:13.400 --> 3:40:18.240]  The animal rights activists, they're out there fighting against the mean murderers of Babe
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:19.240]  the Pig.
[3:40:19.240 --> 3:40:22.920]  They've got this anthropomorphized ideal of what animals are.
[3:40:22.920 --> 3:40:25.840]  They've been programmed by Disney films since they're little babies.
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:33.800]  They're used to looking at cartoon animals with human eyes in basically ritual traumatic
[3:40:33.800 --> 3:40:37.360]  situations that Disney has presented to them.
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:40.520]  This extinction rebellion group, when you look at one of their most recent so-called
[3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:52.400]  activism displays, it was essentially a bunch of like degenerate millennial and Gen Z pale,
[3:40:52.400 --> 3:41:00.160]  pasty, sickly sweat hogs going and sitting inside of McDonald's and saying, we want
[3:41:00.160 --> 3:41:03.560]  McDonald's to sell us more plant-based kibble.
[3:41:03.560 --> 3:41:04.920]  That's legitimately what they did.
[3:41:04.920 --> 3:41:10.520]  They went and they did a, and if you look at the BBC and like the Guardian, they put
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:12.760]  out these articles and they called them rebels, right?
[3:41:12.760 --> 3:41:19.560]  They say extinction rebels swore McDonald's and demand a plant-based food system, which
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:23.400]  this call for a so-called plant-based food system, we've been seeing from groups like
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:28.760]  350.org, you've been seeing Eat Glancet, this Eat Glancet committee that's associated
[3:41:28.760 --> 3:41:34.480]  with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, of course, pushing for planetary
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:36.480]  dietary guidelines.
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:41.720]  And those planetary dietary guidelines are right in line with what you see from Harvard,
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:45.720]  what you see from a lot of these fake, quackademics that are funded by the likes of people like
[3:41:45.720 --> 3:41:50.800]  Bill Gates, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Welcome Trust, and that is minimal meat intake.
[3:41:50.800 --> 3:41:57.160]  We're talking about less than half a hamburger worth of meat per month and instead replacing
[3:41:57.160 --> 3:42:02.560]  that with things like lentils and beans they claim, right?
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:06.560]  Whereas in reality, people who bypass meat, guess what they go to?
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:07.560]  They go to fake meat.
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:08.560]  They go to the soy.
[3:42:08.560 --> 3:42:14.320]  They go to the GMO corn-based factory food, McKibble, and that's what they want, a global
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:21.360]  McMono culture that's eating a global homo-McKibble diet so that everybody can be of course controlled
[3:42:21.360 --> 3:42:23.280]  at the fundamental cellular level.
[3:42:23.280 --> 3:42:29.560]  Remember, these people have actually done experiments with and developed vaccine-producing
[3:42:29.560 --> 3:42:31.720]  genetically modified crops.
[3:42:31.720 --> 3:42:38.080]  So you have no idea what you're getting as far as not just the epicyte sterilization
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:39.080]  corn.
[3:42:39.080 --> 3:42:43.480]  We could be seeing actual vaccines spread through crops.
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:44.920]  I'm trying to freak people out.
[3:42:44.920 --> 3:42:48.960]  But look, if you are getting locally produced food, if you're producing food on your own
[3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:53.880]  land, if you're looking at something like milk, right, something like grass-fed beef,
[3:42:53.880 --> 3:42:58.600]  you are looking at an animal that eats nothing but indigestible cellulose and fiber that
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:00.480]  we can't digest, right?
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:02.800]  They're fed on, I've got a bunch of animals outside right now.
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:04.040]  They're eating nothing but grass, right?
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:05.320]  They make me milk.
[3:43:05.320 --> 3:43:06.600]  They make me cheese.
[3:43:06.600 --> 3:43:08.100]  They make me yogurt.
[3:43:08.100 --> 3:43:09.760]  We got to make the cheese and the yogurt from the milk.
[3:43:09.760 --> 3:43:11.480]  But they produce beef for us.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:15.080]  They give us all the vitamins and minerals and nutrients that we require in the most
[3:43:15.080 --> 3:43:19.440]  bio-digestible and easily assimilable form, right?
[3:43:19.440 --> 3:43:25.600]  Animals are the only producers of protein and fat that you have in its bio-available
[3:43:25.600 --> 3:43:28.120]  digestible and healthy form for human beings.
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:32.480]  You're not going to get healthy fat from soy oil, from corn oil, right?
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:38.440]  These are all associated with increased cancer, increased infectious disease, increased auto-immune
[3:43:38.440 --> 3:43:43.720]  diseases from all the pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and whoever knows what other types
[3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:47.280]  of proteins are being produced in these genetically modified foods, that's what they want you
[3:43:47.280 --> 3:43:48.680]  dependent on, right?
[3:43:48.680 --> 3:43:52.720]  So these fake grassroots organizations out there, rolling out the red carpet for groups
[3:43:52.720 --> 3:43:57.840]  like the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the World Wildlife Fund, and
[3:43:57.840 --> 3:44:06.480]  Rockefeller Foundation-funded fake NGOs are pushing for more GMO, McMonoculture, kibble.
[3:44:06.480 --> 3:44:07.480]  That's what they want you eating.
[3:44:07.480 --> 3:44:13.480]  They want you in a global McMonoculture, eating the global McMonoculture, McMonocrop, kibble,
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:14.480]  right?
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:17.320]  And that's why they get all the celebrities out there telling you, oh, you go vegan,
[3:44:17.320 --> 3:44:18.320]  it's good for the animals.
[3:44:18.320 --> 3:44:19.320]  Don't you care about the animals?
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:20.320]  Don't you care about the animals?
[3:44:20.320 --> 3:44:21.320]  What they're going to tell you is...
[3:44:21.320 --> 3:44:28.720]  Yeah, remember the Plandopolis videos that came out of that UK think tank about 10 years
[3:44:28.720 --> 3:44:34.440]  ago, and they had all these ready-made graphics and cartoons telling us what they were going
[3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:38.480]  to do, how they were going to roll this out that we're seeing right now, and you remember
[3:44:38.480 --> 3:44:39.480]  those cartoons, it was the...
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:40.480]  Oh, it's your birthday.
[3:44:40.480 --> 3:44:41.480]  You know what that means?
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:49.280]  On your birthday, you get two ounces of meat, you just got to go take your vaccine and ride
[3:44:49.280 --> 3:44:54.880]  over to the central plastic city center and get your two ounces of meat on your birthday.
[3:44:54.880 --> 3:44:58.040]  Then you can wait another year and get another two ounces of meat on your birthday.
[3:44:58.040 --> 3:44:59.040]  Right?
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:00.040]  Two ounces of meat.
[3:45:00.040 --> 3:45:01.040]  This is something ridiculous.
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:02.280]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[3:45:02.280 --> 3:45:08.640]  You're allotted slot based on the carbon credits and whatnot of, oh, you get two ounces of
[3:45:08.640 --> 3:45:09.640]  meat.
[3:45:09.640 --> 3:45:10.640]  It's your birthday.
[3:45:10.640 --> 3:45:11.640]  Absolutely.
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:12.640]  Absolutely.
[3:45:12.640 --> 3:45:16.720]  And of course, these are the most important foods for us.
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:20.640]  When you look at the studies they've done of vegan-vegetarian populations, you see lower
[3:45:20.640 --> 3:45:22.920]  birth weight in the children.
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:28.200]  You see slower growth curves, and on average, vegan and vegetarian children are one to two
[3:45:28.200 --> 3:45:33.400]  inches shorter than their omnivorous friends and family.
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:34.400]  Right?
[3:45:34.400 --> 3:45:35.400]  So they've studied these things.
[3:45:35.400 --> 3:45:37.960]  And you know this from your own experience, right?
[3:45:37.960 --> 3:45:39.920]  You guys had a child.
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:42.640]  You had a vegan diet for that child for a while, right?
[3:45:42.640 --> 3:45:43.640]  And then you came...
[3:45:43.640 --> 3:45:44.640]  No, no, no.
[3:45:44.640 --> 3:45:45.640]  We never fed our kids a vegan diet.
[3:45:45.640 --> 3:45:51.520]  But before conception, we were on kind of a more vegan-ish diet, never sold on the ideology
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:52.520]  of it.
[3:45:52.520 --> 3:45:56.560]  But we were eating a very meat-depleted diet, and we saw dental carries in our child, right?
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:46:00.320]  Which is, of course, crumbling of the teeth, like you see a lot of kids with dental issues
[3:46:00.320 --> 3:46:02.360]  these days, and they'll blame the mother.
[3:46:02.360 --> 3:46:04.160]  They'll say, you're breastfeeding your child.
[3:46:04.160 --> 3:46:07.720]  The breast milk, the dentist will say, your breast milk is bad for your child.
[3:46:07.720 --> 3:46:12.200]  So we did a little bit more research and realized that some of the most important nutrients
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:17.680]  for developing the central nervous system and the dental structure of children, they
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:18.680]  come from animals.
[3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:19.680]  Right?
[3:46:19.680 --> 3:46:23.760]  You're looking at vitamin A, vitamin K2, vitamin D. These are fat-soluble vitamins that are
[3:46:23.760 --> 3:46:26.800]  found in the fat of animals, right?
[3:46:26.800 --> 3:46:31.120]  Those are the most important nutrients that we are missing, especially in our depleted
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:32.120]  diet.
[3:46:32.120 --> 3:46:36.720]  So we started implementing a more fat-based and meat-based diet, giving our child bone
[3:46:36.720 --> 3:46:46.560]  broth, bone marrow, very iodine-rich, DHA-rich, fat-soluble vitamin-rich foods.
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:48.600]  And of course, her teeth hardened up.
[3:46:48.600 --> 3:46:51.520]  She's got her adult teeth now, and her adult teeth are perfectly normal.
[3:46:51.520 --> 3:46:54.760]  Our second child had no issues with his teeth.
[3:46:54.760 --> 3:46:58.600]  Now we've known, because we live in a community where a lot of people are kind of like, you
[3:46:58.600 --> 3:47:04.720]  know, a lot of people are going towards self-sustaining lifestyle, self-sustainable farming and whatnot,
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:08.560]  you get to know people who are trying vegetarian and vegan diets long-term and even feeding
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:09.880]  them to their kids.
[3:47:09.880 --> 3:47:14.240]  And I've seen so many of these, there's things that happen across the board with vegans,
[3:47:14.240 --> 3:47:15.240]  vegetarians.
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:20.280]  Number one, their kids' teeth go to hell, basically.
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:22.560]  Their kids' teeth start crumbling.
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:26.520]  They get black spots, brown spots in their teeth.
[3:47:26.520 --> 3:47:33.720]  They also have behavioral issues, almost like autism-type behavioral disconnections, which
[3:47:33.720 --> 3:47:37.480]  you see across the board in these vegan and vegetarian children.
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:42.520]  And these people who are pushing these diets at the top level, there are people who study
[3:47:42.520 --> 3:47:43.520]  this.
[3:47:43.520 --> 3:47:49.080]  They understand the repercussions to our health, to our behavior as well.
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:54.240]  When you look at low cholesterol, low cholesterol, which is just promoted across the board, it's
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:47:55.440]  this wonderful thing, right?
[3:47:55.440 --> 3:47:59.080]  High cholesterol causes heart disease, they tell you, which is an absolute lie.
[3:47:59.080 --> 3:48:01.720]  They tell you that high cholesterol is going to kill you when the people that live the
[3:48:01.720 --> 3:48:04.800]  longest have high cholesterol and eat the most meat.
[3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:08.760]  They tell you cholesterol is bad, but when you look at populations with low cholesterol,
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:13.680]  when you look at violent criminals, or they've done studies on violent criminals and people
[3:48:13.680 --> 3:48:18.200]  who are depressed and suicidal, they have found that low cholesterol is highly associated
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:22.560]  with risk-seeking behavior because you're starving, right?
[3:48:22.560 --> 3:48:27.920]  And then also violent crime, depression, suicide, and anxiety.
[3:48:27.920 --> 3:48:36.440]  This is not just, you're going to be, hey, hey, hey, I got it, 1.4 burgers a month.
[3:48:36.440 --> 3:48:37.440]  I got it.
[3:48:37.440 --> 3:48:38.440]  I got it.
[3:48:38.440 --> 3:48:39.440]  Did you see the Biden whisper clip?
[3:48:39.440 --> 3:48:40.440]  I knew you.
[3:48:40.440 --> 3:48:41.440]  I knew you.
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:50.040]  They just found an article where Biden was saying that he wants Americans to have one
[3:48:50.040 --> 3:48:52.040]  burger a month as the limit.
[3:48:52.040 --> 3:48:53.040]  Yeah.
[3:48:53.040 --> 3:48:54.040]  Well, Kamala Harris promoted it.
[3:48:54.040 --> 3:48:57.520]  She said, she was asking, I think it was like CNN, and then asked her, would you help
[3:48:57.520 --> 3:48:59.640]  them to reduce people's meat consumption?
[3:48:59.640 --> 3:49:00.800]  She said, absolutely.
[3:49:00.800 --> 3:49:02.520]  We should reduce our meat consumption.
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:03.520]  All right.
[3:49:03.520 --> 3:49:06.960]  And of course, these recommendations for cutting the meat down.
[3:49:06.960 --> 3:49:12.120]  This comes from the Eat Lancet Committee, which is associated with the Lancet, which
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:15.720]  is associated with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, which you're
[3:49:15.720 --> 3:49:17.720]  looking at like, Manstanto, Bayer.
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:18.720]  All right.
[3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:19.720]  We're going to have to wrap it up.
[3:49:19.720 --> 3:49:23.160]  Tristan, tell everybody where to find you and what you've got coming.
[3:49:23.160 --> 3:49:24.160]  Awesome.

[3:49:27.400 --> 3:49:29.120]  We got some cookbooks up there.
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:34.080]  Here's a copy of our cookbook, the Carnivore cookbook, zero-carb recipes for people who
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:36.080]  really love animals.
[3:49:36.080 --> 3:49:39.880]  And you can find me over on Rockfin, Tristan Haggard on Rockfin, you can find me on YouTube.
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:40.880]  And all right.
